<TEXT>
   North Dakota, South Dakota and Oklahoma
were left out of Rand McNally's newly published world atlas, and
Oklahoma Gov. Henry Bellmon is not the least amused.
   Bellmon's spokesman, Sam Armstrong, issued a memo the governor
planned to send to Rand McNally from ``3.3 million citizens of the
great state of Oklahoma.''
   ``We are mystified,'' Bellmon says in the memo. ``Did you intend
an insult or are you trying to say that Oklahoma is so well-known
that travelers need no map to get here? The latter seems more
likely.
   ``We do not need your incomplete atlas,'' Bellmon said. ``You
won't get our business.''
   Rand McNally officials said the three states were omitted from
the new atlas' regional maps and photographs because of space
limitations.
   ``It was an editorial decision,'' said Con Erickson, a public
relations representative in Rand McNally's Skokie, Ill., office.
   The $34.95 Rand McNally Photographic World Atlas hits newstands
and bookstores this month.
   North Dakota's tourism director said he's not especially
troubled by the omission.
   ``It sounds to me like this is an upscale book for the world
traveler, who, frankly, may or may not be interested in the Great
Plains region,'' Tourism Director James Fuglie said Thursday.
``It's a coffee table book. It's not like we missed the road
atlas.''
   The atlas, which features brilliantly colored photographs of
various regions of the world, breaks the United States down into
seven regions: Northeast, Great Lakes, Southeast, Mississippi
Valley, Southern Rocky Mountains, Northwest and California and
Nevada.
   Photos from those seven regions are included, and accompanying
maps show at least a portion of 47 states.
   Bonnie Ryan, a Rand McNally public relations representative,
said the omission was not intended as an affront to the three
states.
   ``They did include several regions of the United States and
their portfolios, just kind of touching upon various places,'' she
said. ``Now that this has come up, they realize this was not a good
idea, and they really should include the entire U.S.
   ``In any case, I have been told that when they go back to print
next year, they're planning changes which include adding more maps
to the U.S.,'' Ryan said.
   Fuglie said Rand McNally's concern is selling books and it is
natural that the company would want to concentrate on areas of the
United States that are particularly attractive to world travelers,
such as the East and West coasts and the South.
   But he added, ``If this was a book designed to reach ... the
markets that we seek tourists from, I would be very concerned.''

   One University of Mississippi student was
expelled and four others suspended Friday for their involvement in
a fraternity prank that turned into an embarrassing racial incident
for the school.
   ``We regret that this action had to be taken, but it should be
clear that the University of Mississippi can not tolerate this kind
of behavior,'' said Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner, who accepted
the recommendation of a disciplinary committee that had held
hearings for each of the students.
   On Sept. 18, a Beta Theta Pi member and a pledge were stripped,
blindfolded and driven from Ole Miss to Rust College, a small,
private, mostly black school about 25 miles to the north in Holly
Springs.
   Rust security officers picked up the Ole Miss students, whose
hands and feet had been bound with duct tape and their naked bodies
painted with ``KKK'' and ``we hate niggers.'' The students were all
white.
   Those involved were not identified, nor did the university
specify their roles in the incident.
   Turner expelled one fraternity member, suspended four and placed
nine others on probation. Charges aganst one student were dropped.
   Last Wednesday, the chancellor banned Beta Theta Pi from the
school for three years and ordered the fraternity to close its
house on fraternity row by Oct. 29.
   Beta Theta Pi members have said the incident was a traditional
fraternity prank that got out of hand. Fraternity members said
pledges usually ``kidnapped'' an active member and left him
stranded in a remote area, but never had the prank been taken so
far.
   Turner said last week that the incident had opened an old wound
at Ole Miss, the scene of violence in 1962 when James Meredith
enrolled as the first black student.
   ``We are committed to developing an environment on campus that
is supportive of the goals and aspirations of all members of the
university community,'' the chancellor said Friday. ``We must now
reinvigorate our efforts in this direction.''

   A nursing home fire blamed on careless
smoking filled the four-story building with thick smoke that killed
nine elderly residents and sent nearly 100 to hospitals, officials
said Friday.
   The fire gutted the second-floor room where it began, but did
little damage to the rest of the brick building. The home does not
have a sprinkler system; none was required when it was built in
1969.
   ``Even though we lost nine people, the potential was there to
lose significantly more than that,'' said Fire Chief Thomas E.
Gardner.
   The Thursday night blaze at the four-story Hillhaven
Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center began when a resident, Major
Leary, 78, accidentally tossed a match on his bed while smoking
against regulations in his second floor-room, said Capt. Herbert
Redfield, chief of fire investigations.
   Leary died in the blaze but his roommate, Roy Miller, escaped
without serious injury, said Fire Chief Thomas E. Gardner.
   Residents of the 172-bed nursing home, some in bedclothes and
some naked, were helped down halls and down ladders as firefighters
tackled the fire. The blaze broke out at 10:20 p.m. as residents
were going to bed.
   Gardner said many residents stayed in their rooms with the doors
closed while firefighters used a pressurized ventilation system
called a smoke blaster to clear smoke from the building.
   Resident Katie Gwaltney, 88, said she was told to stay in her
fourth-floor room after she heard a fire alarm.
   ``They came and told us that everything was OK,'' she said from
a wheelchair outside the home. ``I couldn't get out. I just lay so
still.''
   Ninety-eight of the nursing home's 163 residents were taken to
hospitals for treatment of smoke inhalation, said Don Haupt,
administrator of the city's Paramedial Rescue Service.
   Seven remained hospitalized Friday, six in critical condition,
said Rhonda S. Hoover, a spokeswoman for Sentara Norfolk General
Hospital.
   The fire chief said the fire would have been less severe if the
20-year-old building had a sprinkler system. ``If it were
sprinkled, then probably some of them would not have died,'' he
said.
   State codes in 1969 did not require sprinklers in nursing homes.
Howard H. Summers Jr., the state's chief fire marshal, said any
multi-story nursing home constructed today would have to include a
sprinkler system but a single-story building could be built without
one if it included fire-resistant construction materials.
   Gardner said he would urge state lawmakers to require that
buildings such as the nursing homes be retrofitted with sprinklers.
   Hillhaven will consider installing sprinklers, but they are
difficult to place in existing buildings, said Jeffrey M. McKain, a
regional vice president for The Hillhaven Corp., a Tacoma,
Wash.-based chain that owns the home.
   McKain said smoking is prohibited in bedrooms. The home has
smoke and heat detectors and fire resistant doors and ``it appeared
most of those systems all functioned as they should,'' he said.
   One of the injured residents, Elijah Williams, 85, said he heard
no fire alarm in his second-floor room but knew something was wrong
when he heard noise on the first floor.
   ``I went to the window and I saw that smoke,'' he said.
   Williams said he was rescued by a firefighter who brought him
down a ladder and left him outside the buiding.
   ``I didn't know what to do,'' Williams said from Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital. ``I didn't have nothing on, nothing but my
nightclothes.''
   There were about 200 people in the building when the fire broke
out, McKain said. He said damage was so minimal on the third and
fourth floors that residents might return there in a few days. He
had no damage estimate.
   At least two residents went home with their families and the
others were placed in hospitals and nursing homes, McKain said.
Haupt said 141 people were transported to hospitals or nursing
homes.
   The nursing home passed two inspections this years, said Charles
Ford, a Virginia Department of Health spokesman. In February, the
fire marshal's office conducted an inspection for the health
department as a followup to an inspection last Nov. 18 that found
three minor violations of fire safety regulations, Ford said. All
three problems had been corrected by the time of the February
recheck, he said.

   Armed only with a cucumber, which he pretended was
a shotgun, a 36-year-old man stole $19,868 in 16 holdups over two
months to finance a drug habit, a prosecutor said.
   Pointing the cucumber wrapped in a plastic bag at terrified
cashiers and screaming ``Give me the money or I'll blow your head
off!'' the man raided 15 financial institutions and a post office,
prosecutor Michael Warren told London's Old Bailey Central Criminal
Court.
   Ernest Coveley pleaded guilty to 10 counts of robbery and six
counts of attempted robbery.
   He had initially faced 16 charges of using fake weapons in the
raids. But his plea of innocent to these was accepted by the court
on grounds that cucumbers cannot be classed as imitation firearms.
   Judge Edwin Jowitt postponed sentencing until he reviews social
and psychiatric reports on Coveley.
   Coveley's attorney, Peter Feinberg, told the judge that a
cucumber ``is not the choice of a man who is perhaps more
professionally geared for robbery.''
   Security cameras filmed the man as he held up a savings and loan
office in east London, Warren said. Police later arrested him at
his apartment.
   Warren said Coveley undertook the raids to finance his addiction
to cocaine and heroin. He said Coveley used a fresh cucumber for
each raid.

<HEAD>Kansas City Newspapers To Combine In One Morning Edition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas City's two jointly owned daily
newspapers will merge into one morning edition, newspaper
executives announced Thursday.
   Employees were told Thursday of changes planned for The Kansas
City Star, published afternoons Monday through Friday and Sunday
mornings, and The Kansas City Times, published mornings Monday
through Saturday.
   The new paper will be called The Kansas City Star. The date of
the merger has not been decided.
   Officials had announced recently that they were studying a
possible merger. McGuff, who discussed the plans at a news
conference with
   Publisher James H. Hale said he expects the merger to occur ``in
the first half of next year, or sooner.''
   The Kansas City Star Co., which publishes both newspapers, is
owned by Capital Cities-ABC Inc., which bought it from company
employees in 1977. Hale said the merger decision was made locally
on Wednesday.
   He said no layoffs are planned.
   Hale said declining circulation of The Star was a factor in the
decision. The Star, started in 1880 by William Rockhill Nelson and
Samuel E. Morss, purchased the 33-year-old Times in 1901 and ran it
as the Star's morning edition.
   When employees bought the newspapers from the Nelson estate in
1926, The Star's circulation was 392,000, The Times' 249,000. By
1965, the morning paper had moved ahead and The Star's circulation,
like many other afternoon papers, continued to erode. In September,
unaudited circulation of The Times was 270,719 and the weekday
Star's was 165,866. The Sunday circulation last month was 416,673.
   The decision to drop afternoon publication follows a trend among
metropolitan newspapers around the country. On Monday, officials of
The News and Observor Publishing Co. in North Carolina announced
that The Raleigh Times, an afternoon newspaper, would cease
publication Nov. 30. The company will continue publishing The News
and Observer, a morning paper.
   Editor Joe McGuff said the merger is a response to a marketplace
where people have less leisure time and more to do.
   McGuff said he was saddened that some employees will face
changes from day to night shifts and that some longtime and loyal
readers will no longer have their afternoon papers.
   ``But once you get past those two elements, then I feel very
excited about what we are going to do in the future,'' he said. ``I
think all of us look forward, once we get through this period of
transition, to an exciting prospect of putting out a bigger, better
and more complete newspaper.''
   He and Hale said the change will enable the company to expand
news coverage and create new beats for reporters.

   Saying ``God is waiting for you,'' a naked woman
pushed two of her children out a 10th-floor window Thursday,
killing her 6-year-old daughter and critically injuring her
3-year-old son, officials said.
   Rescuers stormed the apartment in time to save a third child, a
1-year-old girl, as she was being shoved through the window's
safety bars, officials said.
   The mother, Meenhah Abdussalaam, 32, her daughter, Zainab, and
son Husein were taken to St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Queens, a
borough of New York, authorities said.
   Zainab died of her injuries, said Nancy Uzo, a spokeswoman for
St. John's. Husein was transferred from St. John's to North Shore
University Hospital on Long Island, where he was in extremely
critical condition on a respirator after surgery, said Carol
Hauptman, spokeswoman for North Shore.
   Both suffered massive internal injuries, fractures and cardiac
arrest, said Charles De Gaetano of the Emergency Medical Services.
The mother, who was not physically injured, was being evaluated at
the hospital.
   Mrs. Abdussalaam was taken into custody at 2:20 p.m., five
minutes after the children fell from the Queens apartment, said
police spokesman Detective Joseph McConville. She was not
immediately charged.
   ``She was mumbling `Mohammed, Elijah.' She was trying to move
the children along to the window to jump and she was going to jump
also,'' said Fire Lt. John Lane, who was one of the first rescuers
on the scene.
   ``She told the children, `God is waiting for you,'' said Lane,
who added that they were all naked.
   ``The only thing that saved them was there was a window guard,''
which made it difficult to push the children out the window, he
said.
   Neighbors described Mrs. Abdussalaam as quiet and polite, a good
mother and a devout Moslem, whose husband had recently moved out.
   ``Her husband left her last week and she went crazy,'' said one
neighbor, Zulfar Sahar.
   Firefighters passing the 20-story building on the way back to
their station ``saw one child, a girl, hanging by her hands from
the window ledge of the apartment,'' said Fire Department spokesman
Efrain Parilla.
   ``They started shouting `don't jump' and as they did so, they
saw the child trying to get back on the ledge. ... She lifted a leg
and tried to get back on the ledge, then the firefighters saw an
arm come out of the window and push the child away,'' Parilla said.
   The firefighters reached the scene as the girl fell on dirt in
front of the building. ``We looked up and saw the arms and legs of
another young child hanging out the same window,'' Lane said.
   ``We said `Oh God, don't jump, we're here, we want to help
you,'' the 28-year-veteran firefighter said, his voice shaking with
emotion during a telephone interview.
   The rescuers then broke down the apartment door, and the door to
a bedroom, where the mother had barricaded herself in with the
children, McConville said.
   The officers managed to grab the mother as she was sliding her
1-year-old daughter, Amna, out between the window bars.
   ``She was mumbling `Mohammed, Elijah,' she was trying to move
the children along to the window to jump and she was going to jump
also,'' said Fire Lt. John Lane, who was one of the first rescuers
on the scene.
   ``She told the children, `God is waiting for you,'' Lane said.
   ``The only thing that saved them was there was a window guard,''
which made it difficult to push the children out the window, he
added.
   Two other children, identified as an 8-year-old boy, Askia, and
a 4-year-old girl, Fatima, were in the apartment but were not
harmed. It was not known if they saw their siblings being pushed
out the window, police said.
   The children's father, Sultan Abdussalaam, 35, is separated from
the mother and was at work at the time of the incident, police said.
   The woman recently had received notice that she was going to be
evicted from her five-room apartment, but police did not know
whether the notice had had any effect on her behavior.
   Ann Sessa, president of the building's tenant association, said
the couple had lived without incident in the building for 12 years,
and said Mrs. Abdussalaam was ``very careful with the children.''
   The children were always clean and polite. ``It was always,
`Yes, M'am,' `No, M'am.' They're really nice children. They're not
wild.''

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some chant. Some meditate. Some
dance. Some sit in the lotus position and hum.
   Every year hundreds of devotees of the occult trek to Giza
Plateau near Cairo to absorb mystical vibes said to be trapped
inside the pyramids of the pharaohs Cheops, Chephren and Mycerinus.
   Pyramid power is said to cure a host of ills, give glimpses into
the future, provide a better night's sleep, even halt aging _ all
for the price of admission, three Egyptian pounds ($1.20).
   Until now.
   Under new rules, pyramid groupies are going to have to pay more
_ a lot more.
   Zahi Hawass, Giza Plateau's director general, said groups of up
to 15 now are allowed ``to meditate or seek extrasensory powers''
in the pyramids for 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($400) and only outside
normal tourist hours. Each extra participant pays 50 pounds ($20).
   Hawass said seven to eight groups ask permission each month to
conduct seances inside the pyramids. Most want either to spend the
night inside or to enter at the first rays of dawn.
   ``In the U.S. and elsewhere you have a lot of people with
problems, and these people are seeking solutions. They look to the
supernatural, and they think of the pyramids,'' Hawass said.
   ``But we can't let these groups interfere with tourists wanting
to look at the pyramids from a historical or architectural
standpoint.''
   Hawass said the most active pyramid-visiting mystical groups in
the United States are several from Santa Barbara, Calif., and from
the Edgar Cayce Foundation of Virginia Beach, Va., named after the
American psychic who died in 1945. Cayce taught that the secrets of
Atlantis and knowledge of the future are buried under the right
front paw of the Sphinx at the foot of Giza Plateau.
   In addition to Americans,theme cruises are organized in Europe
and growing numbers of Japanese tours come to Giza especially to
``tap pyramid power,'' Hawass said.
   ``This pyramid power stuff is really big,'' he said. ``People
want to believe in magic, and big structures give an air of magic.
I'm sure if I called myself the Pyramid Prophet I could have a
following larger than the most famous Indian guru.''
   Built about 4,600 years ago, the pyramids remain enigmas to
scientists as well as to seekers of the unknown.
   The first person to enter the Great Pyramid of Cheops in
post-pharaonic times was the caliph of Baghdad, Abdullah al-Ma'mun,
in 820 A.D. He forced his way in by heating rocks, then breaking
them by pouring on vinegar.
   As generations of scientists and tourists, eccentrics and
treasure hunters followed him, pyramid mystique grew over the ages.
   Perhaps the most famous personality to enter in search of the
occult was Napoleon Bonaparte, who spent the night of Aug. 12,
1799, inside Cheops' pyramid and emerged ashen and shaken.
   He went to his grave in 1821 without telling what he experienced.
   ``No! What's the use,'' Napoleon was said to have told a friend.
``You wouldn't believe me anyway.''
   Hawass said many people, especially in the United States, have
ideas and theories about the Giza pyramids, particularly Cheops'
Great Pyramid.
   ``They read that Cheops is made of 2.3 million blocks, each one
weighing 2{ tons to 15 tons, each side at an angle of 51 degrees,
50 minutes and 35 seconds,'' he said.
   ``They think nobody on Earth could have built this. That the
pyramids were built by people from outer space, or survivors from
the lost continent of Atlantis.
   ``They never look at what's attached to the pyramids, the
structures, the organization necessary to build them, the cult of
the king.''
   He said more than 200 books about pyramid power have been
published in the United States, ``but fewer than half a dozen
contain any science of value.''
   Hawass, who has a doctorate in Egyptology from the University of
Pennsylvania and has lectured throughout North America about the
pyramids, said he'd never heard of pyramid power until he went
there in 1977.
   ``I was speaking to an audience in Hartford, Conn., and as I
began to talk everyone in the front row held a pyramid above his
head. I asked, `What are you doing?,' and they explained about
power trapped inside the shape of a pyramid.
   ``OK. I try to be open-minded. When I returned, I tried some
experiments.''
   The first was to test the theory that pyramids can preserve
bodies.
   ``I bought some meat and put part of it in my office, part
inside Cheops. The meat inside my office lasted longer than inside
the pyramid. That was one (myth) down.
   ``If the ancient Egyptians knew that flesh could be preserved by
placing a corpse under a pyramid, then why did they invent
mummification?''

<HEAD>Tufts University Abolishes Speech-Limiting Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free speech, including the right to wear
offensive T-shirts, has returned to the campus of Tufts University
after President Jean Mayer decided a ban on verbal attacks wouldn't
wash in court.
   ``I have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of
free speech,'' Tufts President Jean Mayer said Thursday in an
interview. ``We decided we would decide each case on its merits.''
   Student body president Billy Jacobson, 20, of Roslyn, N.Y., said
he was sorry to see the abolition of a policy supported by most of
the 7,000 students at the private school about six miles north of
Boston.
   ``It was well-intended,'' Jacobson said. ``The university has a
responsibility to protect students. It can't insulate students, but
this is their home and students shouldn't have to worry about going
into their dorms and their dining halls and seeing something
offensive to them.''
   The policy published in the student handbook barred verbal
attacks, whether spoken or written, against an individual's race,
ethnic group, religion or sexual orientation.
   The policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an
enterprising student marketed a T-shirt stating 15 reasons ``Why
Beer is Better than Women at Tufts.'' All 15 reasons disparaged
women, and one printable reason was ``Hangovers go away.''
   The T-shirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50
hours of community service. But Mayer suspended that sentence when
lawyers advised him it was unconstitutional.
   The Student Life Committee, a panel comprising faculty and
students, stepped into the breach and imposed the free speech
restriction last June.
   When it made its way into this year's student handbook and
protests were raised, Mayer decided the policy had to go. He
announced it to students Wednesday through the campus media.
   Mayer said he abolished the restrictive policy in part because
legal opinions vary widely on the matter.
   Some experts say the First Amendment only means to bar the
government from restricting speech and doesn't apply to private
universities, Mayer said. Others say it outlaws muzzling anyone who
says or writes anything short of inciting a riot.
   Additionally, a court ruling found a similar policy at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor was unconstitutional and vague,
Mayer said.
   Bruce Reitman, Tufts associate dean of students, said the issue
of resurgent bigotry on campuses around the country comes up
whenever administrators gather. But he couldn't offer a theory why.
   ``Campuses are more reactionary than they were in the '60s.
There's a new right wing,'' Reitman said. ``We have had our share
of it, similar to other campuses around the country. There's more
tension about these issues than there used to be.''

   A church-affiliated university that
requires students to attend chapel daily says it doesn't want its
MTV because some students were watching nothing but the music video
channel.
   ``A minority of students were monopolizing it,'' David England,
spokesman for David Lipscomb University, said Thursday. ``They were
turning it up and keeping others from using the TV as intended.
This was eliminating the other students' right of choice.
   ``They were playing it so loudly that other students and
professors couldn't carry on conversations.''
   Complaints about the content of some MTV videos also led the
school to block the cable channel from sets in dormitory lounges
and the student center last month, England said.
   ``There is a morality issue and we won't back off what we
perceive to be immoral kinds of things,'' he said. ``We have a lot
of students who don't like what they see on it. We've had far more
complaints about it being on than it being off.''
   The school has an enrollment of 2,500 and is affiliated with the
Churches of Christ, a non-denominational group that preaches basic
Bible teachings.
   Barry Kluger, MTV vice president for corporate communications,
said by telephone from New York City that he regretted the decision.
   ``We feel the programming, after going through our stringent
standards, is appropriate for TV viewers,'' he said.

   Rosebud County authorities say inmate
Westley Deitchler can starve himself to death if he wants, but not
in the county jail.
   District Judge Joe Hegel ordered that Deitchler, who staged a
hunger strike in jail last spring to protest what he considers
unconstitutional government controls, serve a 16-day sentence in
segments of no more than five days each, none of them long enough
to starve to death.
   Deitchler, who went to jail Monday and will have weekends off
until completing the sentence, is none too happy about the
arrangement.
   ``Either I'm a criminal and ought to be in here and should not
be allowed out, or I'm innocent and should not be in here,'' he
said by telephone from the county jail Wednesday. ``I'm not going
to have it both ways.''
   But Gary Ryder, deputy county attorney, says it's a good
solution from the county's point of view.
   ``We don't want him to starve in jail. But on the other hand, he
has to do his time,'' Ryder said.
   Deitchler, 47, of Colstrip, Mont., insists the government has no
right to control his activities.
   In March, he sent letters to authorities canceling his Social
Security account, driver's license, life and car insurance, license
plates and ``all other forms of asking government permission to do
those things which I have a natural right to do.''
   He fashioned homemade wooden license plates reading: ``Free
Man.'' Sheriff's officers spotted him and arrested him on charges
including failure to have car registration, insurance and a
driver's license.
   Deitchler was convicted in April and jailed, but he was released
for health reasons after 14 days when he refused to eat.
   After appealing the conviction to district court, Hegel found
him guilty again and sentenced him to 16 days.
   Deitchler said he's not eating in jail this week. And he said if
he is released for the weekend as scheduled, he doesn't plan on
returning next week.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts Fulton County Sheriff on Extortion Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury Thursday indicted the
sheriff of Georgia's largest county on 27 counts of extortion
involving payments allegedly received from the company providing
food services to the county jail.
   U.S. Attorney Robert L. Barr said the indictment charged Fulton
County Sheriff Richard Lankford with taking more than 20 payments
totaling more than $20,000 from L&amp;G Catering Services between the
fall of 1985 and August 1988.
   It also charged Lankford with attempting to extort additional
payments of $2,000 and $5,000 from L&amp;G Catering as recently as May
of this year, he said.
   The indictment said the payments were made by L&amp;G's managing
owner, Jack LeCroy, at various locations, including the Fulton
County Sheriff's Office. Most of the payments allegedly occurred at
area restaurants.
   Barr said the payments were induced ``by exploiting the
corporation's fear of losing its valuable contract, and by
exploiting (Lankford's) official position.''
   The grand jury also charged Lankford, who has been sheriff since
1985, with filing false federal income tax returns for 1984 through
1987 by omitting the alleged payments.
   Lankford's said he was at Crawford Long Hospital being treated
for kidney stones.
   Barr said Lankford, if convicted, could be sentenced to 20 years
in prison and fined $250,000 on each extortion count. The income
tax charges could carry penalties of three years in prison and
another $250,000 fine.
   The investigation leading up to the indictments was conducted by
the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, Barr said.
   Lankford was charged under the Hobbs Act, a federal statute that
prohibits elected officials from using their offices for personal
gain.

   Comedian Bob Hope and retired Air
Force Col. Bob Gates have been friends ever since they endured a
harrowing flight together in a crippled airplane over Alaska 47
years ago.
   Hope and Gates, a resident of this Florida Panhandle city,
renewed their acquaintance before the entertainer performed in a
benefit for military widows and dependents Thursday.
   Together, they recalled the flight.
   ``It was my first trip overseas. Gates was the co-pilot on the
way to Anchorage, and he almost killed us,'' Hope cracked.
   Gates was a 21-year-old pilot when he was assigned to fly Hope
and other entertainers around Alaska and the Aleutian Islands on a
United Service Organizations tour during World War II.
   ``We took off and went to 14,000 feet over Cordova to miss the
mountains,'' Gates recalled. ``We got all iced up, lost an engine,
the radios went out and only by the grace of God did we escape
being killed.''
   To compound the problem, it was after dark and Elmendorf Air
Force Base where they were trying to land was poorly lighted.
   ``We circled in, broke through the murk and clouds and there was
the airport,'' Gates said. ``That was the worst hour and a half I
ever spent in an airplane in all my 44 years of flying.''
   Hope and Gates keep in contact by telephone and the entertainer
visits every other year or so to put on a show for the Air Force
Enlisted Men's Widows and Dependents Home Foundation.

<HEAD>Ad Agency Says It Expects To Be Indicted for Jamaican Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young &amp; Rubicam, one of the country's largest
advertising agencies, said Thursday it would soon be indicted on
charges that it participated in bribing Jamaican officals to obtain
the Jamaican Tourist Board's ad account in 1981.
   The New York-based agency, which developed the ``Come back to
Jamaica'' ad campaign, also said several of its employees might be
indicted by a federal grand jury as well.
   The grand jury in New Haven, Conn., has been investigating the
relationship between the agency and the Caribbean nation's tourism
authority since 1986, The New York Times reported in Friday
editions.
   A report about the possibility of indictments appeared Wednesday
in The Hartford Courant. That newspaper said two or more Jamaican
officials also might be indicted.
   In a statement Thursday, Young &amp; Rubicam denied any impropriety
in its business dealings.
   ``Y&amp;R has a 66-year record of achievement conducted to the
highest ethical standards,'' the agency said.
   Marty Steinberg, a lawyer for the Jamaican Tourist Board, told
the Times that board officials had been called as witnesses before
the grand jury. He also said the board had been told it was not the
subject of the inquiry.
   Y&amp;R said it, too, cooperated with the grand jury.
   Ruder Finn Inc., a New York public relations agency that once
worked for the tourist board, also said it was under investigation
for that relationship.

<HEAD>Anniversary Celebrations Come As East Germany Is in Turmoil</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Huge red banners proclaiming the triumphs of four
decades of socialism flap in the breeze outside the austere
Communist Party headquarters in East Berlin.
   But as East Germany today begins an extravagant two-day
celebration of its 40th anniversary, it is in turmoil.
   A generation reared on socialist verities is deserting the
country by the tens of thousands, saying their homeland is
unbearable. And dissidents have dug in for a long struggle for
democratic reforms in one of Eastern Europe's most tightly
controlled societies.
   The desperation of many East Germans was underlined this week in
Dresden, where thousands of people shouting ``We want out'' swarmed
the train station hoping to jump on freedom trains rolling to the
West. They were refuffed by police, and some of the would-be
refugees were bloodied in the riot.
   East Germany's aging leaders have rejected the need for
democratic and economic reforms. And while the economy remains the
envy of their East Bloc neighbors, frustration is boiling over
because virtually every facet of life is controlled from above.
   ``I had to join the Communist Youth League and other
organizations or I never would have been allowed to study, to get a
degree or get a good job,'' said a 30-year-old chemist.
   ``We're treated like children and patronized by petty officials
who do everything but tell us when to go to the bathroom.''
   The mass flight West is the No. 1 topic for those left behind.
   ``The place is falling apart, and for good reason,'' said a
39-year-old truck driver from East Berlin.
   ``For years they told us to work hard, that things would get
better. But it was a terrible lie. After awhile you ask yourself
what this is all for because it's getting worse, not better.''
   Many are outraged at the way East Germany's state media have
portrayed daily life in the country and the resulting flight of
refugees West.
   ``The gap between reality and what is officially said has grown
too great,'' said a 25-year-old East Berlin engineering student.
``It used to be just a joke, now it's an outrage that people are
finding more and more difficult to tolerate.''
   He called the 40th anniversary celebrations ``an empty farce.''
   The exodus of thousands of East Germans over Hungary's
newly-open border and the desperate flight of thousands more to
West Germany's embassies in Czechoslovakia and Poland has deeply
embarrassed the hard-line government.
   Those who have fled say they can no longer endure the nation's
tough policy on travel to the West, its intolerance toward dissent
and pluralism and an economy that is still fraught with shortages
and distribution problems.
   Many of their compatriots left behind agreed in conversations
Thursday in East Berlin. They declined to be identified because
they feared reprisals.
   Although East Germans enjoy the highest standard of living in
the Warsaw Pact, there are signs that the economy is slowing down.
   East Germans still wait for up to 15 years for a new car and 10
years for a new apartment.
   Human rights activists and environmental groups are regularly
harassed and their members detained. The government recently
rejected a petition by an opposition group to legally meet on the
grounds that it harbored ``anti-state ideas.''
   Most of East Germany's prominent authors can only publish in
West Germany.
   Life is tougher outside the capital, East Berlin, where
communist authorities have poured millions to help it compete with
the glitter of capitalist West Berlin.
   Residents in Dresden and Leipzig and other provincial cities
trudge through dreary neighborhoods where once elegant
turn-of-the-century buildings have crumbled almost beyond repair.
   While rents and public transport are cheap _ a tram ride still
costs about the same as it did 40 years ago _ the government
subsidies needed to offset the revenue mean there is less money for
renovation.
   For most East Germans, their brutal isolation from the rest of
the world wounds and frustrates them the most.
   East Germany built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to halt the flow of
skilled workers trekking West in record numbers.
   Travel to the West is still strictly limited and the recent
refugee exodus from Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland has brought
unprecedented new travel restrictions to these Soviet bloc allies.
   ``They're drawing the noose tighter and tighter,'' said a
38-year-old secretary who works in an East Berlin government office.
   ``People are already furious about what's going on here.
Something's got to change soon or its going to explode.''

<HEAD>Human Rights, Catholic-Moslem Relations Dominate Pope's Asian Trip</HEAD>

   Pope John Paul II embarks on a politically sensitive
10-day Asian pilgrimage amid calls he speak out on human rights
during stops in South Korea and Indonesia.
   John Paul is scheduled to begin the 44th foreign trip of his
11-year papacy later today with a flight to the South Korean
capital of Seoul, where he will address a religious meeting.
   He then goes on to overwhelmingly Moslem Indonesia and a stop in
East Timor that has provoked protests from Portugal, the island's
former colonial ruler. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and
annexed the heavily Catholic island the following year.
   John Paul will also make a two-day stop in the Indian Ocean
island nation of Mauritius before returning to Rome Oct. 16.
   The pope's route to Asia carries political significance. The
Italian airline Alitalia received permission to fly the leader of
the world's 850 million Roman Catholics over Hungary and the Soviet
Union, a sign of vastly improved Vatican-Soviet relations during
the past year.
   Earlier, China had barred a papal overflight, leading Alitalia
to seek a different route. China broke relations with the Vatican
in 1957.
   Before departing, Asia Watch, an independent human rights
monitoring organization, urged John Paul to speak out on human
rights issues during the trip.
   ``We believe that because of your special role and the worldwide
attention that your visit will attract in South Korea and
Indonesia, your strong expression of concern on human rights would
have an immeasurable impact in furthering respect for human rights
in those countries,'' the group said in a letter to the pope it
released to the news media.
   South Korean police and intelligence agencies were placed on
alert for the pope's weekend visit, his second trip to the country
following a tour in 1984. National Police Headquarters in Seoul
said a special watch was being maintained for members of the ``Gray
Wolves,'' identified as an ultra-rightist Turkish underground group.
   The pope was coming to address the closing of the 44th
International Eucharistic Congress, which has included discussions
about an eventual reunification of North and South Korea.
   The Seoul government is extremely wary about efforts to reunite
the two Koreas, which are technically at war since no peace treaty
was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. On Thursday, a
dissident Presbyterian minister who made a secret trip to North
Korea for reunification talks was sentenced to 10 years in prison
for aiding an enemy power.
   After Seoul, the pope will spend five days touring Indonesia,
the world's largest Moslem country. While the scope of the visit is
to meet with the some of the 5 million Catholics among Indonesia's
175 million people, John Paul is expected to stress the need for
good relations between Moslems and Christians.
   The Indonesian stop, however, has been clouded by a fury over
East Timor.
   Earlier this week, Portuguese President Mario Soares called
Indonesia ``dictatorial'' and accused the government of President
Suharto of persecuting East Timor's Catholic population.
   ``I hope that his Holiness will carry the message he's always
carrying in defense of the oppressed and the victims of
persecution,'' Soares said.
   The Vatican has not recognized the territory's annexation.

   Nightclub comedian Katherine Buckley
makes clear that she's unashamed of being legally deaf. In her act,
she even pokes fun at the hearing device she wears.
   ``Women love it when guys kiss them on their hand, move up to
their shoulder and neck and stick their tongue in the ear,'' she

   Ms. Buckley, who grew up in suburban Cleveland, has become a

   At first she thought people were laughing at her slight speech
impairment, ``but now I can sense that the laughter is sincere.
People really think this stuff is funny.''

   ``Can you imagine 80 hands all going at once?'' she said.

   Independence is paramount to Mikhail
Baryshnikov, who recently quit the American Ballet Theater after
nine years at its helm.
   In the Oct. 8 issue of Parade magazine the Soviet-born dancer
recalls from his childhood ``this absolutely pathological urge to
be independent from everybody.''
   ``I still do want independence,'' he said.
   Baryshnikov, 41, defected when the Bolshoi Ballet visited
Toronto in 1974. He since has expanded his artistic horizons in
movies and on Broadway, and he's become adept at capitalism,
successfully hawking his line of dancewear and introducing a new
perfume.
   Independence also prevails in his personal life.
   Baryshnikov, who remains unmarried, has two children _
8-year-old Alexandra, by actress Jessica Lange, and 3-month-old
Peter, by ballet dancer Lisa Rinehart.
   ``Am I handicapped? A weirdo that I cannot deal with it? Or am I
too selfish?'' he said. ``My idea about the family ... it's not
everybody's idea. My close friends _ that's my family.''

   Veltri said he declined the offer for the fake fur and never was
offered a pinball machine.
   ``The fur is here. It's already dead,'' Veltri said.

from the bandleader himself.
   Sharon Eiseman, secretary-treasurer of Welk Heritage Inc. in
Strasburg, said on Thursday the Lawrence Welk Foundation of Santa
Monica, Calif., sent a $35,000 check two weeks ago.
   Welk Heritage hopes to raise $750,000 for the project. Eiseman

a curator-coordinator and getting construction under way at the old
farmsite three miles northwest of Strasburg.
   Welk Heritage is looking for a local fund-raiser, Eisemann said.
The group had been negotiating with a national fund-raising company.
   Shirley Fredricks, Welk Foundation executive director and Welk's
daughter, said her 86-year-old father is in good health and ``is

Help</HEAD>

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, in a move
that appears to contradict his sworn congressional testimony, urged
an aide to arrange funding for a New York project backed by another
federal official, agency records show.
   Pierce's actions, detailed in Department of Housing and Urban
Development files released Thursday, suggest that at least on this
occasion, Pierce took a more active role than he has acknowledged
in helping those who sought his aid.
   In a handwritten instruction to top aide Deborah Gore Dean,
Pierce asked her to ``check into this and try to get it through.''
   The documents also show that then-Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger wrote Pierce to back a development seeking HUD
financing. On another occasion, records show that Carla Hills,
herself a former HUD secretary and now the Bush administration's
top trade official, got Pierce to overrule deputies in favor of her
clients.
   HUD released more than 20,000 pages from the files of Dean, also
a key figure in investigations of fraud, mismanagement and
influence-peddling at the agency during the Reagan administration.
   Pierce, Dean and her predecessor as his top aide, Lance Wilson,
all have invoked their Fifth Amendment rights and refused to
testify before a House subcommittee investigating the agency.
   The records, released under the Freedom of Information Act,
provide fresh evidence of the considerable power Dean wielded at
HUD and of the persistent lobbying she faced from developers,
consultants, members of Congress and local elected officials.
   The documents concerning the New York project appear to
contradict Pierce's May testimony, in which he said he often was
lobbied by friends and political associates but never assisted them
beyond asking staffers to give the projects ``careful
consideration.''
   The New York project was mentioned in a 1985 handwritten note to
Pierce from the Commerce Department's assistant secretary for
productivity, technology and innovation, urging HUD to back a
proposed project in Manhattan near Columbia University.
   The note to Pierce was signed ``Bruce'' on stationery of the
assistant secretary of commerce. D. Bruce Merrifield, who held that
position at the time, could not be reached in calls to his home or
the company where he is a consultant.
   The 99-unit senior-citizen housing project was granted $1.2
million in rental subsidies, according to Francine Kellman,
spokeswoman for the HUD New York regional office.
   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said he had not seen the
letter to Pierce and was not familiar with the project. But he said
there was ``nothing incriminatory in that situation'' and that
Pierce ``has never asked anyone to deviate from responsible,
professional government standards.''
   On another occasion, documents showed that after a private
research company wrote Pierce to complain that several of its bids
for HUD work had been rejected, the secretary wrote to Dean:
``Let's try to help this fellow. I think he and his company have
been unfairly treated.''
   It could not be immediately determined whether that firm later
got HUD work.
   Weinberger's name surfaced on two September 1983 notes by Pierce
aides discussing a project ``Cap'' had recommended to Pierce. One
aide noted the project was denied funding through normal channels
but ``will be a good candidate for the secretary's discretionary
fund.'' It could not be immediately determined whether the project
was ultimately given HUD money.
   Mrs. Hills appealed to Pierce in 1985 after a California client
trying to sell a HUD-mortgaged development was told it would have
to pay $1.3 million into reserve accounts before the deal could be
approved. Mrs. Hills asked Pierce to reduce the amount to $855,000
and, after Dean endorsed the idea, approved the reduction.
   Some of the documents in Dean's files show:
   _She once rewrote a draft of a Reagan speech the White House had
prepared for the president's appearance with Pierce at an
elementary school. ``Please excuse our crassness,'' she said in a
note to the White House accompanying her revised version.
   _In a handwritten note to Pierce, Ms. Dean said the department's
Office of General Counsel ``can find no document that says you have
ever delegated authority over Mod Rehab to anyone.''
   The Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program was found by the
department's inspector general to have been to be riddled with
political influence; Pierce has said he delegated the power to
award the lucrative subsidies to a three-member committee that
included Dean.
   _Dean was the guest at numerous receptions held by people and
organizations that dealt with HUD, and was guest of honor at a

<HEAD>Soil, Water Conservation Spending at Record Level</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says spending on
soil and water conservation is at a record level because of 1985
legislation that established a long-term retirement program for
fragile cropland.
   Under the massive Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP, a goal
of up to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland could be
taken from production by the end of next year.
   By midyear, more than 30 million acres had been contracted and
more are on the way.
   According to analysts in the department's Economic Research
Service, total spending by USDA and state agencies for conservation
this year could exceed $3.2 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 1988
and $1.2 billion in 1987.
   Estimates show that total USDA spending this year on soil and
water conservation could reach $2.8 billion, up from $2.1 billion
in 1988 and $1.7 billion in 1987.
   Costs of the long-range CRP are expected to account for nearly
$1.75 billion, or roughly 62 percent of the $2.8 billion total,
says economist Merritt Padgitt.
   Other big USDA cost items are $176 million for carrying out
cost-sharing practices under the traditional Agricultural
Conservation Program, which dates back to the 1930s, and $366
million for technical assistance and extension services. A number
of other lesser programs make up the remainder.
   ``Yes, conservation expenditures are at an all-time high,
basically because of the CRP. Otherwise they have been trending
down,'' Padgitt said Thursday. ``The CRP is what has pushed them up
in the past three years.''
   Under the CRP, farmers whose contract offers are accepted can
idle land for 10 years and get annual rental payments from the
government. Those average around $50 per acre per year.
   In return, they must plant grass or trees to protect the land
from erosion. Federal payments also are made to help with the cost
of the initial plantings.
   For 1989, CRP spending is expected to include about $1.2 billion
for rental payments on retired land.
   Besides the total 1989 spending of more than $3.2 billion by
federal, state and local governments on soil and water
conservation, spending by farmers could be approximately $323
million.
   However, Padgitt said that was a tentative figure based on
survey information and could be revised.

   The Agriculture Department is giving Spain
more than 600 plants native to North America to help celebrate the
500th anniversary of the landing of Columbus in the New World.
   Horticulturist Sylvester March of the National Arboretum said
Thursday that the plants will join similar contributions from South
and Central America as part of the 1992 World's Fair in Seville.
The plants will be used in the landscaping and park areas around
the exposition's grounds on La Cartuja Island near Seville.
   March said the 600 specimens are representative of many parts of
North America and were shipped this year to give them time to reach
full development by the exposition's opening in 1992.
   The arboretum's selection ranged from the agave, a hardy
succulent, to the palmetto, he said. All of the plants are suited
to Seville's Mediterranean climate.
   Overall, at least 50,000 trees of more than 200 different
varieties and more than 150,000 bushes and shrubs have been
received for the gardens, according to Spanish officials.
   The island was said to be ``a particularly appropriate site''
for the New World garden because of its historic relationship to
Columbus, who often visited the Carthusian monastery on La Cartuja
to consult its extensive library. The Chapel of Santa Ana at the
monastery was built to house his remains.

   Private exporting companies have reported to
the Agriculture Department an additional sale of 400,000 metric
tons of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union for delivery in 1989-90 under
a long-term supply agreement.
   The corn sale announced Thursday was the third this week to the
Soviet Union, with orders totaling 2.6 million tons of corn and
100,000 tons of soybean meal. The seventh year of the long-term
agreement between the two countries began Oct. 1.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 400,000 tons of
corn would be almost 15.8 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.26 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the
latest sale could have a farm value of about $36 million.

   The debate over the failed coup in Panama
centers on whether the Bush administration showed sensible
restraint. Little is being said about the legal and moral
principles involved.
   No objections were raised on Capitol Hill this week when
Secretary of State James A. Baker III reserved the option of using
force to bring down Gen. Manuel Noriega sometime in the future,
according to ``our own timetable.''
   The conditions cited by Baker were threats to Americans in
Panama or to operations of the Panama Canal. He criticized those
``armchair generals'' in Congress who faulted President Bush for
not supporting the failed insurgency this time around.
   The secretary of state left no doubt the United States could
jump in under more favorable conditions.
   The authors of ``Right v. Might: International Law and the Use
of Force,'' which the Council on Foreign Relations happened to
publish simultaneously with the rebellion in Panama, would argue
the situation differently.
   David J. Scheffer, at a news conference held Thursday with
Panama on everyone's minds, stated the proposition this way:
``Should U.S. military force be used to promote democracy in
Panama?''
   That debate inevitably centers on the United Nations Charter,
specifically article 2(4) which provides: ``All members shall
refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of
force against the territorial integrity or political independence
of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes
of the United Nations.''
   Elsewhere in the charter the exception of self-defense is cited.
   But Louis Henkin, a Columbia University international law
professor, questioned ``the notion that one can decide which
country is illegitimate.''
   And William D. Rogers, a lawyer who was assistant secretary of
state in the Ford administration, registered amazement that in the
current debate ``there has been no reference to the clear, simple,
unqualified prohibition of the use of force'' established in the
U.N. Charter.
   For nearly two years, the Reagan and Bush administrations have
waged an unrelenting propaganda war against Noriega, accusing him
of drug trafficking and dictatorial rule against the wishes of the
Panamanian people.
   Almost daily, U.S. spokesmen declared Noriega must go _ give up
his powers in Panama and, preferably, depart the country. There
were reports even that the Reagan administration considered
kidnapping him to face drug charges by two Florida grand juries.
   The case for U.S. intervention is built on his authoritarian
rule. No one has suggested seriously that the United States is
compelled in self-defense to use force against him _ although Baker
raised the strategic Panama Canal issue.
   Rogers, looking down the road, speculated that at the end of the
century, when the canal goes over to Panama under a 1977 treaty,
the United States would have a clear right to ensure the neutrality
of the waterway.
   ``We can use force to defend the integrity of the Panama Canal
but not to interfere in the political process in Panama,'' the
veteran lawyer said.
   Or, as Rogers wrote in the book: ``The central premise of
article 2(4) is that states should stay out of each other's way.
Thus, strictly interpreted, the Charter rule inhibits ... the right
of one nation to support those seeking to change the way another
nation is governed.''
   In the heyday of imperialism the use of U.S. force as an
instrument of American foreign policy was hardly ever questioned,
except by its targets.
   For a while, the Vietnam wars made U.S. military intervention
unpopular.
   But the Reagan doctrine rejected the idea that American power is
dangerous to the world. As Jeane Kirkpatrick and Allan Gerson write
in Right v. Might:
   ``It is above all concerned with the moral legitimacy of U.S.
support _ including military support _ for insurgencies under
certain circumstances: where there are indigenous opponents to a
government that is maintained by force, rather than popular
consent...''
   A decade earlier, the Brezhnev doctrine established Soviet
justification for intervening in East European countries if their
communist governments were threatened.
   The Reagan doctrine responded by justifying the use of U.S.
force to assist insurgents against governments that suppress
democracy and are, themselves, maintained by force.
   It was all part of a campaign to roll back Marxism.
   The Soviets are not a factor in Panama, but virtually the same
rationale is being invoked by the Bush administration _ and even
more forcefully by its critics who want Noriega out of the way
right now.

   Two bombs exploded late Thursday in
Bogota, injuring two people and damaging a supermarket and a bank,
police said. The attacks were believed to be the latest in a series
by drug traffickers.
   Also Thursday, President Virgilio Barco named new ministers of
justice, interior and communications. His government also announced
plans for referendum to let voters decide whether suspected drug
traffickers wanted in the United States should be extradited.
   A U.S. official in Bogota said that despite the goverment's
unprecedented crackdown on drugs, hundreds of tons of cocaine
continue to be smuggled into the United States.
   Police said citizens captured one man fleeing from the bombings
and turned him over to the authorites. The blasts damaged a
supermarket and bank about 1,200 feet apart, wounding two people,
police said.
   Since Aug. 23, when cocaine chieftains responded to the
government's crackdown by declaring a ``total war'' against it,
traffickers have been blamed for 148 bombings that have killed 10
people and wounded 165.
   The traffickers are trying to get the government to reverse its
stand on extradition.
   The government revived Colombia's extradition treaty with the
United States as part of the emergency measures imposed in a
crackdown on drug lords seven weeks ago.
   Barco's plan for a referendum was announced in a communique
issued by the minister of government, Orlando Vasquez, as one of
his last acts before resigning. Vasquez appeared to be a casualty
of political fighting in Barco's Liberal Party.
   The vote on whether suspected traffickers should be sent to the
United States for trial could come as early as January.
   One suspect has been extradited so far. Proceedings are under
way against another, and two more are being held pending the
arrival of U.S. documents asking for their extradition.
   Barco named Carlos Lemos Simmonds minister of interior, who is
in charge of the nation's police. He replaces Orlando Vasquez
Velasquez, who held the office since July 16. Simmonds was
communications minister and acting minister of justice since Monica
de Greiff resigned last month after death threats by drug
traffickers.
   Barco chose as his new justice minister Roberto Salazar
Manrique, a former treasury official and deputy director of the
national bank.
   The new minister of communications is Enrique Danies Rincones,
ex-governor of Guajira.
   The Cabinet announcements came in a statement by the
presidential press secretary.
   Colombia, with help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, has tried destroying plantations of coca bushes
that are the source for cocaine and destroying laboratories and
chemicals.
   The DEA is now helping Colombian authorities set up a program
aimed at preventing chemicals from reaching traffickers, a U.S.
official said Thursday.
   The program will try to identify companies set up solely for
buying chemicals for cocaine labs, the official said at a briefing
for U.S. reporters. He spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Colombia's cocaine cartels are sending an estimated 3,300 to
4,400 tons of cocaine to the United States each year, the official
said.
   Chemicals used by the drug traffickers are coming mainly from
the United Sates, China, West Germany and the Netherlands, he said,
adding that the DEA will assure that chemicals from the United
States are headed for legitimate companies.
   The official said Colombian companies that import chemicals
often end up unknowingly selling the chemicals to fake companies
set up by cocaine lords.

<HEAD>16 Groups Agree on Religious Holiday Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of religious and education groups
say religious beliefs must not be promoted in public schools with
Halloween and St. Valentine's Day parties or celebrations of
Hanukkah or Christmas.
   Sixteen national organizations released a booklet to help public
schools avoid confusion and tension associated with various
holidays.
   Oliver Thomas of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs
said the ``consensus document'' seeks to ``promote a climate of
cooperation between school boards, administrators, parents and
teachers in school districts throughout the country.''
   The guidelines, Thomas said, ``are constitutionally permissible
and educationally sound. The approach we take is academic _ not
devotional.''
   Charles Haynes of Americans United Research Foundation estimated
there are at least 2,000 Christian denominations and another 1,000
or so non-Christian groups.
   School districts are urged to follow several steps to respect
religious liberty and advance education, including developing
policies about the treatment of religious holidays in the curricula
and informing parents of those policies.
   While the booklet reviews court rulings on the issue, Oliver
said he and several other coalition members disagree with a recent
ruling that Christmas trees aren't a religious symbol. He said the
coalition ``would encourage the same type of sensitivity on the
part of schools in regard to Christmas trees as with any other
religious symbols.''
   ``The `season to be jolly' is a difficult one for Jews and other
non-Christians,'' said Stephen Kurzman of the American Jewish
Committee.
   ``In our public schools, young children and their teachers must
frequently make the difficult choice between participating in
activities that are alien to their family beliefs or separating
themselves from friends and festivities.''
   The booklet says that while many people consider Halloween and
Valentine's Day secular holidays, others view them as having
religious overtones.
   It says schools often excuse students who object to
participating in specific events but that such a policy ``cannot be
used as a rationale for school sponsorship of religious celebration
or worship for the remaining students.''
   Elliott Wright of the National Conference of Christians and Jews
Inc. applauded the idea of ``treating various religious holidays as
occasions for historical and cultural instruction.''
   Gary Marx said the American Association of School Administrators
``stands firmly behind the separation of church and state,'' but
added that the discussions have been healthy.
   ``The bottom line must always be that the public schools will,
in no way, use these holidays to promote one religious belief over
another,'' said Marx, the association's associate executive
director.
   Other participating organizations are the American Academy of
Religion, American Federation of Teachers, American Jewish Congress
and the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development,
Christian Legal Society and National Association of Evangelicals.
   Also, the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA,
National Council on Religion and Public Education, National Council
for the Social Studies, National Education Association and the
National School Boards Association.
   Officials said the Catholic Conference participated in drafting
the document but didn't want to be included as an official sponsor.
They said the Islamic Society of North America has asked to be
included as a sponsor.

   Religious broadcasters reaped a bitter harvest
of lost credibility, contributions and congregation sown by the
lapses of Jim Bakker and other big-time apostles of the airwaves.
   But even as Judgment Day fell Thursday for a fallen Bakker,
electronic evangelism beamed resiliency amid the spatter of scandal.
   ``TV evangelism is not dead. It's damaged, and it's changed
permanently,'' said religious historian David Harrell of the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. ``But there clearly is an
audience buying the product these people are selling, which is
ministering to lonely, alienated people.
   ``Because some of these great men had warts, it's not going to
cause the faithful to lose their faith.''
   Jimmy Swaggart lost 69 percent of his viewership and 72 percent
of the enrollment at his Bible college after revelations in 1988
that he paid a prostitute to pose naked and talk dirty.
   Faith healer Oral Roberts, burdened with a $25 million debt, is
closing his City of Faith Hospital and medical school in Tulsa,
Okla. Two years ago, before scandals raised skepticism, Roberts
told his flock that a 900-foot-tall Jesus had appeared in a vision
and God would ``call me home'' if believers didn't send in $8
million. He got the money.
   Jerry Falwell raised more money than ever this year, thanks to
brisk sales of cassette tapes for home Bible study. But the Moral
Majority founder, who dismantled that conservative political arm in
August, has dropped from the top 10 televangelists in TV ratings
because of a 52 percent slip in viewership.
   Pat Robertson, the failed Republican presidential candidate,
returned to ``The 700 Club'' last year after revenues fell by
one-third. He has recovered his losses, and contributions are near
their 1986 peak of $139 million, according to spokesmen at his
Christian Broadcasting Network.
   ``The fallout has affected everyone in religious broadcasting to
some degree, but God is still on the throne,'' said Robert Cook,
executive director of the 1,300-member National Religious
Broadcasters, an umbrella group for the $2-billion-a-year industry.
   Earlier this year, the Internal Revenue Service began auditing
23 TV ministries and said tax exemptions for some could be in
jeopardy.
   Even before the IRS action, the NRB expelled Swaggart and
tightened its rules, insisting each member make public yearly
audits of donations and spending.
   The NRB says that at the local level, the electronic church is
flourishing, with the number of Christian TV stations growing more
than 50 percent to 336 in three years and the number of radio
stations increasing 8 percent to 1,485.
   But overall credibility suffered because of Bakker's and
Swaggart's misdeeds.
   Shortly after the scandals, only 23 percent of Americans said TV
evangelists could be trusted with money, a Gallup poll showed. In a
New York Times-CBS News Poll, 75 percent of regular viewers of TV
evangelists thought they were too concerned with money, and
one-third of the contributors had an unfavorable opinion of TV
ministries.
   ``People don't want to write blank checks anymore,'' said
Richard Yao of Fundamentalists Anonymous, a New York watchdog group
founded in 1985 by people who had quit evangelical churches.
   In 1987, the group inducted Swaggart into its Hall of Infamy as
a ``a one-man horror show,'' derided Roberts for ``spiritual
extortion,'' described Falwell as an ``overexposed and fading
star,'' and called Robertson ``the reverend who would be king.''
   The newest inductee will be Bakker, whom Yao called ``one of the
biggest con men of the century.''
   Bakker, 49, was convicted Thursday of wire fraud, mail fraud and
conspiracy for diverting more than $3.7 million in PTL money to
support a lavish lifestyle.
   His downfall began with his 1987 confession to having had a
sexual tryst with New York church secretary Jessica Hahn. He
allegedly tried to buy her silence with $265,000; she later bared
her soul and her body for $1 million in Playboy magazine.
   Penthouse featured prostitute Debra Murphree recreating the
poses she said Swaggart paid her to do in motels.
   Swaggart tearfully confessed in 1988 to ``moral failure.''
Defrocked by the Assemblies of God and ordered to stay away from
television for a year, he instead took a three-month TV break _ and
saw his audience nose-dive from 2 million households to 923,000,
according to Arbitron, the TV rating service. This year, he is seen
in 628,000 households.
   Falwell's revenues this year were $135 million, up $47 million
from the previous year, because of cassette sales and other non-TV
revenue. Falwell took over PTL from Bakker but failed to keep it
out of bankruptcy court.
   ``It was our greatest growth ever,'' Falwell spokesman Mark
DeMoss said of the favorable revenues. ``We finally feel far
removed from the situation we found ourselves in the middle of two
years ago.''
   Robertson also has rebounded. Ratings are up 18 percent since
Robertson returned to ``The 700 Club'' 15 months ago. He also is
building a $21 million conference center in Virginia Beach, Va.
   ``It was a chastening thing, a cleansing thing,'' spokesman
David Hummel said of the scandals. ``We've weathered the storm.''

<HEAD>Senate Plans Weekend Session on Deficit Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House passage of an $11 billion
deficit-cutting bill shifts the spotlight to the Senate, where
lawmakers are preparing to work through the weekend and next week's
recess on the politically prickly measure.
   On a 333-91 vote, the House approved the legislation Thursday
after nearly two weeks of clamorous debate that saw the leaders of
the majority Democrats take a series of embarrassing tumbles.
   Chief among them was the adoption of a capital gains reduction
coveted by President Bush, and rejection of a Democratic plan to
raise taxes on the wealthy while restoring some Individual
Retirement Account benefits.
   ``My gosh, how many more wins can we have in a one-week or
two-week period of time?'' House Republican Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois asked reporters.
   On final passage, 187 Democrats and 146 Republicans voted for
approval while 63 Democrats and 28 Republicans were opposed.
   Senate leaders hoped to finish their own version of the bill by
Sunday night.
   The measure is the keystone of congressional efforts to reduce
the projected deficit for fiscal 1990, which began Sunday, to no
more than $110 billion. Current projections for this year's
shortfall are about $116 billion, not counting the
deficit-reduction bill.
   The measure has been criticized for containing phony savings,
such as not counting next year's anticipated Postal Service losses
of nearly $2 billion for budget purposes.
   If the legislation isn't enacted by Oct. 16, the Gramm-Rudman
balanced budget law will trigger automatic spending cuts on defense
and many domestic programs, averaging about 5 percent of their
budgets.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CAPITAL GAINS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on profits from
selling capital assets such as real estate and stocks.
   The current 33 percent top rate would be reduced to 19.6 percent
through the end of 1991. The rate would then be raised to 28
percent and the basis of assets ``indexed'' so profit caused
entirely by inflation wouldn't be taxed.
   The change is expected to bring the Treasury $2.9 billion in
fiscal 1990, $3.8 billion in fiscal 1991 and $2.7 billion in fiscal
1992 as people take advantage of the lower rate and increase their
capital activity.
   After the initial increase, the government's intake would drop
sharply with losses of more than $5 billion projected for fiscal
1993 and 1994.

   The bill expands the Head Start program for preschool children

   It would provide an additional $16 billion in tax credits and
state-administered grants to lower-income families over five years
to help improve child care for working parents.
   It would liberalize the earned-income credit, which benefits
lower-income working families with children. The credit could range
up to $1,790 a year for those with three or more children. A new
credit of up to $430 a year would help families with children under
the age of 6.

   The bill includes about $6.3 billion in net revenue increase for

   Significant among the others are repeal of the
completed-contract method of accounting, by which big defense
contractors may defer taxes; elimination of special tax benefits
for banks that lend money to Employee Stock Ownership Plans; and an
end to an interest break on big banks' large loans to developing
countries.
   The bill would require companies to move quickly to give the
government the payroll taxes they withhold from employees, and
repeal a 1986 tax law provision, known as Section 89, aimed at
ensuring that employer-financed health plans don't discriminate in
favor of higher-paid employees.
   It would extend the 25 percent deduction for health insurance
premiums paid by self-employed workers, which was due to expire
this year. That extension was tied a measure to restrict refunds of
interest deductions related to leveraged buy-outs.

<HEAD>Chemical-Food Hauls by Truckers Worry Food Processors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of an association of food processors
say they are worried about the practice of alternating loads of
chemicals and food in the same tank truck.
   Truckers told a House Public Works and Transportation
subcommittee at a Thursday hearing that they alternated loads of
chemicals with shipments of juice, wine and edible oils.
   The practice, while legal, is worrisome, said Allen Matthys of
the National Food Processors Association, which represents more
than 600 food companies and industry suppliers.
   ``While neither the Food and Drug Administration nor our members
have yet discovered a case of contamination caused by this
practice, we strongly encourage the swift enactment of specific
federal guidelines or legislation to prevent the contamination of
food by hazardous non-food materials,'' Matthys said in prepared
testimony.
   He told the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight that
some association members have been asking carriers for written
guarantees that tanker trucks are used only for food.
   Two months ago, the subcommittee was told by several truckers
that they sometimes carried garbage in the same refrigerated trucks
used for food.
   The panel focused Thursday on the related practice of hauling
chemicals and liquid foods back to back.
   Trucker David Helzer of Hermiston, Ore., said the practice
appeared widespread. He has worked for two Washington State
trucking companies.
   ``On June 9, 1988, I loaded ammonium phosphate, washed out, and
reloaded apple juice. I then loaded monethanolamine 100 percent,
washed out, and reloaded apple juice,'' Helzer said.
   Helzer's 1989 shipment log, released by the panel, included
loads of cooking oil, wine, apple juice, fire retardant, marine
lubricant and lime sulphur.
   ``The backhauling of chemicals is dangerous, disgusting and
unfortunately legal,'' said committee member William Clinger, R-Pa.
``We need to make it a crime.''
   Clifford J. Harvison, president of the National Truck Carriers
Inc., said he had not heard about any health-related problems
associated with carrying alternate loads of chemicals and food. The
trade group represents more than 200 trucking companies
specializing in carrying bulk commodities.
   Harvison said in a prepared statement that responsible carriers
always clean the tanks between loads, and many of the chemicals
being transported are intended for use in food or health-care
products.
   ``Simply stated, no responsible carrier manager who cares
anything for his or her corporate equity or personal integrity
would knowingly commingle non-compatible chemicals with products
destined for human use or consumption,'' Harvison said.
   Food manufacturers, he said, have the option of rejecting dirty
tankers.
   But Mathys said it was difficult for food processors to test for
contaminants because ``they must know what it is they are testing
for.''
   Truckers Jim and Rikki Pomerenke of Yakima, Wash., testified
that carrying back-to-back loads of chemicals and juice bothered
them so much that they refused to haul a load of chemicals from
Illinois to the West Coast in May, and were fired by the Premium
Transport Co. of Yakima.
   The subcommittee said Premium is owned by James Ketchum, who
declined a reporter's request for a telephone interview Thursday.
Ketchum also declined an invitation by the panel to testify.

<HEAD>Government Awards $9 Million for Expanded AIDS Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is ``reaching out'' to
women, minorities and drug users infected with AIDS by giving $9
million to community-based research programs in 14 cities,
officials say.
   The money will go to 18 programs that serve about 30,000 people
with AIDS. About a third of that number are black or Hispanic, 21
percent are intravenous drug users and 8 percent are women.
   ``The message is we're reaching out,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci,
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, which is distributing the funds.
   ``We're attempting to make available and accessible to the
community kinds of topnotch clinical research that has been
classically limited to the major medical centers.''
   Researchers say women, minorities and intravenous drug users are
under-represented in AIDS drug trials, largely because the research
is conducted at academic medical centers while most AIDS patients
get care from doctors in their own communities.
   Thursday's announcement of the programs selected for funding was
criticized by a losing applicant _ the Community Research
Initiative in New York, a pioneer of community-based AIDS research.
   CRI was the model for many of the more than two dozen
community-based research programs conducting clinical trials on
AIDS drugs. Most of the testing is sponsored by drug manufacturers.
   Those programs have helped move AIDS drug testing from the large
academic research centers into communities, where local physicians
and their AIDS patients can participate.
   CRI officials said they had not been told why they had been
excluded, but said it may have been a punishment for past
criticisms of federal research efforts.
   Fauci said the awards were decided by a panel of community
doctors, nurses, social workers, researchers and people infected
with the virus.
   The reviewers evaluated and ranked the proposals. The institute
then funded each in the order they appeared until the $9 million
was exhausted, Fauci said.
   He said that he could not, by law, discuss the merits of any
applicants, but that institute officials would discuss CRI's
application with CRI officials privately.
   However, Fauci did reject CRI's contention that past criticism
of federal research may have been a factor.
   ``I'm sorry CRI wasn't funded. I would have liked for them to
have been,'' Fauci said, adding there were more qualified programs
than there was available funding.
   ``The process I saw was rigorous and equitable,'' said reviewer
Jean McGuire of the AIDS Action Council.
   The programs selected include 11 with limited clinical
experience and seven that are capable of or have been conducting
clinical trials. They will receive from $278,000 to $800,000 for
the first year of a five-year contract.
   The programs with limited clinical experience are:
   Addiction Research and Treatment Corp. in Brooklyn, N.Y.;
Atlanta AIDS Research Consortium; Chicago Community Program for
Clinical Research on AIDS; Clinical Directors Network of Region II
in the Bronx and Brooklyn, N.Y., and Newark, N.J.; Comprehensive
AIDS Alliance of Detroit;
   Delaware Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS,
Dover, Del.; Harlem AIDS Treatment Group in New York; Hill Health
Center in New Haven, Conn.; Louisiana Community Program for
Clinical Research on AIDS in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, La.;
North Jersey AIDS Alliance in Newark, N.J.; and Phoenix Shanti
Group of Phoenix, Ariz.
   The programs with some clinical experience are:
   Bronx Lebanon Hospital in the Bronx, N.Y.; Denver Community
Program for Clinical Research on AIDS; Henry Ford Hospital in
Detroit; Research and Education Group, the Oregon AIDS Task Force
in Portland, Ore.; Richmond AIDS Consortium in Richmond, Va.; San
Francisco County Community Consortium; and the Veterans
Administration Center in Washington, D.C.

   A train carrying hundreds of East
German refugees rolled across their homeland to the West today, a
day after a similar exodus was disrupted by thousands trying to
board the freedom trains.
   Authorities said a train carrying the 633 refugees, some
chanting ``Deutschland!'' pulled out of a train station in Warsaw,
Poland, late Thursday on a journey through Poland and East Germany
to West Germany.
   Those aboard had crowded West Germany's embassy in Warsaw in
hopes of joining more than 46,000 East Germans who have made their
way through Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland since mid-September.
   West German radio and television reported early today that more
East Germans had entered the embassy in Warsaw. ``The number at the
embassy is not yet known,'' the radio reported.
   The ZDF television said the would-be emigres ``heard the train
had left, and are also hoping to emigrate.''
   The journey comes as East Germany, deeply embarrassed by the
exodus, begins two days of celebrations marking the communist
country's 40th anniversary.
   Among those flying in to attend the festivities is Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is expected to ask East
Germany's aging hard-line leaders how they plan to handle the
westward flight that is draining much of the East Germany's work
force.
   Poland contributed two extra cars to a six-car East German train
sent to carry the refugees to West Germany, which grants them
automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives.
   The train left Gdansk Station in northern Warsaw Thursday
evening, and West German railway officials said the train had
crossed into East Germany by early today.
   Freedom trains that left Czechoslovakia brought 7,600 East
Germans to the West Thursday after a trip plagued by delays and
disrupted by a riot in Dresden, East Germany, witnesses said.
   West German officials have not said whether they overestimated
how many East Germans would join the exodus from Czechoslovakia's
capital of Prague, having initially cited a possible figure of
10,000 to 11,000.
   In Prague, 200 East Germans left the West German Embassy late
Thursday and headed home with promises from their government of
legal emigration within months. Sources said about 10 East Germans
still were inside the mission.
   Czechoslovak police used riot police to seal off the embassy
from more East Germans. East Germany restricted travel to
Czechoslovakia earlier this week.
   There was sympathy among Czechoslovaks for the East German
refugees. The hard-line Prague government has also refused
democratic reform.
   ``Of course they are running away,'' a 40-year-old Czechoslovak
said on condition of anonymity. ``They want freedom.
   ``I am sure this will have some impact on our country ... but it
will take some time because our leadership is very conservative.''
   East Germans began making their way west through Hungary in May
when that communist country removed obstacles from its border with
Austria. Since Hungary officially opened its borders Sept. 10,
about 32,000 East Germans have used that route to West Germany.
   About 7,000 more East Germans arrived in West Germany last
weekend from Warsaw and Prague, where they had taken refuge in West
German embassies.
   Police in Dresden reportedly used clubs and water cannons to
drive crowds back from the main railroad station during the exodus
from Czechoslovakia.
   ``It was a horrible scene,'' said a woman in Dresden who asked
not to be identified because she feared reprisals. ``People were
trying desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks, but the
police forced them back.''
   Refugees said the first train stopped outside Dresden for hours.
At least three others were diverted around the city. Protesters
hurled stones at police and at the Dresden station, smashing
windows, witnesses reported. They said thousands took part.
   Masses of regular police, secret police and workers' groups
organized by the Communist Party dispersed the crowds and sealed
off the stations.
   East Germany insisted the trains pass through its territory,
rather than crossing into West Germany from Czechoslovakia, so it
could formally declare the refugees expelled.

<HEAD>Showdown Likely Over Children TV Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress may be heading for another showdown
with the White House on restricting advertising on children's
television shows.
   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on
Thursday approved on a voice vote a bill that would limit ads on
shows aimed at children to 10{ minutes per hour on weekends and 12
minutes per hour weekdays.
   The bill also would condition a broadcaster's license renewal on
whether the station provided programs aimed at educating youngsters.
   President Bush hasn't said what he'll do if such legislation
reaches his desk, but the Justice Department is recommending he
veto it on grounds it unconstitutionally intrudes on TV program
content.
   The bill was a compromise between a television
industry-supported measure by Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and
Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., that passed Congress last year but was
vetoed by President Reagan, and a tougher measure proposed this
year by Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo.
   Introducing his bill, Metzenbaum cited a dramatic increase in
the amount of advertising on children's shows since the Federal
Communications Commission repealed ad limits in 1984. He said some
programs urge young viewers to dial 900 telephone numbers to hear
taped messages from cartoon characters.
   The House has passed the Metzenbaum version.
   After the bill was approved Thursday, Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, persuaded the committee not to send it to the Senate for
30 days.
   Inouye, who has bitterly attacked what he calls ``rubbish'' on
television, said he wanted to consult broadcasters and consider
further changes in the bill.
   Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., agreed to a request
by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., that the committee consider extending
the bill's restrictions to cable television.
   Inouye said studies have shown that youngsters, on average,
watch between three hours and five hours of TV a day, while
spending less than an hour on homework. Young children lack the
ability to distinguish between commercials and programs, and
working parents often can't supervise what their children watch,
Inouye said.
   The Senate bill also would require the FCC to be more responsive
to complaints about so-called program-length commercials that
feature toys.
   This bill, Inouye said, ``is the least we owe our children.''
   Until 1984, the FCC had limited commercials on children's
programs to 9{ minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays.
Wirth's bill would have reimposed those standards.
   Wirth's bill also would have reclassified program-length
commercials as advertisements, thereby effectively eliminating them.
   In other action Thursday, the committee, on voice votes:
   _Approved a bill to require broadcasters to provide the lowest
possible rates to political candidates and make the ads
non-pre-emptible.
   _Authorized FCC spending of $109.8 million for fiscal 1990 and
$117.8 million for fiscal 1991.

troops ``would be prepared to block access by road'' to the
headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces. They also wanted
sanctuary for the family of a coup leader.

the rebels said they needed to prevent Noriega from bringing in
loyalist relief units.

   Ben Johnson, the world-class sprinter knocked
off track and field's pedestal after testing positive for steroids,
says it's wrong for athletes to use the muscle-building substance.
   ``I got caught in Seoul. I lost my gold medal,'' the Canadian
told reporters as legislation to classify anabolic steroids as a
controlled substance was introduced Thursday.
   ``I'm here to tell the people of this country it's wrong to
cheat, not to take it, it's bad for your health.''
   Watching Johnson was his chief nemesis: Carl Lewis, the man who
was awarded the Olympic gold medals Johnson lost.
   ``I think it's great,'' Lewis said of the legislation. ``They're
making a move and it's very positive. I'm happy to see it.''
   However, the flamboyant, pony-tailed Lewis told reporters: ``I
don't understand why Ben Johnson's here.''
   Lewis said he attended the news conference because he was
working on his autobiography and one of the chapters deals with
steroids. He said he didn't intend to upstage Johnson.
   Reps. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and Benjamin
Gilman, R-N.Y., invited Johnson to attend as they presented the
legislation that would make anabolic steroids a controlled
substance, similar to the designation given cocaine and heroin.
   The lawmakers emphasized the increasing abuse of steroids by
college, high school and even junior high school athletes who
believe the substance will enhance their performance.
   ``America is about to have an adolescent time-bomb explode in
its hands,'' Levine said. ``But if we act quickly enough to
restrict steroid distribution, and to increase the penalties for
illicit distribution, we can prevent this plague from spreading.''
   Levine referred to the abuse of steroids as ``the silent side of
the drug disease in this country.'' He applauded Johnson's courage
for attending the news conference.
   Johnson later stepped up to the microphones and in a quiet voice
with a slight stutter told other athletes not to make the same
mistake he did, urging them ``to come forward, to come clean.''
   Lewis dismissed reporters' questions that he had used steroids,
indicating he would be willing to run against Johnson ``if he comes
back and he's clean.''
   While Lewis held the spotlight, Johnson slipped away to
adjoining congressional offices.
   ``He's not here to compete with Carl Lewis. I hope he will
someday,'' said Ed Futerman, Johnson's lawyer.

<HEAD>Quebec Election Puts Pressure Back on Constitutional Agreement</HEAD>
<NOTE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>QUEBEC (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for quick resolution of a constitutional
standoff are fading after the provincial election that confirmed
the separatist Parti Quebecois as Quebec's second-ranking political
force.
   All 10 Canadian provinces must ratify an accord by next June
that would allow Quebec to endorse the federal constitution by
recognizing Canada's only majority French-speaking province as a
``distinct society'' within the country.
   New Brunswick and Manitoba, arguing that the agreement would
weaken the federal government, so far have refused to sign.
Newfoundland also has threatened to withdraw its support from the
accord, known as the Meech Lake Agreement.
   Speculation before Quebec's Sept. 25 election had been that a
smashing victory for the Liberal Party led by Premier Robert
Bourassa would allow him maneuvering room that might lead to a
compromise on the constitutional agreement.
   Bourassa won his second consecutive majority government, but the
Parti Quebecois, urging eventual independence for the province,
slightly improved its showing from the last provincial election in
1985.
   The party captured 40.2 percent of the vote _ up from 38.6
percent four years earlier _ surprising analysts who had predicted
its demise.
   The Liberals, hurt by defections to a new party of
English-speaking voters irate about provincial language policies,
slipped from 56 percent to 49.9 percent, although they still hold
92 of the 125 seats in the provincial assembly.
   The Liberals argue that any change in the constitutional
agreement, reached by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 10
provincial premiers in 1987, would kill the plan and further kindle
Quebec separatism.
   The Meech Lake Agreement was seen as a way for Quebec, whose
population is 81 percent French-speaking, to get around its
objections to signing a national constitution earlier in the decade.
   Canadian independence dates to 1867, but British jurisdiction
over the constitution did not formally end until April 17, 1982,
when Queen Elizabeth II proclaimed the new Constitution Act.
   Quebec's assembly was the first to ratify the agreement on a
``distinct society'' for the province. Seven other provincial
legislatures followed, as did Parliament on June 22, 1988, but the
two holdout provinces are needed for it to take effect.
   Opponents of the accord charge that recognizing a distinct
society within Canada would weaken the federal Charter of Rights
and that provinces would be given too much power. In addition, the
English-speaking provinces traditionally have been wary of Quebec.
   The federal constitution applies to Quebec even though it has
not signed the document, but the refusal makes it more difficult
for changes to be made on such national issues as native rights and
the way the Senate operates.
   Bourassa's statements since the provincial election have implied
that those who supported his party did so with the expectation that
it would lead to Quebec's recognition as a ``distinct society,''
and voters could support separatism if the Meech Lake Agreement is
killed.
   ``The facts are there to be read,'' he said, adding that 40
percent of the voters ``have supported a party whose main plank is
independence for Quebec.''
   Other provinces argue that Quebec's election was fought largely
over local issues unrelated to separatism and the Parti Quebecois
might not fare so well in a referendum held solely on independence.

<HEAD>Skinner Would Allow Foreign Carriers Exclusive Routes to Some US
Cities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department is proposing
that foreign airlines be given exclusive rights to fly between
their home countries and some U.S. cities that have little or no
international air service.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Thursday that he
will explore the possibility of opening more U.S. cities to flights
by foreign airlines without the usual bilateral negotiations.
   If the plan is adopted, Skinner said, ``many more U.S. cities
will have the opportunity to enjoy the economic benefits'' of
direct international flights.
   In a speech at a forum on international aviation, Skinner said
the department would propose the new rules within a few days. A
period for public comment, usually about two months, would follow
before the rules would take effect.
   Skinner did not detail what cities or routes might be affected.
   He said the department had been flooded with letters from
governors, members of Congress, mayors and business leaders urging
a policy that would open up more international routes from cities
where passengers have to make connecting flights to go abroad.
   Permission for foreign airlines to fly the routes would be
dependent upon having a pro-competitive agreement that would allow
U.S. carriers ``all the rights our airlines require'' within the
country where the foreign carrier is based, Skinner said.
   International routes generally are awarded through bilateral
negotiations between the United States and other countries.
   Under the proposal, the United States would approve foreign
service between a U.S. city and the carrier's home country only if
no other airline served the route, if the United States has no
aviation dispute pending with the country and if no U.S. airline or
other party raises any ``overriding public interest objection.''
   ``We stand ready to share our free market competitive concept
with any country willing to listen,'' Skinner said.
   The proposal, he said, would not replace traditional aviation
negotiations. But Skinner said that had not worked in cases where
U.S. carriers have no immediate plans to service a route that a
foreign carrier is willing to fly or where no additional foreign
government permission is needed.

<HEAD>Hills Says Chemical Rumors Could Fuel Trade Dispute of the Decade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills says the
trade controversy of the 1990s could be import barriers caused by
unverified rumors about products tainted by chemicals.
   ``For nations ... to simply allege that the way you're raising
your beef (endangers consumers) or there may be some problem with
your grapefruit, without testing it, is just a guise for
restricting trade,'' she said.
   The United States will try to negotiate rules for reputable
international testing at the coming round of global trade talks in
Geneva, Mrs. Hills said during a preview this week of a planned
journey to South Korea and Japan.
   ``We simply must rely upon scientific data and medical data to
support the allegations that a product is harmful, and if it is not
harmful there ought to be no barrier whatsoever,'' she told the
gathering of mostly Asian reporters.
   ``If we don't get discipline in this area, I think this will be
the trade controversy of the '90s. It will be very unpleasant
because it will be based upon misinformation, it will fan public
passion and it will be enormously unfair.''
   The United States, the world's major exporter of agricultural
products, is particularly sensitive to the market impact of
unverified claims about food contamination.
   Mrs. Hills, who leaves Saturday for Seoul, said she expected the
South Korean government ``to prevent vandalism ... and
misinformation'' she says has been used there against U.S. products.
   She said continuing boycotts of U.S. grapefruit and other
products in South Korea were ``outrageous,'' saying they were
triggered by rumors about the use of harmful chemicals such as alar.
   The alar report was ``pure myth and fiction ... in our view a
means of preventing the sale of grapefruit in Korea,'' Mrs. Hills
said.
   She said it was on the same level as a tactic of putting snakes
in a theater to prevent distribution of U.S. films in Korea last
year.
   Her reference to beef recalled last year's trade conflict over
Western Europe's ban on U.S. meat produced using a growth hormone
favored by American livestock producers. The U.S. government
sharply disputed European claims that the hormone left a harmful
residue and for a time ordered retaliatory tariffs against European
products.
   The dispute ended after U.S. packing houses recaptured markets
by exporting meat from animals not treated with the hormone.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Amendment to Ban Flag Burning, Rejects Senate Version</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, saying a Senate-approved
statutory ban on defacing the American flag is inadequate, is
renewing his support for a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag
burning.
   ``I believe that a constitutional amendment, properly drawn, is
necessary in order to provide the proper protection,'' Bush said
Thursday after 91-9 approval by the Senate of the statutory ban.
   The House-passed measure now returns there for consideration of
changes made by the Senate. It calls for up to a $1,000 fine and a
year in jail for burning or otherwise defacing the flag.
   A constitutional amendment to ban flag burning is set to come up
in the Senate on Oct. 16; the House also is expected to take up
such a measure.
   Republican senators kept up pressure for a constitutional
amendment as the only effective counter to a June Supreme Court
decision that threw out the conviction of Texas flag-burner Gregory
Lee Johnson on free-speech grounds.
   They scoffed at the notion that the Democratic-sponsored bill
would meet the high court's test of constitutionality.
   Democrats countered that free speech guaranteed by the
Constitution should be limited only as a last resort. They claimed
to have carefully worded their bill to protect it against an
expected new court challenge on free-speech grounds.
   Bush was among those saying the bill didn't go far enough.
   ``I respect the intention of those who voted for (a statutory
ban),'' Bush told reporters. ``But I continue to believe such an
approach is inadequate in light of the Supreme Court decision.''
   Before passage, the Senate voted 53-47 to table, or kill, an
amendment offered by Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., to apply the
defacement ban only to those who acted in public.
   It added an amendment from Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., that
would make it illegal to ``physically defile'' the flag.
   ``The Dole amendment was the potential killer amendment,'' Sen.
Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said
afterward.
   Biden had told the Senate the Dole and Wilson amendments would
skew the language and push the bill closer toward the danger zone
in which a court could find that it limited free speech.
   Biden said after the Senate acted, however, there was not much
to fear from the Wilson amendment.
   ``Wilson's OK,'' he said. ``I just didn't want a trend to start
and that's why I opposed it. My expectation is that the House will
accept our changes and I think they may act fairly quickly.''
   House Democratic leaders tried Thursday afternoon to bring the
bill to the floor for final action, but Republicans succeeded in
blocking that move.
   Biden said it was too early to forecast the prospects for the
proposed constitutional amendment in the Senate. ``It'll be
tight,'' he said.
   It was clear that some lawmakers hoped support for the bill
would insulate them from charges on the campaign trail next year
that they failed to support the constitutional amendment. A number
of lawmakers indicated that they would vote for both the bill and
the amendment.
   Burning the flag already is outlawed under federal law, but few
believe that statute could withstand a court test such as the one
in the Texas case.
   Democratic sponsors sought to design a bill that would ban any
act of defacement, regardless of whether it involved political
protest. That way, they said, there would be no danger of it being
held unconstitutional.
   Those voting against the measure were Sens. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.;
Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.; Dole; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Charles
Grassley, R-Iowa; John H. Chafee, R-R.I.; and Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.

<HEAD>Airborne Drug Plan Shot Down in Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A measure to allow airborne federal agents to
fire on cocaine-carrying aircraft has been rejected in the Senate,
with lawmakers expressing concern that the plan's safety features
might be unworkable.
   ``Let's not go into a piranha-like feeding frenzy every time
somebody mentions drugs,'' Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, said Thursday.
``Let's send it back where it came from before we kill some
innocent people out there.''
   Reversing an action it took only weeks ago, the Senate voted
52-48 to kill the measure that sponsors had sought to add to a
wide-ranging drug bill.
   The Senate then peppered the drug bill with more than a score of
mostly minor amendments and unanimously approved it. The measure
now goes to the House.
   Glenn, a former combat pilot and astronaut who still flies
civilian planes, scoffed at claims that the safeguards built into
the measure would protect innocent aviators who might be mistaken
for drug smugglers.
   He said the safeguards were guaranteed to fail because they
didn't take into consideration what frequencies would be used for
radio warnings and how pilots flying at night would see visual
warnings.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., also a pilot, said he would be
uncomfortable about another plane getting close enough to his
airplane so that it could send him visual signals because it might
``bump into me.''
   Supporters said such a measure was needed to combat cocaine
being flown into the United States from South America.
   Only a few weeks ago, the Senate attached a similar measure to a
Defense Department authorization bill now in a House-Senate
conference committee.
   The sponsor, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added a number of
safeguards to the new version after critics complained about the
danger of shooting down an innocent pilot.
   ``There's virtually no chance that the dentist from Peoria is
going to get shot out of the air,'' McConnell said.
   In other action on the bill, the Senate restored a provision
that would require parolees to pass a drug test before their
release.
   As initially offered, the bill would have required such tests of
not only parolees but also those arrested, jailed and placed on
probation. But the Senate struck out that provision in favor of a
pilot program under which the Justice Department will study what
kind of testing works best.
   The Senate also attached a provision that would create 20 new
federal judges. The Judiciary Committee would determine exactly
where the new positions would be allocated.
   Under an agreement between lawmakers, the committee also will
produce legislation to create an unspecified number of additional
judgeships.
   Other provisions would:
   _Require the Department of Health and Human Services to
establish programs of ``aftercare'' for patients who have completed
treatment programs, expanded services for women and minorities and
stopgap assistance for addicts waiting to get into treatment
programs.
   _Provide incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop
anti-addiction drugs.
   _Raise the minimum mandatory federal penalty for selling
narcotics to minors from five years in prison to 10 years.
   _Allow the government to seek fines of $100,000 in civil suits
against crack house operators.

<TEXT>
   Evangelists say they're eager to get on with God's work now that
TV preacher Jim Bakker has been convicted of fraud.
   ``This verdict doesn't bother the work of the Lord; the work of
the church continues to go on no matter what happens,'' said the
Rev. Billy Graham. ``God's work is not dependent upon one person _
it is dependent upon the Holy Spirit.
   Bakker was convicted Thursday in Charlotte, N.C., of bilking his
followers in the promotion of his Heritage USA religious retreat
and theme park near Fort Mill, S.C. Prosecutors said Bakker
diverted $3.7 million of ministry money to pay for his lavish
lifestyle. He faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and
$5 million in fines.
   ``There are still countless thousands of men and women in the
ministry _ serving as pastors, teachers, missionaries and
evangelists _ being faithful to what God has called them to do,
many of them on very low incomes,'' said Graham.
   The Rev. Robert Schuller, a TV evangelist who preaches from the
Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif., said: ``Now that the
jury has reached a verdict I am optimistic because Americans will
know that it is safe to trust in trust again.
   ``I'm thankful that this sad, sorry, pathetic story has come to
an end. I think a lot of people will realize how easy good people
with good intentions can get off track.''
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell said evangelists can get on with
spreading God's word now that Bakker has been convicted.
   ``While I am personally sorry for Mr. Bakker, his family, and
the thousands who have been hurt by the PTL saga, I am pleased that
this dark chapter of religious history has concluded,'' Falwell
said from Dallas, where he was attending a meeting.
   Falwell, who briefly took over PTL at Bakker's request when he
resigned in 1987, said he had ``no interest in defending my brief
involvement with PTL some two and a half years ago, as that has
already been well documented.''
   Employees at Bakker's current ministry, operating out of a
shopping center in Orlando, Fla., were stunned by the conviction.
   ``I can't believe it. I think there's been some kind of
mistake,'' said Don Baldwin, acting general manager of Jim and
Tammy Ministries, which runs a church and produces a television
show broadcast by eight cable outlets.
   Bakker resigned from PTL after confessing to a sexual encounter
with former church secretary Jessica Hahn.
   ``I don't feel sad for what happened to Bakker,'' Hahn, 30, told
The Associated Press. ``I'd like to look him in the eye and tell
him `get out the rowboat, you can't walk on water.'
   The Assemblies of God, which defrocked Bakker in May 1987, last
month launched a 10-year effort to win over 5 million people, open
5,000 new churches and train 20,000 new ministers.
   ``The church did what it had to do in 1987 and we feel we have
put that behind us and we are going on with the business of the
church,'' said Juleen Turnage, spokeswoman for the 2.5
million-member denomination.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Sends Execution Report Directly to Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil libertarians are criticizing Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist for bypassing the federal courts'
policy-making body and sending Congress a plan that could lead to
swifter executions for death row inmates.
   The move also appears to have dismayed many of Rehnquist's
colleagues on the Judicial Conference, the 28 federal judges headed
by Rehnquist who serve as a kind of board of directors for the
federal courts.
   Fourteen of the judges wrote Congress to request hearings on
whatever recommendations the conference makes, according to today's
editions of The New York Times.
   Rehnquist's move ``would essentially render the (U.S.) Judicial
Conference impotent,'' Leslie Harris of the American Civil
Liberties Union told Legal Times, a Washington-based newspaper for
lawyers.
   In its Oct. 2 issue, the newspaper quoted opponents as saying
Rehnquist's action may suggest federal judges are split over what
changes, if any, are needed in handling death penalty appeals.
   The 14 judges, including the chief judges of eight of the 13
federal judicial circuits, this week wrote conference secretary
Ralph Mecham asking him to ``transmit to the chairmen of the Senate
and House Judiciary Committees a request that hearings be held so
that the recommendations of the Judicial Conference, which will be
adopted at its next meeting, can be considered,'' according to The
New York Times.
   Mecham told the newspaper he had forwarded the letter.
   A special committee appointed by Rehnquist issued a report last
month offering a plan to reform a system it said encourages endless
legal maneuvering, years of delay and frenzied last-minute moves to
stave off executions in the 37 states with death penalty laws.
   The committee report was submitted to the Judicial Conference,
but action on it _ and any recommendation to Congress _ was
postponed until the conference's next meeting, March 13.
   The committee recommended that states enact laws to limit death
row inmates to two rounds of appeals in state and federal courts.
One round would challenge a verdict directly; a second would be
based on alleged violations of an inmate's rights.
   The current system permits successive rounds of appeals in the
federal courts.
   States that choose to adopt the new system, which would require
congressional approval, would have to assure legal help to death
row inmates at taxpayer expense throughout the appeals process.
That is not the case now.
   Rehnquist forwarded the report to the chairmen of the House and
Senate judiciary committees, without any recommendation, on Sept.
22 _ the day after it was made public.

   White House aide Richard C. Breeden, President
Bush's choice to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, is
clearing his calendar and planning when he would take office
following his Senate confirmation.
   The Senate in a late-night session Wednesday approved Breeden's
nomination on a voice vote, several hours after he had been
unanimously recommended by the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee.
   Although Breeden is the numerical replacement for departing SEC
member Charles C. Cox, he is expected to be named by Bush to head
the agency that oversees securities markets, regulates the sale of
stocks, bonds and stock options and enforces securities laws.
   David Ruder, the previous chairman, returned to teaching law at
Northwestern University on Sept. 30. In the interim, Bush has
appointed SEC member Edward H. Fleischman as acting chairman.
   Breeden, 39, a 1975 graduate of Harvard Law School who was
deputy counsel from 1982-85 for then-Vice President Bush, has
served the president in a variety of capacities, most recently as
an architect of the legislation that helped bail out the nation's
ailing savings and loan industry.
   Breeden sailed through confirmation hearings before the Banking
Committee last month.

<NOTE>Making Social Security Independent Would Be `Devastating,' HHS</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, reiterating the Bush administration's position, says a
move in Congress to make the Social Security Administration an
independent agency would be ``devastating'' to the elderly.
   ``This would be devastating for senior Americans'' because it
would disrupt services to them, Sullivan told a National Press Club
luncheon audience Thursday.
   He also said it would mean the ``serious and legitimate concerns
regarding care and support of our senior citizens will lose Cabinet
level advocacy.''
   Social Security is now part of the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   Supporters of the proposals in Congress say that making Social
Security an independent federal agency would give it increased
visibility and would protect its trust funds from being tapped for
other uses.
   Measures to make Social Security independent of HHS are in the
budget reconciliation bill passed by the House on Thursday and in
the Senate's reconciliation bill that will be acted on soon.
   ``If the system ain't broke, don't fix it,'' Sullivan said,
``and we maintain that the system (Social Security) is working
better than ever.''

<TEXT>
   A toy maker is voluntarily recalling a rattle
because it could present a choking, breathing or eating hazard to
small children, the manufacturer and a safety commission say.
   The rattles may be broken in use and expose small parts that
could be eaten or swallowed by small children and cause them to
choke, said a statement released Thursday by the Consumer Product
Safety Commission.
   Some 60,000 of the rattles, which have a center section shaped
as a bear's face, butterfly, ball or train engine, were sold
nationwide through J.C. Penney stores.
   The toy maker, Louisiana-based Mini-Togs, Inc., said the rattles
were distributed with two baby bibs, but the recall involves only
``Baby Bib'' model 200.
   No choking incidents have been reported, but consumers should
immediately return the rattles for $1.00 refunds from the stores
where they were purchased, the safety commission said.

   Nine people were killed and scores
hospitalized Thursday night when a fire broke out in a 160-bed
nursing home, authorities said.
   The fire was reported shortly after 10:30 p.m. on the second
floor of the Hillhaven Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center, a
four-story brick structure, said Norfolk Fire Chief Thomas E.
Gardner.
   ``We've avoided a really major disaster,'' Gardner said.
   The cause and extent of the fire, which was extinguished after
midnight, were not immediately known.
   Authorities said seven bodies had been accounted for at the
scene, and two more people were dead on arrival at Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital.
   Dazed and confused, Hillhaven residents were taken to nearby
yards where firefighters, paramedics and neighbors tried to calm
them and keep them warm against the night air.
   Inside the structure, firefighters found scores of bedridden
patients whom they gingerly guided down ladders and smoke-filled
hallways. Some patients were in their bedclothes; others were
naked. All seemed frightened.
   Many of those overcome by smoke were taken to Sentara Norfolk
General Hospital.
   Among them was Robert J. Bell, 82, who said he was in his room
on the second floor when the fire broke out.
   ``I woke up in a roomful of smoke,'' he said. ``The whole room
was saturated with smoke. You couldn't see and you couldn't hardly
breathe.''
   Another second-floor resident, who was treated in the hospital's
emergency room, 76-year-old Harriett Waddill, said:
   ``Everything was quiet. We were going to bed. All of a sudden we
heard this commotion in the hall. They were running up and down the
hall and they were yelling, `Get him out of the room.' It was
getting so black I couldn't even identify where my bed was.''
   Hillhaven staff members knelt at the sides of many patients who
were not immediately taken to hospitals.
   One man, who knelt between two patients, patted their heads and
rubbed their shoulders, all the while telling them: ``You're safe.
It will be all right.''

<HEAD>New Justice Minister Named; Two Injured in Explosions in Bogota</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco named a new
justice minister to lead Colombia's crackdown on drug traffickers
after they sent death threats to the previous official and
reportedly warned other candidates for the job.
   His government also announced plans Thursday for a referendum on
whether suspected drug traffickers should be extradited to the
United States.
   Late Thursday, two bombs exploded at a supermarket and a bank in
Bogota, injuring two people, police said.The explosions were
believed part of the traffickers' violent response to the
government's unprecedented 7-week-old crackdown on drugs.
   Since Aug. 23, when cocaine chieftains declared a ``total war''
against the government, traffickers have been blamed for 148
bombings that have killed 10 people and wounded 165.
   A government spokesman said Roberto Salazar Manrique, former
treasury official and deputy director of the national bank,
accepted the job as justice minister.
   But five people, including three government officials, turned
down the post after receiving death threats from drug traffickers,
according to Colombian news reports.
   Traffickers from the powerful Medellin cartel are blamed in the
1984 slaying of Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. Since 1981,
about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed.
   Traffickers also threatened Salazar's predecessor, Monica de
Greiff, who quit on Sept. 21 after disagreements with President
Virgilio Barco on the country's anti-drug policy. Salazar becomes
Barcos' ninth justice minister.
   As justice minister, Salazar heads the government's war against
trafficking. He processes extraditions of Colombian drug
traffickers to the United States.
   As part of emergency measures declared during the crackdown, the
government revived Colombia's extradition treaty with the United
States.
   Cocaine bosses have enjoyed relative impunity from Colombian
courts through payoffs or intimidation of judges and they want the
government to reverse its stand on extradition.
   So far just one suspect has been extradited, but proceedings are
under way against another. Two more are being held pending the
arrival of U.S. documents asking for their extradition.
   Barco's plan for a referendum on the extradition issue was
announced in a communique late Thursday. The vote could come as
early as January.
   The naming of a new Justice Minister came as part of Barco's
second Cabinet change in three months. Communications Minister
Carlos Lemos Simmonds was named interior minister.
   Replacing him at the Communications Ministry will be Enrique
Danies Rincones, the former governor of Guajira state.
   The army late Thursday caught three alleged hired assassins just
before they were to meet with leaders of the Medellin cartel,
according to national television news.
   The army reportedly caught the two men and one woman on a farm
in Versalles, in the state of Antioquia, which includes the city of
Medellin.
   The three were reportedly waiting for Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, who together with Jorge Luis Ochoa, are thought to
control the Medellin cartel.
   The Barco administration has offered a $250,000 reward for
information leading to the capture of Rodriguez and Escobar, both
on the list of 12 Colombian drug figures most wanted for
extradition.
   The Barco government declared war on the traffickers following
the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate Luis
Carlos Galan, an anti-drug crusader.

141.80 yen and 142.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 140.19-point
gainer Thursday, shed 313.64 points, or 0.88 percent, closing at
35,209.35.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's strength followed a
surprising upswing in overseas markets Thursday despite interest
rate hikes by central banks of West Germany and several other
European countries.
   The Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, raised its key
lending rates by 1 percentage point, including the official
discount rate to 6 percent, to help curb the dollar's strength and
stem inflationary pressures in that country.
   Central banks in Britain, France and other European nations made
similar moves.
   The discount rate, the rate a nation's central bank charges on
loans to commercial banks, has a strong impact on other domestic
interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to support a currency.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said Japan's
central bank stepped into the market intermittently during early
trading to sell dollars, but said ``The intervention helped
little'' to stop the dollar's upward pressure.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its monetary activities,
but traders estimated the size of the intervention at about $100
million.
   Tanahashi said the market was awaiting U.S. unemployment figures
for September, due out later Friday in Washington, as a factor in
finding the dollar's direction.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a news
conference Friday morning that Japan will watch carefully for any
impact from the West Germany's interest rate raise, but said Japan
``isn't thinking of changing its monetary policy'' for now.
   On the stock market, the market's main barometer held back for
the first time in three days, due to the West German interest hikes
and the yen's easing against the dollar, stock dealers said.
   They said concern over the upcoming U.S. jobless rate was
another factor keeping many investors on the sidelines.

   A Florida Supreme Court ruling that
allows teen-age girls to have abortions without their parents'
consent was criticized by Gov. Bob Martinez as a blow to the
sanctity of the family.
   ``I'm going to work to make certain that somehow parental
consent comes back,'' Martinez said Thursday. ``If the Florida
Supreme Court will not protect children, and parents cannot, then
the Legislature must, by passing new abortion clinic regulations.''
   In a majority decision Thursday, the court struck down a 1988
law requiring girls under age 18 to get the consent of a parent,
guardian or judge for abortions. The state's constitutional
guarantee of privacy outweighed the law, the court said.
   ``The challenged statute fails because it intrudes upon the
privacy of the pregnant minor from conception to birth,'' the court
wrote. ``Such a substantial invasion of a pregnant female's privacy
by the state for the full term of the pregnancy is not necessary
for the preservation of maternal health or the potentiality of
life.''
   The court's ruling came just five days before the state
Legislature was to convene in a special session called by Martinez
to consider new laws restricting access to abortion.
   Senate President Bob Crawford said he planned to ask Martinez to
postpone the session in the wake of the court's decision.
   ``I think it demonstrates very clearly that the abortion session
is premature,'' Crawford said.
   Attorney General Bob Butterworth, charged with defending state
statutes, said his office would petition the court for a rehearing
in the case of a 15-year-old Lake County girl, identified in court
records as T.W.
   In Washington, Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women, said the Florida decision sends ``a
powerful message to the Supreme Court.''
   ``Our position is that the constitutional right to abortion
extends to all women, regardless of their age, regardless of where
they reside,'' she said.
   Ken Connor, president of Florida Right to Life, called the
decision ``a big defeat for the unborn child.''
   Charlene Carres, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties
Union in Tallahassee, called the decision a ``huge victory.''
   ``It's turning back the tide of an apparent trend in,
especially, the U.S. Supreme Court ... to allow erosion of these
rights,'' Carres said. ``The Florida Supreme Court in effect has
said `No, the tide here doesn't go that way. We have built a dam.'
''
   T.W. was denied permission for an abortion by a local judge, but
her appeal wound its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which returned
the case without comment to the Florida Supreme Court.
   In the decision, the Florida court noted the U.S. Supreme Court
``has made it clear that the states, not the federal government,
are the final guarantors of personal privacy.''
   ``We can conceive of few more personal or private decisions
concerning one's body that one can make in the course of a
lifetime,'' the court determined in upholding a 5th District Court
of Appeals decision.
   The court opinion revealed that T.W. lawfully received an
abortion while the case was under review. She was identified in
court records as a high school student active in band and flag
corps who was worried that news of an abortion would kill her
ailing mother.
   Four of the seven justices concurred in the decision, two partly
dissented and Justice Parker McDonald disagreed principally on
common law provisions that say minors lack the right to enter into
contracts.
   The court heard oral arguments June 27. But after the U.S.
Supreme Court issued a ruling in July giving states more latitude
to regulate abortions, the Florida court asked the parties to
submit new briefs taking that decision and Florida's privacy
provision into account.
   Also in July, Martinez scheduled a special session for Oct.
10-13 and issued four objectives he wanted lawmakers to consider.
   Martinez is seeking fetal viability tests; a ban on use of
public funds, personnel and facilities for abortions; tougher
abortion clinic standards; and a notice to women seeking abortions
on the development of their fetuses.

   The creators of California cuisine dined on
salmon-stuffed grape leaves and other delicacies as they dished out
awards to the top contributors to the state's gustatory scene.
   Besides honoring its best and brightest at the awards ceremony
Wednesday night, the American Institute of Wine and Food celebrated
what members said was California's contribution to changing
American tastes.
   ``Northern California has been in the forefront of new ideas and
developments in cuisine,'' said master of ceremonies Narsai David,
who received the top citation, for education.
   ``What was called `California cuisine' has become American
cuisine _ freshly prepared superb ingredients, frequently served
with the very simplest of sauces,'' said David, food authority,
wine expert, shopkeeper, three-star restaurateur and commentator in
the San Francisco Bay area for 25 years.
   Some 240 epicures paid $60 a plate to dine on an impressive
variety of delicacies at the Californian Culinary Academy and to
salute the winners of the 10 Wine and Food Achievement, or
``Wafie'' awards.
   Guests enjoyed hors d'oeuvres that included smoked chicken with
honey mustard; grape leaves stuffed with salmon, fried artichokes,
goat cheese with sun-dried tomatoes, and sauteed Texas venison
marinated in cabernet.
   Those who weren't already full then sat down to crayfish with
caviar dressing, quail and lentils, and rack of lamb with elephant
garlic. The courses were accompanied by select chardonnay, pinot
noir and cabernet sauvignon. All the foods and wines were donated.
   Other ``Wafie'' winners included Jerry DiVeccchio of Sunset
Magazine, for literature and journalism; winemaker Zelma Long of
Simi Winery; chef Alice Waters of Chez Panisse; pioneer California
oyster farmers Michael Watchorn and John Finger; and Chuck Williams
of Williams-Sonoma, the kitchen accessory chain whose glossy
catalog is mailed to 77 million people.

   Downed power lines after a hurricane are more
likely to kill nowadays than the storm's fierce winds and mighty
sea surges, according to a federal study of Hugo's swipe across
Puerto Rico last month.
   Of nine deaths associated with Hurricane Hugo's pass over Puerto
Rico on Sept. 18, just two came by drowning in the storm's rains
and floods, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Seven people died in accidental electrocutions, however, most
during cleanup efforts.
   Five electric company workmen died in separate accidents
repairing downed power lines. A sixth man was electrocuted taking
down a TV antenna before the storm, and another man was
electrocuted when he hit a downed electric line while chopping
trees after the storm hit.
   ``In the past,'' the CDC said in its weekly report,
``hurricane-related mortality has occurred primarily as a result of
drownings ... associated with storm surges'' _ the huge wave of
water hurricanes bring at landfall.
   ``It looks like the pattern may be changing,'' said Dr. Rossanne
Philen, a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC. ``Because of the
increased forecasting ability we have, we're able to evacuate more
people ahead of time.''
   In Puerto Rico, more than 18,000 people were evacuated from
flood-prone areas the night before the storm.
   ``But we found, unfortunately, in Puerto Rico that the cleanup
efforts led to quite a few deaths,'' she said. ``People need to be
aware of the possible dangers. Just because the hurricane is gone,
it doesn't mean you are no longer at risk of injury or death.''
   ``Public health officials ... must realize that the ... risks
associated with hurricanes extend beyond the impact phase,'' the
CDC said. ``Efforts to minimize injury and other health risks for
both disaster-relief workers and the general population are
crucial.''
   At least 71 deaths ultimately were attributed to Hugo as it
moved across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Carolinas and
rained itself out over the northeastern United States. At least a
dozen deaths ultimately were logged in Puerto Rico.
   The CDC said the same pattern occurred four years earlier when
Tropical Storm Isabelle hammered the island, killing 95 _ only 21
of whom drowned.
   Researchers from the CDC are studying the effects of Hugo in the
Virgin Islands and along the South Carolina coast. They plan
further analysis on the storm and the injuries and deaths that
resulted.

<HEAD>Lyme Disease Doubles to Record Levels; Some Precautions Not Realistic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For Northeastern suburbanites increasingly at
risk for Lyme disease, the tick-borne illness has grown so much
that bug spray may not be a realistic solution, federal health
officials say.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that
4,572 cases of Lyme disease were reported last year, 13 years after
it was first identified in the United States. That's almost doubled
from 1987, when 2,368 cases were reported, and up more than
ninefold from 1982's 492 cases.
   In 1987-88, 80 percent of the U.S. cases were reported in six
Northeastern states: New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
   New York alone reported 56 percent of the 1988 cases, and two
counties in the suburbs around New York City _ Westchester and
Suffolk _ reported 44 percent.
   Health professionals recommend protective clothing and insect
repellent to guard against ticks carrying the disease. But in some
high-risk areas that may not be realistic, the Atlanta-based CDC
said.
   ``In suburban areas where (Lyme disease) is endemic, infection
may be acquired principally around ... residences, and risk of
exposure may be continuous during the transmission season,'' the
agency said.
   ``Under these circumstances, certain personal protection
measures (such as) the daily application of repellents, may not be
practical.''
   The disease can cause rash, aches and even life-threatening
heart disturbances. Most cases occur in the warm weather months,
when the tick problem is worst.
   ``Certainly, it is on the increase,'' said Dr. Robert Craven, a
Colorado-based Lyme disease specialist with the CDC. ``Everyone who
lives in an area where Lyme disease is probable should be aware of
it and take the necessary precautions.''
   It's recommended that suburbanites clear their yards of leaves
and debris that can harbor tick-carrying rodents. Craven said
scientists are studying ways to wage chemical warfare against ticks.
   The CDC said only nine states _ all west of the Mississippi _
have not reported Lyme disease. The agency said the increasing case
count is probably due not only to spread of the disease, but also
to increased awareness and reporting.
   The CDC also said health officials in New York and Connecticut
have reported five cases of seizures in people who used insect
repellents containing an ingredient known as DEET, or
N,N-diethyle-m-toluamide. The CDC said DEET _ present in many
best-selling bug sprays _ has been marketed in this country since
1956 and is used by 50 million to 100 million people each year.
   ``Obviously, this needs to be looked at in perspective,'' Craven
said. ``There have been reported cases of toxicity, as in any
compound. Certainly, some people are going to have allergic
reactions.''
   Four of the five seizure patients _ all of whom recovered
quickly _ were younger than 8; three of the cases were reported by
the same pediatric neurologist. At least six cases of toxic
reactions from repeated exposure to DEET have been reported since
1961, the CDC said.
   The CDC said none of the New York-Connecticut cases have been
confirmed as DEET poisoning, but the agency recommended not
applying insect repellent in large quantities to exposed skin,
especially in children.

   Soldiers stormed the building where
opposition leader Guillermo Endara was holding a hunger strike, but
a colleague said he was safely spirited away before the raid.
   A nearby resident said the troopers fired tear gas in the raid
late Thursday. It came hours after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who
survived a coup attempt Tuesday, told the nation that the
government would get tough with its opponents.
   Endara, the former opposition presidential candidate, ``is now
in a safe place,'' a collegue, Willie Cochez, said later Thursday.
He would not elaborate.
   Endara is in the 16th day of a fast. He wants Panamanians to
delay tax payments and boycott government lotteries and casinos,
thus depriving the government of needed revenues.
   In Noriega's televised speech, he ridiculed Endara's hunger
strike and said he had evidence that the United States had planned
to install Endara as president. Noriega annulled May 7 national
balloting that international observers said Endara was winning by a
3-1 margin.
   Noriega compared the coup attempt with the failed U.S.-backed
Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 and said he would propose a
package of ``war laws'' dealing with national security.
   Brandishing a rifle given him by supporters and quoting a
Spanish proverb, Noriega promised ``blows for the undecided, lead
for the enemy and silver for the friend'' in a speech from
Santiago, 150 miles west of Panama City.
   A resident living near the opposition office where Endara had
been staying said two truckloads of soldiers surrounded the block,
stopped traffic and then entered the building. apparently looking
for Endara.
   Journalists were kept 200 yards away from the scene.
   Associated Press photographer John Hopper was hit on the head
and his equipment was confiscated. The wound required stitches.
Equipment also was taken from a cameraman for an American
television network.
   Cochez would not say how Endara managed to leave the offices
without being captured by troops.
   Security forces were at the building throughout much of the day.
When reinforcements arrived, eight gunmen in civilian clothes fired
in the air outside Endara's office, dispersing scores of supporters.
   Earlier, members of the Defense Forces dressed in civilian
clothes entered the building and arrested two people. They held
everybody inside for three hours.
   Ten rebels died and 23 people, including three members of
Noreiga's general staff, were arrested when troops loyal to the
government crushed the revolt, the government said.
   Calling the coup attempt another Bay of Pigs, Noriega said the
United States ``had left in the lurch those it had bribed.''
   He said American troops from the Southern Command military
installations along the Panama Canal tried to block loyal forces
from coming to his rescue when soldiers took him hostage in the
Defense Forces headquarters building.
   ``They should not be hypocritical,'' Noriega said referring to
the United States. ``They were involved.''
   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the rebels
contacted U.S. military officials in Panama and requested possible
blockage of routes leading to the headquarters building. He said,
however, President Bush never gave the orders to block the routes.
   The United States has used political and economic pressure to
force Noriega from his post as chief of the Defense Forces since
February 1988, when he was indicted in Florida on drug trafficking
charges.
   Noriega denies the allegations and says the U.S. is trying to
back off 1977 treaties that give his country control of the Panama
Canal in 1999.
   Dressed in civilian clothes and wearing a Panama hat, the
general said in the speech the ``war laws'' would boost the
economy, benefit the people and ``take away the privileges of the
traitors.''
   In a referrence to the jubilation that overtook government
offices during the coup attempt, Noreiga urged government employees
to list ``traitors'' in their ranks.
   ``Public employees who are not nationalists must be fired so we
can give those jobs to worthy men,'' he said. ``A public official
who does not fire the traitors is himself a traitor.''
   Questions persisted about whether the rebel soldiers killed died
during the conflict or later. Nine of the 10 who died were officers.
   The government has said only that they died in the coup attempt.

   As the countdown reached zero and the rocket
rumbled to life, Jim Bennett's emotions hopscotched from anxiety to
elation to puzzlement and, ultimately, to sickening disappointment.
   Bennett, president of American Rocket Co., watched on a video
monitor Thursday morning as his company's product _ billed as the
nation's first commercially developed and built rocket _ went up in
flames on the launch pad.
   The failure of the launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base left
Bennett and his 90-some employees with an emotional hurdle to
overcome as they look to the next launch attempt. The Camarillo,
Calif., company will wait six months to a year before trying a
second launch.
   ``It's just a sick feeling. We worked so hard, and it meant so
much to us,'' Bennett said in a telephone interview. ``We worked a
long time to get this far and we hoped that it would be a success,
that we can go on. At this point we can go on, but we don't have
that success.''
   The attempted launch of the 58-foot-tall unmanned rocket was an
especially emotional moment for Amroc's employees because of the
July death of company founder George Koopman in an automobile
accident. The rocket was nicknamed the ``Koopman Express.''
   The rocket was to have soared on a $2 million, 15-minute
suborbital flight, conducting two experiments.
   In a test of satellite sensors being developed for the Star Wars
missile defense system, the rocket was to release a cloud of inert
gas. The idea was to see if the gas would shield the rocket from
detection by sensors aboard the military's Delta Star satellite.
   The rocket also was supposed to deploy a 390-pound test model of
an 8{-foot-wide ``ParaShield.'' Designed by Massachusetts Institute
of Technology students, it is a combined heat shield and parachute
that someday might be used in a new type of re-entry vehicle, such
as an escape system to allow space station astronauts to return to
Earth.
   Early indications were the launch failed because a liquid oxygen
valve opened only 20 percent to 30 percent, said George
Whittinghill, Amroc marketing director. Not enough liquid oxygen
fuel reached the engine to mix with solid fuel, so the thrust was
inadequate for liftoff.
   For Bennett, the launch drama played itself out across video
screens and electronic monitors in his post in the Launch
Operations Control Center on the base 140 miles northwest of Los
Angeles.
   Hopes ran high as the countdown concluded _ to the second _
within the two-minute launch window. Another launch attempt on
Sept. 28 had to be scrapped because bad weather pushed Amroc past
the launch window.
   ``At first we were kind of elated because we made the countdown
to the second, really an achievement on a first flight,'' Bennett
said.
   At 10:28 a.m., the engine ignited, but flames shot up the sides
of the rocket. Spectators shouted, ``It didn't take off! It didn't
take off!'' Koopman's widow and sister started to cry.
   As Bennett drove from the base to his hotel, he thought of how
company founder Koopman would have reacted.
   ``I knew George pretty well, and I know exactly what his
response would have been,'' said Bennett. ``He would have been up
there saying, `We're going to continue. We're going to succeed.'
And that's what we're going to do.''

<TEXT>
   A train carrying more than 600 East
German refugees rolled into West Germany today after a similar
exodus had been disrupted several hours by thousands seeking to
board the freedom trains.
   The East Germans, chanting ``Deutschland!'' and shouting thanks,
left Warsaw by train Thursday night on a trip via their communist
homeland and arrived in Laatzen, a Hanover suburb, nearly 14 hours
later.
   West Germans welcomed the 633 refugees with cheers and pats on
the back. The refugees looked well-rested and more relaxed than
those who arrived earlier in the week from Czechoslovakia.
   West German officials and Red Cross workers readied temporary
housing and other forms of care.
   Those aboard had crowded West Germany's embassy in Warsaw in
hopes of joining the East Germans who have made their way through
Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland since mid-September. More than
47,000 East Germans have left since then.
   West German radio and television reported that as soon as the
train left, about a dozen more East Germans entered Bonn's embassy
in Warsaw in hopes of gaining permission to go West.
   The journey comes as East Germany, deeply embarrassed by the
exodus, begins two days of celebrations marking the communist
country's 40th anniversary.
   Among those flying in to attend the festivities is Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who is expected to ask East
Germany's aging hard-line leaders how they plan to handle the
westward flight that is draining much of the East Germany's work
force.
   West German radio said some people reportedly were ``gravely
injured'' when East German police in Dresden prevented people from
boarding trains heading West late Wednesday and early Thursday.
Also, 150 injuries and 80 arrests reportedly occurred during a
demonstration Monday in Leipzig by 20,000 East Germans.
   The figures were cited at a prayer service in an East Berlin
church late Thursday, the radio said without elaborating.
   Poland contributed two extra cars to a six-car East German train
sent to carry the refugees to West Germany, which grants them
automatic citizenship and helps them start new lives.
   Julia Lange said the train stopped shortly after crossing from
Poland to East Germany and officials boarded.
   ``We were informed that we were being expelled and they
collected our passports,'' said Ms. Lange, 30.
   The freedom trains that left Czechoslovakia brought 7,600 East
Germans to the West Thursday.
   In Prague, 200 East Germans left the West German Embassy late
Thursday and headed home with promises from their government of
legal emigration within months. Sources said about 10 East Germans
still were inside the mission.
   Czechoslovak police used riot police to seal off the embassy
from more East Germans. East Germany restricted travel to
Czechoslovakia earlier this week.
   There was sympathy among Czechoslovaks for the East German
refugees. The hard-line Prague government has also refused
democratic reform.
   ``Of course they are running away,'' a 40-year-old Czechoslovak
said on condition of anonymity. ``They want freedom.
   ``I am sure this will have some impact on our country ... but it
will take some time because our leadership is very conservative.''
   East Germans began making their way west through Hungary in May
when that communist country removed obstacles from its border with
Austria. Since Hungary officially opened its borders Sept. 10,
about 32,000 East Germans have used that route to West Germany.
   About 7,000 more East Germans arrived in West Germany last
weekend from Warsaw and Prague, where they had taken refuge in West
German embassies.
   Police in Dresden reportedly used clubs and water cannons to
drive thousands of people back from the main railroad station
during the exodus from Czechoslovakia.
   ``It was a horrible scene,'' said a woman in Dresden who asked
not to be identified because she feared reprisals. ``People were
trying desperately to get to the platforms and the tracks, but the
police forced them back.''
   Masses of regular police, secret police and workers' groups
organized by the Communist Party dispersed the crowds and sealed
off the stations.
   East Germany insisted the trains pass through its territory,
rather than crossing into West Germany from Czechoslovakia, so it
could formally declare the refugees expelled.

   Twenty relatives of political
prisoners and ``disappeared'' people held 13 hostages at the Costa
Rican Embassy to protest repression by the rightist government but
said they would leave today.
   The group, the Federation of Committees of Mothers and Relatives
of Political Prisoners, initially took 16 hostages when they
stormed the embassy compound Thursday.
   But Ambassador Jesus Fernandez was taken from the embassy in an
ambulance later in the day and two other diplomats were allowed to
leave the offices.
   Fernandez, who had heart bypass surgery two months ago, appeared
to be breathing with difficulty as he left the building. He was
taken to a hospital and then sent home, the ambassador's wife,
Janine, said.
   The 20 human rights activists, who were mostly women, allowed
Consul-General Humberto Murillo and First Secretary Rene Aldama to
leave the third-floor offices to talk to Fernandez's wife through
the back gate.
   The consul said four women and nine men were still being held.
Also in the offices but not being held hostage early today were
four journalists, three of them Americans.
   A spokeswoman for the group said on condition of anonymity that
the activists would leave the embassy today.
   The action was to draw attention to alleged human rights
violations under the rightist government that took power June 1 and
to pressure the administration ``to take concrete measures'' to end
the decade-old civil war, the spokeswoman said.
   The Federation of Committees for the past eight years has
protested the kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists by
rightist death squads.
   Fernandez said some of the activists were armed. He did not say
what weapons they carried, but reporters saw what appeared to be a
handgun tucked into the pantwaist of one woman.
   There were also several packets of what looked like fuses
wrapped in newspaper.
   In a communique late Thursday, the government said the
demonstrators were armed with grenades and handguns. It called the
takeover ``a flagrant violation of the human rights of the people
taken hostage.''
   The government statement said the takeover was intended ``to
frustrate the dialogue process,'' a reference to preliminary peace
talks with leftist guerrillas that began last month in Mexico. They
are scheduled to proceed Oct. 16-17 in Costa Rica.
   Fernandez said the hostage-takers made no specific demands or
stated conditions for eventually abandoning the embassy.
   ``They have made their point,'' he said.
   Several dozen soldiers and police surrounded the six-story
embassy building shortly after the takeover. But Fernandez asked
that the cordon be lifted, and by early today only 20 troopers
manned unobtrusive positions around the block.
   The government of President Alfredo Cristiani considers the
group _ as well as dozens of other union, peasant and human rights
organizations _ leftist guerrilla fronts.
   More than 70,000 people have been killed since a leftist
guerrillas began their war against a succession of U.S.-backed
governments a decade ago. Human rights groups say many victims have
been civilians slain by right-wing death squads.
   Cristiani's party, the Republican Nationalist Alliance, has been
linked to the death squads. After taking office, Cristiani said he
planned to introduce draft legislation giving the police, armed
forces and courts a freer hand against suspected subversives.
   Opposition political, union and human rights organizations have
described the proposed measures as totalitarian.

<HEAD>Women's Groups Outraged at Jury's Decision Blaming Woman for Rape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The acquittal of a rape suspect on
grounds that the woman wore a lace miniskirt with no underwear was
a ``horrendous'' verdict that could deter victims from prosecuting
rapists, counselors said.
   ``No woman asks to be raped,'' Dorothea Gallagher of the
National Organization for Women's Broward County chapter said
Thursday. ``I can't think of any other crime in which people would
say that the victim asked for it.''
   A jury of three men and three women said just that in explaining
their acquittal of Steven Lord, 26, on kidnapping and rape charges
Wednesday.
   ``She asked for it,'' foreman Roy Diamond said. ``The way she
was dressed with that skirt, you could see everything she had. She
was advertising for sex.''
   ``She was obviously dressed for a good time, but we felt she may
have bit off more than she could chew,'' juror Mary Bradshaw said.
   According to testimony, the 22-year-old woman wore a tank top
and a short, white lace skirt without underwear last Nov. 6, the
night she said she was raped.
   Alexander Siegel, the woman's attorney, said his client was
``bewildered, shocked, angry, astounded'' by the verdict.
   Detective Tom White of the Indian River County Sheriff's
Department, who worked on the case, termed the acquittal ``very
disappointing.''
   ``I honestly believe as a police officer that he raped her, that
he forcibly had sex with her,'' White said. ``I took her to the
emergency room. We took her clothing and her car into evidence, we
caught him the following day.''
   White said the woman told him that Lord took off her underwear
when he allegedly raped her the first time.
   Joanne Richter, director of the Sexual Assault Treatment Center
in Fort Lauderdale, said the verdict could discourage rape victims
from prosecuting their attackers.
   ``No matter who you are or what you are wearing, it doesn't mean
you should be a victim of sexual assault,'' Richter said. ``I am
having a hard time believing that people think that if you're not
dressed appropriately that you should be a victim of sexual
assault.''
   ``It's a fairly horrendous verdict,'' said Ellen Vargyas at the
National Women's Law Center in Washington, D.C.
   At the trial, the woman said Lord pulled a knife on her in a
Fort Lauderdale restaurant parking lot, forced her into her car,
drove north on Interstate 95, and pulled over twice to rape her at
knife-point.
   Defense attorney Tim Day told jurors the woman agreed to have
sex with Lord in exchange for $100 and cocaine, but later changed
her mind.
   ``How could anyone think that someone would want to be cut up
with a knife, hit with a rock and raped?'' Siegel said. ``They put
her on trial.''
   That's common, though, said Sally Goldfarb, staff attorney at
the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York.
   ``In most rape trials it's the victim, not the suspect, that's
on trial,'' she said.
   Barbara Mitchell, who heads the sexual crimes and child abuse
section of the Broward State Attorney's Office, said the attitudes
reflected in the jurors' comments die hard.
   ``I thought we had done a better job educating the public,'' she
said. ``We'll have to try it again.''

<HEAD>Tufts University Abolishes Speech-Limiting Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Tufts University
rescinded a ban on verbal attacks after legal experts suggested the
ban, prompted by an offensive T-shirt, violated students' First
Amendment rights to free speech.
   ``I have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of
free speech,'' Jean Mayer said Thursday in an interview. ``We
decided we would decide each case on its merits.''
   Students had rallied around the right to free speech and
objected to the policy published in the student handbook, which
barred verbal attacks, whether spoken or written, against an
individual's race, ethnic group, religion or sexual orientation.
   But Billy Jacobson, the student body president, said he was
sorry to see the university drop a policy supported by many of its
7,000 students.
   ``The university has a responsibility to protect students,'' he
said. ``It can't insulate students, but this is their home and
students shouldn't have to worry about going into their dorms and
their dining halls and seeing something offensive to them.''
   The policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an
enterprising student marketed a T-shirt stating 15 reasons ``Why
Beer is Better than Women at Tufts.'' All 15 reasons disparaged
women. One of the more printable ones was ``Hangovers go away.''
   The T-shirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50
hours of community service. But Mayer recommended the Committee on
Student Life reconsider that sentence, which it eventually
suspended when lawyers advised it was unconstitutional.
   The student life committee, comprising faculty and students,
imposed the free speech restriction last June on the campus abut
six miles outside Boston. Protests began after the policy made its
way into this year's student handbook.
   Some experts say the First Amendment only bars the government
from restricting speech and doesn't apply to private universities,
Mayer said. But others say it upholds free speech anywhere, short
of sparking a riot, he said.
   However, a court ruling found a similar policy at the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor was unconstitutional and vague, Mayer said.

   Some folks in this small southeastern
Oklahoma town think the worst hurricane of the decade has given
their home a bad name.
   ``We want people in Charleston, South Carolina, to know that the
name Hugo doesn't always hurt,'' said William Rogers, president of
the local Lions Club.
   To prove it, Mayor Charles Sims proclaimed this week ``Help
Charleston Week,'' and Lions Club members organized a food drive
that netted nearly $7,000 in goods.
   A rented trailer will leave Monday to deliver the provisions to
Lions Club members in Charleston, Rogers said.
   Hurricane Hugo slammed into South Carolina Sept. 21 with winds
topping 135 mph, killing at least 18 and leaving 50,000 homeless.
   ``We just want them to know that the folks here in Hugo are a
lot friendlier than that hurricane was,'' Rogers said.

<HEAD>Nearly 300 Sickened as Furnace Leaks Fumes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TILTONSVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carbon monoxide fumes that sickened
nearly 300 people at a high school seeped from a cracked furnace
just after it was turned on for the first time this fall, the
district superintendent said.
   Dozens of students suffered headaches and nausea and a handful
briefly passed out Thursday morning at Buckeye Southwest High
School when the fumes wafted through ventilating systems into all
three floors of the school.
   Twenty-nine people were listed in fair or satisfactory condition
at two hospitals today. Three of the patients were in intensive
care for closer observation, including one with an asthmatic
condition, a hospital spokesman said.
   Another 256 people were sent home from the hospitals on
Thursday, officials said.
   An inspection uncovered a crack in one of the four furnaces in
the school's basement, said Ann Stephens, Buckeye Local Schools
Superintendent.
   Inspectors who conducted an annual examination in August didn't
find the crack.
   ``It was inside the furnace _ you can't see it without totally
tearing the furnace apart,'' Ms. Stephens said.
   Carbon monoxide fumes began escaping about 6 a.m. when
custodians turned on the gas heating system for the first time this
fall, Assistant Fire Chief Gary McHugh said. Firefighters were
called about 10:30 a.m. after students began complaining of nausea,
headaches, light-headedness and shortness of breath, he said.
   ``If they'd been in there for at least two more hours, it could
have been worse,'' McHugh said. ``A few of them could have died.''
   Authorities evacuted about 450 students and at least 25 teachers
from the school, which is about 5 miles up the Ohio River from
Wheeling, W.Va.
   Some 181 people were taken to Ohio Valley Medical Center in
Wheeling, where 21 were admitted and listed in fair condition,
hospital spokesman Chap Holbert said.
   Another 104 people were taken to East Ohio Regional Hospital in
Martins Ferry, where seven were listed in satisfactory condition
this morning and one was fair, Holbert said.
   All those admitted had low to moderate levels of carbon monoxide
in their blood, said Dr. Bruce Walmsley, coordinator emergency
services at both hospitals.
   The school probably will remain closed until Monday, and carbon
monoxide tests will be conducted daily to make sure the gas has
dissipated, Ms. Stephens said.

   Typhoon Angela today swept across the
northern Philippines and into the South China Sea, lashing the
mountainous area with up to 108 mph winds, officials said.
   There were no immediate reports of casualties and only sketchy
damage reports, officials said. Detailed damage and casualty
reports from remote areas often take days or weeks to reach Manila
because of poor communications.
   The Philippine Red Cross said eight houses were destroyed in
Nueva Vizcaya province and heavy rains were reported across
northern Luzon, the main Philippine island.
   The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services
Administration said that as of 4 p.m., the typhoon's center was
about 320 miles northwest of Manila.
   Angela was packing peak winds of 108 mph when it roared ashore
early Friday but weakened by midafternoon to about 93 mph,
forecasters said.
   The storm was moving west-northwest at 9 mph.
   The U.S. military's Far East Network, which broadcasts
television programs to American forces at bases in the Philippines,
described the storm as a ``super typhoon.''
   There were no reports of damage at the U.S. installations.
   Angela was the 15th typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. An
average of 20 typhoons or tropical storms strike the Philippines
every year.

<TEXT>
   A new student armed with a shotgun and a
pistol took a high-school drama class hostage and wounded one boy
who defied him before surrendering peacefully to police.
   The hostage ordeal at Loara High School Thursday ended 40
minutes after the 15-year-old gunman, clad in a trench coat,
entered the auditorium and took over a class of 35.
   Tony Lopez, 15, was in fair condition with a wound to the face,
said Fran Tardiff, spokeswoman at the University of California,
Irvine, Medical Center.
   Police identified the gunman as Cory Robb, who was being held
early today in a juvenile facility awaiting charges. Robb was
previously known to police, Chief Joseph Molloy said.
   Students described Robb as a troubled new student.
   The class was learning the parts of a stage when the teen-ager
came in and ordered the teacher to leave and lock the door behind
him, student Mindy DeLuca said.
   The teacher said, ``Come on class, we're going,'' related Miss
DeLuca, who identified the teacher only as Mr. Tuttle.
   The armed youth ordered the teacher out, then told the class to
``go sit with friends, do whatever you want to,'' Miss DeLuca said.
``He was relaxed after that.''
   ``I thought it was a joke because it was in drama,'' she said.
   The gunman was calm at the outset but Lopez began antagonizing
him, said student Jimmy Hurley, 15.
   ``He was telling him to `shoot me' _ and he did,'' Hurley said.
   The bullet hit Lopez in the left side of the jaw.
   ``He sat down next to me and he was bleeding pretty bad,''
Hurley said.
   Students screamed at the shot, then asked their captor if the
victim could leave. The wounded boy and all the girls in the class
were let go, leaving 10 to 12 boys, the students said.
   The armed teen-ager then called his mother from a telephone,
told her he had ``held up the room'' and asked to talk to his
stepfather, Hurley said. Calls then came in on the phone,
apparently from police, Hurley said.
   A hostage negotiator persuaded the boy to put down his guns in
the auditorium and walk outside to surrender. The boy was
cooperative, complied with instructions and didn't struggle, said
police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth.
   ``Wish we could tell you what his motive was. We just don't
know,'' Hedgpeth said. ``We're very thankful it ended as it did.''
   The arrested boy had attended the school for just a few weeks
and ``there was nothing to indicate he was after one particular
student,'' Hedgpeth said.

   ``Bimbo,'' a word much in vogue in the
scandal-ridden '80s, was first used as a relatively sexless term
for lackluster males of the Roaring Twenties. The slightly stuffy
word ``academy'' has a much racier past _ a daring exploit
involving a youthful Helen of Troy.
   From ``bunk,'' the unfortunate legacy of a longwinded
congressman, to ``zany,'' derived from the word for a 16th-century
Italian clown, a new book by dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster
Inc. examines the strange stories and forgotten figures lurking
behind everyday words.
   ``This book was a little bit more fun to work on than the usual
things we do here,'' said Frederick C. Mish, editorial director of
Merriam-Webster.
   ``Webster's Word Histories,'' touted as a companion for
``armchair etymologists,'' is a departure from the dictionary
publisher's generally sedate product, filled with lively prose and
complete with an eyecatching ``bikini'' entry on the jacket.
   ``That was probably picked because it would be of some
interest,'' Mish said dryly, hastily pointing out the selection was
an advertising _ not editorial _ decision.
   Scholarly tomes about the origins of words already exist, most
notably the Oxford English Dictionary, which exhaustively defines
hundreds of thousands of words and gives their sources.
   But Word Histories, published in September and priced at $14.95,
is aimed more at the kinds of people who contact Merriam-Webster
regularly, asking where words or phrases come from, Mish said.
   ``I make no bones about that, this is intended to be a popular
book,'' he said. ``We have not targeted linguists or historians or
any particular group of people of advanced educations or highly
specialized interests.''
   Audrey Duckert, a lexicographer at the University of
Massachusetts who has contributed to Merriam-Webster dictionaries
and to the last supplement of the Oxford English Dictionary, said
there are surprising numbers of non-scholars who are interested in
word origins.
   ``One of my jobs (at Merriam-Webster) was to answer all the
`Dear Mr. Webster' letters. I settled more Scrabble arguments than
you can shake a stick at,'' she said.
   ``Sometimes they're intimidated by scholarly things. Scholars
are very often put off by cutesy things. If this goes that middle
line between being cute and scholarly, I think it would be a good
thing,'' she said.
   Some of the derivations described are classical, such as
``academy,'' which stems from the abduction of the 12-year-old
Helen of Troy. A man named Akademos showed her brothers, Castor and
Pollux, where she was hidden. Athens later named a park and
gymnasium after him _ Akademeia. There, the philosopher Plato set
up his school, the prototype prep.
   Others put their stamp on less erudite words. ``Bunk,'' or
nonsense, is the unfortunate legacy of a long-winded early
19th-century congressman, Felix Walker, who represented the
district in which Buncombe County, N.C., is located.
   ``Bimbo,'' now used to describe attractive but foolish females,
is found as early as 1919 to describe ``a fellow who was
unimportant or undistinguished,'' according to Word Histories. The
word is believed to have derived from an Italian term for baby. Use
of the word to describe a sexually promiscuous woman did not catch
on until the advent of 1930s detective novels peopled by beautiful
but dumb blondes.
   ``Zany'' is believed to derive from an Italian dialect name for
a stock comedy character, Zanni, in improvised comedies of the 16th
century. The word first appeared in English in Shakespeare's
``Love's Labour Lost,'' with a reference to ``some slight Zanie.''
   Some words refuse to be neatly explained, and editors note in
the introduction to the book that etymology is not an exact science.
   For example, the entry for ``bikini,'' describes 1946 atomic
bomb tests on the atoll of Bikini in the Marshall Islands. ``In the
summer of 1947, another bombshell hit the beaches of the French
Riviera, the bikini,'' the entry continues.
   Editors confess they do not know how one led to the other,
although they offer the theories that the effect of a bikini-clad
woman compares to an atomic blast, or the ground-stripping effect
of an atomic blast compares to a bikini. A third theory, that the
shape of the atoll looks like a bikinied figure, is dismissed as
unlikely even to the ``most perfervid imagination.''
   By the way, ``perfervid,'' means extremely or excessively
fervent.

   At least 21 Sinhalese youths were shot
and killed, apparently by a vigilante group in retaliation for the
slaying of a volunteer solider, military officials said today.
   Authorities today found the bodies today 60 miles northeast of
Colombo, in central Kandy district. It brought to 39 the number of
slain youths found in the area in two days. Those found Thursday
had been beheaded or fatally shot, then dumped on a university
campus.
   Military officials blamed pro-government vigilante groups for
both massacres.
   The slayings on Wednesday and Thursday were to avenge the death
of a volunteer soldier gunned down by two unidentified men on a
bicycle, the officials said on condition of anonyity. Edward
Nagahawatta, an assistant registrar at the university, was killed
inside the campus Wednesday, officials said.
   The country's eight universities were closed more than two years
ago because of student unrest. The government contends the campuses
are a stronghold of the People's Liberation Front, an extremist
Sinhalese group that advocates overthrowing the govenrment.
   Military officials said on condition of anonymity that the 21
victims were found today around the town of Kandy.
   Two bodies were discovered in the main bus terminal in Kandy, 15
were found in Gelioya village and the remaining four, in Mahiyawa
village, officials said.
   Elsewhere, five people were killed in southern Sri Lanka, the
govnerment said without elaboration.
   Human rights groups say the military and vigilante groups
routinely kill sympathizers of the Sinhalese militants. The
government denies the charge.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa called a meeting with opposition
parties last month to try to resolve ethnic differences dividing
the Indian Ocean island.
   The front refused to attend the peace conference and spurned a
temporary truce called last week by government forces. At least 80
people were killed during the six-day truce, which expired Tuesday.
   The front has rejected all peace offers from the government,
saying it wants Premadasa to resign because he came to power in
what they called fraduulent elections in December 1988.
   When it began its campaign in 1987, the Sinhalese front opposed
the government's peace overtures to Tamil separatists demanding an
independent homeland in the northeast. It also objected to the
Indian peacekeeping soldiers deployed in Sri Lanka to help
implement a peace treaty with Tamil guerrillas.
   The soldiers will be pulled out by Dec. 31, the Indian
government has said.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
died in the 6-year-old Tamil rebellion. Tamils say they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese in jobs and
education.
   The predominantly-Buddhist Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and control the government and military.
Tamils comprise 18 percent of the population.

<HEAD>State Estimates 150,000 Drive Illegally in Massachusetts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 300,000 Massachusetts motorists have had
their licenses suspended, and state officials estimate at least
half of those are continuing to drive illegally.
   The statistics have prompted the Registry of Motor Vehicles to
begin taking away the license plates of drivers caught behind the
wheel with suspended driving licenses, officials said.
   State Registrar Robert M. Hutchinson Jr. released the figures on
license suspensions during a news conference Thursday where he
defended the registry's decision to reinstate the driver's license
of a man charged with killing a 10-year-old girl while driving
drunk in New Hampshire on Sunday.
   Following the arrest of Peter Dushame of North Andover, the
registry said his license had been suspended and that he was
driving illegally when he allegedly hit Lacey Parker in Nashua.
   But Hutchinson said Thursday that Dushame had a valid license at
the time of the accident. He said either ``human or technical
error'' led authorities to believe initially that Dushame's license
was still under suspension.
   The registry suspended Dushame's license in March 1988 after
being notified by New Hampshire authorities that he had been
convicted of a serious motor vehicle offense there.
   Hutchinson declined to identify the offense, citing privacy laws.
   According to the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles,
Dushame's record includes two drunken driving convictions there
since 1986, the year that state began notifying Massachusetts
authorities of vehicle offenses committed in New Hampshire by
Massachusetts drivers.
   Hutchinson said the registry was aware of only one offense by
Dushame in New Hampshire. Dushame would have received a longer
suspension if the registry known of the other conviction, he said.
   Dushame's sister, Beth Davis, said he got his license back about
two months ago.
   Asked whether the registry acted properly by returning his
license, Hutchinson said, ``Based upon the law at the time, we
acted correctly, yes.''

<HEAD>District Attorney Finds No Sign of Criminality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district attorney says he has found no
indication of criminal conduct in the crash of a USAir jetliner
into the East River last month.
   The Boeing 737-400 skidded into the river after an aborted
takeoff from LaGuardia Airport Sept. 20, killing two passengers.
   ``So far, there's been no evidence of criminality,'' Queens
District Attorney John J. Santucci said Thursday, in what he
described as an interim report on his investigation of the wreck of
Flight 5050.
   The local probe into possible criminal negligence or vehicular
homicide is unusual. The National Transportation Safety Board is
charged with investigating airline accidents.
   Santucci said he wanted to consult with NTSB investigators and
speak to Capt. Michael W. Martin and First Officer Constantine
Kleissas before calling off his investigation. He also said he
wanted to listen to the cockpit voice recordings.
   The district attorney said interview with 25 witnesses failed to
substantiate a report that Martin was acting incoherently before
the flight and left the scene immediately after the accident.
   That report originated with the co-pilot, who has since
withdrawn the remark and apologized.
   Investigators found the pilot went to an airport lounge and then
to a hospital after the crash, Santucci said.
   The NTSB hasn't finished its probe. Shortly after the crash, a
board spokesman said the co-pilot reported he accidentally punched
a button that cut the throttle, and the pilot told officials he
aborted takeoff because he felt a vibration and the jet began to
veer.

<HEAD>Norway's Labor Government To Resign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIK A. WOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland's
government will step down next week rather than be ousted by a
right-wing coalition, a spokesman for the Labor Party leader
announced today.
   The announcement comes one month after her party suffered its
greatest postwar election defeat.
   Mrs. Brundtland's 3-year-old administration will be replaced by
the three-party right-wing coalition led by Jan P. Syse of the
Conservative Party.
   ``She will inform the Parliament on Oct. 12 and hand in the
government's resignation to King Olav on Friday the 13th,'' said
spokesman Arne Strand.
   The alliance said it was ready to call for a vote of
no-confidence on Oct. 24 if Mrs. Brundtland refused to resign.
   Labor will go ahead with plans to present its 1990 national
budget to the new 165-seat Parliament before resigning, Strand said.
   ``Mrs. Brundtland's Cabinet will serve as a caretaker government
over the weekend. On Monday, the way is open for a non-socialist
government,'' he said.
   Syse, 58, presented a basic platform for his non-socialist
minority coalition on Wednesday after two weeks of negotiations.
The three partners are working on distributing Cabinet posts.
   The vaguely worded platform papered over differences among the
new partners and increased doubts among analysts on whether the
alliance can last a full four-year term.
   The new government of the Conservative, Christian Democrat and
Center parties will have a precarious hold on power, controlling 62
of the 165 seats in parliament. It will have to rely on support
from the far-right 22-seat Party of Progress.
   Labor has 63 seats, and the Labor-allied Socialist Left party
has 17. There is one independent.
   On Wednesday Mrs. Brundtland called the non-socialist program
``unfit as government platform,'' and said it ignores difficult
questions.
   Progress Party chairman Carl I. Hagen, whose anti-socialist
party was shunned by the centrist partners, said he would vote
against Mrs. Brundtland, but would not pledge loyalty to the
coalition unless his party was a full partner.

<HEAD>Officials Say Mother Pushed Her Children Out Window</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIRGINIA BYRNE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mother who told her children ``God is waiting
for you'' pushed her 6-year-old daughter and 3-year-old son out a
10th-floor window, killing the girl and critically injuring the
boy, authorities said.
   Firefighters broke down the apartment door Thursday afternoon
just in time to stop the naked woman from pushing a 1-year-old
daughter through the window's protective bars, saving that child
and two others, said fire Lt. John Lane.
   ``She was mumbling `Mohammed, Elijah,' she was trying to move
the children along to the window to jump and she was going to jump
also,'' said Lane, one of the first rescuers to reach the apartment.
   ``She told the children, `God is waiting for you,' '' he said.
   Meenah Abdussalaam, 32, her daughter, Zainab, and son, Husein,
were taken to St. John's Episcopal Hospital.
   Zainab died of her injuries, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Uzo said.
   Husein was transferred to North Shore University Hospital in
neighboring Nassau County, where he was in extremely critical
condition late Thursday after surgery, hospital spokeswoman Carol
Hauptman said.
   The mother, who was unhurt, was being evaluated at St. John's.
Dr. Russell Beavers told reporters she ``seemed distant ... not
cognizant of what was going on.''
   Mrs. Abdussalaam was charged early today with murder, attempted
murder and endangering the welfare of children, said Sgt. Pete
Berry, a police spokesman.
   Firefighters who happened to be passing by and saw the first
child fall forced their way into a barricaded bedroom and found the
mother and three children: 1-year-old Amna, her 8-year-old brother,
Askia, and 4-year-old sister, Fatima. All were naked.
   Police managed to grab the mother as she was sliding Amna out
between the window bars.
   Lane said Mrs. Abdussalaam punched the firefighter who broke
down the bedroom door.
   Neighbors described Mrs. Abdussalaam as quiet and polite, a good
mother and devout Moslem whose husband had recently moved out. Some
said her husband left her; others said she kicked him out.
   The husband, Sultan Abdussalaam, 35, was at work at the time of
the incident, police said.
   The three uninjured children were turned over to city welfare
workers.
   Police said Mrs. Abdussalaam had been notified she would be
evicted from her five-room apartment, which is in a federally
subsidized building in a middle-class neighborhood.
   Building superintendent Kevin Rafferty denied the eviction
report but said Mrs. Abdussalaam had been notified her rent was 10
days overdue. He said the family lived in the building for 12 years
without incident.
   Ann Sessa, president of the building's tenant association, said
Mrs. Abdussalaam was ``very careful with the children,'' who were
always clean and polite.
   ``It was always, `Yes, Ma'am,' `No, Ma'am,''' Mrs. Sessa said.
   Firefighters were passing the building when they saw the girl
pushed from the window, department spokeswoman Efrain Parilla said.
   ``(They) saw one child, a girl, hanging by her hands from the
window ledge of the apartment. They started shouting, `Don't jump,'
and as they did so, they saw the child trying to get back on the
ledge,'' Parilla said. ``She lifted a leg and tried to get back on
the ledge, then the firefighters saw an arm come out of the window
and push the child away.''
   As the firefighters rushed up, they saw the boy hanging out the
same window, Lane recalled.
   ``We said `Oh God, don't jump, we're here, we want to help
you,'' said the 28-year veteran firefighter, his voice shaking with
emotion.
   Firefighters stretched out their hands and partially broke the
boy's fall, said Lucy Bartholomew, who lives directly beneath the
Abdussalaams' apartment.

<HEAD>Kaifu Assured Of Two More Years As Ruling Party President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister and governing party president
Toshiki Kaifu, in office less than two months, was assured of two
more years as the Liberal Democratic chief when he registered as
the only candidate for the post.
   No other Liberal Democrats filed papers to oppose Kaifu's
candidacy by today's 11 a.m. deadline, said Seisuke Okuno, head of
the party's election management committee.
   Kaifu, 58, will be formally declared party president without
balloting at a party convention on Oct. 31, he said.
   He will remain prime minister as long as the Liberal Democrats
retain their majority in Parliament, or until his term as party
president expires in October 1991.
   Kaifu, in a policy statement attached to his application,
pledged to restore public trust in the party and promote political
reform.
   ``The serious objective of the party now is to make politics
trustworty for the public and stabilize the political situation,''
Kaifu said in a statement released today.
   He also called for a dialogue with communist bloc nations,
preserving the global environment and combating drug abuse.
   On Aug. 9, Kaifu became the party head and prime minister
because of the party's overwhelming majority in Parliament. He
replaced Sousuke Uno, who stepped down to take responsibility for
the party's poor showing in an election for the upper house of
Parliament.
   It was the first time the party lost control of a house of
Parliament in its 34 years.
   Uno resigned after only two months in office. He followed Noboru
Takeshita, who resigned June 2 because of links to a widespread
influence-peddling scandal.
   Although Kaifu has been in office less than two months, party
rules require the president to face another election when his
predecessor's term expires. Kaifu is currently serving the term
originally given to Takeshita, who was elected in November 1987.
   Although Kaifu was elected party president with a wide margin
over two candidates, he was seen as a short-term prime minister
because he was seen as neither possessing premier credentials nor
the political support to stay in power.
   Kaifu belongs to a small faction of his party, and has not held
top Cabinet or party posts _ credeitials generally required for the
premiership.
   The Liberal Democrats have been thrown into crisis following
bribery and sex scandals, as well as strong public opposition to a
new consumption tax.
   The Liberal Democrats face a severe challenge from opposition
parties in general elections for the more powerful Lower House,
which could come as early as next spring.

   An Episcopal priest says he'll be happy to
bless pets this weekend, but he's laid down some commandments for
owners.
   ``If you bring large animals, be prepared to clean up after
them,'' the Rev. Robert Chrisman said.
   Chrisman will bless animals at St. James Episcopal Church Sunday
for the feast of St. Francis. He said it's appropriate because St.
Francis is the patron saint of animals.
   ``God has given us these animals to care for,'' he said.
   According to a recent issue of the church bulletin, ``Father Bob
is experienced in blessing all sorts of animals,'' but asks that
dogs be on leashes and cats and smaller animals be in cages or
otherwise confined. He also specifies ``no poisonous reptiles,''
the bulletin said.
   The blessing will last about a half-hour, Chrisman said, and
will include a short scripture reading, prayers and ``a bit of
teaching, focusing on the care of animals.''

   Here are descriptions of principals in
the Jim Bakker fraud and conspiracy trial in U.S. District Court:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JIM BAKKER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bakker, a Michigan native, dropped out of North Central Bible
College in Minneapolis after less than one year of study to marry
schoolmate Tammy Faye LaValley. He began his ministry as a
traveling evangelist in the Assemblies of God and was ordained in
1964.
   Bakker was host of a Christian television show for children,
which led to a regular puppet show on Pat Robertson's Christian
Broadcast Network in Virginia. Bakker started ``The 700 Club'' on
CBN but left the network and eventually landed in Charlotte in 1974
with a Christian talk show on a UHF station.
   He built the single station into the PTL satellite network,
which grew to a $129 million a year empire, relocated his ministry
in Fort Mill, S.C., just outside Charlotte, and built Heritage USA,
a Christian theme park.
   Bakker resigned as PTL president in March 1987 after confessing
to a sexual encounter with New York church secretary Jessica Hahn.
He turned over PTL _ which stands for Praise The Lord or People
That Love _ to Jerry Falwell, who failed to keep it out of
bankruptcy court.
   He and his wife have two children, daughter Tammy Sue, who
married former PTL worker Doug Chapman in 1987, and son Jamie
Charles.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>TAMMY FAYE BAKKER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Tammy Bakker became her husband's partner on the CBN puppet show
and was his co-host on PTL. She and Bakker separated briefly in
1981, and their reconciliation led to PTL marriage workshops at
Heritage USA.
   She was treated for drug dependency in 1986 as an outpatient at
the Betty Ford Center after becoming addicted to tranquilizers.
   A self-professed chronic shopper, she was known for her
sprawling closets at the PTL parsonage and her heavy hand with
make-up. Although she received substantial bonuses at PTL, she was
not indicted with her husband.
   She is co-host of ``The Jim And Tammy Show,'' which originates
in a rundown mall in Orlando, Fla., and is carried on eight cable
channels.

<NOTE>RICHARD DORTCH</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Bakker's second-in-command at PTL, Dortch was a former district
superintendent for the Assemblies of God in Illinois and was
considered a top candidate to head the denomination.
   Dortch, who joined PTL in 1984, negotiated the $265,000 hush
payment to Jessica Hahn and was fired at PTL after Jerry Falwell
took over in 1987. He was indicted with Bakker, but pleaded guilty
to four counts of conspiracy and fraud three weeks before their
trial. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined
$200,000, but his sentence could be reconsidered after Bakker's
trial.
   He was defrocked by the Assemblies of God along with Bakker in
1987 and later moved to Florida, where he started a counseling
ministry for executives facing personal crises.

<NOTE>DAVID and JAMES TAGGART</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Detroit natives David and James Taggart, who both testified for
the prosecution at Bakker's trial, started as piano players with
PTL but soon moved up the ladder. David became Bakker's personal
assistant, handling travel arrangements and schedules, and served
as the bank for the PTL entourage whenever Bakker traveled. His
brother became PTL's interior designer.
   Prosecutors said the pair diverted more than $1 million in
ministry funds for their personal uses, including expensive
wardrobes, jewelry and a Manhattan apartment. They were convicted
in July of tax evasion. David was sentenced to 18 years, five
months and James to 17 years, nine months in prison. The brothers
were also fined $500,000 each.

   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller handled Bakker's case
through the grand jury and trial. He was joined by Deborah Smith, a
fraud expert with the U.S. Justice Department in Washington.

<NOTE>THE DEFENSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   George C. Davis, is a noted West Coast attorney whose clients
have included the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto of Pakistan
and Alfred Krupp, the German munitions manufacturer who was
convicted of war crimes at Nuremburg. Davis has been the defense
lawyer in more than 200 death penalty cases and was one of the
first lawyers to use hypnosis in a criminal trial.
   Harold Bender, Bakker's second lawyer, is a former assistant
U.S. attorney from Charlotte and has served as defense lawyer in
several highly publicized local cases.

<NOTE>U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE ROBERT POTTER</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A conservative judge nominated by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
Potter is known in courthouse circles as ``Maximum Bob.'' Potter
imposed a gag order on the case before it started, forbidding
anyone associated with the trial from discussing it outside the
courtroom. He frequently sparred with Davis during the trial,
warning him about his questions and comments before the jury.

   A state trooper convicted of raping a
motorist he stopped for a traffic violation faces up to 25 years in
prison.
   Robert O. Bennett Jr. was found guilty Thursday of first-degree
rape, two counts of first-degree sodomy, first-degree sexual abuse,
first-degree coercion, unlawful imprisonment and official
misconduct in the September 1988 incident.
   Saratoga County Judge Frank Williams scheduled sentencing for
Dec. 4. The eight-year veteran trooper could receive up to 25 years.
   Bennett, 36, of Halfmoon, was charged with attacking the woman,
a 30-year-old college professor, while patrolling I-87 in Saratoga
County.
   The woman testified that Bennett stopped her for an improper
lane change and erratic driving and took her to a wooded area and
raped her.
   She said she kept the incident secret until days later when she
called a Rape Crisis hotline. State police were eventually notified
and began an investigation.

   A 15-year-old honor student charged with
breaking into a defense contractor's computer system was described
by police as a hacker on a lark.
   ``He was having a gay old time of it,'' said Detective
Christopher Poppe of the Nassau County Forgery Squad. ``For kids as
bright as this one, getting into a system like Grumman is like a
football player scoring three touchdowns.''
   The high school student has been charged with delinquency for
computer tresspass in the computer system of Grumman Corp., an
aerospace company, police said. Police withheld the Levittown
teen-ager's name because he is a minor.
   When the boy was arrested Wednesday night, apologized and turned
over computer disks containing Grumman data he retrieved on his
$3,000 home computer.
   ``He was very remorseful,'' said Poppe, who said it didn't
appear the youth intended to do any damage. ``He knew he did
something wrong.''
   Grumman officials said the youth didn't get any classified or
sensitive information during his month of access to the company's
engineering minicomputer system.
   The teen-ager, a student at Division Avenue High School and
member of the National Honor Society, got information on Grumman
computer procedures and a list of passwords for people with higher
clearances.
   The electronic break-in happened when the computer system's
security devices were shut off for testing, said Grumman spokesman
Robert Harwood.
   ``He didn't do any damage, but this is just not acceptable
behavior in a civilized society,'' Harwood said. ``It's like having
someone wander around in your living room.''

<TEXT>
   Masked gunmen today kidnapped two Swiss
Red Cross employees who worked distributing artificial limbs to
victims of Lebanon's civil war and drove them to a Palestinian
refugee camp, police said.
   The two workers were seized when they arrived at a Red Cross
center outside this port 25 miles south of Beirut, police said.
   Officials at the Geneva headquarters of the International
Committee of the Red Cross condemned the kidnapping, which comes 11
months after the abduction of another Swiss Red Cross worker in
Sidon.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A Sunni Moslem
militia leader indicated a radical Palestinian group was involved.
   Police and the Red Cross identified the victims as Emmanuel
Christen, 32, and Elio Erriquez, 23, and said both worked as
orthopedic technicians at the Red Cross center, which distributed
the artificial limbs to victims of the 14-year-old civil war.
   The Red Cross pulled all its 31 Swiss delegates from Lebanon on
Dec. 20 after the abduction of Peter Winkler, a Red Cross official
in Sidon. The Swiss man was kidnapped Nov. 17, 1988 and released
Dec. 16.
   News reports in Switzerland and Lebanon said at the time that
Winkler's kidnappers threatened new anti-Swiss attacks, claiming
the Red Cross and Swiss authorities reneged on a pledge to pay
ransom for Winkler's freedom.
   The Red Cross mission returned to Lebanon Jan. 22 after all
parties in Lebanon pledged it would not be attacked.
   The assailants today, wearing black masks, were waiting in two
cars at the entrance of the center near the Ein el-Hilweh refugee
camp when the relief workers' white Peugeot car arrived, police
reported.
   ``Christen parked the car at the center's parking lot and
climbed out, holding an artificial limb. Erriquez got out from the
car's opposite door, followed by a Lebanese ICRC employee,'' a
police spokesman said.
   Two men immediately leaped out of a dark-colored Mercedes, one
with a pistol and the other a machine gun trained at the Red Cross
men, said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   ``Christen and Erriquez immediately threw their arms up,
offering no resistance. They were bundled at gunpoint into the
trunk of the Mercedes, which sped off followed by the other car,
loaded with armed guards,'' the spokesman said. The spokesman said
the two cars headed in the direction of the camp.
   The abduction was the latest in a chain that targeted relief
workers with foreign humanitarian organizations in south Lebanon.
   Police blamed most of the previous kidnappings in southern
Lebanon on the Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the radical Palestinian
guerrilla group headed by terrorist Abu Nidal. Abu Nidal is the nom
de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, a former official in Yasser Arafat's
mainstream Fatah movement who split with the Palestine Liberation
Organization leader in 1973.
   Sidon houses the teeming Palestinian refugee camp of Ein
el-Hilweh and the nearby town of Mieh Mieh, where Abu Nidal's group
maintains bases.
   Mustafa Saad, commander of the Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia
that has governed Sidon since the outbreak of Lebanon's civil war
in 1975, pointed an accusing finger at the Palestinians.
   ``This is an Ein el-Hilweh affair, not mine,'' Saad told
reporters after a 10-minute meeting at his house with Red Cross'
south Lebanon chief delegate, Roland Sidler. Sidler would not speak
with reporters.
   In Geneva, Red Cross spokesman Joerg Bischof said the abductions
came as ``a surprise'' following the assurance by Lebanese groups
that Red Cross workers wouldn't be attacked.
   ``We condemn that humanitarian workers who bring assistance to a
country at war are kidnapped, because it hinders a very important
work the Red Cross is doing in Lebanon,'' Bischof said.
   Apart from the two Swiss abducted today, 16 Westerners,
including eight Americans, are held hostage in Lebanon.
   Most of them are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist
factions. The longest held is American journalist Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   In Beirut today, Irish Ambassador Patrick McCabe appealed for
information about Irish hostage Brian Keenan, who turned 39 in
captivity two weeks ago.
   McCabe, who is ambassador to both Lebanon and Iraq and based in
Baghdad, came to Beirut early this week. He held meetings with
commanders of the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon before
conferring with Lebanese Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Farouk
Abilamaa in Christian east Beirut.

   President F.W. de Klerk today
agreed to meet with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and two other
church anti-apartheid leaders next week for unprecedented talks
about South Africa's racial conflict.
   De Klerk immediately agreed to a request by the church leaders
for urgent talks ``about the crisis in our land,'' the president's
office said.
   It will be de Klerk's first direct meeting with top
anti-apartheid leaders since he replaced P.W. Botha as president
Aug. 15. The meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday in Pretoria.
   Tutu, who was in the United States today, released a statement
through his office in Cape Town saying he and his colleagues
believe de Klerk ``does not appreciate the far-reaching nature of
the steps he must take to get negotiations off the ground'' between
blacks and government leaders.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five
years that would extend political rights to the disenfranchised
black majority, but he has ruled out participation by the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement unless it renounces
violence.
   Tutu, referring to this position, said: ``Negotiations which
exclude the legitimate leaders of our people, which the government
appears to be contemplating, will intensify, not resolve, our
country's crisis.''
   ``It is not our intention to go to Mr. de Klerk claiming to be
negotiators,'' Tutu said. ``As church leaders, we would see
ourselves as facilitators who would try to create the climate for
negotiations.''
   The actual negotiations, he said, ``would have to be entered
into by those identified by our people as their true political
leaders.''
   In addition to Tutu, the clergymen who requested the meeting
were the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, and the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of
the South African Council of Churches, de Klerk's office said.
   Tutu, expected back in South Africa on Sunday after traveling to
Washington for the funeral of Episcopal Bishop John T. Walker, met
four times with Botha during the former president's 11 years in
power. The archbishop has not met with de Klerk since Botha's
resignation in August.
   Government sources have been quoted in news reports this week as
saying jailed ANC leader Walter Sisulu and another prominent black
activist, Oscar Mpetha, will be freed by Oct. 18.
   Sisulu, 77, the outlawed group's general secretary, was
sentenced in 1964 along with Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders
to life in prison for plotting anti-government sabotage.

<HEAD>Colombian Pressure Forcing Out Huge Shipments of Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Colombian government is forcing cocaine
cartels to hustle out large stockpiles, and the United States is
taking advantage of the chaos to seize huge shipments, a federal
official said.
   ``We're seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaine's
moving out, because it's not safe to leave it in Colombia any
more,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Thursday.
   The 35 tons of cocaine seized during the past week in
California, Texas and Louisiana is a clear indication that the war
on drugs is working, he said.
   Skinner spoke beside the Zedom Sea, a rusty, 185-foot former
offshore supply boat seized Monday by the Coast Guard in the Gulf
of Mexico. It was carrying more than six tons of cocaine worth more
an estimated $500 million.
   The ship was escorted to New Orleans on Thursday, and the crew
of nine Colombians was turned over to the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
   The eight men and one woman were arraigned on charges of
importing cocaine and possession with intent to distribute cocaine
and ordered held without bond. The charges carry a possible maximum
penalty of life in prison.
   DEA spokesman Billy Fernandes said the cocaine found aboard the
Zedom Sea totaled 12,208 pounds, or slightly more than six tons,
and had a street value of more than $550 million. Earlier,
officials had estimated the amount seized at about 5{ tons.
   The seizure was one of three major finds in less than a week.
   Texas state troopers found nine tons of the drug Wednesday in
Harlingen, stacked in a house believed to be a center for
repackaging cocaine after its arrival in the United States. Agents
continued to look for the owner of the house; three Mexican
citizens at the scene were arraigned Thursday on charges of
engaging in organized criminal activity and aggravated cocaine
possession.
   About 20 tons were found late last week in a Los Angeles
warehouse _ the world's largest seizure.
   The Gulf seizure, along with about 3,000 to 3,500 pounds seized
near Puerto Rico over the weekend, brings the Coast Guard's total
take in the first four days of fiscal 1990 to more than the Coast
Guard seized in all of the previous fiscal year, officials said.
   ``It is not business as usual in the drug business today,'' said
Skinner. Pressure by the Colombian government since a leading
presidential candidate was assassinated in August is ``creating
what I'd call chaos. And we're taking advantage of that, and we're
seizing cocaine that otherwise would have been transmitted in
smaller groups and probably would not have been detected.''
   Most of the cocaine on the Zedom Sea was found in two of 10
boxcar-sized freight containers on the deck, said Ruben Monzon,
special agent in charge of the DEA's New Orleans office.

<HEAD>Thousands Attend Funeral of Jewish Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people today attended the
funeral of a Jewish leader who was gunned down in Brussels, and an
unknown group claimed responsibility for the slaying in the name of
a ``free Palestine.''
   Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens and Justice Minister Melchior
Wathelet were among those paying their last respects to Dr. Joseph
Wybran, the head of Belgium's Jewish community.
   Wybran, 49, was shot Tuesday evening outside the Brussels
University Hospital, where he headed the immunology department. He
died early Wednesday of a gunshot wound to the head.
   In a letter to several newspapers, a group calling itself
``Young Palestine, Proud and Free,'' claimed responsibility for the
shooting and said more attacks would follow.
   ``Our demands are simple: a free Palestine for a free people.
The first victim was Wybran,'' the letter said. The group said it
was made up of ``young revolutionaries, trained and supported by
the PLO.''
   Shawqi Armali, a Palestine Liberation Organization
representative in Brussels, denied any knowledge of the group and
condemned the killing.
   It was the second claim of responsibility for Wybran's slaying.
   On Thursday, an underground group in Lebanon calling itself
Soldiers of Justice said it killed Wybran and claimed he was a spy
for Israel.
   Police have reported no progress in their search for the killer
of Wybran, who recently campaigned for the removal of an order of
Roman Catholic nuns from the grounds of the former Auschwitz
concentration camp in Poland.

<HEAD>South Carolina's Damage Estimates Revised Upward; Charleston Recovering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although damage estimates in the wake of
Hurricane Hugo were hiked upward to more than $4 billion, the
return of carriage rides and parking tickets are signs that
historic Charleston is trying to get back to normal.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city had made an ``absolutely
remarkable'' recovery in two weeks since the hurricane lashed the
city with its 135 mph winds.
   ``The city is open, the curfew is over and we invite the people
of the state and the country to come to Charleston,'' Riley said.
But he noted that the recovery will take longer for those who lost
homes, possessions or jobs in the hurricane.
   Horse-drawn carriages were to be back on the streets this
weekend and the city will start ticketing parking violators on
Monday, the mayor said.
   Meanwhile, the Ben Sawyer Bridge _ the only link between the
mainland and the Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island about 10 miles
north of Charleston _ is back in place, said Carol Todd,
spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers.
   She said the corps finished its work about 2 a.m. today, but
that she does not know when the swing bridge will open to traffic.
Officials from the state Highway Department were inspecting the
bridge this morning, she said.
   The bridge _ one end of which was submerged in the Intracoastal
Waterway by Hugo's winds _ was lifted onto barges Wednesday. But a
broken cable prevented the barges from positioning the bridge back
on the road before today.
   Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead in South
Carolina, and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schools
and municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.
mainland and at least 33 in the Caribbean.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said Thursday that damage from the storm
was revised upward to $4 billion to $5 billion. Previous estimates
had been closer to $3 billion.
   State and local governments would pick up about 25 percent of
the $200 million cleanup cost with the federal government covering
the rest.
   The state highway commission suggested a 1-cent increase in the
gasoline tax to help pay for the cleanup, but Campbell said he
would first shift funds from other programs before increasing taxes.
   Riley, who had asked Campbell to request Army troops to help
clear debris, said Thursday he wrote to President Bush himself when
the governor rejected the idea.
   In a letter to Campbell, Riley and two other mayors said the
state has been inundated with as much debris as one might expect to
collect over 50 years. They said private contractors could not meet
the cleanup demand and local governments couldn't afford to pay
them.
   But Campbell said the cities can still contract with private
contractors and would have to pay 12 percent of the cost.
   Also Thursday, National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets
said damage from the storm could have been halved had coastal
structures been built to the tougher hurricane building codes of
south Florida.
   ``The extent of the damage is far more widespread than I've seen
from any previous hurricane,'' said Sheets, in the state to tour
storm damage.
   Workers used bulldozers to rebuild dunes along beaches scarred
by the hurricane. Private contractors were supported by 550 Army
troops and Marines using 100 dump trucks to haul sand to build up
eight miles of beach in Myrtle Beach.
   Tides at least 2 feet above normal are expected along the coast
from Oct. 14-18 caused by the moon coming unusually close to the
Earth, said Ms. Todd.
   Campbell hopes to have 65 miles of dunes rebuilt along the
state's northern coastline before the high tides hit.

   Nearly two dozen Colombian security
officials have received 14 days' specialized instruction in the
United States on survival training and court security to help their
country battle cocaine cartels.
   The training session at the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center was held by the U.S. Marshals Service at the request of the
State Department. The Colombian government had requested help in
training employees who protect judges and others in the judicial
system.
   Twenty-three Colombians from several ``policing'' agencies
received instruction in court security, personal protection and
survival training at the center before returning to Colombia on
Saturday, said Frank Skroski, deputy chief of training for the
Marshals Service.
   ``We modified our program to accommodate their specific needs,''
Skroski said. ``They were a very serious group, and they worked
long and hard.''
   He said although there are similar training programs conducted
across the country by the State Department, this site was ideal for
the Colombians because it had Spanish-speaking instructors.
   Cocaine cartels have been blamed for the deaths of at least 220
Colombian judges, politicians and other officials who have tried to
crack down on the drug trade in recent years.
   When the Colombian goverment this summer began a renewed cocaine
crackdown in conjunction with the United States, drug barons
threatened to kill 10 judges for every suspected drug dealer
extradited to the United States for trial.
   President Bush supported the crackdown, which began in August
after a leading presidential candidate was assassinated, by issuing
a $65 million military emergency aid package for the country,
including bulletproof vests, combat helicopters and grenade
launchers.
   A $2 million program to aid Colombian judges and others
threatened by cartel hit men was also announced by Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh.

   The following is a chronology of the major events
leading up to and following the founding of the East German state
40 years ago:
   May 1945: Nazi Germany surrenders unconditionally to Allied
forces. Germany is divided into zones occupied by the victorious
allied powers. The region that is now East Germany comes under the
jurisdiction of the Soviet Union.
   April 1946: The East German Communist Party becomes the
governing political force in the country. Its leaders come from the
anti-Hitler communist resistance members who were imprisoned or
exiled.
   May 1949: The Allied powers form a new German state, the Federal
Republic of Germany, or West Germany.
   Oct. 7, 1949: The German Democratic Republic, or East Germany,
is officially founded as an independent state in the Soviet zone of
occupation.
   Oct. 10, 1949: The Soviet military administration transfers all
administrative powers to the new communist government.
   June 17, 1953: East German workers unhappy with poor pay,
increased working hours and government oppression stage revolts in
several East German cities. The uprising is put down with the help
of Soviet tanks, and now described in official East German
histories as an ``attempted counterrevolutionary coup.''
   Aug. 13, 1961: Faced with a record exodus of highly skilled East
German workers, the government begins erecting the Berlin Wall and
seals the border with West Germany. The government justifies the
action by saying hostile capitalist forces were attempting to
plunder East Germany and that espionage and terrorist organizations
were operating out of West Berlin.
   May 1971: Erich Honecker becomes first secretary of the
Communist Party.
   Dec. 21, 1972: East Germany and West Germany sign a treaty to
improve inter-German relations and to ease travel between the two
countries.
   Sept. 18, 1973: East Germany becomes a member of the United
Nations.
   September 1974: The United States and East Germany establish
diplomatic relations, bringing to 100 the number of countries with
which East Germany has official relations.
   Sept. 7, 1987: Honecker becomes the first East German leader to
pay an official visit to West Germany.
   August and September 1989: Tens of thousands of East Germans
seeking passage to West Germany begin pouring into West German
embassies in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Sept. 10, 1989: The exodus begins as Hungary agrees to open its
borders to East German citizens.
   Sept. 30, 1989: East and West Germany agree that refugees holed
up at the West German embassies in Prague and Warsaw will be
allowed to leave for the West, following thousands who left when
Hungary opened its border. More than 45,000 East Germans arrive in
West Germany by early October.
   Oct. 4, 1989: About 10,000 would-be emigrants clash with riot
police in Dresden, followed by another demonstration one day later.
   Oct. 6-7, 1989: East Germany holds celebrations marking its 40th
anniversary in ceremonies overshadowed by the refugee exodus. The
hard-line government rejects the need for democratic reforms.

<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is
encountering stiff resistance to his plan to store radioactive
waste from a Colorado nuclear weapons plant in several states until
a permanent dump is completed in 1990 or 1991.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., was meeting today with Watkins' top
adviser on waste, Leo Duffy, to reinforce his state's opposition to
accepting waste at the Hanford nuclear weapons site near Richland,
which already is the most polluted arms plant in the nation.
   Nevada Gov. Bob Miller said he had tried unsuccessfully Thursday
to reach Watkins by telephone to tell him: ``We wouldn't accept
this waste under these circumstances.''
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said in a statement today, ``Don't
even ask'' Nevada to take any of the waste.
   In congressional testimony Thursday, Watkins said he anticipated
a tough battle.
   ``People are going to say, `Not in MY state,''' Watkins said.
   The retired admiral suggested he would propose in a private
meeting next week with state governors that seven states share the
waste-storage burden in the interest of keeping the crucial Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant operating.
   Watkins told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee a
permanent waste repository in New Mexico would not be ready to open
by March, when Colorado's unilaterally imposed waste storage limit
is expected to be reached.
   Thus, temporary storage sites must be found by March 1 or Rocky
Flats could be forced to close. The 364-acre plant near Denver is a
vital link in the nation's nuclear arms complex because it is the
only maker of plutonium triggers for warheads.
   Watkins said he had not decided which states to approach. The
most likely candidates include Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Nevada
and Washington, which have some of the department's main weapons
facilities. The two other nearest states with nuclear weapons sites
are Texas and California.
   Radioactive waste equivalent to 49 boxcar loads _ about 4,900
cubic yards _ would have to find temporary storage over the next
two years, he said. The amount could be even greater if further
delays are encountered in completing the Waste Isolation Pilot
Project near Carlsbad, N.M.
   The New Mexico repository was scheduled to open a year ago but
has been hampered by a series of environmental, technical and
regulatory problems.
   Watkins said he expected the problem of finding a temporary
storage site for Rocky Flats waste to become ``a very contentious
issue.''
   Eddie Binder, a spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers,
said the governor's position had not changed.
   ``There's no way I'll accept any other waste than what is
already in this state for temporary storage,'' Carruthers said two
weeks ago.
   The waste is contaminated with plutonium, which remains
radioactive for 240,000 years, and is generated at the Rocky Flats
weapons plant. The plant recovers plutonium from retired nuclear
weapons and reprocesses it to make triggers for new ones.
   Idaho had been storing part of the Rocky Flats waste, but Gov.
Cecil Andrus closed his state's borders Sept. 1 to further
shipments to protest the Energy Department's failure to open the
$800 million Waste Isolation Pilot Project.
   Watkins said he had received a letter from Washington Gov. Booth
Gardner that said, in essence, ``Don't look my way.'' He added
later, however, that he had received ``some informal indications''
from unspecified states that they might consider dropping their
opposition if a multi-state agreement was reached to spread the
waste burden.
   On a related subject, an Energy Department study released
Thursday concluded that Rocky Flats, which is under investigation
by the FBI for possible criminal violation of environmental laws,
poses no imminent threat to public health.
   The report raised doubts, however, about the accuracy of
measured concentrations of plutonium in the air surrounding the
complex. It said the air samplers were out-of-date, prone to
breakdowns and not properly located.

<HEAD>Declining Revenues in Some States Seen Posing National Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Declining tax revenues in Northeastern states
may spell economic trouble for the nation as a whole, state
officials said today.
   ``Growth of the national economy has helped the fiscal condition
of many states,'' said Raymond G. Scheppach, executive director of
the National Governors' Association.
   ``But at the same time, spending pressures on the states have
continued to build,'' he said, citing increased costs from
congressional action on catastrophic illness insurance, Medicaid
and other programs.
   Scheppach said many states closed out fiscal 1989 with ending
balances higher than the previous year's, because they anticipated
economic slowdowns that did not occur.
   Scheppach spoke at a news conference as the governors'
association and the National Association of State Budget Officers
released their annual fiscal survey of the states.
   The survey reported that total state ending balances in fiscal
1989 were higher than in 1988.
   It also showed, however, that many Northeastern states _ often
an index of trends in the national economy _ reported declining
ending balances in 1989 and revenues below estimates.
   ``The rapid decline in revenues in these states could portend
downturns in other states,'' the two groups said.
   Scheppach said early indications from several Northeastern
states is that they are ``seeing no revenue growth at all'' in the
first three months of fiscal 1990.
   The fiscal year ends on June 30 in 46 states. It ends on March
31 in New York, on Aug. 31 in Texas and on Sept. 30 in Michigan and
Alabama.

   General Electric Co. has paid $4,700 to five
farmers whose fall harvests turned up parts of a jetliner that
crashed at Sioux City, but a $50,000 bounty remains for the part
most sought by investigators.
   ``The harvest is in full swing right now, and they're getting
crops out, and they're able to see where they haven't been able to
see before,'' Buena Vista County Sheriff Chuck Eddy said.
   Officials of the National Transportation Safety Board and GE
hope missing parts will provide clues to why United Airlines Flight
232 crashed July 29. The crash killed 112 people, but 184 survived.
   Most of the parts turned in, including three this week, appear
to be engine fan blades or pieces of blades, said Stephen Gadd, a
lawyer representing GE. The company made the CF6-6 tail engine that
disintegrated before the crash.
   Many other pieces of engine were found immediately after the
July 19 crash.
   Still missing is the 300-pound titanium disk that held the
blades. The company is offering $278,000 in rewards for the parts,
ranging from a $500 minimum to $50,000 for the disk, and has paid
$4,700, Gadd said.
   Investigators suspect the disk failed, causing the engine to fly
apart over western Iowa. A bit of metal from the disintegrating
engine severed hydraulic lines, causing the pilots to lose control,
they believe.
   The Chicago-bound plane crashed during an attempted emergency
landing after turning back to Sioux City, about 50 miles from here.
   Farmer John Husman found what appeared to be part of a fan blade
while running a combine through his soybean field about six miles
north of Alta.
   ``It was pretty well mashed up,'' he said. ``It looked like it
must have gone through an awfully big force.''
   Husman said he found the part last Friday, but continued to
harvest his crop until rain idled him on Thursday. He said the
reward money is appreciated.
   ``That would make up for some of the repair bills on the
combine,'' he said.

   Donald Trump's $7 billion buyout bid for American
Airlines has been greeted with skepticism by analysts who wonder if
the billionaire developer is really looking for a quick buck
through stock plays.
   ``That seems to be a popular question,'' said Robert Decker, an
analyst for the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., after
American's parent company, AMR Corp., revealed Trump's proposal
Thursday.
   Trump wrote AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall, offering $120 for
each of the 58.9 million shares of stock in the nation's largest
airline.
   The deal would be the biggest airline takeover ever.
   Shares in Fort Worth-based AMR closed $16.87{ higher at $99.87{
in heavy trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. Other
airline stocks also jumped in related speculation. AMR advanced
further this morning to $103.25 in heavy trading, but that was
still well below Trump's offering price.
   Some in government, concerned about high debt levels in the
industry brought on by buyouts, viewed the deal unfavorably.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, a member of the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation, called for the immediate
adoption of legislation approved by the committee Thursday that
would require Department of Transportation approval of airline
takeovers.
   Others called for the Justice Department to review the deal for
antitrust violations because of Trump's purchase in June of Eastern
Airlines' Northeast shuttle, since renamed the Trump Shuttle.
   The AMR bid followed weeks of speculation about airline
takeovers, much of it centered on profitable American, which has
about 22 percent of the domestic market.
   Trump said his offer would expire Oct. 20. AMR said it would
consider the proposal ``in due course.''
   But the airline added: ``There has been no change in (AMR's)
policy and belief that AMR and its shareholders will be best served
by AMR remaining an independent company and continuing the strong
partnership among American Airlines, its employees, the communities
it serves and the public.''
   Analysts said the company's response could involve selling
assets, including jets or its computer reservations system, or
searching for a friendly buyer to compete with Trump.
   Trump said he was prepared to put up at least $1 billion in
equity.
   Some of the concern over recent airline takeovers has focused on
foreign participation. Susan Heilbron, executive vice president of
the Trump Organization, said Trump has no foreign partners in the
bid.
   Trump has accumulated stock in companies and suggested he
planned takeovers, only to sell out at a profit after the price
rose on ensuing takeover speculation or when another bidder
emerged, analysts noted.
   ``I think Wall Street is skeptical,'' said analyst Kevin Burke,
who follows airlines for First Union Corp., a bank holding company
in Charlotte, N.C.
   ``One reason is Trump's history,'' he said. ``He has a history
of coming off better off in these deals'' than if the buyout had
gone through.
   Besides the Eastern shuttle, which he bought for $365 million,
Trump's empire consists of huge real estate holdings that include
hotels, office buildings and Atlantic City, N.J., casinos.
   The recent wave of airline takeovers includes the $3.65 billion
buyout of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. and pending $6.75
billion employee-management takeover of United Airlines parent UAL
Corp.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has denied Randall Dale Adams' request to
clear state records of his 1977 capital murder conviction, which
was thrown out after the movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' cast doubt on
the evidence.
   Judge Larry Baraka said he denied the motion Thursday because
Adams' attorneys did not prove that he was wrongfully indicted.
   ``We don't know if he did or didn't do it,'' Baraka said.
   Adams spent 12 years in prison after being convicted of the 1976
fatal shooting of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. The jury had
recommended Adams be put to death, but the sentence later was
commuted to life.
   Earlier this year, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered a
new trial for Adams after reviewing evidence mostly obtained
through Errol Morris, producer of the documentary movie.
   Adams had maintained his innocence and said the real killer was
David Ray Harris, who had provided investigators with clues that he
said linked Adams to the slaying. Harris withdrew his accusation in
a court hearing last year and provided so many details about the
case that Baraka declared his statements a virtual admission of
guilt.
   After the appeals court ruling, Dallas County District Attorney
John Vance dismissed the capital murder charge against Adams,
saying his office lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute Adams,
who now lives in Ohio. But erasing any record of the conviction
required a separate ruling.
   Adams' attorney, George Preston, said he probably will file a
motion for a new trial asking Baraka to reconsider.
   ``Right now, if he were even stopped on a traffic violation, his
arrest, charge and conviction of capital murder would be accessible
by the officer,'' Preston said.

<HEAD>State Department Denying Fleeing East Germans Entry to US Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germans hoping to flee to the West are
``politely denied entry'' to the U.S. Embassy In East Berlin and
only those who have normal business there are permitted to enter,
the State Department says.
   A press notice issued Thursday night reinforced earlier U.S.
statements that the embassy is not equipped to grant waves of
would-be emigrants extended sanctuary.
   ``Our embassy is not in a position to accommodate large numbers
of people who want to sit there until other governments do
something,'' said Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman.
   Eighteen East Germans _ 10 adults and eight children _
voluntarily left the U.S. Embassy Wednesday evening after a 31-hour
occupation that touched off an effort by dozens of others to try to
get past East German police and into the building.
   Boucher said the East German government had given assurances
that ``their desire to emigrate would be considered positively and
that no reprisals would be taken against them.'' Also, he said, a
woman pushed away by police from the entrance was given similar
assurances.
   ``We try to do what we can to express our humanitarian concerns
for individuals as well as whole groups of people,'' the U.S.
spokesman said.
   But while asserting again American support for the right to
travel, Boucher said it was ``worth remembering'' that the vast
majority of East Germans trying to emigrate wish to settle in West
Germany, and not the United States.
   ``The embassy that we have in Berlin is, of course, not set up
as a place where people can go,'' Boucher said. ``We do not have
the capability to handle even a limited number of people.''
   The U.S. official also cautioned would-be East German emigrants
that ``people potentially put themselves in a difficult situation
with respect to their own government.''
   Boucher said the advice was based on recent statements by the
East German government that flocking to Western embassies ``was no
longer acceptable.''
   The notice to the press Thursday night said visitors to the
embassy were asked by U.S. officials why they wanted to enter the
building.
   ``Those who have normal embassy business are allowed to enter,''
it said. ``Those who do not are informed that the U.S. is unable to
assist them on other types of matters. They are politely denied
entry. No one is forced from embassy premises.''
   When hundreds of East Germans tried to rush the five-story stone
building in downtown East Berlin on Wednesday the doors were
slammed shut and East German police called in reinforcements. About
100 formed a line in front of the embassy.
   Boucher said the fact that thousands of East Germans are trying
to flee ``relfects a deep sense of dissatisfaction'' with their
government.
   He said the police were not requested by U.S. embassy officials.
``We deplore the manhandling of the crowd,'' the spokesman said.
``And the embassy has protested the stopping of people trying to
visit it.''

<HEAD>Cambodian Rebels Say Moscow Sending Huge Arms Shipments to Phnom
Penh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow has doubled the pace of its arms
shipments to Cambodia this year, sending 60 tanks and 20 MiG-21 jet
fighters in August alone, the resistance coalition and Asian
diplomats said today.
   The Soviet Union began shipping huge quantities of munitions to
Phnom Penh when it became clear that Vietnam's troops would be
withdrawn by the end of September, the officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Moscow sent 160 T-55 main battle tanks this year, more than
doubling Phnom Penh's inventory of tanks.
   The Soviets also sent at least 36 Mig-21 fighter jets, 76.2mm
heavy artillery, trucks, thousands of tons of land mines, small
arms and ammunition to the port at Kampong Saom, diplomats said.
   Soviet deliveries of munitions through the end of August are
running about twice as high as the pace of shipments in 1988, the
diplomats said.
   The information on shipments came from the Cambodian resistance
movement's sources, U.S. intelligence and independent media
reports, they said.
   An official at the Soviet Union's U.N. Mission, speaking
privately, said he did not think that the pace of Soviet arms
deliveries had increased this year.
   In Cambodia and Afghanistan, governments backed by Moscow have
lost the protection of armies from powerful neighbors and now face
determined, well-trained guerrilla movements.
   Moscow greatly increased the quantity and quality of munitions
it sent to Afghanistan after Soviet troops completed their
withdrawal earlier this year.
   Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, Nguyen Dy Nien, recently told
the General Assembly: ``From this rostrum, I solemnly declare that
from September 27 there does not remain a single Vietnamese
volunteer soldier in Cambodia, either army man, adviser or military
employee.'' Last week, a Cambodian resistance leader called
Vietnam's troop withdrawal a sham.
   Son Sann, the prime minister of the three-party resistance
coalition recognized by the United Nations as the legitimate
government of Cambodia, claimed Vietnam left behind at least 30,000
Vietnamese soldiers, 100,000 militiamen and a million settlers.
   China supplies weapons to the three members of the Cambodian
resistance coalition, including its strongest guerrilla army, the
Khmer Rouge, which ruled Cambodia from 1975 until ousted by Vietnam
in 1979.
   Led by Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge traumatized the nation by
attempting to impose a peasant agricultural economy on everyone in
the country. More than a million people died of starvation or were
executed during its reign.

<HEAD>Zaire's President Delivers Harvard Remarks Amid Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko defended his
human rights record in a news conference today after about 500
people protested during his speech at Harvard University the night
before.
   In his brief remarks, Mobutu also predicted a cease-fire
agreement would be signed this month to halt the civil war in
Angola. The agreement would replace the faltering June accord
between rebels and the Soviet-backed government, who have been
fighting for 14 years.
   ``The text is ready,'' he said.
   Mobutu, asked about reported human rights violations in Zaire,
said that after Belgium gave the central African country its
independence in 1959, conflicts among 24 political parties and
seven unions left a half-million people dead in six years. But
since he took power in 1965, he said, tribal and ethnic conflict
has eased.
   ``The results are clear,'' he said. ``There are no more deaths.''
   About 500 African-American activists, academics and others
chanted outside a university auditorium Thursday night during
Mobutu's speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government.
   For the past two weeks a coalition of activists tried to
persuade Harvard to rescind its invitation to the African leader,
who was asked to speak his part in the Angola peace effort.
   ``Harvard, like other universities, feels very strongly about
the right of free speech,'' Steven Singer, a spokesman for the
graduate school, said Thursday.
   Mobutu called for greater U.S. assistance in reducing Africa's
foreign debt. Zaire owes an estimated $7 billion to $8 billion to
overseas creditors.
   He defended his country's human rights record before a skeptical
audience of about 150 people, one of whom angered the African
leader during a question-and-answer session.
   The student, who said he was Zairian, accused Mobutu of
perpetuating a state of continued poverty and starvation in Zaire.
   Mobutu fired back: ``And you say in front of foreigners that
people starve to death in Zaire. What Zaire are you talking about?''
   Mobutu's opponents accuse him of taking power nearly 25 years
ago in a CIA-sponsored coup, trafficking in arms to rebels in
Angola and amassing a private fortune while impoverishing Zaire.
   On Wednesday, Mobutu met with President Bush and addressed the
United Nations in New York.

<TEXT>
   President Bush made a little history Friday
when he walked on to the Senate floor for a few seconds.
   Senate associate historian Don Ritchie said there's no record of
any sitting president making an informal visit to the floor,
although presidents have given formal addresses in the Senate
chamber.
   Normally, presidents speak in the larger House chamber to a
joint session of Congress.
   Bush decided to visit the floor after separate private meetings
with Senate Republicans and Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine. He walked through the door to a round of applause from the
handful of senators on the floor and the mostly empty spectator
gallery.
   The visit ended in less than a minute.
   Ritchie said Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford spoke in the Senate chamber during their presidencies.
Harry Truman and Ford visited the floor after their terms had ended.
   Truman had the chance to visit the floor the day after his April
12, 1945, elevation to the presidency. At the Capitol for a
meeting, Ritchie said Truman stood at the door of the chamber where
he previously served, but decided not to go in.

<TEXT>
   Thirteen nuns locked themselves into
their henhouse for three hours Friday to prevent health officials
from slaughtering their flock of 5,000 chickens.
   The chickens at the Our Lady of the Passion Monastery, 65 miles
northwest of London, were condemned to death by the Ministry of
Agriculture on Wednesday after a salmonella victim blamed them for
her food poisoning.
   An inspection found salmonella in the flock.
   But the nuns, led by American-born Mother Catherine, from
Erlanger, Ky., said the birds were well cared for and not connected
to any outbreak of salmonella poisoning.
   ``The strain that was found in our chickens has been in chickens
since 1913,'' Mother Catherine said Friday. ``No one has done
anything about it because there was no real danger. We will not
allow the chickens to be slaughtered.''
   Richard North, a spokesman for the nuns, said their action
prevented the slaughter. He added that the nuns relied entirely on
income from the sale of eggs and that if the chickens were killed,
the convent might have to close.
   ``They (the ministry officials) were formally and officially
refused entry and that was why the slaughter did not take place,''
said North.
   But ministry officials said they could not proceed because they
didn't have anywhere to dump the carcasses. They said they would
return.
   The United Kingdom Egg Producers Association supported the nuns.

   Police shot to death two black

in a black township near Durban, officials said Friday.
   Police were summoned after the youths attacked two private
security guards at a shop in KwaMashu on Thursday, a police

   Two of the youths were killed in a shootout, and clashes with
other members of the group occurred later in the day in other
sections of the township, police said. One officer reportedly was
injured by a stone.
   Police reported three other deaths in black-on-black violence in
Natal Province, where more than 2,000 people have been killed
during a three-year power struggle between militant anti-apartheid
groups and Inkatha, a more conservative Zulu political organization.
   Peace talks between the two factions have collapsed, and the
violence has worsened in recent weeks. Four Parliament members from
the anti-apartheid Democratic Party plan to meet with senior police
officials Tuesday to discuss the conflict.

   Anti-abortion lawyers told a federal judicial
panel today that the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in July to
reinstate a Louisiana law making nearly all abortions illegal.
   John Baker, a Louisiana State University law professor, told the
three U.S. District Court judges that the July 3 decision upholding
Missouri abortion restrictions changed the way abortion cases can
be reviewed by the court.
   That means Louisiana may ban abortions if it proves it has a
compelling interest in protecting the unborn, he said.
   Such an interest is already evident in state laws giving fetuses
the right to such things as support payments, said Baker and
Jennifer Schaye, a lawyer for state Attorney General William Guste.
   Rachael Pine, an attorney for the pro-choice side, said there is
no basis for lifting the 1976 federal court order that keeps
Louisiana from sending doctors to jail for performing abortions.
   She said all nine Supreme Court justices agreed that the
Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, does not
overturn Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling establishing a woman's right
to abortion.
   Pine disagreed with Baker's contention that Webster changed the
judicial standard for review of abortion cases and said the courts
still must bar any law that unduly restricts a woman's access to
abortion.
   ``If this law is not an undue burden on a woman's right, I don't
know what is,'' Pine said.
   Baker countered that he wasn't asking the court to overturn Roe
vs. Wade but simply to set up a test case to see if Louisiana's
interest in protecting the unborn would indeed be upheld by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   There was no indication when the judges will rule.
   Before the hearing, about 70 demonstrators on the courthouse
steps sang ``Keep abortion safe and legal'' to the tune of the
``Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' A dozen anti-abortion protesters
arrived later and walked quietly in a circle.
   New Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick spearheaded the
effort to revive the anti-abortion law shortly after the Supreme
Court ruled on the Missouri case. Guste joined the case later.
   The action brought immediate protest from the National
Organization for Women, the ACLU and other groups.
   ``Louisiana is a major battle ground,'' said Shirley Peddler,
director of Louisiana's ACLU chapter. ``It is the first state to
try to criminalize abortion, even without grounds to do so.''

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Communist leader urging termination

<TEXT>
   A top Communist leader today urged a
historic congress of his ruling party to effectively terminate its
70-year existence and start anew under a banner of democratic
values.
   Party Chairman Rezsoe Nyers also appealed to the 1,279 congress
delegates to rid the party of members opposed to sweeping change _
orthodox Marxists and centrists who want to tinker with the system
without scrapping it for a new one.
   ``The historic role of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party has
reached an end here,'' said Nyers, using the formal name of the
Communist Party in a keynote speech on the opening day of the
congress.
   ``It is my belief that the new party cannot be Communist,'' said
Nyers. He said the fledgling party should be a synthesis of the
Communist Party and European-style social democratic parties, with
a new name no longer mentioning ``Workers'' to reflect its broader
base.
   Nyers, a moderate reformer, occupies the middle of the political
spectrum among the four-man leadership. He echoed his more liberal
co-leaders Imre Pozsgay and Premier Miklos Nemeth in calling for
the removal of conservatives who cannot accept fundamental change.
   But Karoly Grosz, the most conservative member of the party
leadership, launched a veiled attack on Pozsgay and Nemeth, both of
whom have said they would rather see a party split than cooperate
with orthodox Marxists.
   Grosz said that alleged intolerance of unidentified party
leaders toward differing opinions was reminiscent of ``old
Stalinist practices, even if they're covered with the sweet glaze
of reformism.''
   The four-man leadership was formed in June in an attempt to
bridge growing ideological differences within the party.
   But the differing political persuasions of the leaders
themselves led to growing estrangement at the top, and Grosz
acknowledged major differences between him and his colleagues.
   He also directly contradicted Nyers, formally the senior leader,
saying the party should not give up Communist ideals and should
keep the word Workers in its name.
   Earlier, reformist Central Committee member Maria Ormos evoked
the memory of Imre Nagy, the executed political leader of the 1956
anti-Stalinist revolution who for more than three decades had been
branded a triator.
   In its new reformist drive, the party rehabilitated Nagy early
this year, hailing him as a forerunner of current change. Ms. Ormos
compared him to revered 19th century revolutionary leaders who
fought for greater democracy.
   Nothing less than the political direction of Hungary is under
discussion at the congress, which opened today and is scheduled to
end Sunday.
   The reformist leadership wants to move toward a multiparty
system and a market economy. Conservatives want a return to Marxist
orthodoxy.
   The opposing stances have meant a growing polarization within
the party.
   Conservatives say they will seek to oust reformist leaders,
reformists have called on supporters to cleanse the party of
conservatives, and just about the only issue both sides agree on is
the possibility of a party split.
   Communist leaders and the political opposition have agreed there
will be free elections by June but sentiment within the party
against far-reaching reform could doom such plans.
   At times in recent months Hungary has moved ahead of Poland _
the only Soviet bloc country not dominated by Communists _ in its
pace of reform. But unlike Hungary, Poland has been cautious not to
offend its hard-line Warsaw Pact partners.
   Hungary alienated three East Bloc allies _ East Germany, Romania
and Czechoslovakia _ with its liberal policies, including its
decision to allow East Germans free passage to the West.
   The orthodox Marxists are joining critics from abroad. They are
angry about a Central Committee draft manifesto that proposed a
radical change in the makeup of their Communist Party.
   The 20-page document, prepared for the congress, foresees a
``constitutional state based on a multiparty system, in which the
source of power is the will of the people, manifested at free
elections,'' and ``an efficient market economy.''
   Voting on the draft is a principal task of the 1,200 delegates,
but they also face other tough choices, such as electing party
leaders. A defeat of Pozsgay or Nyers would be a major setback for
the reformists.

<HEAD>National Indian Asylum's Legacy: Graves Amid a Golf Course</HEAD>

   A grassy plot of unmarked graves of Indians
who were consigned to an insane asylum early this century is
getting new attention amid a growing national reburial movement.
   Activists plan a traditional ceremony Saturday to promote
respect for the cemetery, long visited mostly by golfers who stray
from a surrounding course.
   ``Golfers forget the cemetery exists there,'' said Harold Iron
Shield, an organizer of the event. ``Sometimes their balls are
knocked into the cemetery. They either tee off there, or they walk
on the graves.''
   It is not difficult to miss the cemetery. The rectangular plot,
surrounded by hedges, has neither a fence nor a gate. A single
concrete monument lists the names of all the dead, but only two
graves have individual markers.
   About 120 patients died at the Hiawatha Asylum for Insane
Indians during its operation from 1902-1934 as the nation's only
mental hospital for Indians.
   Iron Shield said organizers are trying to locate relatives of
those who died at the asylum to see if they would want the remains
returned to their home communities or to a national Indian cemetery.
   The patients came to this city about 20 miles south of Sioux
Falls from all over the nation and from 50 tribes, including
Cherokee, Comanche, Osage, Pawnee, Winnebago, Shoshone, Chippewa
and Sioux.
   The Smithsonian Institution's recent decision to return Indian
remains in its custody to tribes has spurred interest around the
nation in reburials.
   ``A lot of tribes are beginning to develop reburial
committees,'' Iron Shield said. ``There's a lot of interest in this
issue.''
   He said he hoped that interest will help draw attention to the
asylum patients, whom he considers forgotten victims of racism and
oppression.
   ``Many of the Indian people that were sent there would be termed
as resisters of government policies,'' he said. ``Not wanting to
live on the reservations, not wanting to see the kind of treatment
that Indian people were receiving on reservations.''
   Larry Zimmerman, a professor of anthropology at the University
of South Dakota in Vermillion, agreed that the legacy of the asylum
was one of shame.
   ``This particular case is a very poignant one,'' he said. ``The
asylum was a convenient place to put political prisoners.''
   Lloyd Collier, superintendent of the city-operated Hiawatha Golf
Course, said he wants to work with the Indian group to encourage
remembrance and respect for the cemetery.
   ``There's 120 Indians buried here, and we shouldn't just forget
them,'' he said.
   Collier said the cemetery had fallen into disrepair when he took
over the job several years ago.
   ``The graves were caving in,'' he said. ``I thought I was going
to break axle on the tractor when I filled them in and smoothed
them over. It had been neglected for too long.''
   Collier has planted Russian olive and ponderosa pine trees along
the fairway to help keep balls out of the plot. He also spreads the
word that the cemetery is off-limits for play.
   ``It's just a rule here. If you hit the ball in the cemetery,
you have to pick it up and move it out.''
   Relatives and others are welcome to visit the cemetery to pay
respects, Collier said.
   ``I'd hate to have somebody tell me I couldn't see my mother's
grave,'' he said. ``If they want to come in here and visit their
ancestors, they should have that right.''
   But Zimmerman said relatives of the dead may believe removing
the remains is the only way to achieve respect. He said the golf
course on the former asylum grounds, where the doors to the
clubhouse restrooms still are marked ``Squaws'' and ``Braves,'' may
stir painful memories.
   ``Reburial may be the only realistic solution,'' he said.

<HEAD>GOP Senators Say Legislation Would Increase Airline Competition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deregulation in the airline industry has led
to domination of domestic air travel by a few companies, two
Republican senators said Friday in introducing legislation they say
would increase competition.
   Sens. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., and John McCain, R-Ariz., said
that deregulation has failed to benefit the traveling public,
despite an early flurry of competition, but that their bill is not
a return to regulation.
   The bill would instead ``address what we consider the most
egregious airline practices inhibiting competition,'' McCain said.
   ``The traveling public is not going to be dangling from the
strings of a few huge airlines,'' Danforth said.
   Under their proposed legislation:
   _Airlines would be barred from owning computerized reservation
systems, used by 85 percent of travel agents. The sponsors say that
the owners require agents to book a minimum number of the owners'
flights, the system updates the owners' fare and seat availability
more quickly and other airlines without the systems must pay
booking fees to use the system.
   _Slots, the landing rights at airports currently controlled by
the major airlines, would be auctioned off, giving preference to
new entrants in the industry.
   _The Department of Transportation would have a stronger say in
assuring competition by monitoring activity in the industry using
standards developed by the Justice Department for use in antitrust
enforcement.
   _The Transportation Department would allow airports to levy
per-passenger user fees earmarked for expanding airport capacity,
improving security or reducing the impact of airport noise.
   _The Federal Trade Commission would be given authority to police
the industry for unfair practices. Some of the practices would be
predatory pricing; overcharging for sub-leases of terminal space,
gates and baggage carousels; and use of majority-in-interest
clauses in airport leases to restrict expansion.
   _Airlines would be forbidden to share booking codes _ the
initials for airlines. For instance, a flight from Columbia, Mo.,
to London might have a TWA code even though ``feeder'' lines aren't
TWA owned. Each airline would have a unique code, Danforth said,
which would facilitate competition for bookings among regional
carriers.
   McCain said the market share of the nation's top nine airlines
grew from 78 percent in 1985 to 94 percent in 1986. On the other
hand, only 150 regional airlines were in operation in 1986,
compared with 250 in 1981, he said.

<HEAD>Chinese Nationwide Ordered to Study Party Chief's Speech</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when many Chinese thought political study
classes were winding down, a new command has come down from the
Communist Party's top levels: ``Study Well Comrade Jiang Zemin's
Important Speech.''
   Jiang is the new party general secretary, and he delivered the
speech last week as the nation prepared to mark the 40th
anniversary of Communist rule.
   It was an 80-minute, hard-line lecture on the evils of Western
liberalism and the correctness of the June military attack in
Beijing on students and citizens protesting for greater freedom.
   ``Only socialism can save China,'' Jiang said. ``Replacement of
capitalism with socialism is the great historical trend.''
   Over the past week, the party and China's official media have
praised the speech to a degree unprecedented for the words of
anyone lower than senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   ``It is a programmatic document guiding the Communist Party of
China in all its tasks in the near future,'' the party's Propaganda
Department said in the order.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said the speech
``crystalized the collective wisdom'' of people inside and outside
the party and should be used to ``conscientiously raise the
theoretical level and political acuteness of all party comrades.''
   Many see the intense campaign as an effort to convey on Ziang an
aura of leadership that he lacks.
   A party source said Jiang is not at ease in his post. The
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Jiang has been
treading carefully since taking office in June in the aftermath of
the protests, trying to make peace with both the hard-line and
reformist camps of the fractured party and trusting few people.
   He appears to have Deng's full support, but a government
employee, also speaking on condition of anonymity, predicted that
will count for little after the death of the senior leader, who is
85 and reportedly suffering from cancer.
   ``Jiang is only an interim leader,'' the government worker said,
echoing a widespread opinion. ``He is like Hua Guofeng.''
   Hua took over as party and government leader after the death of
Mao Tse-tung in 1976 but lacked his own power base in Beijing and
had lost all his top posts by 1981.
   Jiang, too, has no Beijing power base, having spent most of his
career in Shanghai, where he was party leader before June.
   Until this week's calls to study his latest speech, the level of
official media coverage of Jiang was normal for a party leader.
   The new campaign goes beyond anything ordered under Jiang's
predecessor, the now-disgraced Zhao Ziyang, at least in part
reflecting the leadership's new concern with strengthening
ideological education.
   Government ministries, research institutes, provincial and city
governments, military units and factories all have issued their own
orders to employees to ``earnestly study'' the speech and build
socialism under its inspiration.
   Half of national television's 30-minute nightly news program has
been taken up showing groups hard at study, following a
time-honored ritual that starts with the group leader summarizing
the correct line.
   Each participant then makes his own statement, mostly using
phrases from Jiang's speech and newspaper editorials about it.
   Chinese who spent most of the summer studying a speech by Deng
condemning the pro-democracy protests are not heartened by the new
campaign.
   ``We are so tired of saying all this stuff,'' one intellectual
said with a groan.

   Israel's divided inner Cabinet today rejected
an Egyptian peace plan calling for talks with a Palestinian
delegation in Cairo.
   After two days of debate, the 12 leaders of the coalition
government of the rightist Likud bloc and the center-left Labor
Party voted along party lines and deadlocked 6 to 6 on the issue.
   The tie vote automatically defeated a proposal by Vice Premier
Shimon Peres, head of Labor, to accept the Egyptian invitation.
   ``Israel today suffered a severe setback,'' said Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor.
   All Labor ministers in the policy-making inner Cabinet voted to
support the Egyptian plan and all Likud ministers voted to reject
it. Peres and other Labor ministers met immediately to discuss
their next step.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev, also of Labor, called for the
party to leave the government. But Rabin said he first wanted to
see the reaction of the Egyptians and the international community.
   ``We have a new political situation. We'll convene our party
institutions and decide about how we proceed,'' Peres said.
   In Cairo, a senior PLO official said Israel's rejection of the
plan puts the Middle East peace process on hold and that only the
United States can solve that problem.
   ``Despite all efforts by Egypt and President Mubarak ... the
intransigence of (Prime Minister Yitzhak) Shamir and his Likud bloc
takes us back again to stagnation,'' said Nabil Shaath, a key
political adviser to PLO chief Yasser Arafat.
   ``The situation calls for movement by the United States, because
it holds the key to Israel,'' he said.
   Shaath, a wealthy Cairo-based businessman, chairs the political
committee of the Palestine National Council, the PLO
parliament-in-exile. He is considered a moderate, and his name has
been mentioned as a possible participant in peace talks.
   Many leaders of Shamir's Likud viewed the Egyptian invitation,
involving meetings with Palestinians from outside the occupied
territories, as a trick to get Israel to talk indirectly to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Avi Pazner, a senior aide to Shamir, said Labor had been
``hasty'' in forcing a vote in the inner Cabinet and that there was
no reason for the year-old government to fall apart.
   ``It's not the end of the peace initiative and not the end of
the government,'' said Pazner.
   He added it was still possible that U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III would propose a specific plan to decide on the
makeup of a Palestinian delegation to talks in Cairo. A compromise
involving U.S. help on the issue was discussed before the vote.
   ``It is very possible we will get concrete American proposals
and then we will consider them,'' he said.
   Peres had questioned whether there was a firm U.S. offer to hold
three-way talks on the issue. He pushed instead for Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's proposal to hold talks in Cairo with a
10-member Palestinian delegation that would include several
Palestinians from outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   David Levy, a leading member of Likud, said: ``The Labor
proposal ... was contradictory to the initiative accepted by the
government.''
   The Israeli government proposed on May 14 that elections be held
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to select representatives
to negotiate on autonomy for the 1.7 million Palestinians of the
territories.
   Levy said meeting with a Palestinian delegation as proposed by
Egypt was unacceptable to Likud because it was a backdoor attempt
to hold talks with the PLO.
   ``The prime minister formulated it well when he said that if we
adopt (Labor's proposal), we recognize the PLO...Israel would have
walked into a trap,'' said Levy.
   He said the government would continue with its election proposal.
   Speaking on Israel radio before today's meeting, Peres accused
Shamir and Likud of stalling and trying to evade peace negotiations.
   ``Every time we reach something practical, there is a new
attempt to get out of it, a new story,'' said Peres. He rejected
Likud's position of excluding outside Palestinians from
participating in the elections.
   ``Likud has no proposal. It has one interesting offer, to create
a new Palestinian people because it's not satisfied with those in
existence. We are talking about negotiations with Palestinians as
they are in the field.''
   Ariel Sharon, the trade minister and a leading Likud hard-liner,
urged rejection of the proposed talks in Cairo before today's vote.
   ``What worries me is that we are pushing ourselves into a trap
in which we would stand alone against the Arab world that supports
the PLO and against the United States, which is our greatest
friend,'' Sharon said on Israel's armed forces radio.
   Likud argued the presence of outside Palestinians would
implicitly recognize the PLO and its demand to allow millions of
exiled refugees to return to what is now Israel.
   Some Likud hawks such as Yitzhak Modai proposed breaking up the
year-old coalition government if agreement could not be reached on
the peace proposals. But Peres and Shamir have indicated this would
not happen.
   Israelis have killed more than 580 Palestinians during the
22-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Palestinians have killed more than 120 suspected Arab
collaborators, and 40 Israelis have died in the uprising.

   At least two Burmese students hijacked
a Burmese airliner with 85 people aboard today and threatened to
blow it up unless their country's military government frees all
political prisoners and restores democracy.
   Burmese ambassador Nyunt Swe went to the hijacking site and
rejected the hijackers' demands, said a Thai navy spokesman, Lt.
Somchai Kaewvibunphan.
   The students forced the Fokker 28 aircraft to land at a Thai
military airfield and held the passengers hostage, said Col.
Somchai Dhanarajata of Thailand's Supreme Command Joint Operations
Center.
   One hijacker appeared in the door of the plane with a hand
grenade in his upraised fist. Hijackers later released 35 hostages,
Kaewvibunphan said.
   In a list given to Thai authorities, the hijackers demanded the
release of top Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, an end
to the curfew imposed by the military government and restoration of
democracy in Burma.
   They said they would detonate a bomb they had on board unless
their demands were met by 11 p.m. (noon EDT), Kaewvibunphan said.
The deadline passed, however, as Thai army negotiators talked with
the hijackers.
   Earlier, Somchai said the hijackers had insisted on a response
to their demands by midnight.
   Thai marines surrounded the aircraft of Burma's national
airline, Myanmar Airways, and a U.S.-trained, anti-hijacking unit
from the Thai air force was en route to the airfield, he said.
   The plane was returning from Mergui to Burma's capital, Rangoon,
when the hijackers ordered the pilot at gunpoint to divert to
Thailand, Burma's neighbor, according to Burma's official news
agency. The report said three hijackers were involved rather than
two as reported by Somchai.
   The plane landed at 5:40 p.m. in Utaphao, 80 miles southeast of
Bangkok, and the hijackers presented a list of demands to military
officials at the airfield, Somchai said.
   The plane carried 81 passengers and a crew of four. The
passengers were believed to be Burmese nationals since Mergui is
off-limits to foreigners.
   It was the first known hijack of a Burmese aircraft in recent
decades.
   Thailand has attempted to establish good relations with the
military government in Rangoon and has made several deals to
exploit Burma's abundant timber and fishery resources. Burmese
student activists have criticized these links and want the
international community to isolate the military government.
   Thousands of Burmese students joined ethnic rebel groups along
the Thai-Burmese border after Burmese troops crushed a student-led
uprising in Burma in September 1988, killing thousands of people
demonstrating against years of authoritarian repression.
   The crackdown on dissent continued this year, and a Rangoon
military tribunal recently sentenced three students to death for
allegedly planting a bomb at an oil refinery near Rangoon which
killed two people in July.
   The government blamed this and another explosion in July at
Rangoon's City Hall on students groups in contact with the
insurgents.
   Diplomats and dissidents say several thousand pro-democracy
supporters have been arrested since July, when the two leading
opposition politicians, Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, were placed under house
arrest.
   Suu Kyi, whose release was demanded by the hijackers, was
arrested July 20 after making strident speeches denouncing the
military government. Her National League for Democracy has emerged
as the largest opposition party in Burma.

   Jim Bakker maintained his innocence and
said he was ``sad but encouraged in God'' after a jury found the
PTL founder guilty of using his television ministry to bilk
followers of $3.7 million.
   ``I went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying I was
innocent of the charges against me,'' a smiling Bakker said after
posting bond Thursday. ``I come out still innocent of the charges
against me. I put my faith in God.''
   Today, Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, left for their home in
Orlando, Fla., and their lawyer said they would suspend their
ministry for the time being to concentrate on their appeal. But a
volunteer answering the telephone there, who declined to give her
name, said she knew of no such plans.
   The jury foreman said money corrupted Bakker, who prosecutors
said took $3.7 million in ministry funds and spent it on vacation
homes, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes cars and unusual luxuries like an
air-conditioned doghouse.
   ``He was called by God. But eventually the money became too much
for him,'' said Ricky Hill, who said during jury selection that he
was a Christian. ``We kept looking for something from the defense
and we never saw it.''
   Bakker faces up to 120 years in prison and $5 million in fines
for his conviction on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He was
charged with raising $158 million by overselling lodging
guarantees, called ``lifetime partnerships,'' at his Heritage USA
retreat.
   ``The message is you can't lie to the people and use television
and the mails to get them to send you money,'' said prosecutor
Deborah Smith, a Justice Department fraud specialist. ``It doesn't
matter who you are or how well known you are, you simply can't do
it.''
   In an interview today on ``CBS This Morning,'' Smith added, ``I
don't think any conviction is a cause for celebration at all. I
think it's very sad for his family, very sad for him.'' But she
said it was saddest for ``the 158,000 people across the country who
were defrauded, many of them of their life savings.''
   Bakker's attorney said he would appeal the verdict.
   ``We've lost a battle, but we'll win the war,'' lawyer George T.
Davis said. ``There was so much negative pretrial publicity that he
was unable to get a fair trial in this community.''
   Davis said he would return to Charlotte for the Oct. 24
sentencing with ``a surprise for Judge (Robert) Potter. ... I think
it will be a real suprise. But I can't say now. ... The big day is
really when the sentencing comes.''
   He said the Bakkers are ``going to fold up their ministry for
the present and concentrate on the appeal,'' but he declined to
elaborate. After leaving PTL, the couple began the Jim and Tammy
Ministries, which runs a church in Orlando, and conducts a
five-day-a-week evangelistic television show seen on eight cable
outlets.
   The Bakkers did not appear on the daily television show today,
and their replacements did not mention the verdict but closed by
urging viewers to ``give your prayers'' to the Bakkers.
   Bakker took off his glasses and stared straight ahead as the
verdict was read. Mrs. Bakker sat quietly behind him; her eyes
welled with tears.
   Outside the courthouse, Mrs. Bakker serenaded a crowd of
hundreds with a verse of ``On Christ, the solid rock, I stand. All
other ground is sinking sand.''
   Then she said, ``It's not over till it's over.''
   Along with supporters in the crowd were some spectators who
agreed with the verdict.
   ``I'm not the smartest man in the world, but when you get caught
with your hand in the cookie jar you've got to take what's
coming,'' Ira Bostic said.
   Later, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter released Bakker
on $250,000 bond after expressing concerns that his followers might
try to help him flee the country.
   ``My concern is that his supporters are so zealous that they
have what I call the Jim Jones mentality,'' Potter said, referring
to the cult leader who led hundreds of followers to commit suicide
in Guyana a decade ago.
   ``They think he can walk on water,'' he said of Bakker's
supporters.
   Potter, known as ``Maximum Bob'' for handing out tough prison
terms and fines, scheduled sentencing for Oct. 24.
   On his release, Bakker waded through a crowd of reporters to a
waiting white Cadillac and said: ``I feel sad but encouraged in
God.''
   Trial testimony showed PTL paid $265,000 to Jessica Hahn to
cover up a 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker that led to his
resignation from PTL in 1987.
   ``I'm sorry I don't have a song to sing like Tammy but I know
this is God's amazing grace,'' Ms. Hahn said after the conviction.
   Prosecutor Smith called Bakker ``the government's star
witness,'' saying his fraud had been preserved on videotapes of
``PTL Club'' broadcasts in which Bakker appealed for $1,000
donations in exchange for yearly stays at the retreat and theme
park near Fort Mill, S.C.
   The government said more than 152,903 partnerships were sold
between 1984 and 1987 when Bakker had only 258 rooms available, and
some partners testified they were unable to use their lodging
benefits, although others testifying for the defense said they had
no such problem.
   ``Just about every sentence he used he put God in it,'' juror
Vivian Ferguson said. ``He kept taking the people's money, and I
couldn't go along with that.''
   Bakker was his own worst enemy on the witness stand, juror
Dempsey Jones said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``His defense testimony was almost like a programmed speech,''
Jones sad. ``But when he was cross-examined by the prosecution, it
was really damaging to him _ the halting answers to questions, the
obvious not looking at jurors and things like that.''
   The trial started Aug. 28 and was interrupted Aug. 31 when
Bakker didn't come to court. His psychiatrist told the judge Bakker
was cowering in a fetal position with his head under a couch.
   Potter ordered Bakker sent to the mental hospital at the federal
prison at Butner, N.C. On Sept. 6, he was declared fit to resume
the trial.

   First lady Barbara Bush told a convocation at
Morehouse School of Medicine today that institutions like the
predominantly black Atlanta school have made her optimistic that
the nation's poor will see improved health care.
   Mrs. Bush, a former board member of the medical school, said
Morehouse's mission of providing doctors for the poor, mainly in
inner-city areas, was a major reason for her optimism.
   She said the school's student body is growing rapidly, it has a
95 percent passing rate on national board tests and it has never
experienced an operating budget deficit.
   ``I'm not naive enough to think the graduates of Morehouse will
solve all the health problems ... but I'm optimistic,'' she said.
   She urged students to keep the school's mission of serving the
poor in mind after they graduate. ``Our communities need your
skills and commitment,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bush said she wanted to dispel the widely held notion that
she was responsible for getting the medical school's founder, Dr.
Louis Sullivan, nominated as secretary of health and human services.
   She said it was her husband who first introduced her to Sullivan
and who came up with the idea of the Cabinet nomination.
   Mrs. Bush's appearance at the school today kicked off a
three-day series of events leading to Sunday's inauguration of Dr.
James A. Goodman, who will succeed Sullivan as the school's
president.
   Goodman presented the first lady with an honorary doctorate of
humane letters, citing her active support of the medical school and
her work toward erasing illiteracy.
   Mrs. Bush later visited the Basement, a non-profit recreation
center providing Atlanta teen-agers with a drug- and alcohol-free
environment.

   A grand jury investigating the crash of a USAir
jetliner into the East River last month has found no evidence of
criminal conduct, the district attorney's office said Friday.
   But the panel will continue investigating the Sept. 20 crash of
Flight 5050, which killed two people, spokesman Dick Piperno said.
The grand jury hopes to talk to the pilot and copilot, he said.
   ``So far, there's been no evidence of criminality,'' District
Attorney John Santucci said Thursday in what he described as an
interim report.
   Interviews with 25 witnesses disproved allegations that the
pilot, Capt. Michael W. Martin, behaved strangely and then
disappeared after the plane skidded into the water, he said.
   ``We found that he did not leave the airport immediately,''
Santucci said. ``He stayed at the airport lounge for a period of
time,'' and went to Jamaica Hospital for treatment after that.
   Santucci also said passengers told the investigation Martin had
acted ``properly'' before and after the accident.
   Santucci said he still wanted to consult with federal
investigators and speak to Martin and the copilot, Constantine
Kleissas, before calling off the investigation. He also said he
wanted to listen to the cockpit voice recorder.

<HEAD>USDA Ends Pesticide Tests in 10 States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says it has ended a
four-month testing program in 10 states for possible contamination
of swine and poultry by the pesticide, heptachlor.
   Lester Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service, said tests results show there is no
contamination problem and that ``will will return to routine
monitoring.''
   Crawford said Thursday that since the program began in May tests
were run on more than 2,100 hogs from 146 plants, and nearly 1,800
poultry samples from 70 plants.
   ``None showed any heptachlor residues, except for an isolated
case _ one hog in Tennessee,'' he said. ``Because of difficulties
in tracing that hog's owner, we continue to investigate that case.''
   The Environmental Protection Agency in 1978 banned heptachlor
for all agricultural uses except as a seed treatment, because the
pesticide had been shown to cause cancer in mice. Last May, the EPA
banned heptachlor as a seed treatment.
   But also in May, illegal levels of heptachlor were detected in
chickens at one poultry operation in Arkansas, Crawford said. The
firm voluntarily destroyed more than one-half million chickens and
thousands of pounds of processed products.
   As a consequence, the USDA agency set up an ``intensive
testing'' program in Arkansas and nine other states _ Illinois,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and Texas _ to determine if the problem was widespread.
   On July 10, the agency announced that no evidence of further
contamination had been found. However, the testing was continued as
a further check.

   Officials said Friday at least 27
people were killed in southern and central Sri Lanka in the
previous 24 hours, most of them by vigilantes fighting
anti-government Sinhalese radicals.
   Military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said the bodies of 21 ethnic Sinhalese youths were found
Friday in and around Kandy, 60 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Two bodies were found in Kandy's main bus terminal, 15 in Geloya
village and four in Mahiyawa village, they said.
   A day earlier, the bodies of 18 young Sinhalese were discovered
on the Peradeniya University campus in Kandy. The victims were
either beheaded or shot.
   Residents and military officials blamed vigilantes for both
massacres, which they described as revenge for the murder Wednesday
of Edward Nagahawatta, the unversity's assistant registrar and a
volunteer soldier. He was killed by two gunmen on a bicycle, who
escaped.
   A government statement said gunmen killed Ranjit Perera, a
free-lance news photographer, on Thursday after dragging him from
his home in Kegalle, 45 miles northeast of Colombo. Officials said
privately they believed Perera, 29, was killed by pro-government
vigilantes for taking pictures of their victims.
   Human rights groups claim the government actively supports
vigilante groups in its conflict with the People's Liberation
Front, a radical guerrilla group from Sri Lanka's Sinahalese ethnic
minority. The government denies it.
   Officials blame the extremists for most of the 5,000 deaths
reported since 1987, when the ultranationalist group began its
campaign of violence. The government statement said the Sinhalese
extremists killed five people in southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese
heartland, during the previous 24 hours.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa called an interparty meeting last
month in an effort to end the violence by resolving ethnic
differences in this island nation off the tip of India.
   The extremist group refused to attend and spurned a unilateral
six-day truce the government declared. Military officials say 80
people were killed during the cease-fire period, which ended
Tuesday.
   Sinhalese radicals oppose the government's peace overtures to
ethnic Tamil guerrillas, who began fighting in 1983 for an
independent nation in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, and to the
presence of an Indian peacekeeping force.
   At least 11,000 people have been killed in the Tamil war,
including 1,000 Indian soldiers.
   Indian soldiers were deployed to supervise a surrender of arms
by Tamil guerrillas, but the main Tamil force continued fighting.
India became involved because it is the regional power and has a
Tamil population of 60 million.
   Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people and accuse the Sinhalese majority,
predominantly Buddhist, of discrimination.

<TEXT>
   The tax and mail fraud conspiracy
conviction of Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. was challenged Friday in a
federal appeals court as a rush job that violated the political
maverick's due process rights.
   But the prosecutor said LaRouche's attorneys failed to show
prejudice in the handling of the case.
   LaRouche, a political extremist who has espoused bizarre
conspiracy theories that include allegations of drug-dealing and
other crimes by world leaders, was convicted in December in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria on 11 counts of mail fraud, one count
of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to
defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
   The trial of LaRouche and six associates stemmed from more than
$30 million in loans raised by LaRouche's political supporters. The
government said LaRouche had no intention of repaying the loans and
avoided taxes by reporting no income and having his personal
expenses paid through corporations he controlled.
   Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, chief attorney for
LaRouche's appeal, told a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals that trial Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. allowed only
35 days from arraignment to trial and, once the proceedings began,
failed to adequately question jurors on how much they knew about
LaRouche.
   ``It was just an incredible rush,'' Clark said. ``You just have
to ask why.''
   The appeals panel did not rule immediately. Decisions from the
court usually take from a few weeks to several months.
   Odin Phillips Anderson, another lawyer for LaRouche, said the
defense chose not to antagonize Bryan by requesting a delay but
pushed to have the trial moved to Boston, where a similar case
against LaRouche had resulted in a May 1988 mistrial. The Boston
charges were dropped after the Alexandria case was concluded.
   ``LaRouche is 67 years old,'' he said. ``He's sentenced to 15
years. Surely if this case isn't reversed, it's a death sentence.''
   U.S. Attorney Kent S. Robinson II said the ``substantial
overlap'' in the Boston and Alexandria cases and the effort to move
the trial showed that LaRouche's lawyers were well acquainted with
the issues before the court.
   ``There's just no showing that the defendant's lawyers were
unable to try this case,'' he said, adding that government
witnesses were thoroughly and extensively cross-examined.
   Robinson also said Bryan was careful to prevent irrelevant
information about LaRouche's political views from getting into
testimony. He said the judge also questioned potential jurors about
their awareness of news reports concerning LaRouche, and those who
showed bias were dismissed.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers, agreeing on a massive expansion of
child care aid through tax credits and subsidies, still must decide
between competing proposals on how to divide up the subsidies.
   ``It's a good day for America's children,'' Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., said Thursday as the House approved the child care
measure, which is expected to cost $22.7 billion over the next five
years. ``The Congress is more enlightened than a lot of people
thought,'' she said.
   The House overwhelmingly rejected a smaller $17.2 billion
administration-endorsed child care plan that would have eliminated
requirements for state regulation of child care providers. The
substitute, offered by Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, was defeated
on a 230-195 vote.
   Also rejected by a 285-140 margin was an amendment by Rep.
Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., mirroring Bush's proposal last March to
expand child care aid solely through tax credits.
   Democratic leaders refused to allow a vote on competing
proposals on how to divide up some $1.75 billion in new direct
subsidies. Instead, they sent both to a conference with the Senate,
which approved its own child care package last June.
   The child care measure was included as part of a bill to reduce
spending by nearly $11 billion in fiscal 1990, which began last
Sunday. The overall bill, with a variety of unrelated proposals
such as a cut in capital gains tax rates and a repeal of the
year-old catastrophic care program for the elderly, was approved on
a 333-91 vote.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia predicted after
the House's action Thursday that Bush would veto the entire bill if
House-Senate negotiators retain language specifying regulatory
mandates and restricting aid for church-provided child care.
   Both the Senate version and one of the House versions target
much of the aid toward establishing child care facilities in the
public schools.
   However, the House also armed its negotiators with a version
written by its Ways and Means Committee to provide the $1.75
billion in new direct subsidies over the next five years through
existing entitlement block grants to the states.
   That plan, supported by governors as well as churches, would
allow the new aid to continue flowing to church-supported child
care centers through voucher programs.
   Stenholm's measure would have dropped requirements that states
inspect child care centers and provide 15 hours of annual training.
It also would have ended current child care tax deductions of up to
$2,400 for families with incomes above $90,000.
   ``We believe the family is the best determiner of how child care
should be provided, not the federal government,'' Stenholm said in
leading the attack on the proposed standards.
   Supporters of the proposed standards, however, argued that
increasing the quality of child care is just as important as
increasing its availability and reducing the cost of it to poor
families.
   ``The federal government has found it appropriate to regulate
the type of food we eat so that our health is protected,'' said
Rep. Thomas J. Downey, D-N.Y. ``Clearly our health is important and
so are our children. They deserve the finest and the best care we
can provide for them.''
   All the surviving proposals would double the size of the
preschool Head Start program for poor children and convert it into
a year-round, 10-hours-a-day operation.
   The bulk of the new aid _ $13.5 billion over the next five years
_ is in the form of increased Earned Income Tax Credits for poor
families with children under age 12.
   Basically the credits would expanded by a maximum of $200 to
$300 for each child in qualifying families plus another $430 per
family if one or more of the children is under age 6.

   An Israeli officer, wanted by Colombia in
connection with alleged training of drug-cartel hit squads, is
offering Americans a two-week anti-terrorism course that includes
instruction in hostage rescue and sniper techniques.
   But the Chicago-based company which is recruiting for the course
said Friday that the first session, scheduled to start in Israel on
Nov. 25, would probably be canceled because applicants so far lack
the required experience.
   Ads which appeared in recent months in journals devoted to
military and police issues described the Israeli course as
consisting of ``all phases of hands-on anti-terrorism training,
ending with a helicopter assault to rescue hostages from built-up
areas or from aircraft.''
   The training is being conducted by Hod Hahanit, an Israeli
security firm run by reserve Col. Yair Klein. Colombia last month
issued an arrest warrant for Klein and for another Israeli,
accusing them of training drug cartel hit squads.
   Klein told police investigating the case in Israel that he
trained Colombian farmers to protect themselves against leftist
guerrillas and was unaware of any connection to the country's drug
lords.
   Michael Epstein, who runs a security company called
International Association of Airborne Veterans Ltd., said his firm
had received the franchise from Hod Hahanit, Hebrew for Spearhead,
to ``run foreigners through the Israeli anti-terrorism training.''
   The course costs $3,685, including round trip air fare from New
York to Tel Aviv, lodging, meals and insurance, according to the
printed information issued by Epstein's firm. Epstein said 15
applicants had sent him deposits and their money would be refunded
because most of them were not qualified.
   He said the decision to scrap the first session was not
connected in any way to the Israeli police investigation of Klein
and several other officers involved in security work abroad.
   The application form asks applicants about their military or
police service, their rank and awards they have received.
   ``Your physical condition must be superior,'' according to the
ads.
   ``The course is the most comprehensive and professional in the
world today. The Israelis are the number one in the world today for
terrorist prevention, protection ... and hostage rescue,''
according to the ads.
   Klein is at the top of a list of seven Israeli instructors, all
of them reserve officers with ranks ranging from major to major
general.
   The list of courses includes lectures on anti-terrorism combat,
submachine gun use, sniper training in daylight or at night, and
familiarization with Soviet-made weapons such as AK-47 rifles and
rocket-propelled grenades.
   There is also a course in driving techniques, including shooting
from and at a vehicle, employment of helicopters, combat in
built-up areas and rappelling.
   Other classes include hostage negotiations, endurance training
and ``classified training not to be published.'' The ads do not
elaborate on the last item.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged East
Germans today to be patient for change as he helped observe 40
years of a Communist system that thousands of East Germans have
rejected by fleeing West.
   The Kremlin chief said he had ``complete confidence'' in East
Germany's ability to solve its growing problems.
   Communist authorities closed three major border crossings
between East and West Berlin, and church sources said riot police
with clubs, tear gas and water cannons patrolled the streets of
major cities throughout East Germany.
   The sources also reported new clashes between police and
protesters, and West German television showed battles in Dresden
between police and protesters hoping to join the exodus of refugees.
   ``Be patient, don't panic and don't be sad. We are very close
partners and we will solve our problems and struggles together,''
Gorbachev told 1,000 East Germans at a monument for the victims of
facsism.
   ``Gorby! Gorby!'' East Germans shouted as Gorbachev arrived from
Moscow.
   Asked if he thought the situation in East Germany was dangerous,
he said: ``I don't think so.''
   ``Compared to our problems, there is no comparison,'' he said
with a chuckle. ``Nothing surprises us anymore.''
   ``We have complete confidence in'' East Germany's ability to
solve its problems, he said.
   Gorbachev joined other East bloc leaders for a two-day show of
unity, despite fractured relations over the refugee flight and East
Germany's reluctance to try the type of political reforms he has
championed.
   East German leader Erich Honecker welcomed Gorbachev at East
Berlin's Schoenefeld airport, the state news agency ADN said.
Gorbachev later planned to address Communist Party dignitaries.
   Also today, a train brought 633 East German refugees from Poland
to West Germany, the latest of more than 47,000 citizens who have
fled this tightly controlled society to the West since
mid-September.
   There were efforts to avoid further embarrassment to the East
Berlin government. Authorities closed three of the nine busiest
border crossings into the city, turning back hundreds of tourists
and West Germans since Thursday, said Werner Thronicker, a
spokesman for the West Berlin government.
   East Berlin, the site of anniversary events, was bedecked with
the fixtures of socialist celebration. Huge red banners were draped
from the Communist Party headquarters, reviewing stands were set
for parades and flags hung from public buildings and apartment
blocks.
   Kiosks were plastered with posters showing construction workers
and young mothers appreciating accomplishments of the postwar
republic, founded on Oct. 7, 1949.
   But the image of the East Germans who fled to the West through
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland was broadcast nationwide by West
German television.
   The West German government said it saw ``no reason for
celebration'' since the date marks four decades of the division of
the German nation. It also criticized the latest developments in
East Germany.
   ``The blocking of borders, the sending back of tourists, the
violent supression of peaceful demonstrations and the officially
declared rejection of political and economic reforms takes away all
hope from the people,'' chief government spokesman Hans Klein said
in Bonn.
   And on Thursday, as the ailing 77-year-old Honecker prepared for
festivities meant to show the virtues of strict doctrine, thousands
of would-be emigrees clashed with police in Dresden. West Germany's
ZDF television network said young demonstrators threw stones at
security forces on Thursday and dozens of windows were broken at
Dresden's train station.
   Witnesses said police used water cannon and truncheons to
disperse those who hoped to jump aboard trains carrying East German
refugees westward from Prague.
   In Magdeburg, north of Leipzig, police clashed with 600 people
who joined a silent march through the city after a church prayer
service late Thursday, said Church sources in East Berlin. About
200 people were arrested.
   Riot police equipped with clubs, tear gas, shields and water
cannons patrolled the streets of many major cities throughout the
country, said the sources, who demanded anonymity.
   Those who left said 40 years had created a country ahead of its
East bloc neighbors in consumer goods but behind in the less
tangible measures of opportunity.
   They described a nation where Communist Party loyalty determined
education and employment, censorship concealed truth, and police
supervision was a part of daily life. Many hid from television
cameras, fearing relatives left behind would be harassed.
   ``I cannot say I was ever wanting for food or things, that's why
it was so hard,'' said a young East Berlin woman who reached the
West German Embassy in Warsaw with her 2-year-old daughter. ``But
there was nothing else, just limits.''
   Gorbachev's attendance at the celebration is viewed as a formal
show of support for East Germany, which has rebuffed the economic
and political reforms sweeping much of Eastern Europe.
   Although he did nothing to censure the Warsaw Pact allies who
served as springboards to freedom for the refugees, it was not
likely he would criticize Honecker, who some say is likely to be
replaced soon as Communist Party chief.
   But there were reports Gorbachev might privately pressure East
Germany's aging leader to ease his resistance to reforms.
   Unrest within East Germany, along the East Bloc's frontier with
the West, is unacceptable to the Soviets.
   It is equally unacceptable for disagreements between East
Germany and Hungary _ which allowed thousands pass to the West _ to
develop into an open split that might weaken the alliance.
   Gorbachev has stated that the Eastern European allies may follow
their own path to socialism. The Soviets have watched quietly as
Hungary reforms its economy and Poland experiments with the bloc's
first non-communist government.
   A West German newspaper, Bild, said today that Gorbachev would
try to persuade East Berlin to ease press censorship, permit
greater freedom of expression and loosen travel restrictions.
   Other Western reports said Gorbachev and his foreign minister,
Eduard Shevardnadze, quietly helped arrange the exodus of East
German refugees from Prague over the weekend.

<HEAD>Damaged Coastal Areas Face High Tides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal areas damaged by Hurricane Hugo may be
facing a new threat from slightly higher than normal tides next
weekend.
   The combination of a full moon and the moon's nearness to Earth
will conspire to raise the tide a couple of feet above average, the
National Ocean Service reported.
   Aiding in this is the fact that the moon will be at its closest
point of the year.
   But weather is a much bigger factor than the moon's alignment,
pointed out Milt Rutstein of the Ocean Service, a division of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``As long as there's no storm, it's just another high tide,''
said Rutstein.
   Average high tide at Charleston, S.C., is 5.3 feet, explained
Rutstein, while the prediction calls for high tides of between 7.0
feet and 7.3 feet on Oct. 14-16.
   However, strong northwest winds could drive the tides back out
to sea, while a strong southeast wind could pile up even more water
and increase the threat, he pointed out. The most important
consideration will be the weather on those days.
   Similar tidal circumstances are expected to occur in November
and again in April.
   Causing the high tide will be the fact that the moon is at
perigee at the same time it is full, Rutstein explained.
   The orbit of the moon is not perfectly round, but rather oval
shaped. Perigee is the time of the month when the moon is closest
to Earth, and that closeness allows it to exert greater pull on the
oceans.
   Perigee will occur shortly after midnight Oct. 15, Rutstein said.
   LeRoy Doggett of the U.S. Naval Observatory reported that at
that time the moon will just over 221,000 miles from Earth. That's
the closest the moon has come so far this year, although Doggett
said slightly closer passes are possible.
   ``It's enough, I think, to make a difference,'' compared to the
month before and after. The perigee in September, for example,
found the moon 1,500 miles farther away.
   And in November, when high tides are again expected with the
full moon and perigee occurring one day apart, the moon's perigee
will be about 300 miles farther away than this month.
   Besides the perigee, the fact that the full moon occurs late on
the 14th also encourages the high tide, said Rutstein.
   The highest tides, called spring tides, occur every 14 days,
when the moon is new and full. New moon occurs when the moon is on
the same side of Earth as the sun and the two pull together on the
oceans. Full moon means the moon is on the opposite side of earth
from the sun and the two pull against one another.
   Lower tides, called neap tides, occur when the sun and moon are
at right angles to one another.

   The Senate today defeated a plan that would
have killed catastrophic health coverage for physicians' fees and
repealed the unpopular surtax on retirees that finances most
benefits under the program.
   The amendment, by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., would have
retained insurance coverage for catastrophic hospital and
prescription expenses. It was defeated on a 64-35 vote.
   Other plans for significantly changing the catastrophic program
would drop coverage for prescriptions. Kennedy said 5.4 million
people had to bear catastrophic health costs because of
prescriptions last year, compared to 1.3 million because of
hospital bills and 2.3 million due to physicians' fees.
   ``Nobody has any information on how much this (drug) program
will cost,'' protested Sen. William Roth, R-Del. He noted estimates
that administration of drug benefits will cost $2 billion a year.
   Kennedy and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsor of a plan that
would retain coverage for physicians' fees and hospital costs but
not drugs, agreed on one point: the surtax on retirees should be
eliminated.
   ``The surtax is the object of the anger and ire of senior
Americans,'' McCain said.
   In addition to repealing the surtax, which is paid by about 40
percent of retirees, McCain's amendment would wipe out coverage for
prescription drugs and expanded coverage for physicians's fees
while retaining full coverage of hospital bills.
   Senate leaders are rallying behind a plan by Sen. David
Durenberger, R-Minn., that would keep more benefits of the program,
wipe out drug coverage and significantly reduce _ but not repeal _
the surtax, which is paid by higher-income retirees.
   But there is considerable support for outright repeal.
   Durenberger's proposal was embraced Thursday by Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who said ``the rush for repeal
... is shocking.'' But a short time later, Richard G. Darman,
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said
the administration has not endorsed any specific plan to salvage
the program.
   The Senate was expected to decide the program's fate today. The
House already has voted by a lopsided margin to repeal it.
   Sullivan, in a speech to the National Press Club and in a letter
to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said repeal would represent a major setback to national
health policy.
   ``To take back from tens of millions of elderly Americans the
comfort of knowing that serious illness will not cause them
financial ruin would not only be unwise health policy, but would
simply be an unforgivable act of political expedience,'' Sullivan
told the press club.
   Congress is considering repealing or scaling back the program
because of loud complaints from its intended beneficiaries: the 33
million retirees who are eligible for Medicare.
   The program is being attacked by some retirees who already have
other catastrophic coverage, and from some with higher incomes, who
must pay an income surtax of up to $800 a year to finance coverage
for themselves and low-income older Americans.
   Durenberger said his proposal ``would provide seniors with the
equivalent of $4,000 worth of private medigap insurance coverage at
a cost of between $48 and $300 per year.''
   His amendment had the support of Bentsen, Senate Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, and Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas.
   The catastrophic law expanded Medicare benefits to protect
retirees against being wiped out financially by a long illness.
   This protection includes full coverage of hospital bills, after
the beneficiary pays the first $560; full coverage of doctors'
bills after the first $1,370 a year, starting in 1990; half of
prescription drugs after a $600 deductible starting in 1991; 150
days a year of nursing home care plus other benefits for
mammography, home care, hospice care and special payments for the
poor.
   The program is financed chiefly by a surtax of up to $800 a year
on the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees who pay at least $150
federal income tax. The remaining cost is covered by a flat monthly
premium of $4 paid by all but the poorest retirees.
   Durenberger's proposal would retain full hospital coverage;
delay starting full coverage of doctors' bills until 1991 and then
require the patient to pay the first $1,780 a year; eliminate
coverage for most drugs; require a beneficiary to spend three days
in a hospital before qualifying for skilled nursing care, and
retain most of the lesser benefits, including mammographies,
respite care and home health care.
   The $800-a-year maximum surtax would be held to $200 this year
and next, then raised to $250 for the following three years. The
current surtax rate of 15 percent of income tax liability would be
cut to 10 percent for five years.
   The additional catastrophic drug premium of 90 cents a month,
rising to $3.02 by 1993, would be eliminated.

   The nation's top military leaders told
senators today they would not have changed their advice to
President Bush based on what they now know about the circumstances
of Tuesday's failed coup in Panama, a lawmaker said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified for three hours in closed
session with the Senate Intelligence and Armed Services committees.
   The two panels planned to issue later today a factual analysis
of issues that remain in dispute surrounding the events in Panama
and contacts between the rebel officers who organized the coup and
U.S. officials.
   ``There are a lot of things in dispute'' said Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., referring to media and other
accounts which he said are ``all over the lot.'' He declined
further comment.
   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Cheney and Powell ``basically
... would not have changed their decision and recommendations to
the president, based on what they know today.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman
and a leading critic of administration handling of the crisis, said
he had not changed his mind following the briefing. He again
criticized what he called ``a flawed policy'' in Panama.
   ``We're going to get to the bottom of this,'' Boren said in
advance of the hearing. ``I am convinced the full facts have not
been laid out to us or the American people.''
   Among the mysteries surrounding the coup, Boren said in an
interview, is exactly what was said in a conversation Tuesday
afternoon between two mid-level rebel officers and an American
officer, Army Gen. Marc Cisneros, at a U.S. military base in Panama.
   It is clear, the senator said, that the rebels asked the United
States to provide logistical support by blocking roads and bridges
that might be used by troops loyal to Noriega to approach the
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters where the dictator was then
being held by the dissidents.
   But whether they also offered to turn over Noriega to the United
States remains unclear, he said, adding it appears that differing
versions of the conversation were given to the National Security
Council, the CIA and the State Department.
   One version reports that the rebels said they were unable to
deliver Noriega to the U.S. base, but would cooperate if a U.S.
helicopter were sent to remove him. The other version portrayed the
rebels as refusing to turn the dictator over to the United States,
saying they wanted him to retire and remain in Panama.
   ``I want to see those cables and compare them,'' Boren said. ``I
think they've got a lot of explaining to do.'' He said he may
schedule hearings and ``put some people under oath.''
   Despite Cheney's efforts to explain administration actions and
detail the uncertainty that pervaded Tuesday's situation, members
of Congress in both parties continued to criticize.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the administration's story
a ``weak-kneed explanation for failure'' and said the United States
had ``botched'' the handling of the coup. ``It's an incredible
stain on us,'' he said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he doubted
administration assertions that Noriega was left weakened by the
coup attempt. ``It seems to me that he is emerging from this,
perhaps, unfortunately strengthened,'' Foley said.
   Cheney, in a round of media interviews and in meetings with
members of Congress, defended the administration's caution as the
only responsible course in the face of incomplete intelligence and
suspicions about the identities and motives of the rebels.
   He said the coup leaders had made only general requests for
support and called ``hogwash'' any suggestion that there was a
direct appeal for the United States to snatch Noriega away.
   But in a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
contended the requests for help had been more extensive and more
specific.
   ``They told the U.S. officers that they were holding Noriega
captive, and requested U.S. assistance to take custody of Noriega
and remove him to the United States,'' Helms alleged.
   Boren said Helms' information, which came from staff inquiries,
had ``some basis to it.''
   Helms made his comments during debate on an admittedly symbolic
amendment to a drug bill that underscored Bush's authority to use
military force to apprehend Noriega and bring him to justice on
drug charges.
   The amendment was later killed, 74-25, after Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., termed it ``the officially sanctioned snatching
provision.''
   The Senate then adopted, 99-1, an alternative proposed by Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., expressing support for Bush's efforts to
democratize Panama through a ``full range of economic, diplomatic
and military options.'' Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., was the lone
dissenter.

   Pope John Paul II told Ukrainian Catholic
bishops he hopes to travel to the Soviet Union to attend a
religious gathering in 1992, Ukrainian church officials said Friday.
   The pope expressed the desire to go to the Ukraine in a private
audience Thursday with a group of Ukrainian Catholic bishops living
in the West, according to two American bishops at the meeting.
   In his public remarks to the bishops Thursday, the pope urged
Soviet authorities to grant immediate legal status to the Ukrainian
Church, which has been suppressed 43 years.
   The pope is expected to raise the Ukrainian issue during Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Italy on Nov. 29-Dec. 1. It
would be the first meeting between supreme leaders of the Roman
Catholic Church and the Kremlin.
   Bishop Basil H. Losten of Stamford, Conn., and Bishop Robert M.
Moskal of Parma, Ohio, told a news conference the Ukrainian
Catholic Church hopes to hold a eucharistic congress in Lvov,
Ukraine, in 1992.
   A eucharistic congress is a gathering of the faithful to foster
devotion to the sacrament of the altar.
   The meeting is currently scheduled to be held in Winnipeg,
Canada, but the bishops said it would be moved to Lvov if the
church is legalized and if Soviet authorities grant visas to
Ukrainian Catholics living abroad.
   ``The Holy Father expressed his desire to be present at the
eucharistic congress should it be held in Ukraine,'' Losten said,
adding it would be up to the head of the Ukrainian church,
Vatican-based Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky, to invite him.
   The pope has often expressed his desire to travel to the Soviet
Union, but only on condition he could visit his flock throughout
the country, including Ukraine and Lithuania.
   Some church officials have expressed hope that a meeting with
Gorbachev could pave the way for the first papal visit to the
Soviet Union.
   The Ukrainian church was forcibly merged with the Russian
Orthodox Church in 1946, with bishops and priests arrested,
deported and killed. But the church has flourished underground and
the bishops estimated there are as many as 5 million Catholics in
the Ukraine today.
   Moskal said the bishops, who have been holding a special,
two-week synod in Rome, hope the pope's meeting with Gorbachev will
lead to the church's legalization.
   But he added, ``Here and there you hear of (Soviet authorities)
not bothering the people in one village or town. And then in
another place the people are continually harassed and persecuted.
So we still feel pessimistic about a lot of things.''

<HEAD>Bush Enters Hospital For Minor Surgery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush entered the hospital Friday for
minor surgery to remove a troublesome cyst from his finger.
   Bush, arriving at Walter Reed Army Medical Center a few miles
from the White House, smiled and waved at reporters as he stepped
out of his helicopter.
   He raised the hand that was to be operated on for photographers
as he entered the hospital for the one-hour procedure.
   Making light of the matter the day before the surgery, Bush had
laughed over it and told reporters not to ``make a federal case of
it.''
   The operation required a local anesthetic called a digital nerve
block, and aides said the president would be awake throughout.
   The procedure was considered routine and Bush planned to leave
from the hospital Friday afternoon to spend the weekend at the
presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
   The White House identified the surgeons as Col. Allen Smith,
chief of hand surgery at Walter Reed, and George Bogumill, who
holds a similar position at Gerogetown University Hospital.
   Bush has had the cyst on the middle finger of his right hand for
several years, but it recently came to the point of being
bothersome, said Whtie House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The spokesman told reporters the cyst was ``not really painful,
but it's a nuisance in the sense that it's large enough to cause
him some anxiety.''
   Doctors had drained the cyst on May 10 when Bush underwent a
routine physical examination. The doctors said it had been present
for several years and did not pose a medical problem for the
65-year-old president.
   In recent weeks, Bush, who is left-handed, has been playing
golf, tennis and horseshoes and baiting fishhooks, as well as
signing proclamations, with no apparent difficulty from the cyst.
   Fitzwater said the the cyst was considered benign, but that
there would be a ``routine pathological examination of the tissue''
to verify that afterward.
   The cyst was described as a quarter-inch in diameter, rising
about an eighth of an inch above the surface of the finger, with a
root that extended under the skin back toward the finger joint.
   The president jokingly told reporters ``Don't tempt me'' when
asked to display the finger in question for cameras and
photographers during a pphoto session Thursday with Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi. He then explained to Savimbi that the finger
is sometimes used for an obscene gesture.
   Bush promised reporters, ``I will show you my scar afterward.''
   Bush's doctors say he is in very good health and exceptionally
good condition for his age, as evidenced by his propensity for
vigorous sports and his often tightly-packed work schedule.
   He had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his face and a
small, noncancerous polyp removed from his colon in 1986, when he
was vice president.

   The cyst that grew on the middle finger of
President Bush's right hand may have started from some minor,
forgotten injury that happened during a game of tennis or
horseshoes, or while he stalked the wily trout or bluefish.
   Surgeons called the benign growth a mucous cyst, or ganglion.
These cysts usually occur, as did the president's, between the last
joint and the finger nail. They are not painful and usually don't
affect the function of the finger. But mucous cysts are susceptible
to infection that can be quite serious.
   ``Ganglions or mucous cysts are the most common form of benign
little tumors that occur in the hand,'' said Dr. Mary H. McGrath, a
hand surgeon at George Washingtion University Medical Center.
``They are associated, generally speaking, with some sort of
injury, often trivial.''
   Bush, she said, ``is very characteristic'' of the people who get
mucous cysts ``because he is active and plays sports.''
   The cysts are filled with a clear, jelly-like material that is
the same as the fluid that lubricates joints, she said. The small
growths are never malignant, but doctors usually recommend that
they be removed.
   ``One of the bad things about these (cysts) is that they arise
from the joint and, consequently, if they break and get infected
the person can get an infection in the joint at the end of the
finger,'' said McGrath. Such an infection ``is very hard to clear
up'' and can sometimes result in amputation.
   ``It's very common for people to have no idea what the cyst is
and they drain it themselves,'' she said. ``That can lead to big
problems.''
   Often, these cysts can press against the bed of the fingernail,
leading to a groove or some other deformity in the nail.
   McGrath has not examined Bush and is not personally connected
with his case, but she said the typical removal of a mucous cyst is
a safe, but ``meticulous,'' procedure that takes just over an hour.
   First, the finger is deadened with what is called a digital
nerve block. This is done by shooting an anesthetic into a nerve in
the hand, wrist or arm. Then an incision is made.
   ``You go in through the skin on the back of the finger and peel
out the cyst,'' she said. ``Then you follow the stalk back to the
joint.''
   The stalk, or root, of the cyst must be removed or the growth
could recur.
   After that, the skin is sewn back together and the finger is
bandaged. Often a splint is worn until the stitches are removed,
about a week after surgery.
   Recovery is usually complete and uneventful, she said, which
means the president may be back on the tennis court or pitching
horseshoes again within a short time.

   A fire blamed on careless smoking struck a
nursing home while patients were going to sleep, killing nine
people and injuring nearly 100 as rescuers rushed dazed patients to
safety through halls flooded with choking smoke.
   The elderly evacuees, some in bedclothes and some naked when
they were saved, were helped down halls and down ladders as
firefighters tackled the Thursday night blaze in the 172-bed
Hillhaven Rehabilitation and Convalescent Center.
   Capt. Herbert Redfield, chief of the city's fire investigation
unit, said in a statement today that careless use of smoking
materials was the cause of the fire, which broke out about 10:20
p.m. One of the victims, Major Leary, lived in the second-story
room where the fire broke out, along with another man who survived,
Redfield said.
   As the fire at the four-story brick home was being put out early
today, patients huddled on the lawns of nearby houses, attended by
paramedics and neighbors.
   The fire was mostly contained to the room where it began, but
smoke spread throughout, and many of the injured suffered from
smoke inhalation, said Norfolk Fire Chief Thomas E. Gardner.
   ``Even though we lost nine people, the potential was there to
lose significantly more than that,'' Gardner said.
   ``I woke up in a roomful of smoke,'' said patient Robert Bell,
82. ``The whole room was saturated with smoke. You couldn't see and
you couldn't hardly breathe.''
   Gardner said the nursing home did not have any sprinklers, but
said they were not required when the home was built in 1969. He
said he hoped the fire would inspire lawmakers to require
sprinklers.
   ``I personally advocate that you don't build anything in the
city that you don't put sprinklers in,'' Gardner said today. ``I'm
hoping this will cause the legislators to help make a modification
to the building code that would require a sprinkler system in at
least buildings of this occupancy class.''
   He also said the rescue efforts were hampered by the fact that
many patients ``were hooked up to all sorts of medical equipment.''
   The nine residents _ eight women and one man ranging in age from
65 to 97 _ died of smoke inhalation, said Deborah Myers, a
spokeswoman for Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.
   The 98 people taken to eight hospitals suffered smoke inhalation
and minor burns, officials said. Twenty of people were admitted to
Sentara Norfolk General, including six in critical condition, Ms.
Myers said. The rest were treated and taken to other nursing
facilities.
   The fire was extinguished after midnight.
   Second-floor resident Harriett Waddill, 76, described the
confusion:
   ``Everything was quiet. We were going to bed. All of a sudden we
heard this commotion in the hall. They were running up and down the
hall and they were yelling, `Get him out of the room.' It was
getting so black I couldn't even identify were my bed was.''
   Katie Gwaltney, 88, said nursing home workers told her to stay
in bed in her fourth-floor room after she heard the fire alarm.
   ``They came and told us that everything was OK,'' she said as
family members comforted her in her wheelchair. ``I couldn't get
out. I just lay so still.''
   Gardner said many residents stayed in their rooms with the doors
closed while firefighters used a giant pressurized ventilation
system called a smoke blaster to clear the smoke and pump fresh air
into the building.
   Officials said roughly 200 people, including about 160
residents, were in the building when the fire broke out.
   Gardner said the state code requires sprinkers in buildings that
are five stories or taller. The nursing home is four stories. He
said officials have ruled out foul play and would release the cause
of the fire late today.
   Nursing home officials will consider installing sprinklers, but
they are difficult to place in existing buildings, said Jeffrey M.
McKain, a regional vice president for the Hillhaven Corp., a
Tacoma, Wash.-based chain that owns the home.
   ``It's an extremely difficult system to retrofit,'' McKain said.
   Jeff Crow, who lives across the street from the nursing home,
said he was watching television when he noticed an orange glow in a
second-floor room.
   ``I knew something was wrong when they started laying sheets
out'' on the building's lawn, he said. ``Then they started bringing
bodies out. It was terrible.''
   Crow comforted one elderly man who was brought down by a fire
truck ladder.
   ``He was coherent,'' Crow said. ``He was a little awe-struck by
it, talking about how the Lord took care of people.''
   As another resident in a wheelchair waited to be rolled into a
van, an attendant leaned over her shoulder.
   ``You're all right,'' she said. ``You're going to get some sleep
soon.''
   At Sentara Norfolk General, dozens of people waited in the lobby
hours after the fire for information on their relatives in the
nursing home.
   Bob Crumpler, who drove 50 miles from his home in Ivor to check
on his 88-year-old mother, Esther Crocker, said he had heard she
was all right.
   ``We'd still like to know where she's at because I know she's
scared,'' he said.
   Myers identified the victims as Louise Leigh, 76; Dewey
McDaniel, 92; Susie Foreman, 71; Eula Oslin, 79; Mary Harrell, 74;
Mittie Tann, 79; Roberta L. Lightfoot, 97; Leary, 78; and Nemesio
Tabor, 65. All but Leary are women, she said.

<HEAD>States Facing Revenue Declines, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State governments facing current or potential
declines in revenues are being asked by Congress to spend billions
on social programs and will have to dip into their reserves, cut
other spending and raise taxes, state officials said Friday.
   In their annual fiscal survey of the states, the National
Governors' Association and the National Association of State Budget
Officers said many Northeastern states ended fiscal 1989 with
balances smaller than they enjoyed at the end of the previous year.
   Many other states closed out the year with ending balances
higher than before because they had anticipated economic slowdowns
that did not occur, the two organizations of state officials said.
   Neverthless, their report said, the states of the populous
Northeast are often a harbinger of things to come in the economy as
a whole and ``the rapid decline in revenues in these states could
portend downturns in other states.''
   Raymond G. Scheppach, executive director of the governors'
association, said that ``early indications are that a number of
states (in the Northeast) are not seeing any revenue growth at all
in the first three months'' of fiscal year 1990.
   The fiscal year ends on June 30 in 46 states, on March 31 in New
York, on Aug. 31 in Texas and on Sept. 30 in Michigan and Alabama.
   Scheppach said programs for catastrophic medical care will cost
states an estimated $4.2 billion over the next four years, despite
repeal and cutback measures currently being considered in Congress.
   He said changes in nursing home laws enacted in 1987 will cost
states an estimated $2 billion.
   If Medicaid revisions being considered become law, states will
have to find an additional $11.2 billion to pay for them over the
four-year period, he said.
   ``They (Congress) still want to do a lot of things and the don't
have any money and we are probably the easiest place to shift it
to,'' Scheppach told reporters.
   ``I think in general what happens is when you get the mandate
you do one of two things,'' he said. ``You cut other programs
and@or you raise taxes to cover it.''
   The report said that in 1988, 30 states had ending balances
greater than the 5 percent of expenditures that is generally
recommended as a safeguard against a downturn in the economy.
   Only 25 states had balances of this size in 1989 and 19 will in
fiscal 1990, the report said.
   It said the total funds available to the 50 states at the end of
the 1990 period will be less than $10 billion, or 3.5 percent of
expenditures.
   ``Even though the states will have to dip into their reserves in
1990, their spending growth will decline from 8.9 percent in 1989
to 7.7 percent in 1990,'' the two organizations said.
   They said 19 states plan to increase spending by 10 percent or
more in 1990 but 13 states would be increasing it by less than 5
percent.
   State revenues overall will increase by an estimated 5.5
percent, compared to 8.3 percent in 1989, reflecting an assumption
that national economic growth will slow, the report said.

   The show must go on, so Don Johnson was
back on the set of his latest movie and passing out cigars two
hours after his wife, actress Melanie Griffith, gave birth to a
daughter.
   Johnson was at Brackenridge Hospital when the 5-pound, 14-ounce
girl named Dakota was born at 2:49 p.m. Wednesday. He was back at
the set for the Dennis Hopper-directed movie ``The Hot Spot'' by 5
p.m. and resumed filming until the end of the day.
   ``He is thrilled, of course,'' said Lauren Hyman, unit publicist
for the movie, which is being shot near Austin. ``But there will be
no break in filming.''
   Johnson, 39, who was a star of the TV series ``Miami Vice,''
married Miss Griffith, 31, for the second time last June. They each
have a young son from other relationships. Miss Griffith was
nominated for an Academy Award for the hit movie ``Working Girl.''

   Some of the biggest names in country
music including The Judds, Barbara Mandrell, Ronnie Milsap and the
Statler Brothers have agreed to perform at a concert to benefit
victims of Hurricane Hugo.
   Ricky Skaggs and George Jones also are scheduled to perform at
the Dec. 13 concert at the 11,000-seat Jacksonville, Fla., Veterans
Memorial Coliseum.
   Kathy Gangwisch, a spokeswoman for the Statler Brothers, who are
organizing the concert, said the entertainers have waived their
performance fees and will pay all their expenses.
   Tickets are $20 and proceeds will go to the South Carolina Hugo
Relief Fund, Gangwisch said Friday.
   Gangwisch said Jacksonville was chosen for the concert because
the city agreed to waive its rental fee for the coliseum and
because appropriate facilities in South Carolina were not available.

   Lord Linley, the 27-year-old nephew of Queen
Elizabeth II, has been banned from driving for the third time in
two years.
   Magistrates at Brentford in west London disqualified him from
driving for four months and fined him the equivalent of $320 on
Thursday for riding his motorcycle at 75 to 80 mph in a 40 mph zone
in August.
   He was banned from driving twice in 1987, also for speeding.
   It was Linley's ninth driving offense and he holds the dubious
distinction of having the worst driving record in Britain's royal
family.
   Linley, the son of Princess Margaret, is a furniture designer
and partner in a fashionable Chelsea restaurant.
   Linley left the court in a chauffeur-driven car for Heathrow
Airport, and flew to Tokyo for business engagements.

   Anatoly Karpov moved into a 2-1 lead in the World
Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal today after his fellow
Soviet Artur Yusupov resigned their adjourned third round game
without resuming play.
   Play had been adjourned after six hours of battle Thursday with
Karpov holding an overwhelming advantage in an endgame.
   Yvette Nagel, a match official, said Yusupov gave up this
morning.
   The winner of the Candidates' cycle will challenge world
champion Garri Kasparov for his title in a 24-game match in October
1990. The winners of the eight-game semifinal contests will face
off in the Candidates' final in March.
   In the second semifinal, Jan Timman of the Netherlands was
leading British Grandmaster Jon Speelman 2-1. Their first game was
drawn, Timman won the second and their third game, on Thursday, was
drawn. Play resumes Saturday.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   Karpov's victory followed an exciting zig-zag struggle in which
Yusupov appeared on the verge of a dramatic triumph over Karpov,
who held the world title for 10 years until losing to Kasparov in
1985.
   But in the final minutes of play on Thursday, Yusupov's nerve
snapped. He made a grave mistake on the 59th move and lost a bishop.
   ``This victory will be like an ointment for Karpov to relieve
the psychological shock of Kasparov's brilliant result in
Tilburg,'' said Leonto Garcia, a prominent Spanish chess
commentator.
   On Monday, Kasparov won a top-notch tournament in the Dutch port
city with a crushing score of 12 points out of 14.
   The result is likely to catapult the 26-year-old titleholder
past America's Bobby Fischer as the highest ranked player of all
time, when the biannual international ranking list is published on
January 1.
   For the past five years, Karpov, 38, and Kasparov have been
locked in a bitter personal and professional battle stretching over
a record-shattering four world title bouts.
   Karpov is favorite to win the Candidates' cycle and faceoff
against Kasparov for a fifth time.
   ``Karpov has been badly off form in this match. He was in
trouble in the second game as well,'' Garcia said. ``But now he's
won a game he will be able to pull himself up. He's very likely to
win the match now.''
   If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, two further games will be
played, followed, if necesary, by sudden death tiebreakers at
increasignly high speeds
   In the fourth round on Saturday, Karpov will play with the
advantage of the white pieces against Yusupov, while Speelman will
faceoff with white against Timman.

<HEAD>Disney Negotiating Settlement in Vulture Abuse Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney World is negotiating with
prosecutors to settle charges that the amusement park abused wild
birds, particularly vultures, that invaded its zoological park,
lawyers said.
   U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth Jenkins agreed Thursday to postpone
Disney's arraignment on federal charges for 30 days after both
sides said they thought they could reach a plea agreement.
   State and federal charges were filed against the central Florida
theme park last month after the deaths of vultures and the alleged
mistreatment of other birds at Discovery Island, an 11-acre
zoological site.
   Disney has said the wild birds were attacking animals, stealing
their food, defecating on park boardwalks and making too much noise.
   Disney and five employees were charged with 13 state
misdemeanors and three federal counts. Included were allegations
that workers beat vultures to death; held dozens of them in a
small, overheated shed with little food and water; shot hawks and
falcons; and knocked eggs from the nests of egrets and ibises.
   Disney officials have refused to comment on the charges.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Roberto Moreno said a fine and some
assurance that Disney won't abuse wild birds may be part of the
settlement.
   Disney attorney Robert Eagan would not comment after the
hearing. He told the magistrate it was likely an agreement could be
reached.
   State attorney's spokesman Randy Means confirmed negotiations
were continuing in the state cases, but refused to give specifics.
   Disney officials last week announced a series of changes at
Discovery Island, including a new manager and a new environmental
advisory committee.
   The head of investigations for the Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission said his office has agreed to meet with Disney
officials next week to discuss how to legally solve the company's
problem with vultures.

   Throwing fire ants wouldn't have been
much of a spectator sport, admittedly, but why rubber chickens?
   ``You get the humane society on you if you use symbols of
lovable pets and tossing rubber frogs would be too much like Kermit
and would upset the kids,'' said Harris County District Judge
Bonnie Leggat. She is chairwoman of the chicken-throwing event,
expected to be a highlight of the seventh annual FireAnt Festival
Oct. 14.
   ``We haven't got any complaints,'' she said. ``Apparently,
chickens are not thought of too fondly by anybody. After all,
Chicken Little was a dingbat.''
   The sport originally was conceived as an exhibition between
local politicians two years ago.
   ``We found out they could throw bull, but not chicken,'' said
George Smith, publisher of the Marshall News-Messenger and one of
organizers of the festival, which has been growing every year and
is expected to have an attendance of 50,000 this year. That's
people, not ants.
   The chickens _ regulation rubber imports from Taiwan _ have been
made more aerodynamic by stuffing them with old pantyhose, thus
answering the age-old question of which came first _ the chicken or
the L'eggs.
   Rigid rules require contestants to throw the chickens like a
football.
   ``We won't let them fling them around like a discus, because
their necks pop off and pantyhose goes flying anywhere,'' Ms.
Leggat said.
   Mike Whitworth of Marshall holds the chicken toss record of 109
feet, 6 inches, set in 1987. He revealed his winning technique:
``If you get its little beak up in the wind, then that little
sucker can sail.''
   This year's festival also includes a fire ant calling contest, a
beverage coaster throw, a face-making contest and the Texas Open
Diaper Derby. A 26-foot-tall anteater balloon will make its debut
this year.
   Country singer Lee Greenwood will be grand marshal of the parade
that opens the event. He will perform a concert in the evening.

   A spokesman said it was difficult for
judges to select the winning entries from the hundreds of beauties
submitted for a 1990 calendar, but 14 pinups were finally chosen.
   Dewey McIlrath's pride and joy, a bright orange 1935
Allis-Chalmers WC tractor, was one of the winners. It will be
featured in a 1990 Classic Farm Tractor Calendar, printed by the Du
Pont chemical company.
   ``My late father-in-law, Ed Spinn, bought this tractor new for
$635 and farmed with it for many years,'' said McIlrath, a farmer
and businessman. ``My brother, Bud, is also a collector, and he
rebuilt this engine and helped with the restoration.''
   The engine of McIlrath's general-purpose tractor has a magneto
ignition system that requires hand cranking to start.
   The tractor was displayed at the Farm Progress Show in
Rochester. It is one of two Indiana tractors in the calendar, which
features 14 tractors built in the 1920s and 1930s.
   Du Pont spokesman John Harvey said it was difficult to select
just 14 tractors from the hundreds of photos submitted.
   ``We easily could have produced several calendars with just
Indiana tractors,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   ``CBS This Morning,'' a perennial third in
morning-show ratings, is getting a new executive producer and its
current one is being promoted, CBS News said Friday.
   David Corvo will be succeeded as executive producer of both the
daily program and earlier ``CBS Morning News,'' by Erik Sorenson,
vice president and station manager of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los
Angeles.
   Corvo, who began his CBS career at KCBS-TV in 1975, was named
vice president for administration at CBS News by the division's
president, David Burke, who disclosed the changes in a statement.
   Burke said that Ted Savaglio, who holds the job Corvo will get,
and also is the network's deputy director of news coverage, will
become a senior producer at ``CBS This Morning.''
   Corvo has been executive producer of ``CBS This Morning,''
co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, since its
premiere on Nov. 30, 1987.
   It was the successor to ``The Morning Program,'' an
entertainment-oriented bid by CBS to boost morning ratings. That
show, with actress Mariette Hartley and Rolland Smith, was a
ratings flop and was dropped in 10 months.
   CBS News, which didn't produce that show, had hoped ``CBS This
Morning'' would slowly build an audience. But it has remained a
distant third in ratings.
   NBC News' established ``Today'' show, although reportedly
suffering internal troubles and speculation that co-anchor Jane
Pauley wants to leave, still leads in the ratings, followed by
``Good Morning America,'' produced by ABC's entertainment division.
    According to the most recent A.C. Nielsen Co. daytime ratings
``Today'' led with a 4.3 rating in the week ending Sept. 29. ABC's
show had a 3.9, and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.4. Each ratings point
now represents 921,000 homes.

<HEAD>Atheists to Honor Man Who Instigated Lawsuit Over Prayers at Football
Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Jager, whose son's lawsuit led to a court
decision that has halted prayers at many high school football
games, will be honored at a convention of atheists and agnostics
this weekend.
   Jager, of Douglasville, is to be named Freethinker of the Year
by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a 3,400-member group based
in Madison, Wis.
   Jager's son, Doug, sued the county school system in 1986 to halt
prayers before Douglas County High School football games. After he
won before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear the case in May, many school systems
stopped pregame prayers.
   The elder Jager, 53, said he would never have forced the issue
if other students had not harassed his son, a band member, for not
reciting the prayers. When school officials did not address his
concerns, Jager suggested that his son sue.
   The elder Jager later became active in the Freedom From Religion
Foundation, founded in 1978 to work to keep church and state
separate and to teach the public about atheism.
   Tom Malone, the group's Southeast region vice president and a
social studies teacher at Clarkston High School, said members do
not try to persuade people to leave the church and do not support
governmental opposition to religion.
   Malone said the convention will feature several Georgia speakers.
   ``We anticipated that, since our organization is based in
Madison, Wis., some people would accuse the organization of being
outside agitators,'' he said. ``We wanted to show some of our
home-grown concerns.''
   Expected participants include:
   _Dr. Ken Saladin, a biology professor at Georgia College, who
was turned down for a Scout den leadership position because he
would not sign an oath acknowledging the importance of a belief in
God.
   _Columbus radio station manager J. Edward Wilson, who left the
Seventh-day Adventist Church after years as a minister.
   _Butterfly McQueen, a Georgia resident who played Prissy in the
film ``Gone With the Wind,'' who will receive a Heroine Award for
her advocacy of free thought.

<HEAD>Reformists, Centrists Clash at Historic Party Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberal Communists and their more
orthodox counterparts clashed Friday at a historic party congress,
with reformers calling for an end to orthodox Communism and their
rivals emphasizing loyalty to past values.
   By deciding how much their party should change, delegates at the
four-day congress will influence the political future of Hungary.
With its commitment to free elections by next year, the country is,
along with Poland, at the forefront of reform in the Soviet bloc.
   While reformists seek to discard orthodox Marxist concepts in
favor of a democratic party that can compete in a multiparty
system, the conservatives only want to modify existing beliefs and
structures.
   ``We must say goodbye to the political mummies'' who refuse to
accept change, said Attila Agh, a leader of the rank-and-file
reformist faction at the congress.
   ``The old is no longer viable, the present is stagnating, and
the new is just being born,'' he said.
   The agreement between opposition groups and the mostly
reform-minded Communist leadership to hold the country's first free
elections in 47 years could be endangered if conservatives slow
full-fledged liberalization.
   They could do so by persuading delegates to vote for
traditionalists instead of reformists in key party posts, and by
turning down draft documents outlining a new, liberal party as a
replacement for the traditional Communist model.
   Sounding the reform theme in a keynote address, party chairman
Rezsoe Nyers urged the 1,279 delegates to effectively terminate the
70-year-old party and replace it with one based on democratic
values.
   ``The historic role of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party has
reached an end here,'' said Nyers, using the formal name of the
Communist Party.
   ``It is my belief that the new party cannot be Communist,'' said
Nyers. He said that instead it should combine communism with social
democratic beliefs, such as those of European leftist parties or
the British Labor Party.
   Nyers did not expand on this, and other reformists told
reporters the definition of ``democratic socialism'' still had to
be debated by the congress.
   A Central Committee draft document made available to reporters
said ``Democratic Socialism'' would mean the party would support:
   _ A multiparty system.
   _ Referendums and other instruments of direct democracy.
   _ Prevention of excessive centralization of power.
   _ A freely elected Parliament.
   _ Election of a president strenthening the balance between
different branches of power and of a government responsible to
Parliament.
   Nyers, a moderate reformer, has attempted to bridge differences
between conservative and liberal colleagues since a four-man party
leadership was formed in June to try to respond to growing
ideological rifts.
   His comments appeared closer to the reform line touted by
co-leaders Imre Pozsgay and Premier Miklos Nemeth than to Karoly
Grosz, the most conservative of the collective leadership.
   Nyers echoed standard demands by Pozsgay and Nemeth that those
who cannot accept fundamental change leave the party, and he
suggested a name change that does not contain the word ``Workers''
to reflect a broader base.
   Behind the podium a giant slogan proclaimed ``Democracy, A
Constitutional State, Socialism'' as congress goals.
   It was a stark contrast to the slogan of the last congress in
1985: ``Continue Proceeding Along The Leninist Path.''
   Grosz cautioned against too much change, saying: ``We should not
deny our Communist ideals.''
   In a veiled attack on rivals Pozsgay and Nemeth, he said the
intolerance of senior leaders to differing opinions smacks of ``old
Stalinist practices, even if they're covered with the sweet glaze
of reformism.''

<HEAD>Wright Brothers Sites to Get Federal Preservation Study</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will study sites
where the Wright brothers lived and worked in a move that could
lead to a national park in the birthplace of aviation, officials
said Friday.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said the National Park Service study,
expected to take 12 to 15 months, will help Congress decide whether
to confer national park status on the sites.
   A committee headed by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice was
formed to preserve the heritage of Orville and Wilbur Wright, who
developed the first heavier-than-air flying machine.
   ``Over the years ... we have lost many of the buildings, many of
the historic sites involved in the birth of aviation either to the
wrecking ball or to just plain indifference,'' Rice said. ``That
time is over.''
   The sites to be studied include Huffman Prairie, scene of the
Wright brothers' first flying experiments, and buildings that
housed the Wrights' airplane company, bicycle shop and printing
business.
   Also on the list are Hawthorne Hill, home of Orville Wright;
Carillon Park, home of the Wright Flyer III, known as the world's
first practical airplane; and Dunbar House, home of Paul Lawrence
Dunbar, poet and friend of the Wright brothers.
   William Gibson, a National Park Service official based in
Chillicothe, said the agency will study options for managing the
sites, including oversight by the state or local government, the
private sector, or the federal government in the form of a national
park.
   ``We are impressed,'' said Gibson. ``The historic resources
associated with the Wright brothers that remain in Dayton are truly
impressive.''
   The city of Dayton and Montgomery County plan to contribute
$35,000 apiece toward the study. Private contributions will also be
sought, officials said.
   While the Wright brothers constructed their early aircraft at
their bicycle shop in Dayton, they also are connected historically
with Kitty Hawk, N.C., where on Dec. 17, 1903, they made the first
controlled, sustained flights in a power-driven airplane.

   President Bush emerged today from surgery to
remove a cyst on his right middle finger saying, ``All is well.''
   Bush was operated on as an outpatient at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center for removal of the cyst, which has troubled him for
several years. He was given a local anesthetic.
   Holding his bandaged hand stiffly upright, Bush told reporters
following the hour-long operation, ``All is well.'' He said he felt
``just fine'' and had experienced no pain during the surgery.
   ``It was real minor,'' he said of the surgery.
   On emerging from the hospital, Bush defended his handling of
events surrounding a failed coup against Panamanian leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega. He told reporters he does not regret his
decision against intervening militarily, adding, ``there was never
a chance to have him (Noriega) handed over to us.''
   Bush arrived by helicopter, smiling, waving at reporters, and
holding up the hand on which the surgery was to be performed.
   ``It's not really painful, but it's a nuisance in the sense that
it's large enough to cause him some anxiety,'' presidential press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   The president, during a picture-taking session with Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi on Thursday, told reporters there was no
need to make ``a federal case of it'' and joked, ``I will show you
my scar afterwards.''
   Asked to raise his middle finger to demonstrate the cyst for a
photo, Bush said with a laugh: ``Don't tempt me.''
   However, he then held out his right hand in a downward direction.
   He was also asked by reporters if the surgery would interfere
with the duties of his office or keep him from going to a World
Series game.
   ``No, no, life goes on. I will continue through this awesome
burden, continue what I'm doing,'' he said.
   The cyst, on the end of his finger just above the nail, has
troubled the president for about three years. ``It simply has
reached the point where it has gotten larger and noticeable,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said the president, who is left-handed, would be given a
local anesthetic called a digital nerve block and would remain
awake throughout the procedure.
   ``The doctors' clinical observation indicates that the cyst is
benign. There will of course be a routine pathologic examination of
the tissue,'' Fitzwater added.
   He said that while Bush's doctors considered it a routine
procedure, ``It requires hospitalization.''
   ``It requires an incision and then, of course, the cyst can be
in the finger and you never know how much _ what it takes to get
out of there once you get in,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush's cyst is a quarter-inch in diameter and rises about an
eighth of an inch above the surface of the finger, with a root that
extends under the skin back toward the finger joint, said White
House aide Stephen Hart.
   The surgery was being performed by Col. Allen Smith, chief of
hand surgery at Walter Reed, and George Bogumill, who occupies a
similar post at Georgetown University Hospital.
   The last time Bush was in the hospital was May 10 when he
underwent a routine physical examination. At that time, the cyst
was drained and doctors said it had been present for many years and
did not present a medical problem.
   In 1986, Bush, who was then vice president, had a basal cell
skin cancer removed from his face. The same year, he had a small,
non-cancerous polyp removed from his colon.
   Bush planned a weekend trip to the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md. He will go to Baltimore on Sunday to address a group of
Republican Women, and then return to Camp David and remain there
until Monday afternoon.

<HEAD>U.N. Group Discusses Options for Dealing with Global Warming</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. group on global warming completed work
Friday on a list of possible actions countries could take to
control the emission of gases that cause the so-called greenhouse
effect.
   The working group, which concluded a weeklong session Friday,
did not make specific recommendations. It simply compiled a list of
options that it will submit to its parent body, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is scheduled to
meet in February in Washington. The list was not released.
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established
last year by the U.N. Environment Program and the World
Meteorological Organization.
   The working group is one of three that are examining the problem
of global warming caused by the greenhouse effect, with the aim of
eventually drafting an international convention on global warming.
   According to the greenhouse theory, temperatures around the
world are slowly rising because of a buildup of gases that is
allowing sunlight into the atmosphere but preventing heat from
escaping. Although the theory is widely accepted, scientists differ
over whether the greenhouse effect is causing global warming now or
whether that will happen sometime in the future.
   The 43-nation working group discussed ``many of the options that
would go into forming a framework agreement'' on global warming but
did not actually work on drafting a convention, the chairman, Dr.
Frederick Bernthal of the United States, said at a news conference.
   The three main gases thought to cause the greenhouse effect are
carbon dioxide, which is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels;
methane, which comes from a variety of sources including leakage
from coal mines and pipelines; and chloroflourocarbons, or CFCs,
used in refrigeration and aerosol sprays.
   A vice chairman of the group, Jiein Luo of China, said that
while emissions from industrialized countries have stabilized, it
is ``unavoidable'' that those from developing countries will
increase. He said it is therefore necessary to ``protect the
environment and climate on the one hand, but on the other hand not
to hurt the development of these economies.''
   Bernthal said financial assistance and technology transfers from
industrialized countries to the developed world could help solve
the problem, but there is no clear estimate of how much money will
be needed.

   President Bush said today does not regret his
decision against intervening militarily in this week's failed coup
against Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama, adding, ``there was
never a chance to have him handed over to us.''
   ``We reviewed all the information and I don't see anything now
that would have made me make a different decision then,'' Bush told
reporters as he emerged from Walter Reed Army Medical Center after
minor surgery on his finger.
   He said he still wants to see Noriega removed from power. The
Panamanian military leader faces federal drug charges in Florida.
   Bush offered a defense of his handling of the coup as two top
administration officials were called by lawmakers to answer
questions in closed session about the affair.
   ``I'm not just being stubborn, but as I look at all the
information I wouldn't have made a different decision then,'' Bush
said.
   Noting the criticism by many in Congress that he didn't use the
12,000 U.S. military personnel in Panama to help rebellious
officers of the Panamanian Defense Forces in the short-lived revolt
on Tuesday, Bush said he knew that some wanted him ``to unleash the
full military to go in and get Noriega.''
   He said he could have ``gone to general quarters but that is not
prudent'' under the circumstances.
   The president said he still wants to see Noriega removed from
power, but ``there was never a chance to have him handed over to
us'' during the attempted coup.
   The vigorous public defense by Bush and his aides of the
administration's actions contrasted with private acknowledgements
by admininistration officials that the United States was guilty of
shortcomings in intelligence matters and other areas.
   ``I hope we will have learned some things from this and be a
little better next time,'' one senior official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Thursday.
   Bush was asked today about reports that the administration had
an information gap during the coup attempt and was in a state of
confusion due to conflicting and garbled reports from Panama.
   The president said he had been engaged in ``almost a running
meeting'' on the matter throughout Tuesday. As to whether he had
sufficient information and intelligence, he said, ``I don't feel I
can factually answer that.''
   Bush was asked whether Panamanians who want to make future coup
attempts against Noriega could have any assurance that he might
back them militarily.
   He did not answer directly but said, ``I would not rule out any
option, but you have to look at the facts. You have to keep in mind
the lives of American citizens ... but I wouldn't rule that out.''
   He added that his decision not to use force in this case was
because ``it wasn't warranted under the existing circumstances.''
   ``The commander-in-chief must have the lives of American
citizens foremost in mind when making such a decision,'' Bush said.
   He said ``it's simply not true'' that the insurgents offered to
turn Noriega over to U.S. authorities.
   As the administration mounted its defense, the nation's top
military leaders went before Senate committees investigating the
administration's actions, including whether rebel troops sought
U.S. support while the uprising was in progress.
   The Intelligence and Armed Services committees met in closed
session with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Army Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to press for the
details.
   After the three-hour session, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., quoted
Cheney and Powell as saying they ``basically ... would not have
changed their decision and recommendations to the president, based
on what they know today.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the Intelligence Committee chairman,
said he already was having difficulty because the White House was
resisting authorizing the CIA to give his panel a detailed
chronology of events.
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
``feels that we did the best we could with the information
available and he feels he made the right decisions.''
   Even with the benefit of hindsight, the president wouldn't do
anything differently, Fitzwater said, contradicting a statement a
day earlier by the senior administration official.
   For the first time, the administration publicly pinpointed the
wife of coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi as the person who tipped
off U.S. officials about the planned coup. She contacted U.S.
officials last Sunday, Fitzwater said, disputing a Wall Street
Journal report that she had made contact three weeks ago.
   The Journal said Adella Bonilla de Giroldi on Sunday night
arranged for a meeting between her husband and two officials from
the CIA. It said the CIA had confidence in the rebels but the U.S.
military did not.
   Fitzwater backpedaled from an earlier statement that the only
advance contact was through third parties. He said U.S. officials
also were in touch with Giroldi himself on Sunday. U.S. officials
believe Giroldi was killed after the coup attempt.
   Discussing the Senate investigation, Boren said Thursday,
``We're going to get to the bottom of this,'' including the
question of whether Panamanian rebels offered to release Noriega to
U.S. officials during the four- or five-hour period they had him in
custody.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., disputed the administration's
assertion that the rebels refused to release Noriega, saying,
``They (the rebels) told the U.S. officers that they were holding
Noriega captive, and requested U.S. assistance to take custody of
Noriega and remove him to the United States.''
   However, Defense Secretary Cheney said the rebels refused in a
``face-to-face contact'' with a U.S. military officer to turn over
Noriega during the coup attempt.
   A variety of officials said Tuesday's coup effort was doomed by
a series of false assumptions and mistaken judgments by the rebels
as well as by the American forces' lack of flexibility.
   One U.S. official said American forces in Panama were prepared
for any contingency _ ``from the maximum all the way to the
minimum.'' But the official said constraints were placed on Gen.
Maxwell Thurman of the Southern Command, who assumed his duties in
Panama just two days before the insurrection.
   The senior administration official, asked if the White House
wished it had done things differently, replied, ``Yeah, a few
things.
   ``This is our first bloodletting, if you will, first real time
of kind of a crisis operation,'' the official said. ``And every
administration has a shakedown in one way or another and we've
learned some things about our operation that we need to improve.
And we'll improve them.''

   A man sought in the fatal shootings of two
fellow church deacons and the wounding of a third in Texas turned
himself in as authorities were getting closer to finding him, the
FBI said Friday.
   Gerald King, 30, was jailed under $100,000 cash bond after being
arrested Thursday on charges of unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution.
   Robert Siller, agent in charge of the Dayton FBI office, said
King's mother and stepfather live in Dayton.
   ``We attempted to locate him at various relatives' residences,''
Siller said. ``He was basically one place ahead of us. He really
wasn't running. It's just that we were getting closer and closer.''
   Siller said King's parents told the FBI their son originally
intended to surrender in Dallas.
   King, a deacon at the Living Testimony Baptist Church in Dallas,
was wanted in connection with the shooting of three fellow deacons
Sunday after an argument apparently erupted among the men in the
church's finance room. Investigators haven't disclosed what
prompted the argument, and the Rev. Robert Simmons, the church's
pastor, said he doesn't know.
   Siller said King would not talk to agents about the shootings.
   The funerals Saturday of Jack Earl Ray, 51, and Artis Weaver,
60, will be the first meeting at the church since the shootings.
Billy Weaver, 39, the wounded deacon, was released from a hospital
Monday.

<HEAD>Government Unveils Plans for Creating Market Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's new government Friday announced
plans for a market economy, warning of tight money, bankruptcy and
unemployment along the way but promising to soften the pain with
unemployment benefits.
   ``What we must do is a quick transformation of the present
economic system into a market system ... that can spur human
initiative and bring a gradual improvement of living conditions,''
Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said.
   ``We have a great and unrepeatable chance to pass to a ...
system whose effectiveness is proven all over the world. But we
have to do it in a very difficult economic situation.''
   Balcerowicz detailed the preliminary plan one day after it was
approved by the Council of Ministers chaired by Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The non-communist government has been in power
only 25 days.
   Western countries stand ready to help Poland and if the measures
are put into effect, beneficial effects could be discernible within
a year, Balcerowicz said.
   Poland has been suffering from inflation that has reached 50
percent a month, as well as an alarming drop in production of meat,
coal and industrial goods.
   Officials of the International Monetary Fund will come to Poland
on Oct. 16 and a crucial standby loan agreement should be signed
with the lending group by the end of November, he said.
   The agreement, in which Poland would commit itself to the
detailed program of restructuring and internal stabilization, would
signal the start of new Western loans and restructuring of Poland's
$40 billion Western debt.
   The plan's presentation was the most detailed explanation yet to
the Polish public of the sacrifices to expect under the stringent
reforms advocated by the East bloc's first non-communist government.
   The plan's basic thesis is that only by quickly converting
Poland to a market economy can the country's economic crisis be
solved. Previous remedies such as price controls, ration coupons
and centralized distribution would only worsen the problems and
delay the cure, he said.
   The plan forsees a preliminary phase lasting until Dec. 31,
followed by decisive action beginning early next year, Balcerowicz
told reporters.
   The first phase involves loosening state ownership of property,
breaking up monopolies, reforming the state budget, changing the
banking system, creating unemployment benefits and other social
security measures and making state enterprises more efficient.
   The government will counter monopolistic ``abuse'' of prices
through administrative means and the excessive growth of wages with
legislation to reduce wage indexation, Balcerowicz said.
   ``We must introduce a wage-and-price policy that will stop the
inflationary process,'' he said. ``Without approval of this point,
I can see no chance for leading Poland out of its crisis.''
   In the ``decisive'' phase beginning next year, he said, the
government means to stifle inflation, privatize many state-owned
enterprises, create a bond and stock market as well as a a new
budget system and a new tax system.
   The government also will cut off credit and subsidies, which
will lead to bankruptcies and economic problems for some
enterprises, Balcerowicz said.
   ``Some enterprises will run out of money. And this is a
necessary element of all successful programs to get out of violent
inflation,'' he said.
   Balcerowicz was unable to estimate the unemployment rate but
said it could climb to between 10 percent to 20 percent in the
worst case.
   Once changes are in place and the agreement with the IMF is
signed, he said, prices gradually will stabilize and living
standards will begin to improve. ``The situation is not hopeless.
There is a chance for real improvement.''

<HEAD>Savimbi Proposes Plan For Truce Monitored By Other African States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said Friday
he had proposed to the United States a cease-fire plan that would
involve other African states in the monitoring of the truce
compliance.
   Savimbi said the plan he presented earlier in the day to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and to President Bush on
Thursday would now be passed to Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko,
who has been serving as the mediator between the Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the Soviet-backed Angolan
government.
   If the proposal is accepted by the Angolan government, a truce
accord can be signed before the end of the month, sources said.
   The sources, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the
truce proposal also includes agreement that the troops would not
receive new weapons during the cease-fire, that all hostile
propaganda would stop and that political prisoners be released by
both sides to the international community.
   Savimbi, speaking at the National Press Club at the end of a
week of meetings with officials and lawmakers, said he had arranged
to meet ``very soon'' with Mobutu in order to iron out their
problems and get the negotiations with Angola back on track.
   Mobutu and Savimbi have been feuding over the interpretation of
the Zairean-mediated truce accord, which collapsed soon after it
was reached last June. Savimbi denies he agreed to go into exile,
while Mobutu appears to be backing Angola's claim that he did. The
United States is backing Savimbi's version.
   There were some problems with President Mobutu ``but those
problems _ we consider them on the way to being solved,'' Savimbi
said.
   ``We got a commitment that the United States government will be
more involved ... as a supporting force to help the mediator,'' he
added.
   Baker expressed his ``unswerving'' support for UNITA and ``our
strong desire that direct negotiations between UNITA and (Angola)
resume without preconditions,'' said a State Department statement.
   He also ``reiterated our support for national reconciliation and
UNITA's goal for free and fair elections,'' the statement said.
   Angola has rejected direct negotiations with Savimbi, as well as
free elections.

   Two more victims of a fishing boat
explosion in the Gulf of Mexico were recovered Friday, bringing to
10 the number of people killed earlier this week when the vessel
struck a submerged natural gas pipeline.
   The bodies were discovered by search aircraft near Sea Rim State
Park, about 10 miles from the scene of Tuesday night's blast. One
man remained missing and was presumed dead.
   Three men survived the blast. Two remained hospitalized Friday,
one in critical condition and one in good condition. The third
survivor, Capt. Darreyl Wayne Gough, 31, of Sulphur, La., was
released from the hospital Thursday and was to be interviewed by a
National Transportation Safety Board team sometime Friday, said
NTSB spokesman Mike Benson.
   ``We also should have some idea of what divers found and give us
an idea of the condition of the pipe and hull,'' Benson said.
``We're also talking to the pipeline company about caretaking of
that pipe. And we're talking to the fishing company to get an idea
of their operations.''
   The 160-foot North Umberland was in only four to six feet of
water when it struck the 16-inch pipeline, triggering a fire that
sent flames hundreds of feet in the air.
   Safety board members would not speculate on a cause for the
accident until more evidence was gathered.
   Although some officials have suggested that the boat's fishing
nets became snagged on the pipeline, rupturing it to cause the
explosion, an NTSB shipboard inspection Thursday found the nets
stored inside the vessel.
   The interstate pipeline, installed in 1973 and regulated by the
U.S. Department of Transportation, is required to be at least 36
inches below the Gulf floor. It is owned by Natural Gas Pipeline of
America Inc., based in Lombard, Ill.

<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers Friday
prevented seven European diplomats from visiting a Palestinian town
that has been the target of tax raids. An Arab teen-ager died of
wounds sustained in an army clash.
   Shops and offices were closed throughout the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip for a second consecutive day in a strike called to
show solidarity with residents of Beit Sahour, where Israeli tax
raids have been under way for two weeks.
   The underground leadership of the 22-month-old Palestinian
uprising called for three more days of strikes starting Monday, the
Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
   The diplomats, all consuls general from Jerusalem, were stopped
at a military checkpoint on the edge of Bethlehem and told that
Beit Sahour, a nearby town of about 10,000 people, was a ``closed
military zone.''
   The army frequently closes areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
to keep outsiders away, including reporters and residents of other
areas.
   British Consul General Ivan Callan said the diplomats were
invited by Beit Sahour's mayor, Hanna Atrash, to see the problems
created by the government's repeated tax raids.
   ``It is part of our duty to discover what is going on,'' Callan
said. ``I think it is a mistake to prevent us from entering.''
   The other diplomats represent Belgium, France, Greece, Spain,
Sweden and Italy.
   The incident was the latest in a test of wills between Israel
and the Palestinians of Beit Sahour.
   The Israeli military government launched the tax raids to try to
make an example of the town, where compliance with a tax boycott
has been almost universal. Non-payment of taxes has been a frequent
tactic of the uprising.
   On Tuesday, soldiers declared part of Arab east Jerusalem a
closed military zone to prevent the holding of a Palestinian press
conference on Beit Sahour's problems.
   The army said in a statement Friday the diplomats were blocked
because ``radical elements are trying to mobilize support from
outside the area, with the help of international bodies that
encourage their actions and the media, while they increase their
violent activities.''
   The statement said this interfered with ``the legitimate
activity of collecting taxes and the efforts of soldiers to restore
quiet.''
   Atrash said the consensus in the town was ``no taxation under
occupation.''
   He estimated that more than $500,000 worth of furniture and
machinery has been confiscated during the raids on the town, which
is prosperous from scores of family-owned shops.
   Atrash said in a telephone interview he appreciated the
diplomats' efforts.
   ``I think that the diplomats' acceptance of the invitation and
their effort to come shows the political support of our people, not
only in Beit Sahour but also in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,'' he
said. ``It is a victory.''
   In Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, Hamad Shami, 17, died of a
gunshot wound to the chest suffered Thursday when soldiers fired at
youths stoning trains, hospital officials said.
   Shami's death raised to 585 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli troops or civilians during the uprising against Israeli
occupation. Another 127 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty
Israelis have died.

<HEAD>Trial For Exxon Skipper Likely to Move Out of Valdez</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys agree
the trial of the skipper of the tanker Exxon Valdez should be moved
from the port city of Valdez but where the trial will be held has
not been decided.
   Former Exxon Capt. Joseph Hazelwood faces misdemeanor charges of
operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of pollutants as a result of the nation's worst
oil spill. A felony indictment charges him with three counts of
second-degree criminal mischief.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., is scheduled for trial in
January. He is free on $50,000 bail.
   The tanker was under Hazelwood's command on March 24 when it ran
aground on Bligh Reef after he turned the controls over to the
vessel's third mate. More than 11 million gallons of thick crude
oil spilled into Prince William Sound.
   Defense lawyers Richard Friedman and Dick Madson want to move
the trial and Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said the state
supported the move.
   Because of pretrial publicity and the economic impact of the
spill on Valdez, ``we just agreed in the interests of expeditious
proceedings to not go through the hassle of trying to get a jury in
Valdez,'' Cole said.
   Cole said he has asked that the trial be held 125 miles away in
Anchorage, but Friedman said he was unsure that would be a good
choice. ``I think we're moving in the right direction _ away from
Valdez,'' he said.
   Anchorage Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone was assigned the
case this week after Palmer Superior Court Judge Beverly Cutler
disqualified herself. Cutler said litigation handled by her father
and her sister could create the appearance of a conflict of
interest.
   Johnstone is a commercial fisherman who owns a drift gillnet
permit for Bristol Bay. Friedman said Johnstone's fishing was known
when he was assigned the case, and the defense team does not
believe the activity poses a conflict. Fishermen were among those
affected by the spill.

   A military appeals court at Little Rock Air Force Base
overturned Naomi Haye's fraternization conviction last week. It
ordered her reinstated with full back pay of about $75,000, minus
what she has earned in civilian employment since her dismissal from
the service in 1986.
   The tribunal left open the possibility that the former
lieutenant could be retried, although her attorney said another
trial was unlikely. An Air Force spokesman said Wednesday that no
decision had been made.
   ``I don't know what plans they have for me,'' Mrs. Haye, 32,
said Thursday from her home in Guam, where she lives with her
husband, Air Force Sgt. Patrick Haye, and two children.
   A panel of military judges convicted Mrs. Haye at a November
1986 court-martial of two counts of adultery with a fellow officer
and an enlisted man. She was also convicted of fraternization with
the enlisted man.
   The adultery conviction involving the enlisted man was thrown
out after her trial because it duplicated the fraternization
charge. The Air Force Court of Military Review overturned the other
adultery conviction last year.
   Fraternization is defined as a friendly relationship between an
officer and an enlisted person, detrimental to military order and
discipline.
   Neither of the two men was court-martialed or denied promotion,
according to Mrs. Haye's attorney, Morgan Welch.
   Mrs. Haye has contended she was singled out for prosecution
because she was a white officer married to a black enlisted man.
   The appeals court decided Mrs. Haye hadn't received a fair trial.
   ``I'm very relieved,'' Mrs. Haye said Thursday. ``It was a phone
call I was looking forward to.''
   She had been deputy commander of a missile crew at the Little
Rock base.

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 1.1 million metric tons of U.S. corn _
with a potential value of nearly $100 million _ for delivery in
1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The corn sale was the fourth this week to the Soviet Union, with
orders now totaling 3.7 million tons of corn and 100,000 tons of
soybean meal. The seventh year of the agreement began Sunday.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 1.1 million tons
of corn would be more than 43.3 million bushels.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.28 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA's five-day average, meaning that the
latest sale could have a farm value of almost $99 million.

<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Masked kidnappers pushed two Swiss Red
Cross workers into a car Friday and sped into a Palestinian refugee
camp outside this ancient port in south Lebanon, police reported.
   A Palestinian guerrilla spokesman linked the abductions to a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker imprisoned in Switzerland.
   The victims were identified as Emmanuel Christen, 32, and Elio
Erriquez, 23, orthopedic technicians at an artificial limb center
operated by the International Committee of the Red Cross in Sidon,
25 miles south of Beirut.
   None of Lebanon's armed factions claimed responsibility.
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are missing in
Lebanon, most believed to be captives of Shiite Moslems loyal to
Iran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Friday's abductions were the latest of several involving
foreigners working for relief agencies in south Lebanon. Most are
blamed on Fatah-Revolutionary Council, a Palestinian group led by
terrorist Abu Nidal, who broke with PLO chairman Yassir Arafat in
1973.
   Zeid Wehbeh, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said the PLO would ``spare no effort'' to help rescue
the victims.
   Moein Shabaita, spokesman for Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction, the
PLO's main guerrilla component, linked the kidnappings to a
Lebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker, Mohammed Hariri.
   Hariri was jailed for life in February for hijacking an Air
Afrique jetliner July 24, 1987, and killing a French passenger
after the plane landed in Geneva.
   Shabaita said the group that kidnapped Christen and Erriquez was
the same that abducted Swiss Red Cross worker Peter Winkler last
year, ``apparently for the purpose of trying to win Hariri's
release.''
   Winkler was kidnapped Nov. 17 and freed Dec. 16.
   People in Sidon reported seeing a convoy of seven Red Cross cars
with Swiss officials inside heading for Beirut in late afternoon.
Red Cross officials would not say whether the International
Committee, which is based in Geneva, would pull out of Lebanon as
it did last year after another kidnapping.
   Sidon police said Christen and Erriquez were seized at 7:30 a.m.
after arriving at the artificial limb center, which occupies the
ground floor of a four-story building near Ein el-Hilweh, a
Palestinian refugee camp on the southeastern outskirts.
   The relief workers drove there from the International
Committee's downtown headquarters, half a mile away, in a white
sedan identified by the Red Cross insignia on each side and a Red
Cross flag, police reported.
   Armed kidnappers wearing black masks waited in two cars outside
the center, said a police spokesman, whose name was withheld under
standing regulations.
   ``Christen, who was driving, parked outside the center and
climbed out, holding an artificial limb. Erriquez got out the other
door, followed by a Lebanese ICRC employee,'' he said.
   Two kidnappers jumped from a car, one brandishing a pistol and
the other a submachine gun, the spokesman reported.
   ``Christen and Erriquez put their hands up, offering no
resistance,'' he said. They were bundled at gunpoint into the trunk
of the gunmen's Mercedes, which sped off, followed by the other car
packed with gunmen.
   He said several witnesses saw the two cars racing into Ein
el-Hilweh.
   International Committee spokesman Jeorg Bischof said in Geneva
the abduction ``hinders the very important work the Red Cross is
doing in Lebanon.''
   Police said the orthopedic center, which provides artificial
limbs for victims of Lebanon's 14-year-old sectarian civil war, was
closed indefinitely after the abduction.
   Christen, in Lebanon since October 1987, had told friends:
``I've been here so long because I love it. I don't intend to ask
for a transfer.''
   Erriquez, who arrived in April, told colleagues: ``The
experience of working here will be good for me.''
   At least nine relief agency workers _ West Germans,
Scandinavians, Belgians and Swiss _ have been kidnapped in south
Lebanon during the past two years.
   Police and other sources have blamed Abu Nidal, whose real name
is Sabry al-Banna. He has bases at Ein el-Hilweh and in the smaller
Mieh Mieh refugee camp nearby.
   Mustafa Saad, commander of the Nasserite militia, a Sunni Moslem
group that has controlled Sidon throughout the civil war, blamed
Palestinians for the latest abduction but was not more specific.
   ``This is an Ein el-Hilweh affair, not mine,'' he told reporters
after a 10-minute meeting with Roland Sidler, the International
Committee's director in south Lebanon.
   Sidler would not talk to reporters.
   Saad ordered his militiamen to search all cars leaving Sidon.
   The International Committee withdrew its 31 Swiss nationals from
Lebanon on Dec. 20 after death threats from factions that were not
identified.
   Press reports in Switzerland and Lebanon said Winkler's
kidnappers, not identified, had threatened more attacks on Swiss
workers, claiming Swiss authorities reneged on a pledge to pay
ransom for Winkler.
   A 29-member Swiss group returned Jan. 22 after all Lebanese
factions promised there would be no attacks on humanitarian
organizations.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Telephone Strikers Lose Unemployment Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unemployment benefits were revoked Friday for
12,000 striking New England Telephone workers in Massachusetts
under a ruling by a state official.
   Employment and Training Commissioner James F. French ruled the
strike has had a substantial impact on the company's operations,
overturning a decision he made Sept. 13 to grant jobless benefits
to the strikers.
   The latest decision, French said, was not a reversal, but was
based on the cumulative impact on the company of the strike that
began Aug. 6.
   Ed Fitzpatrick, a business agent with Local 2222 of the
International Brotherhood of Machinists, said the union would
appeal French's ruling to the courts on the grounds he did not give
workers a hearing.
   Telephone company spokesman Peter Cronin praised the decision
and said he hoped it would inspire the strikers to return to the
bargaining table.
   ``The decision Sept. 13 to grant benefits was based on the fact
the evidence did not show NET experienced a substantial curtailment
of its business activities,'' French said. ``Now, nine weeks into
the strike, they have provided information that does show a
substantial curtailment in many areas of their company.''
   French said the information provided him by the company was
confidential, but he said it showed service curtailment in areas
such as installations, repairs, cabling, maintenance, construction
and network services.
   French said workers had collected about seven weeks of benefits
and would not have to repay that.
   French said it was rare for his department to grant unemployment
benefits to strikers. He said his initial ruling came because the
telephone company is so heavily automated at first it was not
seriously affected by the walkout of operators, service technicians
and other employees.
   But French said as the strike wore on, the effects mounted.
   He said Massachusetts law, which requires companies to prove a
substantial curtailment of activities before strikers can be denied
jobless benefits, is unusual. Most states, he said, either prohibit
giving strikers unemployment benefits or allow it under most
circumstances.
   The major issue in the strike is a company demand that workers
start paying a portion of their health insurance premiums.

<HEAD>Bush Says He Feels `Just Fine' After Finger Operation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with surgery complete, makes editing

   President Bush underwent minor surgery on
Friday to remove a troublesome cyst from his finger, and said
afterward he felt ``just fine.''
   ``It was real minor,'' Bush told reporters as he left Walter
Reed Army Medical Center holding his right hand with bandaged
middle finger aloft.
   ``All is well,'' he said with a laugh.
   Bush said he had not felt any pain during the 25-minute
operation because he had been administered a local anesthetic,
called digital nerve block anestheisa. It was expected to wear off
three or four hours after the operation, and Bush said the doctors
had told him to expect some pain then.
   The White House said pain medication would be prescribed ``as
necessary.'' Bush left the hospital by helicopter to fly to Camp
David, Md., for the weekend.
   In a statement, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
called the operation ``entirely successful.''
   He said Bush had eight stiches for the 1{-inch incision, and
would wear a splint on the finger for two to three weeks.
   ``No long-term impairmnet of movement in the finger is
expected,'' Fitzwater said.
   The cyst ``appeared benign'' according to White House physician
Dr. Burton Lee, who observed the operation. However, a pathological
examination of the tissue was still under way.
   The White House identified the surgeons as Col. Allen Smith,
chief of hand surgery at Walter Reed, and George Bogumill, who
holds a similar position at Gerogetown University Hospital.
   Smith was to make a follow-up exam of the finger at the White
House on Oct 10.
   Making light of the matter the day before the surgery, Bush had
laughed over it and told reporters not to ``make a federal case of
it.''
   Bush has had the cyst on the middle finger of his right hand for
several years, but it recently came to the point of being
bothersome, Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman told reporters the cyst was ``not really painful,
but it's a nuisance in the sense that it's large enough to cause
him some anxiety.''
   Doctors had drained the cyst on May 10 when Bush underwent a
routine physical examination. The doctors said it had been present
for several years and did not pose a medical problem for the
65-year-old president.
   In recent weeks, Bush, who is left-handed, has been playing
golf, tennis and horseshoes and baiting fishhooks, as well as
signing proclamations, with no apparent difficulty from the cyst.
   The cyst was described as a quarter-inch in diameter, rising
about an eighth of an inch above the surface of the finger, with a
root that extended under the skin back toward the finger joint.
   The president jokingly told reporters ``Don't tempt me'' when
asked to display the finger in question for cameras and
photographers during a photo session Thursday with Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi. He then explained to Savimbi that the finger
is sometimes used for an obscene gesture.
   Bush promised reporters, ``I will show you my scar afterward.''
   Bush's doctors say he is in very good health and exceptionally
good condition for his age, as evidenced by his propensity for
vigorous sports and his often tightly-packed work schedule.
   He had a basal cell skin cancer removed from his face and a
small, noncancerous polyp removed from his colon in 1986, when he
was vice president.

   The space agency told a federal court Friday
there are no safety reasons for stopping next week's launch of a
nuclear-powered probe from the space shuttle and that opponents are
trying to spread ``a tale of horrors.''
   ``There is no evidence that these horrors will in fact or are
likely to occur,'' NASA told U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in a
court filing.
   Gasch has scheduled oral arguments on Tuesday _ two days before
the shuttle Atlantis is to lift off from Kennedy Space Center
carrying into orbit a probe called Galileo, powered by two
24.7-pound nuclear generators.
   To date, NASA has spent $1.5 billion on the project, which will
culminate in six years when the craft begins orbiting the planet
Jupiter. The nuclear devices create electricity for the long
journey and are similar to the ones that powered the Voyager probe
as it swept past Neptune recently.
   A coalition of citizens' groups has sought a court order to stop
the launch, claiming that the danger of plutonium contamination
from a shuttle disaster is far greater than the government has
admitted.
   The groups, led by the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice,
asked Gasch to issue a temporary restraining order and a
preliminary injunction and have threatened to disrupt the launch in
other ways.
   ``In essence, plaintiffs do not like the launch decision and are
trying to get the court to second-guess the executive branch of the
government with regard to the acceptability of risk,'' said the
brief filed by Justice Department lawyer Stuart B. Schoenburg.
   Opponents of the launch warned that the possibilities of an
accident and a deadly plutonium release from Galileo are 1-in-350.
   NASA countered, in Friday's filing, that exhaustive
environmental impact studies showed the most probable accident
statistically would be failure of the rocket that is to propel the
space probe after it is released from the shuttle cargo bay.
   Even if the two thermonuclear power plants reentered Earth's
atmosphere, broke apart on hard rock and released plutonium, NASA
said, there would be no additional cancer deaths over a 70-year
period.
   The space probe's journey to Jupiter will be a complicated one,
involving one slingshot orbit of Venus and two of Earth to gain
momentum, and NASA said the highest potential for human harm would
be if the craft crashed through the atmosphere when it makes its
closest approach to Earth. The chances of that happening are 5 in
10 million.
   ``Under this maximum case scenario, there is a 1 in 10 million
probability of 9.4 excess cancer fatalities worldwide over a
70-year period,'' NASA said and the average individual risk would
be one in 25 billion.
   ``Plaintiffs seem to confuse possibility with probability,'' the
government brief said. ``Instead of focusing upon what is likely to
happen, they dwell upon the worst case which is highly unlikely to
occur.''
   NASA said the protesters ``at best, represent the narrow
concerns of a small segment of the public,'' and come to the court
with ``unclean hands'' because they filed suit just days before the
launch.
   The space agency plans to begin the countdown on Monday as
scheduled, but will halt activities at the 11-hour mark to await
any court action. The shuttle does not get fuel until the final
hours of the countdown.
   The government said ``volumes of safety analyses'' had been
prepared and circulated among experts, that the public at large had
a chance to comment on environmental impact studies and that the
president's science adviser had approved after ``an elaborate
launch approval process.''
   It said the court action ``is an attack on the judgment and
integrity'' of scientists and public officials involved.
   While the action proceeded in court, another group _ Public
Citizen _ circulated a letter it plans to send to individual
members of Congress on Monday. It urges them to intercede in the
launch because ``an explosion similar to the Challenger disaster
could be catastrophic for Florida's heavily populated Atlantic
Coast.''

<HEAD>Missing Russian Violinist Turns Up, Says He Hopes for Asylum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of three Soviet musicians who
disappeared while visiting the Baltimore area last month with a
string ensemble has turned up in Savannah, where he says he hopes
to win asylum.
   Violinist Yuri Alexov disappeared Sept. 28 while visiting Towson
State University with the Leningrad State Conservatory, university
spokeswoman Kathy Williams said Friday. Another member of the
group, Mikhail Istomin, disappeared the same day, and Pyotr Zaytsev
disappeared Sept. 22, she said.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said it was not
their practice to comment on whether any application for asylum had
been made, but a Savannah resident who is assisting Alexov said the
violinist has been told he will be allowed to remain in this
country.
   Misha Gubenko, an engineer who emigrated to Savannah from the
Soviet Union 10 years ago, said Friday that Alexov had spoken with
INS officials in Baltimore and was told to expect papers allowing
him to stay.
   Alexov will be the guest of Savannah's small but close-knit
Russian community, Gubenko said.
   ``I consider it one family,'' he said.
   Gubenko's son Alex, who served as interpreter for Alexov during
a news conference in Savannah on Thursday, said Alexov had been
``thinking of ways to get out'' for years.
   He said Alexov, 28, hopes his wife and 5-year-old son will be
allowed to join him. ``He's not sure, but he's hoping.''
   Zaytsev, a 19-year-old who plays the balalaika, an instrument
similar to a guitar, disappeared Sept. 22 before a scheduled
performance of the ensemble.
   Alexov and Istomin, a cellist, failed to return from a period of
free time six days later, Ms. Williams said. The rest of the group,
which had spent 10 days at the university performing as part of a
cultural exchange, left for Moscow later that day, she said.
   School officials did not know the whereabouts of any of the men
until Alexov turned up in Savannah, Ms. Williams said.
   INS officials ``just said they're safe and they're not
missing,'' she said.
   Alexov said through the interpreter that he spent two days with
a priest and two days with a new friend in Baltimore before calling
a friend who plays with the Savannah Symphony.
   The friend, who identified himself only as Oleg, said he drove
to Baltimore to get Alexov.
   ``The only thing he had was his violin and the clothes on his
back,'' said Alex Gubenko. The interpreter said it was painful for
Alexov to leave his family, but he does not want to go back to the
Soviet Union.

   A hunter says he was wrong to wait a
day before reporting the discovery of the remains of a woman.
   Wayne T. Grantham, 21, of Rogers was hunting Sept. 16 when he
found the remains of Dana Stidham of Centerton, who disappeared on
July 26. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.
   Grantham said Thursday that he waited not just because he was
late for an afternoon of dove hunting with a friend, but also
because he did not realize the remains were recent.
   ``I knew there were a lot of Civil War relics and Indian relics
in the area, and I thought it might be something like that,'' he
said.
   The bones ``weren't going anywhere,'' he said. ``I'll admit it.
I was wrong.''
   He denied a report by the Benton County sheriff's office that he
had said he waited to report the bones because he didn't want to
disturb the area for hunting. He has not been charged in the case.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The La Brea tar pits, where Ice Age animals like
the dire wolf became trapped and preserved in sticky goo, have been
a gold mine for scientists for a hundred years.
   Now the Los Angeles tar pits have gone on the road in an
exhibit, where people can imagine being entombed in an asphalt
grave.
   The traveling show, on display at the Museum of Science in
Boston, contains dozens of artifacts taken from the California tar
pits. The specimens, which resemble finely carved wooden
sculptures, range from the 10-foot-long skeleton of a ground sloth
to the tiny jaw of a lizard.
   ``There were literally millions of animals stuck in there,''
said Richard Sheffield, senior designer for the exhibit.
   The bones date back as far as 40,000 years, which ``geologically
is just an instant,'' Sheffield said. He noted that dinosaurs
became extinct 65 million years earlier.
   But with all the plant and animal specimens sunk in the tar,
scientists discovered the remains of only one human. By examining
the skull of the ``La Brea Woman,'' researchers estimated she lived
approximately 9,000 years ago.
   Moreover, they speculate she was murdered by a blow to the head.
   ``It's one of those crimes that it will be kind of hard to find
a witness,'' Sheffield said.
   The pits are scattered through a 22-acre park in Southern
California. The tar oozes up through the ground, mixing with sand
and rock to form asphalt in pits that are about 20 feet deep.
   In the winter, the pits get hard, but on hot summer days, the
asphalt mix turns soft and gooey.
   Scientists got their first clues about the tar-covered treasures
back in 1875, when a large canine tooth was presented to William
Denton, a Boston paleontologist.
   He determined that the tooth belonged to a saber-toothed cat,
which would be approximately the size of the modern African lion.
   Many of the pits' remains were of predators that would spot an
easy meal stuck in the tar and become trapped themselves.
   After animals were mired in the tar and died, they became
saturated with asphalt _ created when the tar mixes with sand and
rocks _ and the bones were locked in by cool winter temperatures.
   The result has been a preservation process so complete that the
skull of an American lion still has its 2-inch fangs plus dozens of
smaller teeth.
   If anyone wants to imagine the frustration of getting stuck, the
exhibit has a display case with tar taken from the La Brea site.
Visitors can test their strength by lifting a pair of pistons, and
then imagining it is their feet instead.
   ``Sometimes you would get an animal with one foot stuck, and
then when they're trying to get out they would get their other feet
stuck,'' Sheffield said.
   The exhibit includes stops in New York, Baltimore, Milwaukee and
Fort Worth, Texas, before it returns to California in 1991.

   Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov ended
his first U.S. visit Friday by inviting his counterpart to Moscow,
praising American soldiers and bragging about the impenetrability
of his country's air defense system.
   Yazov and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney appeared at a joint news
conference where they pledged a continuation of military exchanges,
but made no substantive announcements.
   ``It is important to build friendship, develop mutual
understanding,'' said Yazov, who met with President Bush on his
week-long trip.
   Cheney, who said he would visit the Soviet Union at a
yet-to-be-decided time, said the military-to-military contacts
between the two superpower defense chiefs were ``very productive.''
   In an aside, Cheney said later he had been with Yazov on a bus
touring the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa., when he
received the first report by portable telephone Tuesday that a coup
was underway in Panama. The coup against Panamanian ruler Manuel
Antonio Noriega failed within hours.
   During the week, Yazov visited Camp Pendleton, a Marine training
base north of San Diego; Luke Air Force Base in Arizona and Fort
Bragg, home of the Army's 82nd Airborne in Fayetteville, N.C.
   What impressed him most, Yazov said, were the soldiers _
``dedicated young men'' with a ``high level of training.''
   In a question-and-answer session with reporters, Yazov said the
Soviets are not worried about the development of the B-2 bomber,
the radar-evading plane known as Stealth.
   ``We don't have to modify the Soviet air defense system,'' he
said, adding the Soviets ``can bring down any air threat.'' But he
said he hoped the United States would not use the B-2 ``so we would
not be forced to bring them down.''
   On other subjects, he said the Soviet armed forces have not been
increased in size, but obsolete weapons systems have been replaced.
   Asked whether the Soviet Union was concerned about the Strategic
Defense Initiative, Yazov challenged a reporter: ``Are you aware of
what SDI is? Could you explain it to me?''
   He called SDI ``hypothetical,'' and said the Soviet Union
opposed putting weapons in space. ``We don't intend to create any
similiar space-based weapons'' systems, he said.
   U.S. officials also said Cheney and Yazov discussed an incident
of a Soviet warship plying the Mediterranean opening fire on a U.S.
surveillance plane south of Crete Sept. 22.
   Naval officials said the Soviets apologized for the incident and
said the Soviets had no intention of endangering U.S. aircraft. The
incident was first reported in The Los Angeles Times.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Activists Agree To Release Embassy Hostages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leftist activists ended their
28-hour takeover of the Costa Rican Embassy on Friday, releasing
the 12 hostages they held to protest against President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government.
   A total of 12 hostages and 20 members of the Federation of
Committees of Mothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners were
evacuated in six International Red Cross vehicles around 1:30 p.m.,
watched by journalists.
   The reporters were kept 30 yards away by police and not allowed
to talk to the evacuees. None of the activists nor the one Costa
Rican diplomat and 11 Salvadoran embassy employees appeared to be
hurt.
   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval told reporters some of
the activists left weapons ``inside the (embassy) offices or
hidden,'' because they carried none when they boarded the Red Cross
vehicles.
   The activists have insisted they were not armed, but Costa Rican
diplomats disputed that.
   Sandoval said the hostages were being taken to Red Cross
headquarters in San Salvador, where they would be undergo medical
checks before being sent home, and the activists returned to the
federation office.
   He said the Salvadoran government could eventually file charges
against some of those involved in the takeover.
   The federation has been protesting for the past eight years the
kidnapping and killing of suspected leftists by rightist death
squads. The decade-old civil war has killed more than 70,000
people, between death-squad victims and casualties of the fighting.

   Adults are not as impressed with the overall
job of colleges and universities as younger Americans, and most
minorities feel race makes it harder to get a college degree,
according to a Gallup Poll released Friday.
   The national survey, conducted for the Council for Advancement
and Support of Education, found that the majority of adults grade
higher education institutions a high grade _ 38 percent a B and 35
percent a C.
   Only 6 percent think colleges and universities deserve an A,
while 10 percent would give them a D and 3 percent a failing grade
of F. Eleven percent didn't know.
   Young people gave superior grades to higher education
institutions in a Gallup survey last year, with 76 percent of
13-to-21-year-olds rating the overall performance of colleges and
universities an A or B.
   In the current survey, young adults age 18 to 29 were more
likely than middle-aged adults, age 30 to 49, to give the
opportunities colleges offer to succeed an A or a B. Fifty-four
percent of the young people gave colleges A's and B's, compared to
43 percent of older people.
   Young adults also gave higher rates to colleges for producing
quality teachers _ 44 percent an A or B compared to 37 percent by
older respondents.
   ``Clearly, most Americans, especially younger people, consider
higher education to be a very worthwhile investment,'' said Gary
Quehl, president of the council. ``At the same time, we in higher
education need to continually take the pulse of the ultimate
consumers _ the American public _ to ensure we are offering them
the quality programs and services they want and need.
   ``The survey results suggest areas where we need to concentrate
our efforts in the future,'' he said.
   Forty-five percent of those surveyed believed all high school
graduates, regardless of race, have equal access to a college
education, said the poll, based on 1,253 telephone interviews in
July and released as part of National Higher Education Week.
   However, virtually the same number _ 44 percent _ disagreed,
saying a person's race makes it harder for that person to gain
access to a college education. Minorities were significantly more
likely than whites to have that belief about race, 59 percent vs.
42 percent.
   Questioned about ways colleges could increase the access to a
college education for students of all races, six in 10 Americans
suggested working closely with parents, community, and church
groups to encourage minority participation.
   Other survey results were:
   _55 percent said colleges and universities excel in conducting
scientific research, with 17 percent giving an A in this area and
an additional 38 percent rating the system a B. Thirty-one percent
rated it C or below and 14 percent didn't know.
   _49 percent said colleges and universities deserve an A or B for
providing all Americans equal opportunity to succeed; roughly the
same number, 47 percent, gave a C or below; 4 percent didn't know.
   The margin of error for the telephone poll was plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   The council is the nation's largest education association in
terms of institutional membership, with about 2,850 colleges,
universities and independent secondary and elementary schools as
members.

<HEAD>Consumers Resume Borrowing in August</HEAD>

   Americans took out $3.48 billion more in
consumer debt than they retired in August, the government reported
Friday, resuming their borrowing practices as expected after
reducing their debt in July for the first time in 2{ years.
   Analysts had said the July debt liquidation was a one-time
thing, and forecast continued borrowing in the foreseeable future.
   ``We really haven't become a nation of big savers,'' said
economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a Washington
forecasting firm. ``People aren't tearing up their credit cards.''
   The Federal Reserve Board said consumer credit in August
increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 percent,
compared to July's revised decrease of 0.9 percent, which was even
steeper than the 0.5 percent originally reported.
   The decline in July was the first since January 1987, when
consumer debt fell $1.63 billion, or 3.4 percent.
   For all of 1988, consumer credit climbed 8.5 percent.
   The August debt rebound had been expected in part because of
robust automobile sales propelled by end-of-model-year sales
incentives and the threat of steep price increases for 1990 models.
   Auto loans, which fell 6.9 percent in July and 2.3 percent in
June, grew by $400 million in August, or 1.7 percent on an annual
rate. Auto loans had declined $1.67 billion in July.
   The category of debt that includes credit cards rose by $3.57
billion in August, resuming a sharp 22.5 percent annual rate of
increase. It had risen only 8.9 percent to $1.41 billion in July,
down from a 20.1 percent hike in June.
   ``People are shifting now from things like cars and other major
durables to soft goods'' such as clothing, Mrs. Shaber said. ``This
reflects a shift in household spending patterns that has been going
on for the past year.''
   Consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of all economic
activity, is watched closely as a sign of economic health,
particularly in light of Fed efforts to contain inflation by
slowing the economy _ but without driving it into a recession.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's monetary
policy-making body, met earlier this week to determine credit
strategy for the coming weeks. Its decision will not be disclosed
publicly for six weeks.
   Nevertheless, analysts did not expect any major changes in
central bank policies and look for interest rates to continue at
their current level for much of the remainder of the year.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by
$158 million, a 1 percent annual rate of growth. That compared with
a 1.1 percent decline in July.
   Mobile home debts continued to fall, down a whopping $656
million or a 33.3 percent annual rate of decline. This category has
fallen for seven consecutive months including a July drop of $56
million, or 2.8 percent.
   The various changes left total consumer debt in August at a
seasonally adjusted $703.8 billion.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says East Germany Will Change, But Through Communist Leadership</HEAD>

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told East
Germans Friday their country is gripped by the changes shaking
Eastern Europe, but they should calmly follow their Communist
leaders through the turmoil.
   Gorbachev has been unable to push Erich Honecker's conservative
East German leadership on a reform path. But he praised East
Germany's economic and social progress in ceremonies marking the
40th anniversary of the Communist state and staunchly defended its
sovereignty.
   While thousands of East Germans are fleeing to the West the
Soviet leader said East Germany's Communist Party must lead the
country through a difficult period of renewal.
   Gorbachev, viewed by many East Germans as the champion of
change, was greeted warmly by crowds well organized by authorities.
But at one point he was drawn to about 500 teen-agers who arrived
outside official sponsorship and shouted, ``Gorby! Gorby!''
   Speaking to party and government officials at Berlin's Palace of
the Republic, Gorbachev said East Germany has its unique problems
``determined by the need to cross new frontiers, the general
processes of modernization and renewal, which the whole socialist
world has gotten down to.''
   Earlier in the day, with East Berliners crowding around him,
Gorbachev urged them to ``be patient, don't panic, and don't be
sad.'' He told them that the East German party has the ability to
think through problems and change its policies if necessary.
   But in comments to journalists, the Soviet president said no one
could afford to sit still.
   In response to questions, he said of East Germany ``the danger
is for those who don't react to life. Those who grasp the impulse
of society and base their policy on that have no reason to fear.''
   That comment could have been directed at the 77-year-old
Honecker who has resisted Gorbachev's bid for reform in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union.
   But Gorbachev on his two-day stay in East Germany does not want
to say anything to further destabilize this outpost of the East
bloc.
   More than 100,000 East Germans have left their country for the
West this year alone. Their flight through other Eastern European
countries, especially Hungary but also Czechoslovakia and Poland,
has threatened open breaks in the Warsaw Pact alliance.
   Gorbachev has refrained from criticizing Hungary, which removed
its border barriers last month and allowed East German refugees to
cross freely into Austria, and said in his speech that his policy
toward Eastern Europe is based on ``equality, self-reliance and
solidarity.''
   He drew the most applause from the party and government
officials by dismissing calls from the West to remove the Berlin
Wall.
   ``Our Western partners should understand that questions
regarding the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) are not
solved in Moscow but in Berlin,'' he said. He added the post-World
War II structure that created East Germany has helped keep the
peace in Europe for more than 40 years.
   Groups selected by authorities greeted Gorbachev earlier in the
day at a Soviet war memorial and a downtown East Berlin monument to
the victims of fascism and militarism. They also lined the
motorcade routes.
   Gorbachev was attracted to a crowd of teen-agers across the
street from the Treptow Park monument to the Soviet soldiers killed
in the battle for Berlin in 1945.
   The young people, not among those picked by authorities, cheered
Gorbachev and he left his limousine for a minute to step across the
cobblestone street and shake hands.
   Some teen-agers who talked to reporters later praised Gorbachev.
   ``He would make socialism stronger,'' said one. Another youth
lauded Gorbachev for having a more open policy in the state-run
news media.

   Policy-makers at the Federal Reserve decided
to keep interest rates unchanged in late August, following a period
earlier in the summer when they were nudging rates lower, according
to minutes of the meeting released Friday.
   The Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-1 at its Aug. 22
meeting to make no changes in interest rates although it issued a
directive that leaned toward credit-easing if the economy weakened.
   ``For the period ahead, a steady course was desirable in light
of the latest evidence suggesting that price pressures were not
intesifying'' and the economy was continuing to grow at a moderate
pace, the committee said.
   The bellwether federal funds rate _ the interest rate most
closely watched for signals of Fed policy decisions _ fell from
9.75 percent in early June to 9 percent by late July as the central
bank eased its credit grip amid signs of widespread economic
weakness.
   However, since that time, various indicators show that the
economy was not as weak as previously feared and the Fed has made
no further moves to ease credit conditions. The funds rate, the
interest banks charge each other to make overnight loans, has been
unchanged at 9 percent for the past two months.
   The Open Market Committee, composed of Fed governors in
Washington and five of the 12 Fed regional bank presidents, met
again on Wednesday. The minutes of that meeting will not be
released until after the next Open Market Committee meeting on Nov.
14, but private economists said they believed that the central bank
decided again this week to make no moves to change credit policy.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the unemployment rate
rose to 5.3 percent in September as manufacturing employment took
the biggest one-month nosedive since the end of the last recession.
   But Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said he
believed that it would take more signs of weakness than one month's
unemployment report to convince the Fed to loosen credit further.
   Fed policy-makers did leave room for further easing with a
directive that leaned in that direction.
   Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City regional Fed bank,
cast the lone dissenting vote, arguing that in his view inflation
remained at unacceptably high levels and this did not permit any
bias toward easing.

   The kidnapping of two Red Cross workers in
Lebanon on Friday occurred even as the organization was planning
worldwide television concerts in a campaign to benefit war's
civilian victims.
   The campaign is planned to culminate with rock and classical
music concerts and other events May 8, 1991, attempting to persuade
combatants to stop killing civilians, Red Cross officials said.
   Kidnapped in Sidon by masked gunmen were Emmanuel Christen, 32,
and Elio Erriquez, 23, who had been distributing artificial limbs
to victims of Lebanon's civil war.
   ``Today the conflicts don't look like they did'' when the Red
Cross was founded in 1864, ``when there were two or three big
armies clashing on a big field and that was it,'' said Princess
Christina of Sweden.
   The princess, representing a seven-nation steering committee
planning the campaign, spoke in an interview Thursday.
   The organizers are enlisting rock stars and other popular
figures to head drives in many of the 148 countries that have Red
Cross or Red Crescent organizations, said Leon Davico, the
Geneva-based campaign director.
   Princess Christina said the Red Cross will base its campaign on
conventions agreed to by virtually all nations in which they
promised to respect rules regarding prisoners, soldiers and
combatants during wars.
   Davico added, ``We'll tell the armies, `You have the duty to
protect the civilians. If you want to fight, it's your business,
unfortunately, but you haven't got the right to kill defenseless
women and children and old people.'''
   Princess Christina said there were about 30 conflicts in the
world that cause concern, but they usually don't fit the
traditional pattern of one country at war with another.
   ``It's internal conflicts within a country or within a region,''
she said, noting the conflicts sometimes involve political or
religious groups.
   Princess Christina said the planners had yet to set a
fund-raising goal for the project.
   Davico said there would be a series of concerts, in a worldwide
television event, with a rock concert reminiscent of the Band Aid
gala to raise money for famine relief in Africa.
   But he said there would be other events such as a classical
concert from the United States or a brief program from the Bolshoi
ballet in Moscow or something form Tokyo.
   Interspersed in the entertainment, he said, would be 10 short
films, each lasting 5-7 minutes, about war victims. The films will
be produced by top film makers from different countries.

<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion lawyers told a panel of federal
judges Friday that the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in July
to reinstate Louisiana laws that would send doctors to jail for
performing abortions.
   The argument launched a court challenge by Louisiana officials
seeking to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.
   Rachael Pine, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer,
countered that there is nothing in the July ruling that justifies
the revival of three strong anti-abortion statutes struck down in
1976.
   ``It is as simple today as it was 13 years ago,'' Pine told the
three-judge U.S. District Court panel.
   Nearly 100 abortion rights supporters jammed the courtroom,
sitting quietly as Pine and other ACLU lawyers argued with
representatives of Louisiana Attorney General William Guste and New
Orleans District Attorney Harry Connick, both of whom want to lift
a 1976 injunction banning enforcement of the abortion statutes.
   Both Connick and Guste, neither of whom attended Friday's
hearing, have said their effort is a test case to get a Supreme
Court ruling on whether Louisiana can indeed ban abortion.
   The July ruling made state laws the main arena for the battle
over abortion. Pennsylvania and Michigan are considered likely to
enact new legislation, and lawmakers in Illinois, Michigan and
Florida are expected to take up the issue at special sessions.
   Florida's Supreme Court gave abortion rights backers a victory
Thursday by striking down a parental consent law on the ground that
it violated Florida's constitutional privacy rights. The attorney
general's office in Tallahassee said the state would file a
petition for a rehearing next week.
   Some people on both sides of the issue said the Florida decision
is so broad that women in the state would have their current rights
to an abortion, even if the U.S. Supreme Court reverses Roe vs.
Wade.
   If the Louisiana law were enforced, doctors who perform
abortions would face 10-year jail terms. People who advertise
abortion services or sell drugs or devices to induce abortions also
would be subject to jail terms and fines.
   The laws even ban sale of contraceptives, although Guste said no
attempt would be made to enforce that provision.
   Critics say the laws make no exceptions for rape or incest, but
Guste said abortions in such cases could be considered therapeutic
and, therefore, legal.
   Pine argued there is no basis for lifting the injunction.
   John Baker, an attorney for Connick and a law professor at
Louisiana State University, said July's Supreme Court decision in a
Missouri case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, changed
the standard by which courts can review abortion laws.
   A state now may ban abortions if it proves it has a compelling
interest in protecting the rights of the unborn, he argued.
   In Louisiana, such an interest is already established in laws
giving fetuses the right to collect support payments, win wrongful
death suits or inherit property if they are born alive, said Baker
and Jennifer Schaye, a lawyer for Guste.
   ``Tort law and inheritance law is not constitutional law,'' Pine
said later during a news conference.
   She also disputed Baker's contention that the Webster opinion
changed the standard of judicial review. She quoted Chief Justice
William Rehnquist's opinion in which he stated specifically that
Webster leaves ``undisturbed'' the 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling.
   Baker said the Webster ruling changed Roe's standard of fetal
viability _ the point at which the fetus could survive outside the
womb _ from 24 weeks to 20 weeks.
   Pine said the Missouri requirement that doctors test for fetal
viability at 20 weeks was upheld in Webster because there is a
four-week margin for error in determining length of gestation.
   Judges William Eugene Davis, Martin L.C. Feldman and A.J.
MacNamara gave no indication when or how they would rule in the
case.
   Before and after the hearing, abortion rights demonstrators
gathered on the steps of the federal courthouse, chanting and
singing and carrying banners in support of a woman's right to
abortion.
   They greatly outnumbered a band of about a dozen anti-abortion
pickets, most of whom marched quietly in a circle in front of the
courthouse steps while one read Bible verses aloud.
   No violent confrontations or arrests were reported.

<HEAD>Audit Finds Federal Mismanagement of Indian Trust Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An audit has uncovered widespread Interior
Department mismanagement of an Indian trust fund, including the
unexplained disapperance of $17 million and other losses because of
sloppy record-keeping, officials said Friday.
   The losses were brought to light by an inspector general's
investigation into the Bureau of Indian Affairs' management of the
trust fund totaling more than $1.7 billion.
   The fund, which represents money belonging to 200 Indian tribes
and 290,000 individuals, is managed for investment purposes by the
bureau. Most of the money comes from court-ordered monetary awards
to the Indians or revenue from oil, gas or mineral leases.
   The inspector general's report concluded that the financial and
investment records of the trust fund were in such disarray that
their accuracy no longer can be relied upon. It called the fund's
management and control problems pervasive.
   The investigators said they found no evidence indicating how $17
million shown on the fund's main ledger had been disposed of. While
there is no direct evidence that the money had been stolen, the
report said it did not rule out the possibility.
   The audit identified another $19.5 million in actual or
potential losses because of poor investment decisions or
mismanagement of invested funds. In many cases, sloppy
record-keeping and inattention cost the fund millions of dollars,
the report said.
   The Bureau of Indian Affairs acknowleged severe shortcomings in
the record-keeping of the trust fund. It said that much of the
problem stemmed from not having a modern automated system. The
agency said it is preparing to shift the accounting
responsibilities for the fund to a private contractor, possibly
later this month.
   The report said that for the most part the losses and
shortcomings were kept from the Indian tribes or individual to whom
the money belonged.
   ``The Bureau's practice regarding known losses of trust funds
has been to not disclose the losses, but rather wait for (an Indian
tribe or individual) ... to file a claim or sue the government for
recovery,'' James Richards, the inspector general, wrote Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan.
   In an interview, Richards said for the most part the tribes
never filed such a claim because they were not aware of the losses.
``They (the fund managers) didn't tell anybody,'' said Richards.
   While investigators had no clue as to the missing $17 million,
they documented millions of dollars in losses because of poor
management and record keeping.
   For example:
   _At least $5 million remains unaccounted for in connection with
the fund's investments in guaranteed mortgages. Control of some of
the mortgage holdings were transfered to a private fiscal agent in
1983, but investigators found no records that showed how many loans
were shifted or when they were to be paid off, raising the
possiblity that some funds may have been lost.
   An attempt by investigators to determine the status of 17 loans
worth $3.5 million was unsuccessful because of the incomplete
records, said the report. ``We believe these funds may have been
lost or misappropriated.''
   _From mid-1985 to the end of 1986, fund managers under-reported
the amount of uninvested money in the fund, resulting in the loss
$2.4 million during the 18 months in overnight interest payments
from the U.S. Treasury.
   _In 1984, fund managers deposited $7.8 million in a Kansas City
bank to buy certificates of deposits supposedly from a credit
union. But no CDs were ever received, nor interest paid because the
money was fraudulently diverted by a middleman.
   The bureau eventually recovered most of the money, but as of
last April $1.5 million was still lost as was an estimated $1.2
million in interest that the money could have earned. The losses
were never recorded on the trust fund's ledgers, or officially
recognized, the report said.
   _The fund has lost nearly $4 million in recent years from bank
failures. While such losses normally are recovered in about 60
days, it has taken five years for the Bureau to recover some $3.1
million as a result of bank failures. The delay has cost the fund
an estimated $3.8 million in interest alone, said the report.

<HEAD>Pulaski Shutting Down For Aryan Nations March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PULASKI, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business and community leaders in this
southern Tennessee community are taking a simple approach to
Saturday's scheduled march by white supremacists: They plan to shut
the town down.
   ``I'm hoping it's pouring down rain. That'd put a damper on
them,'' Mayor Hal Stewart said Friday. The group has a
constitutional right to march, he said, but town residents aren't
happy about the gathering.
   ``I doubt there'll be over five places open in Pulaski, and
they'll probably be on the outlying sections of the city,'' Stewart
said.
   ``We're just going to shut the town down and let them have their
march. There won't be anything open around the square. All the
merchants downtown agreed to close.''
   The Aryan Nations, a white supremacist group based in Hayden
Lake, Idaho, plans the early afternoon march to commemorate the
Oct. 6 birthday of Civil War hero Sam Davis.
   Davis, a Confederate scout, was hanged in Pulaski after refusing
to tell Union leaders who revealed information about movements of
Northern troops.
   Pulaski, population 7,600, also has a footnote in history as the
1865 birthplace of the original Ku Klux Klan. The current Klan,
which traces its roots to 1915 Georgia, also has marched here.
   No one knows how many marchers to expect Saturday in this town
90 miles south of Nashville, but the Tennessee Highway Patrol will
help police from Pulaski and surrounding towns with security.
   ``All we've got to go on is what their leader says, and he says
they're going to bring in a thousand,'' the mayor said of the
group's chief, the Rev. Richard G. Butler. ``We don't have any
proof there'll be that many.''
   City officials are counting on Police Chief Stanley Newton's
experience with the Klan.
   ``He's had three years of experience with three other marches by
the Klan, so we feel he and his officers are well-seasoned,'' said
Alderman Dan Speer.
   Pulaski residents were quietly indignant about the Klan marches,
which began in 1986 to protest designation of Martin Luther King's
birthday as a national holiday. But this time they decided to take
a stronger stand.
   A group called Giles Countians United, after trying to
discourage the march with petitions and resolutions, is urging
Giles County residents to stay away from the downtown area to avoid
possible confrontations with the marchers.
   ``Our whole goal is to at least tell the rest of the world that
Pulaski does not share the views of that group,'' said organizer
Mike Curry, president of Pulaski's First National Bank.
   Many residents have made a point of leaving town Saturday, and
two high school football games were moved up to Thursday night to
avoid incoming Aryan Nations members.
   More than 130 businesses agreed to close their doors Saturday,
no small decision, according to Speer, an insurance agent and
former restaurant owner.
   ``This is going to be the first Saturday of the month, which
traditionally is the most profitable Saturday and the busiest of
the month,'' Speer said. ``This is going to cost each business
several thousand dollars. The sacrifice the owners and employees
are making needs to be recognized.''

   Fires that strike nursing homes are especially
dangerous because the elderly are a high risk group for fire
deaths, a spokeswoman for a national fire safety group said Friday.
   In fact, Americans over the age of 65 accounted for nearly
one-fourth of the fire fatalities in the ountry during a recent
four-year period, said Julie Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the
National Fire Prevention Association.
   ``They have the highest fire fatality rates involving smoking
materials, heating and cooking equipment and electrical fires,''
Reynolds said in a telephone interview.
   Careless smoking was blamed for the fire that killed nine people
and injured nearly 100 others when it struck a 172-bed nursing home
in Norfolk, Va., Thursday night. The nine residents who died ranged
in age from 65 to 97.
   An association study from 1982-1986 showed the elderly have a
fire death rate of 57.8 per 1 million population, about three times
the national average of 19.6 per million, Reynolds said.
   During the same period, the study showed that Americans over 65
accounted for 24.1 percent of the nation's fire deaths.
   ``There are certainly some factors that contribute to the higher
fire fatality rates,'' Reynolds said, noting some senior citizens
may be confined to living situations like nursing homes where they
may be bedridden or have physical problems which make their rescue
or escape difficult.
   For both private homes and nursing homes, the group recommends
smoke detectors in each sleeping room. Institutions should also
place smoke detectors in corridors and common spaces, the group
recommends.
   In addition, the fire association said portable fire
extinguishers should be provided near hazardous areas. It also
recommends automatic sprinkler systems for new high rise buildings.
   Fire officials said the Norfolk nursing home did not have any
sprinklers, but added they were not required when the home was
built in 1969.
   Reynolds noted the Virginia nursing home tragedy came right
before the group's National Fire Prevention Week, which is Oct.
8-14.

<HEAD>State Says East Germans Seized Outside US Embassy Can Leave For West</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several East Germans detained by police
outside the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin will be permitted to leave
the country, the State Department said Friday.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the assurances were given by the
East German government and that he did not know how many people
were involved.
   All of those detained were released from custody with the
exception of two who were arrested for reasons unrelated to
emigration, Boucher said.
   In a related development, the State Department press office said
it had erroneously distributed a notice to reporters that East
Germans hoping to flee to the West were ``politely denied entry''
to the U.S. Embassy.
   A statement issued in its place said the embassy staff asks
those who seek to enter the chancery what their purpose is in
entering the building.
   ``Those who have normal embassy business are allowed to enter,''
the statement said. ``No embassy employees force people off the
premises.''
   The initial press notice, which was issued Thursday night,
reinforced earlier U.S. statements that the embassy was not
equipped to grant waves of would-be emigrants extended sanctuary.
   ``Our embassy is not in a position to accommodate large numbers
of people who want to sit there until other governments do
something,'' Boucher said Thursday.
   Eighteen East Germans _ 10 adults and eight children _
voluntarily left the U.S. Embassy Wednesday evening after a 31-hour
occupation that touched off an effort by dozens of others to try to
get past East German police and into the building.
   Boucher said the East German government had given assurances
that ``their desire to emigrate would be considered positively and
that no reprisals would be taken against them.'' Also, he said, a
woman pushed away by police from the entrance was given similar
assurances.
   ``We try to do what we can to express our humanitarian concerns
for individuals as well as whole groups of people,'' the U.S.
spokesman said.
   But while asserting again American support for the right to
travel, Boucher said it was ``worth remembering'' that the vast
majority of East Germans trying to emigrate wish to settle in West
Germany, and not the United States.
   ``The embassy that we have in Berlin is, of course, not set up
as a place where people can go,'' Boucher said. ``We do not have
the capability to handle even a limited number of people.''
   The U.S. official also cautioned the would-be East German
emigrants that ``people potentially put themselves in a difficult
situation with respect to their own government.''
   Boucher said the advice was based on recent statements by the
East German government that flocking to Western embassies ``was no
longer acceptable.''
   The notice to the press Thursday night said visitors to the
embassy were asked by U.S. officials why they wanted to enter the
building.
   ``Those who have normal embassy business are allowed to enter,''
it said. ``Those who do not are informed that the U.S. is unable to
assist them on other types of matters. They are politely denied
entry. No one is forced from embassy premises.''
   When hundreds of East Germans tried to rush the five-story stone
building in downtown East Berlin on Wednesday, the doors were
slammed shut and East German police called in reinforcements. About
100 formed a line in front of the embassy.
   Boucher said the fact that thousands of East Germans are trying
to flee ``reflects a deep sense of dissatisfaction'' with their
government.
   He said the police were not requested by U.S. Embassy officials.
``We deplore the manhandling of the crowd,'' the spokesman said.
``And the embassy has protested the stopping of people trying to
visit it.''

<HEAD>Report Says Stockton Schoolyard Killer Hated Asians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``psychological autopsy'' released
Friday on the Stockton schoolyard killer found he was a solitary
racist who took out his hatred on Southeast Asian children because
they were visible targets.
   Patrick Purdy, who committed suicide after gunning down five
children at an elementary school, blamed minorities for his
shortcomings, said the report released by Attorney General John Van
de Kamp.
   ``His crime was not the result of sudden impulse. It was
premeditated murder,'' Van de Kamp said.
   The attorney general said that although Purdy acted on racial
motives in his Jan. 17 attack, he was not connected with any racist
group.
   ``Purdy was filled with hate and anger toward many groups,'' Van
de Kamp said, and in his final days that hatred ``focused on
Stockton's very visible Southeast Asian community.''
   The report deals with why someone who had extensive contact with
the mental health and criminal justice systems wasn't prevented
from going on a rampage with an assault rifle.
   By the time he had reached his late teens, Purdy had received
treatment for alcoholism, worked as a prostitute and sought
voluntary treatment at mental health centers, but rarely returned
for voluntary follow-up treatments, according to the report.
   ``The tale of Patrick Purdy's life ... is a sad and depressing
account of a failed family, of a child without resources who failed
to cope with severe stress and lack of affection, and of a human
who ended his short life with virtually no ties to the community
and society surrounding him,'' said the report.
   The report revealed that two weeks before the shootings, Purdy
entered a Stockton bar wearing camouflage clothing. He told the
bartender that he had an AK-47 rifle and talked about the weapon's
capabilities.
   ``He complained about the Vietnamese receiving compensation from
the government, saying as he left the bar: `You're going to read
about me in the papers.'''
   The report said Purdy was filled with anger and hate toward
virtually all identifiable ethnic minorities.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill to Impose Sanctions on Countries Using Chemical
Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee
approved legislation Friday that would require U.S. sanctions
against countries that violate the ban on using chemical and
biological weapons.
   The legislation, approved on a voice vote, also would encourage
international sanctions against violating countries.
   In addition, it requires the president to monitor efforts by
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria and other developing nations to develop or
acquire chemical and biological weapons.
   The approval comes on the heels of a proposal made by President
Bush before the United Nations to cut U.S. and Soviet stockpiles of
such weapons by 80 percent. The Soviets countered with a proposal
for total elimination.
   U.S. sanctions include a cutoff of arms sales, an embargo on
imports from the violating country, an end to credit guarantees
from the Export-Import Bank, a halt to financial assistance from
U.S. banks and an end to military and economic assistance.
   The United States would also encourage a denial of assistance
from international lending institutions as well as other sanctions.
   The bill says that as many as 20 countries are capable of
producing chemical weapons and that by the year 2000, at least 15
developing countries will have the ability to produce ballistic
missiles capable of delivering the weapons.

   The Soviet Union has invited Vice Prime
Minister Shimon Peres for a visit, officials said Friday. He would
be the first Israeli Cabinet minister to travel there since Moscow
broke relations over the 1967 Middle East War.
   The invitation to Peres, head of the Labor Party, was offered by
the non-governmental Soviet Peace Committee during Peres' meeting
in New York last month with a five-member Soviet trade delegation,
officials said.
   No date has been set, said spokesman Elie Yosef of the Finance
Ministry, which Peres also heads.
   Arye Levin, the head of Israel's consular mission in Moscow,
said the visit could include ``very senior-level contacts.''
Israeli newpapers said Peres might meet with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   The trip would be another step in renewing ties between the two
countries, a process that started with the exchange of consular
delegations in 1986 and 1987. Moscow and most of the Soviet bloc
had broken relations after Israel captured land from Arab countries
in the 1967 war.
   Levin noted in an Israel army radio interview that Peres was
invited ``not as an Israeli minister but as a public figure, head
of the Labor party. It's an invitation from an official body but
not in the name of the Soviet government.''
   ``We should not see such visits as foretelling an immediate
renewal of ties,'' he said. ``The issue is to create a contact .. .
in order to tighten relations between leaders of the two
countries.''
   The Soviets have said the renewal of diplomatic ties with Israel
depends on progress on Middle East peace. The Soviet Union supports
a U.N.-sponsored international peace conference and talks between
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organizaion.
   Some Israelis view the invitation to Peres as encouragement to
the left-center Labor Party, which has not opposed the plan for an
international peace conference. Prime Minister Yitzak Shamir, head
of the right-wing Likud bloc, is against such a conference and any
contact with the PLO.

   President Bush vigorously defended his
handling of the failed coup in Panama on Friday, saying there was
no opportunity to seize Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and use of U.S.
force ``wasn't warranted under the existing circumstances.''
   ``I'm not being stubborn but as I look at all the information I
wouldn't have made a different decision then,'' Bush said.
   He added that he wouldn't rule out any option, including
military intervention, in any future coup attempt.
   Amid a torrent of complaints and questions over the U.S. action,
the White House and Pentagon marched in step, saying the United
States had responded correctly when rebels attempted _ and failed _
to depose Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking charges in Florida.
   Bush offered his defense during a closed-door meeting with
Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill and then publicly after
undergoing surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center for removal
of a finger cyst.
   Similarly, top military leaders _ Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _
testified in closed session before the Senate Intelligence and
Armed Services Committees.
   The two panels were preparing an analysis of issues that remain
in dispute surrounding the events in Panama and contacts between
the rebel officers who organized the coup and U.S. officials.
   Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said a lack of clear
policy guidance from Bush had greatly contributed to U.S. confusion
in dealing with the coup attempt and that there should have been
specific arrangements for how U.S. troops were to react.
   ``We have had a definite, longstanding policy in this country of
encouraging a coup'' in Panama, Nunn told reporters. ``We should
anticipate that our policy ... might succeed. Then we have to know
what we're going to do next.''
   Privately, a senior administration official said that with the
benefit of hindsight, the United States should have done some
things differently and had ``learned some things we need to
improve.''
   Bush, however, said, ``We reviewed all the information and I
don't see anything now that would have made me make a different
decision then.''
   Many members of Congress have complained that Bush erred by not
using the 12,000 U.S. military forces in Panama to assist in
Tuesday's attempted coup. And the president said he knew that some
people wanted him ``to unleash the full military to go in and get
Noriega.''
   Bush said the decision not to use force was made because ``It
wasn't warranted under the existing circumstances. The
commander-in-chief must have the lives of American citizens
foremost in mind when making such a decision.''
   The president said he still wants to see Noriega removed from
power but ``there was never a chance to have him handed over to
us.'' Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., has said he had information that
the rebels wanted to give Noriega to the United States.
   Recounting Bush's remarks on Capitol Hill, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``He just said he had felt we made
the right decisions when he reviewed the information involved, that
he had as good information as could be expected and that he was
confident he did the right thing.
   ``He said we were willing to use force but not ... unless we
know the circumstances and have better information.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., quoted Cheney and Powell as saying they
``basically ... would not have changed their decision and
recommendations to the president, based on what they know today.''
   While insisting that all of the administration's statements
about the coup had been correct, Fitzwater withdrew an earlier one
that the United States had not been in direct contact in advance
with any coup leaders.
   He confirmed that U.S. representatives had been in touch before
Tuesday with the coup leader, Maj. Moises Giroldi, who is believed
to have been killed, perhaps by Noriega. Earlier, Fitzwater had
said that advance word had come through a third-party contact.
   Fitzwater emphatically denied a report in The Wall Street
Journal that Giroldi's wife had tried to alert U.S. officials about
the coup three weeks ago. Similarly, Cheney said he had not heard
that kind of information.
   Nevertheless, Cheney said, ``There are coup reports on a fairly
regular basis. That is not new.''
   Fitzwater, during a briefing with reporters, offered
clarifications on several points:
   _ The rebel forces asked, and the United States agreed, for
American forces to block access routes to Noriega's headquarters.
Even so, Fitzwater said, ``We don't consider that participation in
the coup. We were not involved in the planning, in the operation,
in the carrying it out.''
   _ A cable transmitted to Washington by U.S. military officials
in Panama incorrectly stated that the rebels wanted the United
States to take custody of Noriega. Fitzwater said the cable should
have said the rebels ``won't'' let the U.S. have custody.
   Fitzwater said the erroneous cable never reached Bush. ``There
was never a piece of information in this White House that said
anything other than they were not willing to give him up, period.''
   Sen. Helms has repeatedly said he had information that the
rebels wanted to turn Noriega over to the United States. Fitzwater
said Helms' staff was interviewed by White House chief of staff
John Sununu and could not back up their claims.
   _ Despite earlier suspicions, the United States now believes
Giroldi was actually trying to overthrow Noriega. Earlier, Cheney
had said U.S. officials feared ``a setup'' because Giroldi had been
a Noriega confidant and had helped repel a coup attempt last year.
   Fitzwater said that doubts about Giroldi ``were major factors
that led to a concern that maybe the whole thing was a setup.''
   Disputing The Wall Street Journal on another point, Fitzwater
denied that the rebels had ever asked the United States to deploy a
helicopter to take Noriega into custody.

<HEAD>Salvadoran Leftists End Embassy Seizure, Free Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran activists freed 12
hostages Friday and left the Costa Rican Embassy after a 28-hour
occupation to protest alleged human rights abuses by President
Alfredo Cristiani's government.
   The hostages and 20 members of the Federation of Committees of
Mothers and Relatives of Political Prisoners were taken away in six
International Red Cross vehicles at about 1:30 p.m.
   Journalists watched, but police kept them 30 yards away and
would not let reporters talk to evacuees. None of the hostages, one
Costa Rican diplomat 11 Salvadorans employed in the embassy,
appeared to be harmed.
   Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval told reporters the
hostages were taken to Red Cross headquarters in San Salvador for
medical checks before being sent home, and that the activists
returned to their organization's office.
   He said charges eventually might be filed against some of those
involved.
   The government spokesman said some activists who had been armed
apparently left their weapons ``inside the offices or hidden,''
because they boarded the Red Cross vehicles unarmed.
   Those occupying the embassy had insisted they were not armed,
but Costa Rican diplomats said they carried weapons.
   The Swiss and the Peruvian embassies, which share the six-story
Central America Building with the Costa Rican mission, were not
affected by the occupation. The Costa Rican Embassy is on the third
floor of the building on San Salvador's west side.
   The activists arrived in small groups Thursday morning,
pretending to be applying for visas, then seized the embassy and
took 16 hostages. They later allowed Ambassador Jesus Fernandez,
who had heart trouble, and some employees to leave along with
visitors who were there on business.
   Sandoval called the embassy takeover ``an affront to the
government and people of Costa Rica ... a violent action that makes
no sense.'' He accused the activists of having ``direct links'' to
leftist guerrillas who have fought Salvadoran governments for 10
years.
   A spokeswoman for the activists, who did not give her name, told
reporters earlier the purpose was to protest alleged human rights
violations by Cristiani's rightist government, which assumed power
June 1, and bring pressure for ``concrete measures'' to end the war.
   For eight years, the federation has protested kidnappings and
killings by rightist death squads of people suspected of leftist
sympathies. More than 70,000 people have died in the war and
related political violence, most of them civilians.

<HEAD>Day After Conviction, Bakker Heads For Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker headed home to
Florida on Friday to prepare for an appeal of his fraud and
conspiracy conviction and the possibility he might be jailed later
this month, his lawyer said.
   ``We got a lynch verdict,'' defense lawyer George T. Davis said
Friday. ``One of the happy things about this is that we weren't
strung up. We're alive and kicking and raring to go.''
   Davis said the Bakkers plan to suspend their storefront ministry
in Orlando for the time being to concentrate on the televangelist's
appeal. Bakker is free on $250,000 bond pending his sentencing Oct.
24.
   ``We're under some tight time restraints,'' he said. ``We have
to anticipate the judge might refuse bail on appeal.''
   On Thursday, a federal jury found Bakker guilty of all 24 counts
of wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy for bilking his followers
of $3.7 million. He faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison
and fines of more than $5 million.
   ``They're doing well,'' said Davis, who shared farewells
Thursday night with Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, before
returning to his home in Hawaii. ``I think Jim has an inner peace.
   ``They're in the same mood I'm in _ for some strange reason we
don't feel down.''
   Following the verdict, jury foreman Ricky Hill criticized the
performance of Bakker's defense team. ``We kept looking for
something from the defense and we never saw it,'' he said.
   After leaving PTL in March 1987, the couple began the Jim and
Tammy Ministries, which runs a church in Orlando, and conducts a
five-day-a-week evangelistic television show seen on eight cable
outlets.
   During Friday's television show, a stand-in for the Bakkers
urged the faithful to pray, but didn't specifically mention the
verdict.
   An aide in Orlando said Bakker would address his followers on
Sunday.
   ``It will be a regular church service,'' said Don Baldwin,
acting general manager of Jim and Tammy Ministries. ``Jim will be
there. I don't know exactly what all the plans are for it.''
   The Bakkers left Charlotte by car on Friday. They emerged from
co-counsel Harold Bender's office about 12:30 p.m., and Bakker
grabbed some pillows as he joined his son, Jamie Charles, in the
back seat of a Ford Taurus sedan.
   Mrs. Bakker slipped into the front passenger seat next to
Bakker's sister, Donna Puckett, who was driving.
   Davis said a key to the appeal will be the lack of any obvious
signs of fraud in the government evidence.
   ``There are no badges of fraud in this case _ no hidden bank
accounts or false entries in false books,'' Davis said. ``One of
the key things on appeal is the fact that he actually received less
than 1 percent of all the money he raised. He raised about $450
million for PTL.''
   Bakker raised $158 million by selling lodging guarantees, called
``lifetime partnerships,'' at his Heritage USA retreat near Fort
Mill, S.C. The indictment said he oversold the partnerships after
he knew there weren't facilities for the people who bought them.
   Justice Department special prosecutor Deborah Smith said in a
television interview Friday that the conviction wasn't a reason to
celebrate.
   ``I think it's very sad for his family, very sad for him,'' she
said. But she added that it was saddest for the thousands of people
who sent money, ``many of them their life savings.''
   Bakker maintained his innocence after his conviction Thursday.
   ``I went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying I was
innocent of the charges against me,'' a smiling Bakker said. ``I
come out still innocent of the charges against me. I put my faith
in God.''

<HEAD>EPA Issues Largest-Ever Toxic Waste Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency ordered a
$6.2 million fine Friday against a California company for allegedly
storing more toxic wastes than it was authorized to handle.
   The civil penalty, the largest fine ever under federal toxic
waste disposal laws, was levied against Casmalia Resources of
Casmalia, Calif., operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage
and disposal facility.
   The EPA accused Casmalia Resources of ``accepting more hazardous
waste materials than its existing landfills were authorized to
handle.''
   The company also was charged with violating federal toxic waste
regulations because it improperly expanded its existing landfills
to accommodate additional wastes.
   EPA spokeswoman Robin Woods said the company must pay the fine
within 30 days or appeal.
   The penalty was based on an estimate on how much additional
profits were earned because the company received the unauthorized
waste shipments. Ms. Woods said the penalty amount could be changed
as more information on the amount of profit becomes available to
the agency.
   Prior to Friday's action, the largest penalty obtained by the
EPA for violation of the federal law governing toxic waste disposal
was $2.78 million last March against the Four County Landfill in
Rochester, Ind. That penalty came as a result of a federal judge's
ruling in a civil suit.
   The fines were issued under the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act, which established disposal and storage requirements
for hazardous wastes.
   Meanwhile, the EPA announced Friday it was establishing a new
policy in the way it selects contractors for the so-called
Superfund program to avoid a potential conflict of interest that
has been the subject of controversy.
   The Superfund program deals with the cleanup of nearly 1,200 of
the most dangerous hazardous waste sites in the country. Critics
have charged that too often contractors who deal with actual
cleanup activities also work for the EPA on policy matters that
determine how cleanup activities are to be conducted.
   In some cases, critics have charged, a single contracting
company may be in a position to virtually create a job for itself.
   The EPA said the new policy would prohibit contractors actually
involved in cleaning up toxic waste sites or with providing
technical assistance in enforcement actions from competing for
contracts that deal with Superfund policy and regulatory issues.

   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus
Friday accused Sen. Orrin Hatch of violating ``constitutional and
civil rights'' in his complaint to the Justice Department about
activities of the lobbying group TransAfrica.
   But Hatch, R-Utah, immediately backed down from his complaint
and disassociated himself from it.
   His press secretary, Paul Smith, quoted Hatch as saying, ``I
called the attorney general and asked him to ignore the letter. It
was overzealousness on the part of my office.''
   Hatch had written Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Monday
asking that he investigate the efforts of TransAfrica and its
president, Randall Robinson, in support of Angolan President
Eduardo dos Santos and his Soviet-backed government.
   Hatch charged in the letter that Robinson was receiving
financing from the Angolan and Cuban governments and was working to
change U.S. policy ``in direct coordination with the Marxist regime
in Angola.''
   ``It appears that these activities may be a direct violation of
the Foreign Agent Registration Act,'' Hatch wrote, referring to the
federal law requiring agents of foreign nations in the United
States to register with the government.
   ``I would like to request that you personally look into this
matter,'' Hatch wrote. ``Mr. Robinson is actively working against
the foreign policy interest of the United States, and I believe
this is a matter that deserves the attention of the Department of
Justice.''
   A spokesman for Thornburgh, Dan Eramian, said the department has
received Hatch's letter. ``It's under review,'' he said.
   Robinson denied Hatch's claims that the Angolan and Cuban
governments finance his group and that a trip last week by
TransAfrica officials to the Angolan capital of Luanda was paid for
by Angola.
   In an interview, he called Hatch's letter ``an outrage'' and
``an attempt to intimidate me.'' He said, ``Joseph McCarthy is
alive and well in Utah.''
   The Black Caucus prepared a letter Friday voicing ``profound
concern'' to Thornburgh over Hatch's request. The letter was signed
by Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the group. Signatures of
other black members of Congress were being collected before the
letter was sent.
   In the letter, the congressmen refer to Hatch's letter as an
attempt ``to curb and restrict the constitutional rights'' of
TransAfrica.
   ``We wish to place on the record our serious concerns regarding
the violation of constitutional and civil rights reflected in
Senator Hatch's letter to you,'' they wrote.
   TransAfrica is a lobbying group concerned with U.S. policy
toward Africa and the Caribbean, and was a leader in pushing for
tougher U.S. sanctions against South Africa. It has worked to alter
official U.S. opposition to the Angolan government and opposes the
U.S. support for Jonas Savimbi, chief of the Angolan rebel group
UNITA.
   Savimbi met with President Bush on Thursday.
   UNITA is one of the largest recipients of covert U.S. military
aid, estimated by some observers at more than $40 million annually.
Transafrica estimates the aid at twice that amount.
   Continuing support for Savimbi has become a focus of some U.S.
conservatives, including Hatch.
   Robinson said the only money the group has received from Angola
and Cuba were the purchases of tickets to the group's annual
fundraising dinner, at $2,000 per table. He said representatives of
50 countries bought tickets, but the group otherwise accepts no
money from foreign governments.

   A mother charged with pushing two of her
children from a window of their 10th-floor apartment pleaded
innocent Friday to murdering one child and attempting to murder the
other.
   A court-appointed lawyer for Ameenah Abdus-Salaam, 32, entered
the plea during an arraignment at Queens Criminal Court Friday
afternoon, said Dick Piperno, a spokesman for the Queens District
Attorney.
   Criminal Court Judge William Ehrlbaum granted her lawyer's
request that Mrs. Abdus-Salaam not appear.
   She is charged with murder, attempted murder, first- and
second-degree assault, reckless endangerment and endangering the
welfare of a child.
   The judge ordered her remanded to a city hospital prison for
psychiatric examination.
   Her 6-year-old daughter Zainab was killed and her 3-year-old son
Husein was critically injured Thursday when Mrs. Abdus-Salaam
pushed them from the window, saying ``God is waiting for you,''
officials said.
   Husein remained in very critical condition on a respirator at
North Shore University Hospital on Long Island Friday, said Carol
Hauptman, a spokeswoman for the hospital.
   The toddler suffered massive internal injuries, fractures and
cardiac arrest as a result of his plunge, said Charles De Gaetano
of the Emergency Medical Service.
   Three other siblings were not hurt, including a 1-year-old girl
saved by rescuers who stormed the apartment in time to stop her
being pushed through the window's child-safety bars, officials said.
   Those three children, 1-year-old Amna, her 8-year-old brother
Askia and 4-year-old sister Fatima, remained hospitalized while
social service officials decided which relative to release them to,
according to a hospital spokeswoman.
   Neighbors said the mother had been distraught over the recent
breakup of her marriage.

   The Bush administration, on the eve of a march
which looms as the largest housing protest since Ronald Reagan
stiffened the government's helping hand, promised Friday ``to win
this war against poverty, homelessness and despair.''
   After meeting with march organizers for nearly three hours at
his office, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp signed a letter of
understanding commiting the administration to several early steps
designed to ease the dilemma of the homeless.
   Among those steps:
   _Next year, at least 10 percent of the single-family homes in
the Housing and Urban Development Department's inventory will be
made available for occupancy by the homeless. HUD now has about
50,000 such homes, mostly from foreclosures, meaning that about
5,000 would be assigned for use by those without shelter. Estimates
of the nation's homeless range from 250,000 to 4 million.
   _The administration will propose changes in the $2.8 billion
worth of community development block grants given to local
governments each year ``so that they will be used to fight poverty,
increase self-sufficiency and opportunity in low-income
communities.''
   _A vow to ``turn the abandoned homes throughout our cities and
towns into decent, affordable homes for the homeless and low-income
people.'' Kemp pledged ``to work directly and aggaressively with
state and local governments to make this happen.''
   The secretary presented his letter to Barry Zigas, president of
the National Low-Income Housing Coalition and a principal organizer
of the three-day protest which already has bent and blistered the
ears of Congress. Zigas was accompanied by a half-dozen homeless
people who shared their personal experiences with Kemp.
   ``I pledge to work directly with individuals and groups
throughout the country to assure that HUD's programs, properties
and funds are used to expand opportunities for low-income people
and help make decent, affordable housing a reality for all, and to
make it possible for all homeless men, women and their families to
live in a decent home,'' said Kemp's letter.
   In a handwritten ``P.S,'' Kemp added that ``On this occasion of
the war on poverty, be assured of my desire to work full time to
win this war against poverty, homelessness and despair.''
   Saturday's marchers are, in part, the hard-core homeless, the
flat-broke dwellers of heating grates and abandoned cars and
cardboard boxes, whose drained spirits and bodies are so baffling
to visitors of wealthy America, so disquieting to the bustling
citizens who pass them by.
   Their plight is the most obvious _ but hardly the exclusive _
grievance of those who have gathered in Washington to knock on the
doors of Congress and the administration the past two days.
Organizers of the ``Housing Now!'' effort hope to muster 100,000 or
more for a march and rally on the Mall.
   Many of the demonstrators are the less visible homeless _ able
but jobless adults with children who subsist on welfare and live in
municipal shelters or dowdy motels.
   Many, too, are America's reluctant renters, young workers
struggling to secure their first mortgage. To them, the term
``affordable housing'' has become a contradiction in terms.
   The protest is backed by more than 200 national organizations,
including the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the YMCA, the
YWCA, the National Urban League, Catholic Charities USA, the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National
Organization for Women. Dozens of state and local politicians are
participating, as well as scores of celebrity activists.
   Hundreds of the marchers already are foot-weary.
   About 125 endured miserable weather and racial taunts on a
back-roads hike from Roanoke, Va.; 240 people came by foot from New
York City; others from North Carolina.
   Some are sleeping in churches and the homes of sympathizers;
some are camping here in tents in the parking lots of Robert F.
Kennedy stadium.
   In one confrontation on the steps of the Capitol, members of
Congress were shouted down by protesters who chanted: ``If you
didn't walk, you can't talk.'' Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., was
nudged from the podium by a homeless marcher who declared:
   ``It's time we stand up and speak for ourselves; we did not come
here to listen to any tight-collared politicians. It's time they
listen to us.''
   Conservative groups countered with seminars and white papers
extolling the promise of private enterprise for resolving the
nation's housing woes.
   Also, Irving Welfeld, a senior analyst in the Department of
Housing and Urban Development, told a conference Friday that claims
of a crisis in public housing are greatly exaggerated.
   Welfeld said there are 11.5 million vacant housing units in the
United States. ``Of these, 3.5 million are available'' to
low-income people, he said, or ``five to seven units for every
homeless person.''
   He complained that ``there is a general attitude in this country
that the sky is always falling ... somehow there is always a
housing crisis.''
   According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, there are an
estimated 3 million homeless people in the United States. That
figure has been repeatedly cited by march organizers and members of
Congress, but it is widely disputed. The liberal Urban Institute,
for example, said in 1988 that the homeless numbered no more than
600,000.
   Mitch Snyder, a Washington activist for the homeless, said
Friday, ``We already have the attention of virtually everyone in
America. What we don't have is the kind of pressure focused on
Congress and the administration that translates out in a policy in
money.'' He commented on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   Snyder and other activists have complained that the Reagan
administration cut the budget authority for federal housing
assistance programs by 77 percent _ from $32 billion to less than
$8 billion a year.
   But the Department of Housing and Urban Development says that
while budget authority _ the spending limit _ was lowered, actual
spending has risen almost 150 percent since 1978.
   Still, HUD's own figures indicate that at least 25 million
Americans spend more than half their income on housing. One in four
eligible poor renters receives federal help.
   Some conservatives, including former President Reagan, have
argued that homelessness has little to do with federal budget cuts,
but results from addiction and the release of mentally disturbed
people from institutions.
   Peter Ferrara, moderator of a conference Friday at the Cato
Institute, said that ``you could build more public housing and
these people would still be lying in the streets, because they are
unable to care for themselves.''
   Activists for the homeless vehemently disagree with that
portrayal, saying it ignores the growing numbers of homeless
children _ the Children's Defense League puts that figure at up to
750,000 _ as well as the affordability problem for adults who are
unemployed or underemployed.
   According to a Rutgers University report issued earlier in the
week, ``Unlike the stereotype of the Bowery Bum or the lone
drifter, today's homeless are, substantially, functioning adults
and families with children. They are a cross-section of our poverty
population.''
   On that score, the National Association of Realtors says the
ability of the typical American family to buy a home is at its
lowest level in years; Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies
said the percentage of young families owning homes fell from 71
percent in 1980 to 63 percent in 1988.
   ``I think there are very broad agreements among reasonable
people that you've got a big problem of affordability,'' said
Stuart Butler, director of domestic policy studies for the
conservative Heritage Foundation.
   Anthony Downs of the more liberal Brookings Institution agreed.
Those struggling to find adequate homes simply ``need more money,''
he said. ``What we're talking about fundamentally is poverty.''

<HEAD>Federal Government Will Pay Bigger-Than-Normal Share of Hugo Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has agreed to shoulder
a greater-than-normal share of the financial burden for damage
caused by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina, the White House
announced Friday.
   The federal government will pay 75 percent of all eligible costs
up to $34 million, and above that amount it will pay all costs,
according to the White House.
   Generally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency pays 75
percent of the eligible costs to repair roads, bridges, publicly
held utilities, parks and certain non-profit facilities. Beyond
that 75 percent, the costs must be paid by the state and local
governmemts.
   Under the new directive signed by President Bush, FEMA will take
on the last 25 percent as well in the case of South Carolina.
   The ceiling of $34 million on the first 75 percent was reached
by using a formula that says FEMA will pay 75 percent of the cost
until the total reaches the equivalent of $10 per capita. There are
3.4 million people in South Carolina.
   FEMA has not estimated the total cost of the storm damage caused
by last month's hurricane.
   Bush increased the federal government's share of the bill in
response to a request from South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell
Jr.

   Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., whose son died of
cancer after being exposed to Agent Orange that his father had
ordered sprayed in Vietnam, has been named a senior adviser to
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, the department said
Friday.
   The appointment of Zumwalt, 68, is one of several steps the VA
department has taken under Derwinski to address the concerns of
veterans who have health problems that they say are linked to
exposure to the defoliant.
   The VA said Zumwalt will counsel on a variety of issues, but
``the first on the agenda will be Agent Orange.''
   Zumwalt, who retired as chief of naval operations in 1974, was
commander of in-country naval forces in Vietnam in the late 1960s,
when Agent Orange was sprayed in the Mekong Delta.
   His son, Elmo R. Zumwalt III, had served as a patrol boat
commander at the same time. He died in August 1988 of a form of
cancer linked to Agent Orange exposure. He was 42.
   A grandson, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a congenital
dysfunction of his physical senses. Agent Orange has also been
blamed for birth defects.
   The father has said he still would have ordered spraying the
defoliant because overall casualties were reduced.
   The two co-wrote a book, ``My Father, My Son,'' about the
experience. It was later made into a television movie.
   On Monday, the VA Department published regulations creating
less-stringent guidelines for determining whether there is a link
between Agent Orange exposure and a host of ailments. A VA panel
will re-examine studies in November in light of the new guidelines.
   Government scientists have said there is no way of determining a
positive link, a position challenged by veterans groups and outside
scientists. The American Legion, for example, has released a major
study showing that exposure is related to benign fatty tumors,
adult acne, skin rash with blisters, several other ailments and an
increased risk of miscarriages in wives of veterans.
   Although the study said it couldn't determine a link with cancer
because the sample was too small, the legion said the methodology
proved such a study could be made.
   The new regulations allow for a link to be established if
studies ``permit the conclusion that it is at least as likely as
not that the purported relationship between a particular type of
exposure and a specific adverse health effect exists.''
   Some 35,000 veterans have filed Agent Orange claims, but only
five have been allowed because of the policy that no firm
connection exists. More than 230,000 veterans have reported their
exposure to the VA. About 2.6 million personnel served within the
borders of South Vietnam.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh
did not libel a former Indian prime minister in a book that called
the Indian official a paid CIA informant, a federal jury found
Friday.
   Jurors deliberated less than six hours over two days.
   Morarji Desai, India's prime minister from 1977 to 1979,
contended Hersh libeled him in his 1983 book, ``The Price of Power:
Kissinger in the Nixon White House,'' by writing that Desai was a
paid CIA informant.
   Desai's lawyer, Cyriac D. Kappil, asked the six-member jury to
award $3.5 million to his client. Desai, 94 and living in Bombay,
is ill and did not appear at the trial.
   ``It's a terribly important victory for any journalist,'' Hersh
said outside the courtroom after the verdict.
   ``I think it's going to make it easier for all the people in my
profession,'' he added. ``Nonetheless, it's also very chilling.
It's also very frightening to realize that you can write things
that can put you through a process like this.''
   Kappil said he disagreed with instructions U.S. District Judge
Charles R. Norgle gave the jury after the three-week trial. The
attorney said Desai's dispute centered on two chapters in the book,
but jurors were allowed to consider the whole book.
   ``The book went in (to the jury room) in its entirety. My
lawsuit dealt only with Chapter 32 and portions of 33,'' Kappil
said, adding that jurors' access to the book may have strengthened
their belief the disputed chapters were factual.
   He said he would confer with his client before deciding whether
to appeal.
   Kappil said in closing arguments Wednesday that Hersh libeled
Desai by writing that he had been paid $20,000 a year by the CIA
and been considered a valuable ``asset'' to the U.S. government
during the administrations of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.
   ``With the stroke of a pen, Mr. Hersh assassinated his
reputation, his honor,'' Kappil said.
   Defense lawyer Bernard J. Nussbaum countered that Hersh had
based his assertions about Desai on consistent information from a
half-dozen ``high level'' government sources.
   ``When you have that kind of information, doesn't the journalist
have a responsibility to publish it?'' Nussbaum said Wednesday.
   To reach a finding that libel occurred, jurors must conclude
that Hersh knowingly printed false material with malice, or with
reckless disregard for whether or not it was true.
   Kappil alleged that Hersh fabricated notes to back up the
assertions about Desai, and said the author knew the assertions
were false.
   ``It is entirely out of keeping with his career as a
journalist,'' Nussbaum said.
   Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting in 1970
for his coverage of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. He was a
reporter for The Associated Press and then The New York Times, and
left the newspaper to pursue his own writing.

<TEXT>
   More than 600 East Germans cheered
and embraced Friday as they entered West Germany aboard what many
feared might be the last freedom train to the West.
   Some spoke of the communities they had left _ ``towns without
bakers and shopkeepers'' who had already fled their communist
homeland.
   Despite tightened borders, the flow of would-be emigrants has
continued into Prague and Warsaw, where more than 100 East Germans
took refuge in the West German Embassy in hopes of following their
countrymen West.
   A train carrying 633 East German refugees arrived in Hanover
after a 14-hour ride from Warsaw and across their Communist
homeland. Those aboard had crowded the embassy in Warsaw.
   On Thursday, 7,600 East Germans who had sought sanctuary at the
West German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, were delivered by
freedom trains to West Germany. About 7,000 more arrived last
weekend on trains from Prague and Warsaw.
   In all, more than 47,000 East Germans have left their homeland
through Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia since mid-September,
when reformist Hungary sparked the exodus by opening its border to
the West.
   The new emigrants on the train from Warsaw said the exodus was
having severe effects on their homeland.
   ``Things are really bad in East Germany,'' said Lutz Kopecky,
29. ``There are towns without bakers and shopkeepers, and they're
having trouble keeping supplies moving.''
   But Kopecky, like others leaving East Germany, said he felt he
had to go because of the lack of democratic freedoms and slim
chances that things will change soon.
   Some refugees told of reluctantly leaving relatives behind.
   ``My son suddenly came down with a high fever, so he and his
mother stayed behind,'' one saddened man said. ``But I am going to
go through the authorities to try to get them out.''
   Other refugees said communist police, some with attack dogs,
lined the route through East Germany and that some train stations
were surrounded by barbed-wire fences.
   The heavy security was apparently meant to prevent a repeat of a
Wednesday night riot in Dresden, East Germany, where thousands of
people waited in hopes of boarding refugee trains but were forced
away by police swinging clubs.
   Nonetheless, a number of Friday's arrivals told of a young East
German couple and their child who succeeding in getting onto the
train just before it left Polish territory.
   ``The train doors were locked tight, but they were able to get
in through a window,'' one refugee said.
   Some people told of receiving help from Poles in their efforts
to join the exodus.
   ``We drove to Warsaw with mixed feelings,'' said Walter Irmshar,
40. ``But after we got there, the Poles were so helpful they even
showed us the way to the embassy.''
   The 633 refugees, who were accompanied on the train by West
German envoys, cheered, whistled and hugged each other when a local
politician welcomed them as ``my countrymen.''
   ``I'm not the type who gets tears in my eyes, but this time I
felt something deep down,'' said Manfred Mix, a 36-year-old refugee.
   They looked well-rested and more relaxed than those who arrived
earlier in the week from Czechoslovakia.
   West German officials and Red Cross workers had prepared
temporary housing and other forms of care.
   The journey came as East Germany, deeply embarrassed by the
exodus, began two days of celebrations marking its 40th anniversary.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived in East Berlin to
mark the anniversary and expressed ``complete confidence'' in East
Germans' ability to come to grips with the rising discontent. He
urged East Germans to ``be patient.''
   Flights to the West through Hungary were continuing, with 363
East German refugees taking that route in the past 24 hours,
Bavarian border officials said Friday.
   East Germans began making their way West through Hungary in May
when that Communist country removed obstacles from its border with
Austria. Since Hungary officially opened its borders Sept. 10,
about 32,000 East Germans have used that route to West Germany.
   Earlier this week, East Germany restricted travel to
Czechoslovakia in an attempt to staunch the flow of refugees, and
controls at East Germany's border with Poland have also been
tightened.
   Polish border guards have turned back 407 East Germans caught
attempting to enter Poland illegally since Sept. 18, the government
said Friday. But more than 100 others have reached the West German
Embassy in Warsaw.

   A lack of clear policy guidance from President
Bush was largely responsible for U.S. confusion in dealing with
Tuesday's Panamanian coup attempt, Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman Sam Nunn said Friday.
   Meanwhile, Sen. David Boren, chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, questioned whether Bush was given enough information, in
the right context, to make a crucial decision as the uprising took
place.
   U.S. forces had information indicating troops loyal to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega were being flown into Tocumen airport
several miles east of Panama City Tuesday morning, but had no
authorization to share that information with the rebels.
   However, said Boren, D-Okla., the rebels believed the
reinforcements were coming from another direction, and had asked
U.S. forces to block two other roads they believed would be used by
the loyalists, leaving the airport road clear.
   ``I just don't believe the information was distilled and
presented to (Bush) in a way that gave him an understanding of the
yes-or-no decision he had to make'' on whether to authorize
blocking of the airport road, Boren said.
   Boren also said no senior personnel from the Central
Intelligence Agency were present during White House meetings to
deal with the coup on Monday and Tuesday.
   Nunn said there should have been definite arrangements for how
U.S. troops were to react in the event of a coup.
   ``We have had a definite, longstanding policy in this country of
encouraging a coup'' in Panama, Nunn, D-Ga., told reporters. ``We
should anticipate that our policy ... might succeed. Then we have
to know what we're going to do next.''
   Nunn, who was among senators who met Friday with Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said many of the specific facts of the coup
remained murky and were under continuing congressional
investigation.
   A report from the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees was
being prepared, but was expected to be delayed by declassification
procedures at least until next week.
   Nunn complained, ``There were no real plans as to how the people
on the ground (in Panama) were to react'' if a coup took place. ``I
do think there were implicit kinds of commitments made when we
called for the overthrow.''
   Had U.S. officials known what questions to ask of the coup
leaders and under what circumstances they were free to intervene,
the outcome might have been far different, he said.
   Nunn said officials of the U.S. Southern Command, based in
Panama City, should have been under standing instructions to
determine the intent of any leaders of a coup: Did they intend to
recognize and support the duly elected government which was thrown
out by Noriega? Did they want U.S. intelligence data? Would they
turn Noriega over to U.S. authorities?
   On all of those questions, American personnel groped throughout
the morning Tuesday until any opportunity for the United States to
become involved evaporated, Nunn said.
   If there had been clear answers, ``The whole flow of events
might have changed. It would have put us in a totally different
legal and moral position,'' he said.
   Nunn said the United States failed to make proper use of its own
intelligence by bringing appropriate officials together and pooling
information flowing in from all sources. The situation was further
complicated by the simultaneous visit of President Salinas of
Mexico and a senior Soviet military official, he said.
   ``All of those entered into this'' and further underlined the
need for advance policy setting and contingency planning, said Nunn.
   On one disputed point _ whether the rebels asked for help in
getting Noriega out of the headquarters building where they held
him _ Nunn said he tended to accept Cheney's version that no such
request was made.
   During a visit to Capitol Hill Friday, Bush visited Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell to explain what he had known on
Tuesday when he decided not to commit U.S. force to the coup
attempt.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said he related to Bush the concern many
senators have about whether the United States passed up an
opportunity to apprehend Noriega, but said Bush and chief of staff
John Sununu ``emphatically and categorically'' denied such an
opportunity existed.

   The Ontario provincial government has averted a
transit strike that could have disrupted traffic to Sunday's
scheduled American League baseball playoff at the downtown SkyDome.
   After an announcement from the Ontario provincial government
that back-to-work legislation would be introduced Tuesday, union
and management of the Toronto Transit Commission announced that
normal schedules would resume Sunday.
   Gerry Phillips, the Ontario Labor Minister, said Thursday the
legislation would send the part-time employment issue to an
independent fact finder who would report back in eight or nine
months.
   The normally efficient transit system has operated erratically
for five weeks because of a ``work to rule'' slowdown by Local 113
of the Amalgamated Transit Union.
   A strike or management lockout Sunday had appeared likely. The
union opposes management plans to hire 450 part-time workers to
ease scheduling and take care of service at peak hours.
   Sunday's game would be the fifth in the best-of-seven playoff
series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Oakland Athletics, who won
the first two games at Oakland.
   ``This bill will get the parties back to work and give them the
tools to solve the one remaining issue,'' Phillips said in a
statement.
   Toronto residents have been allowing as much as 45 minutes'
extra travel time on the transit system, which operates subways,
buses and streetcars.
   The union had been planned to ignore new work schedules the
transit commission was introducing Sunday. Management threatened to
shut down the system in response.

<HEAD>Shamir Asks Baker To Set Up Talks On Palestinian Delegation</HEAD>

   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir asked
the Bush administration on Friday to set up talks to break a
deadlock on which Palestinian Arabs would participate in
negotiations for self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Shamir made the request after the Israeli Cabinet turned down,
by tie vote, a Labor Party proposal for a meeting with Egypt on the
difficult issue. He also offered assurances that Israel ``had not
closed the door on the peace process.''
   Shamir's request for U.S. intervention was aired in an interview
with Israel television and elaborated in discussions between U.S.
and Israeli officials.
   It represents an attempt to keep the process alive by having
Secretary of State James A. Baker III set up three-way talks with
Egypt and Israel on a principal sticking point.
   That is, whether two Palestinians who were deported during the
22-month rebellion in the territories should be included in the
Palestinian delegation.
   ``We await these proposals and when they arrive we will give
them serious consideration,'' Shamir said, according to Israeli
embassy spokeswoman Ruth Yaron.
   Meanwhile, a U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said Baker
was considering the idea as well as other ways to set up
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. The official insisted the peace
process was not at a dead end.
   ``We are working hard, and we are hopeful,'' he said.
   After the Cabinet's tie vote, Baker talked by telephone with
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister
Esmet Abdel-Meguid.
   A State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, insisted Israel
had not rejected Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's 10-point
proposal. ``Our view is that the Israeli Cabinet has held a full
discussion and neither accepted nor rejected the Egyptian ideas,''
he said.
   Mubarak had proposed negotiations in Cairo between an Israeli
delegation and Palestinians, including two who were deported from
the West Bank during the rebellion against Israeli control.
   Mubarak's approach also would require Israel to concede in
advance that it should relinquish territory on the West Bank and in
Gaza as a basis for gaining peace with the Arabs.
   The Egyptian leader put his proposal forward after the Palestine
Liberation Organization had declined to endorse a plan by Shamir to
hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live in
the territories.
   The elected Palestinians then would negotiate with Israel an
interim, five-year arrangement for local self-rule to be followed
by wider negotiations on an overall Middle East settlement.
   After Baker met last week in New York with Arens and
Abdel-Meguid he called on the Israeli Cabinet to decide how to
``move forward'' on the Shamir proposal. Otherwise, Baker said at a
news conference Friday: ``We will have to go back to the drawing
board.''
   But after the Israeli Cabinet deadlocked, U.S. officials said
there was no reason to start afresh. Instead, the officials said,
Baker intended to keep the discussions going while also seeking an
accommodation between the Shamir and Mubarak approaches.
   ``Any conclusion that it's over because it didn't happen today
is just not right,'' Boucher said. ``I don't think the secretary
put any time limit on this.''
   The spokesman said Baker was not planning to go to the Middle
East to continue the discussions.
   Baker endorsed the Shamir plan after it was adopted by the
Israeli Cabinet last May. He has also praised the 10 points
unveiled by Mubarak last month, but said they were no substitute
for Shamir's proposal.
   On a related subject, Boucher confirmed reports that Robert
Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, recently held two
additional meetings with an official of the Palestine Liberation
Organzation.
   The spokesman declined to disclose what they talked about.
   The PLO news agency, WAFA, said the meetings concerned ``the
efforts under way and the positions of the different concerned
parties to realize a net gain in the peace process.''
   Pelletreau has been meeting in Carthage with PLO officials since
December. The State Department has given only skimpy reports of the
sessions.

<HEAD>General Assembly Denounces Israeli Crackdown on Palestinian Uprising</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The General Assembly on Friday condemned
Israel's ``killing and wounding of defenseless Palestinian
civilians'' in revolt in the Occupied Territories.
   A resolution denouncing Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip passed by 140 votes, with only Israel and the United States
voting against it. All other Western nations and Japan voted for
condemnation.
   Six nations abstained: Uruguay, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
El Salvador, Zaire, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada.
   ``Conveniently absent from the resolution is any reference to
the resort to violence by Palestinian extremists,'' said Israeli
Ambassador Johanan Bein.
   Noting that at least 120 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs who accused them of collaborating with Israel, Bein said the
residents of the occupied territories: ``Indeed they need
protection; Palestinian citizens are being slain by PLO
terrorists.''
   Bein denounced the Palestine Liberation Organization for
encouraging an arson campaign to set forest fires in the
territories and Israel:
   ``The war by the PLO is against the land itself, and is nothing
but wild destruction.''
   Farouk Khaddoumi, the PLO's foreign secretary, retorted that
``Israel claims to be distressed about the trees that are being
burned, when children are being killed, and children are being
jailed by the thousands.''
   The second-ranking U.S. ambassador, Alexander F. Watson,
explained the negative American vote by saying ``Resolutions
incorporating one-sided and unbalanced rhetoric do not help
alleviate the conditions they purport to describe ... such
resolutions only deepen divisions, harden positions and poison the
atmosphere.''
   The resolution expresses ``profound shock at the continued
measures by Israel, the occupying power, including the killing and
wounding of Palestinian civilians and the recent action of
ransacking the houses of defenseless citizens in the Palestinian
town of Beit Sahour.''
   Israel began tax raids on Beit Sahour on Sept. 20, and troops
have confiscated at least $500,000 worth of household goods and
machinery.
   The mayor of Beit Sahour, Hanna Al-Atrash, estimated that 90
percent of the town has boycotted Israeli taxes.
   The General Assembly resolution ``condemns'' such practices as
``the opening of fire by the Israeli army and settlers that result
in the killing and wounding of defenseless Palestinian civilians,
the beating and breaking of bones, the deportation of Palestinian
civilians,'' and economic crackdowns.
   Israelis have killed more than 580 Palestinians during the
22-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Palestinians have killed more than 120 suspected Arab
collaborators, and 40 Israelis have died in the uprising.
   About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the Occupied Territories.
   The General Assembly took up the Palestine resolution the same
day that Israel's divided inner Cabinet rejected an Egyptian peace
plan calling for talks with a Palestinian delegation in Cairo.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev advised East Germans to ``be
patient, don't panic'' as he paid a 40th anniversary visit Friday
to a country torn by dissent and rejected by tens of thousands of
citizens.
   But in an apparent hint that East Germany's aging leaders should
soften their hard line, he urged them to work with ``all forces in
society'' to solve the country's problems.
   Political suppression and authoritarianism have led to a growing
number of opposition groups. One delivered an appeal for help from
Gorbachev to the Soviet Embassy on Friday.
   Police fought protesters in Dresden and Magdeburg, and communist
authorities barred Western tourists from East Berlin. Dissatisfied
East Germans continued fleeting to freedom in the West.
   Unconfirmed reports by the Hamburg newspaper Die Welt and West
Germany's ZDF television said East Germany was building barbed wire
fences on its borders with Poland and Czechoslovakia, communist
allies refugees have used to reach the West.
   Gorbachev expressed ``complete confidence'' in the leadership's
ability to deal wtth discontent, declaring: ``We know our German
friends well and their ability to think through problems, to learn
from life and to make corresponding political changes if they are
necessary.''
   Some in the crowd called out: ``Gorby, help us! Gorby, keep it
up!'' to the Soviet leader, whose reforms have been rejected by
their government.
   ``Be patient, don't panic and don't be sad. We are very close
partners and we will solve our problems and struggles together,''
Gorbachev told about 1,000 East Germans at a monument for victims
of fascism.
   ``We're staying here!'' several onlookers shouted.
   Speaking Friday night to the party hierarchy and hundreds of
invited guests, Gorbachev said: ``We have heard demands such as the
U.S.S.R. should take down the Berlin Wall and then people could
believe in (the Soviet Union's) peaceful aims. Our Western partners
should understand that questions regarding (East Germany) are not
solved in Moscow but in Berlin. '
   In appealing to the leadership, Gorbachev said: ``There is no
doubt that the Socialist Unity Party has the intellectual
potential, rich experience and political authority to cooperate
with all forces in society to answer the questions placed on
today's agenda.''
   The public welcome for Gorbachev appeared subdued in comparison
with enthusiastic receptions in the United States, West Germany and
elsewhere. Most people allowed on the downtown motorcade route were
chosen by authorities.
   Erich Honecker, the wily, 77-year-old who has run the country
for nearly two decades, used his own speech to reaffirm the hard
line and condemn international efforts toward the ``destabilization
of socialism.''
   For the first time in recent memory, East German television did
not carry a live broadcast on the Soviet leader's arrival.
   Asked if he thought the situation in East Germany was dangerous,
he said: ``I don't think so. Held up against our problems, there is
no comparison. Nothing surprises us anymore.''
   In a clear reference to opponents of his reforms, Gorbachev
said: ``Those who grasp the impulse of society and base their
policy on that have no reason to be afraid.''
   East Berlin was decked with huge red banners, flags and posters
praising accomplishments of the communist nation founded Oct. 7,
1949.
   Honecker was reported gravely ill after gallbladder surgery in
August. Asked about his health Friday, he replied with a smile:
``People pronounced dead keep on living.''
   Communist authorities closed at least three of the nine crossing
points from West Berlin to East Berlin to Western tourists on
Friday. Western allies strongly protested the closings, saying it
violated the right to free travel.
   ``I wanted to see the celebration and all the Communist hype.
I'm extremely disappointed,'' Joel Gardner of Washington, D.C.,
said at Checkpoint Charlie.
   Church sources, speaking to The Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity, said heavy police forces with clubs, tear
gas and water cannon patrolled through the country's major cities
following the clashes.
   The sources said about 200 people had been arrested and at least
four seriously injured in the clashes late Thursday.
   To squelch any further protests, the Communist leadership
stepped up security nationwide, while communist paramilitary
workers' groups in Leipzig vowed to take up guns if needed to crush
opposition movements.
   West Germany's ZDF television and church sources reported
clashes beteen protesters and police in Dresden and Magdeburg.
   In Magdeburg, north of Leipzig, police clashed with about 600
people who joined in a silent march through the city after a church
prayer late Thursday.
   There was street fighting in Dresden two times earlier this week
as mostly young citizens hoped to board trains carrying other East
Germans to a new life in the West.
   More than 47,000 East Germans have turned their backs to their
communist homeland since mid-September in a mass exodus unseen
since the Berlin Wall was constructed in 1961.
   A train carrying 633 East Germans arrived in West Germany on
Friday from Poland. More than 360 others took advantage of
Hungary's open-border policy and arrived from there.

   Discarding its once-sacrosanct policy of
unilateral nuclear disarmament, Britain's opposition Labor Party
completed a transformation at its annual convention this week.
   From rambunctious, radical and noisily left-wing, the socialist
movement has shifted to the center, spruced up its image, dumped
its old working-class rallying cries and borrowed some of
Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's clothes.
   The reward has been Labor's most commanding and consistent lead
in polls since the party lost power to Mrs. Thatcher a decade ago.
   The price, dismayed Labor leftists complain, has been the
party's soul.
   ``They (the Labor leaders) aim to win by detaching the Labor
Party as a whole,'' former energy secretary Tony Benn, doyen of the
Labor left, complained during the weeklong party conference that
ended Friday in Brighton.
   But for the socialist anthem, ``The Red Flag,'' this year's
convention was scarcely recognizable as a British socialist
gathering. Even the red flags were gone.
   There were hardly any Marxists shoving tracts at delegates; no
howling down of party leaders by left-wingers; fewer jeans,
T-shirts and ban-the-bomb symbols; more collars and ties, more
coiffured hairdos.
   The turnaround on Britain's nuclear arsenal _ an issue that has
bedeviled the Labor Party more than 30 years _ was endorsed with
almost studied calm as part of a wholesale revamping of the party
platform.
   There was no hint of the uproar of 1981, when the convention,
moving left, adopted the no-nuclear-weapons doctrine, which played
a key role in Labor's electoral defeats in 1983 and 1987.
   There was none of the drama with which Aneurin Bevan, an
architect of the welfare state, headed off unilateralism in 1957,
when he pleaded to the convention not to be sent ``naked into the
conference chamber.''
   This year, the 3-2 vote to ditch unilateralism was greeted with
scattered applause, a few scarcely audible boos, and then silence.
   It was a triumph for party leader Neil Kinnock, the one time
left-winger and ardent anti-nuclear campaigner, who has shifted
markedly in the six years since he took over. But it is only since
1987, and Labor's third successive trouncing by Mrs. Thatcher, that
he has succeeded in clamping down.
   ``Ours is the winning way,'' declared 47-year-old Kinnock, who
aims to become prime minister by mid-1992, the deadline for the
next general election.
   Other key changes adopted by the convention included dropping
commitments to re-nationalize most of the state-owned industries
sold off by Mrs. Thatcher, and abolishing some _ but not all _ of
the curbs she has imposed on trade union freedom.
   The new policy calls for abandoning Britain's submarine-launched
nuclear missiles only as part of an international disarmament
accord. U.S. bases will be allowed to remain in Britain, and a
Labor government would buy the U.S. Trident nuclear missiles
ordered by the Thatcher government.
   It envisages a top income tax bracket of 50 percent, compared
with 83 percent when Labor was last in government.
   The Conservatives, who hold their convention next week, dismiss
the changes as public relations touches by an avowedly socialist
party. But they are clearly on the defensive.
   Inflation is above 7 percent, the pound is weak, and on
Thursday, interest rates were hiked to 15 percent, the 11th
increase since June 1988. Labor is 5 to 12 points ahead in polls.
   Denis Kavanagh, professor of politics at Nottingham University,
noted that Labor's big problem was being associated with ``union
power, high taxation, old-fashioned nationalism and weakness on
defense.''
   ``These findings are not new,'' Kavanagh wrote in London's
Sunday Times. ``What has changed since 1987 is the leadership's
determination to dump unpopular baggage.''

   Banjo-stealing bears, a resurrected
cat and other oddities of Americana were featured at the 17th
annual National Storytelling Festival opening Friday.
   The festival, which continues through Sunday, is expected to
draw 6,000 people from around the country, organizers said. The 15
featured storytellers are expected to be joined by dozens of others
who like to practice the art.
   ``It's a vice,'' said Robert Rodriguez, a teacher from New York
who attended the first festival in 1973.
   At the ``Swappin' Ground,'' where the audience sat on bales of
hay while listening to tales, Rodriguez told about three brothers
who were quizzed about the meaning of Easter.
   One confused it with Thanksgiving, another Halloween. The third
at least had Jesus in his version. But he believed that Christ
arose after three days and saw his shadow. That meant six more
weeks of winter.
   Jay Stailey of Texas told about a dog owner in ``upper level
management for IBM'' who believed his pet had killed a neighbor's
beloved cat. When the dog dragged the muddy corpse of the cat to
his home, the man cleaned it and took the dead animal back to its
house.
   The next day, he discovered the cat had died two days earlier
and had been buried. The cat's owner found it strange the cat
suddenly appeared in its favorite sleeping spot.
   Stailey was one of 10 regional winners of storytelling contests
who told tales Friday afternoon. The regional contests were
sponsored by the National Association for the Preservation and
Perpetuation of Storytelling. The group is also sponsoring the
festival.
   This year, a contest for elementary school students will be used
to try to interest children in storytelling.
   David Holt, a Texas native now living Asheville, N.C., used a
banjo as a prop while he told about Uncle Ike, who had his banjo
taken by a bear. Holt, one of the 15 featured storytellers, also
told the fairy tale of ``Sleeping Beauty,'' who pricked her finger
on a spinning wheel and fell asleep for 100 years.
   The first festival was held in this northeast Tennessee
community in 1973 and brought together four storytellers and 60
people who listened to tales told from the back of a farm wagon at
the Washington County courthouse, according to Jimmy Neil Smith,
creator of the festival.
   Smith thinks storytelling has been revived in recent years
because of disenchantment with television and radio. ``We were
overcome, overwhelmed by those forces,'' he said.
   Smith said organizers tried to bring together a diverse group of
storytellers. Home for the featured storytellers include
California, Minnesota, Nevada, Massachusetts and Zimbabwe and
Scotland.
   Some storytellers came just to listen and won't be sharing their
tales this weekend. And some of the spectators may spin tales as
well.
   Edward Cattey and his wife, Barbara, both retired teachers,
traveled to the festival from Wallington, Conn., for the third
consecutive year.
   ``I'm a good listener,'' Mrs. Cattey said.

   A 13-ton quilt memorializing the more than
12,000 people who have died from AIDS was unfolded on the Ellipse
across from the White House on Friday, marking the final time it is
to be displayed in the nation's capital.
   The quilt, making its third appearance in Washington, was to be
the centerpiece of weekend activities, including a caldlelight
march to the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday, the addition of the
names of 300 more victims of the disease and the reading of all the
name aloud.
   The quilt consists of 10,848 panels containing the names and
some personal items of AIDS victims.
   As of Aug. 31, 61,655 people were known to have died of AIDS in
the United States since June 1 1981.
   The Names Project Foundation will continue to display the quilt
in other cities both in the United States and aboard, usually
showing only parts of it.

   Showers and thunderstorms developed along a cold front from
central Texas through the middle Mississippi Valley to West
Virginia on Friday.
   There were also a few showers in the Northeast, over the
northern Rockies and the northern high Plains region and in the
central Gulf Coast region.
   Fair to partly sunny skies prevailed across the rest of the
nation.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hour period ending at 2 p.m.
EDT included four-tenths of an inch at Parkersburg, W.Va. and a
third of an inch at Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.
   Thunderstorms developing along the cold front produced severe
weather in Texas and Oklahoma on Thursday evening. One person was
killed in central Oklahoma when strong thunderstorm winds hit the
town of Pocasset, downing power lines and damaging a mobile home.
   Thunderstorms over the Texas Panhandle produced wind gusts to 80
mph at White Deer, which damaged roofs and blew over a pickup. A
thunderstorm at Shamrock, Texas, produced wind gusts to 60 mph.
   Strong northwesterly winds continued Friday to bring cold air
into the north-central states, with winds to 30 mph in the upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Temperatures warmed into the 80s on Friday afternoon from
south-central Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast states. Readings
soared into the 90s in south-central Texas.
   Corpus Christi, Texas, set a new record high for the date with a

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech to East German Communist Party and government
officials Friday at a celebration of the country's 40th anniversary:
   The event that we are commemorating today has great political
meaning. The creation of a workers' state in the eastern part of
Germany has had a fundamental effect on the history of postwar
Europe and has influenced the course of world history.
   In an historically short period the leadership of the German
Democratic Republic brought about a deep social and economic
restructuring. By the 1960s the German Democratic Republic had
found a firm place among the top 10 industrially developed nations
of the world and its economy continues to grow. And everyone knows
the successes that have been achieved in everyday life. ...
   Of course, the German Democratic Republic, like all countries,
has its own problems of development, demanding well thought-out
solutions. They are determined by the internal needs of
modernization and renewal, which the whole socialist world has now
gotten down to.
   All governments are going through a process of integration,
restructuring of international politics and the economic order.
Nobody can avoid taking part in the global problems and demands of
the world technological revolution. ... There is no doubt that the
Socialist Unity Party has the intellectual potential, rich
experience and political authority to cooperate with all forces in
society to answer the questions placed on today's agenda.
   The Soviet Union is sincerely interested that East Germany
continues to grow and develop.
   The relationships between socialist countries are characterized
by equality, self-reliance and solidarity. Diversity is no obstacle
and is, in contrast, a further important reason for the development
of cooperation.
   We have heard demands for example that the Soviet Union should
tear down the Berlin Wall because only then could one finally
believe in our peaceful intentions. Recently in West Germany voices
have been heard suggesting the reunification of Germany within the
borders of 1937. And Silesia in Poland also has been mentioned. Our
Western partners should understand that questions regarding the
German Democratic Republic are solved not in Moscow but in Berlin.
The German Democratic Republic is a sovereign state which
undertakes its own independent actions in defense of its interests
and its domestic and foreign policy.
   If one believes recent polls in West Germany, many young people
believe that the Soviet Union was responsible for the division of
Germany after the war. But they must be reminded that the Soviet
Union's position was just the opposite. It argued for the unity of
Germany.
   We don't idealize the order that has come about in Europe, but
the most important thing is that we now recognize the realities of
postwar Europe to ensure peace in Europe.
   Every time the West has attempted to change the postwar map of
Europe it has led to renewed international tension and an increased
danger of nuclear war and never contributed to a solution to actual
problems that touched the interests of people.
   We look optimistically at the chances for progress in European
and world politics. The agreements just reached in Wyoming are good
news for the world. President Bush in his speech to the United
Nations talked of his readiness to jointly work toward solving a
broad range of international problems and undertakings that face
us. I welcome this announcement and attach great importance to the
new Soviet-American summit meeting.

<HEAD>Bridge Linking Mainland, Barrier Islands Back in Place</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only bridge linking the mainland and
two barrier islands reopened to limited traffic Friday, two weeks
after Hurricane Hugo ripped the span apart.
   Traffic on the Ben Sawyer Bridge was limited to one direction,
with the direction changing every two hours. The bridge was
scheduled to close at sundown and reopen Saturday morning.
   Residents of Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island, 10 miles
outside Charleston, have used boats or taken ferries to their homes
since the hurricane tossed one end of the swing bridge into the
Intracoastal Waterway.
   ``It was wonderful not to have to climb over rocks, not to have
to climb over docks and then get into a car,'' said Isle of Palms
Mayor Carmen Bunch, who was in the first car to drive over the
bridge.
   Traffic was light during the first few hours the bridge was
opened.
   ``In fact, the only people they are allowing are people that
live on the island or have legal business,'' said Capt. H.G.
Holloman of the state Highway Patrol.
   Officials from the two island communities agreed to close the
bridge from 7 p.m. to 8 a.m. until further notice to keep out those
who do not live or work there. The highway patrol monitored traffic
while the islands' police departments checked driver's licenses
Friday, Holloman said.
   Engineers were still inspecting the bridge, though, and it was
not clear when it would be open to boat traffic on the Intracoastal
Waterway.
   So far, repairs have cost $700,000 to $1 million, said Brian
Ellison, spokesman for the state Department of Highways and Public
Transportation.
   Hugo hit the coast on Sept. 21 with 135 mph winds, leaving at
least 18 dead in South Carolina and damaging and destroying homes,
businesses, schools and municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were
killed on the U.S. mainland; at least 33 wee killed in the
Caribbean.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said damage in South Carolina was revised
upward to $4 billion to $5 billion, from a preliminary estimate of
$3 billion. The new figure was based on discussions with county
officials, state department chiefs and emergency management
officials, said Campbell's spokesman, Tucker Eskew.
   The state Department of Insurance has estimated $3.17 billion in
insured losses alone. Insurers expect to receive 350,000 claims.
   Also Friday, President Bush agreed to the governor's request
that the federal government pay a larger portion of the cost of
cleanup and repairs, saving state and local governments at least
$20 million in law enforcement, road and bridge repairs, cleaning
debris, water control on dams, uninsured losses to public buildings
and utility costs.
   ``We know that we have a huge exposure and it's going to save us
lots of money,'' Campbell said.
   Cleanup costs in South Carolina alone have been put at about
$217 million.
   The state Employment Security Commission on Friday estimated
South Carolina's economy would lose $168 million if the 292,000
residents unemployed since Hugo do not return to work after three
weeks, executive director Robert E. David said.
   Only about 33,000 residences and businesses remained without
power Friday in the Charleston and Summerville areas, with
scattered outages in rural areas hard-hit by the hurricane. At one
point, nearly 1 million people in the Carolinas were without power.

<HEAD>Young &amp; Rubicam Indicted, Accused of Jamaica Bribes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of the country's largest advertising
agencies was indicted Friday on charges it paid nearly $1 million
in bribes over five years to obtain and keep the Jamaican Tourist
Board's ad account.
   A federal grand jury on Friday returned the 43-page indictment
against Young &amp; Rubicam, three of its current or former executives
and two former Jamaican officials, said U.S. Attorney Stanley A.
Twardy.
   The indictment alleges that starting in 1981 and continuing for
the next 5{ years, two Young &amp; Rubicam executives funneled payments
through Arnold Foote Jr., a Jamaican businessman, to Eric Anthony
Abrahams, who was Jamaica's Minister of Tourism at the time.
   Both Foote and Abrahams were charged with racketeering. Twardy
said his office, working with the U.S. State Department, will seek
their extradition.
   Young &amp; Rubicam, along with executive Arthur R. Klein and former
executive Thomas Spangenberg, were charged with racketeering and
conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Steven M.
McKenna, another Y&amp;R executive, was charged with perjury.
   The New York-based agency, which developed the ``Come back to
Jamaica'' ad campaign and still holds the account, denied any
impropriety.
   ``We are shocked and dismayed by this move. We believe these
allegations are based on speculation and innuendo and are without
substance or merit,'' Young &amp; Rubicam said in a 2{-page statement
Friday.
   The company, with annual billings of more than $5 billion, is
the largest privately held advertising firm in the country. Its
clients include Kraft General Food, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Colgate
and Dr. Pepper.
   The Jamaica account is relatively small. Twardy said it amounted
to $29 million over five years, and the company said Friday it
represents less than one one-thousandth of the company's worldwide
billings.
   Federal prosecutors opened the investigation in 1986 after
reading diaries seized from author Robin Moore, formerly of
Westport, Conn., during an investigation into phony tax shelters,
Twardy said.
   Moore, author of best-sellers such as ``The Green Berets'' and
``The French Connection,'' pleaded guilty in 1986 to unrelated tax
charges and cooperated fully in the Young &amp; Rubicam investigation,
Twardy said.
   Twardy said Moore, who has business interests in Jamaica dating
back 40 years, was an ``essential go-between, a middleman'' who
knew about the scheme and profited from it. He will not be charged,
Twardy said.
   ``He was forthcoming as to his knowledge of all illegal
activities, including this one,'' Twardy said.
   Twardy said the kickback scheme took shape shortly after
Abrahams became tourism minister. According to the indictment,
Abrahams summoned an advertising executive to his office and asked
him how the previous administration had handled kickbacks. When
told there had been none, Abrahams responded, ``Things may be
different in the new administration,'' the indictment said.
   According to the indictment, Moore and an associate, Frederick
Sturges, set up the initial meetings between the Jamaicans and
Young &amp; Rubicam executives.
   Twardy said the company agreed to take the account for a 15
percent commission _ 2 percent more than the Jamaican government
had previously paid _ agreeing at the same time to kick back
one-third of the commission to Abrahams and Foote.
   Most of the alleged payoffs were routed through a ``sham
advertising firm'' set up by Foote that had secret Caribbean bank
accounts, Twardy said.
   Foote is described in the indictment as a prominent citizen with
close political ties to the administration of Prime Minister Edward
Seaga, who took office in 1980.
   The indictment does not trace any of the money directly to
Abrahams, who was tourism minister from 1980 to 1985 and was a
member of the Jamaican Parliament from 1980 to 1986. Asked if the
investigation had done so, Twardy responded, ``We can trace it, but
it's not in the indictment, and it's not appropriate for me to
comment on it.''
   At the time of the alleged offenses, Klein was an executive vice
president, Spangenberg was a vice president, and McKenna was a
senior vice president. One of the three, Spangenberg, is no longer
with the company, Twardy said.
   In its statement, the company also said that Foote and Abrahams
both steadfastly denied that money from Young &amp; Rubicam went
through Foote's company to Abrahams.
   The company said it conducted its own internal investigation and
found no illegal acts.
   If convicted on all counts, Klein and Spangenberg face up to 25
years in jail and fines of up to $500,000, Twardy said. McKenna
faces up to five years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000. Young
&amp; Rubicam faces up to $1 million in fines, and forfeiture of about
$3.75 million it made from the Jamaican contract.
   Abrahams and Foote both face 20 years and up to $250,000 in
fines.

<HEAD>Cabinet Votes Down Proposal to Meet Palestinians in Cairo</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with U.S. efforts to continue talks, Shamir
speaking of U.S. proposal.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaders of Israel's coalition government cast a
tie vote Friday, in effect a rejection, on an Egyptian plan to hold
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo as a step toward reviving Middle
East peace efforts.
   Some ministers in the Labor Party, which backed Egypt's
proposal, said the left-center party should leave the coalition
with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc. Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres said it will be considered.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was seeking to keep negotiations alive. They said that
after the Israeli Cabinet vote Baker talked by telephone with
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister
Esmet Abdel-Meguid.
   Israel's policy-making inner Cabinet of 12 members voted 6-6
along party lines on a Labor motion to accept the proposal by
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Egypt is the only Arab country to
sign a peace treaty with Israel. A tie vote amounted to rejection.
   Mubarak's plan was to hold talks about the Israeli proposal that
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip elect delegates for
negotiations with Israel.
   Likud objects to the Mubarak suggestion that former residents of
the occupied lands be included in the Palestinian delegation to
Cairo talks.
   Shamir told members of the inner Cabinet that acceptance of
exile delegates ``would bring the PLO into the peace process, and
Israel would have entered into the peace process which could lead
to a Palestinian state.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor said of the vote:
``Israel today suffered a severe setback. ... I am very
disappointed.''
   Palestine Liberation Organization representative Nabil Shaath
said in Cairo the rejection brought peace efforts ``back again to
stagnation.''
   Abdel-Meguid was less pessimistic, saying without elaboration
that ``consultations are under way with the United States and
Israel.'' He spoke with reporters in Cairo.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher insisted Israel had
not rejected Mubarak's proposal. ``Our view is that the Israeli
Cabinet has held a full discussion and neither accepted nor
rejected the Egyptian ideas,'' he said in Washington.
   Baker met last week in New York with Arens and Abdel-Meguid. He
urged the Israeli Cabinet to ``move forward'' on the Shamir
proposal and at a news conference Friday he said if the Cabinet did
not, ``We will have to go back to the drawing board.''
   But after the tie vote U.S. officials said there was no reason
to start afresh. Instead Baker intends to keep the discussions
going while seeking an accommodation between the Shamir and Mubarak
approaches, they said.
   Boucher said, ``Any conclusion that it's over because it didn't
happen today is just not right. I don't think the secretary put any
time limit on this.''
   After the Cabinet meeting Shamir said Baker's efforts could
restart the peace process.
   ``There is an American idea, maybe even a proposal for some kind
of a meeting with the Arabs of Judea, Samaria and Gaza in better
circumstances for us,'' Shamir said on Israel televsion, using the
biblical names of Judea and Samaria for the occupied West Bank.
   After the inner Cabinet vote, Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev of
Labor said he believed time had run out for the 10-month-old
``national unity'' coalition. Labor has threatened previously to
leave the goverment over the peace stalemate.
   Peres told reporters Friday: ``I don't know if I will recommend
leaving the government or other steps, but it's clear that this
requires us to draw conclusions.''
   Mubarak also urged three other steps that Likud opposed and
Labor favored: endorsement of the U.S.-backed concept of trading
land for peace; a freeze on building Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories; and participation in the elections by Arabs
in east Jerusalem, which the government has declared part of Israel.
   The Israeli initiative, which the government endorsed in May,
calls for the election of Palestinians to negotiate an interim
autonomy agreement with Israel. The final status of the occupied
lands would be determined later.

   The largest decline in payrolls at auto plants
and other factories in nearly seven years helped push the nation's
jobless rate to 5.3 percent in September, the government said
Friday in a report showing unexpected softness in the economy.
   The civilian unemployment rate was up from 5.2 percent in both
July and August, the Labor Department said in the first
comprehensive look at the economy last month.
   Non-farm employers told the government they added a seasonally
adjusted 209,000 jobs in September, more than double a revised
88,000 in August. But, nearly all of the growth can be attributed
to two special factors: teachers returning to their classrooms and
75,000 telephone workers ending a strike, analysts said.
   ``This report is the first in quite a while that suggests the
economy could be heading for a tailspin,'' said economist Allen
Sinai of the Boston Co. ``... Another report like this one would
begin to cause a good deal of worry.''
   Manufacturers reported a loss of 103,000 jobs, including 33,000
at auto plants. It was the biggest drop since November 1982 at the
end of the last recession. Payrolls either declined or were flat
within all manufacturing industries except food processing.
   ``The most disturbing feature of September's business survey
data was the large decline in manufacturing employment,''
Commissioner of Labor Statistics Janet L. Norwood told Congress'
Joint Economic Committee. ``Real growth in overall factory
employment ended last March; since then, we have lost 135,000
factory jobs.''
   Unemployment in Michigan, home of many auto plants, leapt from
6.9 percent in August to 8.1 percent last month, the highest among
11 large industrial states surveyed.
   Reacting to the data, the stock market rallied. Brokers took
sluggish job growth as a sign that the Federal Reserve Board has
more leeway to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 11.96 to 2,785.52.
   Early last year, the Fed embarked on a year-long program of
raising interest rates to slow the economy and cool inflationary
pressures.
   Then, after signs of sluggishness emerged this spring,
particularly in interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as
construction and auto manufacturing, the central bank nudged rates
down a bit, hoping to keep the nation from toppling into a
recession.
   Data for July and August indicated the Fed appeared to be
getting what it wanted _ slower, but sustained, growth. However,
with Friday's employment report, some analysts said the Fed, which
hasn't loosened credit since mid-July, must do more to guard
against a downturn.
   ``I have felt the Federal Reserve for some time has been less
worried about deflation and unemployment than it should be,'' said
Jeffrey Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a
union-funded think tank. ``... I just think they're courting
disaster.''
   According to minutes released Friday of an Aug. 22 meeting,
Federal Reserve policymakers were satisified with the moderate pace
of growth and convinced that the economy was not as week as feared
only months earlier.
   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Friday
that Americans took out $3.48 billion more in consumer debt than
they retired in August, resuming their borrowing practices after
reducing their debt 0.9 percent in July, the first decline in 2{
years.
   Overall, the unemployment rate has changed little over the last
12 months. A year ago, it was 5.4 percent, moving down to a 15-year
low of 5.0 percent in March. Since then, it has fluctuated narrowly
between 5.1 percent and 5.3 percent.
   In September, 117.5 million Americans held jobs and 6.6 million
were looking for work, essentially unchanged from August.
   However, in a worrisome sign, the government said for the first
time in 6{ years, more industries lost jobs than gained, indicating
that weakness is spreading more generally throughout the economy.
   The jobless rate reported by the Labor Department is derived
from a survey of American households. A separate survey of
businesses provides the job growth figures.
   September job growth was artificially bolstered by the return of
striking telephone workers. But in the household survey strikers
are counted as employed, so their return did not affect the
unemployment rate.
   Of the 95,000 government jobs added, 87,000 were at local
governments, a swing the Labor Department attributed largely to the
end of summer vacation for school employees.
   Average hourly earnings of non-farm workers rose 0.5 percent to
$9.73 last month after holding steady in August. For the year
ending in September, average hourly earnings increased 3.8 percent,
well behind the rate of consumer price inflation.
   The average manufacturing work week and factory overtime edged
up 0.1 hour to 41.0 and 3.8 hours, respectively, offsetting small
declines in August.
   Here are the September unemployment rates for some demographic
groups listed in the Labor Department's report, compared with
August:
   _Adult white men, 4.2 percent, up from 3.8 percent.
   _Adult white women, 3.8 percent, down from 4.1 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 12.1 percent, down from 12.8 percent.
   _Blacks, 11.6 percent, up from 11.1 percent.
   _Adult black men, 10.0 percent, up from 9.8 percent.
   _Adult black women, 9.6 percent, up from 9.4 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 37.3 percent, up from 31.6 percent.
   _Hispanics, 8.3 percent, down from 9.0 percent.
   In a separate calculation that includes military personnel
stationed in the United States, the Labor Department said the
unemployment rate was 5.2 percent, up from August's 5.1 percent.

   The White House and Senate Democrats neared a
deal Friday to speed work on a deficit-reduction bill by keeping it
free of controversial special-interest provisions, including
President Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut.
   Late in a day of publicly made offers and counteroffers, private
meetings and news conferences, Senate leaders of both parties had
come close to agreeing to a Democratic proposal for a stripped-down
budget bill.
   In exchange, Democrats would agree to guarantee a separate vote
on capital gains in the next few weeks. Republican supporters of a
capital gains tax cut believe they would win such a vote.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
Republicans still wanted Democratic leaders in the House, which has
already passed its own version of a capital gains reduction, to
promise to work out a compromise bill with the Senate. A meeting
among House and Senate leaders was scheduled for Saturday.
   ``I think we're pretty close to an agreement,'' Bentsen said.
   Friday morning, Bush traveled to Capitol Hill to discuss the
situation with Senate Republicans.
   ``Capital gains is vital,'' he said before the meeting. ``It's
not an extraneous matter with me.''
   The Senate's majority Democrats, who first offered to pare down
the bill Thursday night, said debate on the measure would begin
with an unusual Saturday session.
   In a late-night session this week, the Senate Finance Committee
approved a package of revenue increases raising $37 billion over
the next five years. The panel then voted to help dozens of
interest groups by granting them $28 billion in tax cuts or other
benefits.
   Democrats argued that stripping down the bill to its $13.8
billion in revenues and spending cuts for next year is the only way
to quickly pass it. Unless the measure is approved by Oct. 16 _
which until now has been considered unlikely _ the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law will automatically impose across-the-board
cuts on defense and many domestic programs.
   The Democratic proposal positioned them to blame the GOP for
forcing lengthy debate on a needlessly complex bill, thus
triggering the automatic cuts.
   ``They're putting the issue of capital gains ahead of meeting
the targets of Gramm-Rudman and delaying'' the law's spending cuts,
said Bentsen.
   Bentsen said he has offered to drop his own proposal to restore
Individual Retirement Account benefits from the bill if the capital
gains effort is also abandoned.
   Republicans, however, were unwilling to consent to the
Democratic plan unless the Democrats agreed to a Senate vote on
cutting the capital gains rate, which was a major plank in Bush's
election campaign last year.
   ``It's been part of the process from the very beginning,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``It's already passed the
House, and we believe now is the time to include it in the bill.''
   For their part, Democrats seemed reluctant to promise such a
vote. Both Bentsen and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, declined to predict whether the Senate would adopt a
capital gains cut if it came to a vote.
   The House approved its own version of the deficit-reduction bill
Thursday on a 333-91 vote, a measure that included a temporary
reduction in capital gains tax rates.
   GOP lawmakers who attended the Capitol meeting with Bush gave
differing accounts afterward of whether Bush would agree to forgo a
vote on capital gains until some other time.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Bush ``wants capital gains in
this package.'' But Sen. John Chafee, D-R.I., said if Bush was
promised a future vote, ``That's obviously something he'll have to
consider.''
   For procedural reasons, capital gains supporters would
apparently need 60 votes to prevail if the provision is part of the
deficit-reduction bill. Only 51 votes would be necessary if it was
free-standing legislation.
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments,
now are fully taxed at the same rates as other income. Under the
House-passed bill, the top rate of 33 percent would be cut to 19.6
percent until 1992, when it would be raised to 28 percent and
``indexed'' to avoid taxing gains arising solely from inflation.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., has proposed a capital gains plan
under which the longer an investment was held, the less of its
profits would be taxed when sold. He wants to substitute his
proposal for the Democratic IRA restoration.
   Packwood's plan, which failed in the Senate Finance Committee on
a 10-10 vote earlier this week, is expected to be the starting
point for whatever plan the Senate considers.

<HEAD>2,000 Mourn Death of Giamatti</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With as many laughs as tears, more than
2,000 people joined Friday in mourning the death and celebrating
the life of former Yale University president and baseball
commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti.
   The tributes to the 19th president of Yale were filled with
references to the great works of literature dear to him, to
Giamatti's own writings and speeches, and to his love for baseball.
   Giamatti, a resident of the New Haven suburb of Hamden, died
Sept. 1 after suffering a heart attack at his weekend retreat on
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. He was 51, and five months into his job as
commissioner of major league baseball.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh; Giamatti's successor as
baseball commissioner, Francis T. Vincent Jr.; National League
president Bill White and a number of elected officials joined
members of the Yale community for the memorial service.
   Giamatti was remembered by his two sons, Paul and Marcus, Yale
President Benno C. Schmidt Jr. and other friends for his wit and
wisdom and deep love of learning, his integrity, belief in the
importance of civility and his compulsion to always do what was
decent.
   Giamatti, a noted Renaissance scholar and lifelong baseball fan,
was Yale president from 1978 through June 1986. He became president
of baseball's National League shortly after leaving the university.
   ``We gather to celebrate a life lived greatly within our
walls,'' said Schmidt, the first to speak. ``We gather in grief,
grief that is sharp and sticks in our throats.''
   Moving those at the service to both tears and laughter, Marcus
Giamatti remembered his father telling him stories from Renaissance
literature at the age of 6 and teaching him baseball as a boy of
10, urging him to concentrate his forces while swinging a bat and
to ``never argue with an umpire.''
   ``Let no one say, `There are no more heroes,''' said Giamatti, a
graduate of Yale's School of Drama. ``My father is my hero. And
when I read the final paragraph of his book, ``A Free and Ordered
Space,'' I know that he is here with me _ and that he teaches me
still.''
   Deans and former deans of Yale College and the graduate and
professional schools served as ushers. Priscilla Baskerville, who
is appearing in the Metropolitan Opera production of ``Porgy and
Bess,'' sang a Giamatti favorite, ``Amazing Grace.''
   Speakers said that Giamatti considered teaching the noblest
profession, and one that he never put aside.
   ``Witness these past few months, when he became not only
commissioner of baseball but instructor extraordinary to the
American sports industry and to Pete Rose,'' said Maynard Mack, a
professor emeritus of English who was a classmate of Giamatti's
father.
   Eight days before Giamatti died, he banished Rose from baseball
for life as a result of allegations he bet on baseball games and
the Cincinnati Reds, which Rose managed.
   Major league baseball is to pay its respects to Giamatti on Oct.
31 at Carnegie Hall in New York.

<HEAD>Agents Told Of 60 Tons Cocaine, $80 Million Cash At LA Warehouse</HEAD>

charges can be brought.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The alleged manager of a Los Angeles warehouse
where raiders seized the largest cocaine haul ever told drug agents
that 60 tons of the drug passed through in the last year alone, a
prosecutor said Friday.
   James McTague also identified the leader of the drug ring as
Rafael Munoz, a Mexican who lives in Juarez, according to an
affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles and unsealed
here.
   The disclosures came during an identity and bail hearing for
Carlos Tapia Ponce and his son, Hector Tapia Anchondo, who
authorities claim ran the U.S. leg of the smuggling operation.
   U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Leavitt, citing a ``serious risk of
flight,'' ordered the Tapias held without bail pending their return
to Los Angeles to face narcotics charges. Leavitt set a preliminary
hearing Wednesday.
   McTague, married to Tapia Anchondo's sister, was identified in
the affidavit as the manager of the warehouse in Sylmar, where
authorities last week found 19 tons of cocaine and $12.2 million in
cash.
   ``He indicated that since he had been in charge they had moved
60 tons of cocaine through the warehouse,'' said Tom Green, an
assistant U.S. Attorney. ``The ledgers showed that $80 million cash
had gone through his hands since he'd been involved.''
   Green said McTague, arrested along with three others in the Los
Angeles raid, told Drug Enforcement Administration agents he was
hired a year ago to run the warehouse. The building was rented by
Tapia Ponce beginning in December 1987 for $1,700 a month.
   He said McTague told agents after his arrest they could find the
Tapias at a Las Vegas hotel, where they were vacationing with
family members.
   ``These two individuals were identified as the operators of the
organization,'' by McTague, Green said.
   An informant alerted authorities to activities at the warehouse
and surveillance began only two days before the raid, DEA special
agent James L. Capra said in the affidavit.
   Authorities initially said they found 20 tons of cocaine
estimated to have a street value of between $2 billion and $20
billion, but Green said Friday that after weighing the drugs the
final figure was about 19 tons.
   The 66-year-old Tapia Ponce, a Mexican national, admitted to
agents when arrested that he was involved in narcotics trafficking
and that he had been paid $5,000 a trip to bring 100 kilos of
cocaine over the border near El Paso several times a week, Green
said.
   Defense attorney David Chesnoff didn't ask bail for Tapia Ponce,
but argued that his son should be granted bail because he was
linked to the drug activity only by McTague's statements. A picture
of Tapia Ponce was found in the warehouse.
   Chesnoff said the 38-year-old Tapia Anchondo, a resident alien,
lives in El Paso with his wife and 2-year-old child and makes his
living on a ranch in Mexico. He described him as a college graduate
working on a masters degree in psychology.
   ``There is no record he's ever been in California or had
proprietary interest in cocaine,'' Chesnoff said.
   But Green described both men as ``the top hierarchy'' of a ring
that transported several thousand pounds of cocaine a week from El
Paso to Los Angeles in semi-trailers, then sold it at 100 to 500
pounds a deal from the warehouse.
   Green said both men probably will be charged with running a
continuing criminal enterprise, and under federal guidelines, face
a minimum of nearly 20 years in prison without possibility of
parole if convicted.
   ``They're virtually facing the rest of their lives in prison and
they have every reason to flee,'' Green said in support of bail
denial.
   In Los Angeles, meanwhile, a prosecutor dismissed drug charges
against McTague and three others to turn the four over to federal
authorities for prosecution.
   They would be jailed under a federal hold order until they could
be arraigned, probably Tuesday, said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman in
the U.S. Attorney's Office.
   Deputy District Attorney Curt Hazell, who dismissed the state
charges, said the maximum punishment under state law is 20 years in
prison, of which offenders usually serve 10. In federal court, the
four, if convicted, would face a maximum of life in prison without
the possibility of parole, he said.
   ``The federal case is as secure and as solid as ours,'' he said.

   An immigration judge ordered political
asylum for two pro-democracy Chinese students, saying they ``would
undoubtedly suffer the same fate as the martyrs of Tiananmen
Square'' if returned to China.
   The ruling, released Friday, is the first decision made public
by U.S. immigration officials stemming from the Chinese
government's crackdown on protesters in early June, which resulted
in the deaths of hundreds, possibly thousands of people in Beijing.
   The students, who are engaged to be married, took part in a
protest against the crackdown in Tokyo and fled to the United
States on Aug. 7, saying they had received threatening telephone
calls.
   ``Until China changes its policy of death, fear and terror
against dissidents, foreign students involved in the
democratization movement should not be forcibly returned to Red
China by the government of the United States,'' said Immigration
Judge Bernard Hornbach.
   ``This is a turning point in our lives,'' one of the students,
Luo Jian Guang, said in Chinese at a news conference, as
interpreted by his lawyer, Eugene Wong.
   ``I came to this country and for the first time am breathing the
air of freedom,'' Luo, 32, said.
   ``I am very happy,'' his fiancee, Hoy Yu Yi, 27, said in
English. Wong interpreted another of her statements as saying she
was taught in China that ``America is a cold and inhuman society,''
and was pleased to discover otherwise.
   Hornbach's ruling would allow the couple to seek permanent
resident status. Its legal conclusions are not binding on other
immigration judges unless it is appealed by the government and
upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
   ``We're reviewing the decision to determine what action, if any,
we're going to take,'' said David Ilchert, district director of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   Wong said the decision, if it became a precedent, could help
other Chinese students living overseas, including some 73,000 in
the United States. But he said he did not expect a wave of asylum
applications, in part because President Bush has given U.S.-based
Chinese students an additional year of protection against
deportation.
   Wong said the U.S. government had formally opposed asylum before
the hearing but did not contradict testimony by a scholar, a
journalist and others about the dangers to dissidents in China _
crucial points for Hornbach's ruling.
   The ruling contrasted with decisions by immigration judges that
have rejected all but a fraction of applications for asylum by
refugees from El Salvador and Guatemala.
   In those cases, the U.S. government has generally denied that
Central Americans face a provable danger if deported, and has
argued that they entered the United States for economic rather than
political reasons.
   Luo, an international business student, and Ms. Hoy, studying
linguistics, attended a protest rally outside the Chinese embassy
in Tokyo on June 4, the second day of the killings in and around
Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Both signed a petition that was
delivered to the embassy, and said their pictures were taken by
embassy officials.
   After the demonstration, they said they got anonymous phone
calls telling them they would face the consequences when they
returned to China.
   After arriving in the United States, both were jailed initially
and later released on $5,000 bail. They said they plan to study
English, look for work and marry soon.

   When 15-year-old Anthony Lopez dared his
captor to shoot him, he didn't think he would be taken seriously or
that the gun was real. Moments later he felt pressure in his face.
   ``I chuckled and he shot me right there,'' Lopez said from his
hospital room. ``I heard the fire and saw the sparks. It didn't
hurt.''
   Lopez wasn't the only Loara High School student held hostage
during drama class Thursday who thought the armed student was just
kidding and trying to get attention when he took over the class.
   The armed youth, identified as Cordell ``Cory'' Robb, joked
during the siege, at one point referring to himself as ``the Dirty
Harry with acne'' and offering classmates sips of his Coca-Cola.
   Then they saw Lopez get shot in the face.
   ``When he shot, blood went all over the place _ all over the
tiles and carpet,'' said Diana Rankin, 14. ``Everyone was crying
and screaming.''
   Lopez, 15, was in fair condition Friday, said Fran Tardiff,
spokeswoman at the University of California, Irvine, Medical Center.
   Friends and acquaintances said Robb, 15, was a frequent reader
of Stephen King horror novels and wasn't taken seriously because he
made threats before. He had threatened to commit suicide and take a
class hostage, they said.
   ``He said he was going to hold hostage a drama class second
period,'' said friend Faye Peterson. ``He said there were people in
the class he didn't like. I guess they bugged him.''
   Last month, a 17-year-old high school student in Kentucky held
11 of his classmates hostage in what police said was a plot
directly from King's novel, ``Rage.'' No one was injured during the
daylong standoff.
   Classmates said Robb was also fascinated with the movie
``Heathers,'' in which a troubled teen-ager named J.D. kills the
popular kids at school. The sarcastic antihero dies when he tries
to blow up his school.
   Mike Berault, 14, who described himself as Robb's best friend,
said the youth thought J.D. was ``cool.''
   Robb himself was described as anything but cool, and most
classmates saw him as an outsider.
   ``A lot of kids teased him. They made fun of him and called him
names. I guess they thought he was strange,'' said Miss Peterson.
``People called him psychopath.''
   Friends said Robb was haunted by memories of his father, Ronald
Eugene Robb. The teen said his father committed suicide.
   He also had a strained relationship with his stepfather.
   ``It was a conflict all the time,'' said Carol Sharkey, who
babysat for Robb until he was 14. ``Cory said his dad was real
strict.''
   Hostages said Robb asked a police negotiator to bring his
stepfather to the school auditorium.
   Officer Steve Stempniak was the negotiator who calmly talked the
boy into giving up. ``When I was putting the cuffs on him, I guess
it finally hit me just what could have happened,'' the 11-year
police veteran said.
   Robb was being held Friday in a juvenile facility awaiting
charges.
   Nina Sartore, 16, said she has known Robb since grammar school
and wasn't really surprised when she heard what happened.
   ``Truthfully, he's got a lot of problems. I kind of expected
something like this ... for him to flip out.'' she said. ``I tried
to help him. He didn't want the help.''

   The Soviet Union on Friday called for a
treaty giving the World Court binding authority to settle
international disputes.
   If negotiation or mediation did not succeed ``within a
reasonable period of time,'' any party to a dispute could take the
matter to arbitration, said the plan submitted by Vladimir
Petrovsky, a deputy foreign minister.
   Currently, decisions by the U.N.'s World Court at the Hague,
formally known as the International Court of Justice, are only
advisory unless a nation agrees to the court's authority in a
particular case or area of law.
   Dmitri M. Bykov, a Soviet deputy permanent U.N. representative,
told reporters the proposal ``should be a treaty, an international
agreement.''
   The proposal called for nations in dispute to open negotiations,
and ultimately ``to resort to procedures which entail binding
decisions; that is, submit the dispute, at the request of either of
the parties to it, to arbitration or judicial proceedings.
   ``In this connection ... the International Court of Justice will
be enhanced,'' says the Soviet plan.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called last December for a
comprehensive strengthening of international law.
   U.S. State Department legal officers responded to his appeal by
opening negotiations with the Soviets on various areas of
international law, but Washington has not endorsed the whole
package proposed by the Soviets.
   At a meeting last month, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III agreed both
nations should obey the World Court in cases not involving national
security.
   That would exclude cases like Nicaragua's 1986 dispute with
Washington, in which the leftist Sandinista government contended
the United States was illegally mining its harbors and supporting
the Contra rebels. The U.S. government refused to honor a World
Court ruling that sided with the Sandinistas.
   Washington accepts World Court rulings under about 60 treaties
dealing with a range of diplomatic and commercial rights.
   For 40 years, the Soviets rejected the court's authority, but
Moscow reversed its policy under Gorbachev.
   The Soviet Union said in March it will obey the court's rulings
in human rights treaties condemning genocide, banning traffic in
prostitution and other forms of slavery, guaranteeing political
rights for women, banning racism and outlawing torture.

<TEXT>
   Two Burmese students demanding
democracy in their military-ruled homeland hijacked a jetliner
carrying 83 other people but surrendered peacefully early Saturday
to Thai authorities.
   The hijackers commandeered the Burmese Fokker 28 Friday while it
was on a domestic flight from Mergui, Burma, to the capital of
Rangoon. They forced the plane to land in neighboring Thailand at
the military airport at Utaphao, 80 miles southeast of Bangkok.
   At one point the hijackers threatened to blow up the plane but
made no other threats after their deadline passed.
   They had demanded the release of political prisoners, an end to
military rule and the restoration of democracy in Burma.
   No passenger list was issued, but it was believed all aboard
were Burmese nationals because foreigners are barred from Mergui.
   The hijackers released 35 hostages Friday night and then the 48
other passengers and crew Early Saturday after negotiations with
Thai and Burmese authorities.
   Early reports had said at least one of the hijackers had a hand
gregnade and that a box possibly contained explosives, but hours
later authorities would not say if the sky pirates were armed. Thai
explosives specialists checked the plane and took away the
suspicious box for examination.
   The Burmese government rejected all of the hijackers' demands
and before the two men surrendered one gave a written statement
containing seven demands to a reporter who read the list to other
journalists gathered around the plane.
   ``I can say all are free, and the plane and passengers will go
to Burma this morning except the two hijackers who are in Thai
custody,'' Aug Gyi, a counselor at the Burmese Embassy in Bangkok
said.
   Thai government spokeman Likit Hongladarom identified the two
hijackers, as Ye Yin and Ye Thi Ha and said they wanted their
damands published by the press. He noted those names mean ``brave''
and ``lion'' and said they probably were pseudonyms.
   Thai officials gave this account of the drama:
   The Fokker landed at Utaphao at 5:40 p.m. Friday. The hijackers
released 35 hostages but threatened to destroy the plane if Burma
refused their demands.
   After further negotiations led by Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Tienchai Sirisunpan, one of the hijackers left the aircraft and had
a reporter read a handwritten statement that began ``Gentle
government, please help us.''
   But the statement also said if negotiations failed the hijackers
would kill the passengers, destroy the aircraft and commit suicide.
   After the note was read the remaining 44 passengers disembarked.
   At about 4:25 a.m. Saturday the hijackers, four crew members and
Tienchai left the plane and nine navy commandos entered the craft
to conduct a search. They removed the box that it was believed
could obtain explosives.
   Inside the plane a felt pen had been used to scribble such
slogans as, ``Our heads are bloody but unbowed'' and ``Democracy
and human rights for our people.''
   A Thai navy spokesman, Lt. Somchai Kaewvibunphan, said during
the initial negotiations one of the two men who hijacked the plane
was seen in the doorway of the aircraft holding what appeared to be
a hand grenade.
   Among the hijackers' demands were the release of opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi, an end to the curfew and a democratic
government.
   Mrs. Suu Kyi, a daughter of the late national hero Aung San, was
placed under house arrest July 20 after speeches denouncing the
government. Her National League for Democracy is the largest
opposition party in Burma.
   Burma's official news agency in a brief report said there were
three hijackers among the 81 passengers along with a pilot,
co-pilot and two flight attendants, and the sky pirates ordered the
pilot at gunpoint to fly to Thailand. Thai officials said two men
hijacked the craft.
   Burmese students were at the forefront of an uprising for
democracy in Burma last year that was crushed by the military on
Sept. 18, 1988.
   In recent months the government has intensified its crackdown on
dissident groups, and Western diplomats say that several thousand
members of opposition groups have been arrested since July.
   Thailand has attempted to establish good relations with the
military government in Rangoon and has made several deals to
exploit Burma's timber and fishery resources. These links have been
criticized by Burmese activists who want the international
community to isolate the military government.
   It was the first known hijack of a Burmese aircraft in recent
decades.
   In 1952, one of Burma's numerous rebel groups forced a pilot to
land his domestic DC-3 at gunpoint and made off with a bundle of
cash destined for government employees.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch will become a visiting
fellow at New York University's Urban Research Center after he
leaves office in January, the university announced Friday.
   Koch will give six lectures on the economic and social
challenges facing cities and the roles of state and federal
governments in urban policy, the university said.
   He also will meet informally with students and faculty.
   The appointment was announced by N.Y.U. President John Brademas
and L. Jay Oliva, the university's chancellor and executive vice
president for academic affairs.
   ``With 25 years experience in public service as a New York City
councilman, United States congressman and as mayor, Mr. Koch is
uniquely qualified to address the challenges facing the nation's
metropolitan centers,'' Brademas said.
   Koch said he would fit right in as a visiting fellow because he
thought of himself as a ``pretty good teacher,'' and urban affairs
``is an area I am familiar with.''
   Koch, a three-term mayor, lost the Democratic primary last month
to Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, who faces Republican
challenger Rudolph Giuliani in November.

   Police detained about 16,000 people in a
massive search this week for a television executive kidnapped by
gunmen thought to be leftist guerrillas, a spokesman for the
Interior Ministry said Friday.
   All but 4,000 were released after questioning, said the
spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity. About 3,000
police officers using dogs and backed by light armored cars took
part in the mass roundup.
   Hector Delgado Parker, senior news executive of Channel 5 and
former adviser to President Alan Garcia, was abducted Wednesday.
The gunmen shot up his armored-plated car, killed his driver and
badly wounded his bodyguard in the ambush, police said.
   Police said pamphlets from the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement were found at the site. Witnesses said that
up to eight kidnappers took part.

   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights on Friday
branded the title of a speech planned by its chairman as
``thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory''
   The chairman, William B. Allen, planned to give the speech on
Saturday at a symposium ``Homosexuality and Public Policy
Implications'' sponsored by the California Coalition for
Traditional Values.
   The commission said in a statement its members had not seeen the
speech and did not know what Allen planned to say, but ``based on
the commissioners' understanding that the chairman entitled his
speech, `Blacks, Animals and Homosexuals: What is a Minority,' the
commissioners distance themselves from the speech's title as
thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.''
   The statement said the members ``distance themselves from the
chairman's participation in the symposium because the commission
does not possess jurisdiction to discuss issues involving
homosexuality, except in the context of the administration of
justice. Accordingly, the commission has no position on the issue.''
   The statement was approved by a 6-1 vote, with Allen the
dissenter. Blandina Cardenas Ramirez did not take part, the
commission said.
   The coalition opposes extension of civil rights protection to
homosexuals, and believes homosexuality is learned behavior that
can be changed. The session at which Allen is to speak is entitled
``Homosexuality and Public Policy Implications.''
   The first day's sessions of the symposium were held Friday at a
hotel in Anaheim, Calif. Allen's plans to speak there attracted
criticism from homosexual groups earlier this week.
   In an interview with The Washington Post published Wednesday.
Allen said: ``It's always appropriate to talk about civil rights
and to help people understand the promise of this nation. I can't
imagine why there would be any question about it.''
   There was no answer at a telephone listed in his name Friday
evening in Claremont, Calif., where he is a professor at Harvey
Mudd College.

<TEXT>
   Project ELF, the Navy's $400-million web
of antennas allowing communication with submerged submarines
worldwide, went into operation Friday after more than a quarter
century of planning, protests and revisions.
   ELF, which stands for Extremely Low Frequency transmission, has
been tested for two years at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base near
Marquette. Full power testing began in May.
   Ten years ago, ELF was envisioned as an underground grid of
about 2,000 square miles designed to survive an enemy bomb.
   The Navy later said even such a grid would be unlikely to
survive a nuclear attack. Today's unit resembles a utility power
line.
   Ceremonies at Sawyer Friday commemorated the system coming on
line, and gave it a new name: the Naval Communications Unit,
Marquette. The unit will work with a similar facility in Clam Lake,
Wis.
   Some of the more than 60 environmental and health tests that
have been conducted will continue, including monitoring of the four
``Mouse Motel'' compounds where mice have been living with no
apparent harm from the transmissions.
   Woodpeckers occasionally drill holes in the 1,492 pine poles
holding the transmission cables, and the Navy has replaced poles as
necessary.
   The state Department of Natural Resources, which has shadowed
development of ELF, said the project has proceeded smoothly despite
some environmental protests over the years.
   Navy spokeswoman Lt. Maureen Cahill said 30 military and about
50 civilians will be employed on Project ELF.

   A state trooper was convicted Thursday
of rape and sodomy in an attack on a motorist he pulled over for a
traffic ticket.
   Robert O. Bennett Jr., a state police officer for eight years,
was found guilty of rape, two counts of sodomy, sexual abuse,
first-degree coercion, unlawful imprisonment and official
misconduct.
   Bennett, 36, who is from Halfmoon, was charged with attacking
the woman after he pulled her over on Interstate 87 in upstate New
York.
   The woman testified last week that Bennett stopped her on Sept.
10, 1988, for an improper lane change and erratic driving and later
took her to a wooded area and raped her.
   The woman said she kept the attack secret until days later when
she called a Rape Crisis hotline in her hometown of Ithaca.
   Bennett was arrested and suspended in January after the woman
identified him from his name tag and the photographs of his cruiser.
   During his closing statement, Assistant District Attorney Thomas
McNamara said the victim, a 29-year-old college professor,
``entered a `Twilight Zone' of fear and trauma and intimidation''
at the hands of Bennett.
   Stephen Coffey, Bennett's attorney, said he would seek to have
Bennett released on bail pending an appeal.
   Judge Frank Williams scheduled sentencing for Dec. 4. Bennett
faces 8 1-3 to 25 years imprisonment.

   A typhoon has killed 31 people and injured 493
others on an island off China's southeast coast, the official news
agency said Thursday.
   Xinhua said Typhoon Brian hit Hainan Island on Monday night and
caused severe flooding and damage to homes, roads and
communications lines. It did not say if the downed lines were the
reason for the delay in announcing the deaths.
   Hainan, south of Hong Kong, became China's newest province last
year and has been marked for rapid economic development. However,
its infrastructure remains weak and farming is still the main
occupation of most residents.
   Hundreds of people died in two typhoons that struck further
north on China's coast earlier this year. Authorities said last

   A single-engine plane crashed short

killing all four people on board, an airport official said.
   The Piper Arrow was coming in for a landing in clear weather

the runway, said airport Director of Aviation Allen Smoot. No one
on the ground was injured.
   ``There was some turbulence,'' said Val Lanese. ``I could see it
was in trouble. The left wing was straight up in the air and it
crashed onto its right wing.''
   The identities of the victims and cause of the crash were not
immediately known. The Federal Aviation Administration and the
Riverside County coroner were investigating.
   Smoot said the crash closed the airport briefly, but no
commercial flights were delayed in this desert resort 100 miles

   The artist Christo's plan to erect 1,700
giant yellow umbrellas in the hills of Southern California is on
schedule, with all the needed permits obtained, a spokesman said
Thursday.
   The outdoor artwork Christo proposes to erect near the mountain
community of Gorman, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles, is half
of a trans-Pacific project envisioned by the 54-year-old Bulgarian
artist.
   ``Everything is still on line, the schedule date is there,''
said Thomas M. Golden, U.S. project director for the undertaking
Christo has described as ``a symphony in two parts.''
   Christo creates transitory landscapes of unexpected colors and
materials to achieve what he calls ``a gentle disturbance'' of the
mind.
   He previously has wrapped the oldest bridge in Paris in
champagne-colored fabric, surrounded 11 islands in Florida's
Biscayne Bay with shocking pink polypropylene and erected a
transluscent ``Running Fence'' across Northern California.
   The two movements of Christo's umbrella symphony are to begin
simultaneously in October 1991 in California and Japan _ places
Christo selected for their geographical and cultural contrasts.
   As autumn burns the rumpled hills of Southern California to
golden hues, some 1,700 yellow umbrellas _ each 28 feet in diameter
_ will blossom like California poppies along the Tejon Pass.
   At the same time, about 1,300 identical blue umbrellas will open
in the lush bamboo forest, rice paddies, crowded villages and farms
of Japan's Ibaraki province, about 70 miles north of Tokyo.
   In both countries, the umbrellas will stay up only for about
three weeks.
   Although all the permits for the California project have been
gathered, many details remain to be worked out with the Japanese,
Golden said in a telephone interview from his office in Freestone,
Calif.
   ``We keep going back so they know you are sincere in pursuing
this,'' Golden said. ``It's entirely different. They don't have
public hearings and they don't have agencies that issue
encroachment permits, for example.''
   In Japan, there are about 435 landowners, and Golden said in at
least one instance the umbrella's 28-foot diameter is wider than
the parcel of land where it will be erected.
   In contrast, Christo has obtained permission to erect his
umbrellas from a total of 23 landowners in California, including
two governmental agencies, Golden said.
   The California Highway Patrol expects a bit more than gentle
disturbance from the project.
   ``I can imagine freeway commuter traffic, almost
bumper-to-bumper on weekends,'' said Capt. Patrick Harrington, head
of the California Highway Patrol's legislative unit in Sacramento.
   ``I told that to Christo at one of our meetings, and and he was
quite taken aback, and he said, `No! Not really?' ... But I just
know it's going to be really heavy traffic.''

   Jim Bakker maintained his innocence and
said he was ``sad but encouraged in God'' after a jury found the
PTL founder guilty of using his television ministry to bilk

   ``I went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying I was

posting bond Thursday. ``I come out still innocent of the charges

   But the jury foreman said money corrupted Bakker, who
prosecutors said took $3.7 million in ministry funds and spent it
on vacation homes, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes cars and unusual
luxuries like an air-conditioned doghouse.
   ``He was called by God. But eventually the money became too much
for him,'' said Ricky Hill, who said during jury selection that he
was a Christian. ``We kept looking for something from the defense
and we never saw it.''

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is bracing

   Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, in a move
that appears to contradict his sworn congressional testimony, urged
an aide to arrange funding for a New York project backed by another
federal official, agency records show.
   Pierce's actions, detailed in Department of Housing and Urban
Development files released Thursday, suggest that at least on this
occasion, Pierce took a more active role than he has acknowledged
in helping those who sought his aid.
   In a handwritten instruction to top aide Deborah Gore Dean,
Pierce asked her to ``check into this and try to get it through.''
   The documents also show that then-Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger wrote Pierce to back a development seeking HUD
financing. On another occasion, records show that Carla Hills,
herself a former HUD secretary and now the Bush administration's
top trade official, got Pierce to overrule deputies in favor of her
clients.
   Pierce's attorney, Paul L. Perito, said that Pierce ``has never
asked anyone to deviate from responsible, professional government

   Most Americans consider higher education ``a
very worthwhile investment'' but few give colleges high marks for
producing quality teachers, productive workers or good citizens, a
Gallup Poll shows today.
   The national survey, released by the Council for Advancement and
Support of Education as part of National Higher Education Week,
also found that the American public is divided over whether a
person's race makes it harder to get a college degree.
   Colleges and universities received satisfactory grades for their
overall performance, with 74 percent of the 1,253 adults surveyed
in July saying that a person's lifetime benefits from attending
college are at least equal to the cost.
   Thirty-nine percent said a college education is worth more than
the cost, while 35 percent said it is equal to what is paid, the
poll showed. Slightly more than one in five, 22 percent, said a
college education today is not worth what it costs to attend.

   On a flat plot beside flowering trees lie the
graves of four people, including an 8-year-old girl, gunned down
almost simultaneously in two cities. Police believe they were
victims of a radical polygamous group's legacy of revenge, or
``blood atonement.''
   Jennifer Chynoweth's headstone reads, ``Let the Little Ones Come
Unto Me.'' Nearby are the resting places of her father, her uncle
and another man, all of whom left the Church of the Lamb of God.
   Around 4 p.m. on June 27, 1988, the four were shot
execution-style at three locations in Houston and Irving, a Dallas
suburb. More than 15 months later, police have found neither the
murder weapons nor the killers.
   ``We still have insufficient evidence to file any charges,''
said Houston homicide Lt. Richard Holland.
   Still, authorities think they know where to look. They're
investigating followers of the sect's late leader Ervil LeBaron.
   Some former sect members fear that before he died, LeBaron
targeted a number of people for death, primarily for being
unfaithful to his preachings.
   Authorities already were studying the murders and disappearances
of former LeBaron followers _ as many as 22 victims in several
states _ when the Texans were killed.
   Houston police discovered the body of Mark Chynoweth, 36, at his
Houston appliance store. He had been shot several times in the head.
   Several miles away, his brother, Duane Chynoweth, 31, and
Duane's daughter, Jennifer, were gunned down in the driveway of a
vacant home. Chynoweth had gone there to deliver a washing machine,
but a call made earlier to his brother's store asking for the
appliance apparently was a ruse.
   The vacant home's address sent an eerie message itself. It was
on Rena Street. Duane and Mark's sister Rena once was one of
LeBaron's wives, but like her brothers, left the Church of the Lamb
of God.
   The fourth victim, 32-year-old Eddie Marston, was a stepson of
LeBaron. He was found dead in the driveway of a vacant home in
Irving. He had been called there to pick up a washer and dryer,
apparently another deadly ploy.
   His girlfriend had received a frantic call from former group
members in Houston after the Chynoweths were killed, but too late.
   All three men had abandoned the LeBaron sect, which believes in
``blood atonement.''
   LeBaron organized the Church of the Lamb of God in 1971 in
Mexico. It is one of many groups that advocate a return to
polygamy, which was taught by Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon
Church, but banned by that church in 1890.
   LeBaron died in 1981 of a heart attack while serving a sentence
in Utah for the 1977 murder of rival polygamist leader Rulin Allred.
   Marston and Mark Chynoweth were acquitted in Allred's slaying.
Marston also was acquitted in the 1975 slaying of another
polygamist leader.
   Authorities believe LeBaron's followers are responsible for
killing at least 22 people over the past two decades in several
states.
   Lillian Chynoweth, Mark's wife and Ervil's daughter, once told
The Salt Lake Tribune that she was worried her father had left a
``Book of New Covenants,'' which his sons were using as a blueprint
for vengeance.
   She said the writings included a ``list of people my father
thought needed to be killed.'' Lillian fatally shot herself several
months after her husband's death and is buried beside him.
   Although Houston police haven't seen such a ``hit list,'' they
believe one may exist that includes the names of the three men
slain.
   Although the LeBaron clan has suffered setbacks, recent
developments show it is still functioning. Six of Ervil LeBaron's
younger children _ ages 12 to 18 _ disappeared on Sept. 30 from
foster homes in Salt Lake City, and authorities said they may have
headed for a hideout in Mexico.
   Police believe Andrew LeBaron, 29, may have organized the
escape, which came as other clan members who had abandoned the
Church of the Lamb of God were seeking to adopt the children.
   Glenn Chynoweth, Rena's brother, said the disappearances
thwarted efforts to turn the younger ones away from the patriarch's
violent message, ``to break that chain.''
   Several members of the LeBaron group have been sought for
questioning about the Texas murders, and some members are being
held in Phoenix and Chicago on unrelated charges.
   In August, five LeBaron followers were sentenced to prison in
Phoenix for stealing trucks. They include Heber LeBaron, 25, and
Douglas Lee Barlow, 28.
   Heber LeBaron, another of Ervil's sons, also faces charges of
robbing a savings and loan in Richardson, Texas. Barlow is wanted
in Houston on a vehicle burglary charge.
   Harris County Assistant District Attorney Terry Wilson said
authorities are seeking to extradite Barlow, but not until Arizona
officials are through with appeals in the truck-theft case.
   ``At this point we're not doing anything to bring someone here''
for questioning in the killings, Wilson said
   Holland said police haven't found the weapons used to kill
Marston and the Chynoweths.
   He would not say if any threats have been made against other
former LeBaron members, or if any of them are still under police
protection as they were for a while after the killings.
   At the funeral of the four victims, bomb-sniffing dogs and armed
police guarded grieving relatives and friends.

   Ten farm and church organizations have joined
together to help educate Americans about the importance of farm and
trade policy to the Third World.
   ``We all need to make these vital connections between our food,
farmers and trade policy,'' says program chairman Walter Grazer of
the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``Education of our citizens is
critical, so they can make informed decisions and join in the
policy process.''
   The non-profit, Washington-based Trade and Development Program
is funded by a grant from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.
   The goals of the program include ``maintaining U.S. family
farmers and vital rural communities,'' which organizers said are
important resources throughout the world.
   The sponsors are: Bread for the World Institute on Hunger and
Development, the Center for Rural Affairs, the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, the Friends Committee on National Legislation
Educational Fund, the National Catholic Rural Life Conference, the
National Farmers Organization, the National Farmers Union, the
National Grange, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the U.S.
Catholic Conference.

   A joint commission of Lutheran and Roman
Catholic theologians will focus on Scripture and tradition in the
next round of ecumenical dialogues.
   The teams of 10 Catholic and 10 Lutheran theologians decided on
the next topic while wrapping up six years of work on ``The One
Mediator, the Saints and Mary.''
   The eighth statement of the dialogue, scheduled to be voted on
in February, deals with the two traditions' differences regarding
the practice of involving saints in prayer and the doctrine that
Mary was conceived free of original sin and taken bodily to heaven.
   Catholic Archbishop Francis Stafford of Denver, co-chairman of
the dialogue, said the new topic is ``a natural development from
this round, in which there are many explicit references to the
relation between Scripture and tradition.''
   The ecumenical commission will celebrate the 25th anniversary of
the dialogues next September in Erlanger, Ky.

   A federal tax collector praised high ethical
standards set by the Evangelical Council for Financial
Accountability but warned that violations by some fund-raisers may
prompt legislation affecting all charities.
   ``Know the rules, educate your donors, make necessary changes in
your practices, and view the requirements as an ethical
obligation,'' Robert I. Brauer, an assistant commissioner of the
Internal Revenue Service, told a recent conference marking the
council's 10th anniversary. ``Don't force us at the IRS to have to
report to Congress that there is a problem and remedial legislation
may be needed.''
   Brauer said the IRS is scrutinizing tour activities designed to
benefit profit-making travel companies and promoters.

   United Methodist policy makers may be
slightly more liberal than the average clergy and the lay members
in the nation's second largest Protestant denomination, according
to a new study.
   United Methodist leaders were defined as ministers and
laypersons who were elected as delegates to the United Methodist
General Conference in 1988. The General Conference, which meets
every four years, has final authority in all matters in the 9
million-member denomination.
   On a scale of one to five, with one being the most liberal and
five the most conservative, the average clergy delegate rated
himself 2.7 on social issues, while the lay delegates rated
themselves at about 3. The clergy at large had a 3 rating, while
the laity at large was rated at 3.3.
   A total of 616 clergy and lay delegates to the General
Conference responded to the mail poll. In the same period, 6,048
randomly selected clergy who were not delegates responded to a
similar mail poll, and 526 randomly selected lay people answered
telephone interviews.

<HEAD>Party's Ending for W.Va. Party Line Customers</HEAD>

   The party line helped make great friends
and great enemies and once even helped derail a presidential
campaign.
   Now, for rural telephone customers in West Virginia, the party's
over. Reflecting a national trend, the Chesapeake &amp; Potomac
Telephone Co. is hanging up its party lines after stringing them
throughout the countryside for the first six decades of this
century.
   ``The 16-party line service was basically used as an intercom.
One person would call somebody else on the line and everybody would
pick up,'' said Kenneth Pitt, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, C&amp;P's
parent company.
   ``The housewives would get on there and talk for two hours or
maybe three hours. It was a different day and age. Those days are
gone.''
   There was a time, however, when telephone company workers like
Sonny Stroud climbed mountains, crossed rivers and dug trenches to
set up the party lines.
   ``Just being able to provide service, even on a party line, just
thrilled us then,'' said Stroud of Rainelle, who took a C&amp;P job in
1948. ``We'd do anything to get the system to whoever wanted it.''
   Phone service first came to southeast West Virginia in 1904, the
majority of it through party lines. One-tenth of West Virginia's
telephone customers were on party lines on Nov. 1, 1985, when the
Public Service Commission approved a C&amp;P request to eliminate that
service.
   ``It's considered a lesser quality of service _ like driving the
battered pickup truck versus driving a shiny new one with velour
seats,'' explained Pitt in an interview from his office in
Arlington, Va. ``It isn't even seen as telephone service.''
   Talcott residents made their last party line calls this summer.
When a handful of Eastern Panhandle residents are switched over
soon, all of C&amp;P's 635,000 West Virginia customers will be on
private lines.
   One customer who's happy about that is Jim Monroe Jr. of
Greenbrier Nurseries, which was on a party line for 31 years _ ``a
terrible inconvenience.''
   ``Most of the time we had it, we had only one other person on
it. There was this family up at Barger Springs, they were a Greek
family that barely spoke English, so they barely made phone calls.
   ``But then there once was another woman who spread gossip around
and was on the phone all the time.''
   The business now plans to install a toll-free 800 number,
something not possible on a party line.
   Around the nation, 2.8 million people remained on party lines at
the end of 1987, the latest year for which figures were available,
according to the United States Telephone Association. In 1985,
there were 4.6 million party lines.
   The Rural Electrification Administration in Washington, which
lends money to rural telephone companies that serve 5 million
people, still will handle requests from 4-party line systems.
   But, said Fred Albrecht, an REA telecommunications specialist,
``I don't know of one made in the last 10 years.''
   ``We discourage them. In today's age, you can build a 1-party
plant as cheaply as a 4-party plant.''
   Although party lines sometimes promoted neighborliness, they
sometimes did the opposite.
   Eight families were on a line operated by a Missouri company
Albrecht once worked for _ and one of the families had eight
children, another nine.
   ``One day, the other six people on the line all showed up at my
office to complain that they couldn't get to the phone. We put the
other six on one line and put the families with the 17 kids on the
other.''
   When the two big families continued to complain, he said, ``We
told them they would have to work it out.''
   It wasn't unusual to have even more people on the line, said Jim
Davis, an external affairs manager for C&amp;P, recalling one copper
line that had five 10-party lines. ``It was so hot they had to use
gloves to handle it.''
   Nowadays, thousands of calls can be routed simultaneously on
fiberoptic cables. A standard cable with 12 pairs of lines can
handle hundreds of customers as computerized equipment switches
from line to line thousands of times per second and sends voice and
data impulses _ clean and crisp.
   Even though private-line service will add a little more than $4
to the roughly $17 monthly phone bill for the average family
formerly on a party line, customers like Sara Sowers are not
complaining.
   ``It's better this way. You can go to the phone and just pick it
up,'' she said. ``Before, you had to pick it up to see if anyone
was on it. Then you would pick it up a little later and they'd
still be on there. You just had to keep picking it up.''
   And sometimes you had to put it down, too _ as the late Hubert
Humphrey learned during West Virginia's Democratic presidential
primary race in 1960.
   Two days before the vote, Humphrey held a slight lead over John
F. Kennedy in the polls and purchased a half-hour of television
time for a statewide call-in show.
   Theodore H. White, in ``The Making of the President, 1960,''
wrote that Humphrey already was flustered by callers straying from
the topics when a voice interrupted a party line calling, ``Clear
the wires! This is an emergency!''
   ``Humphrey attempted to explain they were on the air, they were
answering questions to a TV audience,'' White wrote. The voice
again ordered Humphrey and his caller to surrender the line, and
the candidate, ``his face blank and bedazzled, hung up, shaken, to
press the button for another call.''
   Kennedy won the primary and the presidency.

<HEAD>Lenny Kravitz Is Not Mr. Bonet</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Name-dropping is a favorite pastime in the
entertainment business, and musician Lenny Kravitz has a few at his
disposal.
   There's his wife, actress Lisa Bonet of NBC's ``A Different
World''; his mother, Roxie Roker, who pla in the
long-running TV sit-com ``The Jeffersons''; and his father, Sy
Kravitz, a former NBC executive.
   But the younger Kravitz, who also goes by the name Romeo Blue,
prefers discussing a few well-placed strangers, such as John
Lenyed Helen Willisnon, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley and Lou Reed, all influences
for
his debut album, ``Let Love Rule.''
   ``I'm not hip on the way records sound today,'' the 25-year-old
Kravitz said, ``all this digital and sampling everywhere.
   ``My record sounds like the kind you just drop a needle on and
play. I grew up on records that sound like this. I don't think
records sound any better than in the late '50s or early '60s.''
   He makes his point on the record's opening track, ``Sitting on
Top of the World,'' proudly performed a little off-key, his voice
cracking early in the song.
   ``I dreamed the whole song,'' he said, ``and I hummed it into
the tape recorder. I did that one live, in one take, with just
guitar and mike.until now, I think
I turned down about eight record deals.'' he said. ``They wanted
trendy black music, which I hate. `This is too white. You have to
get your black base first, then you can cross over. Everybody has
to. Go get yourself a drum machine and make yourself a funk record.'
   ``That was a big issue. But what I'm doing is black music
anyway, rhythm and blues, rock 'n' roll. People think if you don't
sound like Bobby Brown, it's not black music.''
   He spent time in the studio, recording songs meant for his ears
only, when a friend heard a tape and passed the word around that a
promising new star was waiting to be discovered. After meeting and
falling in love with Bonet, Kravitz was an even hotter property.
   ``Being that I was married to her, people were interested in
what I was doing. I was on the cover of all these magazines, just
because I was married to her. `Who is this guy?'''
   Bonet not only brought him much-needed publicity, but helped
Kravitz find himself as a musician.
   ``When I first met Lisa, I was a studio musician, but I still
didn't know what to do, because I played funk, rock, jazz, whatever
and could play all sorts of instruments,'' said Kravitz, who plays
all the instruments on ``Let Love Rule.''
   ``We're so similar. I saw myself in her, a reflection of myself.
All of a sudden I knew what I had to. After she was finished with
her show, I started writing and cutting. I came to New York and
booked myself in a studio. My writing come back and I started
building up these tunes.''
   Kravitz's nasal vocals on ``Let Love Rule'' and ``Be'' recall
Lennon and Elvis Costello, and ``Mr. Cab Driver,'' an angry talking
blues, has the man-on-the-street feel of Reed's best known songs.
   ``I got `The Best of Lou Reed.' and `Walk on the Wild Side' just
blew my mind. I fell in love with that Lower East Side, New York
sound, getting that message over. But I don't think about doing a
Lou Reed-sounding record, certain sounds just come out of me.''
   He vows to include other musicians on his next record and is
touring with a 10-piece band. Kravitz hopes to win over fans who
know him only for the names he can drop.
   ``What if I came out to see you because your wife is so-and-so?
If that's what brings people out, fine,'' he said. ``But I've got
something to say, I'm not interested in being Mr. Bonet.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest news from Linda Ellerbee's end of
life's great parade, other than that she doesn't want to host a
talk show, is this:
   _ Her Lucky Duck Productions has just finished its first
documentary, a one-hour ``Smithsonian World'' course on the history
of food in America. It is tentatively called ``Moveable Feast.''
   _ The show, heading for a PBS date in February, is written,
reported and anchored by Lloyd Dobyns, her partner from two
sardonic, acclaimed NBC News series of yesteryear, ``Weekend'' and
``NBC News Overnight.''
   _ She isn't involved in ``Moveable Feast,'' she says, ``other
than to annoy Lloyd from time to time.''
   ``I recused myself,'' she explains, savoring the word recused,
``because of my General Foods connection, although there's nothing
in the documentary having to do with General Foods.'' The
connection is the Maxwell House coffee commercials she taped last
spring, a deed for which critics roasted her.
   _ She has not, as was implied in a recent published report, been
approached by NBC News to be a temporary co-anchor at ``Sunday
Today'' when co-anchor Maria Shriver takes a six-week maternity
leave starting Nov. 15.
   NBC, which she left in 1985, hasn't asked her, Ellerbee says.
``It's all news to me,'' she says of the report, adding that no
network has talked to her about a job, including ABC, which she
left in 1987 after her ``Our World'' was axed.
   Ellerbee also is back doing her CNN commentaries after a summer
in which she lost, she reckons, 26 pounds through a strict regimen.
She disclosed all this in an interview.
   Queries included whether she will do more of those still-running
Maxwell House commercials. ``I don't know,'' she replied to that
one.
   To those who say she sold her journalistic credibility for a
mess of instant-coffee money, she would say, and did, that ``people
can think what they want. I had good reasons to do it, and if the
circumstances were the same, I'd do it again.''
   She and Rolfe Tessem, her production partner, explained that
starting her company required a healthy infusion of cash. The
Maxwell House money _ they declined to say how much it was _ seemed
the best way to do this and retain control they might have lost
with other means of financing, they say.
   Being the host of a syndicated talk show might have provided the
money, she says, but, ``I did not want to do a talk show. I feel
they cloud the line between news and entertainment far more than a
commercial does. There's no clouding with a commercial.''
   Having gotten Lucky Duck's first show on the road, so to speak,
she and Tessem say they have other journalistic projects in the
discussion stages on three fronts _ cable, syndication and public
television.
   They decline to elaborate on these efforts, citing the
possibility of concept-poaching by others. But she doesn't rule out
working on-air again with Doybns, who left NBC, now lives near
Raleigh, N.C., and still is her pal.
   ``It's possible,'' she says. ``I do get along with the man, and
there are few enough who do.''
   Ellerbee, as some may have noticed, is a woman of many opinions,
all strong. When asked for a thought on the state of television
nowadays, she immediately gave this one:
   ``The more I see the re-creations of the news and read about the
stagings of the news, the more clean I feel about that commercial.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BACK TO THE PAST _ CBS News' Bob Simon and his crew recently
were in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, a hub of secret and
not-so-secret activity during the Vietnam War but rarely visited
now by network crews. Simon, a source says, taped reports that
include one about sad, deadly leftovers of the Vietnam War _
unexploded anti-personnel bombs called cluster-bomb units.
Missionaries he interviewed, the source says, say the bomblets now
occasionally maim or kill Laotian peasants on Laos' Plain of Jars,
an old battlefield.
   FORMER FIRST LADY TALKS _ ``Good Morning America'' co-anchor
Charles Gibson is in Los Angeles today and Tuesday, interviewing
Nancy Reagan about her new book of memoirs, ``My Turn,'' and
reports of such matters as astrology and what influence she had on
President Reagan's administration. The interview will air in five
parts on the ABC show the week of Oct. 31-Nov. 3.
   BUT FIRST, THIS IS TODAY _ Bryant Gumbel, co-anchor of NBC's
fuss festival, ``Today,'' won't be on the show today, a spokeswoman
says. But there is no significance to this. He is just taking the
day off, she says. Jane Pauley, who took a day off last week, will
co-anchor today's ``Today'' with Gumbel's fill-in, Deborah
Norville, the show's new news anchor.

<HEAD>Firm Seeks Control of Personal Computer's Life-Cycle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</HEAD>

   Imagine one company owning a rental car
business, a fleet of taxis, a chain of used car dealerships and an
auto parts company. The firms all supply each other, working
together to control a car's life cycle.
   That is what the ambitious Dan Bayha, 45-year-old president of
BATA Group in Morristown, N.J., wants to do in the world of
microcomputers.
   BATA controls a group of subsidiaries that concentrate on a
computer's afterlife:
   PSX Inc. buys from retail chains computers that have been traded
in, and refurbishes them for resale, mostly to rental companies.
For units too outdated or damaged, PSX scavenges parts.
   Personal Computer Rentals, in which BATA acquired a controlling
interest in May, is a rental franchise with 43 stores nationwide.
The franchise group is PSX's largest customer.
   BATA Capital finances equipment leased by corporations directly,
or provided via lease by Personal Computer Rentals.
   BATA is focusing its attention on what Bayha and others in the
industry see as a new growth front in the personal computer world:
rentals. Bayha said he hopes to more than double Personal Computer
Rentals' stores in two years.
   BATA, a name formed by Bayha and the last name of his partner,
Steve Tafaro, started 10 years ago as an IBM mainframe leasing
firm. A change in the tax laws in 1986 made it less advantageous
for companies to lease mainframes, Bayha said, so the firm turned
to microcomputers 2{ years ago.
   Each step of the business took them further. It was natural to
look at maintaining microcomputers as a leasing company, which led
to the idea of refurbishing and selling them used. They found that
rental firms were buying many of the retooled computers, so BATA
bought a controlling interest in Personal Computer Rentals.
   ``We kept bumping into things and said, `Gee, look at that,'''
Bayha said.
   With revenues of $15 million in 1988, not including the leasing
and rental business, BATA Group has not turned a profit, but that
should change this year, he said.
   ``It's not going to be unreasonable to believe that every home
will have two or three microcomputers just as they have two to
three televisions,'' he said.
   The personal computer market next year is expected to approach
$40 billion, with up to 15 million computers sold, said analyst Kim
Brown, at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Hundreds of small
companies either broker or rent computers.
   Brown was skeptical about the chances that a company like BATA
could make it.
   Computer technology advances so quickly, and prices drop so
dramatically that purchasers may prefer to keep on buying new
equipment, said Brown.
   For instance, an IBM PC with a color screen and 640 kilobytes of
memory cost from $4,000 to $5,000 when introduced in 1982, and is
now worth in the $200 range. IBM and Apple are expected to
introduce low-end PCs for under $1,000 within a year, he said.
   The costs of refurbishment and handling might also make the
endeavor less profitable, said Brown. ``I'm not saying it can't be
done,'' he added.
   ``There's an awful lot of companies out there that don't have to
have the latest technology,'' countered Bayha. Potential users in
homes, small businesses and lower education don't necessarily need
``high horsepower'' computers, he said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Pierre Cardin brings the first Russian rock
musical to New York in January, he expects sparks to fly.
   ``Sparks of love, that is,'' says the French
couturier-entrepreneur-theater producer.
   Cardin feels like something between Cupid and a diplomat for
having arranged a month-long engagement of the rock show ``Juno and
Avos'' at New York's City Center.
   In an interview at Maxim's, the Belle Epoque gastronomic
monument Cardin bought nine years ago, he bubbled like champagne
over his plans.
   ``Avos roughly means `a kind of hope,''' he said. And hope is
what he exudes for his ``mission'' to put on the unique musical
love story for the Americans.
   Cardin first brought the play to his Espace Cardin theater in
Paris in 1983. It might not be another ``Les Miserables,'' but the
French loved it. And the romantic scenario is particularly fitting
for today's burgeoning Soviet-American flirtation.
   The rock opera was written in 1980 by dissident Soviet poet
Andrei Vosnesensky. It is based on the true tale of a Russian sea
captain's love affair with the daughter of the Spanish governor of
San Francisco, circa 1800. It has a kind of Romeo-Juliet twist: The
couple can't marry because of religious differences; she is Roman
Catholic, he is Orthodox.
   ``It was kind of an allegorical cry for more mutual U.S.-Soviet
understanding,'' said Cardin, who is a good friend of the poet.
``Fortunately, things are going just that way.''
   Despite Vosnesensky's fears, Cardin insisted he could succeed in
getting the rock opera to Paris and even the United States. Thanks
to glasnost _ the new Soviet policy of openness _ and pulling some
strings with officials in both countries, he's making his dream
come true.
   ``Problems were not really political or cultural,'' Cardin said.
   ``The American unions are very sticky about all-foreign
productions. But I did it. The whole Russian cast and crew of 86
will be there. This is a great moment. Americans have seen Russian
ballet, folklore and the circus. But they've never seen anything
like this.''
   Long a fan of the Russian people and culture, Cardin has
manufactured and sold ready-to-wear clothing at luxury shops there
since 1986. He first heard about Vosnesensky's musical during an
earlier business visit.
   ``But it was only playing in repertory, and not the night I was
there. So they took the entire company out to a provincial town and
put it on for me and the townspeople.''
   He decided nothing would get in the way of his producing the
show at his Paris theater, known since it opened in 1970 for
everything from ballets starring Maia Plissetskaya to the American
avant-garde group Pilobus.
   Red tape of getting the big show to Paris was a mere trifle
compared to his worst moment _ opening night.
   ``Just as my show was opening in November 1983, the Soviets blew
up that KAL civilian plane over Kamchatka,'' Cardin said, and the
show itself almost bombed. ``Everyone told me I was out of my mind.
In fact, the first night the theater was almost empty. After all,
it wasn't the artists' fault. I went ahead.''
   Finally, the show was a hit, even though the new rock sound,
synthesizers and all, was astonishing for an old-fashioned love
story. Critics were flabbergasted to see the Virgin of Kazan _ a
prime chorus figure played by a bearded counter-tenor _ changing
his voice from baritone to the seraphic notes of the virgin.
   Difficulties have never bothered Cardin, who regularly flies
around the world to visit his factories and sell his goods, whether
couture, underwear or Maxim's champagne.
   ``My whole career is based on the impossible,'' he said. ``My
ready-to-wear wouldn't work, they told me more than 30 years ago.
Then all the other couturiers started copying that idea. I was told
I was quite mad to start factories in Russia and China.'' But they
flourished.
   ``Critics made the same comments about taking Maxim's all over
the world,'' he said. The Peking Maxim's was a big hit from the
time it opened six years ago, though it had to close after the
Tiananmen Square events last summer. It will open again within
weeks.
   Russophile Cardin will see his newest Maxim's open in the Soviet
Union next year, in spite of a few headaches.
   Meanwhile, Cardin is off to some of his worldwide enterprises in
China and Australia, ending up in New York on Friday to promote the
Russian musical, a production that's intially costing him ``the
eyes right out of my head,'' as the French expression goes.
   ``But money is never any concern of mine,'' he said. ``I just
want to see more mutual Russian-American understanding. It's
already miraculous, and I don't think Americans know enough about
the Russians. I think this should help.''

   Henry Goldrich is the guy who told Harry Chapin
that ``Taxi'' ran too long to be a hit. He's also the guy who
kicked George Benson out of his store because of that annoying
guitar.
   ``Back in the '60s, I told Paul (Simon) that Simon and Garfunkel
was a lousy name. And I still think it is,'' says Goldrich.
   Fortunately, musicians want instruments and not advice from
Goldrich _ which is why his music store, Manny's on West 48th
Street, has served everyone from Dizzy Gillespie to Guns N' Roses
in the past five decades.
   The Beatles invaded Manny's before they did the rest of country;
these days, Sean Lennon buys his guitars there. Mick Jagger was
looking for the right ax for this year's Stones' tour when he ran
into Bo Diddley. David Johansen has been a customer since he was a
New York Doll; he visits now as Buster Poindexter.
   ``The Who _ when they were in town, doing the show _ they were
in here. Except Daltrey. He bought a guitar once and never played
it,'' says Goldrich, dropping names as fast as Clapton works a fret
board. ``They came to my son's bar mitzvah; flew over. They're
friends.''
   Goldrich, a gray-haired, bearded man with a slight pot belly, is
the son of the original Manny and current keeper of the family
business. His dad established the store in Harlem 54 years ago, and
they became a 48th Street fixture in the late 1940s. The musicians
followed and never left.
   ``It's word of mouth. We have a very long and great
reputation,'' says Goldrich, whose earliest recollections of the
store involve a nodding John Coltrane asleep on an upstairs couch.
   Manny's customer list reads like a history of American music:
Charlie Parker in the '40s; Buddy Holly in the '50s; Jimi Hendrix
in the '60s; Paul Simon in the '70s; David Byrne in the '80s. Most
have provided autographed pictures, an invaluable collection that
covers the walls of the stores.
   ``Elvis Presley is the only big rock star who never walked in
the store. ... We delivered stuff to his hotel,'' says Goldrich.
   Manny's and Rudy's Music Stop across the street still cater to
the big names, but most of their old neighbors are gone. There were
once 25 music stores along the strip that comprised the Big Apple's
bandstand. Today, a half-dozen remain, the rest replaced by the
westward creep of Rockefeller Center and the eastern move of
grocery stores and fast-food joints.
   Such intrusions don't mean the area has lost its magnetism for
musicians, who still pass through midtown construction and the
surrounding porno shops to check out what's what.
   ``Go to West 48th Street to look at all the guitars and amps. Go
to Manny's and Rudy's. Look at all the great new equipment. That's
my idea of a good time,'' Lou Reed told Rolling Stone. Most
musicians heed his advice.
   Guns N' Roses featured the store in their video for ``Paradise
City.'' Soviet rock star Boris Grebenshikov hit the 48th Street
shops shortly after arriving in the United States to examine the
merger of music and capitalism. And then there's the time Mark
Knopfler turned a salesman into a sideman at Rudy's Music Stop.
   Part-time Rudy's worker Jack Sonni met Knopfler through the
shop, which the Dire Straits leader began frequenting in 1979. Five
years later, Sonni signed on with Dire Straits for the ``Brothers
in Arms'' LP after getting a surprise invite from Knopfler.
   At least Sonni knew who Knopfler was. When Guns N' Roses
guitarists Izzy Stradlin and Slash showed up at Manny's, Goldrich
didn't have a clue as to their identities.
   ``The music now is very heavy metal, which is not my favorite.
You can't whistle it,'' said Goldrich _ Itzhak Perlman is his kind
of musician. ``But the kids _ they're probably just as nice.''
   When Goldrich started in the business, the musicians were as
hard up for cash as the struggling Manny. A day's receipts could
total $18; many of the musicians bought on credit and took a long
time to pay, he says.
   ``Charlie Parker used to come in and play tenor sax, and
Gillespie played piano, and we used to have the greatest jam
sessions in the world,'' Goldrich recalled. ``Coltrane (tenor and
soprano saxophone) was there. Coltrane _ there's guy that owed me a
lot of money.''
   Goldrich is understandably proud of the autographed pictures
that line his store. On a small portion of one wall, The Who, the
Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin, Hendrix, Buddy Holly and Bob Dylan
sit side by side.
   ``Keep one eye closed at all cost,'' advised Dylan on his
picture.
   Goldrich himself is a one-man rock 'n' roll repository. He sold
guitars for Hendrix's and Holly's families after their deaths. His
friends include Ella Fitzgerald, John Entwistle and James Taylor.
   And he has a bit of advice _ good advice, for once _ for anybody
hoping to open a place on 48th Street.
   ``When somebody walks in the store that's famous, I think they
get worse treatment than the standard customer,'' said Goldrich.
``We're not on them constantly. ... They come in here, they wander
through the store. I don't go in awe of these guys.''

<HEAD>Not Your Average Bull Market</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not to be outdone by other industries in an age
of business innovation, Wall Street has come up with a new
phenomenon _ the ``no frills'' bull market.
   As in classic bull markets of yore, stock prices have risen
sharply and steadily this year, reaching record highs. Closing in
on the second anniversary of the fearsome market meltdown of
October 1987, the stock tables seem to proclaim ``What Crash?''
   But, from the perspective of many brokers and investors alike,
many of the once-standard trappings of a great bull market are
conspicuously absent.
   What kind of bull market is it, for example, when all the
brokers aren't getting rich?
   Before the big drop in 1987, a membership seat on the New York
Stock Exchange was sold for $1.15 million. Last week, the best
price a seat could bring was $475,000.
   At a time when stock prices are going through the roof,
investment firms should be coining money.
   Yet the trend in securities-industry profits to be reported soon
for the third quarter of the year is ``clearly deteriorating,'' in
the words of analyst David Eisenberg at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   In most cases, moves to record peaks in stock prices are
accompanied by new highs in trading volume.
   But activity this year is running barely ahead of its pace in
1988, when New York Stock Exchange volume was down 14.5 percent
from 1987.
   On a less measurable level, many market participants say the big
gains this year haven't caught the public's fancy the way the good
old bull markets did. The story of the market's full recovery from
the crash of 1987 isn't drawing anywhere near the attention that
the big drop commanded two years ago.
   Many observers attribute the dearth of public enthusiasm to a
long-standing trend, evident in both government statistics and
private surveys, for individual investors to shift away from direct
ownership of stocks into alternatives such as mutual funds.
   Then there is also the suspicion, often voiced if difficult to
prove, that just about all the money in the market these days is
being made by big-time takeover specialists and professionals
engaged in computer-program trading.
   ``A majority of individual investors remain unconvinced that the
bull market is real,'' says Andrew Lanyi, who heads a division
specializing in retail brokerage at the firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann
&amp; Co. ``Investors believe that the bull market is very narrow and
is attributed largely to takeover stocks and a few blue chip
issues.''
   Some say these perceptions are misguided. In a survey of
investors commissioned by the American Stock Exchange in August and
September, more than two-thirds of the respondents said they hadn't
lost confidence in the market since the crash.
   But other data lend at least partial support to the view that
the 1989 model bull market hasn't yet become a vehicle for the
masses.
   Consider the recent performance of two market indexes calculated
by Frank Russell Co., investment consultants. The Russell 1000,
made up of the stocks with the biggest market value, has handily
outperformed the Russell 2000, composed of smaller issues, this
year.
   That demonstrates that the bull market lately has been less
bountiful among many secondary stocks than it has been for the
big-name issues most heavily owned by investing institutions and
used in program-trading strategies.
   Another reason why ``the individual isn't there,'' said Lanyi,
has been the persistent bearishness of many investment advisory
services with large followings among the public.
   Assuming that they will sooner or later turn bullish, Lanyi
suggests, these advisers and their subscribers represent an
untapped source of future fuel for the bull market.
   ``In my opinion,'' he said, ``it has much farther to go.''

<HEAD>Cost-Cutting Peronist Government to Review Free Tuition at University</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: The spelling ``Jaim'' is correct in 6th graf.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN FERNANDEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Free tuition and open enrollment
at the once-prestigious University of Buenos Aires is under study
as part of the Peronist government's program to control costs and
improve public services.
   The university has an enrollment of 175,000 in 10 schools.
   ``We must bring education in line with reality, just as
President Carlos Menem has done with the economy,'' Education
Minister Antonio Salonia said in a recent radio interview.
``Unrestricted university admission will be reviewed.''
   But student and leftist political groups already have charged
that cutbacks would reduce the upward mobility of Argentina's
working poor.
   The university suffers the same problems afflicting the
government: demand is overwhelming, but resources and programs have
been eroded by inflation and a lack of funds.
   Nowadays at the university that was once considered the best in
Latin America, upper-level students teach newer ones, teachers
forced by low salaries to take other jobs sometimes skip classes,
and the quality of instruction has diminished.
   ``Nobody is really committed to the effort required for a good
university,'' Guillermo Jaim Etcheverry, dean of the School of
Medicine, said in an interview.
   ``The problem is the system, not the students. It is a system
that promises much more than it is prepared to deliver. The system
is an illusion.''
   Argentines, who have a literacy rate of 90 percent or better,
consider free schooling a basic right.
   President Juan D. Peron in the 1950s did away with tuition and
eased entrance exams at the University of Buenos Aires.
   Teachers, administrators and students at the university say,
however, the dropout rate now is high, test scores are low,
classrooms crowded, equipment and libraries outdated, students can
retake exams until they pass, and wages are as low as 15,000
australs ($23) a month for parttime professors.
   The university also has suffered from staff purges and rigid
curriculums imposed by successive left-wing and right-wing
governments over the past four decades.
   ``The idea is to get the degree, not necessarily learn,'' said
Alejandro Nunez, a 28-year-old lawyer who graduated from the
university and remains on its student-faculty board of advisers.
   Hector Torres, dean of the School of Natural Sciences, wrote
recently in the newspaper La Nacion that the university is in
danger of becoming a ``degree factory.''
   The university opened its doors in 1823. Tuition has been low
since the university reforms of 1918. Exams to regulate the number
and aptitude of first-year students were abolished following Raul
Alfonsin's election as president in October 1983 to replace a
military dictatorship; enrollment surged by about 60,000.
   ``After 10 years of being kept out ... there was a huge backlog
of students who wanted a university education,'' said Antonio
Donini, dean of the graduate school at the privately run University
of Belgrano, which was founded in Buenos Aires in 1964 and has an
enrollment this year of 18,000.
   ``They could enter the university without any examination,''
Donini added. ``A student only needed a high school diploma.
Grades, (or) which high school a student went to, did not matter.''
   The English-language Buenos Aires Herald newspaper commented in
a recent editorial: ``For nearly half a decade, the utopian
principle of unrestricted university admission has been in effect,
imposing hopelessly overcrowded lecture halls on the brighter
students by luring in young people who should never be there and
thus making university education impossible for everybody.''
   The university's own data, cited by La Nacion, indicate that 11
of every 12 graduates of the School of Medicine failed exams given
by hospitals in 1987 for doctors applying for residencies.
   Consumer advocates complain it is almost impossible to monitor
standards among lawyers because law school graduates are not
obliged to pass a bar exam before opening a practice.
   Businesses are forced to extensively train new employees because
college graduates often are unprepared for the work they were hired
to do, according to a Gallup survey.
   Menem, who took office July 8, has pledged to reduce the
dominant role of the state in the economy as a way to balance the
national budget and improve the quality of public services.
   Plans are being drawn up to sell the state telephone company,
railroad and airline, and to seek foreign investment to help
develop the oil industry.

   Narcotics officers seize a mound of cocaine
and say it's worth $300,000 on the street. But whose street?
   A crack dealer is arrested carrying dozens of crack rocks worth
$1,000, officials say. But what is a rock?
   An informal survey by The Associated Press of narcotics officers
nationwide found a kilo of cocaine ranges from $10,000 in Los
Angeles to $35,000 in Iowa City to almost $70,000 in Shreveport, La.
   The street price of powdered cocaine, meanwhile, ranges from $16
per gram in Los Angeles to $20 for poor quality powder in Yakima,
Wash., to $35 in New York City to as much as $125 in Iowa City and
Shreveport.
   A ``rock'' of crack cocaine, meanwhile, generally runs about $20
nationwide, but the size of the rock varies tremendously, even
within one city.
   Drug Enforcement Administration officials often get wary when
asked the street value of cocaine. Spokesman Frank Shults cites
``the extreme variations in major cities across the country, the
widespread variation in purity level and the frequent, regular
market fluctuations.''
   The street value also doesn't reflect the wholesaler's loss, a
crucial factor when law enforcement is trying to cripple drug
trafficking organizations.
   When officials do try to estimate the street value of drugs
seized, they sometimes trip over themselves.
   Federal agents in Los Angeles seized about 20 tons of cocaine
from a warehouse Sept. 29, the largest such seizure in history.
Local DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge issued the first ``very
conservative'' estimate of street value _ $2 billion. The DEA
special agent heading the Los Angeles office, John M. Zienter,
later placed the street value at $20 billion.
   Meanwhile, Los Angeles police calculate the street value of
cocaine at $170,250 per pound, making the haul worth $7 billion.
   But the people who bought that cocaine lost far less than even
$2 billion. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Tim Beard said the
price per kilo runs about $10,000 to $15,000, depending on the
quantity and buyer. Based on the $10,000 price, the 20 tons would
have cost $181 million.
   The impact of Colombia's crackdown on drug traffickers, launched
in August, remains unclear. Cocaine prices have gone up in some
areas while declining in others.
   Law enforcement officials say some of the increase may be due to
entrepreneurs taking advantage of fears that supplies may dry up.
   Wholesale prices of kilos around the country are $14,000 to
$15,000 in far south Texas near the Mexican border; $14,000 to
$18,000 in New York; $16,000 to $18,000 in Dallas; $16,000 to
$20,000 in Seattle and in the Northeast region including Boston;
$18,000 to $20,000 in New Orleans; $18,000 to $24,000 in Colorado;
and about $20,000 in Kansas City, Mo.
   Law enforcement officials say kilo and street prices are
determined by several factors. Among them:
   _Proximity to foreign suppliers or direct connections to them.
   Miami had the lowest price per kilo _ $9,000 to $10,000 _ before
the crackdown, but that has shot up to $20,000, said Metro-Dade
Police Detective George Reyes.
   Surprisingly, one of the lowest prices found in the survey _
$11,000 _ was found in Montana, which is not considered a major
cocaine center.
   Gary Carrell of Montana's Justice Department said the cocaine
was almost 100 percent pure and the sellers apparently had ``good
connections'' to suppliers in Medellin, Colombia.
   _Quantity purchased.
   ``If you're only buying one or two kilos, it could cost you
$20,000 to $23,000, but five to 10 kilos would only cost $18,000 to
$19,000'' per kilo, said John Fernandes of the DEA in Miami.
   Likewise, an ``eight track,'' or eighth of an ounce of cocaine
in Los Angelese costs $100 to $120, a per-gram price of $28 to $34
on the street, said Detective Dennis Zeuner, chief of the narcotics
unit in the Hollywood Division. An ounce of powdered cocaine costs
$450 to $500, reducing the per-gram price to $16 to $18. To buy by
the gram, the price would be $60 to $100, said Beard of the county
sheriff's office.
   _The customer.
   Sellers sometimes offer discounts to regular or potential
customers.
   Mexican sellers are the only source of cocaine in central
Washington state, and if the customer is another Mexican, the price
per kilo ranges from $13,000 to $15,000, said Robert Dreisbach, the
DEA agent in charge of the Yakima office. If the buyer is a
non-Mexican, the price ranges from $17,000 to $19,000.
   A $20 ``rock'' of crack can mean anything from one-sixteenth of
a gram in Tacoma, Wash., to one-tenth of a gram in Minneapolis, to
one-fifth of a gram in San Diego, to one-fourth of a gram in
Washington, D.C. In Los Angeles, one official said a $20 rock is
one-tenth of a gram, another said it's one-fifth of a gram. Smaller
rocks in each place can sell for less, depending on the customer's
savvy.
   Some enterprising juveniles in Miami ``get together $10, buy one
rock from a dealer, break that in two and sell each piece for $10
elsewhere and go back to the dealer to buy another,'' said James N.
Hall of the Miami-based Up Front Drug Information Center.
   Powdered cocaine prices also vary widely.
   In Miami, a gram costs $55 to $60, up from $35 to $40 a year
ago, Reyes said.
   The price in Yakima ranges from $40 to $60, although a gram of
extremely low quality cocaine can be bought for as little as $20,
said Capt. Don Biasio of the local narcotics unit.
   In New York City, police spokesman Sgt. Joseph McConville said
the price of a gram is $35 to $55. In Iowa City and Shreveport,
powdered cocaine can cost as much as $125 per gram.
   Other typical street prices for a gram of cocaine: $50 to $75 in
San Diego; $60 to $80 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Seattle; $80 in
Chicago and San Bernardino; $80 to $100 in Dallas, Philadelphia,
Montana and Louisiana; $100 in Harlingen, Texas; $100 to $120 in
Minneapolis and $120 in Kansas City, Mo.
   The purity of the cocaine, 80 percent to 95 percent in most
areas, also is dependent on location and market conditions. Low
prices don't always reflect poor quality cocaine.
   For example, in Los Angeles, purity levels for powdered cocaine
on the street range between 75 percent and 95 percent, said Beard.
For kilos, it runs an average of 95 percent, he said. The prices
are relatively low because of the drug's availability, he said.
   In Spokane, Lt. Roger Bragdon, the commander of special
investigations, said the cocaine in his city is 85 percent to 90
percent pure.
   ``If you cut it in the Northwest, you can't sell it _ and you
might get killed,'' Bragdon said.
   The situation is similar in Seattle, but 40 miles away in
Tacoma, police narcotics investigator Dick Caron said a gram on the
street ranges from 20 percent to 80 percent pure, kilos from 60
percent to 80 percent pure.
   And in Yakima, in south-central Washington, Biasio said cocaine
on the street usually is 85 percent to 95 percent pure, but a
recent bust yielded cocaine that was only 60 percent pure.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Shaken by Controversy Over `Obscene' Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts, shaken by
a conservative furor over subsidizing ``obscene art,'' is getting a
new chairman this week who promises to strike a balance between
free-wheeling artistic freedom and respect for the public's trust.
   ``We are not the nation's official pornographer, and it's
important that the country know that,'' said John E. Frohnmayer, a
47-year-old lawyer from Portland, Ore., who takes command of the
beleaguered arts endowment Tuesday.
   Nonetheless, some members of the cultural community are
expressing fear that the bitter controversy over the endowment's
role in financing controversial art might undermine future support
for bold, innovative _ and unpopular _ artistic ventures.
   The worst political crisis in the NEA's 24-year history began
earlier this year when conservative members of Congress were
outraged to discover that $45,000 in endowment funds had been used
to support two exhibitions they found offensive.
   One featured works by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe
that included homosexual and sadomasochistic themes and pictures of
nude children. The other show, by artist Andres Serrano, featured a
photograph of a crucifix submerged in a container of urine.
   In a surprise move, Jesse Helms, R-N.C., won Senate approval of
his sweeping proposal to prohibit spending federal funds on
``obscene and indecent'' art or any work that ``denigrates, debases
or reviles'' anybody on the basis of race, creed, sex, handicap,
age or national origin.
   His amendment to the arts endowment's $171 million
appropriations bill caused a furor in the arts community, and
House-Senate negotiators finally produced a compromise last week
that contains a watered-down version of the Helms proposal.
   Approved by the House and awaiting final Senate action was
legislation barring government financing of works that ``may be
obscene'' and lack ``serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value'' _ the Supreme Court's 1973 guideline on
obscenity.
   The NEA chairman, however, would retain authority to make final
decisions on the artistic merit of grant applications.
   Also, the bill earmarks $250,000 for a 12-member commission to
study the NEA's grant-making process to determine whether new
standards should be adopted governing federal subsidies for
controversial art.
   ``It's certainly going to put a chill in the air, because the
endowment is being asked not only to judge artistic quality but to
act as a moral watchdog,'' said Martin Friedman, director of the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
   Hoping to avoid becoming embroiled in the controversy,
Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art canceled plans to display the
traveling Mapplethorpe exhibition last July, but the move backfired
disastrously.
   The venerable museum suffered artist boycotts, the resignation
of the museum's chief curator, loss of a $1.5 million bequest from
artist Lowell Nesbitt, a plunge in staff morale and a tarnishing of
the Corcoran's reputation as a showcase for contemporary American
art. The Corcoran trustees are studying how to repair the damage,
including whether director Christina Orr-Cahall should be fired.
   Frohnmayer, vacationing in Oregon late last week, said in a
telephone interview that he intends to shift public attention from
the Mapplethorpe-Serrano controversy to the endowment's largely
overlooked ``good works'' in underwriting artistic excellence.
   ``We have a very fine line to walk here between continuing
artistic freedom and maintaining the public trust, when you're
using taxpayer dollars,'' said Frohnmayer, a former chairman of the
Oregon State Arts Commission.
   He rejects any notion that he'll be coming to Washington as a
government censor. But he intends to find out ``how we got into
this controversy in the first place, and to make sure we avoid a
similar controversy in the future.''
   Frohnmayer said he specifically will take steps to ensure
greater NEA control over grants to local arts institutions that
currently dispense the money to artists at their discretion.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibition was organized by the University of
Pennsylvania's Institute for Contemporary Art in Philadelphia and
partially financed by an NEA grant. Serrano's works were
underwritten by endowment funds awarded to the Southeastern Center
for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Frohnmayer will succeed Frank Hodsoll, who departed in February,
as chairman of the independent federal agency, which dispensed $156
million last year to about 800 artists and 3,800 arts institutions,
from major symphony orchestras and opera companies to poets, folk
artists and small-town theater companies.
   Grants are awarded after an exhaustive selection process
involving ``peer panel review'' of applicants by fellow artists.
These panels' recommendations are subject to approval by the NEA
chairman and the National Council on the Arts, the endowment's
independent, presidentially appointed advisory body.
   Besides putting the government's imprimatur on cultural
endeavors of the highest quality, endowment officials say, the
matching grants serve as a catalyst for private financial support
of the arts. They estimate that every federal dollar spent in NEA
grants has yielded more than $5 in contributions from individuals,
corporations and foundations.
   The endowment is no stranger to political controversy. It has
weathered recurring congressional hearings on its grant-making
process. It rebuffed allegations by conservative lawmakers a few
years ago that it was subsidizing ``pornographic poetry'' and
wasting taxpayers' money on projects to design a new bathtub and
make clothing from sheet metal.
   But Livingston L. Biddle, who drafted the legislation that
created the arts endowment in 1965 and served as NEA chairman under
President Carter, said ``there has been nothing in my experience
like the firestorm that erupted'' over Mapplethorpe and Serrano.
   Biddle is confident the Helms controversy won't inhibit the
endowment's nurturing of artistic freedom, but he sees an
affirmation of John Milton's warning that freedom involves
responsibility.
   ``What has emerged is a cautionary signal to the endowment that
it must be alert to difficulties that could arise from the
extremely controversial,'' said Biddle.
   ``We're all pretty worried about censorship,'' said Deborah
Butterfield, a Bozeman, Mont., sculptor who serves on an endowment
oversight panel on the visual arts.
   ``I think it's vital to preserve the voices that threaten people
like Mr. Helms,'' she said. ``The purpose of art is to make people
look at things in a different way, to solve problems in a creative
way. That is not necessarily comfortable for those in power.''
   Richard Andrews, director of the University of Washington's
Henry Art Gallery in Seattle, said the ``really diabolical effect
of the Helms amendment'' will be its inhibiting influence on
artists rather than endowment bureaucrats.
   In closing House debate on the issue last week, Rep. Fred
Grandy, R-Iowa, himself a former actor on television's ``The Love
Boat,'' said he hoped his colleagues weren't getting into the
business of defining ``what is good taste and what is bad taste''
in the arts.
   Grandy noted mischievously that the current production of a
local, NEA-supported theater includes what he called ``transvestism
and implied lesbian love.''
   The play, he said, is Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night,'' appearing
at the Folger Shakespeare Theater.

   A new wave of violence, recalling the
worst of the brutal days of military rule, is sweeping across this
Central American nation.
   A rash of assassinations, kidnappings and bombings has eroded
the fragile hopes that a working democracy can take firm root.
   Shadowy organizations like the White Hand and Jaguar Justice are
on the prowl again. Grenades are tossed. Anonymous voices hiss
death threats into telephones. Student leaders, peasants, labor
leaders vanish or flee the country. A leading banker is gunned down
in his home.
   President Vinicio Cerezo has survived two coup attempts, but
people speak of a democracy defrauded and some claim Cerezo is
unwilling to do anything about it.
   ``Ambition, corruption and immorality in so many hearts have
bred monstrous personalities,'' Guatemala's Roman Catholic bishops
said in an anguished message about the wave of violence.
   The kidnappings, murders, tortures and bombings of recent weeks
stem from a lethal mix.
   Some of the killing is blamed on a 28-year-old leftist guerrilla
insurgency and the brutal effort to suppress it. Some is blamed on
right-wing extremists trying to destabilize the government, some on
elements of the state security apparatus. And then there is the
influx of drug traffickers.
   ``Is there any hope for Guatemala?'' asked Peter Kooijmans, a
special envoy from the U.N. Human Rights Commission drawn here by
the deteriorating situation. He does not have the answer.
   For an expert on torture like Kooijmans, this Ohio-sized country
of almost 9 million people is fertile ground. Bodies commonly turn
up with their hands chopped off or partly flayed or bearing signs
of electric shock.
   Neither violence nor political uncertainty is new to Guatemala.
What makes the current crisis so disturbing is that it represents
the crumbling of hopes _ again.
   ``The expectations of the 1985 elections have vanished in a
matter of months,'' said labor leader Sergio Guzman.
   Guatemala's previous experience with democracy ended in 1954
with a CIA-backed coup against President Jacobo Arbenz, a
reformist. An estimated 100,000 people died and 40,000 disappeared
in the three decades of political violence that followed under
military rule.
   Those deaths included thousands of victims of a brutal
counterinsurgency campaign that Defense Minister Hector Gramajo
once said ``used the techniques of an occupation army in our own
country.''
   Hundreds of Indian villages in rebel territory were wiped out.
The labor movement was driven underground. Labor leader Guzman
recalls unionists meeting secretly in churches and convents during
the early 1980s.
   Many Guatemalans saw the return of civilian government in 1986,
with Cerezo at the head, as the beginning of the end of a long,
bloody nightmare, but the optimism of those first years is dying.
   ``The most regressive forces in our country are trying to
neutralize the most progressive,'' said Edgar Agusto Portillo
Recinos, dean of the economics faculty at the University of San
Carlos.
   The current violence began heating up with a teachers' strike
over wages that began in May and lasted until August. There also
was a coup attempt in May. In July, when Cerezo tried to deliver a
nationwide address, a television station was blown off the air.
   On Aug. 21, armed men with walkie talkies began whisking student
leaders off the streets of Guatemala City in broad daylight.
   Four bodies bearing signs of torture turned up near the
University of San Carlos on Sept. 10. A fifth was found a week
later in a ravine used as a body dump during the dark days of
military rule. Five students are still missing.
   The Central American Report, independently published by
Inforpress Centroamericana and distrubuted to embassies,
businesses, educational institutions and other private groups,
lists 77 political killings since mid-August, but nobody knows how
bad it really is in the countryside.
   Maria Rumalda Camey was one case. She was the wife of a peasant
farmer and a member of a humans rights support group. Near the end
of August men came in the night and dragged her from her home.
   Her family _ seven children and three adults _ hid out with the
Red Cross for six weeks before making a terrified dash across a
rain-slicked sidewalk to a waiting Spanish Embassy van and
political asylum.
   Her husband, Jose, spent his last night in Guatemala hanging
tattered laundry and trying to patch together battered suitcases.
He tried to fight off despair as he faced raising two babies alone
in a strange land.
   ``I'll be afraid, but I would be afraid here,'' he said.
``Guatemala is returning to the bloody times.''
   Diplomats, political analysts and human rights activists all say
the student disappearances seem to be the product of a military
operation.

<HEAD>GUATEMALA CITY: military operation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   One diplomat in close contact with the Guatemalan military said
the brazenness and the technical proficiency _ the weapons,
vehicles and communications equipment _ as well as the careful
targeting of victims are earmarks of a security forces operation.
   The students may have been suspected of links to leftist
guerrillas; several were involved in the teacher's strike. To many
conservatives here, association with a union movement is enough to
brand someone as an extreme leftist.
   Peasant and labor leaders and human rights activists also have
suffered in the backlash to a surge in political activity since
1986.
   Cerezo and his Christian Democrats blame a rightist campaign to
destabilize the government. But the government also is seen by some
as ineffective and incompetent, paralyzed by fear of rightist
violence.
   Mario Sandoval Alarcon, a former vice president and leader of
the right-wing National Liberation Movement, said Guatemalans will
be ready to vote for a law-and-order president, perhaps even a
military candidate, in November 1990.
   Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who presided over some of Guatemala's
worst savagery in the early 1980s, when reported deaths and
disappearances ran as high as 500 a month, has already announced
his availability.
   The newest threat to Guatemalan peace and democracy appears to
be drug trafficking.
   On Aug. 24 four men broke into the home of banker Ramiro
Castillo Love and shot him to death.
   ``He refused to launder drug money,'' said Sandoval, a friend of
Castillo's. Sandoval's assessment was shared by several diplomatic
sources and political analysts.
   ``There is no doubt that it was an execution designed to put the
fear of god into the banking community,'' one diplomat said.
   The death Aug. 1 of Danilo Barillas, a Christian Democrat, is
also said to be linked to the drug trade. Barillas headed a
commission looking into corruption inside his party and is widely
believed to have found links to Colombian cocaine cartels.
   Many on the right believe the drug traffickers and the
guerrillas, reduced to perhaps fewer than 2,000 fighters, have
formed an unholy alliance.
   While there is no hard evidence of that, the guerrilla war has
taken a higher profile. The guerrillas have begun staging
attention-getting attacks close to urban areas.
   Diplomatic pressure is on Cerezo to rein things in, but so far
he has done nothing.
   The Central America Report and diplomats say the U.N. Human
Rights Commission is considering returning Guatemala to a list of
persistent human rights violators _ a list it left in 1987.
   A U.S. State Department travel-advisory warning of
``indiscriminate terrorist attacks,'' crime and clashes between the
army and guerrillas will probably cut into tourism.
   All U.S. aid was suspended in 1977 because of human rights
violations. Economic aid resumed early in the Reagan administration
and military aid in 1985.
   For 1989, non-military aid amounts to $153 million and military
aid to $9.5 million. The army has also bought 20,000 M-16 rifles
for $13.8 million _ $200,000 below a limit that would have required
U.S. congressional approval.
   Human rights advocate Nineth de Garcia believes Cerezo is doing
nothing because behind-the-scene negotiations after the coup
attempts gave the security forces a free hand.
   ``He has negotiated with the blood of the people,'' she charged.
   When Cerezo took office he said he would consider himself a
success if he handed over power to another elected president. In
today's Guatemala, that may well turn out to be his major
accomplishment.
   ``His government will survive,'' Portillo Recinos predicted
bitterly. ``But the country is being destroyed.''

<HEAD>`National Geographic Explorer' Traces Hunt for Sunken German Warship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riding the waves, the Bismarck plowed across
the seas as the fiercest fighting ship in World War II. Collapsed
on the ocean floor, the German battleship looks cowed, a beaten
Nazi relic.
   The 1941 sinking of the Bismarck _ and this year's discovery of
its eerily well-preserved wreckage _ is the subject of ``National
Geographic Explorer,'' airing on cable's TBS on Oct. 29 at 9 p.m.
EST.
   The host of the one-hour special is Robert Ballard, the
oceanographer who previously discovered the remains of the Titanic.
The 1987 television account of the Titanic find still stands as
basic cable's most popular show.
   ``The Bismarck initially was just another hunt, just another
ship,'' Ballard said. ``But when I saw the faded remains of the
swastika on the ship's bow and stern, and a solitary seaman's boot
lying on the ocean floor, that symbolized to me the great tragedy
of World War II.''
   Ballard's Bismarck show will repeat Oct. 30 at midnight EST and
Nov. 4 at 8 a.m. EST. A videocassette of the program will be
released in December by National Geographic, whose November
magazine also details the Bismarck exploration.
   The Bismarck was the most formidable battleship of its era. In
its first tour of duty, the 820-foot floating fortress literally
blew Britain's prize battle cruiser Hood out of the water, killing
all but three of the Hood's 1,419-person crew.
   ``At the time, it was the most powerful ship on the sea,'' Peter
Schnall, co-producer of the Bismarck documentary, said of the
German warship. ``It threatened to stop basically all of the supply
ships that were coming in through the North Atlantic to England.''
   A terrorized Britain put every available warship into the
1,750-mile chase after the Bismarck. Prime Minister Winston
Churchill made his orders to his navy perfectly clear: ``Sink the
Bismarck!''
   Two days after destroying the Hood and racing for protection,
the Bismarck was crippled by a British torpedo-equipped biplane and
the country's carrier Ark Royal. The combined assault ruined the
Bismarck's steering gear and rudders.
   Functionally immobile, the warship was bombarded all night and
finally scuttled by the Germans. Only 115 of the Bismarck's 2,200
hands survived.
   ``The Germans put everything into'' the battleship, Schnall
said. ``But like everything, it had an Achilles heel. Knock out the
rudder and it's like a big ship with nowhere to go.''
   Ballard's finding the Bismarck required almost as much
determination and luck as did Britain's sinking it. With sonar and
video and still cameras whirring away, Ballard spent two summers
combing a 100-square mile area of the ocean's bottom 600 miles west
of Brest, France.
   ``Ballard's cabin was a couple of doors down from us,'' said
Schnall, who accompanied the oceanographer on the search. ``And all
of sudden one morning, we hear this incredible scream because
Ballard has a video monitor in his room. He had just woken up and
he saw it: just as (the underwater camera) was crossing the
midsection of the ship, right across the gun turrets.
   ``And he let out a whoop. That woke me up, we ran down and
grabbed our camera just as he was running out the door. ... It was
one of those rare moments in film when you catch something exactly
as it happens.''
   What Ballard's cameras found more than 15,000 feet below the
surface of the Atlantic startled the team.
   ``It looked like the ship had just been launched from its
original berth,'' Schnall said. ``It sat straight up on its
bottom.''
   There were no skeletons or human bones in sight.
   ``The exciting thing (about making the documentary) is that it
is almost like a natural story,'' Schnall said. ``You have the
Bismarck going out, you have the Bismarck eluding the British, and
then eventually being sunk.
   ``And we have an explorer (Ballard) who goes to find the
Bismarck, can't find it, has to regroup himself, and then go back
out again the next year and find it.''
   After the filmmakers collected footage of the Bismarck's
wreckage, they met with some of the men who once served on her
decks and showed them the underwater footage.
   ``Very slowly, they started to say, `Yes. Isn't that the gun
where I was standing?' Or, `Wasn't that the deck where so-and-so
was standing before it went down?'
   ``And on and on it went. Eventually, they saw the swastika on
the stern of the ship. ... One of the survivors, Heinrich Kuhnt,
was asked what it felt like to have survived this horrible sea
battle. And he hesitated. And slowly tears filled his eyes and he
couldn't stop crying.''

   Zaw Ye says he fled to the jungle after
being beaten by soldiers with truncheons in Rangoon and seeing a
young woman who tried to help him pinned to the ground and killed
by a bayonet thrust through her temple.
   Also at the demonstration in the Burmese capital, he said,
another woman student near him was struck in the head and as she
reeled a second blow popped one of her eyes out.
   Zaw Ye and other students then came to a conclusion: ``We
realized that no peaceful protests, debates or strikes would work.
The only course is to resort to arms.''
   He and his companions slipped from Rangoon after that
demonstration in July and joined nearly 5,000 others who had
escaped earlier.
   They are pledged to fight Burma's military government until
democracy is won.
   But democracy appears to have become a distant glimmer for the
millions of Burmese who marched in the streets last year and faced
the blazing guns of soldiers who finally put down the uprising in
September 1988.
   Since then a 17-member junta, the State Law and Order
Restoration Council, has wielded power. It has promised elections
next May and is allowing more than 200 political parties to form,
but it simultaneously has arrested several thousand dissidents and
silenced the main opposition leaders.
   After the council took power, the first wave of about 10,000
protesters, leaving wives and families behind, sought the
protection of ethnic minority rebels along Burma's rugged borders
with Thailand, India and China.
   About half of them returned, however, enticed by a government
promise of amnesty and unable to put up with disease, malnutrition
and other hardships. But the border movement did not falter as some
had predicted.
   The military council initially tried to make amends with an
angry population and refurbish its brutal image internationally. It
allowed the daughter of national hero Aung San to campaign and draw
huge crowds.
   But in late July when protests broke out and speeches by Aung
San's daughter Suu Kyi grew increasingly strident, the military
struck again. She was placed under house arrest and martial law was
tightened. The United States charged that political detainees were
being tortured.
   A second wave of dissidents fled to the frontiers, describing
Rangoon as a prison where people feared the military intelligence
and the nighttime knock on the door.
   Today, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front claims a
membership of more than 4,800 students, young professionals,
Buddhist monks and others at 24 border camps. Compared to a year
ago, they appear to be tougher and better organized but also
largely forgotten by the rest of the world.
   ``We have a rough journey ahead of us,'' said the front's
general secretary, Than Win.
   Some students contrast their own status to that of students who
fled military repression in China in June. The Chinese are given
scholarships at U.S. and other universities and international
platforms to voice their protests. The few Burmese students who
tried have had difficulties entering the United States, and
recently Thailand, eager for economic deals with the Burmese
government, expelled those who had crossed into its territory.
   Life is marginal at camps like the one here at Mawke, a base for
260 students who fight alongside the Karen National Union, one of
many ethnic rebel armies struggling for greater autonomy in Burma.
   Set in a forest near the Thai frontier, the camp is a collection
of crudely fashioned thatch huts, offering little protection from
monsoon rains. Two sleepers must sometimes share one blanket and
there are few mosquito nets. Leaders say 75 percent of the student
soldiers have suffered from malaria; each can obtain only about
$3.50 worth of food rations a month.
   The Karen-trained students at Mawke have only about 100 weapons
of assorted makes and the ammunition they carry most likely would
run out in about 10 minutes of combat. They acknowledge they could
not face a main force Burmese unit without Karen help.
   Student leaders emphasize propaganda work in villages deeper
inside Burma where they claim to be warmly received. Units pass out
leaflets, give talks, entertain and help villagers clear trails,
dig latrines and build small schools.
   An hour's walk from Mawke, the student front has built a school
for its own members. Opened Aug. 1 as the ``Jungle University,''
its staff of teachers and doctors who fled with the students
teaches political science, English, Thai, basic medicine,
agriculture and other subjects.
   The students hope the U.S. Congress will pass legislation that
would provide them up to $2.25 million worth of assistance to
supplement the meager funds they now receive from various Burmese
exile groups and other private donors.
   The United States and much of the inernational community have
shunned Burma politically since last year but the military
government has been able to attract some investors by opening the
country to foreign businessmen for the first time in a quarter
century.
   Critics charge that much of the badly needed foreign currency
being earned goes to buy weapons for the fight against the ethnic
minorities with whom the students are allied.
   Although one Western diplomat based in Rangoon said that ``the
students have been wrecked or driven to the border into
irrelevance,'' other analysts give more balanced assessments and
the student front sees itself at the forefront of the pro-democracy
fight.
   The front's chairman, Htun Aung Kyaw, said that despite the
sweeping arrests of dissidents, the border camps can maintain links
with underground, anti-government cells in Burma. Their own ranks,
he said, could easily be swelled from the interior but this is
discouraged because the camps could not cope with an influx.
   ``We are young, brave and we are not selfish,'' the chairman
added in an interview. ``Students are the only ones the people
trust. We give the people inside courage and can tell the outside
world what is happening in our country.''
   Students have traditionally been at the cutting edge of Burmese
politics and the front hopes to endow itself with the aura of
future leadership.
   Last February, 30 student leaders met to seal their pledge to
end authoritarian rule by drinking drops of their own blood mixed
in a silver cup.
   It was the same ritual Burma's nearly legendary ``Thirty
Comrades'' went through during World War II when they pledged to
liberate the country from the British.

<HEAD>What Senators, Regulators Said About Lincoln Savings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-S&amp;L Victims, b0764-b0765</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from an April 10, 1987, memo written by
William Black, a savings and loan regulator in San Francisco, to
Edwin Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Black and other regulators met privately in Washington with five
U.S. senators who questioned the handling of Lincoln Savings, its
parent company American Continental Corp., and its chairman,
Charles Keating, who was a large contributor to the senators.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, responsible for
overseeing savings banks in California, Nevada and Arizona, wanted
to seize Lincoln in 1987. After Keating's complaints, supervision
was transferred to Washington. Regulators finally seized control of
Lincoln last April, after ACC filed for bankruptcy protection.

   SEN. DENNIS DeCONCINI, D-Ariz.: We wanted to meet with you
because we have determined that potential actions of yours could
injure a constituent. ... They (Lincoln) have two major
disagreements with you. First, with regard to direct investment
(where the S&amp;L becomes a partner in a real estate venture). Second,
on your reappraisal. They're suing against your direct investment
regulation. ... We suggest that the lawsuit be accelerated and that
you grant them forbearance while the suit is pending. I know
something about the appraisal values of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. They appear to be grossly unfair. ... Lincoln is prepared to
reach a compromise value with you.
   SEN. ALAN CRANSTON, D-Calif.: (Arriving.) I'm sorry I can't join
you, but I have to be on the floor to deal with the bill. I just
want to say that I share the concerns of the other senators on this
subject. (Cranston leaves).
   SEN. JOHN McCAIN, R-Ariz.: One of our jobs as elected officials
is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC is a big employer
and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special
favors for them. ... I don't want any part of our conversation to
be improper. ... I'd like to mention the appraisal issue. It seems
to me ... there's a problem. Arizona is the second fastest growing
state. Land values are skyrocketing. That has to be taken account
of in appraisals.
   SEN. JOHN GLENN, D-Ohio: ... Even the accounting firm says
you've taken an unusually adversary view toward Lincoln. To be
blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs. If things are
bad there, get to them. ...
   JAMES CIRONA, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San
Francisco: This meeting is very unusual, to discuss a particular
company.
   DeCONCINI: It's very unusual for us to have a company that could
be put out of business by its regulators. ...
   RICHARD SANCHEZ, supervisory agent: Lincoln had underwriting
problems with all of their investments. ... The examiners looked at
52 real estate loans that Lincoln had made since the 1984 exam.
There were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan
files. ...
   CIRONA: These underwriting practices violate our regulatory
guidelines.
   BLACK: They are also an unsafe and unsound practice. ...
   SEN. DONALD RIEGLE, D-Mich.: Where's the smoking gun? Where are
the losses?
   DeCONCINI: What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up
their act?
   CIRONA: This is a ticking time bomb. ...
   RIEGLE: These people saved a failing thrift. ACC is reputed to
be highly competent.
   BLACK: Lincoln was not a failing thrift before ACC acquired it.
It met its net worth requirement. It had returned to profitability
before it was acquired. ...
   MICHAEL PATRIARCA, director of agency functions: I'm relatively
new to the savings and loan industry, but I've never seen any bank
or S&amp;L that's anything like this. This isn't even close. You can
ask any banker you know about these practices. They violate the law
and regulations and common sense.
   GLENN: What violates the law?
   PATRIARCA: Their direct investments violate the regulation. Then
there's the file stuffing. They took undated documents purporting
to show underwriting efforts and put them into the files sometimes
more than a year after ...
   GLENN: Have you done anything about these violations of law?
   PATRIARCA: We're sending a criminal referral to the Department
of Justice. Not maybe, we're sending one. This is an
extraordinarily serious matter. ...
   DeCONCINI: The criminality surprises me. We're not interested in
discussing those issues. Our premise was that we had a viable
institution concerned that it was being over-regulated.

<TEXT>
   Houses, condos and hotels sit like castles in the sand, a
developer's vision realized next to the waves of the Atlantic and
the Gulf of Mexico.
   But environmentalists see them as interlopers on the shifting
dunes, vulnerable to destructive storms such as Hurricane Hugo.
   ``There's foolishness in building in God's sandbox unreasonably
close to the ocean,'' said Dana Beach of the South Carolina Coastal
Conservation League. ``We have to make sure we're not building or
rebuilding on places that may not be there after the next storm.''
   While Hugo's roar and 135 mph punch have hit and run, a
philosophical squall still blows, pitting private property rights
against the public good.
   Sounding a charge to grow, developers argue people have a right
to build and protect their investment.
   Urging a strategic retreat, environmentalists counter that
overdevelopment is risky and can deny public access to eroding
beaches.
   States from New England to Florida and around to Texas have laws
attempting to preserve the oceanfront. In South Carolina, a 1988
law may prevent the rebuilding of an estimated 213 oceanfront
houses that were at least two-thirds destroyed by Hugo.
   The law prohibits building in a so-called ``dead zone'' 20 feet
behind an established dune line. Owners of damaged homes who don't
have enough property to move inland out of the zone may be out of
luck.
   ``Nature just delivered a very clear and enuciated message. We
have been setting ourselves up for a disaster the way we have
developed the shoreline,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University
geologist and an expert on coastal dynamics. ``If Hugo doesn't
prove that something has to be done, nothing will ever do it.''
   Barrier islands, beaches and dunes are natural lines of defense
that protect the mainlaind. They surrender sand to absorb the
energy of storm waves, then are replenished gradually.
   The problem comes if structures are built on the shifting
shores. Pilkey and others believe that barriers built to protect
buildings actually accelerate erosion.
   What Pilkey and his advocates want is to pull back to give
nature a buffer in which to work, even if it means letting homes
fall into the ocean.
   ``Hugo was a warning shot for the entire U.S. East Coast,'' said
Rob Thieler, a research assistant to Pilkey at Duke. ``We know how
to back up, but are we willing to start knocking down buildings in
New Jersey because Hugo hit in South Carolina?''
   That's an easy question for many developers and coastal
officials.
   Beaches are money machines that lure sun worshippers and tourist
dollars. Realtors and investors have capitalized on the nation's
love affair with the shore by making it attractive to visit.
   ``America is not going to abandon it's coast. People are going
to live at the beach,'' said Richard Beck, former mayor of the
barrier island community of Folly Beach off Charleston.
``Abandonment is a cruel joke. I defy anyone to show me where
abandoning property has brought back the beach.''
   Added John Singleton, an investor in heavily developed Myrtle
Beach, ``You can't expect a man who has a multimillion-dollar hotel
to walk away from it.''
   Another punch faces storm-battered South Carolina. The highest
tides in nine years are forecast for Oct. 16. A $65 million
emergency effort aims to rebuild the dunes to prevent flooding.
   ``It would be like pouring salt into a wound if the tides come
in without any protective barrier,'' said Tucker Eskew, spokesman
for Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   Meanwhile, to protect property from erosion, some beaches have
been armored with seawalls and bulkheads. But these intrusions can
deny public access to the shore, and critics object to spending
public money to protect the ocean views of private landowners.
   Others note that more than just property is at stake in the
debate. Future hurricanes could kill more people if they hit
overdeveloped spots.
   ``Our concern is about the potential loss of life,'' said Robert
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center. ``We need to
restrict the type of development we're seeing.''
   South Carolina had eight lawsuits filed before Hugo. In one
case, it was ordered to pay $1.2 million to a landowner unable to
build on two lots in the dead zone, but it is appealing the case.
   More lawsuits are expected, but other states have had their
share of legal storms after hurricanes.
   After Hurricane Alicia pounded Galveston in 1981, Texas
probihited many residents from rebuilding under its Open Beaches
Act. The court-tested law bans building on the seaward side of a
line of vegetation.
   Alicia's storm surge moved the vegetation line back by as much
as 175 feet.
   ``It's a poker game, building on the beachfront, and it's a
gamble with Mother Nature,'' said Ken Cross, an assistant Texas
attorney general.
   Under a 1981 law, North Carolina decreed that houses must be set
back behind the first line of stable vegetation at a distance 30
times the erosion rate. The distance for larger structures is 60
times. Structures built before the law cannot be rebuilt if they
suffer 50 percent damage in a storm.
   Since 1985, the state has banned seawalls, bulkheads and
revetments to guarantee that beaches are accessible to the public.
   ``It sends a message that these are not very safe places to
build,'' said George Everett, director of theNorth Carolina
Division of Coast Management. ``And we're not going to let
buildings impact on the public's right to have access. The beach
belongs to the public.''
   Florida, which has an 8,000-mile shoreline that is longer than
any state's except Alaska, protects its beaches in a number of ways.
   In one example, nothing can be built beyond the frontal dune,
which is the first raised portion of land from the water's edge. If
a hurricane destroys any building seaward of either the erosion
line or the frontal dune, it can't be rebuilt.
   ``Everybody wants to be able to walk out the door to the
water,'' said Andy Grayson, director of Florida's Division of
Beaches and Shores.
   In Massachusetts, permits are given on a case-by-case basis
under the state's Wetlands Protection Act, which gives the state
authority to deny building or rebuilding.
   ``If you can show you can build without harm to the beach or the
dune, you can do it. (But) we have the authority to deny,'' said
Jeff Benoit, chief of the state's Coastal Zone Management Office.
   Rhode Island, the Ocean State, prohibits building on barrier
beaches and dune crests. A structure built before the law that is
50 percent or more destroyed by a storm cannot be rebuilt without a
permit.
   ``If it's destroyed by a storm, that gives us a pretty good
indication that it may be in an area that's inappropriate to be
built on,'' said Tim Dillingham, a marine resource specialist.
   Georgia's Shore Assistance Act requires a specific set-back for
buildings proposed on sand dunes and barrier islands. An existing
building destroyed by a hurricane must comply with the set-back law.
   New Jersey allows rebuilding, but Gov. Thomas Kean has sought a
coastal protection commission to control development. Kean's order
to require state approval for oceanfront development is being
argued in appeals courts.
   Virginia and Delaware govern new buildings, but not existing
ones damaged by storms. Maryland also does not restrict rebuilding.
   ``There's no doubt people along the Eastern seaboard have built
too close to the ocean,'' said Clay Brittain, a hotel owner in
Myrtle Beach. ``We wouldn't do it again. But you can't move back
completely from a developed area. It's not practical to retreat.''

<HEAD>Boeing Strike Could Give Aerospace Giant Room to Breathe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Too much of a good thing has been bad for Boeing
Co., the world's leading maker of commercial airplanes and the
nation's biggest exporter. So, in a sense, a little bad news might
help.
   Nearly 58,000 unionized machinists struck the company this past
week after contract negotiations collapsed. The workers want a
greater share of Boeing's record profits and less mandatory
overtime, which has kept many toiling seven days a week to fill
staggering order backlogs.
   On first glance, the strike came at a bad time for the
Seattle-based company, which dominates the commercial airplane
market despite intense competition from McDonnell Douglas and
Europe's Airbus Industrie.
   Domestic and foreign airlines ordered more than 700 planes this
year from Boeing, stretching back-orders to more than 1,600
aircraft worth $80 billion, delaying deliveries by months and
irritating customers who had been counting on those planes to
modernize aging fleets.
   Of particular concern to buyers and Boeing management is the
company's commitment to deliver 57 of its new 747-400 jumbo jets by
yearend. Before the strike, Boeing officials had ordered assembly
lines to turn out an unprecedented 27 of the big planes just in the
last three months of the year.
   The strike will almost certainly disrupt that accelerated
schedule, which could cost Boeing late-delivery penalties and
narrow the profit it makes on the new planes. A few important
clients have even dropped hints they want to renegotiate existing
orders or even shop elsewhere.
   The International Association of Machinists has hoped to exploit
this pressure on Boeing to make the company capitulate, in what
labor leaders are calling one of the most important
union-management struggles of the decade.
   But some analysts say the strike could actually help the company
and backfire on the Machinists, a militant and powerful union that
historically has enjoyed enormous influence in the aerospace
industry.
   For one thing, the walkout provides a reasonable excuse for
delivery delays, since it's unlikely customers are going to demand
airplanes assembled by strike replacements or foremen.
   For another, Boeing had maintained such a relentless production
agenda that many of its parts suppliers had failed to keep pace, so
the walkout gives them an opportunity to catch up.
   But perhaps the most important reason the strike may not hurt
Boeing is the nature of the commercial airplane business itself,
built on longstanding relationships between airlines and aircraft
makers. Buyers cannot simply repudiate multibillion-dollar
contracts that stretch over periods of years.
   Even if they could, they may have nowhere else to go to buy the
airplanes they need. Boeing's competitors face many of the same
order-backlog problems that Boeing has.
   McDonnell Douglas, for example, has doubled its work force in
the past two years to satisfy growing demand for new planes, but
the company's productivity has dropped because the new employees
are so inexperienced.
   At Airbus, where production is expected to double within four
years, officials have acknowledged a similar productivity problem.
The 20-year-old four-company consortium also faces pressure from
European governments tired of subsidizing its money-losing
operations.
   Of course, the Boeing strike outcome depends partly on how long
the walkout lasts. Strikers have a $90 million fund that will pay
them $100 a week after the third week, so they won't deplete that
money for more than three months.
   They also may get financial help from other forces in organized
labor, which seem to be targeting Boeing to regain some of the
ground lost over the 1980s to other blue-collar employers in this
country.
   ``The unions have shown that they can no longer deliver higher
wages or increased job security even in the highest-paying
industries _ the airlines, the auto companies, steel and regulated
public utilities,'' said Daniel Lacey, a Cleveland-based consultant
who tracks labor trends.
   ``Aerospace is the last high-paying target industry they have
left, so organized labor just can't afford to lose at Boeing.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Developer Donald Trump lobbed something special in the air at
the parent of American Airlines, a $7 billion takeover proposal,
which if successful would be the biggest in the rapidly
consolidating airline industry. Trump was expected to face a tough
fight from AMR Corp.'s hard-boiled chief executive Robert Crandall,
who has said he wants to keep the No. 1 airline independent.
   _Government statistics suggested more evidence the economy is
slowing. Civilian unemployment rose slightly in September to 5.3
percent, reflecting a shrinkage in manufacturing jobs. Stock and
bond investors liked the news that more people were out of work
because it suggested the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates
to stimulate the econmy.
   _A strategic marriage in the auto business and a sale in the
computer business suggested some new directions by a few well-known
American manufacturers. General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
announced the first-ever Big Three joint venture to make key
automotive parts. Zenith Electronics Corp. sold its fast-growing
computer subsidiary to France's Cie des Machines Bull in order to
concentrate on televisions.

   Researchers on Wall Street appear to have hit
upon a promising antidote for the chills of disastrous Octobers
past.
   The medicine in question combines hopes for falling interest
rates, a strong dollar and steady doses of slow, but sustainable
economic growth.
   So far it seems to be working wonders, lifting stock prices to
record highs at a time when Wall Streeters have plenty of seasonal
memories to dampen their spirits.
   For those who like to keep track of such things, this month
marks the second anniversary of the ``market meltdown'' of 1987.
   Ten years ago, there was the October Massacre of 1979, when
stock prices plunged amid fears of a credit crunch (echoing a
similar selloff in October 1978).
   And 60 years back lingers the specter of the Great Crash of 1929.
   Against this daunting backdrop, stocks got an unexpected boost
as October 1989 began from talk that the Federal Reserve might find
reason before long to consider relaxing its credit policy further.
   Since midyear interest rates had been climbing as investors
concluded that the Fed had less and less reason to worry about a
recession, and thus might shift back toward a restrictive,
inflation-fighting strategy.
   But statistics on wholesale and consumer prices showed no signs
of mounting inflationary pressures as the economy kept chugging
along.
   And heading into the last quarter of the year, the suspicion
began to spread that the Fed might find more maneuvering room to
stimulate the economy without taking any big inflationary risks.
   Those feelings were reinforced on Friday, when the Labor
Department reported that the civilian unemployment rate rose a
tenth of a percentage point in September to 5.3 percent.
   The monthly data also showed an increase of 209,000 in nonfarm
payroll employment, well short of advance estimates on Wall Street
in the range of 275,000 to 300,000.
   Even though several European countries posted increases in
interest rates, the dollar held its ground in foreign exchange and
rates declined in this country.
   That gave the stock market the encouragement it needed to chalk
up the biggest weekly point gain of the year in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   The widely recognized average of 30 blue chips climbed 92.70
points to 2,785.52, for its best weekly showing since it jumped
114.86 points May 31-June 3 of 1988.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.97 to 198.94;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
10.36 to 483.64, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 7.17 at 395.93.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 170.99 million shares a day, up
from 151.48 million the week before.
   Until the last few days, the dollar had been under pressure
against leading foreign currencies since the Group of Seven
industrialized countries issued a statement declaring strength in
the American currency ``inconsistent with longer run economic
fundamentals.''
   That assertion was followed by what Jack Lavery, global research
director at Merrill Lynch, called ``an all-out blitz against the
dollar'' by the nations' central banks.
   Thus, many observers were impressed when the dollar bounced back
quickly on Thursday from the news of interest-rate increases in
West Germany, Britain and other European nations.
   ``Over the long pull capital flows, which we expect to be
strong, almost always have swamped the effects of central bank
intervention,'' said Maury Harris, economist at PaineWebber Inc.
   Harris concluded: ``Recent economic developments are pointing to
lower interest rates.''

<HEAD>Psychosomatic Blindness Among Cambodians Blamed on Khmer Rouge Horrors</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scores of Cambodians complain they are
blind or suffer blurry vision although their eyes are normal _ a
malady some experts blame on the horrors they witnessed in the
killing fields of their native land.
   ``These women saw things that their minds just could not
accept,'' said psychology professor Patricia Rozee-Koker of
California State University, Long Beach, who studies vision
complaints of the Khmer Rouge regime's refugees.
   ``Seventy percent of the women had their immediate family killed
before their eyes,'' she said. ``So their minds simply closed down,
and they refused to see anymore _ refused to see any more death,
any more torture, any more rape, any more starvation.''
   The majority of the refugees with vision complaints are 40- to
70-year-old women who fled the Khmer Rouge regime, which was
toppled a decade ago.
   Experts believe the refugees suffer hysterical, psychosomatic or
functional blindness, in which psychological turmoil spurs people
with normal eyes to believe they are blind or see poorly.
   Many of the Cambodians also show signs of severe depression and
post-traumatic stress disorder, which afflicted many Vietnam War
veterans, Rozee-Koker said.
   Eye doctors said it is very difficult to distinguish patients
with hysterical vision loss from malingerers who fake blindness to
obtain disability benefits, attention or sympathy.
   Some question whether psychological vision problems were
triggered by sights of mass murder in Cambodia, or by trauma
endured by Khmer-speaking Cambodian peasants adjusting to U.S. life.
   ``I think it's a real phenomenon,'' said Dr. Hector Sulit, a
Long Beach eye doctor who examined dozens of Cambodians in recent
years. ``It could be the trauma. ... The other possibility is
cultural shock. There might be a few looking for sympathy.''
   Dr. Michael F. Marmor, ophthalmology chairman at Stanford
University School of Medicine, said Cambodians examined there ``for
the most part were not consciously malingering, although it's
almost impossible to rule out.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed from 1975 to
1978 by Pol Pot's fanatical communist Khmer Rouge, who tried to
transform the nation into an agrarian commune until Vietnam invaded
in late 1978. Nearly 200,000 Cambodians fled to the United States.
Vietnam withdrew its troops in September.
   Hysterical blindness has been reported among shellshocked
soldiers during World War I, children of divorced parents, and
people involved in traffic accidents.
   Five years ago, an unusual number of female Cambodian refugees
with psychosomatic vision problems were noticed by Gretchen Van
Boemel, an electrophysiolgist at Doheny Eye Institute in Los
Angeles.
   She contacted Rozee-Koker, an old friend, and since then they
identified about 150 Cambodian refugees in Long Beach who claim
blindness or blurred vision although brain wave and eye tests found
nothing physically wrong.
   ``One woman saw her four children and husband killed in front of
her, then lost her vision right after,'' Van Boemel said. ``One
woman watched her husband and three children taken away in 1975.
They never returned. She reported she cried daily for four years,
then she stopped crying and couldn't see.''
   About 15 percent of the women said they were blind _ with no
perception of light _ and the rest claimed varying degrees of
blurry vision, she added.
   At Stanford, Marmor and Dr. Michael Drinnan examined a number of
people with psychosomatic blindness during the last two years.
   ``There were more Southeast Asians with functional vision loss
than other members of society, and almost all seem to be
Cambodians,'' a majority of them women, Marmor said. ``Most had
some perception of light, but they ranged widely over what they
could see. We speculated this may have to do with war trauma.''
   Rozee-Koker and Van Boemel initially interviewed 30 Cambodian
women through an interpreter, and found those with the worst vision
spent the most time living under the Khmer Rouge or in refugee
camps.
   ``The womens' trauma history was extreme,'' Rozee-Koker said.
``They had lost several to all of their relatives. They experienced
beatings, starvation, forced labor, humiliations, separation from
their families.'' She also suspects the women may have been raped.
   Dr. Eric Nelson, an ophthalmology fellow at UCLA's Jules Stein
Eye Institute, said the women's psychosomatic vision problems ``did
seem to happen shortly after they saw some horrendous things, but
they also went through horrendous changes of life'' as refugees.
   Marmor speculated Cambodian refugees may be more prone to
complain of vision trouble because they tend to be uneducated
peasants who experience difficulty adapting to life in a new
country.
   ``To know whether the Cambodian war was the cause of this would
really take some scientific scrutiny, particularly when we have
such a different social situation and culture to understand,'' said
Dr. John Keltner, ophthalmology chairman at the University of
Californa, Davis.
   Since 1977, Keltner and colleagues examined 137 patients who
complained of vision problems but had healthy eyes. They included
Laotian refugees but not Cambodians. Most were faking to obtain
disability payments or awards in lawsuits, Keltner said.
   Nelson studied eight Cambodians to determine if their vision
complaints were sincere.
   ``Some had applied for disability, but some months before their
vision loss,'' he said. ``In five cases, the patients were given a
diagnosis of major depression,'' and two more also probably
suffered it.
   Van Boemel said most of the women she studied also suffered
psychosomatic headaches, dizziness, general malaise and stomach
cramps.
   Rozee-Koker said the women ``sit isolated in their rooms and
live over and over the trauma through horrible nightmares and
intrusive thoughts,'' and their vision problems are worse when they
feel depressed.
   Two years ago, Van Boemel and Rozee-Koker placed five of the
women in group psychotherapy, while five others participated in a
group where they learned survival skills: how to call police, shop
and ride buses.
   After 10 weekly sessions, about three-fifths of the women
reported improved vision and reduced depression, Rozee-Koker said.
   Sulit said some Cambodians get better without treatment. He
refers many to mental health clinics, but ``the system is not there
to help them'' with long-term counseling, he said.
   Blurry vision suffered by Lor Poy, a 54-year-old Cambodian
resident of Long Beach, improved after survival skills training,
Rozee-Koker said.
   Her eyesight worsens when she feels depressed or recalls how the
Khmer Rouge killed her relatives and forced her to look at the
bodies of slaughtered villagers, said Konthea Kang, a Community
Rehabilitation Services program coordinator who led the survival
skills group.
   Poy's case illustrates the difficulty distinguishing hysterical
vision loss from malingering. At a meeting with reporters, she
easily moved through her small apartment and, when asked about
relatives killed by the Khmer Rouge, pointed to their photographs
on a wall 10 feet away.
   An eye disease textbook says that ``ability to move about
without colliding with objects is an outstanding feature of
hysterical blindness.''
   ``People who are faking it have exaggerated behaviors, like
groping the wall, things blind people don't do,'' Rozee-Koker said.
``They are accustomed to their blindness and don't have to grope
the wall.''

<HEAD>Supporters Hope Ethanol Will Clean Up Emissions, Boost Corn Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ethanol _ alcohol squeezed from the United
States' abundant corn supply _ is being injected into diesel bus
engines, turning billows of black exhaust smoke into nearly
invisible white clouds.
   Supporters say the alcohol fuel will reduce air pollution,
extend the life of engines, and raise the price farmers receive for
their corn by boosting demand.
   The first ethanol-diesel buses are rolling through the streets
of Des Moines, Iowa, in the heart of the Cornbelt.
   And dozens of other transit systems _ including Cedar Rapids,
Iowa, and Decatur _ have expressed interest in burning ethanol in
their fleets as they prepare for tougher emission standards.
   ``Our findings could revolutionize the way mass transit systems
are fueled in the future,'' said K. Stephen Spade, general manager
of the Des Moines Metropolitan Transit Authority.
   ``By using ethanol ... we expect to reduce hazardous emissions
by 50 percent while maintaining diesel fuel mileage.''
   The ethanol injector system is manufactured by Midwest Power
Concepts, a Radcliffe, Iowa, company that developed the technology
so farmers could burn ethanol in diesel tractors and combines.
   The test buses have separate fuel systems _ one for diesel fuel
and one for ethanol, MPC President Warren Dobbertin said. The fuels
are not mixed as gasoline and ethanol are blended to create gasohol.
   The buses draw ethanol during high power demand, such as
acceleration, when the greatest pollution would occur with diesel
fuel. At other times, such as cruising speeds, buses switch to
diesel for top economy, Dobbertin said.
   ``You don't have to scrap all the engines that are in place now
as you would with other alternative fuels,'' said Dobbertin. ``We
can do this now, with existing buses, in a few hours.''
   Des Moines will run 17 buses with the ethanol injectors. They
will be tested for pollution from the exhaust pipes and for fuel
mileage.
   Spade said an initial side-by-side test of two buses was
dramatic, with the ethanol bus creating virtually no visible
exhaust.
   ``It's just a white plume versus the big billows of black smoke
we all see when we're driving behind a bus,'' said Martin Andreas,
senior vice president of Archer Daniels Midland Co. in Decatur.
   ADM, a huge grain processor, is the nation's largest ethanol
manufacturer with an annual production capacity of up to 600
million gallons.
   ``Cities are choking to death. It's like D-day and some
decisions have to be made,'' said Andreas. ``The thing that excites
me about diesel is it's a whole new market we've never been able to
get into.''
   Ethanol is expected to replace about 20 percent of the diesel
fuel normally burned in buses, Dobbertin sid. It also allows the
engines to run cooler ``so they live longer,'' he said.
   About 850 million gallons of ethanol were sold last year, almost
all of it blended with gasoline.
   The demand for ethanol could rise as much as 1.58 billion
gallons if 20 percent of the diesel fuel burned in the United
States was replaced by ethanol, supporters say. That would take
about 632 million bushels of corn _ nearly 10 percent of an average
U.S. crop.
   ``The thing that appeals to me is it is very simple. You can put
it on existing engines and you don't have to risk an entirely new
design of engine,'' said Bob Reed, mass transit administrator for
Decatur.
   The City Council has approved a plan to seek $122,000 in federal
funds to equip and test five buses with the ethanol system.
   Andreas said the ethanol used in the buses is 80 proof and is
not nearly as expensive as the 200 proof fuel alcohol blended with
gasoline to make gasohol. He said ethanol in the buses costs about
the same as diesel fuel.
   Dobbertin said conversion of the bus engines with hand-built
injector systems costs about $7,000 each, and takes just two or
three hours. With mass production, he said the cost could be far
less.
   ``By using an environmentally-safe, renewable resource, we can
improve air quality, cut foreign oil imports, stimulate economic
activity and create new demand for the nation's corn crop,''
Dobbertin said.

<HEAD>Doctor Believes Most Chronic Fatigue Suffers Have Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Droopy-eyed and weak, millions of
people visit their doctors every year with a common complaint: They
are tired.
   Doctors at the University of Connecticut Health Center have
discovered that relatively little study has focused on chronic
fatigue, despite interest in the so-called ``yuppie disease,''
chronic fatigue syndrome.
   They decided to help bridge the research gap by establishing a
clinic for patients whose major complaint is chronic fatigue.
   After seeing more than 300 patients over the past three years,
the doctors believe many of the chronically fatigued are suffering
from depression, not chronic fatigue, and can be treated with
anti-depressants and therapy.
   ``There is a great tragedy of saying that chronic fatigue is
viral without a shred of evidence,'' said Dr. Thomas Lane, the
clinic's director. ``Depression and panic disorder are easily
treatable.''
   Contrary to the beliefs of many of their patients, the doctors
believe that few of their clients at the clinic are suffering from
chronic fatigue syndrome.
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta defined the syndrome
as an illness just last year. The CDC says its victims have other
symptoms besides unending tiredness, including headache, sore
throat, fever, weakness, lymph node pain, muscle and joint pains,
memory loss and difficulty concentrating.
   Both the cause and the cure for the syndrome are unknown, but
many doctors believe the root is viral. Several studies have
attempted to link chronic fatigue to the Epstein-Barr virus, which
is related to herpes.
   The mystery surrounding persistent fatigue prompted a fateful
discussion between Lane and his colleagues, Dr. Dale Matthews and
Dr. Peter Manu in 1985.
   ``We compared notes and thought it might be one patient in 10
whose main complaint was chronic fatigue, so we went to the
literature and found it was the fourth most common complaint for
seeing a doctor,'' said Lane, the fatigue clinic's director.
   Fatigue accounts for 10.5 million visits to U.S. doctors each
year, he said.
   ``Research so far has been minimal and even that has been
descriptive,'' Lane said. ``Doctors simply describe the people
they've treated.''
   In November 1986, Lane and his colleagues began asking patients
plagued by fatigue to come to a special clinic. They treated adults
who have not been hospitalized in the past three months and whose
primary complaint is feeling tired at least half the time for at
least the past month.
   Most of the clinic's patients are between 20 and 30 years old.
Women outnumber men two to one. Many come to the clinic convinced
they have chronic fatigue syndrome.
   The physicians complete a medical history of their patients,
give them a physical examination and comprehensive blood tests. The
physicians check for the textbook causes of fatigue: thyroid
problems, viral infections and low blood sugar.
   Patients also must complete a 260-item questionnaire recognized
by the National Institute of Mental Health as an accurate test for
psychiatric diagnoses. Special tests, like sleep studies, are
ordered as needed, Lane said.
   The clinic's findings on 135 patients, published in 1988, showed
that the major causes of fatigue for 67 percent of the patients
were active psychiatric disorders. For 3 percent, medical disorders
were the major causes. Only 6 percent of patients met the CDC
definition of chronic fatigue.
   The major cause of fatigue in the remaining patients was unclear.
   The clinic's findings have gained recognition _ including
publication in prominent medical journals _ and criticism from some
chronic fatigue syndrome sufferers who question the link between
chronic fatigue and depression.
   He prescribes drugs and psychotherapy for patients who are
depressed or suffer panic disorders.
   Jane Packer, 36, of Thomaston said she regained her energy after
accepting Lane's prescriptions.
   Before she saw Lane, she would wake up in the morning and feel
as though she had not slept the night before. She became so
melancholy, she said she would ``cry at the drop of the hat.''
   After tests failed to tell her what was wrong, she wanted to
believe she was suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome.
   ``It's not easy to admit that you're depressed. There's a
stigma,'' she said. ``I think some people with chronic fatigue may
have something (viral) wrong with them, but I think most people are
like me.''

<HEAD>Study Finds Cervical Cap 88 Percent Effective in Preventing Pregnancy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cervical cap is somewhat more effective
in preventing pregnancy than condoms and diaphragms, and two-thirds
of its failures are caused by improper use, according to a study of
3,433 women.
   ``There are a shrinking number of contraceptive options for
women,'' said Dr. Gary Richwald, of the University of California,
Los Angeles. ``The IUD is now recommended for limited use, and
while the pill has a lower failure rate _ 6 percent _ the cap
offers a new, relatively safe form of birth control, with fewer and
less serious side effects than the pill.''
   The UCLA study found about 12 percent of women who use the
cervical cap become pregnant within the first year of use. That
compares with first-year pregnancy risks of 16 percent for the
diaphragm and 14 percent for condoms, according to the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
   Previous studies of the cervical cap's effectiveness found
first-year pregnancy rates ranging from 8 percent to 19 percent.
   Richwald says his eight-year study of 3,433 women who used the
birth control device is the largest, longest and involves patients
of doctors, nurses and midwives, ``which allows for greater
generalization of the findings.''
   About 70,000 women use the cervical cap, which is a small rubber
cup that fits over the cervix, or uterine opening, and stays in
place by suction. It was approved for widespread use in May 1988 by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which said the cap should be
used with spermicide and worn for no more than 48 hours.
   Some studies have suggested the cap can induce precancerous
cervical abnormalities reflected by abnormal Pap smear results.
Richwald found few such changes but noted further studies are
needed to clarify the risk.
   Two-thirds of pregnancies among cap users were due to improper
use rather than failure of the cap itself, UCLA said in a news
release. A statement by the ACOG said the risk of pregnancy was
only 6 percent among ``near perfect'' cap users who never had
unprotected sex and always used spermicide in the cap.
   The study was published in the August issue of the journal
Obstetrics and Gynecology.

<HEAD>Acupuncture Kills Pain in Different Way Than Analgesic Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When acupuncture prevents pain, it doesn't
act on the same parts of the nervous system as painkilling drugs,
say scientists who studied patients undergoing surgery in China.
   ``Most anesthetic agents will change brain waves and alter how
nerve fibers conduct impulses, and one can measure these changes.
Acupuncture works by other mechanisms we currently have no way of
measuring,'' said Dr. Arnold Starr, of the University of
California, Irvine, College of Medicine.
   Starr, a neurology professor, and his colleagues visited
Hangzhou, China, to measure brain waves, nerve impulse conduction
and ability to perform tasks such as recognizing musical tones in
five patients undergoing surgery for removal of thyroid tumors one
to two inches in size.
   Acupuncture needles were inserted 20 minutes before surgery, and
the acupuncture points were restimulated during the operations, but
the patients remained alert and able to speak.
   They also received very small doses of painkilling drugs and a
muscle relaxant. Starr said the drugs alone would be inadequate to
block the pain of surgery, but may work in concert with acupuncture
to alter how the patients perceived pain.
   The patients' brain, nerve and sensory activity remained
unchanged during surgery, even though they felt no pain, Starr and
colleagues reported in September's issue of the journal Archives of
Neurology.
   The findings suggest acupuncture acts on the body's system of
endorphins, which are chemicals that bind to parts of the nervous
system to reduce the perception of pain, Starr said.

<HEAD>Mayo Lauds Hip Replacement Device as Improvement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trials of the first 30 hip replacement
devices designed at the Mayo Clinic show they are less painful to
their recipients and less likely to fail than today's standard
devices, a Mayo physician says.
   The new design is ``dramatically different'' from other implant
devices on the market, said Dr. Bernard Morrey, professor and
chairman of Mayo's Department of Orthopedics.
   Primarily, it is shorter than traditional devices and the
double-wedged, tapered design allows it to be affixed to the bone
without cement. It is less invasive and less of the patient's bone
must be removed to implant it _ important factors in case the
device must be replaced, he said.
   Mayo Clinic has performed about 20,000 hip replacements in the
last 20 years. In recent years, however, about one-third have been
second-time replacements because an earlier device failed.
   Morrey, a specialist in adult reconstructive surgery, has been
the only surgeon using the new device. Other Mayo physicians will
begin implanting it and if it proves successful, the device could
be widely available in about a year if the results continue to
prove successful.
   A Mayo team began designing the device in the early 1980s
because of the need for an implant that could be affixed to the
bone without relying on cement.
   Although cemented implants are successful with older patients,
they tend to crack and fail in more active people. When the cement
cracks, the implant loosens and the surgery must be redone.
   Initially, specialists thought an implant would need to be
large, with a large surface area, to be affixed without cement,
Morrey said.
   But there was concern the body would produce an adverse
biological or biomechanical response, he said. In fact, early
evidence suggested that bones could dissolve because the stress
they needed to be viable was taken by the implant instead.
   Mayo Clinic specialists designed the short-stem implant with a
working part of about three inches, about half the length of the
traditional device. Because of its shorter length, the bone
receives the stress it needs to avoid dissolving.
   The shorter length could explain why people don't have the thigh
pain that affects about one in 10 people with non-cemented
implants, Morrey said. Although the pain usually subsides in a
year, it can compromise the success of implants that otherwise look
perfect.
   The implement was designed to be easy to manufacture in hopes of
keeping costs down, Morrey said. The same implant can be used in
the right hip or the left hip so medical facilities can keep their
inventory low.

<HEAD>Retailers Enjoy A Good September, But Some Trouble Spots Persist</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest retailers reported mixed September sales
results as Americans spent freely on clothing last month but
hesitated about expensive items like home appliances.
   Retailers who depend on apparel for much of their business said
Thursday they had strong sales gains, but other stores, including
the nation's biggest retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., did not fare
as well.
   Overall, sales ``were pretty good ... better than we would have
expected,'' said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail industry analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Apparel retailers got a boost when cooler weather in many areas
sent consumers in search of warmer clothing during the last week to
10 days of September, analysts said.
   But sales of more expensive durable goods, which include items
such as home appliances, continued slumping because consumers were
still juggling high amounts of installment debt, said Jeffrey
Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Analysts said this trend was most noticeable in the performance
of Sears. The company reported its overall sales rose 0.4 percent
when compared with September 1988, but declined 1.8 percent at
stores open at least a year, known in the industry as same-store or
comparable-store sales.
   Retailers and analysts consider same-store sales a more accurate
reflection of a company's performance than totals that include
sales at recently opened stores.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer, has been unable to
overcome a severe sales slump despite a new ``everyday-low-price''
and merchandising strategy.
   Other mass merchandisers and discount retailers fared better.
   K mart Corp. said its overall September sales increased 6.1
percent, while same-store sales were up 3 percent.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its overall sales were up 31 percent
in September, and same-store sales rose 16 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. said its overall September sales rose 11.7
percent, while same-store sales increased 10.7 percent.
   May Department Stores Inc., whose department store chains are
heavily dependent on apparel sales, said its overall results rose
8.9 percent last month as same-store sales rose 6.5 percent.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
said its September sales increased 10 percent overall and 6 percent
on a same-store basis.
   Feiner, the Merrill Lynch analyst, described consumers as
``muddling along,'' but Drexel's Edelman was more upbeat.
   ``The consumer's willing to spend,'' he said. ``Spending will be
maintained at a fairly decent pace.''
   The retailers are moving into the most critical part of the
year. In the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping
season, they typically make half their annual profits.
   Economists also will be watching sales in the final quarter of
the year as a barometer of how the economy is faring. Consumer
spending, which includes retail sales, accounts for two-thirds of
the gross national product.
   Analysts warned that when October's sales figures are in, they
may not look as rosy because they will be compared with the strong
performance of October 1988, when the apparel industry began its
recovery from a yearlong slide.
   The figures reported Thursday were from major general
merchandise chains and apparel retailers. The government's monthly
retail sales report is more comprehensive, including sales at auto
dealers, supermarkets, restaurants and elsewhere.
   In other reports:
   _Dayton Hudson Corp. said its overall sales were up 16.4 percent
in September, while same-store sales increased 8.6 percent.
   _Woolworth Corp. said overall sales rose 8.5 percent last month
and same-store sales were up 3.9 percent.
   _Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. reported its sales rose 1 percent in
September. The company did not release same-store results.

<TEXT>
   Robert L. Crandall sits at the top of the nation's
largest airline, a tough-minded executive whose goal is to make AMR
Corp. a survivor in deregulated skies.
   ``Some people see him as the kind of man who might step over his
grandmother to get to a business deal that will be good for
American Airlines,'' one unnamed former executive told the Dallas
Times Herald in a 1982 interview.
   ``But he's honest, and that's what make him the most respected
man in the business,'' said the executive.
   Crandall also is usually included on lists of the airline
industry's top executives.
   The 53-year-old chairman, president and chief executive of AMR
is in many ways the antithesis of Donald Trump, the flashy, New
York billionaire who has proposed a $7 billion buyout of AMR.
   Trump is an active member of New York society and attaches his
name to most of his holdings, from the Trump Shuttle, the airline
he bought from Eastern Airlines, to the Trump Princess, his private
yacht.
   Crandall is a much more private man, unaccustomed to giving
interviews. He is, however, blunt.
   ``You must remember that Bob Crandall doesn't bluff,'' says one
industry analyst. ``He threatens, but he doesn't bluff.''
   Trump himself has high praise for Crandall, saying the buyout
proposal ``reflects the enormous respect that I have for the
company, its management team and the company's employees.''
   The bid comes at a time when Crandall has been anticipating
expanding American's 21.8 percent share of the domestic market.
   ``Crandall is licking his chops to get at United and some of his
more leveraged competitors,'' said Kevin Burke, an analyst for
First Union Corp., a bank holding company in Charlotte, N.C.
   UAL Corp., parent of former number one carrier United Airlines,
is undergoing a $6.75 billion buyout by employees and management.
   ``He's an airline builder,'' Burke said of Crandall. ``By
building the best and largest airline in the U.S., he wants to be
one of the global survivors in what has been a cut-throat
industry.''
   Crandall took over as chairman and chief executive of AMR and
American Airlines Inc. on March 1, 1985, adding to his duties as
president, which he had held since 1980. He has been on American's
board since 1976.
   He joined American in 1973 as senior vice president-finance and
a year later was named senior vice president-marketing.
   As head of marketing, Crandall helped institute American's Super
Saver and frequent flier fare structures, its shift to hub
operations and creation of SABRE, the computerized reservation
system now considered one of the airline's key assets.
   Prior to coming to American, he spent six years at TWA,
including stints as vice president of data services and vice
president and controller.
   Before that, he worked at Eastman Kodak, Co., Hallmark Cards and
Bloomingdale's Department Stores in New York.
   He is a native of Westerly, R.I., and is a 1957 graduate of the
University of Rhode Island, with a master's degree in business
administration from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

<HEAD>Trump Has History of Takeover Feints</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a high-stakes baccarat player at one of his
Atlantic City casinos, real estate tycoon Donald Trump has made
some profitable bluffs to help bankroll his ambitious and splashy
acquisitions.
   ``I keep a lot of balls in the air, because most deals fall out,
no matter how promising they seem at first,'' Trump says in his
best-selling book, ``The Art of the Deal.''
   His shrewd acquisitions have expanded his empire of
hotel-casinos and prime Manhattan real estate. Most recently, Trump
purchased Eastern Airlines' lucrative Northeast shuttle service for
$365 million in early June, pledging to turn it into ``an absolute
diamond.''
   In July 1987, Trump took control of Resorts International Inc.,
a New Jersey gaming and real estate company he won in a takeover
battle. He sold Resorts last year to entertainer Merv Griffin.
   Trump has added other jewels to his crown: New York's landmark
Plaza Hotel and the Trump Tower apartment-retail-office complex,
the Trump Plaza apartment tower, several casinos in Atlantic City,
N.J., and the Bahamas, buildings in West Palm Beach, Fla.m and
undeveloped land holdings.
   But not all his deals have ended up by putting properties in his
hands. Trump also has made takeover feints at Golden Nugget Inc.,
Pan Am Corp. and United Airlines parent Allegis Corp., now called
UAL Corp.
   In each case, he accumulated shares in the company _ sometimes
indicating he might be interested in mounting a buyout _ and later
sold all or some of his shares at a profit after the price rose on
the ensuing takeover speculation or when another bidder emerged.
   With Allegis, for example, Trump is believed to have paid about
$50 a share for his 4.9 percent stake, which exceeded 2.5 million
shares. He later reportedly sold them at nearly $74, netting around
$80 million on the deal.
   Trump also sought and received federal antitrust clearance to
buy up to 15 percent of Federated Department Stores Inc.'s shares
in 1988, although he never made a buyout offer. He is estimated to
have netted $100 million on his investment in Federated, which he
made two weeks before Canadian retailer Campeau Corp. launched a
hostile, and ultimately successful, bid.
   In Trump's latest move, a $7 billion buyout proposal for AMR
Corp., parent of American Airlines, his strategy is different. He
came out openly with an outright buyout proposal in a letter to AMR
Chairman Robert L. Crandall, offering to pay $120 a share in cash
in a deal that would be the biggest airline buyout ever.
   Trump's track record of making runs at companies has made some
financial analysts wary of his intentions concerning AMR.
   ``I'm very skeptical of everything this man does,'' said Andrew
Geller, an airline analyst at Provident National Bank in
Philadelphia. ``He wants to put (AMR) in play and make profits from
it.''
   Wall Street showed its skepticism. AMR stock closed Thursday at
$99.87{ a share in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, up
sharply from $83 on Wednesday but well below Trump's bid of $120.
   Trump is believed to have discreetly snapped up AMR shares in
recent weeks, keeping his holding below 5 percent of AMR's total
outstanding shares, the level at which a stake must be reported to
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Observers speculated
Thursday that the developer paid $70 to $80 a share _ allowing him
a tidy profit if he sells out.
   Still, his reputation could be on the line. Because he's made
his buyout intentions official this time, Trump has to be prepared
to have his bluff called by AMR or this could be ``his last deal,''
Geller suggested.
   Trump insists he's not in it for the money, except as a ``way to
keep score.''
   ``The real excitement is playing the game,'' he says.

   A Senate committee has approved legislation
that would broaden the authority of the Secretary of Transportation
over debt-financed buyouts of airlines.
   The legislation, approved Thursday by the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, will prevent any buyer from
acquiring 25 percent or more of an airline without prior approval
of the secretary.
   The bill would require the secretary to certify that the deal
would not damage the airline's ability to operate or to expand its
business.
   ``The Congress must send a strong message that highly leveraged
buyouts are not tolerable,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., who
with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., sponsored the legislation. ``The
safety and efficiency of our aviation system is a public trust.
   ``I don't want to wake up when all U.S. carriers have been
leveraged and bought out, when foreign interests are manipulating
our markets, to decide that something should be done to regulate
the buying and selling of major parts of our transportation
network.''
   The bill now goes to the full Senate. A House aviation
subcommittee is examining different legislation to address the
issue.
   On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told
Ford's aviation subcommittee that his work in the proposed
Northwest Airlines takeover would have been easier had be been
given the opportunity to approve the transaction in advance.
   The department forced a modification of the takeover last week,
getting the Dutch airline, KLM, to reduce its investment in and
influence over the new company. The transaction had been announced
in June.
   But Skinner said he didn't necessarily favor new legislation to
deal with acquisitions in the airline.
   Current law restricts foreign ownership of airlines to 25
percent of the stock. Although it requires the department to
approve changes of ownership, advance approval is not required.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Sas Trade Deficit Still Shrinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher says the
U.S. trade deficit is likely to shrink to between $100 billion and
$110 billion this year, with Japan accounting for about half of
that imbalance.
   Through the first seven months of the year, the trade deficit
has been running at an annual rate of $105.8 billion, down 11
percent from the 1988 deficit of $118.5 billion.
   The trade deficit for this year is improving at exactly half the
pace of last year, when the gap between imports and exports fell by
22 percent, down from a record $152.12 billion in 1987.
   Mosbacher predicted Thursday that the deficit with Japan would
total $50 billion this year, meaning that one country will account
for about half of the total deficit.
   The huge imbalance in Japanese trade makes that country ``our
prime target'' in administration efforts to lower the imbalance,
Mosbacher said in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   In a separate congressional appearance, U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills was also blunt about the need for Japan
to do more to open its markets.
   ``Japan is an economic superpower, but they must contribute to
the system and not just take from it,'' Hills said. She said this
is the message she will convey next week during a round of trade
discussions in Tokyo.

<HEAD>American Companies Lag in Using Government Research, Testimony Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and European corporations know better
than American ones how to take advantage of what is being produced
in U.S. government-funded laboratories, witnesses told a House
subcommittee.
   ``The Japanese are not picking our pockets, the Europeans are
not picking our pockets, they're picking it off the table,'' said
attorney Robert H. Brumley, former general counsel in the Commerce
Department.
   Brumley testified at a hearing Thursday of the House Small
Business subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and
energy. The Washington-based attorney said government officials are
ignorant of the laws encouraging the private use of
government-developed technology.
   ``It's not understood as a matter of public policy,'' he said.
``It's that simple.''
   He said that ignorance had to be overcome before his office
could make sure the international agreement on the space station
protected the rights of U.S. contractors and subcontractors when
foreign partners begin to take commercial advantage of developments
from the project.
   In the meantime, witnesses said, the information is caught up in
red tape or inertia, too often classified in the United States but
available abroad or _ just the opposite _ reports on inventions are
disseminated before companies can bid on them.
   The subcommittee staff is exploring the effectiveness of the
Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and previous legislation in
encouraging the private use of government-developed technology.
   The act, combined with an executive order in 1987, allows
federal laboratories to enter into cooperative research and
development agreements with the private sector and provides for
royalty sharing by government scientists.
   White House adviser D. Allan Bromley said there were 200 such
agreements now.
   Critics say the act is too soft in its language, doing too
little to encourage active leadership. All witnesses said that
leadership was necessary for technology transfer to get anywhere.
   The government spends more than $60 billion a year on research
in 700 laboratories, 47 percent of the research and development
expenditures in this country, according to the subcommittee
research.
   From the Army Corps of Engineers, to the Department of Energy to
NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the Agriculture
Department, the government-financed laboratory produces a weath of
materials that can be used in medicine, construction and
manufacturing.
   However, licensing payments to federal researchers and
institutions totaled less than $4 million last year, said Rep. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Bromley told the subcommittee he was committed to improving
technology transfer and, under prodding by Wyden, said his
technology blueprint for the nation, to be released early this
year, would contain a section on the subject.
   He also said he was creating an industrial technology section in
his Office of Science and Technology Policy. He said he has
selected a person for that position and President Bush would be
announcing the appointment.
   The office would be in charge of competitiveness issues,
including technology transfers, he said.
   ``There are some very bright spots in the system,'' he said,
``But I certainly agree with you that we have a long way to go.''

<HEAD>Icahn Raises Stake in USX, Says Takeover Bid Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Carl Icahn says he is studying the
feasibility of making a bid for USX Corp. after buying an
additional 4.25 million shares of the steel and oil giant.
   His purchase of $155 million worth of shares this week raised
his stake in the Pittsburgh-based company to 13.06 percent from
11.41 percent.
   Icahn said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Thursday that a group led by him wants to explore a
``meaningful restructuring that would substantially enhance
shareholder value.''
   Icahn, who owns Trans World Airlines Inc., said his group was
considering making proposals for ``business combinations'' with
USX, a phrase that a source close to Icahn said meant the investor
was considering a friendly takeover offer.
   Icahn's filing said he was discussing the feasibility of a deal
with USX in combination with other possible participants and
sources of financing. He said he also was considering asking other
shareholders to elect nominees proposed by Icahn to the USX board
of directors.
   Icahn reserved the right to sell his USX shares, but said he was
not interested in selling them back to the company at a premium _ a
practice known as accepting ``greenmail.''
   The relevant pages of Icahn's filing with the SEC were supplied
to some reporters late Thursday, after the stock market closed, by
Steven Rubin, a lawyer for Icahn in New York.
   USX shares fell 37{ cents to close at $38.37{ Thursday in New
York Stock Exchange trading after surging over the last several
days on rumors that Icahn might be making another move with his
stake in the company.
   The stock rose $1.75 to $34.87{ on Monday, when USX announced it
is offering to sell natural gas and oil reserves that analysts say
could bring about $1.5 billion.
   The stock rose $1.37{ to $36.25 the next day amid talk that
Icahn was buying additional shares, and it surged $2.75 Wednesday
to $38.75. He acquired his additional shares Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Icahn, who won a takeover battle for TWA and sold a stake in
Texaco Inc. for $2 billion, bought his USX stock at prices believed
to average in the low $20s. He once suggested a buyout at $31 a
share, or around $7 billion, but never made a tender offer.
   The United Steelworkers union, meanwhile, requested Thursday
that USX reopen its existing labor agreement to restore sacrifices
granted by members in the 1982-83 and 1986-87 rounds of bargaining.
   USW local presidents met in Pittsburgh on Wednesday and Thursday
to discuss the proposal, which was overwhelmingly approved. The
presidents represent about 18,500 steelworkers.
   The Steelworkers current master agreement expires Jan. 31, 1991.
   ``A new and improved pattern of compensation now prevails in the
steel industry as a result of the current round of collective
bargaining,'' USW President Lynn Williams wrote in a letter to USX
Chief Executive Officer Charles Corry. ``Similar improvements have
been made throughout American industry during recent months.
   ``USX employees and retirees are certainly no less deserving
than other steelworkers and those who work in other industries,''
he said.
   Also Thursday, USX said it filed a lawsuit accusing Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. of deception when it sold the steelmaker $24
million in short-term commercial paper issued by financially
troubled Integrated Resources Inc.
   USX contends in the civil complaint filed Tuesday in U.S.
District Court that as underwriter of the paper, Drexel withheld
information about problems at Integrated, which defaulted on its
debt shortly after the USX purchases.
   Integrated, a former high-flying real estate and insurance
concern, on June 9 defaulted on $955 million in short-term
obligations and declared a moratorium on all debt payments while it
restructured.
   ``We have not yet seen the complaint. We believe we have
fulfilled our obligation to purchasers of Integrated's commercial
paper,'' Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said Thursday.

   The manufacturer of a rattle said it was
voluntarily recalling the toy because it could present a choking,
breathing or eating hazard to small children.
   The rattles may be broken in use and expose small parts which
could be eaten or swallowed by small children and cause them to
choke, said a statement Thursday from the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
   Some 60,000 of the rattles which have a center section shaped as
a bear's face, butterfly, ball or train engine were sold nationwide
through J.C. Penney stores.
   The toymaker, Lousiana-based Mini-Togs, Inc., said the rattles
were distributed with two baby bibs but the recall involves only
``Baby Bib'' model 200.
   No choking incidents have been reported, but consumers should
immediately return the rattles for $1 refunds from the stores where
they were purchased, the safety commission said.

<TEXT>
   Europe's interest rate increases were greater than
the financial markets expected, and some critics warned they might
do the job too well, slowing economic growth too much.
   Britain is the most vulnerable nation to economic and political
repercussions from the decision Thursday by European governments to
raise their interest rates to combat inflation and stabilize their
currencies.
   The upward move was led by West Germany, which raised its key
rates an unexpected full percentage point.
   The British government responded by raising rates a full point
as well, to 15 percent, their highest in nearly eight years. It was
a politically risky move to defend the pound.
   Other European central banks, including those of France,
Switzerland, and Austria, moved their rates up as well to ease
downward pressure on their currencies and keep them within trading
ranges imposed by the European Monetary System, which links the
currencies of most Common Market nations in order to minimize rate
swings. Britain doesn't participate.
   The dollar finished higher anyway on Thursday, but European
stock markets were unsettled.
   The dollar closed at 1.8845 West German marks, up from 1.8770
marks on Wednesday, and the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index of the British exchange fell 30.5 points, or 1.3
percent, to close at 2,281.6.
   The previous tandem interest rate increase took place in late
June. The markets had been watching a Thursday meeting of the West
German central bank's council for a possible rise, but many were
stunned by its size.
   The increases ``could be dangerous to the economy and could be
too high,'' said Peter Pietsch, an economist with Commerzbank in
Frankfurt.
   John Banham, director-general of the Confederation of British
Industry, called them ``wholly unnecessary.''
   ``High interest rates have done their job by curbing overheating
in the economy, and this further rise will be counterproductive,''
he said.
   British lawmaker John Smith, the opposition Labor Party's
spokesman on trade, said: ``This is appalling news. For millions of
mortgage payers and for businesses all over Britain living costs
will rise and investment will become even more expensive.''
   The Bundesbank raised its discount rate, the rate at which a
commercial bank can borrow funds from the central bank, from 5
percent to 6 percent and pushed up its Lombard rate from 7 percent
to 8 percent.
   The Lombard rate is the rate at which the central bank lends
funds using securities as collateral.
   The last time the Bundesbank raised key rates by more than half
a point was in February 1980.
   The West German government bank said the increases were designed
``to combat continued inflationary danger resulting from an
exuberant economy.'' It also said they were aimed at stabilizing
the mark.
   West Germany's economy is growing at a rate of 4.5 percent
compared with the previous 2 percent, and inflation is at 3
percent, said David Morrison, an economist at Goldman Sachs
International Corp. in London.
   He speculated that West Germany wanted to get interest rate
increases out of the way well before a 1990 national election.
   ``This probably reflects a peak for interest rates,'' he said.
   But British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the
Cabinet member responsible for national finances, said on British
Broadcasting Corp. television that he couldn't promise that
Britain's rates wouldn't go even higher.
   Soon after the German move, the Bank of England signaled the
full percentage point increase in the British commercial banks'
base rates to the 15 percent level, the 11th increase since June
1988, when rates stood at a decade low of 7.5 percent.
   Britain has the highest interest rates among the major Western
democracies.
   Britain's Treasury said the European rate hikes reflected ``a
general concern to take no risks on inflation.''
   Lawson told BBC radio that with his Conservative Party opening
its annual convention Monday, the increase was ``extremely
awkward.'' But he said, ``It's necessary to do the right thing.''
   British markets had expected a rate increase since poor trade
figures were announced last week, pressuring the pound. The Bank of
England has since intervened in currency trading repeatedly to
support the pound.
   Lawson has maintained that a strong pound is essential to the
government's fight against inflation, whose annual rate stood at
7.3 percent in August, down from 8.2 percent in July but more than
double the 3.3 percent in January 1988.

<HEAD>Dollar Rising In Calm Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in Europe early today, stunning
the markets with its resilience against higher European interest
rates. Trading was calm.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   West Germany's central bank led the interest rate increase on
Thursday by pushing up its key interest rates a full percentage
point. The central banks of Britain, France, Switzerland and other
European countries responded by raising their rates as well.
   The move was designed to curb inflation and steady their
currencies, but it failed to weaken the dollar.
   The market was waiting for the release of U.S. employment
figures for September, which were expected to show a flat jobless
rate of 5.2 percent and a rise in non-farm payrolls of 279,000.
   Strong job data could provide the dollar with the momentum to
rise further, a U.S. dealer in Frankfurt said.
   In Tokyo, where the dollar began its day, the U.S. currency rose
1.40 yen to 142.45 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted higher at
142.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.8885 West German marks, up from 1.8845; 1.6405
Swiss francs, up from 1.6365; 6.3965 French francs, up from 6.3900;
2.1351 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1200; 1,382.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,380.25; and 1.1780 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1746.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6060 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6100 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $363.40 a troy ounce,
down from late Thursday's $365. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $363.60.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $363.60, down from $364.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.91 to close at a bid $364.20.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.16 a troy
ounce, down from Thursday's $5.27.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen today,
while share prices closed broadly lower on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar ended the week at 142.45 yen, up 1.40 yen from
Thursday's close of 141.05 yen. It opened at 141.95 yen, and traded
between 141.80 yen and 142.75 yen.
   Volume totaled $9.483 billion, down from Thursday's $10.358
billion.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 140.19-point
gainer Thursday, shed 313.64 points, or 0.88 percent, closing the
week at 35,209.35.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 700 million
shares, compared to Thursday's 900 million.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's strength to an upswing
in overseas markets Thursday despite interest rate hikes by West
European central banks. Higher interest rates are supposed to
support a currency against other currencies.
   Earlier Thursday, the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank,
raised its key lending rates by 1 percentage point, including the
official discount rate, to 6 percent annually. The measure was
aimed at curbing the dollar's strength in order to help stem
inflationary pressures in West Germany.
   Central banks in Britain, France and other European nations
followed with similar measures Thursday.
   Masaaki Tanahashi, a dealer with Mitsui Bank, said Japan's
central bank intervened selling many millions of dollars, but said
``the intervention helped little'' to stop the dollar's upward
pressure.
   The Bank of Japan does not comment on its monetary activities.
   Tanahashi said the market is awaiting U.S. umemployment figures
for September, due out later today in Washington, as a factor in
finding the dollar's direction.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto meanwhile told a news
conference today Japan will watch carefully for any impact from the
raise in West European interest rates. He added, however, ``We are
not considering any change in our monetary policy'' for now.
   On the stock market, the market's main barometer fell following
three bullish sessions this week apparently due to the higher West
European interest rates.
   They said concern over the upcoming jobless rate was another
factor that sent many investors to the sidelines.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. will form
what apparently is the first joint manufacturing venture among the
nation's Big Three automakers, building manual transmissions at two
plants.
   GM and Chrysler said in a joint statement Thursday that the
project would involve plants in Muncie, Ind., and Syracuse, N.Y.,
and supply transmissions for a wide range of cars and trucks sold
by both companies.
   In the past, the Big Three have supplied parts to each other,
but representatives for all three said they were not aware of any
common manufacturing projects.
   Chrysler's Acustar subsidiary will own 64 percent of the
yet-to-be-named company and GM will own the rest, the announcement
said. Neither company would disclose financial terms of the joint
venture.
   The deal is in the form of a letter of intent and must be
approved by federal officials. The joint venture could be in place
by Jan. 1, the statement said.
   One antitrust expert said the deal, which must be approved by
the Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Justice Department, may
face close scrutiny.
   ``I am certain the companies will argue that it is a very
limited arrangement,'' said law Professor Martin Adelman of Wayne
State University in Detroit. ``But if they start with a small joint
venture, how do you know the companies won't talk about other
arrangements?''
   Ford Motor Co. spokesman Tom Foote said his company did not have
immediate comment on the deal. ``We have to learn more about it,''
he said.
   GM spokesman John Hartnett said he expects the federal
government to consider the antitrust implications of the deal later
this year. He said he did not anticipate any problems.
   Hartnett and Chrysler spokesman James Kenyon said GM's Muncie
plant was not being used to its capacity while Chrysler's Syracuse
plant had too much work.
   Neither company would give the production levels of either
plant. The 2,700 workers at the Syracuse plant and the 1,400 at
Muncie factory should be unaffected, Hartnett and Kenyon said.
   ``Muncie is under-utilized to a degree and this could add
employment,'' Hartnett said.
   Transmissions from the two plants will go to a variety of GM and
Chrysler cars, trucks, minivans and Jeeps with manual
transmissions. Profits or losses generated by the plants will be
shared in the same proportion as the ownership.
   GM President Robert Stempel said the venture would enhance
efficiency at both plants.
   ``This ... alliance is a win-win situation that means greater
job security for both facilities,'' Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald
Greenwald said.
   Engineers from GM, Ford and Chrysler are involved in a joint
project looking into uses of plastics for cars and trucks of the
future.

<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. apologized to Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney for any delays stemming from the strike by 57,800
machinists, and supervisors worked to complete jetliners nearly
ready for delivery.
   Striking machinists, the biggest group of production workers at
the world's largest aerospace company, continued to press their
claim for a larger share of the company's profits on the picket
lines.
   ``I would just like to see things a little more fair,'' Fred
Mayo, a mechanic at Boeing's Everett plant, said Thursday night on
the picket line. ``The company did have a record year last year.''
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet builder with 65
percent of the free world's market, is in its fifth consecutive
year of record jetliner orders with a backlog worth $80 billion.
   The strike went into its third day today with no new
negotiations scheduled.
   Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said company officials met
Wednesday to discuss the strike but he knew of no further meetings
Thursday.
   ``The company is mute,'' said union spokesman Jack Daniels.
``They're doing their aristocratic aloof act.''
   The machinists' union is seeking a larger share of Boeing's
prosperity and fewer hours of mandatory overtime. Union members'
current wages range from $8.88 to $18.42 an hour. Wage rates
haven't been increased for six years, although Boeing has paid
bonuses.
   The union rejected an offer of an immediate raise of 4 percent
with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8
percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the
next, plus a reduction in mandatory overtime to 160 hours a quarter
from 200 hours.
   ``I have a family, and on the average, I work 12-hour days,
usually six or seven days a week,'' Mayo said. ``I don't want to
wake up one day and discover that I've missed seeing my 2-year-old
son grow up.''
   Chairman Frank Shrontz sent Cheney a telegram Thursday
apologizing for any delays in delivery because of the strike and
assuring that Boeing ``will do all it can to resolve this issue at
the earliest possible time.''
   Boeing receives billions of dollars of defense contracts a year
that range from work on the B-2 stealth bomber to guided missile
systems and avionic research.
   ``We hope the strike will be short-lived,'' the telegram said.
   Company spokesman Jack Gamble said about 40 planes were in the
final assembly or test stages at Everett and Renton that probably
could be completed during the strike. Before the strike, Boeing was
producing about 30 planes a month.
   ``We've been working on a couple of airplanes, and that's it so
far,'' Gamble said. ``The first couple of days are spent figuring
out who you've got available in what discipline.''
   Many of the replacement workers do not have the airframe and
power plant licenses required for many assembly tasks, he said.
   Members of other Boeing unions, which have no-strike clauses in
their contracts, have been reporting to work. Worldwide, Boeing
employs 164,000 people, including 106,000 in western Washington.
   Bret Bertolin, a specialist with the state office of the
forecast council, said the state agency estimated a monthlong
strike would mean $160 million in lost payroll, and $15 million in
lost state revenues.
   If it drags on, other industries would be affected and the
payroll loss would rise to $240 million in a second month, $320
million in a third and $400 million in a fourth, he estimated.
   Industry analysts said the strike's outcome could set a trend
for contracts at other aerospace companies.
   Talks have been extended after a machinists' contract expired
Sunday at Lockheed Corp. in Marietta, Ga., and the union's contract
with McDonnell Douglas, Boeing's only U.S. competitor for
jetliners, is up Oct. 22.

   The stock market headed higher today, responding
to new evidence of sluggish economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 10.82 points to
2,784.38 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading

519 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 59.50 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point in
September to 5.3 percent.
   The data also showed an increase of 209,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, well short of advance estimates on Wall Street in the
range of 275,000 to 300,000.
   Analysts said traders interpreted the report as a fresh signal
that the economy was making only sluggish progress.
   The widespread inference from that, brokers said, was that
chances were improving for a further easing of the Federal
Reserve's credit policy sooner or later.
   USX led the active list, up 1 at 39]. Late Thursday Carl Icahn
disclosed that he had raised his stake in USX, confirming recent

   National Education tumbled 3| to 8]. On Thursday the company

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc., a week after filing for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has announced more discount air
fares in a bid to lure passengers.
   Orlando-based Braniff said Thursday it was offering one-way
fares ranging from $29 to $189 on most of its regional flights and
transcontinental fares from $99 to $199.
   Until Oct. 16, Braniff will continue offering $99 one-way fares
as part of a promotion as it reorganizes.
   Beginning Oct. 16, the airline will offer three fare levels,
including three- and seven-day advance-purchase schemes, as well as
a Y Special fare requiring no advance purchase.
   ``Our fare structure will be easy for the consumer to
understand, easy for the travel agent to book and easy for Braniff
to process,'' said Tom Volz, the airline's senior vice president
for marketing.
   Under the new fare program, all tickets purchased under all
three fare schemes can be booked up to 331 days in advance of
travel dates. All fares will be locked in at the new prices,
Braniff said.
   Fares under the seven-day advance plan will be $99 one way _
when purchased on a round-trip basis between any two cities served
by Braniff, except Chicago and Phoenix, Ariz.
   Fares to those two cities are lower, the airline said.
   Braniff said only a limited number of seats will be available on
each flight under the seven-day advance-purchase plan.
   Braniff also will offer a three-day advance-purchase fare of
$109 one way on nonstop flights between Kansas City, Mo., and New
York; Newark, N.J.; Washington, D.C.; Orlando; Dallas-Fort Worth,
Texas; San Diego, Calif.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco.
   The fare for flights between any other two cities in the Braniff
network purchased under the three-day advance plan will be $139 one
way.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly

harvest-related selling.
   ``We should have real good harvest progress this week,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., citing

<TEXT>
   The nation's civilian unemployment rate edged
up one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.3 percent in September as
manufacturing payrolls shrank by more than 100,000 jobs, the
government said today.
   The unemployment rate was up from 5.2 percent in both July and
August, the Labor Department said in the first comprehensive look
at the economy last month.
   The report was weaker than many analysts had expected even
though payroll declines at factories were offset by gains from
teachers returning to their classrooms and telephone workers ending
a strike.
   ``This report is the first in quite a while that suggests the
economy could be heading for a tailspin,'' said economist Allen
Sinai of the Boston Co. ``The report was quite soft ... with meager
employment gains. Where there were big gains ... they are explained
away by special factors.''
   Reacting to the data, the stock market rallied in early trading.
Brokers took sluggish job growth as a sign that the Federal Reserve
Board has more leeway to lower interest rates. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials rose 11.96 to 2,785.52 in the first
half-hour of trading.
   ``The Federal Reserve Board has put more than 100,000 Americans
out of work since March,'' charged economist Richard Rahn of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``The September rise in unemployment is
the direct result of the Fed-induced economic slowdown.''
   The unemployment rate for adult men jumped to 4.8 percent last
month from 4.4 percent in August, while the rate for women fell to
4.5 percent from 4.7 percent a month earlier.
   The jobless rate is derived from a survey of American
households. A separate survey of employers showed that the economy
added 209,000 non-farm payroll jobs in September, bringing the
total to a seasonally adjusted 109.1 million. August job growth was
only 88,000, revised down from a previous estimate of 110,000.
   September growth was artificially bolstered by the return of
75,000 striking telephone workers. In the household survey,
strikers are counted as employed, so their return did not affect
the unemployment rate.
   The department said more industries lost than gained jobs in
September. Goods-producing industries, representing about
one-fourth of the economy, was particularly hard hit, losing
108,000 jobs.
   Most of the loss was to manufacturing payrolls, which have been
declining since the spring and lost 103,000 workers in September _
33,000 of them in the auto industry. Thirty of 31 manufacturing
industries showed declines or were unchanged.
   Construction payrolls were unchanged last month while mining,
which includes oil drilling, lost 5,000 jobs.
   Service industries added 317,000 jobs, bolstered by the
returning telephone workers and by a gain of 95,000 government
jobs, most of those in local government, the likely result of the
start of a new school year.
   Economists said the distribution of gains and losses follow the
pattern set this year, in which workers in housing and at factories
producing big-ticket items such as automobiles have suffered most
from an earlier campaign by the Fed to fight inflation with higher
interest rates.
   The central bank began easing rates in June and since then
statistics have shown a slower, but still growing, economy in no
danger of toppling into a recession.
   The unemployment rate hit a 15-year low of 5.0 percent in March
and since then has fluctuated narrowly between 5.1 percent and 5.3
percent.
   ``The most disturbing feature of September's business survey
data was the large decline in manufacturing employment,''
Commissioner of Labor Statistics Janet L. Norwood said in testimony
prepared for Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ``Real growth in
overall factory employment ended last March; since then, we have
lost 135,000 factory jobs.''
   Nevertheless, 117.5 million Americans held jobs and 6.6 million
were looking for work in September, essentially unchanged from
August.
   The government said average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent to
$9.73 last month after holding steady in August. For the year
ending in September, average hourly earnings increased 3.8 percent,
well behind the rate of consumer price inflation.
   The average manufacturing work week and factory overtime edged
up 0.1 hour to 41.0 and 3.8 hours, respectively, offsetting small
declines in August.
   Other than the swings in the unemployment rates for adult men
and women, there were no dramatic shift in rates among other
demographic groups last month, although the rate for black

<HEAD>Small Business and Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ask the operator of a small business what he or
she thinks about a local banker, and you're likely to get a very
direct and intense response.
   But it isn't true the response will always be negative.
   No mystery there; millions of small companies wouldn't exist
without banks, which usually control the wherewithal for starting a
business. One study found 45 percent of all small-business founders
used money from commercial lenders.
   That said, those intense feelings often are critical, among
other reasons because of what are perceived to be high rates, fees,
collateral requirements that involve personal guarantees, and
cookie-cutter bank products.
   Sampling small business is a frustrating task, partly because it
as a whole is so large and diverse. More than 17 million federal
tax returns in 1985 contained business income and about 99 percent
of all businesses are considered small.
   Even that doesn't tell the whole story. Most small businesses
are very small, with nearly 60 percent of them employing only one
to four people. No less than 90 percent of small businesses have
fewer than 20 employees.
   Economists working for the National Federation of Independent
Business foundation did manage to get a fair sampling of opinion,
however, but only after soliciting and examining responses from
7,970 small-business owners.
   Summarizing them, the economists concluded that ``no business
relationship seems to draw more strong and divergent opinion from
small-business men and women than the relationship with bankers.''
   Respondents were very concerned about those interest rates.
``They feel the rates charged them are excessive, particularly
compared to the rates charged the `best corporate customers.'''
   The NFIB economists say the small guys have a point. ``Many
small-business customers after all are the best corporate customers
in everything but size.'' But when banks think of ``best,'' the
economists say, they often mean big.
   Those high rates might also be even higher through the use of
fees and service charges, which appear to be on the increase.
Sometimes, say the small-business customers, they don't even know
what the fees are for.
   Thus, the authors conclude, ``the capacity of banks to readily
obfuscate basic fee questions _ purposefully or not _ leaves uneasy
feelings,'' and greatly limit the customer's ability to make
banking comparisons.
   Healthy earnings, the authors say, have muted this problem
temporarily. ``But should inflation return or earnings dissipate,
small-business demands for lower interest rates and schemes to
obtain them will be enormous.''
   Concern over collateral requirements, most of which involved
assignment of the borrower's home, was second only to interest
rates. The high level of concern perplexed the economists, because
personal-resource assignment isn't new.
   Seeking an answer, the economists found the greatest concern
seemed to be in urban areas, leading them to surmise that rural
lenders based decisions on direct, local, personal knowledge not as
easily available to city lenders.
   The irritation over cookie-cutter banking is more understandable.
   Great diversity within the small-business population implies
that they also need a diversity of borrowing conditions _ infinite
combinations of interest charges, fees, collateral requirements and
maturity dates, for example.
   Alas, it isn't so. The study found that with authority often
removed from the local branch office, the only thing available to
the local borrower is a sort of a care package from the main
office, with no exceptions tolerated.
   The result, it concludes, is an added area of tension, this one
between the small-business need for individualized borrowing and
the banks' insistence on greater uniformity.

<HEAD>Ford Gets U.S. Approval to Buy up to 15 Percent of Jaguar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has received U.S. regulatory
clearance to buy up to 15 percent of Jaguar PLC, a spokesman for
Ford's British unit said Friday.
   Ford received early clearance by the Federal Trade Commission,
which must approve major share acquisitions under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, said the Ford U.K. spokesman, who was not
identified, in accordance with British practice.
   ``We're pleased because we believe an association between Ford
and Jaguar would be beneficial to both companies, and we further
believe that Ford because of its commitment to Great Britain would
be the most natural partner for Jaguar,'' Ford spokesman Rex
Greenslade in Detroit said.
   Jaguar shares closed $1 higher at $11.77 on London's Stock
Exchange. Volume was a heavy 13 million shares.
   It was not immediately clear whether Ford had purchased any
Jaguar shares Friday. It previously owned about 1 percent of the
British luxury auto maker.
   Ford announced Sept. 19 that it wanted to buy up to 15 percent
of Jaguar, and left open the option of making a full bid for the
British company.
   Jaguar's rules of association prohibit any shareholder from
taking more than a 15 percent stake before the end of 1990 and give
the British government a ``golden'' share with which it may block
any bid for the formerly state-owned company.
   Jaguar has characterized Ford's stake-buying as unwelcome and
says it wants to remain independent.
   The company, however, has indicated it might be interested in
building ties with a major auto company as a means of acquiring
greater financial resources. Jaguar has been losing money.

<TEXT>
   London shares ended slightly lower on London's
Stock Exchange Friday, but well above their session lows, as the
market rallied on the back of renewed takeover speculation
surrounding Jaguar and Saatchi and Saatchi.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 4.1
points, or 0.2 percent, lower at 2,277.5. At one point it had been
down 31.7 points.
   The market opened sharply weaker in reaction to the British
government action to raise interest rates a full percentage point
to 15 percent on Thursday.
   But buying interest in Jaguar PLC and Saatchi and Saatchi PLC
pushed the market forward. Ford Motor Co. announced it had received
U.S. regulatory clearance to begin buying up to 15 percent of
Jaguar, and advertising giant Saatchi and Saatchi was the subject
of takeover rumors.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 8.4 points to close at
1,857.8. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 3.79 points to
close at 1,269.37.
   Volume amounted to a fairly heavy 505.5 million shares Friday,
compared with 491.4 million shares Thursday.

<HEAD>Bush Meets With GOP Senators; Appeals Anew for Capital Gains Cut</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: To UPDATE, SUBS grafs 3-5, The White, with new grafs 3-8 with
Fitzwater quotes on capital gains. Also moved on general news wires.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush pushed anew today for Senate
approval of his capital gains tax cut, saying the tax relief was
``not an extraneous matter with me.''
   Leaving a Capitol Hill meeting with Republican senators, Bush
said he told the lawmakers the House had ``acted decisively'' in
approving a capital gains tax cut last week and he wanted them to
follow suit.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
opposes a proposal to remove the capital gains tax cut from a major
deficit-reduction bill to consider it separately.
   ``We believe capital gains (reduction) is important. It's been
part of the process from the very beginning. It's already passed
the House, and we believe now is the time to include it in the
bill,'' he said.
   Asked if Bush would veto the overall measure, needed to reduce
the budget deficit for this year to below $110 billion and thus
avoid across-the-board spending cuts, Fitzwater said: ``We want the
capital gains tax cut in there.''
   Fitzwater said Bush stands ready to veto the overall measure if
it contains items ``that he finds onerous or inappropriate.'' The
adminstration ``can live with'' the automatic spending cuts that
likely would be triggered later this month by such a veto ``if we
have to,'' the spokesman said.
   Earlier, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., told a reporter he sensed
the White House wanted a promise from Democrats for clear shot at a
vote on capital gains. ``If they get that promise, I think they
will be happy to strip this bill,'' he said.
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., said Republicans won't drop the
capital gains tax cut from the bill if the only thing Democrats are
willing to do in return is to drop their proposal for a restoration
of IRA deductions.
   ``We're not going to do that kind of business,'' Domenici said
upon emerging from the meeting with Darman and Brady.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said he personally was willing to
settle for a promise by Democrats that the capital gains issue
would be considered as an amendment to another bill, possibly must
legislation to raise the ceiling on the federal debt.
   However, Packwood, who attended the meeting with Darman and
Brady, added, ``That doesn't reflect the views of the
administration.''
   As an amendment on the debt ceiling bill, Republicans would only
have to muster 50 votes instead of the 60 that might be needed to
shut off a possible filibuster delaying its consideration on the
budget reduction bill..
   Asked about criticism from some Democrats that the
budget-reconciliation bill is weighted down with the issues not
related to cutting the deficit, Bush told reporters that the
capital gains cut was ``not an extraneous matter with me.''
   The president thanked the lawmakers for ``extraordinary
cooperation and leadership'' but added that ``there are bound to be
differences between the White House and Senate'' on how to approach
the tax-and-spend issues.
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of investments,
now are fully taxed at the same rates as other income. Under the
House-passed bill, the top rate of 33 percent would be cut to 19.6
percent until 1992, when it would be raised to 28 percent and
``indexed'' to avoid taxing gains arising solely from inflation.
   Republicans have supported Bush on the tax cut, while most
Democrats have opposed the idea.
   Bush said that capital gains was ``not an extraneous matter with
me'' and that he wants quick Senate action on the proposal.
   The president also met with Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   After the meeting with Mitchell, Bush walked onto the Senate
floor briefly, shaking hands with a few of the lawmakers there. He
left just a few seconds later. Presidents normally appear only in
the House chamber for State of the Union speeches or other formal
addesses to joint sessions of Congress.
   Associate Senate historian Don Ritchie said he had no record of
any previous chief executive casually strolling onto the floor.
   Bush's appearance on Capitol Hill came as Republican senators
worked with the administration to devise a capital gains tax cut
that could win enough Democratic support to pass the Senate this
weekend.
   Packwood already had begun soliciting support for his own
capital gains plan. That proposal, which failed in the Senate
Finance Committee on a 10-10 vote earlier this week, is expected to
be the starting point for whatever plan the Senate considers.
   Under Packwood's proposal, the longer an investment was held,
the less of its profits would be taxed when sold. Packwood seeks to
add the plan to a giant deficit-reduction bill as a substitute for
a Democratic saving incentive that would expand tax-deductible
Individual Retirement Accounts.
   The House on Thursday passed its version of the deficit bill
that included the capital gains reduction.
   A surprise new element into the capital gains issue was
introduced in the Senate on Thursday night.
   Senate leaders expressed hope that the budget bill could be
stripped of the hundreds of provisions attached to it that have
nothing to do with reducing the deficit. Should that come about and
if the House went along, it could prevent approval this year of
either a capital gains cut or an IRA expansion.
   Mitchell said so much has been tacked onto the budget bill that
it will be impossible to complete congressional action on it in
time to prevent automatic across-the-board spending cuts from being
triggered on Oct. 16.
   Those cuts are required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law
when Congress cannot agree on revenue increases and spending
reductions.

   A small Swedish firm has signed a
jackpot deal to sell 25,000 one-armed bandits to the Soviet Union,
the national news agency TT reported Friday.
   The company, Bonik AB, almost went bankrupt after the Swedish
authorities banned the gambling slot machine 10 years ago.
   TT said Bonik was buying existing machines from all over Sweden

truck to various towns in the Soviet Union.
   Bonik was to supply the machines over a 10-year period. The
first 250 have already been delivered.

   The stock market climbed toward new highs today,
responding to the latest evidence of sluggish economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.96 points to
2,785.52 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 775 up, 651 down and
476 unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point in
September to 5.3 percent.
   The data also showed an increase of 209,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, well short of advance estimates on Wall Street in the
range of 275,000 to 300,000.
   Analysts said traders interpreted the report as a fresh signal
that the economy was making only sluggish progress. The widespread
inference from that, brokers said, was that chances were improving
for a further easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy sooner
or later.
   The report sent interest rates lower in the credit markets.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell about 20 basis points, or
hundredths of a percentage point.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, fell about $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   USX led the active list, up { at 38~. Late Thursday Carl Icahn
disclosed that he had raised his stake in USX, confirming recent
rumors that he was intensifying pressure on the company.
   AMR, subject of a $120-a-share takeover offer from investor
Donald Trump, climbed 3{ to 103].
   National Education tumbled 3{ to 8{. On Thursday the company
said it expected to post a loss for the third quarter, and looks
for fourth-quarter revenues to be down significantly from the like
period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .86 to 198.91. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.44 at 395.87.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 128.05 million shares with two

<HEAD>Evergreen Airways Buys Planes From Boeing, McDonnell Douglas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: rewrites throughout with details.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evergreen Airways Corp. of Taiwan said it signed
contracts with Boeing Commercial Airplanes and McDonnell Douglas
Corp. today for the purchase of 26 aircraft valued at a total of
$3.6 billion.
   According to the agreements, Boeing will deliver eight 747-400
and four 767-300ER passenger jets to Evergreen between 1992 and
1997 while McDonnell Douglas will deliver 14 MD-11 craft.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin
said Boeing's share included firm orders for four of the long-range
747 jumbo jets and two of the extended-range 767s. Evergreen took
options on an equal number of aircraft, he said.
   The total Boeing order, including options, is worth $1.93
billion in delivery-year dollars, the price Evergreen will pay when
it actually receives the planes, Martin said.
   The 747-400, which entered service in the past year, can carry
412 passengers 8,400 miles. The 767-300ER is a twin-engine widebody
jet that can carry 210 passengers 6,900 miles.
   It was not known if the current strike against Boeing by its
machinists, in its third day Friday, would affect the aircraft
maker's delivery schedule.
   McDonnell Douglas' MD-11, which is due to enter service next
year, is a long-range, three-engine jumbo jet that will carry about
320 passengers in two classes.
   Evergreen, which was founded in March, plans its first flight
for 1992. The airline's initial destinations are expected to be in
Asia while flights to the United States and Europe will be added
later.
   When it begins flights, Evergreen will be Taiwan's second
international airline operator. China Air Lines is the other.
   Evergreen is owned by Evergreen Group, said to be the world's
largest container-ship operator, possessing 66 modernized container
vessels that travel to over 30 ports worldwide.

<HEAD>Computer Virus Threatens Dutch PCs, Expert Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dutch police are doing brisk
business with an antidote against a computer virus that is set to
attack on or after Oct. 13 on both sides of the Atlantic, police
said Friday.
   The harmful but relatively rare Datacrime virus is also called
the Columbus Day virus because it attacks the day after the
traditional date for Columbus Day.
   The virus is apparently more common in the Netherlands than in
the United States, American computer security experts have said.
   Dutch newspapers said earlier this week that the Datacrime virus
has reportedly spread to 10 percent of the Netherlands' personal
computers, but Hague police spokesman Rob Brons said Friday that
``those figures are possibly inflated.''
   In the United States, there have been fewer than a dozen
confirmed sightings of the dormant virus by experts who dismantled
it to figure out how it works. However, other computer owners could
have it without knowing.
   U.S. government officials have no solid idea of how prevalent
the virus is, but believe it is fairly uncommon, spokesman Stewart
Katzke of the National Institute of Standards and Technology said
Friday.
   Brons said his force had sold ``hundreds'' of $2.35 floppy disks
with a program that purportedly detects and destroys the virus.
   The virus, which some say was created by an unidentified
Austrian computer expert, is expected to be activated when an
infected program is run anytime after Oct. 12 through Dec. 31,
according to Joe Hirst, a British expert on viruses.
   The virus wipes out the tables on the computer's hard disk so
the data and programs become inaccessible.
   ``There's not much you can do about it. The only remedy is to
find it and get rid of it,'' said Hirst in a telephone interview
from Brighton, England.
   The virus spreads through contaminated floppy disks or through
contact with other computers in networks or over phone lines. A
virus is a computer program that attaches to other programs and
makes copies of itself.
   Hirst said that as far as he knew the Netherlands was the only
European country in which the virus had been spotted.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Despite Intervention, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in busy European trading Friday,
as new investor demand and short covering helped overcome a round
of concerted central bank intervention.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar was quoted at 1.8880 Deutsche marks, up from 1.8845
marks late Thursday in London.
   The dollar was also changing hands at 142.50 yen. Earlier in
Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.40 yen to 142.45 yen.
   Overnight intervention by central banks from the United States,
West German and Japan was ignored as the dollar hit the day's high
of 1.9030 marks early in the European afternoon.
   One senior dealer said the U.S. currency was boosted by short
covering. Many market players had taken short positions in the
morning, and were forced to unload them when stop loss orders were
triggered around 1.8800 marks.
   Dealers appeared nonchalant about news that the U.S.
unemployment rate rose 0.1 point to 5.3 percent in September, while
non-farm payrolls rose a smaller-than-expected 209,000.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6365; 6.4035 French
francs, up from 6.3900; 2.1350 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1200;
1380.25 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1760 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1746.
   The British pound sterling traded at $1.6030, compared with

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in anticipation of heavy
harvesting activity this weekend in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures firmed slightly amid rumors that the Soviet Union
is seeking to buy an unknown quantity of U.S. wheat.
   Forecasts for clear, cool weather in most growing areas favor
farmers, who are busy bringing in the new crops.
   ``The market acted about the way you would think with a big
harvest weekend coming up,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   The rumors in the wheat market reflected a general increase in
export activity. Similar rumors supported the corn market all week,
and the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 2.5 million
metric tons of corn sold to the Soviets since last weekend.
   ``The estimates now range from 3 million all the way up to 7
million,'' said grain specialist Ted Mao of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 4 cents higher with
the contract for December delivery at $4.11 a bushel; corn was 4
cents to 5} cents lower with December at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were
2 cents to 3} cents lower with December at $1.43{ a bushel;
soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents lower with November at $5.67 a
bushel.

<HEAD>Say Boeing Walkout Reaffirms Strike as Labor Tactic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The walkout by Boeing Co. production workers
shows that unions believe strikes remain a potent bargaining tool,
despite a general decline in confrontational labor tactics over the
past several years.
   ``There's a bit of a popular notion that labor unions are waning
and that strikes are no longer useful. Nothing could be farther
from the truth,'' said Gary Hubbard, communications director for
the United Steelworkers of America.
   ``In a company where you haven't had a strike for awhile,
there's nothing to strengthen the union like a good, old-fashioned
donneybrook,'' Hubbard said in a telephone interview from
Washington.
   An estimated 57,800 members of the International Association of
Machinists struck Boeing despite a contract offer that exceeds or
equals many recent settlements nationwide.
   Boeing, which has seen five years of record jetliner orders,
offered what it called a reasonable package of raises, bonuses and
cost-of-living adjustments that was rejected by a 70 percent vote.
   William Whitlow, an aerospace industry analyst with the Dain
Bosworth investment firm in Seattle, said the Boeing strike could
mark a labor turnaround in the industry, where unionism has been
struggling since President Reagan crushed an air traffic
controllers strike eight years ago.
   ``You might even make the argument it could go beyond the
aerospace industry,'' Whitlow said.
   ``I think there is a greater militance within the labor movement
generally,'' said Arnie Winemeister, president of the Western
Council of Teamsters.
   Dan Bickford, president of the Seattle area's King County Labor
Council, said his AFL-CIO-affiliated organization had gained 23
unions with 12,000 members in the last three years.
   ``I think labor is on the upsurge,'' Bickford said. ``I'd also
say we have more union activism now than we did three or four years
ago.''
   He and others said the strike, the first in 12 years against the
world's largest commercial airplane builder, reflects growing union
militance that cuts across georgraphic areas and age groups.
   ``I think what we are seeing is a period in which unions are
emerging from a period of freezes, givebacks and concessions,''
said Robert Bonitati, an Air Line Pilots Association veteran who
once advised Reagan on labor questions.
   With an economy that remains resilient after years of
uninterrupted growth, ``people are coming back and saying, `Hey, we
want our piece of the pie.' '' Bonitati said. ``I hate to say it,
but (this is somewhat) a return to normalcy, although I don't think
you will ever see the level of strikes you once saw.''
   It was the second major walkout by machinists this year,
following a strike that resulted in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing
by Eastern Airlines.
   Boeing has turned to supervisors to complete work on some jets
while the assembly lines make do without 43,300 union members in
the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore.,
and a few hundred at scattered sites in California, Hawaii,
Montana, Utah and other states.
   Larry Kenney, president of the Washington State Labor Council,
said he generally found ``more of a willingness (among union
members) to take a hard position'' but was still ``surprised at the
strength of the vote.''
   More than half of those voting had been hired since the last
walkout by Boeing machinists, a 45-day strike in 1977. In Wichita,
union officials estimated the figure ran to 95 percent.
   ``Of course, many of them (recent hires) come from good union
families,'' said Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge
751 in Seattle.
   Victor Kamber, head of the Kamber Group, a public affairs
consultant for 30 unions in Washington, attributed a resurgence in
strike sentiment to what he called ``a greater militancy among the
younger workers.''
   Kamber, whose clients do not include the Machinists, said that
although the number of strikes, affected workers and lost hours
continued to decline, ``we have had a more visible year'' with
major walkouts against Pittston Coal, Eastern Airlines and several
telephone companies.
   Striking is still a valid tactic, even if it is no longer
labor's primary weapon, he said.
   ``Strikes are only going to take place and be successful where
you can really shut down the company,'' Kamber said.
   ``It runs counter to the direction of the overall labor movement
these days, but I have tremendous respect for the ability of the
Machinists Union to choose the right time and place to use that
weapon,'' he said.
   Bonitati, a Kamber vice president, said he expected strikes to
continue to decline.
   ``I think you see labor leaders looking at it with a great deal
of caution,'' Bonitati said. ``I think they will pick more
carefully if they have control ... (and) attempt to use strikes in
a very symbolic way and for very strategic purposes.''
   Hubbard said the Steelworkers negotiated contracts for more than
125,000 workers this year without any major strikes as the metals
industry recovers from a severe slump earlier in the decade. At
steelmakers alone, the union's bargaining jurisdiction fell from
400,000 jobs in 1980 to 180,000 today.
   ``The healthier the industry, the easier it is to resolve
contract disputes,'' Hubbard said.
   Noting the record airplane sales, profits and backlog of orders
at Boeing, he said, ``It's tragic that a strike would have to occur
in such a well-off industry.''
   Bonitati said most recent major strikes had been unsuccessful.
   The coal strike ``is inflicting serious, serious damage on that
union,'' the United Mine Workers, Bonitati said. ``From all
indications, it's going to last for a long, long time. It's going
to be a constant drain upon that union's treasury.''

   The stock market pushed ahead today, responding
to the latest evidence of sluggish economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.30 points to
2,782.86 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 752 up, 695 down and 486
unchanged.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point in
September to 5.3 percent.
   The data also showed an increase of 209,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, well short of advance estimates on Wall Street in the
range of 275,000 to 300,000.
   Analysts said traders interpreted the report as a fresh signal
that the economy was making only sluggish progress. The widespread
inference from that, brokers said, was that chances were improving
for a further easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy sooner
or later.
   The report sent interest rates lower in the credit markets.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell about 20 basis points, or
hundredths of a percentage point.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, rose about $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   USX led the active list, up \ at 38|. Late Thursday Carl Icahn
disclosed that he had raised his stake in USX, confirming recent
rumors that he was intensifying pressure on the company.
   AMR, subject of a $120-a-share takeover offer from investor
Donald Trump, climbed 3~ to 103}.
   National Education tumbled 3] to 8|. On Thursday the company
said it expected to post a loss for the third quarter, and looks
for fourth-quarter revenues to be down significantly from the like
period last year.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .77 to 198.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 1.29 at 395.72.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 146.85 million shares with an

<HEAD>Hospital Management Firm Pondered Offer Lowered by $230 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group that bid $1.9
billion for American Medical International Inc. in July said it has
lowered its offer for the hospital management company by $230
million.
   The new $1.67 billion cash offer by IMA Acquisition Corp.,
announced Thursday, represents the investment group's concern over
a tax bill that would make the acquisition more costly, according
to an analyst.
   AMI, based in Beverly Hills, was reviewing the offer early
Friday, and could not say when it would comment on the lower bid.
   ``The offer was given to a special committee of the board of
directors, and they have not responded,'' said Suzanne Hovdey,
spokeswoman for AMI.
   The investment group, financed by Chicago's Pritzker family and
First Boston Corp., said it would not be able to arrange financing
for the offer before it expired Oct. 11, and therefore could not
pay the original $28 per share. The new IMA offer would pay
shareholders $26.50 per share.
   The group initially planned to finance about $250 million of the
offer with payment-in-kind bonds, but the proposed tax change would
take away the tax deduction for the interest payments on those
bonds. The group has applied for an exemption to the new tax bill
submitted after IMA's July 7 offer.
   The bill has passed the House and has not been acted on by the
Senate.
   By submitting the lower bid, the group has given AMI executives
a new opportunity to put the hospital chain on the auction block,
according to Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein
&amp; Co. in New York.
   ``If no one offers more money, it (the amended bid) is a fair
offer,'' he said.
   Abramowitz said the partnership is citing uncertainty about the
new tax law to gain leverage with AMI. ``They used the IRS issue as
an excuse,'' he said. ``They reduced the price because they thought
they could get away with it.''
   Another analyst, Seth Shaw of Prudential Bache Securities in New
York, predicted AMI would accept the new bid.
   ``I still think it's a good offer for shareholders,'' he said.
``Anything over $18 is good.''
   First Boston was to have financed part of the deal with about
$700 million in junk bond sales, and several analysts pointed out
that IMA would have to pay millions of dollars more in interest to
attract bond buyers now that the junk bond market has softened.
   ``The conditions in the junk bond market have changed
dramatically since the original agreement,'' said John Hindelong,
an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New
York.
   ``The change is reflected in this offer. I think (AMI)
shareholders, given the changes in the junk bond market, will be
pleased with the offer.''

   Oil futures prices finished mixed Friday in
light, uneventful dealings.
   Crude oil futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange
moved lower. The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude which slipped 19 cents on Thursday,
lost another 9 cents to finish at $19.87 per 42-gallon barrel.
Subsequent months also retreated.
   Among petroleum products, gasoline futures contracts traded on
the exchange also fell while home heating oil rose.
   The November contract for unleaded gasoline was down 0.17 cent
to 54.80 cents a gallon. The near-term contract for home heating
oil, which tumbled 1.08 cents a gallon on Thursday, finished up
0.27 cent at 58.18 cents a gallon.
   Trading was very light. ``There's very little happening,'' said
Peter Beutel, an assistant director at Elders Futures Inc.
``Basically people are balancing their books before the weekend.''
   Beutel predicted trading would continue at a slow pace on Monday
since many traders will be out in observance of Yom Kippur.
   Reports that representatives of 12 independent oil-producing
nations would issue a communique on talks held for the past two
days in Kuala Lumpur had little effect on the day's activity in the
pits.
   The communique is scheduled to be issued at 5 a.m. EDT Saturday.

   The dollar finished mixed in U.S. trading after
marching higher overseas as investors remained bullish about the
U.S. currency despite ongoing efforts by central banks to squelch
demand.
   Gold finished higher in New York after falling in Europe and
Asia. Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid late in
the day at $363.25 an ounce, up from $363.10 late Thursday.
   Dollar traders mostly ignored efforts by central banks from the
United States, West Germany and Japan to push the currency lower,
raising more questions about the Group of Seven industrial nations'
attempts to stabilize world currency markets.
   ``Central banks don't seem to know what they want,'' said
Lawrence A. Veit, international economist with Brown Brothers
Harriman &amp; Co. ``Unless the central banks show a sign of getting
their act together we will see a stronger dollar.''
   The dollar firmed in early trading after showing surprising
resilience on Thursday despite coordinated interest-rate increases
by central banks in Europe. Normally, such a move would blunt the
dollar's attraction in global markets in favor of foreign
currencies.
   The dollar dipped briefly in U.S. trading after a Labor
Department report suggested the economy is softer than expected,
but quickly resumed its climb.
   The government reported that the nation's civilian unemployment
rate rose to 5.3 percent in September from 5.2 percent in July and
August and that the economy added 209,000 non-farm payroll jobs in
September, fewer than expected. Analysts said the markets had
expected a sharper gain of up to 300,000 non-farm payroll jobs.
   A softer economy could prompt the Fed to lower interest rates to
avoid a serious slowdown, making the dollar less appealing to
foreign investors. However, without evidence that the Fed was
moving to ease monetary policy the dollar resumed its upward climb.
   ``The short-term employment numbers were overridden by
longer-term bullishness on the dollar,'' said David Johnson,
currency broker at First National Bank of Chicago.
   Analysts said the Fed probably would wait for more confirmation
to see if indeed the economy is slowing down before altering its
credit policy.
   ``They're not going to ease rates because of a single set of
employment numbers,'' Johnson said.
   In Europe, the dollar was quoted at 1.8880 West German marks, up
from 1.8845 marks Thursday. In late New York trading, the dollar
climbed to 1.8885 marks, from 1.8848 on Thursday.
   The dollar rose 1.40 yen to 142.45 yen in Tokyo and changed
hands at 142.50 yen in London, up from 142.30. In New York,
meanwhile, the U.S. currency dipped to 142.35 yen from 142.55 yen a
day earlier.
   In London trading, the British pound rose to $1.6030, from
$1.6100 late Thursday. But in New York, the pound fell to $1.6055
from $1.6115 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6420 Swiss francs, up from 1.6360;
1.17525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17625; 6.4050 French francs,
up from 6.3865; and 1,383.25 Italian lire, up from 1,380.00.
   Other dollar rates in Europe late Friday compared with
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6435 Swiss francs, up from 1.6365;
6.4035 French francs, up from 6.3900; 2.1350 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.1200; 1380.25 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1760 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1746.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $363.70 an ounce, up from $363.40 on Thursday.
   Gold dropped $1.75 in London to a late bid of $363.25 a troy
ounce. In Zurich, gold fell to $362.80 compared with $364.75 late
Thursday. Gold fell in Hong Kong by $2.91 to close at $364.20 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion prices skidded on the London market to a late bid
price of $5.14 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $5.27.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.117 an ounce, down from from $5.166.

<HEAD>Prices Tumble As Coffee Meeting Ends Without Accord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices sank for the fourth straight day Friday,
hitting 14-year lows after a meeting of the world's biggest coffee
producers and consumers ended with no price-support agreement.
   ``They're going to keep the door open for negotiations and
that's it,'' said Kim Badenhop, a market analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets Inc.
   On other commodity markets, corn and soybeans slumped while
livestock, precious metals and energy futures were mixed.
   Coffee futures finished 2.5 cents to 2.79 cents lower with
December at 70.39 cents a pound, the market's lowest settlement
since the summer of 1975.
   The sell-off coincided with the close of the International
Coffee Organization's two-week semiannual meeting in London, a
session that produced only a vague resolution interpreted by
analysts as an attempt to keep the bottom from falling out of the
world coffee market.
   ``They put their signatures on a goodwill declaration to meet in
the future when conditions are right,'' said Bert Ruiz, a vice
president with Balfour Maclaine Corp. ``The big news from the
meeting was no news.''
   The 74-nation group is not scheduled to meet again for six
months.
   Prices for near-month delivery of coffee in New York have fallen
by 38 percent since early July, when ICO producers, led by Brazil,
balked at demands by the consumers, led by the United States, for
increased availability of top-quality coffees and a halt to sales
of coffee at discount prices to nonmembers. The disagreement led to
a suspension of the export quotas that had supported coffee prices.
   Few observers expected the differences to be ironed out at the
London meeting. But pessimism about the organization's future
multiplied following statements made Tuesday by Jorio Dauster,
president of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, that he saw no chance
for a return to international price supports for at least six
months.
   Corn and soybean futures drooped on the Chicago Board of Trade
in anticipation of heavy harvesting activity this weekend in the
Midwest.
   Wheat futures firmed slightly amid rumors that the Soviet Union
is seeking to buy an unknown quantity of U.S. wheat.
   The rumors in the wheat market reflected a general increase in
export activity. Similar rumors supported the corn market all week.
   The Agriculture Department confirmed a sale of 1.1 million
metric tons of corn to the Soviets late Friday, bringing to more
than 3.6 million metric tons the amount confirmed since the weekend.
   Wheat futures settled } cent to 4 cents higher with December at
$4.11{ a bushel; corn was 4 cents to 5\ cents lower with December
at $2.38} a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 3} cents lower with
December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were 3\ cents to 6{ cents
lower with November at $5.67{ a bushel.
   Frozen pork-belly futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid lower fresh belly prices on cash markets and
speculation that cash prices would drop even further next week due
to a rise in hog slaughters.
   Hog and cattle futures finished mostly lower although near-month
live cattle futures gained on expectations for stronger cash
markets next week.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent lower to .37 cent higher with
October at 71.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25
cent lower with October at 82.97 cents a pound; live hogs were .28
cent lower to .58 cent higher with October at 46.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .68 cent to 1.30 cents lower with February
at 47.12 cents a pound.
   Gold futures settled 40 cents lower to 30 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange with October at $363.70 a troy ounce;
silver was 4.9 cents to 6.7 cents lower with December at $5.19 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures finished mixed in uneventful trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.

   Having written the book on the art of the deal
in real estate, casinos and the airline business, Donald Trump is a
good bet to secure the financing he needs to pull off his $7
billion offer for American Airlines parent AMR Corp., experts
believe.
   His chances for success were viewed positively Friday, despite
recent turmoil in the credit markets.
   ``He's borrowed in the past and paid back and he's viewed as a
good customer,'' said Lawrence Cohn, a banking analyst at
investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Trump, who promised to put up a staggering $1 billion of his own
money for the deal, seems to have a winning combination: a string
of blue-chip real estate and casino properties he could borrow
against, and the highly regarded AMR itself _ whose assets could be
considered as collateral.
   Dallas-based AMR includes American, the nation's largest
airline; SABRE, the leading computer reservations system valued at
around $1.5 billion; and a modernized jet fleet more than half of
which is owned by the carrier, rather than leased.
   Trump's relations with bankers have been warm, and he appears
capable of surmounting a less than hospitable investment climate,
anxiety in Washington and some skepticism about his intentions.
   ``I think it will be difficult. Seven billion dollars is a lot,
even for Donald Trump,'' said Marilyn Cohen, president of Capital
Insight Inc., an investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif. ``That's
not to say the man can't pull it off.''
   Big corporate borrowing is a lot more difficult these days, in
the wake of recent trouble in the ``junk-bond'' market, Ms. Cohen
noted.
   Prices of the high-risk, high-yield bonds plunged in
mid-September after Campeau Corp., a major retailer and junk-bond
issuer, said it would have trouble paying its bills. The Campeau
crisis mushroomed throughout the junk-bond market and spilled over
into bank lending _ since many of the big banks also finance
mergers and acquisitions, including some junk-bond deals.
   Nevertheless, ``really good deals do continue to get done,''
said Drexel's Cohn. ``If it's a solid deal, then the banks are
going to lend on it.''
   Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said it would take at least $3 billion of equity for Trump's offer
to be a healthy one. That's assuming Trump would assume AMR's $1.5
billion in debt, putting the real value of the deal at around $8.5
billion, and figuring a desirable ratio of two-thirds debt to
one-third equity.
   But Louis Marckesano, who follows the industry for the
Philadelphia brokerage of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said $1
billion in equity was sufficient for the deal to fly.
   In addition to the dampened borrowing climate Trump faces,
observers also note the rumbling drumbeat of anxiety coming from
the Bush administration and Congress about high levels of debt
being created by the wave of takeovers and proposed buyouts in the
airline industry.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner has recently expressed
concern about the debt piled up by big airline buyouts and the
participation of foreign carriers in the deals. His department has
intervened in two airline deals _ the $3.65 billion takeover of NWA
Inc., Northwest Airline's parent, and the proposed $6.75 billion
buyout of United Airline's owner, UAL Corp.
   Congress also has grabbed on to the issue, scheduling committee
hearings and studying legislation on airline takeovers.
   Trump's offer for AMR ``is another instance of quick-profit
speculation in the airline industry that is endangering the
nation's air transportation system,'' said Rep. Byron L. Dorgan,
D-N.D. ``None of this makes any economic sense,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Washington.
   Some analysts question Trump's sincerity in the bid, in light of
his track record of making takeover runs at companies and then
turning a quick profit by selling his stock.
   But others jump to his defense. ``I think he is extremely
serious about this and it's a mistake to think otherwise,'' said
Helane Becker, an airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.

   The stock market gained more ground Friday,
continuing its week-long drive to record highs in buying attributed
to hopes for an easier Federal Reserve credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.96 points to
2,785.52, extending its gain for the week to 92.70 points.
   That marked the best weekly showing for the average since it
climbed 114.86 points May 31-June 3, 1988.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
780 up, 667 down and 520 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 172.52 million
shares, against 177.89 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 209 million shares.
   Before the opening the Labor Department reported that the
civilian unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point in
September to 5.3 percent.
   The data also showed an increase of 209,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, well short of advance estimates on Wall Street in the
range of 275,000 to 300,000.
   Analysts said traders interpreted the report as a fresh signal
that the economy was making only sluggish progress. The inference
from that, brokers said, was that chances were improving for a
further easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy sooner or
later.
   The report sent interest rates lower in the credit markets.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell about 20 basis points, or
hundredths of a percentage point.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in
face value.
   USX led the active list, up [ at 38{. Late Thursday Carl Icahn
disclosed that he had raised his stake in USX, confirming recent
rumors that he was intensifying pressure on the company.
   Other gainers among the blue-chip industrials included Philip
Morris, up 3| at 178|; General Electric, up { at 58~; Exxon, up |
at 45], and General Motors, up ] at 48|.
   AMR, subject of a $120-a-share takeover offer from investor
Donald Trump, climbed 3{ to 103].
   National Education tumbled 3} to 8\. On Thursday the company
said it expected to post a loss for the third quarter, and looks
for fourth-quarter revenues to be down significantly from the like
period last year.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $16.95 billion, or
0.48 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .89 to 198.94.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.24 to 409.22, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.81 at 358.78.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 2.98 to 483.64. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 395.93, up 1.50.

   Bond prices soared Friday on expectations the
Federal Reserve might soon lower interest rates following a
government report showing a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in
September.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up 21-32 point, or
about $6.56 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls
when prices rise, dropped to 8.01 percent from 8.07 percent late
Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported Friday that the nation's civilian
unemployment rate rose a notch to 5.3 percent in September from 5.2
percent in July and August.
   A separate survey of employers showed that the economy added
209,000 non-farm payroll jobs in September, despite an artificial
increase reflecting the return of some 75,000 striking telephone
workers. Analysts said the markets had expected a sharper gain of
up to 300,000 non-farm payroll jobs.
   More important, economists said, was a loss of 103,000
manufacturing jobs, including 33,000 at auto plants. Payrolls
either declined or were flat within all manufacturing industries
except food processing.
   ``That's going to get people's attention and raise some concerns
since it's not just a special factor,'' such as autos, said Jean
Buckley, money market economist at BankAmerica Capital Markets
Group in San Francisco.
   ``The concern will be that the manufacturing sector is much
weaker than people have been expecting,'' she said.
   Buckley said analysts are estimating that industrial production
will be 0.4 percent lower and capacity utilization 0.6 percent
lower following the employment report.
   A weakening economy is bullish for fixed-income instruments such
as bonds because long-term investments more attractive during an
economic slowdown.
   The jobs report could encourage the Federal Reserve to ease
interests rates in the near term to reinvigorate the economy. But
on Friday the central bank's action in draining some bank reserves
was perceived as a signal that Fed policy had not changed.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose by between 5-32 point and 9-16 point, intermediate
maturities climbed by as much as 19-32 point and long-term issues
rose as much as 29-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, jumped 5.75 to 1,185.21.
   In corporate trading, industrials rose. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, shot up
2.25 to 333.50.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was 9223-32, up ] point. The average yield
to maturity fell to 7.33 percent from 7.37 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on Treasury bills were down sharply. Three-month bills
fell to 7.82 percent as the discount plunged 17 basis points to
7.58 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.02 percent as the
discount fell 18 basis points to 7.62 percent. Yields on one-year
bills fell to 8.06 percent as the discount dropped 21 basis points
to 7.51 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 813-16 percent, down from 9 percent late
Thursday.

<HEAD>Borden to Sell 14 Dairy Plants in 10 States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. said Friday it plans to sell
14 dairy plants in 10 states as part of a restructuring to reduce
its work force and concentrate in markets where it has performed
well.
   It was the first indication which of the company's 265 plants
worldwide will be closed or sold.
   Company spokeswoman Chris Tilton said the company will sell
plants in Dayton, Youngstown and New Bremen, all in Ohio; Miami,
Pensacola and Tampa, all in Florida; Albany, N.Y.; Albuquerque,
N.M.; Detroit; High Point, N.C.; Indianapolis, Lexington, Ky.;
Macon, Ga., and Milwaukee.
   Ms. Tilton said the company intends to find buyers who will
retain the 2,400 employees affected by the sales.
   ``We've made the announcement to employees throughout the past
week,'' she said. ``These are the actions we're taking in 1989.
This completes our dairy announcements for this year.''
   The corporate restructuring, announced Sept. 28 at the company's
headquarters in New York, will result in cutting 7,000 jobs _ 15
percent of the company's work force. Romeo J. Ventres, chairman and
chief executive officer, said 65 plants will be closed or sold over
the next two to three years.
   Ms. Tilton said the company has potential buyers for some of the
14 plants. She would not identify buyers or the plants.
   ``We have had interest expressed by a number of buyers for many
of the locations. ... We would certainly expect to have offers
coming in for all of them,'' she said. ``Local management is
getting the right of first refusal.''
   All of the plants market and distribute fluid milk products.
   The company said the restructuring will reduce Borden's
worldwide employment from 46,000 to about 39,000.
   Borden said food and non-food operations also will be
restructured to eliminate some of the less efficient and older
plants the company has acquired in recent years.
   Borden will take a $571 million pre-tax charge against its
third-quarter income, resulting in a quarterly loss of $300 million
to $305 million and a loss of $47 million to $58 million for the
full year.
   The one-time charge, amounting to about $404 million after
taxes, will be used to consolidate Borden's six business lines. The
goal is to cut costs and boost pre-tax profit by aboubt $340
million through 1993.
   Although Borden is based in New York, its administrative offices
are in Columbus.

   If the Machinists union strike against Boeing Co.
drags out, one consequence could be a deeper U.S. trade deficit,
analysts say.
   Boeing, which has 65 percent of the free world's commercial
jetliner market, is the nation's third-largest exporter. If the
Machinists strike that began Wednesday morning slows aircraft
deliveries, the delayed sales would start showing up in trade
figures.
   ``They do something like a billion dollars a month in exports,''
said Gene Kingsbury, an aerospace analyst at the U.S. Department of
Commerce. ``A slowdown in shipments is going to affect it (trade)
directly.''
   Of the $12 billion worth of aircraft Boeing delivered in the
first nine months of this year, $8.4 billion in planes went
overseas, said Tom Cole, a Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman.
   If those planes had not been shipped, the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit for the same period would have been close to $92 billion
instead of the $80 billion economists are forecasting.
   Boeing has about 40 planes that are close to delivery. Among
them are 747-400 jumbo jets for Malaysia Airlines, Singapore
Airlines and British Airways.
   Analysts say Boeing should be able to make up a two- or
three-week gap in production. Even if the strike drags on for
several months, the effects of a slowdown in deliveries probably
would not be felt until early next year, because December normally
is a slow month, said analyst Wolfgang Demisch at UBS Securities in
New York.
   ``The damage of the strike will grow exponentially as it
continues,'' Demisch said. The longer workers are away, the longer
it will take for the production line to return to normal.
   About 53 percent of Boeing's orders come from overseas, but the
value of those orders is far higher because it includes a number of
long-range 747-400s, Boeing's largest aircraft, which sell for
about $125 million each.
   Future deliveries are expected to continue to be weighted in
favor of overseas sales since the size of the foreign jet fleet, at
about 8,600 planes, has overtaken the size of the U.S. fleet, which
has about 3,900.

   Production continued slowly at Boeing Co. plants
Friday as a strike by 57,800 machinists stretched into its third
day without the company or union scheduling new talks to end the
walkout.
   Separately, Boeing announced it had gained another
multibillion-dollar aircraft order, from Evergreen Airways Corp. of
Taiwan, further adding to the company's huge backlog of airliner
orders.
   Federal mediator Douglas Hammond said no new talks had been
scheduled.
   Union officials have said they would resume talks whenever
Boeing indicated it was ready, although Boeing spokesman Harold
Carr said the Machinists had made no specific offer and had not set
a date for when they would be willing to return to negotiations.
   The union went on strike Wednesday after its three-year contract
with Boeing expired and the parties were unable to reach agreement
on a new pact.
   Boeing is offering cost-of-living raises, bonuses a reduction in
mandatory overtime and other improvements.
   The Machinists _ who represent the bulk of Boeing production
workers _ want a larger than offered share of Boeing's financial
prosperity and a bigger reduction in hours of mandatory overtime at
the company, which is pressing hard to increase aircraft production
because of record aircraft orders.
   Work was still far from normal Friday at many Boeing plants, a
company spokesman said, and members of another Boeing union said
they were getting some harassment from striking machinists.
   Strikers include 43,300 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita,
Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and others at several locations
nationwide.
   All Boeing plants are open, though Boeing Commercial Airplanes
spokesman Jack Gamble said things were ``going very slowly'' at
aircraft production plants, where supervisors were manning
production lines.
   A Malaysian Airlines 747-400 should be delivered this week,
Gamble said, but he was not aware of any other planes that had been
scheduled for delivery in the past few days. The Malaysian plane
has been awaiting only final FAA certification for delivery, he
said.
   Boeing has 93 planes scheduled for delivery between now and the
end of the year and Gamble said about 40 of those were near
completion.
   Before the strike, Boeing was producing about 30 planes a month,
and was running near capacity.
   Boeing, the world's largest commercial jet builder with 65
percent of the free world's market, is in its fifth consecutive
year of record jetliner orders.
   Evergreen Airways ordered 26 jets from Boeing and McDonnell
Douglas Corp. Boeing's share includes firm orders for four 747-400s
and two extended-range 767-300ERs, plus options for four 747-400s
and two 767-300ERs. Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said the total
Boeing order, including options, eventually would be worth $1.93
billion.
   Charles Bofferding, president of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, the second-largest union at
Boeing after the Machinists, sent his 27,000 members letters saying
that some SPEEA members ``are meeting with resistance and mild
harassment'' when going to work.
   Bofferding urged his members to wear union identification and to
decline to do Machinists' work.
   On Thursday night, a picket outside Boeing's Everett plant that
builds widebody 747 and 767 jetliners received a broken arm when
struck by a pickup truck at the plant's west gate, according to
Everett police spokesman Ken Murray. A friend of the injured man
then struck the driver with his fist and was arrested for
investigation of assault, Murray said.
   The driver of the truck was not cited. Murray said witnesses
said he attempted to stop and couldn't swerve because of other
pickets in the street.

<HEAD>Politicians, Labor Lining Up Against Trump's AMR Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of American Airlines'
second-largest union met with advisers Friday to discuss possible
ways to help management fend off developer Donald Trump's $7
billion buyout proposal.
   Michael Kelleher, president of the 16,000-member Association of
Professional Flight Attendants, was notified of the offer by
management early Thursday. He traveled to New York Friday to meet
with ``legal and labor advisers to prepare contingency plans in
light of any events that may transpire,'' said Alan Fahringer, a
spokesman for the independent union.
   Also Friday, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, exchanged letters with
Trump, expressing concern over the wave of airline takeovers.
Bentsen is a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation which Thursday recommended legislation that
would require federal approval of takeovers.
   In a letter to Bentsen, Trump said he was ``sensitive'' to the
concerns, especially ``regarding excessive leverage, as evidenced
by my stated intention to commit at least $1 billion of equity to
an acquisition of the company.''
   ``Airlines must be financially fit enough to meet rigorous
safety standards, replace aging aircraft, contribute their fair
share to improve airport facilities, as well as maintain an
adequate and well-trained labor force,'' replied Bentsen, who is
working on having legislation retroactive to cover Trump's proposal.
   Other local and national politicians also began lining up
against Trump, criticizing the real estate tycoon's lack of
experience in running an airline, plus the amount of debt expected
to be included in the deal.
   Trump, who is based in New York, bought Eastern Airlines'
lucrative Northeast shuttle service for $365 million in early June.
   Trump's offer of $120 for each of the 58.9 million outstanding
shares of American's parent AMR Corp. was revealed Thursday by the
airline.
   AMR remained silent on Trump's offer Friday, declining all
comment. On Thursday, the company said the offer would be
considered ``in due course,'' but refused to say when the board of
directors would meet. Trump officials said no meeting between the
two sides had been scheduled.
   Trading in AMR stock slacked off Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, as 3.4 million shares changed hands. The stock closed at
$103.37{ a share, up $3.50. On Thursday, more than 8.3 million
shares were traded as the stock opened at $106.50 a share, but fell
back to close at $99.87{.
   Analysts have suggested one possible defense against Trump would
be a competing offer from a management-employee group, similar to
the $6.75 billion offer currently pending for United Airlines
parent UAL Corp. to block investor Marvin Davis.
   Fahringer said it is too early to say if the flight attendants
would participate in such a deal. ``Everybody's talking and
everybody's trying to keep their options open,'' he said.
   Officials of the other unions at American were unavailable to
discuss the matter. The airline is widely considered to have good
labor relations.
   Employees at American's biggest hub at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport were cheering for management to win the
battle.
   ``Bobby Crandall's got everybody in the company behind him,''
said Sollie Pearson, referring to AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall.
   ``There's a big difference between American and (Trump's) little
shuttle,'' said Bryan Atkins, a member of a ground support crew.
   In his letter, Trump told Crandall that through the Eastern
shuttle purchase he ``gained substantial insight'' into the
competitive airline business.
   ``I think that's a silly statement,'' said Tom Luce, a candidate
for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Texas and former
attorney for billionaire H. Ross Perot. ``I don't think they need
the advice of Donald Trump and I think American is crucial to the
economy, not only of the region, of the state, and I think and hope
that they will remain an independent company.''
   In Washington, Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called Trump's
proposal ``another instance of quick-profit speculation in the
airline industry that is endangering the nation's air
transportation system.''
   Dorgan, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, has
introduced legislation to disallow interest deductions on debt used
for hostile acquisition of an airline.
   ``Loading the half-dozen healthy airline companies up with debt
is placing them in serious jeopardy when we suffer another economic
downturn,'' Dorgan said.

   USX Corp. edged higher Friday in active
trading as the disclosure that investor Carl Icahn has increased
his stake in the company revived speculation that USX may be headed
for a takeover or a restructuring, including the possible sale of
its steel interests.
   USX was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday, closing up 12{ cents at $38.50 after more than 4.8
million shares changed hands.
   Late Thursday, Icahn disclosed that he had raised his stake in
USX to 13.06 percent from 11.41 percent, confirming recent rumors
that he was intensifying pressure on the company.
   Icahn's sale of a record 42-million share block of Texaco Inc.
stock for $2 billion last June led to reports he again was eyeing
USX.
   The investor made a $7.19 billion, or $31-a-share bid, offer for
USX in early 1987, but dropped the bid after the USX board rejected
it. When he made his bid, there were charges he only wanted to
drive up the stock price and profit from it, but he did not sell
his shares when he abandoned the offer.
   In a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Icahn, who owns Trans World Airlines Inc., said a group
he leads wants to explore a ``meaningful restructuring that would
substantially enhance shareholder value.''
   Icahn's purchase of $155 million worth of shares in the steel
and energy company this week has raised his stake in USX to 13.06
percent, or 33.6 million shares, from 11.41 percent.
   ``He obviously wants to force the company into doing something
... but whether he just wants to move the price of the stock, we
don't know. That's the $64 question,'' said Greg Drahuschak, an
analyst for Butcher &amp; Singer of Pittsburgh. ``Whatever it is, it's
a little more than saber rattling.''
   Icahn and USX declined to comment on his latest move. In his SEC
filing, Icahn said USX's market price doesn't reflect the value of
its assets and businesses, and he is studying a buyout financed by
a ``business combination.''
   ``There are some interesting phrases in the filing ... is he
making political statements or are they fair warning of things to
come?'' Drahuschak said. ``It's very improbable that Icahn alone
would be willing to move on USX ... but the `business combination,'
is that a political game or a statement of reality?''
   USX stock surged early this week on speculation Icahn was
increasing his stake and USX's announcement it would sell its
shares of Texas Oil &amp; Gas, valued by analysts at $1.5 billion.
   Rather than make a renewed bid for a fullscale takover, Icahn
could be prodding USX's new chairman, Charles A. Corry, to speed up
a restructuring or to sell major assets, analysts said. Icahn has
long advocated a spinoff of USX's steel division, formerly known as
United States Steel.
   Some analysts, including Andy Gray of Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette Securities Corp. of New York, say USX stock is undervalued
and might be worth $60 a share if assets are sold.
   Others consider it fully valued at $35 to $40 a share, citing
debt liabilities estimated at nearly $6 billion and a softening
steel market.
   ``He could be acquiring just enough to speed up the
restructuring,'' Gray said. ``The bottom line scenario is he was
getting impatient ... (USX) hasn't had a major restructuring
involving billions of dollars in assets in quite a few years.''
   Corry said proceeds from the Texas Oil &amp; Gas sale would be used
to decrease USX's debt and buy back shares, thus increasing
shareholder value. Gray speculates USX may use the $1.5
billion-plus revenues to buy back Icahn's shares. Icahn has said he
is not seeking a better deal than other shareholders.
   No matter what Icahn's ultimate objective is, his latest move
likely will accelerate action by USX, Drahuschak said.
   Corry reportedly was in New York on Friday, possibly to meet
with Icahn, steel industry sources said.
   ``USX has been one of the weakest-performing Dow Jones stocks
for years and its institutional holders have not been
compensated,'' Drahuschak said.
   ``They're at the point in time where they want their due.
They've been patient enough,'' he said.

   The stock of petroleum giant Chevron Corp.
continued its climb Friday, jumping to $66 a share from $64.75, but
company officials had ``no comment'' on reasons for the increase.
   The stock has been moving up, partly in response to a recent
article in Business Week magazine that quoted an industry analyst's
report estimating the company's breakup value at $116 per share.
   ``We never comment on market rumors or speculation,'' said
company spokesman Larry Shushan.
   The magazine article quoted Fred Leuffer, a veteran oil analyst
at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. Leuffer could not be reached for
comment on Friday. The article said Leuffer ``believes that British
Petroleum is interested in Chevron's five West Coast refineries,
which he values at nearly $3 billion.''
   John Andes, a spokesman for BP America in Cleveland, also had
``no comment.''
   ``Our policy is that if we have something to announce we will,''
he said.
   Steve McLennan, investor-relations manager for Chevron, would
not comment on Friday and did not return telephone calls.
   Chevron has sold $6.2 billion of assets since 1984 and has
several other current candidates for divestiture, including Alaskan
refining-and-marketing operations.

   The largest decline in payrolls at auto plants
and other factories in nearly seven years helped push the nation's
jobless rate to 5.3 percent in September, the government said in a
report showing unexpected softness in the economy.
   The civilian unemployment rate was up from 5.2 percent in both
July and August, the Labor Department said Friday.
   Non-farm employers told the government they added a seasonally
adjusted 209,000 jobs in September, more than double a revised
88,000 in August. But nearly all of the growth can be attributed to
special factors.

<HEAD>Defectors Agree to Pay $7 Million to Settle Ad Agency Breakaway Case</HEAD>

   The advertising executives who caused an
industry uproar 19 months ago when they defected from the Lord
Geller Federico Einstein agency to set up their own shop agreed
Friday to settle a legal dispute arising from the walkout by paying
their former employer $7 million.
   The agreement brings to an abrupt and inconclusive end a series
of legal claims and counterclaims, including accusations of
business sabotage that had been closely watched by leaders in the
advertising business.
   ``The settlement does not suggest admission of wrongdoing by any
of the parties and is intended to avoid the expense and distraction
that would accompany continued litigation,'' the four firms
involved in the case said in a brief statement announcing the
settlement.
   Those involved in the settlement are Lord Geller and its owner,
WPP Group PLC of London, the new agency Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp;
Partners and its 49 percent partner, the ad agency Young &amp; Rubicam.
   Under terms of the settlement, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners
will pay $7 million to WPP Group, the announcement said.
   The disclosure of the settlement came late Friday afternoon, and
efforts to reach officials of the various firms were unavailing.
   Six top Lord Geller executives, including agency founders
Richard Lord and Arthur W. Einstein Jr., walked off the job
unexpectedly on March 18, 1988, and promptly announced the creation
of the new agency, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners. Young &amp;
Rubicam, a privately-held agency, was their partner.
   The defectors had been chafing under the management of WPP
Group, which acquired Lord Geller only eight months earlier as part
of its $566 million buyout of the advertising holding company JWT
Group in July 1987.
   After the walkout, WPP filed suit against the defectors and
their new agency, accusing them of trying to steal clients and
employees from their old agency. A New York state court judge
issued an order prohibiting such activity.
   But Lord Geller lost a huge amount of business, as its billings
shrank to $50 million from a pre-breakaway level of $212 million.
   It lost several important clients, the biggest of which was the
computer giant International Business Machines Corp. Lord Geller
had established a reputation as a creative powerhouse largely
because its work for IBM, including the campaign that used a
Charlie Chaplin-like character using IBM office equipment to bring
order to a chaotic business environmnet.
   As of last March, Lord Geller executives insisted they had
stabilized the agency, which employed about 100 people, down from
320 before the breakup.
   Lord Einstein, on the other hand, had grown from nothing to an
agency with about $75 million in billings and 82 employees after
the first year.

   Federal futures regulators have decided not to
recommend to Congress a proposal that would have allowed them to
make crooked brokers and traders pay restitution to the customers
they cheated.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission rejected a proposal,
3-2, Friday to recommend the plan to the Senate for inclusion in
the CFTC's re-authorization bill.
   Chairwoman Wendy Gramm and commissioners Kalo Hineman and Robert
Davis voted against the proposal noting that there already were
avenues for victims to seek restitution on their own.
   Commissioners Fowler C. West and William Albrecht voted for the
measure.
   The proposal would have given administrative law judges, who
preside at CFTC disciplinary actions, the option of including
restitution of customer losses as a sanction against lawbreakers.
   Currently, administrative law judges can issue cease and desist
orders, prohibit trading, suspend or revoke registration or impose
fines up to $100,000 per violation.
   But West who proposed the restitution plan, noted that none of
those actions ``can bring about reimbursement of losses sustained
by defrauded customers.''
   The proposal also would have directed the CFTC to take customer
losses into account when setting civil penalties.
   West conceded that often violators are put out of business and
there is no money left for anybody.
   ``The new sanctioning weapon I propose today should not be
viewed as sure help to defrauded customers _ no matter how much
they need help,'' he said. ``However, in some cases in which there
are funds in the hands of wrongdoers, such a change in the law
might assist customers to recoup at least something.''

   The five commodities futures exchanges in New
York are considering moving to New Jersey from lower Manhattan, a
relocation that could affect up to 20,000 jobs, exchange officials
say.
   A decision is expected by the end of the year and groundbreaking
could begin next year, with occupancy expected in 1994, a spokesman
for the five exchanges said Friday.
   The five exchanges in New York are the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the Commodity Exchange, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange, the Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange.
   Between 4,000 and 5,000 people work at the exchanges but a
relocation could affect up to 20,000 people overall affiliated with
the New York futures markets.
   They trade a variety of contracts on the future prices of
commodities from oil to orange juice. A futures contract is an
agreement to buy or sell a a fixed amount of a commodity or
instrument at a set price on a future date.
   The exchanges now share a 24,000-square-foot trading floor in
the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan and have offices on
several floors. But officials say the space and technological
capabilities are inadequate.
   In 1985, the five exchanges announced plans to build a new
facility over the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel in lower Manhattan but
the plan was scrapped two years later. Officials began considering
a new site again this year because of crowding.
   The spokesman for the five exchanges, who asked not to be named,
said three sites are under final consideration, two in lower
Manhattan and one in New Jersey, but he declined to specify the
locations. A new building would be constructed on a site between
55,000 square feet and 60,000 square feet.
   The plans were disclosed Friday at a joint news conference by
New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman Z. Lou Guttman and new Nymex
President Patrick Thompson.
   The spokesman said the exchanges are working with New York City
officials in developing financial, design and other plans and the
city officials are seeking to keep the industry in Manhattan.
   Earlier this year, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. announced it was moving
2,600 back-office jobs from Manhattan to a 43-story office tower in
Jersey City, N.J., after rejecting offers from New York to remain.
   The New York exchanges last year accounted for about 23 percent
of all futures contracts traded, dwarfed by the market shares of
Chicago's Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
world's largest futures markets.
