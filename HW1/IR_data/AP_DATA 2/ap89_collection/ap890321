   Supporters of human rights champion Andrei D.
Sakharov succeeded Tuesday in forcing a second round of elections in
the Soviet Academy of Sciences for delegates to the new parliament,
improving Sakharov's chances to run.
   The official Tass news agency said only eight of 23 officially
backed candidates were elected in the first round of voting Tuesday.
Since the academy will have 20 seats in the new 2,250-seat Congress
of People's Deputies, 12 seats will be up for grabs in the next
round of elections.
   Partisans of Sakharov had hoped to defeat some of the official
candidates on the ballot _ approval of the academy's leadership was
needed to run _ and force a new round of voting with Sakharov and
other reform-minded academicians running.
   Although Sakharov had been nominated by 55 institutions for a
seat in the new legislature, his name was not among those placed on
the final candidate list by the academy's leadership.
   Under the new election law, the academy will be forced to select
new candidates and submit them to the membership.
   The voting Tuesday by more than 1,300 academy members and
delegates from top Soviet research institutes took place in the
marble-floored hall of Moscow's Palace of Youth.
   Sakharov, a physicist and dean of the Soviet human rights
movement, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.
   Also Tuesday, the legislative campaign of maverick populist Boris
N. Yeltsin picked up steam as his criticism of bureaucracy and
failed economic reform received a warm welcome in his opponent's
backyard.
   Yeltsin, who has become an anti-establishment symbol in the city
that he once ran as Communist Party chief, criticized the election
law under which he is running, as well as the party itself for
nominating only 100 candidates for its 100 seats in the new
legislature.
   ``We need direct elections, from top to bottom, including for the
presidency,'' the post held by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Yeltsin said.
The party election carried out at a Central Committee meeting last
week ``is not the best example of democracy for our society,'' he
said.
   But Yeltsin said he recognized Gorbachev as the country's leader.
   ``I never have set myself up as an alternative to Comrade
Gorbachev,'' he said.
   His booming voice occasionally cracking from overuse, Yeltsin
spoke and answered questions for three hours in a conference hall at
the giant ZIL factory that is run by Yevgeny Brakov, his opponent in
the March 26 election for a seat representing Moscow in the congress.
   About 1,000 people were on hand, and they greeted Yeltsin warmly.
Workers outside the meeting hall spoke well of Brakov, but said
Yeltsin had more experience and that his support was strong among
the 80,000 workers at the giant conglomeration that produces
limousines, refrigerators and freezers, and a variety of other
durable goods.
   Brakov addressed a campaign rally elsewhere in Moscow.
   Yeltsin's candidacy has been thust into the limelight by what he
says is a campaign organized against him by the current Moscow party
leaders. Supporters have plastered campaign posters on walls all
over the city.
   Last week, the party Central Committee published Yeltsin's speech
that led to his being sacked as Moscow party leader in November
1987, in which he criticized the party's style of leadership and
warned of a possible Stalin-like cult of personality developing
around Gorbachev.
   The Central Committee later formed a commission to investigate
complaints that Yeltsin advocates a multiparty system and holds
other views at odds with party policies.
   Those perceived attacks on Yeltsin led to march through Moscow by
thousands of supporters Sunday and warnings Monday by an Interior
Ministry officials that such demonstrations disrupt public order.
   Yeltsin denied Tuesday he advocates competition for the Communist
Party. However, he said too many topics have been prohibited for too
long.
   ``Society is too dynamic and it is too difficult to say what will
happen in several years,'' Yeltsin said. ``Let's not make this topic
forbidden, and allow it to be discussed in the press.''
   Yeltsin hammered party and government bureaucracy and failed
economic reforms. The party adopted a policy last week to encourage
long-term leases by individual farmers to try to improve the
efficiency of the backward agricultural system and solve the
so-called ``food question.''
   ``We are already approaching the `food question' for the third
time, and all the time it's half-measures, half-measures,'' Yeltsin
said. The Soviet Union is suffering from inflation and a ``rather
dead-end'' economic policy that has eroded the ruble's buying power
by 60 percent, he said.
   One-third of the seats in the congress are reserved for
representatives of the party, its affiliates, and social and
professional organizations. Gorbachev already has been elected as a
delegate from the Communist Party.
   Bovin, a well-known figure in the West, failed to win one of the
10 seats from the Union of Journalists.
   In a separate election from the Union of Writers, editor Sergei
Zalygin of the literary journal Novy Mir and writer Valentin
Rasputin, who stresses ecological issues, were among the 10 selected.

   About 300 leftist guerrillas firing
assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades attacked the country's
main penitentiary Tuesday night, and authorities said three
prisoners and one guard were wounded.
   Vitelio Ramos, commander of Mariona prison outside Mejicanos,
told The Associated Press the rebels attacked from three sides.
   He said they failed to penetrate the prison itself, which is
surrounded by a 12-foot-high cinderblock wall topped with barbed
wire and razor blades, but did cut through the 10-foot-high wire
fence around the complex.
   A heavy exchange of fire lasted about 30 minutes, according to
several combatants. The rebels blew a hole in the prison's southern
wall, and one guard said ``several'' prisoners escaped.
   Ramos said he could not confirm that until the prisoners were
counted.
   Spent shells from AK-47 assault rifles lay scattered where the
rebels paused to fire.
   Ramos said three inmates were wounded, possibly in crossfire, and
one prison guard was seriously wounded.
   Nearly 1,800 men are incarcerated in Mariona. Each year the
prison undergoes a few attacks by rebels waging a 9-year-old war
against the U.S.-backed government.
   The rebels consider dozens of the inmates as political prisoners
and apparently attack the institution with the intention of freeing
them.
   ``Long live the FMLN!,'' some prisoners shouted at journalists
allowed into the penitentiary after the attack.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, is the
rebel army.
   Capt. Manuel de Jesus Ramos, second in command at the prison,
said about 160 guards were at the prison when the attack began at 6
p.m. (7 p.m. EST).
   Reinforcements from the elite Bracamonte army battalion operating
near the prison, seven miles north of San Salvador, arrived soon
after the attack began.
   A Bracamonte lieutenant, who identified himself only as Victor,
said about 150 soldiers reinforced the guards. He also estimated the
attacking force at about 300.
   Two of the three wounded prisoners were able to walk with
assistance. The third was carried out unconscious and soaked with
blood. All were placed on a truck for transport to the hospital.
   Earlier Tuesday, opponents of the right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance said a rebel boycott gave the party the
presidential election victory that means control of all three
branches of the government.

<HEAD>EPA Says Americans Should Be Acting To Reduce Radon In Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   More Americans should be taking action to
reduce the amount of radioactive radon gas in their homes because
long-term exposure to the gas increases the risk of lung cancer,
federal regulators said Tuesday.
   U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials are concerned that
not enough homeowners are taking advantage of methods that can
reduce radon concentrations inside homes to safer levels, the
officials told a national convention of radon monitoring
associations.
   ``We're not seeing as many people mitigating, or fixing the
problem, as we'd like. Our concern is that people may think the
problem is too expensive to fix,'' said Michael Mardis, chief of the
EPA's Washington-based radon mitigation prevention and quality
assurance branch. ``The good news is you can do something about it.''
   Radon is an odorless, invisible gas which is released as a result
of the natural decay of uranium in soil. The uranium degenerates to
form radium, which decays into radon. The gas can filter into houses
from the soil through cracks in foundations and walls that contact
the ground.
   Mardis said the EPA has identified several methods for reducing
radon in homes. Such techniques include sealing of basement cracks
and installation of fans which can suck concentrations of the gas
from under houses.
   He said a homeowner can buy a radon measuring device for $10 to
$25 or hire a contractor to measure and remove the gas. Mardis said
the EPA has distributed to all 50 state health departments a list of
contractors who can measure radon concentrations in homes.
   The EPA also is trying to provide the states with a list of
contractors who can remove radon, Mardis said.
   He said it would cost a homeowner $1,000 to $1,500 to reduce
radon levels in a dwelling. He said that cost is comparable with
expenses for termite treatments or repairs of wet basements.
   ``We're not talking about wet feet. We're talking about lung
cancer cases in children,'' Mardis said. ``I think the big problem
is you can't see radon. You can touch it, you can't smell it ...
people aren't aware of it.''

<HEAD>Activists, Weather And Supply Mean Trouble For Danish Mink Farms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In Denmark, the world's top breeder of
minks for fashion, pelts are selling at below break-even prices this
season. More than just prices are depressed.
   Overproduction, warm weather and a long campaign by animal rights
activisits have pushed many of Denmark's 5,000 mink farms to the
brink of bankruptcy.
   ``The stock market crash started it,'' said Scott Novak, who
represents a New York dealer in exclusive garments, who was here for
an international auction. ``That seemed to end that beautiful run we
had for a few years.''
   It's too early to look for bargains in buying a mink coat off the
rack, however. Sewing the furs into garments is skilled work and
labor costs along with retailers' markups are high, but prices might
drop later on.
   Danish breeders produce 35 percent of all mink furs sold in the
West. Last year 12.4 million mink pelts were sold, up from 9.1
million in 1986. At the same time, falling prices reduced income
from $394 million to $282 million.
   It's hard to determine the damage done by the animal activists,
who at times have sprayed paint on the fur coats of women in the
street.
   ``Certainly they hurt us,'' said Lester Taffer, a 59-year veteran
of the trade. ``They murdered us in Germany and other places.''
   The protests began in the 1960s to save animals in the wild from
trappers, but the scope later widened to breeding animals for their
fur.
   Skimming 0.6 percent of the turnover at auctions, the
London-based International Fur Trade Federation finances a
counter-campaign to promote the fur industry in brochures and films.
   A global fraternity of fur buyers assembled in February near
Copenhagen to bid for raw materials that will become the luxurient
apparel in shops in the fall. The Danish auction house offers the
largest collection of mink pelts in the world.
   Minks were fetching between $15 and $34 per pelt. Two seasons
ago, amid surging garment sales, the same types of pelts brought up
to 45 percent more.
   Mink production has set records.
   ``This year we'll be grading more than 15 million pelts, four
times that of the next largest fur center,'' Peter Krag, president
of Danish Fur Sales, said in an interview.
   Pelts are graded according to sex, size, color, clarity and
quality, creating hundreds of categories.
   The fur business has grown in the last 15 years from small
handicraft shops to a mass-production industry. The Far East
supplies an estimated 40 percent of finished product.
   Danish fur farming began in the 1920s with wild mink imported
from North America and fed on the abundance of fish caught in Danish
waters.
   After World War II mink production rose steadily, and Denmark
rose to become the world leader. Production has tripled since 1980.
Now the glut of mink pelts is threatening many breeders.
   Two warm winters in a row have added to furriers' woes. Everyone
in the trade is praying for an extended late-winter cold snap to
stimulate demand for fur clothing.
   Recovery from the slump in fur sales demands at least two
radically improved seasons. Even a 10 percent reduction would not
raise prices unless demand soars.
   ``The important thing is that sales companies are meeting the
market,'' said William Frick, who represents a major Hong Kong
company.
   ``Hong Kong and other large consumers of raw pelts have thus far
been purchasing conservatively, protecting themselves against a
further drop in prices. Eventually, when the market gains confidence
and orders are placed, we'll see a turnover of garments we've never
seen before. Low prices today will benefit tomorrow's consumer,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Best Picture Nominees Offer Wide Range of Place and Theme</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From 18th-century France to the backroads of
1960s Mississippi to today's corporate Manhattan, the Academy Award
nominees for best picture of 1988 offer a wide range of place and
theme.
   But the front-runner seems to be ``Rain Man,'' the saga of an
autistic savant kidnapped by his cold-hearted brother, which has
already won the Directors Guild award for its director, Barry
Levinson.
   ``Rain Man'' had its problems before production. Dustin Hoffman
was intrigued with playing a retarded man, gifted with a genius for
numbers. The role of the autistic man's brother, a scheming
salesman, was closer to Hoffman's age, but the actor heeded his
agent's advice after Hoffman and Warren Beatty's ``Ishtar''
disaster: Don't put two middle-aged actors on the screen. Hearthrob
Tom Cruise jumped at the chance to act with Hoffman.
   Directors Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollack
undertook ``Rain Man'' in succession; all three withdrew for various
reasons. The project soon began to look like one of those dream
movies that never get made.
   Then Hoffman met Levinson (``Good Morning, Vietnam'') at a
performance of the Cirque de Soleil in Santa Monica, Calif. Levinson
directed ``Rain Man'' under schedule and $2.5 million under the $24
million budget (including an estimated $5 million apiece for the
stars). The film has grossed $126.1 million.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons'' is another film with an unsettled history.
The source material, Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel about sexual
intrigue among French aristocrats, long had been overlooked by a
Hollywood that disfavored costume dramas. ``Don't give me any
pictures where they write with feathers,'' Jack Warner is reported
to have once said.
   When ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' became a hit play in London and
New York, Lorimar Telepictures bought the rights and hired the
playwright Christopher Hampton to write the script. The movie was
filmed in France as Lorimar's fortunes were flagging. Also, Milos
Forman was shooting another version of Laclos' work.
   After British director Stephen Frears had made ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' (the title anglicized for Americans), Lorimar sold out to
Warner Bros. Despite fears the movie would be ditched, Warners has
given it a decent and slow release, hoping for word-of-mouth
support. The gross after 11 weeks: $21.2 million.
   The most controversial of the film nominees is ``Mississippi
Burning,'' a fictionalized account of the investigation of the 1964
murder of three civil rights worker in Neshoba County, Miss. The
Chris Gerolmo script, directed by Alan Parker, tells the story
through the eyes of two FBI investigators, played by Gene Hackman
and Willem Dafoe.
   ``Mississippi Burning'' was attacked by those who participated
and reported the 1964 Freedom Summer. Said author David Halberstam,
who covered the story for the New York Times: ``Parker has taken a
terribly moving and haunting story and he has betrayed it, turned it
into a Martin-and-Lewis slapstick between two cops. It's a bad
movie: `Mississippi False.'''
   ``It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did
not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the
movie could remember,'' said Myrlie Evers, whose activist husband,
Medgar Evers, was murdered by white segregationists outside his
Mississippi home in 1963.
   Gerolmo, not an Oscar nominee, replied: ``I never understood this
to be Hollywood's `civil rights' picture. It's an exciting story
about something important. You see our moral failures and greatness.
It allows us to see America at its very worst and also to see people
who displayed great moral courage.''
   ``Mississippi Burning'' (the FBI code for the case) drew mixed
reviews, several awards and only fair business ($28.8 million in 13
weeks).
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' marks the third collaboration between
actor William Hurt and director Lawrence Kasdan; they also worked
together on ``Body Heat'' and ``The Big Chill.'' In the new film
Hurt plays a travel writer who writes books for people who hate to
travel. His private life is torn between his estranged wife
(Kathleen Turner) and an uninhibited dog trainer (Geena Davis).
   While reviews were generally excellent, some criticized the
passivity of Hurt's character. ``What's wrong with the heroism of a
man who has traveled two inches?'' Hurt replies. ``That two inches
is very profound.''
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' has had a fairly good response at the
box office: $28.8 million in 11 weeks. But receipts have dropped off
in recent weeks.
   ``Working Girl'' gives top billing to Harrison Ford and Sigourney
Weaver, but they are virtually supporting players to third-billed
Melanie Griffith. She plays the central figure of Tess McGill, a
shrewd, ambitious secretary who uses tricks worthy of the CIA to
climb to the top of the corporate ladder.
   The script bounced around 20th Century Fox until it reached Mike
Nichols, who agreed to direct. ``One of the hardest things for a
director to find in the '80s is a good story,'' he says.
   ``Every actress in town wanted this part,'' says Melanie
Griffith. ``You should see the script. I'm on every page.''
   Because Nichols insisted on the little-known Griffith (``you can
see right into her feelings,'' he said), Fox paid big salaries to
Ford and Weaver to assure star value.
   Though some critics twitted ``Working Girl'' as a fairy tale,
most were favorable. Audiences agreed. The gross so far: $54.2
million in 11 weeks.

   George, a 36-year-old former heroin addict who
beat his wife, is lying to himself.
   ``The last altercation got out of hand. But before I could
wrestle the knife from my wife's hand, six cops busted in the door
and arrested me. They didn't even want to listen to my side of the
story.''
   George can tell his story when he's at the Queens Family Conflict
Center, among six other men who have inflicted violence on their
households.
   ``I don't know how hard I hit when I get angry,'' he says. ``How
can I stay without drugs when the person lying in bed is sniffing
all the coke in town. If I continue to be passive, she's going to
bring me down...
   ``She's the one who has to get help or else I'm getting a
divorce.''
   ``If she's the one who needs help for her cocaine problem then
why are you here?'' interrupted group leader Jerome Balcom. Balcom
explained later that George ``kept on straying away from the fact
that he hit his wife.''
   More than 1.8 million women will be punched, kicked or assaulted
with a weapon this year, according to a University of New Hampshire
Family Research Lab study. About 6.25 million will be slapped or
shoved.
   ``That is assuming everyone we interviewed told all,'' said lab
director Murray A. Straus. ``In my judgment, those figures should be
doubled.''
   Experts say protective court orders may give victims of domestic
violence temporary security, but the only prevention lies in
education.
   ``Lack of communication between the sexes and the inability to
communicate without violence causes the abuser to react in the only
way he knows how,'' said Ellie Ludvigsen-Jennings of the city
Probation Department.
   The abusive male is rigid toward sex roles, and has a poor
self-image and an inability to communicate with his spouse, said
Roland Maiuro, a psychologist and director of the Harborview Anger
Management Program in Washington State.
   Seventy-five percent are drug or alcohol addicts and 98 percent
were sexually abused or beaten as children, said Ludvigsen-Jennings.
``We try to stop the pattern before it gets to the point of adult
abuse.
   ``We also help victims and adolescents because once they are
abused they, just like the men, will have the tendency to abuse as
well.
   ``Our goal is to eliminate family violence.''
   Ludvigsen-Jennings and Balcom, commander of court officers for
the state court in Westchester County, started the conflict center
in 1984 in response to an increase in domestic violence in New York
City. Its six full-time staffers and 20 volunteers run 15 programs
on issues linked to family violence, including parenting, alcohol
and drug addiction and child abuse.
   About 4,000 men have participated in five years, some
voluntarily, others under court order.
   ``We try to see them the same day they are referred,''
Ludvigsen-Jennings said. ``You can't treat violence cases like any
other cases, they need immediate intervention or somebody will get
seriously hurt.''
   The aim is to make the abuser understand why he is angry and
teach him how to deal with that aggression. ``We first teach them
that they are responsible for their actions, that they are wrong to
hurt their wives and they should learn to think before acting,''
said Ludvigsen-Jennings.
   Most men don't realize what they have done is wrong, she said.
``The man sees the woman as someone beneath him, someone who should
obey his rules. When she doesn't, he feels he has every right to
`make her' act accordingly.''
   ``When we first get them they are full of denial,'' Balcom said,
``They don't believe they've done anything wrong and they'll justify
it until they're blue in the face.''
   George was typical: ``He was trying to blame his wife's drug
habit for their altercations instead of looking at why he was angry
at her.''
   Group leaders try to convince men they should walk away when they
feel a situation is getting out of control. Eventually, the abuser
should be able to let his wife know when he is approaching a
breaking point, so she can leave before it is too late.
   The breaking point, according to Balcom, can come at any time,
but usually is after the wife becomes independent of the husband.
``Sometimes the wife goes to school, gets a better job, advances
herself. Then the man feels inferior, less in control and less
needed by the wife.''
   Counselors try to replace aggressiveness with assertiveness.
   ``You can't expect an abuser to miraculously be cured of all his
aggressions in a six-week program. It takes time to undo what years
of abuse have done,'' said Ludvigsen-Jennings. If the abuser is
caught early enough, his anger can be controlled. But the more
entrenched the pattern of violence, the greater the possibility it
won't be reversed.
   Spouse abuse is not, at its root, a marital problem _ it is an
anger problem, and even if the couple separates he will most likely
lash out again, she said. ``By not addressing the issue of learning
different ways of seeing one's self and the opposite sex (and) not
addressing the issue of what family violence does, we are dumping
more people into the criminal court system.''

<HEAD>Iranian Deputies Protest Turkey's Ban On Islamic Headgear</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iranian lawmakers demanded a review of
relations with Turkey after a Turkish court prohibited college women
from covering their heads in the Islamic tradition, Tehran radio
reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said a letter signed by 150
Parliament deputies urged the Iranian government ``to adjust
cultural, political and economic ties with Turkey, according to its
treatment of Islam and Moslems.''
   Dozens of Moslem fundamentalists were arrested in Turkey on
Friday following demonstrations in several cities against the
court-imposed ban on Islamic head scarves.
   Turkey's constitutional court last week ruled unconstitutional a
December decision by Turkey's Parliament that women university
students could wear the head scarves.
   Opponents of Parliament's decision consider the scarves symbols
of Moslem fundamentalism and a threat to the secularism guaranteed
in the constitution.
   Iran, which is governed by strict Islamic law, has harshly
criticized the ruling and Turkish foreign ministry officials have in
turn attacked Tehran for becoming involved in the matter.
   The neighbors maintain otherwise friendly relations and are
grouped in a three-member Economic Cooperation Organization together
with Pakistan.

<HEAD>Women Prevented from Joining Volunteer Fire Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLE VERNON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief of a volunteer fire department
says he doesn't want women firefighters in his station house because
it might lead to ``hanky-panky.''
   Two women who have tried to join the North Belle Vernon Fire
Department three times have asked the state to intervene.
   ``I don't have anything against them, except they're female,''
said Chief Robert E. Whitelaw Jr.
   ``When you have women in a fire department, there's the
possibility for hanky-panky,'' he said. ``And even if there wasn't
hanky-panky, people would think there was, and we don't need even
the thoughts of it.''
   Whitelaw said that if women are accepted, he might use his
authority to make them reconsider.
   ``I might require more from the ladies than the men as far as
training and fire school go,'' he said.
   Whitelaw's comments angered Nancy Kinik, 38, and Robin Michael,
33, who have been trying since July to join the department and have
been voted down each time by the all-male organization.
   The most recent vote, on March 13, was 28-7, Mrs. Michael said.
   ``The more I read (the chief's comments), the madder I get,''
Mrs. Kinik said Monday. ``I am a married woman and that just doesn't
look good. I don't know what kind of dirty, sleazy mind he has, but
I don't like him saying that.''
   Both women are married to firefighters who belong to the
department and both men voted in favor of their wives joining.
   Mrs. Kinik and Mrs. Michael filed a sex discrimination complaint
against the fire department with the Pennsylvania Human Relations
Commission. The commission held a hearing in November but has not
issued a decision.
   Company President Roger Nogy said the fire company ``has no
official comment to make in regards to the issue.''
   ``Any comments being made are strictly individual opinions and
should not be misinterpreted as official statements by the fire
department,'' he said.

   Legislative leaders turned thumbs down Monday on a
proposal to pay impeached Gov. Evan Mecham for costs he incurred
preparing for a recall election that was never held.
   Mecham said he would now take his fight to the state Supreme
Court.
   ``I've been trying to do this the peaceful way,'' he said. ``I
guess there's no healing to be done; we have to fight about
everything.''
   Arizona law provides for reimbursement in recall elections, but
Mecham was impeached by the state House of Representatives and
convicted in the state Senate last year before a scheduled recall
election could be held.
   The state Supreme Court cancelled the election after Mecham's
ouster elevated Secretary of State Rose Mofford to the governorship,
but Mecham asked for $269,325 to reimburse him for expenses incurred
before the ouster.
   The House rejected the request last year, but Mecham lobbied
legislative leaders to reconsider the matter this session.
   ``We had our attorneys look at it,'' said John Mawhinney, the
Senate's majority leader. ``This is not a vindictive thing.''
   The lawyers found no instance in any state where an officeholder
was paid expenses for an election that did not occur, Mawhinney said.
   Based on that, House Speaker Jane Hull and Senate President
Robert Usdane concluded that ``there being no recall election, there
is no obligation for the state to pay,'' Mawhinney said.
   Mecham was impeached and ousted last year for misuse of funds and
obstruction of justice.

   Torture and killings of civilians by army
and government intelligence units is increasing in Uganda, Amnesty
International charged today.
   The London-based human rights organization said most reports of
abuses came from northern and eastern Uganda, where government
troops have been battling several rebel groups for the past three
years.
   In its report, Amnesty said about 3,000 alleged political
prisoners are being held without charge or trial, most detained by
the army on suspicion of aiding or belonging to rebel groups.
   Amnesty said President Yoweri Museveni, who came to power in
1986, brought an ``immediate end to the gross human rights
violations inflicted by previous governments'' but recent reports of
rape, torture, murder and illegal detention generally have been
ignored by the government.
   The group called on the Museveni government to investigate the
reports.
   It said it had received a government promise in December to
investigate reports of army killings of unarmed civilians in
northern Uganda but that a month later two Amnesty representatives
checking the investigation's progress were expelled from the area
where the killings reportedly occurred.
   The report noted that Museveni's government established a
commission to investigate human rights abuses during the previous
regimes of presidents Idi Amin and Milton Obote, when hundreds of
thousands of Ugandans were killed by army, intelligence and
paramilitary groups.
   But it said the commission had been hamperep my lack of resources
including stationery, office equipment and transportation and ``in
early 1989 its final report still seemed as far away as ever.''

<HEAD>EPA Scientists Want To Ban Widely Used Insecticide</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: RECASTS lead to reflect that EPA scientists want to bar use,
with no decision made by agency as a whole.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>'NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency
want to bar the use of a highly toxic insecticide on potatoes and
imported bananas because its residue poses a health risk to infants
and children, according to a published report.
   The recommendation to restrict use of the insecticide aldicarb
was made on Jan. 12 by toxicologists from the EPA's pesticide
division, The New York Times reported in Tuesday's editions.
   The uses of aldicarb on 10 other crops would be allowed to
continue under the panel's proposal because the chemical is not used
as heavily on those crops and does not leave as much residue as it
does on potatoes and bananas, according to a copy of the EPA's
recommendation obtained by the Times.
   But the report said the risks ``exceed the benefits when aldicarb
is used on bananas and potatoes.'' The other crops were peanuts,
oranges, grapefruit, limes, sugar cane, soybeans, dried beans,
sorghum, pecans and coffee.
   The document said 15,000 to 50,000 infatO and children a day are
exposed to enough aldicarb to present a risk of getting ill from
eating potatoes.
   One drop of aldicarb absorbed through the skin can kill an adult,
The Times said. In children, exposure in the concentrations found in
some potatoes could cause stomach cramps, nervous disorders,
headaches and other ailments.
   Bananas were said to present a risk to as many as 1,500 infants
and children.
   In 1985, more than 1,000 people reported getting sick in eight
Western states and Canada from California-grown watermelons
contaminated with the chemical.
   The use of aldicarb has been restricted for years in New York,
Rhode Island and Wisconsin because of contamination of underground
water supplies. The EPA has found the chemical, known by its trade
name Temik, in ground water in 22 states. It is used widely in
Idaho, Maine and Washington, the three biggest potato-producing
states.
   Mary Anne Ford, a spokeswoman for Rhone-Poulenc S.A., the French
company that manufactures aldicarb, denied that the chemical is a
hazard on any food crops.
   ``That data does not reflect any risk to any group including
infants and children,'' she said.
   The EPA toxicologists' recommendation was presented to Dr. John
A. Moore, now acting deputy administrator of the agency. He has not
made a formal response to the report, the Times said.

<HEAD>Clark Officially Announces Sabbatical From Eastside High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PATERSON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joe Clark, the high school principal who is
the subject of a hit film depicting his disciplinary methods,
officially announced Monday he will take a paid, six-month
sabbatical.
   Clark, known for carrying a baseball bat and addressing students
at Eastside High School with a bullhorn, said he is considering
writing a book, and is talking with the Bush administration about a
job in Washington. His leave would start in September.
   Don Hamilton, a spokesman for William Bennett, President Bush's
drug czar, said Monday there had been ``preliminary discussions with
Joe Clark, who is an old friend of Bill Bennett's, but no job offer
has been made.''
   Bennett, who was secretary of education in the Reagan
administration, helped bring Clark to national attention last year
with his praise of the principal's get-tough methods.
   But Clark has also been criticized, particularly in the last few
weeks because of a strip show performed during a school assembly
while he was out of town. He approved the show, but says he knew
nothing about the partial nudity. He was suspended for five days.
   Clark made his first announcement of his sabbatical late Friday
through a spokesman but spoke publicly about his decision for the
first time Monday at an early morning news conference on the steps
of his school.
   He blasted the Paterson City Council, which tried to fire him
because of the incident.
   ``In no way am I leaving because of a bunch of impish, insincere
and diabolical council members,'' he said.
   He didn't say if he would return to Eastside after his sabbatical.
   ``I wish him luck,'' said School Board President Elease Evans.
``Eastside will miss Joe Clark. However, Eastside will go on.''
   ``I think Mr. Clark is emotionally and physically exhausted,''
she said, adding that he would bg@velcomed if he wants to return.
   Clark has been busy promoting his hit film, ``Lean On Me,'' which
features his efforts to improve education at the troubled,
drug-ridden school.

   The $14 millio ]ttraction ``Earthquake _ The Big One'' was

   Guests ride trams into what appears to be a [u|way station. Then
the ground shakes, a subway train crashes and a fuel truck careens

   The truck failed to explode at one point Saturday, however,
stopping the ride for 90 minutqs/while workers fixed the problem.
   ``There is a slab of concrete that falls from above and the truck

places. ``Skin Deep,'' starring John Ritter of ``Hooperman,'' earned
$2.6 million and ``Chances Are,'' with Cybill Shepherd of
``Moonlighting,'' earned $2.5 million.

Adventure,'' earning just over $2.5 million, with the failing
``Police Academy 6'' in ninth with $2.3 million and the
three-director ``New York Stories'' in 10th place with $1.6 million.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke, dogged by
questions about his personal life, has tearfully admitted in a
television interview to being unfaithful to his wife of 33 years.
   Hawke told the Channel 7 network's Newsworld program he has
committed adultery but said would do so no longer. Hawke, tears
welling in his eyes, said he loved his wife, Hazel, whom he called
an ``incredible woman.''
   The Labor Party leader said ``she understood that it was part of
a pretty volatile, exuberant character, and she knew my love for her
had never changed.'' He also made references to his past drinking
problems.
   The interview was to be broadcast nationally tonight.
   Hawke must call elections in mid-1990 and he has said he will
seek an unprecedented fourth three-year term as prime minister. His
popularity is believed to be eroding because of rising interest
rates, higher taxes and other economic woes.
   The 59-year-old premier has been followed by questions about his
personal life for years but had never admitted he cheated on his
wife. His stunning confession on national television caused a
sensation.
   ``Bob Hawke In Tears: How I Cheated On Hazel,'' read the headline
in the Sydney Morning Herald. It carried a cartoon portraying Hawke
saying to his wife as she fills in a ballot in a voting booth,
``I've been unfaithful! Do you still love me?''
   Opposition Liberal Party leader John Howard refused comment on
Hawke's admission. Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Bowen said he found
it ``interesting'' but did not elaborate.
   Clover Moore, an independent member of the Sydney Council, said
she thought many women would be angry about infidelity admission.
   ``I think it's very cruel of him to publicly humiliate his
wife,'' she said. ``I think the majority of women would think it is
in very bad taste to put Hazel through such a public demonstration.''
   The couple celebrated their 33rd wedding anniversary two weeks
ago.
   The interview was the second time Hawke has broken down on
national television while making a personal admission. In 1984, he
began crying when he referred to drug problems among members of his
family.
   Mrs. Hawke later went on television to explain that their
daughter, Roslyn, and her husband, Matt, had been treated for heroin
addiction.
   Hawke gave no details about his sexual liaisons in the interview,
a transcript of which was released by both Channel 7 and the prime
minister's office.
   A spokesman for Hawke said the admission was not new. ``All this
has been said before,'' said the official, who is not allowed to be
named.
   In the interview, journalist Clive Robertson asked Hawke what
people mean when they accuse him of being a womanizer.
   ``They mean I was unfaithful to my wife,'' Hawke replied.
   Robertson: ``Is that true?''
   Hawke: ``Yes.''
   Robertson: ``Did you stop that?''
   ``Yes,'' Hawke replies in tears, and then, ``I guess there are
not many women who would have put up with me all that time. But my
love for her never changes. I have always loved Hazel, always will.
   Hawke also referred to his past drinking, which his biographer
Blanche d'Alpuget says earned him an entry in the Guinness Book of
Records when he drank 2{ pints of beer in 12 seconds while 3udying
at Oxford University in Britain.
   ``I was never an alcoholic in the sense that I couldn't work,''
said Hawke, who has said he stopped drinking alcohol in 1979. ``I
always worked very hard. It was getting to the stage where at the
end of the day I was looking forward too much to a drink. I thought
that was pretty unintelligent.''

<HEAD>Democrats to Try To Condition Salvador Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Department officials are bracing for
their toughest fight with Congress in years over aid to El Salvador
following presidential elections won by the most right-wing
candidate.
   House Democrats have told the administration they will attempt to
impose tight conditions on aid to El Salvador in hopes of pressuring
the country to improve its human rights performance and negotiate
peace with leftist guerrillas.
   One Democratic faction, led by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., would
release the aid in increments, threatening to cut off the money at
any time if El Salvador does not meet requirements set forth in
legislation.
   A State Department official, insisting on anonymity, called this
approach ``unbelievable micromanagement'' on Monday and said the
administration will attempt to keep the aid program as free of
conditions as possible.
   Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
foreign operations, was not available Monday for comment on his
legislative plans.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was expected to be asked
about the aid issue today during testimony before a House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee.
   In El Salvador, the Arena party candidate, Alfredo Cristiani, won
a lopsided victory over Fidel Chavez Mena of the ruling Christian
Democratic party in Sunday's election.
   The United States has provided $3.5 billion in aid to El Salvador
during this decade but many lawmakers are becoming restive about
increasing human rights violations there and government's inability
to negotiate a settlement to the war.
   Adding to the concern is that the Arena party has been linked to
rightist death squads. One of the most prominent leaders in the
party is Roberto D'Aubuisson, who was described by former U.S.
Ambassador Robert White as a ``pathological killer.'' In 1980, the
Carter administration stripped D'Aubuisson of his U.S. visa.
   Cristiani insists he'll be his own man as president and will not
be beholden to D'Aubuisson and his allies. The success of the
administration in obtaining approval for Salvador aid without
conditions depends on Cristiani's ability to disassociate himself
from D'Aubuisson, according to government officials.
   The administration contends that the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation guerrilla movement has refused to enter into serious
negotiations on ending the war. As for rights abuses, officials
contend that politically motivated killings are only a small
fraction of what they were in the 1980-82 period.
   Until 1984, the Reagan administration endured one clash with
C/oress after another over aid to El Salvador because of widespread
rights violations. It was not until the election of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte in 1984 that the administration was able to win
bipartisan support on that issue.
   The State Department said Monday it is prepared to continue
supporting El Salvador but only so long as the government respects
democracy and protects human rights.
   Department spokesman Charles Redman praised the Salvadoran people
for having braved ``violence and terror'' which he blamed on the
guerrillas.
   At least 29 guerrillas and soldiers were killed in fighting
Sunday, as well as two civilians. Three journalists _ two
Salvadorans and a Dutchman _ also were killed by government security
forces over the election weekend.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
judgments about human rights will be a ``very important factor'' in
guiding U.S. policy toward El Salvador.

   The Hollywood that insider Carrie Fisher knows
best is a place full of stereotypes where actors can't get respect.
   ``Hollywood is still a sexist business,'' the daughter of Debbie
Reynolds and Eddie Fisher says in the April issue of Cosmopolitan
magazine.
   ``The most successful businesswomen are considered to be
masculine. ... What would be regarded as good business qualities in
men are put down in women.''
   Fisher, who played Princess Leia in the ``Star Wars'' movies and
wrote a roman a clef about her days as a drug addict, ``Postcards
From the Edge,'' says she was amazed at how her fellow professionals
were treated.
   ``And actors are the lowest of the low, unless they're `box
office,' in which case they're treated with respect without being
respected,'' she said. ``It's just the stupidest profession, I'm
telling you. You're not only not allowed to grow old gracefully,
you're not allowed to grow old at all.''

   Asked why women are attracted to him, the ``Miami Vice'' star

   Actor Todd Bridges must face trial on a charge
of attempted murder in the shooting of a convicted drug dealer at a
cocaine hangout, a judge has ruled.
   Municipal Judge David Horwitz also declined to reduce the $2
million bail for the former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star, despite a
defense lawyer's plea that Bridges should be freed from jail so he
can make commercials warning young people about drugs.
   ``The defendant is held to answer,'' the judge declared Monday
after a hearing in which people testified the 23-year-old actor was
high on cocaine for weeks before the shooting. ``The bail will
stand.''
   Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran had sought to reduce the
attempted murder charge by claiming that the actor was too drugged
to have planned to kill someone.
   Kenneth Clay, the victim, said Bridges was ``based out'' from
freebasing or smoking cocaine on Feb. 2, the day of the shooting.
   ``It was the worst I seen him,'' said Clay. ``He looked like his
eyes were about to jump out of his head.''
   Bridges appeared in a blue jail uniform.

   Comedian Whoopi Goldberg joined seven
battered women in an appeal for action to curb domestic violence.
   ``It's something people don't want to talk about,'' Goldberg said
Monday. ``The attitude is, if a man hits his wife, it's his wife.
Well, we're here to say we're not anyone's property any more.''
   Goldberg, in Charlotte to do her one-woman show ``Living on the
Edge of Chaos,'' appeared at a news conference sponsored by the N.C.
Coalition Against Domestic Violence.
   The news conference was called in the wake of a March 10 hostage
incident in which a husband held women and children for 13 hours in
a battered women's center in Lenoir, about 75 miles northwest of
Charlotte.
   Goldberg said the incident was an example of the pervasiveness of
domestic violence.
   ``This is happening in households across the country every day,''
she said. ``This can visit you any time. It could be your sister,
your mother, your daughter or son.''
