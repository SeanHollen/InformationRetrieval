   Idahoans are sending potato farming
gear to Poland in a gesture of support for the democratic movement
in eastern Europe, a congressman said.
   About 30 pieces of equipment, including potato diggers and
planters, will be sent initially, Democratic Rep. Richard Stallings
said, noting the spud is as central to Polish agriculture as it is
to farming in Idaho, the nation's biggest potato grower.
   ``We are witnessing events in Eastern Europe of historic
proportions, and they started in Poland,'' Stallings said at a news
conference Friday. ``We want to see these events succeed.
   ``Folks in Washington are scratching their heads trying to
decide how best to respond ... In the meantime, Idahoans are moving
ahead with practical solutions.''
   Morrison Knudsen, a Boise-based engineering, mining and
construction company, agreed to ship the equipment to the East
Coast, where charitable organizations will ship it to Poland,
Stallings said.

   Vietnam told Britain that it rejects
the forced repatriation of refugees from Hong Kong and reserved the
right to send them back to the British colony, official Vietnamese
media reported Friday.
   A Foreign Ministry official handed a note on the issue to
British ambassador to Hanoi Emrys Davies, said a Vietnam News
Agency report in Bangkok.
   A group of 51 Vietnamese were flown from Hong Kong to Hanoi on
Tuesday in the first repatriation of boat people against their will.
   However, Vietnamese authorities accepted the group back and the
official media said without clear explanation that the repatriation
was ``part of the framework'' of Vietnam's policy of rejecting
forced repatriation.
   According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Foreign Ministry note
strongly affirmed the policy of rejecting forced repatriation and
``and only accepting those who volunteer to return or who are not
opposed to the repatriation.''
   It said the ministry official cautioned Davies that ``any
violation of these principles may hamper and even completely
disrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step by
step'' as agreed to at the multilateral conference on Indochinese
refugees held in Geneva in June.
   The agency said the ministry official stressed that ``if Vietnam
discovers any case of `forced repatriation,' it reserves the right
to return them to Hong Kong.''
   Many of the 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong Kong
since June 1988 are considered illegal ``economic migrants'' unless
they can prove they fled their Communist homeland fearing
persecution.
   Thousands have held demonstrations to protest the decision by
Britain its colony to force the return of the refugees, a decision
condemned by the United States.

<HEAD>Scientists Find 225-Million-Year-Old Fossil Bed in Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists excavating an ancient lake shore in
Virginia say a concentration of fossils there dates from a time
when the area was a lush tropical forest and creatures resembling
armored monsters roamed the Earth.
   Hans-Dieter Sues, a Smithsonian Institution paleobiologist, said
Thursday that the rich collection of fossil remains are from a
variety of animals that lived 225 million years ago and some are of
a type never before found.
   ``Many of these are not known because rocks from this particular
chunk of time are not found anywhere else in the world,'' said Sues
in an interview. ``This is the first time that we've got a really
diverse group of land animals from this part of geologic time.''
   Sues said the largest assembled fossil includes the body, but
not the head, of a five-foot-long reptile resembling an
armor-plated crocodile.
   ``This creature had two rows on its back of this very massive
bony plate and huge spines sticking out on the side,'' said Sues.
``It's like something from a Japanese monster movie. It is a
funny-looking creature and an entirely new type of animal.''
   Sues said the Triassic period fossils were found in a formation
of stone called mudrock about 15 miles southwest of Richmond.
   The assemblage includes many fossils from a group of animals
called cynodonts, the closest reptile ancestors of the mammal. Sues
said the fossils include parts for a cynodont about the size of a
small dog, and other parts from a mammal-like reptile measuring 5
to 10 inches long.
   Sues said fragments of fossils of this type have been found in
the northern hemisphere, but never in such a large group.
Individual cynodont fossils also have been found in Argentina,
Brazil and in southern Africa.
   ``This is further evidence for the super continent of Pangaea,
when all of the continents were one large giant land mass,'' he
said, because fossils from the same species and the same era can be
found on continents that now are separated.
   It is thought that during the geologic period called Triassic,
between 240 to 205 million years ago, all of the Earth's land area
was connected in one large mass called Pangaea. The land mass
slowly split apart, as massive plates drifted away from each other
over millions of years, and the continents and islands eventually
arranged themselves in their present positions.
   Sues said that when the cynodonts and other creatures lived in
what is now Virginia, the area was near the equator and the climate
was tropical and humid, with lush vegetation.
   ``You had these huge fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the
whole area,'' he said. ``You had an incredible variety of animals.
There were plant eaters and a whole variety of meat eaters.''
   Sues said the cynodont fossils found in the assemblage include
five very small jaw bones, apparently from hatchlings, six larger
jaw bones, and the back bone and head from a still-larger animal.
   ``The cynodonts were creatures that were the precursors for true
mammals,'' he said. ``They are not mammals themselves, but were
species that gave rise to mammals.''
   One of the small jaw fossils is attached to a detailed mold of
the brain, and Sues said this may enable scientists to learn more
about how the mammalian brain developed.
   Most of the Triassic period reptiles died out as dinosaurs began
to evolve into the dominant animal, around the time the first
mammal is thought to have evolved.
   ``This find gives further evidence that mammals and dinosaurs
probably evolved at the same time,'' Sues said. ``The dinosaur
became very successful and remained successful for the next 140
million years and mammals were sort of pushed over the side and
only became important and successful after the dinosaurs went
extinct.''
   Dinosaurs became extinct, for reasons still not understood,
about 65 million years ago, and mammals, such as mankind, evolved
into the dominant animal.
   The fossil deposit was found by Paul E. Olsen, a geologist with
the Columbia University Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.
   Olsen was conducting a survey in the area in 1985, Sues said,
and chanced onto a small fossil. Sues identified it as a cynodont
part and the National Geographic Society supported further
exploration leading to the discovery of the large fossil deposit.

   Three members of Congress want to know if the
National Institutes of Health are making good on a promise to stop
testing only men when seeking cures to diseases that also affect
women.
   Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., on Thursday asked the General Accounting
Office to investigate a policy adopted in 1987 after a report from
the Public Health Service showed sex discrimination at NIH clinical
tests.
   ``The gender bias in medical research isn't confined to the lab;
it filters down to the health care that women receive,'' said
Schroeder.
   ``If a woman wants to know if she should take an aspirin every
other day to help prevent heart disease or take a
cholesterol-lowering drug to bring down her cholesterol level, her
doctor won't have the answer. All of the research in this area has
been done on men,'' said the congresswoman.
   She was referring to two studies that were highly criticized for
excluding women _ the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trials,
which studied coronary disease risk factors, and the Physician's
Health Study, which inspected use of aspirin as preventive therapy
for coronary disease.
   Both studies were started before 1987.
   Snowe said she feared the treatments developed from these
men-only studies might be useless or even harmful when applied to
women.
   ``The National Institutes of Health are aware of this problem,
but we want to know what success they've had in including more
women in medical research,'' said Snowe. ``After all, you don't
test apples to see what happens to oranges.''
   The institutes, which together have a $7.68 billion budget, are
funding hundreds of studies on their Bethesda, Md., campus and
through grants to universities and private companies throughout the
country. They comprise the nation's largest medical research agency.
   Dr. Millicent Higgins, who helps decide who will do research for
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at NIH, said
observational studies were including women all along. The problem
was in experimentation.
   ``The studies started recently include women,'' she said. But
she said the GAO audit will determine the degree to which women are
involved in clinical testing.
   The policy established by NIH in 1987 did not have any target
date or quotas for increasing women in clinical tests.
   A research official in another institute at NIH said she didn't
think women were being excluded intentionally.
   ``It was like everything else in our society,'' said Dr.
Florence Hazeltine, director of the Center for Population Research
within the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development. ``Women are second-class citizens so they are thought
of second.''
   Hazeltine said that because men dominate medical research they
often study problems related to themselves.
   ``We've heard this for several years,'' said Howard Lewis, of
the American Heart Association. ``I think the people making the
decisions are getting the message.''
   Schroeder, Snowe and Waxman said they want the GAO report by
April, before Waxman's Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health
and the environment begins authorization hearings of the NIH budget
for the next fiscal year.
   Among the questions asked by the members of Congress are:
   _Has NIH refused to issue any grants because the applications
did not comply with the policy to include women?
   _Have any grants been given waivers?
   _What is the cost of including women in clinical tests? What are
the cost implications of continuing to exclude them?
   _What are the gender, race, ethnic origin and age of the people
used in clinical trials? Which studies used predominantly one
gender, race, ethnic group or age group?

<HEAD>Marcos Knew of Conspiracy That Led to Murders, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RORY MARSHALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos had ``full knowledge'' of an
intelligence conspiracy that led to the 1981 murders of two
anti-Marcos activists in Seattle, a lawyer told jurors Thursday.
   But a defense attorney said that although it's easy to see the
late Philippines dictator as ``the personification of excess and
evil,'' no evidence indicates the deaths of Silme Domingo and Gene
Viernes were caused by anything other than a local union dispute.
   The lawyers' comments came during closing arguments in a civil
lawsuit accusing Marcos, his widow, Imelda, and others of running
an intelligence network that harassed and intimidated anti-Marcos
elements in this country.
   Plaintiffs claim defendant Dr. Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco
ran an intelligence slush fund for Marcos that paid for the
murders, and that the payoff was delivered to the killers by
defendant Tony Baruso, who was president of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union.
   Domingo and Viernes, who were reformist officers of the union,
were shot in its offices on June 1, 1981.
   Marcos' intelligence network ``ran amok'' and Marcos did nothing
to stop it, plaintiffs' attorney Michael Withey said.
   Marcos ``had full knowledge of the conspiracy and not only
foresaw but condoned acts of harassment and physical violence''
against his opponents in the United States, Withey told the U.S.
District court jury that is hearing the case against the Marcoses.
   Judge Barbara Rothstein will judge the liability of five other
defendants in the lawsuit, which seeks millions of dollars in
damages for the victims' survivors.
   Withey said the murders were ``made to look like a union dispute
_ hot-headed Filipinos shooting it out, vicious thuggery.'' But
evidence clearly showed Marcos headed an extensive intelligence
network not only in the Philippines but in the United States, he
said.
   ``We're talking about so many spy agencies you can't even count
them all,'' Withey said.
   At the start of the trial Thanksgiving week, Marcos defense
lawyer Richard Hibey had painted Domingo and Viernes as small fry
in the anti-Marcos movement, laboring in ``a smaller vineyard''
than more prominent activists.
   But Withey noted Viernes had traveled to the Philippines to meet
with ``the largest and most threatening labor organization Marcos
had ever encountered,'' and that both men had sponsored a
resolution critical of Marcos at a Hawaii labor convention.
   ``Mr. Hibey may have thought the vineyard was small, but
Ferdinand Marcos knew better,'' Withey said.
   Three men linked to a Filipino gang were convicted of murder on
the theory that Domingo and Viernes were victims of an internal
union dispute over work assignments and gambling in Alaska fish
canneries.
   ``There was turmoil in this union. There were bribes, there was
violence, there were gangs, there was murder,'' Hibey said.
   ``Sure, it's easy to look upon Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos as
the personification of excess and evil. That's what the case
panders to,'' he said.
   ``Don't be so blinded by it to seize on the target of two
incredibly unpopular people and hold them accountable for that
which is not theirs to account.''
   But Withey said evidence didn't support that explanation.
   ``The evidence establishes that Domingo and Viernes were far
more than anti-Marcos activists who happened to be killed in an
unrelated dispute,'' he said. ``They were very active and effective
anti-Marcos activists.''
   The jurors must decide whether the Marcoses were part of a
conspiracy that led to the murders and whether they were negligent
in exercising control over their intelligence network.
   Rothstein on Thursday granted a motion by the Philippines
government to be dismissed from the suit.
   In a videotaped deposition made before his death last September,
Marcos, who was overthrown in February 1986, took the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when asked about his
connections with Malabed.

<HEAD>USDA Predicts 1990 Will be a Better Year for Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of bankers shows them to be in basic
agreement with Agriculture Department experts that 1990 will be a
brighter year for farmers and the rural economy.
   The USDA projects some improvement in net cash income of
farmers, perhaps to around $54 billion or so, compared with an
estimated $53 billion this year.
   Net cash income is the money farmers have left over from gross
cash earnings after paying cash expenses.
   Department economists also predict 1990 increases in farmland
prices, farm assets and equity values, which are important
indicators of financial condition.
   ``Overall, the financial condition of farmers is stronger now
than at any other time in the last several years,'' says the
department's Economic Research Service. ``This is largely due to
cautious investment behavior, effective cost control, increased
cash financing, and continued restructuring and write-offs of
outstanding debt.''
   The American Bankers Association said its survey of 60 bankers
at the group's annual conference last month in St. Louis, Mo.,
indicated optimism for the rural economy in 1990. Sixty percent
said they were optimistic about the outlook for the rural economy.
Eight percent said it would worsen.
   In general, the bankers said they believe farmers next year
``will plant more acreage, use fewer chemicals, sell more products
to foreign markets, sign up for more crop insurance and increase
their use of computers'' for their records.
   About 48 percent of the bankers responding to the survey said
competition from other banks and the Farm Credit System would be
the biggest issue for them in 1990. Rural development was second
with 28 percent.
   The bankers were not so optimistic about the use of the Farmers
Home Administration's guaranteed loan program. Half said they
expect to make fewer FmHA-guaranteed loans next year, while 25
percent said they expected an increase and 25 percent no change.
   ``The results apparently reflect the bankers' concerns over what
they consider to be the burdensome paperwork involved in the
program,'' the association said.
   But when it comes to ending federal subsidies to farmers, 67
percent of the bankers said they were opposed to scrapping the
payments.
   ``Nearly all of the bankers surveyed (95 percent) said, so far,
they have not had to pay for cleanup costs on environmentally
contaminated collateral or property,'' the association reported.
``Likewise, a majority (93 percent) of the bankers said animal
rights laws have not affected whether they would make a loan.''
   The American Bankers Association calls itself ``the national
trade and professional association for America's commercial banks
of all sizes. Assets of ABA member banks are about 95 percent of
the industry total.''

   The Republic of Singapore has produced its
first litter of test-tube pigs, a step the island nation hopes will
lead to a supply of genetically superior swine for Southeast Asia.
   A report by the Agriculture Department's trade officer in
Singapore said the potential market for such breeder pigs is
estimated at 1.8 million sows, or $270 million, in Southeast Asia
alone.
   ``Companies in Britain, Australia and the United States have
expressed a keen interest in using Singapore as an agrotechnology
service base,'' the report said.
   Singapore is eliminating traditional methods of pork production,
which require extensive land use and create pollution.
   ``The birth of the piglets marks the beginning of efforts to
modernize production and to create a stock of elite, genetically
superior breeding pigs, which can be built up for mass production
throughout the region,'' the report said.
   Veterinary surgeons implanted a surrogate sow with donated
embryos last spring, resulting in the birth of seven offspring in
September.
   The report said the surrogate mother can be adapted to local
conditions, allowing her to pass on antibodies to local diseases to
her young. Because the risk of disease is reduced, the chance of
survival is increased.
   Also, the cost of transporting embryos is less expensive than
live animals, and disease transmission is minimized.

   The Soviet Union bought U.S. poultry meat this
year for the first time in a decade, but Agriculture Department
analysts say the future potential of the Soviet market is uncertain.
   Sale of 33 million pounds of broiler ``leg quarters'' this fall
was the first since 1980, and that one was halted by the partial
embargo ordered by then-President Carter in retaliation for the
Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.
   Thus, said the department's Economic Research Service, there had
not been actual shipments of U.S. poultry meat to the Soviet Union
since 1977.
   ``Broader Soviet policies toward providing consumer goods and
U.S. prices relative to European broiler prices will be among the
factors influencing future sales,'' the agency said. ``Russia
traditionally imports poultry meat from Eastern European countries,
primarily Hungary, and is expected to continue such arrangements.''
   In 1988, Hungary exported almost 70 percent of the estimated 395
million pounds of poultry imported by the Soviet Union.

Fees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich is
appealing to his past campaign contributors to help pay more than
$125,000 in legal fees for preparing his defense against ethics
charges.
   Rich Galen, a spokesman for the Georgia congressman, said
Thursday that Gingrich sent an urgent fundraising letter last week
to some 12,000 previous contributors seeking help with his legal
bills.
   Two Washington attorneys, former Arkansas Rep. Ed Bethune and
Dan Swillinger, have been preparing a defense so Gingrich will be
ready if the House ethics committee decides to launch a formal
investigation of two complaints filed against him by Rep. Bill
Alexander, D-Ark., Galen said.
   ``It's like buying insurance,'' the spokesman said. ``You hope
you don't have to use it.''
   The ethics committee has taken no formal action on either
complaint. The first alleges that Gingrich violated House rules and
federal campaign finance laws by getting 21 investors to put up
$5,000 each to promote his 1984 book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   An outside counsel hired to evaluate that complaint concluded in
October that there were not sufficient grounds for the panel to
investigate Gingrich, who was elected House GOP whip after filing
the ethics complaint that led to the resignation last June of
former Speaker Jim Wright.
   After the outside counsel made its recommendation, Alexander
filed another complaint, along with 670 pages of supporting
documents, accusing Gingrich of ethics and campaign finance
violations in seven new areas.
   Galen said Gingrich sent out the fundraising appeal because he
does not have enough money in his campaign account to pay the
attorneys' bills.
   Gingrich reported to the Federal Election Commission on June 30
that he had $35,847 in leftover debts from his 1988 re-election
campaign and a cash balance in his 1990 campaign account of $50,297.

   A veterans group is suing country singer
Lee Greenwood for refusing to perform at a concert when the group
refused to pay in cash upfront.
   The federal suit, filed Wednesday by the Veterans of the Vietnam
War, says Greenwood was hired in April to perform at a concert in
Albany, Ga., on Aug. 18. He received an $11,250 check and was to
get the balance on the day of the concert.
   On that day, Greenwood allegedly demanded the balance in cash,
despite the contract's provision for payment by check, and refused
to perform. The suit claims he also failed to provide sound and
lighting equipment, preventing other bands from performing.
   The veterans group lost about $228,000 as a result of his
actions, the suit claims.
   Greenwood disputed the allegations Thursday, saying the group
had promised him a 30-day promissory note, not a check.

   Author Nicholas Gage says his writing skills
were unleashed in a chance encounter with a salty-tongued teacher
when he was a struggling, 13-year-old refugee.
   Gage writes in the Dec. 17 issue of Parade magazine how as a
seventh-grader he met Marjorie Hurd Rabidou in Worcester, Mass.
   Told to choose a hobby, Gage said he ``decided to follow the
prettiest girl in my class _ the blue-eyed daughter of the local
Lutheran minister.''
   ``She led me through the door marked `Newspaper Club' and into
the presence of Miss Hurd, the newspaper adviser and English
teacher who would become my mentor and my muse.''
   Gage wrote an essay for the school paper about his mother, who
was killed by Communists during the Greek civil war. Hurd sent it
to the Freedoms Foundation in Valley Forge, Pa., where it won a
medal.
   Gage was a reporter for The New York Times and later recorded
his mother's life and death in the book ``Eleni,'' and his father's
story in ``A Place for Us.''

   Former Olympic gymnastics champion Olga
Korbut has been campaigning to raise money for a group bringing
young leukemia victims from the Soviet Union.
   The first of the Soviet children, 5-year-old Irina Chechkovsky,
is expected to arrive in Indianapolis within two weeks, said Mary
Maxwell, a spokeswoman for Riley Children's Hospital.
   Irina became sick apparently because of exposure to high levels
of radiation from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant. She may undergo a bone marrow transplant, Maxwell said.
   Korbut lives in Minsk, the Soviet city where the girl is from.
   Winner of three gold medals during the 1972 Olympics, Korbut
made more than a dozen public appearances over several days to
appeal for donations to the Emergency Fund for Children Foundation,
created in July to locate and help children around the world
suffering from grave ailments.
   Twelve Soviet children slated to visit Riley in the coming
months will be the first to benefit from the organization's
efforts, Maxwell said.

   Having traveled to Africa and the Amazon
jungle during a 14-month sabbatical, cartoonist Gary Larson should
have even more loopy animals with which to draw his popular cartoon
``The Far Side.''
   The Universal Press Syndicate, which carries Larson's strip,
kept busy during his absence, adding newspapers for a total of more
than 900 that run the cartoon.
   Under his new schedule, Larson will produce five original panels
a week, with reissues of old cartoons for the other two days.
   He said he had mixed feelings about being back at work; the
first new cartoons will be published Jan. 1.
   ``I currently feel fresh and recharged, and a reduced workload
I'm sure will play a big role in maintaining that feeling,'' Larson
said. ``But, as I'm sure anyone who has had an opportunity to take
a full year off will agree, that first Monday morning back to work
is quite a sobering experience.''
   Larson _ whose off-beat, bizarre humor features animated puns,
animals that act like humans and vice versa _ took a break starting
in October 1988. Larson and his wife traveled extensively and spent
four months in New York, where he studied jazz guitar. Their home

   A former Berks County district attorney and
a onetime candidate for mayor in Reading were indicted Thursday on
federal charges of supplying chemicals to three Reading-area drug
operations.
   J. Michael Morrissey, who served as Berks County district
attorney from 1976-80, and Joseph Pastore are charged with
conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine and phenyl-2-propanone,
or P2P, a key ingredient in methamphetamine.
   The indictment says Morrissey, a practicing attorney, and
Pastore delivered chemicals, laboratory equipment and recipes for
methamphetamine or P2P to drug manufacturers from June 1985 to
February 1986.
   Three others named in the indictment were not charged.
   Pastore's lawyer, Emmanuel H. Dimitriu, refused to comment on
the indictment. Morrissey's lawyer, William Bernhart, did not
return telephone calls for comment.
   Mary Vaira of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration
described Morrissey as a ``broker.''
   According to the indictment, in June 1985, Morrissey delivered
phenyl acetic acid, an ingredient of P2P, to Arthur Auchenbach, who
was charged separately Thursday with manufacturing P2P.
   Pastore and two others not charged delivered about 200 pounds of
phenyl acetic acid in December 1985 to a farm in Bethel Township,
according to the indictment. Pastore also provided drug
manufacturers with the telephone numbers of individuals supplying
P2P to Morrissey, the indictment says.
   The indictment also charges Morrissey, 51, of Myerstown with one
count of aiding and abetting the manufacture of P2P. Pastore also
is charged with distributing one quart of P2P.
   If convicted on all counts, Morrissey faces a maximum penalty of
60 years imprisonment and a fine of $500,000; Pastore, 65, of West
Reading faces a maximum penalty of 30 years and a $250,000 fine;
and Auchenbach faces a maximum penalty of 20 years and a $1 million
fine.
   Marrissey and Pastore were scheduled for arraignment Friday in
Philadelphia before Magistrate William F. Hall, said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Lee J. Dobkin.

<HEAD>Job Market Survey Shows Good Growth for College Grads Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH NORDGREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College graduates in 1990 can look forward to a
job market much like 1989's _ a year of good growth _ with
engineering students pulling in the highest starting salaries,
according to an annual survey released Thursday.
   But the author of the survey said the 260 businesses surveyed
were more cautious in their economic outlook than they were a year
ago, with 44 percent saying they expected business to be about the
same and 6 percent predicting a decline. Fifty percent said they
expected a slightly better business climate in 1990.
   ``This is a rather unusual balance _ a decidedly mixed
outlook,'' said Victor Lindquist, author of the Northwestern
University Lindquist-Endicott Report of 1990.
   ``Although there appears to be economic stability with limited
growth, there is vulnerability in the marketplace,'' said
Lindquist, associate dean and director of placement at the school.
``If a decline in business becomes pronounced and widespread, there
will be an immediate and sudden drop in job opportunities for
college graduates.''
   The 44th annual Lindquist-Endicott report surveyed medium to
large businesses and industrial companies. Among those surveyed
were major employers in banking, finance, merchandising,
electronics and public utilities.
   Lindquist said there is ``a rather good match'' this year
between the number of students entering the job market and the jobs
available. But he predicted by 1992 there will be more jobs than
students, because of a declining pool of students.
   He said that on average, starting salaries for this spring's
graduates would be up 3.9 percent over last spring, lagging
slightly behind inflation. But he noted a new trend in which 24
percent of businesses offered signing bonuses of about $3,000 on
average to students who actually accept jobs.
   Students with engineering degrees can expect to earn an average
$32,304 starting salary, the highest among their peers, the report
said. Those majoring in computer sciences and chemistry are not far
behind, with average starting salaries of $29,100 and $29,088,
respectively.
   Linquist said the outlook should continue to be strong for
computer science majors.
   Accounting majors got the biggest percentage salary increase, up
5.8 percent over last year's figure to an average of $27,408, while
starting salaries in sales-marketing showed the smallest increase,
up .2 percent to $27,828.
   Lindquist said companies are spending more money recruiting at
colleges and universities and noted ``a little bit of craziness''
in which some companies hold college receptions complete with
``caviar, shrimp and exotic pates.''
   But he said companies continue to seek the old standbys: good
grades and extra-curricular activities.

<HEAD>PECO Fined for Improperly Cutting Off Electricity to Customers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Public Utility Commission Thursday
fined Philadelphia Electric Co. $50,000 for improperly cutting off
electricity to customers, including a family who resorted to using
candles that started a fatal fire.
   The PUC said the utility also must contribute $400,000 to an
energy assistance fund for needy families as part of a settlement
regarding customer service violations over a two-year period.
   The most publicized case was last April, when PECO cut off
electricity to a Philadelphia family who used candles to light
their home.
   Eleven days later, a fire started in their row home in the
city's Fairmount section and killed seven-year-old Robert
Blackwell. His five-year-old brother Jason Blackwell received
third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body.
   An PUC investigation determined PECO did not alert a
``responsible adult'' in the family that service would be
terminated but instead told a neighbor.
   The commission said the utility also did not provide a 48-hour
termination notice and would not agree to payment plan offered
twice by the family to clear up the delinquent bill.
   Mitchell Miller, chief of the PUC's consumer research, said the
Blackwells owed $738.01. PECO terminated service and wanted $338 to
reconnect the electricity and asked the family to pay $20 a month
afterwards.
   The Blackwells received state assistance and could not afford
the amount, Miller said. He said PECO would not accept any other
payment arrangements.
   ``They treated this family like they were Mellon Bank,''
Commissioner Joseph Rhodes Jr. said. ``They didn't take into
consideration, as required by law, (the Blackwell's) ability to
pay.''
   After reading the PUC's report, Rhodes said he concluded
``PECO's violations of regulations directly and significantly
contributed to the death of Robert Blackwell and the maiming of
Jason Blackwell.''
   PUC Chairman William Shane said he believes the utility's
violations and sloppy administration contributed to the fatal fire.
He said Philadelphia Electric had been fined $50,000 for similar
violations in 1987. PECO was also forced to pay $150,000 to an
energy assistance fund.
   PECO spokesman Neil McDermott said the fatal fire cannot be
linked to the company's termination of service.
   Shane said it is ``quite disturbing'' that PECO did not modify
its behavior after the 1987 fines.
   ``I think a $400,000 fine has good possibilities for behavior
modification,'' Shane said, noting that the greatest driving force
for change ``is the death.''
   ``Without question, if you look at the report of the Bureau of
Consumer Services in this case, the company has made substantial
progress from where it was two years ago,'' McDermott said.

<HEAD>Rural America Has Low-Income Housing Crisis, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly three of every four rural households
pay more for housing than the government considers affordable, with
about a quarter of all rural residents living in substandard
dwellings, says a new report.
   ``To many Americans, the low-income housing crisis is primarily
an urban problem, calling up visions of homeless men and women
sleeping on steam grates and of families in city welfare hotels,''
said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities.
   ``Yet in rural America, too, there is a crisis in housing for
low-income people,'' Greenstein said.
   His organization and the Housing Assistance Council coauthored
the report released Thursday.
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., said the report demonstrates the
need for his rural housing legislation.
   Sanford has introduced a bill that would increase funding for
Farmers Home Administration rural housing programs by $500 million
over two years, targeting rural communities that traditionally do
not get much help from the federal government.
   ``In my home state of North Carolina, 12 rural counties have
poverty rates over 20 percent and occupied substandard housing
rates over 10 percent,'' said Sanford. ``Some 100,000 North
Carolina households still use outhouses.''
   The report found that 42 percent of rural poor households spent
at least half of their income on housing in 1985, the most recent
year for which data is available. It said 26 percent spent 70
percent or more for housing.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development has standards
that say housing is not considered affordable unless it is 30
percent or less of a family's income.
   While an earlier Department of Agriculture study showed it's
more expensive to live in urban areas, the study released by the
two organizations Thursday says more rural residents live in
substandard housing than city dwellers.
   According to the report, the worst rural housing is in the South.
   The study showed that 83 percent of all rural housing units with
rats were in the South, as were 79 percent of the homes with
inadequate waste disposal, 73 percent with holes in the floor, 61
percent with inadequate heating, 53 percent with cracks in the
walls and 52 percent with inadequate water supplies.
   The study was based on data released in February 1989 by the
Bureau of the Census and HUD in a study called the American Housing
Survey of the United States in 1985.
   The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is an independent
research organization that specializes in issues affecting low- and
moderate-income groups.
   The Housing Assistance Council promotes development of
low-income rural housing through seed-money loans, technical
assistance, research and information.

   A landlord's lawyer plans to appeal the
release of Iris the dog and Whitehill the cat, who had been
impounded in a dispute over back rent.
   Civil Court Judge Thomas Early signed an order this week
releasing the animals, seized Dec. 6 with Lynell Zelenka's car as
security for the money.
   ``The nightmare is over,'' said Zelenka, hugging her 7-year-old
Saluki, and her 11-year-old mixed-breed cat.
   Landlord John Chambers said she owes him $12,000 in rent, which
he agreed to let go unpaid while her lawsuit over a back injury was
pending. He claims she settled the injury suit recently and failed
to tell him.
   But Zelenka, who admits owing Chambers $6,000, ended up with
only $750 after paying attorney fees and medical expenses, Early
was told Tuesday.
   The judge said he has yet to decide how much rent Zelenka owes.
But he ruled Zelenka's pets have value only to her and, unlike a
cow or a horse, would bring no money if put up for sale.
   ``This is a form of hostage, so to speak, to take the dog and
the cat ... Why should the dog and the cat be pulled into the
middle of this thing and deprived of the love of their master?''
Early said.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader-playwright
Vaclav Havel has gained more support for the presidency, with
40,000 supporters cheering him in the streets and the nation's
Roman Catholic primate joining his chorus of backers.
   The opposition and Communist leaders planned to resume
negotiations toward selecting the new president. Communist
hard-liner Gustav Husak resigned Sunday after swearing in the first
government here since 1948 not dominated by Communists.
   Opposition spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky told a news conference
Thursday night that negotiations would resume soon but did not say
when.
   He said negotiators were exhausted after intense discussions
that lasted until late Wednesday and decided to take Thursday night
off.
   About 40,000 people poured into Wenceslas Square in Prague on
Thursday to show their support for Havel. The rally was called by
students who were the vanguard of the pro-democracy movement.
   Police action on Nov. 17 against peaceful student demonstrators
left 143 injured and launched the peaceful revolution that forced
the Communists to relinquish their monopoly on power.
   ``Havel for president!'' and ``We want Havel!'' chanted the
crowd Thursday.
   The voice of Czechoslovak Primate Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek on
Thursday joined others supporting Havel, according to the state
news agency CTK.
   ``My choice for the function of the country's president is Mr.
Vaclav Havel, fighter for the right, justice and truth, not only
for himself, but for all of us,'' wrote the popular, 91-year-old
cardinal in a statement of support carried by CTK.
   The talks Wednesday night at first seemed to have produced
agreement in how a new president would be named.
   Under the constitution, the Federal Assembly has two weeks after
the resignation to elect a new head of state and avoid a
constitutional crisis.
   Opposition leaders thought they reached an understanding with
the Communist Party in earlier negotiations that Havel would be
named president until free elections next year.
   But the 350-member, Communist-dominated parliament has resisted
electing the former dissident, who spent years in jail for fighting
Communist rule and defending human rights.
   In parliamentary sessions Tuesday and Wednesday, the Communist
deputies introduced a proposal to hold a referendum to choose the
new head of state.
   Negotiators met until late Wednesday and concluded by issuing a
joint statement saying the deadline would be extended by a
constitutional amendment to give Parliament 45 days to select the
president.
   Communist Party spokesman Josef Hora said the party would make
its decision on the issue at a special congress set for Dec. 20-21.
   The party's shifts indicated a split in party ranks between
reform-minded members and those associated with the old,
discredited regime of hard-liners.
   Also suggesting divisions within Communist ranks was the
announcement that Slovak party boss Ignac Janak stepped down
Thursday from the Communist Party Politburo and Frantisek Hanus
resigned from the party secretariat.

<HEAD>Pentagon to Halt Round-the-Clock Flights of Airborne Command Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has proposed halting
round-the-clock flights of an airborne command post that since 1961
has had orders to take charge of nuclear forces if the president
and other leaders were killed, The New York Times reported Friday.
   According to Pentagon officials, the Defense Department is
instead proposing that the planes be changed to ``continuous ground
alert with specified number of sorties per week.''
   The Pentagon recommendation, made amid growing defense budgetary
restraints and the belief the threat of a surprise Soviet nuclear
attack is diminishing, needs President Bush's authorization.
   One official told the Times the plan has not drawn strong
objections from within the Defense Department, where some
preliminary defense budget recommendations were reversed after
debate.
   The Air Force maintains on a rotating basis a fleet of planes
collectively known as ``Looking Glass'' that has been under the
command of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Neb. In the event
U.S. leaders were killed during nuclear war, a SAC general would
assume command of nuclear forces.
   The proposal, which originated at SAC, would save about $20
million in fiscal 1990. The plan is one of several recommendations
to change defense planning and spending.

   Younger people with limited educations are more
likely than anyone to light up and should be the target of
campaigns against cigarettes, a study released by the federal
Centers for Disease Control concluded.
   A 1988 survey of about 20,000 people in 36 states and the
District of Columbia found that less-educated people, who also tend
to be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to be
smokers.
   ``There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking. But the
study shows most of the progress is limited to the well-educated,''
said Dr. Luis Escobedo of the Atlanta-based CDC, who analyzed
aspects of the survey released Thursday.
   ``The emphasis must become more targeted,'' he said. ``Some of
that already is being done through substance abuse programs.
Tobacco is an addictive substance.''
   Escobedo said the National Cancer Institute has a program in
inner-city schools working to reduce the odds of children becoming
regular smokers, as do private institutes and some state health
departments.
   The random telephone survey sought people 18 or older.
   Results showed that for people older than 35 the likelihood of
being a current smoker increased with each decrease in the level of
education.
   But for those ages 18 to 34, the chance of being a current
smoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a high
school education, while smoking rates for high school dropouts and
those with high school diplomas were more nearly equal.
   The study said cultural factors, such as the high Mormon
population in Utah, also may affect who smokes. Utah had the lowest
rate of smokers in its over-18 population (18.1 percent) and former
smokers (9.1 percent).
   Kentucky had the highest percentage of current smokers (37.9
percent). The highest percentage of former smokers was in Maine
(20.3 percent).
   The median figure for current smokers was 26.2 percent, meaning
half the states were above that figure and half below. The median
figure for former smokers was 15.1 percent.
   The study said other factors affecting who smokes include
smoking prevention activities such as school programs, state
cigarette taxes and the intensity of promotional events and
advertising by the tobacco industry.
   The study found that 41 percent of the 18-to-34 group with less
than a high school education are smokers. The figure dropped to
about 34 percent for those with a high school education and 19
percent to those with more than a high school education.
   In older age groups the education difference between smokers and
non-smokers was much less pronounced.
   The survey is part of a continuing study done annually since
1980 with more states participating each year.

   The told listeners where the snipers
were hiding, where the bombs were falling. They filled the airwaves
with information, some of it frenetic, some of it wrong, all of it
thrilling.
   ``I'm hit,'' screamed a woman reporter over the air when a shell
landed nearby. She continued to broadcast as her van rushed her to
the hospital, where doctors found she was suffering only from shock.
   Such was the wild, free-wheeling style of radio reporting here
during the eight-day uprising launched by mutinous soldiers on Dec.
1 in an unsuccessful effort to topple President Corazon Aquino.
   Filipinos listened to the rebellion on the radio, absorbed by
round-the-clock running coverage by what is the major medium for
news and information here.
   ``We got threats from all kinds of people almost every day,''
said Nolan Sison, managing editor of DZRH radio. ``We tried to
balance our reporting, and the threats from both sides made us
think we did have a balanced programming.''
   Differences in reporting style showed the slant of individual
stations.
   Reporters and anchormen for DZMM screamed at colleagues from
rival stations for airing ``tactical information,'' such as
positions of government forces and the types of firearms and
vehicles used.
   ``You are traitors to our country,'' a reporter lectured on the
air.
   As tension mounted, the government warned it would strictly
enforce existing guidelines giving it authority to close stations
that broadcast hostile propaganda or ``disinformation.''
   Newspapers are exempt from such controls. Publishers say they
received no directives from the government on what to print.
Individual reporters claim, however, they have been lectured by
military and civilian officials angry at stories perceived as
favorable to the rebels.
   The National Telecommunications Commission closed Manila radio
station DZEC after it erroneously reported that Mrs. Aquino fled
the palace at the height of the coup attempt.
   The station has been the chief outlet of supporters of Ferdinand
Marcos, who died in Hawaiian exile this year after being ousted as
president in February 1986.
   The commission also shut down Cebu radio station DYLA after it
broadcast a taped interview of rebel leader Brig. Gen. Edgardo
Abenina. A week later, the commission reopened the station at the
request of church leaders.
   So far, the government has issued no formal warnings against
other stations. It did not prevent the stations from interviewing
rebels after they gave up strongholds in the Makati financial
district on Dec. 7, despite the ``ban'' on rebel propaganda.
   But stations that adopted a more balanced editorial policy faced
another problem _ fending off threats from both government
officials and the rebels.
   Sison of DZRH said the staff received frequent calls from
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and military officials demanding that
the station omit detailed reports of rebel attacks on military
camps.
   Rebels also demanded that reporters covering the street fighting
broadcast their propaganda.
   Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief of the military-civil relations
office, complained at one point that such detailed reporting was
helping rebel soldiers correct their aim during air and artillery
attacks at the armed forces headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo.
   Stations also received threats from mutineers who demanded that
they transmit only rebel propaganda. One reporter, who spoke on
condition that his name and station not be mentioned, said rebels
threatened him after management refused to broadcast his interview
with them.
   Television stations reacted more cautiously. All but one of the
five Manila stations, including the government station, went off
the air on the first day of the coup attempt.
   Technicians at the four stations removed essential transmitter
parts to keep rebel soldiers from seizing their facilities and
telecasting propaganda.
   In 1987, rebel forces loyal to Marcos took over private
radio-television station GMA-7 and broadcast statements.
   GMA officials said they learned from that experience and decided
to resume operations days later, when it looked like the conflict
was over.
   As the coup attempt unfolded, stations exercised a degree of
self-censorship by bowing to government demands that they avoid
detailed reports of tactical operations.
   Several continued broadcasting reports of shelling at Camp
Aguinaldo and elsewhere, for example, but would not state precisely
where the rounds were falling. Government officers complained the
rebels were monitoring the reports and adjusting their aim
accordingly.
   Stations still reported movements of government forces but
without detailing exactly how many troops were deployed.
   At least 113 people died in the coup, the most serious attempt
yet to topple Mrs. Aquino.

<TEXT>
   From national hero to shunned exile to popular
lawmaker, Andrei D. Sakharov's remarkable journey of conscience
made him perhaps the world's most celebrated dissident.
   His life was a great irony: the physicist who developed the
Soviet hydrogen bomb went on to become his nation's greatest
advocate of human rights at a time when the world lived under the
shadow of nuclear war.
   He spoke out for democracy when many others were silent. He kept
speaking out when it became fashionable under the reforms of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Hours before he died at age 68, he stood on the floor of the
Soviet Congress of People's Deputies and demanded that the
squabbling opposition form an alternative party to the ruling
Communists.
   ``We cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the
leadership is doing now,'' he said, speaking in an official forum
the type of words that sent him into internal exile for six years,
that won him a Nobel Peace Prize.
   Selfless, brave and determined, the stooped, disheveled dean of
Soviet dissent lived to see many of his dreams come true. His own
people began to acknowledge his greatness, as the rest of the world
had done earlier.
   But Sakharov was never satisfied, saluting reforms but faulting
their inadequacy. He constantly challenged even the man who turned
many of his dreams into reality and set him free after nearly seven
years in exile.
   ``I personally respect Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev very much,
but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of
perestroika,'' Sakharov boldly told the Soviet Congress in June
after it added the presidency to Gorbachev's job as Communist Party
general secretary.
   Born the son of a physicist on May 21, 1921, Sakharov's early
fame was not as a political activist but as a brilliant scientist.
He was inducted into the Academy of Sciences in 1953 at age 32, the
hallowed hall's youngest member ever.
   In 1948, he joined physicist Igor Tamm in developing the
hydrogen bomb and for the next 20 years lived and worked in
secrecy, with privileges that included a good apartment, a driver,
a high salary and a government awards.
   But, like Albert Einstein, Sakharov began to worry about the
morality of developing weapons of mass destruction. He had his
first major brush with top Soviet officials in 1961, when he
appealed to Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev to stop nuclear weapons
tests.
   Khrushchev responded that scientists shouldn't meddle in
politics. Two years later, the Soviet Union agreed to such limits
in a treaty with the United States.
   Sakharov, horrified at Soviet society's mistreatment of its own
citizens, once said his ``social and political views underwent a
major evolution.'' He risked his prestigious position and began
using his influence for victims of human rights abuses in 1966,
speaking out for those who suffered under dictator Josef Stalin's
repressions.
   The authorities showed their rage in 1968, when Sakharov's
``Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual Freedom'' was published
abroad. It called for Soviet-American detente well before the
concept became part of Soviet foreign policy, saying progress in
disarmament is impossible without human rights and political
changes in the Soviet Union. He was banned from work on secret
projects.
   Sakharov called the essay ``a turning point in my life'' and two
years later, he helped found the Moscow Human Rights Committee. In
1971, after the death of his first wife, he married Yelena Bonner,
a Leningrad doctor and human rights activist who was to become his
constant, feisty companion.
   In 1975, he won even greater world recognition and was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize.
   The Soviets, on the other hand, condemned his strong criticism
of the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   First they stripped him of his awards and then on Jan. 22, 1980,
he was pickup up on a Moscow street and banished to internal exile
in Gorky, a closed city 200 miles east.
   In an autobiographical statement written in 1981, Sakharov
reflected on his approach to human rights.
   ``Moral criteria, in combination with unrestricted inquiry,
provide the only possible compass for these complex and
contradictory problems. ... Today, as always, I believe in the
power of reason and the human spirit,'' Sakharov wrote.
   Western governments, scientific and human rights groups pressed
the Soviets to release him. In December 1986, a phone was suddenly
installed in Sakharov's Gorky apartment, and Gorbachev called to
say he could return to Moscow.
   Sakharov, suppressing his joy at the news to show his concern
for others, told Gorbachev to free all political prisoners.
   Two months after Sakharov's release, scores of political
prisoners were freed and he threw his support behind Gorbachev. He
gradually was rehabilitated, getting his old job back at the
Academy of Sciences, speaking at official conferences and giving
interviews to the Soviet press.
   In November 1988, he was allowed to travel abroad for the first
time, even though Gorbachev himself had said earlier Sakharov could
not travel to other countries because he had access to state
secrets.
   Although he professed not to aspire to politics, Sakharov was
elected to represent the Academy in the new Congress. Academy
leaders had initially rejected him, but had to reverse the decision
after a popular outcry.
   Sakharov's rumpled figure and high-pitched voice became familiar
to millions of Soviets watching his televised appearances at the
Congress, and fellow parliamentarian Yeltsin called him ``the
nation's conscience.''
   Age and poor health curtailed his human rights activities _ he
looked far older than his years _ but when he felt he had to speak
out, he did, such as his condemnation of the crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in China in June 1989 and constant
complaints that Gorbachev's economic and political reforms did not
go far enough.
   Even though he was a poor speaker _ with a slight stutter and
high-pitched voice _ the public had come to know and like Sakharov
so much that an unscientific poll by a Soviet newspaper in October
1989 indicated he was the most popular parliamentarian, outscoring
even Gorbachev and the maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin.
   In a February 1989 tribute to Sakharov, the weekly magazine
Ogonyok ``praised a person who had earlier been cursed'' and
published his long-suppressed essays and letters.
   The Soviet press had come a long way from the pre-glasnost days
when it branded him a traitor and ``utterly ignorant person'' who
``groveled before the capitalist order.''

<HEAD>Durenberger Made 40 Trips to Earn $100,000</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., made at least
40 expense-paid speaking appearances to earn $100,000 through a
book contract he's accused of using to launder honoraria, records
show.
   His Minneapolis publisher said Thursday the speaking fees
enabled him to show a profit on Durenberger's two books on health
and defense policy and allowed the senator to record the earnings
as salary.
   The Senate Ethics Committee, which has hired a special counsel
to determine whether Durenberger used the book deal to circumvent
Senate honoraria limits, has subpoenaed records from organizations
that paid the fees as well as from publisher Gary L. Diamond.
   Durenberger amended his Senate financial disclosure statements
in recent months to list the 40 expense-paid speaking appearances,
many of them in such locales as Bermuda and Palm Springs, Calif.
   The speaking appearances include an engagement with the American
Podiatric Medical Association in Chicago in 1986 where ``there was
not even a mention of the book or books,'' said John Carson,
director of government affairs for the group.
   Carson said a $2,000 check was sent to Diamond's Piranha Press,
but he considered it ``from day one up to the current moment as a
fee for the purpose of the senator making a speech to our
audience.''
   Durenberger, who says he cleared the book deal through the
Federal Election Commission, contends he broke no Senate rules.
Aides said he would not respond to questions about the deals now
under investigation.
   The book deal is one of three plans Durenberger had for boosting
his income at a time he was having financial and marital
difficulties. Two of the arrangements are being looked at by the
Ethics Committee _ the book matter and allegations that Durenberger
arranged speeches in 1985 and 1986 to coincide with appointments he
and his wife had with a marriage counselor in Boston.
   The committee also could be asked to look at payments the Senate
made to Durenberger for his rental of a Minneapolis condominium in
which he owned an interest.
   Diamond says it was his idea, not Durenberger's, to have
Diamond's Piranha Press division publish the two books _ ``Neither
Madmen Nor Messiahs'' and ``Prescription for Change.''
   But it was the senator's idea to use Piranha Press as a
speaker's bureau to make money for both men from Durenberger's
appearances, Diamond said.
   He sold 13,000 copies of his books, not enough to cover the cost
of printing them, Diamond said. The $200,000 earned from the
senator's speaking appearances enabled the publisher to net a
$50,000 profit, said Diamond.
   ``That was not the intent. At the time we went into it we
thought most of the money would be from the sales, but it just
didn't work out that way. I thought we would sell more than we
did,'' Diamond said in a telephone interview.
   Diamond estimates special interest groups paid Piranha Press
about $200,000 to hear Durenberger speak over the two-year period.
   Durenberger ended the contract because of the criticism he
received, although the FEC concluded that payments from his
publisher would constitute a stipend rather than speaking fees, he
said.
   ``I believe I made a good faith effort to comply with the law by
contacting the FEC and seeking its opinion in advance of any work I
did under the agreement,'' Durenberger said in a statement his
office issued recently.
   The complaint before the Ethics Committee contends Durenberger
misrepresented the deal to the FEC.
   Durenberger lists 23 appearances in 1985 in connection with the
books, including trips to New Orleans, Hilton Head, S.C., and four
cities in Florida. His 17 engagements in 1986 took him to Palm
Springs twice and Bermuda and Monterey, Calif., once each.
   Durenberger filed the amendments to his financial disclosure
statements as a result of discussions between his aides and the
Senate Ethics Committee staff, said his press secretary, Carrie
Collins.
   The Ethics Committee staff has refused to comment on the
investigation, but the senator's office confirmed the panel
subpoenaed records about the speaking engagements.

   President Bush, calling this year's holiday
``the Christmas we've awaited for 50 years,'' is urging Americans
to celebrate by reaching out to someone in need.
   Bush, with an assist from his 3-year-old granddaughter Marshall,
threw a switch to light the National Christmas Tree on Thursday
night, carrying on a tradition that Calvin Coolidge started in 1923.
   He used the ceremony before about 12,000 people opening the
Pageant of Peace on the Ellipse both to celebrate ``the bells of
freedom'' ringing across Europe and to nudge Americans once again
to aid the less fortunate.
   Bush even got into the shopping spirit earlier Thursday, making
a personal expedition to a local Sears store to buy presents _
clothing, not toys _ for his 11 grandchildren. He came prepared
with a list and paid cash.
   Unlike his predecessor Ronald Reagan, who used to light the
National Christmas Tree from the White House, Bush went to the
Ellipse to light the 35-foot living blue spruce, decorated this
winter to symbolize Bush's ``thousand points of light.''
   Describing the dramatic strides toward democracy that have
unfolded in Eastern Europe, Bush declared, ``This is the Christmas
that we've awaited for 50 years.''
   Now, he said, ``1989 is ending bright with the prospect of a far
better Christmas time than Europe has ever known; a far better
future the world dared to imagine.''
   With the Berlin wall tumbling down and ``spring'' returned to
Prague, he said, ``The glad sound you hear is not only the bells of
Christmas, but also the bells of freedom.''
   Turning his thoughts toward home, Bush said:
   ``We've worked hard this year, all of us, all of you, to help
build a better America, to help make this a kinder and gentler
nation.''
   But ``there remains a world of need all around us. In this
holiday season, reach out to someone right where you live,'' he
said.
   ``From now on in America, `there's no room at the inn,' that's
simply not an acceptable answer,'' said the president.
   The National Christmas Tree is a living blue spruce transplanted
to its permanent spot on the Ellipse in 1978.
   The ceremony, which kicked off the 1989 Pageant of Peace on the
Ellipse, took place despite some star-crossed microphones.
   When singer Loretta Lynn tried to belt out ``A Good Old Country
Christmas,'' her cordless microphone flickered on and off. A
stagehand gave her another mike. It was dead.
   Lynn corralled master of ceremonies Willard Scott, dressed in a
Santa Claus suit, and began singing into the mike beneath his beard.
   ``I'm glad I had one beard to give for my country,'' quipped the
jocular weatherman.
   Later, singer Marilyn McCoo found herself without amplification,
and pageant president Joseph H. Riley couldn't be heard introducing
Bush.
   Some speakers cut off in mid-ceremony for the president.
   Before retreating to the White House, Bush leaned over and
intoned into Scott's beard _ site of the only reliable microphone _
``Santa, you did a fine job.''

<HEAD>Founder of Company at Heart of Scandal Denies Bribery Charges</HEAD>

   Hiromasa Ezoe, the head of a company that brought
down a government by plying it with favors, said in court today
that the gifts he gave to politicians were not meant as bribes.
   The 53-year-old Recruit Co. chief told Judge Tadatsugu Watanabe
that he accepted the prosecution's allegations that he provided
gifts and bargain-priced stock to influential figures.
   ``These events did occur, but I do not agree with the substance
of the charges,'' Ezoe said. ``I had absolutely no intention of
committing bribery. ... I apologize for causing social disorder.''
   Also denying bribery charges were Recruit executive Toshiro Ono
and two politicians: former Cabinet Minister Takao Fujinami and
Katsuya Ikeda of the opposition Clean Government party.
   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years in
prison.
   Their trial is the last of five that began Nov. 22 in Tokyo
District Court.
   More than just legal proceedings, the court actions are
examinations of the cozy relationship between Japanese government
and business.
   The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned last spring after
acknowledging he received large donations from the giant
information services conglomerate.
   Other key figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party have
been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking
bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from
Recruit.
   Like the other three defendants, Ezoe accused prosecutors of
mistreating him.
   ``The prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I
tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the
point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said.
   Fujinami, 56, was chief Cabinet secretary under Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor. He is accused of
receiving the equivalent of $140,000 and 10,000 shares in
Recruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential
people at a reduced price before it was sold publicly.
   Prosecutors say he put pressure on the Labor Ministry not to
change the traditional season for recruiting college graduates,
which would have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines.
Fujinami denied the allegations.
   Fujinami said he had been unaware of both the political
donations from Recruit and the share-dealing, which was done by an
aide.
   Ikeda, 52, is charged with receiving $14,000 for himself,
$35,000 for his wife and 5,000 shares in Recruit-Cosmos for his
brother.
   According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches in
Parliament in return. Ikeda resigned his seat; Fujinami remained in
Parliament, but resigned from his party.
   Ono, a 39-year-old former company department head who faces two
counts of giving bribes, denied the allegation.
   The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruit
executives.
   Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe.
Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or
politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the
official is in a position to supervise.
   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to
hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the
stock was available to the general public.
   When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price of
the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. Fujinami's
shares were said to have gained him $215,000.

<HEAD>FDA Examining Possible Problems on Generic Drug for Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is
investigating reports that high doses of a generic drug used to
treat leukemia patients may cause dangerous neurological side
effects.
   The FDA said it is considering how to alert physicians to
reports from the University of Wisconsin that high doses of generic
cytarabine, made by Quad Pharmaceuticals of Indianapolis, may have
more serious neurological side effects than are caused by low doses
of the drug.
   The reports were presented to the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory
Committee on Thursday at an emergency meeting called by the agency
``because of the serious nature of the problem.''
   Stephen Rinsler, an FDA pharmacologist, estimated as many as
3,000 leukemia patients may be candidates for high-dose cytarabine
therapy _ about 30 times the normal dose.
   An official said the concerns were not prompted by Quad's legal
problems with the agency's generic drug division. Earlier this
year, the company and a former executive pleaded guilty to charges
of bribing FDA chemists to win approval of generic drug
applications.
   Cytarabine is known to have neurological side effects, including
loss of muscular coordination and slurred speech. But in high doses
it appears these side effects may be more prevalent and more
severe, said Dr. Gregory Burke, acting director of the FDA's
oncology division.
   ``Nothing is very definitive,'' Burke said. ``It's like a flag
signal.''
   Burke said the action the FDA takes to alert physicians to the
reports will depend on whether Quad decides to take similar action
on its own, although he said some action will be taken within the
week.
   Quad officials did not return a telephone call for comment late
in the day Thursday.
   The FDA investigation could not determine whether any patients
had died as a result of the effects of the Quad drug. Most of the
patients being treated at the University of Wisconsin's medical
center were on a combination of drugs, were in advanced stages of
the disease and could have had other side effects of the
cytarabine, which also suppresses bone marrow and damages the
liver, Burke said.
   Burke said the FDA was alerted to the possible problem by the
University of Wisconsin last summer. The medical center returned to
using Upjohn's brand-name Cytosar after the side effects of the
Quad product were noticed.
   Analyses of samples of the brand name and generic drugs found
they both meet FDA standards, and neither drug appears to cause an
unusually large number of neurological problems when used in normal
doses, Burke said.
   However, Burke said FDA officials are concerned that when used
in high doses, impurities in the Quad drug may worsen the side
effects.
   Impurities resulting from the manufacturing process are
different in the two drugs, he said. At high doses the ``relative
amount of impurities could make a difference,'' Burke said.
   The problem could extend to other drugs when they are used in
high doses because all drugs contain a certain amount of
impurities, he said.
   He noted doctors have found success in high anti-cancer drug
dosages, and because of that, physicians are increasing dosages
above the level for which the drug was approved. In the case of
cytarabine, the high doses were about 30 times the regular dose,
Burke said.
   The FDA's investigation of the Wisconsin high-dose patients
found eight of 25 patients on the Quad drug experienced
neurological side effects, while three of 34 patients on the Upjohn
drug had these effects, Rinsler said.

<HEAD>Poindexter Says Reagan Fighting Subpoenas For Political Reasons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra defendant John Poindexter says
former President Reagan is trying to avoid political criticism in
attempting to quash a subpoena for his diaries.
   Poindexter's lawyers challenged both Reagan and President Bush
to invoke executive privilege in their attempts to quash defense
subpoenas for the former president's diaries and papers.
   Reagan and the Justice Department moved to quash the subpoenas,
but on legal grounds other than executive privilege.
   ``Obviously their legal position is carefully calculated to
avoid subjecting them to the political consequences of their
invoking the privilege, including the consequent public perception
that Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush are still attempting to hide the true
facts regarding their involvement in the so-called Iran-Contra
affair,'' Poindexter's lawyers said in a court filing.
   Poindexter, who is accused of lying to congressional inquiries
about his involvement in the arms-for-hostages deals and covert
assistance to Nicaraguan rebels, underscored his desire to call
Reagan as a witness at the trial.
   ``Documents produced in response to the defendant's subpoena are
no substitute for Mr. Reagan's live testimony. Indeed, that live
testimony may be essential to the jury's understanding of those
documents,'' the defense brief said.
   Poindexter's filing in U.S. District Court was made in response
to motions by Reagan and the Justice Department to quash subpoenas
for documents in the possession of the former president and the
National Archives.
   In its brief, the Justice Department told Judge Harold H. Greene
``the unique and sensitive nature of the documents sought by
defendant mandates extreme prudence in fashioning a procedure
governing their potential disclosure.''
   Poindexter received the judge's permission to subpoena the
documents to try to show that he believed his actions in the
Iran-Contra affair were legal and authorized by Reagan so that he
would have no motive to lie about them.
   ``If Mr. Reagan or Mr. Bush is concerned about the impact of
this case upon the prerogatives of the presidency, then they should
invoke executive privilege,'' Poindexter's lawyers said.
``Otherwise, they are just wasting the court's and the defendant's
time.''

   What was thought to be a raven attacking
kids at the Winona Day Care Center in southeastern Minnesota turned
out to be a crow that seemed to just care a lot about people.
   On Wednesday, a group of preschoolers sang and danced around the
bird, which played tug-of-war with sticks and tried to land on
toddlers' heads.
   ``When a crowd of kids goes out on the playground, he feels he
has to come over and play,'' said teacher Nancy Hoffmaster.
   Hoffmaster and receptionist Debbie Stark said the bird also
liked to pick up pencils and other items, which it dropped on cars.
   But because the crow scared many of the children, it was
captured later Wednesday by security guard Art Kreisher Sr. and
Hoffmaster and put into a cage.
   Kreisher said he plans to free the bird unless it is claimed in
the next couple of days.
   ``I figure he's got a right to live. He really never hurt
anybody,'' Kreisher said.

   Rachel Vital needed help getting up from
her chair to take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. Once
she did, the 90-year-old woman stood proudly and became a U.S.
citizen.
   ``It's always been her dream to become a citizen,'' Victor Vital
said as he watched his mother take the oath Wednesday in the
courtroom of U.S. District Judge Robert Renner.
   After the ceremony, Mrs. Vital, a native of Salonica, Greece,
smiled and joined the applause for herself and 48 others from
Europe, Asia and Africa who became citizens.
   Victor Vital said his mother tried to become a citizen when he
did back in 1973, about six years after she came to this country,
but she couldn't pass the test because of a language problem.
   ``She can speak Greek, Italian, Spanish and French, but not
English. But after 20 years, even if you don't speak English, you
can become a citizen as long as you know the main laws,'' he said.
``My mother always had the dream to become a citizen because her
children are. We love Greece, but this is our home.''

   Children who are frightened by the big,
bad image of gun-toting TV cops may find it easier to deal with
state police carrying the latest weapon in their arsenal _ a
uniformed teddy bear.
   Indiana hopes to have the 10-inch stuffed bears in its cars by
January, and several other states have similar programs.
   ``Trooper Teddy'' began riding shotgun in all Kentucky State
Police cars this month.
   Troopers carry the bears to give to children who are victims of
auto accidents, sexual abuse or other traumatic crimes.
   ``Many children aren't used to seeing the uniform, the badge,
the gun,'' said Capt. John Lile, commander of public affairs for
the Kentucky State Police. ``We're trying not to be so
intimidating.''
   The Indiana State Police Alliance is working to raise at least
$3,000 to buy 500 bears to carry in police cars.
   ``It's like falling off a log to raise money for sick and dying
children,'' said Ernie Alder, director of youth services for the
Indiana State Police. ``No one can say no.''

   The man charged with killing 27 people in
what police call the nation's worst alcohol-related traffic
accident publicly apologized for an act he claims to be unable to
recall.
   Testifying Thursday in front of a chart with the victims'
photographs and names, Larry Mahoney said he had no recollection of
driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, and
colliding with the packed church bus.
   ``It's a fact I was involved in an accident, but I don't
remember seeing the bus,'' Mahoney said. ``I remember waking up in
the hospital.''
   He concluded his 70 minutes on the witness stand by apologizing
to the survivors and families of those maimed or killed in the
disaster.
   ``I really am sorry and I mean this,'' Mahoney said, his voice
tight with emotion. ``I know it's not going to make you feel any
different toward me.''
   Members of the victims' families, and Mahoney's family, broke
into tears.
   Behind Mahoney was a large seating chart of the church bus that
carried 67 passengers, the names of those killed designated with a
black letter ``D.''
   Mahoney faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the
charges: 27 counts of murder, 42 counts of wanton endangerment, 12
counts of assault and a count of drunken driving.
   Defense attorney Russell Baldani said Mahoney was relieved after
taking the stand.
   ``He didn't have to tell me. ... It was readily apparent,''
Baldani said.
   The trial recessed until Monday, when both defense and
prosecution will call rebuttal witnesses.
   Mahoney, a factory worker, said he was upset the day of the
crash over a variety of personal problems: his attempts to
reconcile with his estranged wife, Janice; his declaration of
bankruptcy because of large medical bills for a daughter's health
problems; and attempts, thwarted by bad credit, to buy a new
trailer for his family.
   Mahoney said the problems were not an excuse for his drinking
and driving.
   Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky Jr., said of Mahoney's testimony:
   ``When you compare bankruptcy, and how do I get a double-wide
trailer ... to the fact that you no longer have a son or a
daughter, or the survivors who will wear the badges of his mistake
for the rest of their lives, it sort of pales in significance.''
   Mahoney described stopping for beer at two bars and a liquor
store on the Saturday afternoon of the crash and drinking with
friends and while driving to see an ex-girlfriend, his parents and
a friend.
   He described asking for a beer at a small party after giving a
friend the keys to his truck. No beer was available, and a man
offered him a mixed drink. A clear liquid Mahoney couldn't identify
was poured into a glass.
   ``I took a big drink of it and I coughed and choked on it,'' he
said.
   Some of the men laughed at his reaction, he recalled, adding
that he drank a soft drink to get rid of the taste.
   In previous testimony, witnesses said the soft drink was mixed
with vodka, but Mahoney said he couldn't taste anything in it.
   Nor did he remember getting the keys to his truck and driving
away, he said.
   Richwalsky said he had problems with Mahoney's ``selective
memory.''
   William Summers, Mahoney's lead attorney, said he will attempt
to introduce evidence about Ford Motor Co. next week. Ford
manufactured the chassis of the 1977 school bus involved in the
wreck.
   The defense contends that the design of the bus, built before
federal safety standards were tightened, contributed to the deaths.

<HEAD>Observers Describe Violence at Nicaraguan Election Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House says a bipartisan panel's
report on bloody violence at a rally in Nicaragua raises the Bush
administration's concerns that the Sandinistas don't intend to hold
a fair election.
   Members of the panel on Thursday gave President Bush a firsthand
account of the bloodletting last weekend that they said was caused
by Sandinista supporters wielding machetes.
   Democratic and Republican members of the delegation met with
Bush for 30 minutes, displaying photographs and videotapes of
people whose arms had been severed. At least one person was killed
in the violence, officials have said.
   ``Our point was that unless something is changed dramatically
now ... people will be afraid to vote'' in the Feb. 25 election,
said delegation member Bob Beckel, a political consultant who was
Walter Mondale's 1984 presidential campaign manager.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the group's
report ``only heightens'' concerns that the Sandinistas won't hold
a fair election as scheduled in February.
   Fitzwater said the White House gave additional credence to the
group's report because Beckel opposes aid to the U.S.-backed
Contras. Beckel told reporters although he was disturbed by the
events, he remained opposed to Contra aid.
   The group said Bush agreed to help arrange a meeting with the
Contras in an effort to get a pledge that the rebels won't
instigate violence during the election.
   Members of the group said supporters of the leftist government
violently disrupted a Sunday rally held by backers of opposition
presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro in the town of Masatepe and
that a Sandinista police chief refused entreaties to stop the
fracas.
   Cecilia Lopez, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Washington, called the Masatepe violence ``an isolated incident''
and said the opposition has held more than 50 peaceful rallies
since campaigning began.
   Ambassador Luigi R. Einaudi, the U.S. representative to the
Organization of American States, said Thursday that there had seven
incidents of violence or intimidation since Nov. 1, when the
Sandinistas lifted their unilaterally declared cease-fire against
the Contra rebels.
   ``Despite many fine words about good intentions, the reality of
the violence is ... preventing the elections from channelling the
conflict into the political foms that could give Nicaraguans hope
for a more peaceful future,'' Einaudi said in a speech to a regular
session of the OAS Permanent Council.
   Members of the American group said OAS observers missed most of
the violence and later deliberately downplayed the Sandinista
involvement by saying it was impossible to say who started the
violence or who played a major role.
   The delegation said in its report that observers arrived to find
a rock-throwing battle involving about 100 people. The American
delegation and two OAS observers ``moved through the crowd, urging
calm.''
   One of the OAS observers told the Americans the fracas began
when opposition supporters were set upon by a small group of
Sandinista backers who taunted them and threw rocks.
   After the nearby political rally concluded, several bands of
Sandinista youths charged into the crowd with rocks, nail-studded
sticks and machetes, the report said.
   The observers said they tried to help break up the fracas and
later sought out the police chief to intervene. The police chief
said he didn't want to intervene because he feared he would be
accused of interrupting an opposition rally, but finally agreed to
accompany them to the site of the fracas, the report said.
   The trip by the 15-member American delegation was sponsored by
the non-profit Center for Democracy, which has sent election
observers to Panama, El Salvador and the Philippines. Nicaragua
invited the center to send a team to monitor election preparations.

   Some kiddies who write to Father Christmas get
right to the point, saying what they want _ ``a doll and a best
friend,'' ``to get my cast off.'' Others ask only for the clothes
their parents can't afford.
   Some are concerned that Santa be able to find their house _ and
get in once he arrives.
   Every single one claims to have been good.
   ``Santa, this year I don't want toys,'' wrote Michelle. ``I need
a coat for me and my brother ... my mother is good but she can't
buy me a new coat, but I know you can.''
   Donna, the mother of ``two beautiful little girls whose father
has deserted them,'' asked Santa to explain why her children
wouldn't get presents this Christmas.
   Coping with a full-time job and attending college, she wrote
that some paydays she can't even afford food.
   ``What I would like is for Santa to write my girls and explain
why Christmas is not just a time for presents but also a time for
sharing and being with your family. It is so hard for children to
understand why Santa skips our house.''
   By Christmas, the Postal Service estimates, 250,000 children
will have sent letters to the North Pole.
   Every year, many requests are opened at local post offices and
passed on to his helpers _ social service agencies, charities,
community groups and people with deep pockets.
   This Christmas, many of the letters are being opened by his
elves in Atlanta, where the Coca-Cola Co. and its employees have
contributed money and manpower to screen Santa's mail and to be
sure he knows where he is most needed.
   The company is donating 5 cents for each letter received, up to
2 million letters, to The Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots
Program.
   What are the elves reading? Letters like these.
   Andy, 4, asked for a shaving kit, ``so I could shave my face
with daddy,'' and for ``a pretend blender.''
   A note with no name _ but Santa knows anyway, doesn't he? _
asked how he and the reindeer were doing and then told him, just so
he'd know, that ``somebody here was a little bad this year, but it
could not be me.'' The child with no name asked for a computer and
cross-country skis, among other things.
   Likewise, Caitlin wrote: ``I have been a good girl. My brother
has not.''
   Desiree asked for ``a doll and a best friend.'' Katie said: ``I
just want to get my cast on my arm off. I also don't want my sister
to get married.''
   Shayla wanted to be sure Santa had directions to her house.
   ``You come down a dead end street. You will see a store. Next to
the store you will see a blue house. ... Ring the door bell because
the door is locked.''
   Andrea, who wants a doll house and race cars, asked Santa ``how
you and your elves get all the presents delivered in one night.''
The Postal Service would probably like to know that too.
   Augustin, who has muscular dystrophy and can't walk, told Santa
he'd like a remote-control race car, but added: ``I am happy to
receive anything you send me. I'm a teen-age boy who has been
raised by my single mom who has taught me to be grateful.''
   Seven-year-old Edwin, confined to a wheelchair and with ``health
problems that keep me most of the time in the hospital,'' asked for
clothes and a musical toy. He also put in a plug for his sister,
who takes care of him like a ``second mommy,'' and for his two
brothers _ ``my best friends.''
   Jennifer, 2 years and 3 months old, wrote with an adult's help
to ask for a pair of pants, shoes, ``a jacket with a hat and a
teddy bear.''
   She told Santa that she doesn't have a father and that her
mother is 16. ``I would like a gift from you because you are going
to be my father,'' she added.
   Among the requests _ for doll houses and race cars, for a best
friend and a sister who won't marry, for shoes and a warm coat _
was a postcard in an adult hand from a ritzy hotel in San Francisco.
   Marie wrote:
   ``Thank you so very much for all you do for all the people in
the world. I'm very content in life. I don't want to ask for
anything. I'd just like to encourage you to keep up the good work!''
   She drew a heart next to her name.

<HEAD>American Airline In-Flight News to Lack Air Crash Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airline flights will feature taped CNN
newscasts without pictures of plane crashes, after CBS balked at
the airline's request that it cut such stories from its in-flight
programs.
   American did not renew its six-year contract with the ``CBS
Morning News'' and the last program will be shown on the airline
before Feb. 28, said David Berman, a vice president at CBS
Broadcast International.
   Under American's guidelines, he said, CBS has pulled entire news
programs with reports of airline crashes or ``virtually anything
detrimental to the airlines.''
   But CBS refused American's request to delete adverse airline
news ``and deliver the remainder of the show,'' he said.
   American's rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers, but
``it's like passing out newspapers with holes cut in them,'' Berman
said Thursday.
   American's decision to drop CBS was financial and wasn't based
on an editorial dispute, said Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the
airline, ``We didn't feel we were earning enough profit from our
agreement with CBS,'' she said.
   But she said the new CNN arrangement, in which video portraying
airline crashes will be deleted, was worked out after American's
surveys showed that its passengers complained that pictures of
airline crash scenes disturbed them.
   American's new in-flight agreement for Cable News Network
newscasts is with Turner Home Entertainment, a division of Ted
Turner's Atlanta-based cable empire that merchandises CNN programs
and other ventures.
   CNN said it hopes to have news programs aboard 144,000 American
flights annually by the end of 1990. Its newscasts will begin in
March with eight domestic flights. He declined to disclose the
value of the contract.
   Steve Chamberlain, a vice president of Turner's merchandising
division, said the American-CNN contract is expected to be signed
next week, and editorially ``is limited to (stories about) air
crashes.''
   ``There will not be any other wholesale editing of our
product,'' he said. ``Above all, we have to preserve the
journalistic integrity of our network.''
   Chamberlain called the agreement ``a common-sense approach to
crashes aboard those jets.''
   ``It is unreasonable to expect airline passengers to sit and
watch a graphic portrayal of an airline tragedy,'' he said.
   But Ed Turner, a senior vice president at CNN, said, ``As a
passenger, it would probably make me feel better, but as a
journalist, it doesn't.''
   Chamberlain said none of the other 10 airlines using CNN have
asked for edited versions of the news, which is recorded from live
feeds.
   O'Neill, in a telephone interview from American headquarters in
Dallas, said the agreement wouldn't mean a complete blackout of
such stories.
   ``What the contract with CNN calls for is that CNN will not show
the video,'' she said. ``They will talk, in the audio portion,
about these kinds of incidents. But they will not show the video.''
   Barry Sherman, chairman of the telecommunications department at
the University of Georgia, said the agreement could hurt CNN's
reputation as being free from taint and bias.
   ``What CNN has built its reputation on has been that it has not
avoided the hard issues. They've never, to my knowledge, edited
news content,'' Sherman said.

<TEXT>
   Conductor Michael Tilson Thomas led the New
World Symphony Orchestra, one of America's newest orchestras, in an
enlightening debut at the nation's most venerable concert showcase:
Carnegie Hall.
   This unique ensemble of young professionals was formed only two
years ago, at a time when orchestras everywhere faced money
problems.
   It bills itself as the only full-time, full-size training
orchestra in the country. Its players are recent college graduates,
ranging from ages 21 to 30. The musicians sign on for no more than
three years. The ensemble's alumni already number more than 30.
   In short, the Miami-based New World Symphony Orchestra is an
orchestra in perpetual transition.
   But that didn't mar Thursday night's performance, whose diverse
program ranged from a Beethoven symphony to ``Bamboula Beach _ The
Miami Bamboula'' by Charles Wuorinen.
   Aside from a botched horn entrance here or a flat flute solo
there, the 80 musicians played with great discipline. The biggest
gaffe of the night was minor _ Tilson Thomas' premature entrance
after intermission, before the orchestra tuned up.
   The still youthful Tilson Thomas, who at age 44 is the New
World's artistic director and principal conductor of the London
Symphony Orchestra, held the playing firmly together.
   The concert got off to a jolt with the raucous ``Bamboula
Beach,'' a composition commissioned by the Tilson Thomas for the
ensemble's inaugural performance in February 1988.
   ``The word `bamboula' _ originally a Creole dance _ refers to a
series of otherwise musically unrelated works of mine which all
share a certain lightness of spirit,'' the Pulitzer prize-winning
Wuorinen explained in the program notes.
   It was the first New York performance for the short, energetic
piece, whose dissonance is punctuated by the percussion section. It
even included a solo for the steel drum.
   The composition sometimes sounded like a ride on a subway train,
but it was a fun trip, ending in a smash not a crash.
   Next was Aaron Coplaonstrating tremendous discipline after the
heart-pounding finale of ``Bamboula.''
   The composition's many solos provided a chance to the musicians,
especially the strings and woodwinds, to display their skills. For
the most part, they seized the opportunity.
   Tilson Thomas also chose an unfamiliar version: the complete
symphonic score rather than the often-played suite from the 1944
ballet.
   Some audience members grumbled that they could see why the extra
10 minutes were cut. For others, however, the additional material
took the listener into new recesses of the composition, especially
after the Shaker variations.
   In a bow to traditionalists, the program ended with Beethoven's
``Symphony No. 7 in A Major.''
   The rhythmic, generally whimsical composition provided the
exuberant Tilson Thomas with a podium showpiece. He conducted it
without a score, jabbing his baton toward the players and giving an
occasional leap and foot stomp without distracting the listener.
   After a standing ovation, he returned with members of the
orchestra who did not have parts in the Beethoven for an encore,
Wagner's prelude to Act 3 from ``Lohengrin.''
   ``I wouldn't want to end the night without everyone on stage,''
he told the audience.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at
another record high on Friday despite a morning setback, while the
dollar rose against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.30 yen, up 0.23 yen from Thursday's
close of 144.07 yen. After opening at 144.30 yen, the dollar ranged
betwen 144.25 and 144.38 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 90.34
points for a record closing of 38,271.04. The index's previous
record closing was the 38,180.70 points set Thursday.
   Trading was inactive because of the expected release later
Friday of monthly U.S. economic figures, including trade data for
October and producer prices and industrial production data for
November, dealers said.
   The Nikkei slipped shortly after trading began as market
players, who were already worried about the speed of recent rises
in the index, stepped to the sidelines. But it recovered later
after intermittent index-buying by foreign securities firms, the
dealer said.
   Index-buying is a tactic that involves the purchase of at least
1,000 shares in all 225 Nikkei issues.
   In currency dealings, currency rates moved narrowly in inactive
trading, in which market players awaited the U.S. economic data,
said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   ``The dollar-yen rate moved very tightly, while market players
were just making position adjustments on the West German mark,'' he
said.
   Kanai added that investors in general become reluctant to make
major moves toward the end of the year to avoid possible risks
during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

<HEAD>Text of Sakharov's Final Public Statement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a text of Andrei D. Sakharov's final
public statement, a call to create a formal opposition to the
Soviet Communist Party. It was made hours before his death Thursday
to opposition members in the Congress of People's Deputies. It was
translated from Russian by The Associated Press:
   
   I support the formula of opposition. What is opposition? First,
we cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the leadership
is doing now. It is leading the country to catastrophe, prolonging
the process of perestroika many years. It will leave the country in
a condition in which everything progressive will be destroyed
during these years. All the plans for transition to a market and
perestroika-type economy appear to be unrealistic. Dissatisfaction
is growing in the country, and this dissatisfaction makes the
revolutionary path of development impossible.
   The only possible path of revolutionary development is the
radicalization of perestroika. At the same time we declare
ourselves an opposition, and take the responsibility for the
solutions we suggest. This is another side of the same term
(opposition), which is extremely important as well.
   At this moment, we live in conditions of a deep crisis of trust
in the party and the leadership. This can be eliminated only by
resolute political measures. The exclusion of Article 6 of the
constitution and of the articles in line with Article 6 is a
political move, not purely juridicial or organizational. This is a
most significant political act right now in this country, and not
in a year when work over the new text of the constitution will be
completed. Then all this will no longer be in doubt. We need to
accelerate the process of perestroika now.
   The last thing we need is to make certain the position of our
Inter-Regional Group. The population of the country puts great hope
in the group. But we began losing the trust of the people.
   The last matter I wanted to speak about is whether the political
strike was a present for right-wing forces, and whether an
opposition group will be one as well. I categorically disagree with
both statements. What happened in the past week is the most
powerful politicalization of the country. Discussions embrace the
entire country. It is not important whether there were a lot of
strikes or not. They were quite numerous, including strikes in the
Don Basin, Vorkuta, Lvov and many other places. But this fact is
not of principal importance. It is important that the people at
last have found a means to express their will and readiness to
support us politically. And we cannot lose this support. The only
possible response from us is our political position. They do not
need anything else.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says He'll Work to Keep Brandley Behind Bars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONROE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A district attorney said he will do
everything he can to keep Clarence Brandley behind bars, despite a
decision overturning the death row inmate's conviction for the
rape-slaying of a teen-ager.
   Montgomery County District Attorney Peter Speers said Thursday
he still believes Brandley killed Cheryl Dee Fergeson nine years
ago and that he will ask the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to
change its decision.
   ``I believe the opinion is wrong,'' Speers said. ``If this
opinion stands, the door will be wide open for convicts to
manipulate weak-willed witnesses, invent witnesses and pervert the
entire criminal justice system.
   Brandley's first trial ended with a hung jury. An all-white jury
from the second trial convicted Brandley of raping and strangling
the 16-year-old girl while she was attending a volleyball
tournament in 1980 at Conroe High School, where Brandley worked as
a janitor.
   The appeals court ruled Wednesday that Brandley, who has been on
death row for nearly nine years and has had two execution dates,
was the victim of an unfair trial.
   Brandley's attorneys and supporters claim the investigation and
prosecution was racially motivated since Brandley is black and Miss
Fergeson was white.
   His attorneys also say they're confident of acquittal in a third
trial, but doubt there is sufficient evidence to prompt another
trial.
   Brandley, 38, has said he would welcome a new trial.
   Speers said he would exhaust all legal avenues, including a
third trial, to keep Brandley behind bars.
   ``If this result stands, it is possible, even likely, that he
will have literally gotten away with murder,'' Speers said. ``I
believe this would be a gross miscarriage of justice.''
   James Keeshan, the original prosecutor on Brandley's case and
now a district judge in Conroe, agreed.
   ``I remain convinced, based on the evidence I saw, that Clarence
Brandley murdered Cheryl Fergeson,'' Keeshan said. ``I am concerned
about what effect this decision will have on future cases where
orchestrated events years after the trial may result in the
overturning of convictions.''
   In the 86-page opinion, the appeals court said the investigative
team failed to follow up leads from witnesses, failed to take blood
and hair samples from other janitors who had been Brandley's chief
accusers, provided an opportunity for a common account of the
incident from the janitors, threatened witnesses and lost evidence
from the trial.
   Three white janitors testified in the first trial that they had
seen Brandley follow Miss Fergeson to a restroom. But when one of
the men recanted his testimony, he was not called to testify in the
second trial.
   Speers said he probably will not file a motion with the appeals
court until next week. If the court rejects his request to reverse
its decision, he said he would consider an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   Brandley's attorneys are seeking a personal recognizance bond
for him. The appeals court rejected bond Wednesday.

<HEAD>Judge Calls White House Crack Effort `Keystone Kops Thing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the trial of a teen-ager accused
of selling federal officials crack cocaine across the street from
the White House called the government effort to show how easy it is
to buy drugs was a ``Keystone Kops thing.''
   First the alleged drug dealer didn't show up to make the sale in
Lafayette Park, Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Sam
Gaye testified Thursday. Next the undercover officer's body
microphone malfunctioned. Then the cameraman videotaping the deal
missed the action because he was being assaulted by a homeless
woman.
   ``This is like a Keystone Kops thing,'' U.S. District Judge
Stanley Sporkin exclaimed as the government presented evidence
against alleged drug seller Keith Jackson, 18, whose trial
continues today.
   DEA officials set up the Sept. 1 drug sale to show how easy it
is to buy illegal drugs, even in the shadow of the White House.
President Bush used the story of the sale as an illustration during
his Sept. 5 nationwide speech about the war on drugs.
   Jackson is charged with four counts of distributing crack at
three locations in the nation's capital between April 24 and Sept.
1. If convicted, he faces life in prison without parole.
   Gaye said his boss asked him Aug. 31 to set up a drug deal near
the executive mansion.
   ``He just walked into my office and said, `Can you make a drug
buy around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?''' Gaye testified, adding, ``I
had 24 hours to buy three ounces of crack.''
   Presidential speech writers conceived the idea of having Bush
hold up a bag of crack during his anti-drug speech last summer
while the president was on vacation in Kennebunkport, Maine. Bush
endorsed the idea, and White House officials called a top aide to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who in turn contacted the DEA.
   Gaye said the first dealer he set up a meeting with didn't show.
Then, a meeting was arranged with Jackson.
   The DEA officials said that their efforts to get Jackson to the
park almost failed because Jackson didn't know where the White
House was.
   Gaye also Jackson, who was supposed to hand the three-ounce bag
of crack to Gaye, instead gave it to the informer to hand to the
agent.

   Jennifer Casolo received a hero's
welcome and proclaimed she was innocent of hiding munitions in her
yard in El Salvador as she greeted 350 residents who turned out in
freezing cold to cheer her return.
   Casolo, who said she maintained neutrality while giving visiting
Americans tours of El Salvador during four years there, said
Thursday night she will speak out against U.S. aid to the
Salvadoran government now that she has been expelled.
   Casolo arrived in Miami on Wednesday, then flew Thursday to New
York, where she fielded questions from reporters at LaGuardia
Airport before being driven the 75 miles to Thomaston in a Cadillac
with Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who had lobbied for her
release from a Salvadoran prison.
   Casolo embraced her father, John Casolo, and met close friends
and relatives, including her brother, John, who were waiting for
her in the Town Hall of the town of 7,000 people.
   ``I want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of
my heart for all the prayers and letters,'' John Casolo told the
crowd outside. ``You've really made this the merriest Christmas
we've ever had.''
   Jennifer Casolo, standing on a flatbed truck draped in red,
white and blue bunting, wished the crowd ``Feliz Navidad'' and _
when a sound system failure forced her to use a big megaphone _
joked about her days as a cheerleader at Thomaston High School.
   She left El Salvador Wednesday after a judge dropped terrorism
charges against her for lack of evidence and ordered her deported.
   Casolo, who worked in El Salvador for the Christian Educational
Seminars since 1985, was arrested Nov. 26 after authorities raided
her rented house and unearthed dynamite, grenades and more than
20,000 rounds of ammunition from the garden.
   She said her tribulations were minor compared to those of the
Salvadoran people, 70,000 of whom have died in a decadelong civil
war. But the disrespect with which U.S. authorities dealt with her
case demonstrated their cynicism toward El Salvador's people, she
said
   ``It's shameful. It's disgraceful,'' she said in New York. ``How
can the Bush administration say they're working to create a just
society in El Salvador when they can't even treat an American
citizen with the rights of a just society?
   ``I tried to convey to the Salvadoran police that a person is
innocent until provent guilty but I didn't know that American
officials weren't giving me that right.''
   Bush administration officials did not press for her release and
had said they thought she was probably guilty.
   Casolo said she had a great love for the Salvadoran people and
would not ``feel free'' until all political prisoners were released
there.
   The Salvadorans ``deserve a country where they can eat, where
their children can go to school, where they don't have to worry
about being dragged away in the middle of the night,'' Casolo said.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said he was convinced of
her guilt, despite her release. Asked about that Thursday night,
Casolo said simply, ``I'm innocent.''
   She went on: ``Maybe those weapons were there. Maybe a
Salvadoran guerrilla tipped them off ... but there's just as much
possibility that they beat the hell out of someone to get them to
say it _ and excuse my language.''
   Of the weapons cache, she said, ``I don't know if it was there,
if they put it there or if someone else put it there and I don't
think I'll ever know.''
   Casolo urged an end to U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
   ``For four years I worked in El Salvador. ... During that time I
kept my mouth shut,'' she said. ``It's time for me to talk, so that
others better understand what has happened.''
   After the official homecoming at Town Hall, Casolo headed for a
private reunion with her mother, Audrey Casolo, who did not attend
the welcome ceremony because she wanted to greet her daughter
privately.

   The imprisonment of a former black civil
rights activist resulted from racial polarization in the state,
Gary Tyler's lawyer said after a racially split vote by a pardon
board to reduce his sentence.
   The board voted 3-2 Thursday to recommend that Gov. Buddy Roemer
reduce the life sentence for Tyler, who at 16 was condemned to die
for the 1974 slaying of a white student during a racial
confrontation.
   The death sentence was automatically changed to life when the
U.S. Supreme Court overturned Louisiana's old death penalty law in
1976.
   Tyler's conviction has withstood all appeals, but the vote would
make him eligible for parole in five years. Roemer will make a
decision within a few weeks, his aides said.
   Parole eligibility isn't the same as freedom for Tyler, 31,
whose entire adult life has been spent in the state prison at
Angola, said attorney Mary Howell.
   ``If Gary was white we wouldn't be here today,'' she told
reporters after the pardon board meeting. ``We still don't see the
kind of justice we want in this state.''
   The vote _ three black members for reduction in sentence and two
whites against _ is representative of ``racial polarization,'' said
Howell.
   ``It's pretty amazing,'' she said. ``In 1985 in Ascension Parish
a white kid shot to death an unarmed black kid at a school and was
indicted for manslaughter. He was placed on probation and told to
finish his education and pay the funeral costs of the victim.
   ``And, then we have Gary Tyler, a black kid who police said had
a `smart mouth.'''
   Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have
urged freedom for Tyler, as have more than 12,000 people who signed
petitions to the pardon board. The British reggae band UB40
recorded a song about Tyler and he was described by the Soviet
Communist Party newspaper Pravda in 1978 as a political prisoner.
   Tyler's mother, Juanita Tyler, said she was happy with the
decision, but believes board members would have voted for an
immediate release had they interviewed him. Board members routinely
do not interview inmates unless they are facing death.
   Tyler was active in a school desegregation battle in October
1974 that drew the Ku Klux Klan and state police to Destrehan, a
small town on the Mississippi River 25 miles north of New Orleans.
   One day, whites surrounded buses of black students at Destrehan
High School, shouting and hurling bottles, cans and rocks. A shot
was fired from one of the buses. Timothy Weber, a white student
standing with his mother across the schoolyard, fell dead.
   Witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand. Tyler was
the only one on the bus wearing gloves, said police.
   Those who believe Tyler was framed say that a student who
testified against him was known as a liar and that police planted a
pistol found in the stuffing of the torn seat where Tyler had sat.

   Opposition leader Patricio Aylwin told
his jubilant supporters today that Chileans have regained their
freedom by electing him president, ending the dark era of military
rule under Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   Chileans danced, waved national flags and set off fireworks to
celebrate Aylwin's landslide victory Thursday over Hernan Buchi, a
pro-government candidate. Celebrations lasted into the morning in
Santiago and cities nationwide.
   The election was intended to bring back democracy to the last
South American country still ruled by the military.
   Pinochet was forced to call the election after losing a
referendum in October last year, in which voters rejected a
military proposal that he remain as president until 1997.
   Speaking to hundreds of supporters early today from the
third-floor balcony of a downtown hotel, Aylwin referred to the
generations of democracy enjoyed by Chileans until Pinochet
overthrew elected President Salvador Allende in a bloody 1973 coup.
   ``Chile has refound her history. Chile has regained liberty.
Chile has regained democracy,'' said Aylwin, who promised a
government of national unity to repair the political and social
divisions under the Pinochet regime.
   Pinochet's government officially recognized Aylwin's triumph.
Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said in a nationally broadcast
address that authorities would abide by it.
   Official results from 93 percent of all polling stations in
Thursday's election gave Aylwin 3,577,669 votes or 55.2 percent of
all valid ballots. He was supported by a coalition of 17 parties
ranging from right to left.
   Buchi, Pinochet's former finance minister and architect of a
free market economy, had 1,901,668 votes or 29.4 percent. A third
candidate, populist businessman Francisco Errazuriz, had 998,786
votes, 15 percent.
   Buchi and Errazuriz visited Aylwin to congratulate him on his
victory.
   His absolute majority and 2-1 advantage over his nearest
pro-government challenger appeared to give him the mandate for a
possible upper hand in future relations with Pinochet, who has
vowed to remain on as army commander.
   Aylwin, 71, a Christian Democrat and former Senate president, is
to begin a four-year term on March 11, when Pinochet's term ends.
   Much of his future authority was expected to depend, however, on
results from Thursday's voting for the 38 elected Senate seats and
120 House of Deputies seats. Up to 10 more senators are to be
designated by the Supreme Court, National Security Council and
other government bodies.
   Conclusive returns in the congressional races were not expected
until later today. However, there were indications from
preliminary, unofficial returns that the pro-government forces may
have fared better in the congressional vote than in the
presidential race.
   From the moment Aylwin's victory became evident, supporters took
to the streets, dancing and chanting or roaming in noisy caravans
of buses, trucks and automobiles. They waved Chilean flags and
party banners, blowing on horns and shooting off fireworks.
   Similar celebrations were reported in other large cities, and in
the Pacific resort city of Vina del Mar, national police used water
cannons to clear the streets.
   Demonstrations are legally banned on election day. Police in
Santiago, who had blocked many anti-Pinochet protests and fired
water cannons and tear gas at demonstrators in the past, did not
intefere with the celebrations and even suspended traffic on the
city's main boulevard to allow Aylwin supporters to listen to their
leader's victory speech.
   ``It's forbidden,'' said a police lieutenant at the scene, ``but
there's no problem.''
   Ending his speech, Aylwin urged the demonstrators to return
peacefully and to attend a celebration rally tonight.
   Pinochet, in a bref conversation with reporters, said he was not
disturbed by Aylwin's victory. ``They were better organized. They
know how to do things,'' he said.
   The election was peaceful, with voters arriving early at the
polls and waiting patiently in long lines, sometimes for hours, to
cast their ballots. Nearly all 7.5 million elegible voters cast
their votes.
   Caceres said Chileans should take pride on the peaceful manner
the election took place and for the high turnout, and praised the
armed forces for maintaining order.
   Aylwin lauded the ``maturity'' of the population, and also said
the armed forces deserved praise for carrying out a clean election.
   Chile becomes the eighth South American nation in a decade to
return to civilian rule. Others include Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,
Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. In February, Paraguayan Andres
Rodriguez ended more than three decades of rule by Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner, overthrowing him and declaring a presidential election,
which Rodriguez won.

   Researchers say physicians fail to
diagnose severe depression in half the patients who suffer the most
common mental illness, and the problem is worse in prepaid health
plans.
   ``Depression is quite serious, it's eminently treatable, and yet
we're finding only half of patients are detected'' by doctors who
are paid fees based on how much care they provide patients, said
Dr. Kenneth Wells, the study's chief author.
   Only two-fifths of depressed patients were recognized by general
practitioners, internists and other non-mental health specialists
who were paid fixed fees in advance, regardless of how much care
they provided, he added.
   Such doctors include those working for health maintenance
organizations, or HMOs, and also physicians who provide prepaid
care in solo and group practices.
   The study, published in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, involved 650 severely depressed patients and more than
500 doctors in Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston. It was conducted by
researchers from the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica; the University of
California, Los Angeles; and New England Medical Center Hospitals
in Boston.
   Compared with general medical doctors' frequent failure to
detect depression, psychiatrists and psychologists recognized more
than 83 percent of seriously depressed patients, the researchers
found.
   Such mental health specialists were equally likely to detect and
treat depressed people regardless of how they were paid, said
Wells, a UCLA psychiatrist and senior researcher at Rand.
   ``I know depression is missed,'' said Dr. Charles McElwee,
president of the Los Angeles County Medical Association. ``All
doctors have to be on the lookout for the depressed patient. This
study will help raise everybody's level of awareness.''
   Stuart Byer, president of the California Association of HMOs,
said he couldn't explain why prepaid doctors were less likely than
others to recognize depression.
   But he said other studies show doctors in HMOs _ which were
established to control spiraling medical costs _ ``deliver better
care by not overprescribing drugs, procedures and hospitalization.''
   Although everyone feels sad at times, 9.4 million Americans
suffer clinical depression during any six-month period, according
to the American Psychiatric Association, which calls depression
``the most common and treatable of all mental illnesses.''
   ``One in four women and one in 10 men can expect to develop it
during their lifetime. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of those
who suffer depression can be effectively treated'' by medication or
psychotherapy, an APA pamphlet said.
   Each year, depression spurs 20,000 suicides and costs $16
billion in lost productivity and medical expenses in the United
States, a 1985 study found.
   Wells said depressed patients in his study felt sad ``all the
time every day for at least two weeks, and also had at least three
other symptoms of depression such as poor sleep or appetite,
suicidal thoughts, difficulty concentrating, having no interest in
things you normally enjoy.''
   The researchers evaluated 22,462 patients who visited doctors
regularly, using detailed diagnostic interviews to pick a
representative sample of 650 severely depressed people.
   Studies in individual hospitals or clinics previously found
doctors often don't recognize depression. Wells said his study is
easily the largest and the first to cover all major types of
medical practice.
   He found general medical doctors paid on a fee-for-service basis
detected only 54 percent of depressed patients, and prepaid doctors
recognized only 42 percent of such people.
   Wells speculated some doctors view treatment of depression as
optional because some patients get well without help. Prepaid plans
are meant to save money, so doctors working for such plans may be
even less likely than others to watch for signs of depression, he
said.
   HMO doctors ``are not encouraged to underserve patients,'' Byer
said. ``Doctors are encouraged to deliver the right care.''

<TEXT>
   An increasingly radical and disillusioned Andrei
D. Sakharov fought until the end to keep the Soviet Union on the
path of reform started by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He died late Thursday while writing a speech to the Soviet
Congress demanding the Communists' constitutional guarantee to
power be revoked, his family said. His last words to them were:
``Tomorrow there will be a battle.''
   Hours earlier, Sakharov made an uncompromising, if not eloquent,
appeal to create a formal political opposition to the Communist
Party and to build a multiparty democracy.
   ``We cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the
leadership is doing now,'' Sakharov told the Inter-Regional group.
``It is leading the country to catastrophe, prolonging the process
of perestroika many years.''
   Sakharov's high-pitched voice, rambling style and stammer made
him a poor public speaker, and despite the group's respect for him,
the hum of other conversations in the hall increased as Sakharov
spoke.
   Sakharov spent his last several days working in the seat of
Soviet power where, until just a few short years ago, he was
roundly and regularly condemned.
   Having supported Gorbachev's reforms in 1987 after the Soviet
leader brought him back from internal exile, Sakharov had taken an
increasingly critical view recently that brought him into conflict
with his president.
   He and other radicals had called for a two-hour general strike
Monday to press for elimination of Article 6 of the Soviet
Constitution, which makes the Communist Party the ``leading and
guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political
system.''
   His last exchange with Gorbachev, shown on live television
several hours after the opening of the Congress' winter session on
Tuesday, was a bitter one.
   Having cut off another deputy who wished to take the podium,
Gorbachev invited Sakharov to address the 2,250-member Congress.
   Sakharov urged the Congress to strike ``all the articles
hindering the passing of laws on land, property and other bills
promoting perestroika.''
   When he began to speak about the party's monopoly on power,
Gorbachev halted him with a curt ``thank you.''
   ``I am under the impression that neither you nor we will know
how to realize your suggestion,'' Gorbachev said. ``Who is to
define what articles to exclude?''
   When Sakharov turned to Gorbachev and handed him a stack of
telegrams in support of his position, the Soviet leader retorted:
``You come to me, I will give you three files of telegrams.''
   Undaunted, Sakharov continued to press the issue.
   Sakharov was elected one of five leaders of the Inter-Regional
Deputies Group when it was formed in August, and he recently had
become one of its more radical and outspoken members.
   Dressed in a brown suit, he sat at the end of the head table,
his chair pushed back and forehead in hand, at the group's meeting
Thursday. With him at the table were the group's other leaders:
historian Yuri Afanasyev, Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin and
economists Gavriil Popov and Viktor Palm.
   The general strike he pressed for on Monday failed, and that
tactic was widely criticized by Inter-Regional deputies Thursday.
One deputy said the strike call was ``present No. 1'' to the
conservatives controlling the Congress, and that the formation of a
political opposition would be ``present No. 2.''
   Historian Roy Medvedev, a long-time acquaintance who also serves
in the Congress of People's Deputies, said in an interview that
Thursday had been a ``difficult day'' for Sakharov.
   ``He wasn't a politician, and didn't always realize the
consequences of his actions, but he never gave in to
circumstances,'' Medvedev said.

   Thousands of elderly people fall and fracture
their hips because they take long-lasting sleeping pills, mainly
Valium, Librium and Dalmane, instead of shorter-acting drugs, a
researcher says.
   The long-acting drugs are no more effective than related,
shorter-acting drugs, but the long-acting drugs were developed
first, and some doctors still are prescribing them to the elderly,
said epidemiologist Wayne A. Ray.
   Ray is co-author of a study published in today's edition of the
Journal of the American Medical Association that found people over
65 who took the long-lasting benzodiazepine drugs were 70 percent
more likely to sustain hip fractures than those who took no such
drugs.
   But shorter-acting benzodiazepines carried no higher risk, the
study said.
   ``Hip fracture is a serious injury,'' Ray said.
   He noted that about 250,000 elderly people fall and break their
hips annually in the United States, resulting in monetary costs of
$6 billion.
   The human costs are even higher, Ray said: a 20 percent
increased death rate in the year after the fracture; a loss of
ability to walk unassisted among up to half the victims; and entry
into nursing homes among up to a third of victims.
   Hip fractures mark ``the beginning of the end'' for many elderly
people, Ray, an associate professor of preventive medicine at
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, said in a
telephone interview Thursday.
   He estimated that 10 percent to 15 percent of people over 65
take benzodiazepine drugs, the most commonly prescribed
tranquilizers and sleeping pills because of their effectiveness and
relative safety.
   ``All have the side effects of reducing coordination and
alertness,'' Ray said, but long-acting benzodiazepines require days
to be eliminated while shorter-acting ones are largely eliminated
in hours.
   He estimated thousands of hip fractures could be prevented each
year if older people stopped using the long-acting drugs.
   Ray's team studied all the hip fractures reported among people
65 and older between 1977 and 1985 in Saskatchewan, Canada, an area
chosen because its health-care system has unusually complete
records.
   The researchers compared use of benzodiazepine tranquilizers and
sleeping pills among 4,501 victims of hip fracture and a control
group of 24,041 Canadians matched for comparison.
   Ray said patients should be encouraged to seek non-drug
alternatives that will help them relax or sleep, such as reducing
caffeine intake, getting more exercise and going to bed later.
   Three drugs accounted for 95 percent of the long-acting
medications taken by study subjects: diazepam, marketed as Valium;
flurazepam, marketed as Dalmane; and chlordiazepoxide, marketed as
Librium. All are manufactured by Roche Laboratories of Nutley, N.J.
   Nancy Mattison, a spokeswoman for Roche, said Thursday, ``It's
been generally recognized that there are some adverse effects like
this on the elderly.''
   But side effects of the short-acting drugs are less well-known
and less predictable than those of longer-acting ones, she said.
   ``Research needs to be completed to identify geriatric patients
that may be at highest risk of hip fracture at the same time as
taking benzodiazepines,'' Ms. Mattison said.
   Short-acting benzodiazepines that accounted for 95 percent of
those taken by subjects in the study were: triazolam, marketed as
Halcion by the Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich.; oxazepam, marketed
as Serax by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of Phildelphia; and
lorazepam, marketed as Ativan by Wyeth-Ayerst.

   A former prostitute who accused the priest who
founded a runaway shelter of financial and sexual improprieties is
welcome to come back in off the streets, the Rev. Bruce Ritter said
after denying the charges.
   ``If he came back today we would welcome him back to Convenant
House,'' Ritter said at a news conference Thursday. ``There are
many people here who care very deeply about him.''
   Prosecutor Robert Morgenthau confirmed Wednesday he was
investigating the man's charges of financial improprieties by
Ritter. The 20-year-old former Covenant House resident also
reportedly claimed he had a sexual relationship with the Franciscan
priest.
   ``I categorically deny these allegations,'' Ritter said. ``They
are simply nonsense.''
   Ritter and the authorities have not publicly identified the man,
but a law enforcement source identified him as Timothy Warner.
   Ritter said the charges were ``deeply offensive to me,'' and had
seriously harmed the image of the charitable organization. An
audit, he said, ``found our books in perfect order. Every penny is
accounted for.''
   Ritter founded Covenant House for homeless teen-agers in 1969
and has built it into an $85 million-a-year operation with seven
shelters in the United States, one in Toronto and four in Latin
America. More than 90 percent of its funding is private.
   Covenant House directly serves about 25,000 children annually,
and its national telephone line gets about a million calls for help
a year.
   Ritter said the young man came to the agency early this year
saying he was a runaway prostitute being pursued by organized crime.
   Covenant House in Manhattan currently has about 150 other
runaways in similar straits, he said. They are given special
attention and a personal mentor.
   ``I chose to become his mentor because, frankly, I had more
experience than anyone else,'' he said.
   Staff members took the man to their homes on special occasions,
and Ritter acknowledged traveling with him on a few occasions, but
said there were no sexual relations.
   The man was enrolled at Manhattan College, but eventually
dropped out and lapsed back into prostitution.
   Ritter blamed himself for not spending enough time with the
young man.
   ``We tried so very hard, and we failed,'' he said. ``It is
probably better to say that I failed. ... I thought I knew more
than I did.''
   Asked why the man would have accused him of such transgressions,
Ritter replied, ``I honestly, simply do not know.''
   He said he last spoke with the man in early November, telling
him to either go back to college or get a job. The man refused
either option and left the apartment Covenant House had provided
him on Dec. 5, he said.
   The priest said he was most concerned that supporters ``have had
their faith in me shattered,'' and would not be willing to continue
their aid.
   Ritter, who has pursued a vigorous travel schedule in recent
years despite a bout with cancer, calls Covenant House ``an
intensive care unit for dying children.''
   ``We help about one-third of the kids that come in,'' he said in
an interview last year. ``We lose the rest.''

   Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. and Toyota Corp. will
ask a judge to set aside a $43.2 million judgment for a woman whose
husband and two daughters burned to death in a 1982 car fire,
officials said.
   Jurors in a state district court awarded $18.2 million in actual
damages and $25 million in exemplary damages _ the largest ever
against Toyota _ to Nike Adegbite, 36, who watched as her family
and two others were killed in the fire.
   Douglas West, vice president and general counsel for Toyota
Motors in Torrance, Calif., said the company was surprised and
disappointed by Wednesday's verdict, and will ask for a new trial.
   If the judge refuses, Toyota will appeal the judgment, West said.
   Mrs. Adegbite escaped with only minor burns and cuts from the
1973 Toyota Corona station wagon when it caught fire after being
rear-ended by a van.
   Her husband, Adeyemi, 35, and her daughters, Yetunde, 7, and
Adeloa, 8 months, were killed. The van's driver, Boyo Adetoye,
received minor injuries, but his wife and child were killed.
   Mrs. Adegbite's attorney, Stan Pfeiffer, said the lawsuit
claimed Toyota was negligent in its design of the station wagon and
failed to recall it. The trial lasted six weeks.
   The attorney said Mrs. Adegbite and her family were in the back
seat of the station wagon when it was struck on a Houston highway
Sept. 26, 1982. The van's impact pushed the station wagon's
gasoline tank forward, Pfeiffer said, and the tank was punctured by
an empty spare tire carrier and a valve on the rear axle.
   Adetoye was not involved in the case because he had reached a
settlement on a similar lawsuit about a year ago, Pfeiffer said.
The settlement amount was not disclosed.
   West said Toyota has never had any other claims against the
design of the vehicle. He added the company denies any defects or
negligence in the vehicle's design.
   Lawyers on both sides expressed surprise at the size of the
judgment.
   ``We were of course surprised at the verdict _ not only by the
extraordinary amount, but that the jury decided against us,'' West
said.
   Previously, the largest award against Toyota was about $5
million, he said.
   Ms. Adegbite was surprised, too, said Pfeiffer.
   ``I think everybody was. It was an emotional moment,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Patients and their families are launching their own drives to
find bone marrow donors although they have only a slight chance of
finding a stranger with the same tissue type.
   The extraordinary efforts are being undertaken because the
nation's bone marrow registry of tissue-typed volunteers is growing
yet lags painfully behind demand, experts say.
   Elaine Chin of Naperville, Ill., is asking members of Chicago's
Asian community to be tested in hopes of finding a donor for her
son, Ray Jr., 20, a leukemia victim. On Sunday, tests were
performed on 117 people at a cost to the family of $75 per person,
or $8,775. Results are expected in a few days.
   ``It's not for my son only,'' Mrs. Chin said. ``Every person I
recruit goes into the national donor program.''
   The problem her son and others face is that, on average,
patients who are not lucky enough to have a relative with the same
tissue type have only a one-in-20,000 chance of finding a stranger
with the same type _ and chances are even worse for ethnic
minorities and people with rare tissue types.
   By comparison, there are basically only four blood types, making
the matching of blood donors and recipients relatively easy.
   ``The only way to solve that problem is to have more (marrow)
donors,'' said Dr. Don Thomas of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle.
   Bone marrow is the source of red and white blood cells, plus
platelets required for clotting. It can be destroyed by disease, or
as a side effect of treatment for cancer.
   More than 20,000 bone marrow transplants were performed
worldwide on leukemia victims and other patients through 1987, the
last year for which figures are available, said Dr. Mortimer
Bortin. He is scientific director of the International Bone Marrow
Transplant Registry, a research group at the Medical College of
Wisconsin in Milwaukee.
   About 98 percent were matches between siblings of identical
tissue type, Bortin said.
   Two years ago today, Thomas performed the first transplant
arranged through the federally funded National Marrow Donor Program.
   The bone marrow was removed from a 49-year-old medical secretary
from Milwaukee on Dec. 15, 1987, sent to the Hutchinson center and
injected the next day into leukemia patient Brooke Ward of Raleigh,
N.C.
   Even though it was a so-called perfect tissue match, there was
still enough of a difference that Brooke, now 8, has since suffered
several bouts of graft-vs.-host disease, in which white blood cells
from the transplanted marrow attack the host body, according to her
mother, Marguriete Ward.
   ``I didn't think we'd still be battling it two years down the
road,'' Mrs. Ward said in a telephone interview Wednesday. Still,
she said, ``We had no other choice. It was either that or death. I
would take this any day.''
   She said doctors have told her the problem could lessen over
time.
   The National Marrow Donor Program, located in St. Paul, Minn.,
currently lists about 70,000 potential donors for those without
compatible siblings, said spokeswoman Liz Quam. That includes 3,400
from the Netherlands, which merged its program with the American
registry last spring.
   Even with that number of potential donors, only about 10 percent
of those who consult the national registry are matched and
transplanted, said Dr. Paul McCurdy, the program's project officer
for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
   England's bone marrow registry, the world's largest with 130,000
names, also has a reciprocal sharing arrangement with the United
States as do France, Canada, Israel and Australia. Other Western
European countries and Japan are expected to follow suit within six
months.
   Getting people's tissue type determined so that their names can
be entered in the registry takes only a blood test. But for those
volunteers who are found to match the type of someone needing a
transfusion, the actual donation of bone marrow requires general
anaesthesia and up to a 48-hour hospital stay. The marrow is
removed by means of a needle inserted into the pelvic bone.
   The government originally intended to have 100,000 potential
donors by the third year of the registry, launched Sept. 1, 1987,
said McCurdy.
   That target now is thought to be low.
   ``How many people would you have to have in a registry to assure
everyone would have a donor? It's not known,'' said the University
of Pittsburgh's Dr. Richard Shadduck, director of the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute's adult bone marrow transplant program.

<HEAD>Troops Rushed to City After Coup Plan Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of troops were rushed to a
major southern city amid reports today that rebel soldiers plan new
attacks against President Corazon Aquino.
   Also today, the nation's leading cleric delivered an unusually
strong attack on inefficiency and nepotism in the Aquino
government, which has been deeply shaken by the failed coup that
was launched Dec. 1.
   Prices tumbled in early trading on The Manila Stock Exchange
until the government's social security system and other
institutional investors intervened to prevent a feared collapse.
   Traders attributed the panic selling to Thursday's grenade
attack on an American housing and recreational compound. There were
no injuries and minor damage. But the incident raised fears of
terrorism by remnants of military mutineers who tried to topple
Mrs. Aquino.
   The exchange's composite index of 25 selected issues plunged
59.73 points to close at 1,002.81, down 5.62 percent from
Thursday's finish. Before the rally, exchange President Gerardo
Urban warned the market was ``collapsing and it has lost its
sanity.''
   Business sources have expressed concern that the Aquino
government will be unable to cope with the economic, political and
social effects of the failed coup.
   In Davao, 560 miles south of here, Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccay
said 500 Marines were flown to the city early today from Zamboanga
to secure the airport, banks and other key installations following
reports of rebel troop movements.
   Baccay told reporters that an unknown number of rebels had left
their garrison, about 150 miles north of Davao, but it was
uncertain where they were heading. Roadblocks had been set up near
Davao, the largest city on Mindanao island.
   On Thursday, Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, who comes from Mindanao,
warned of a possible coup attempt on the island in the next two
weeks. Rodolfo Canieso, chief of the government intelligence
service, told a Senate committee that rebels were planning a new
strike against the Aquino administration in the central Visayas
islands and Mindanao.
   Canieso, a retired major general and former army commander, said
60 percent of the 160,000-member armed forces would accept whatever
government emerged victorious in a future coup.
   In Manila, Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop of
Manila, called for stern punishment for mutineers but criticized
the Aquino administration for its stewardship of the nation.
   ``The perpetrators of the coup must definitely be hunted down
and punished,'' Sin told a conference of Filipino ambassadors.
``But beyond that, the presidency must be freed of every taint of
nepotism. The fruits of economic recovery must be distributed more
equitably.''
   Sin has been among Mrs. Aquino's most outspoken supporters since
the 1986 ``people power'' uprising, when he called hundreds of
thousands into the streets to join the revolution that toppled the
late President Ferdinand Marcos and put Mrs. Aquino in power.
   During the speech, Sin said the country appeared quiet for the
moment ``like the silence in the eye of a typhoon.''
   ``Unsettling is the actual inefficiency in many branches of
government,'' Sin said. ``Unsettling are the unceasing reports of
the undue influence of presidential relatives in official
government policy. ...Unsettling is the omnipresence still of so
much poverty, so much suffering in our country.''
   No group claimed responsibility for the grenade attack on the
U.S. Seafront compound. But Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief of
the police Capital Command, said the attackers could have been
rebel soldiers angry at U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino.
   The incident followed threats against U.S. interests by rebel
soldiers after U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for government
forces during the coup attempt, which ended Saturday. At least 113
people were killed in the eight-day coup.
   Half of the estimated 3,000 troops who took part in the coup
attempt, the sixth and most serious insurrection of Mrs. Aquino's
regime.

<TEXT>
   A fire that killed four retirement home
residents _ the fifth blaze in six months at a Virginia nursing or
retirement home _ renewed a call for a study of fire safety in the
state's housing for the elderly.
   The fire Thursday at Shenandoah Homes Retirement Community was
the third fatal fire there in 13 years. It injured 23 people, but
residents, rescue workers and TV cameramen ushered others to safety
in early-morning cold.
   A preliminary report on the cause of the fire probably would be
released today, said Capt. Mark Light of the Roanoke County fire
and rescue department.
   After an Oct. 5 fire killed 12 residents of a nursing home in
Norfolk, state Sen. Stanley Walker, D-Norfolk, drafted the bill
calling for the fire-safety study. Lawmakers will consider it next
year.
   ``It's sad that it takes a tragedy to get people to move,''
Walker said Thursday.
   The fire broke out shortly after 2 a.m. in a third-floor
apartment at Shenandoah Homes.
   Only the second floor of the six-story building is licensed as a
home for adults and regulated by the state. The remaining floors
are considered a boarding home because residents require less
medical care than in adult homes and nursing homes, state officials
said.
   Residents, many wearing only pajamas, streamed out of exits into
the 19-degree cold. Some were aided by wheelchairs and walkers and
others were helped by fellow residents, rescue personnel and even
TV cameramen.
   ``I left my walker, got my cane and everybody helped each other
get out,'' said Marjorie Branson, 78, wrapped in a blanket.
   ``It was just a marvel how these elderly people reacted under
pressure,'' said Ottis Burgher, administrator of the 190-occupant
facility.
   In 1976, a fire killed four residents of the Shenandoah home.
Three months earlier, a blaze started by a dropped cigarette killed
a woman.
   Fires struck a nursing home in Albemarle County on Dec. 6, a
retirement home in Charlottesville on Oct. 25 and a nursing home in
Chesapeake on June 30. The fires prompted evacuations but caused no
major injuries.

<UNK>Presidential Candidates Clash in TV Debate Two Days Before Vote ^By
TODD LEWAN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two candidates vying to become
Brazil's first popularly elected president in nearly three decades
traded barbs and insults in a crucial nationwide debate.
   The 2{-hour showdown between Fernando Collor de Mello, a
center-right former governor, and leftist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva
comes in the stretch drive of Sunday's election. New polls show
that da Silva has erased a 15-point deficit in the last two weeks
to make the race almost dead even.
   Both candidates ducked questions about inflation, expected to
rise 50 percent in December alone. Instead they traded personal
barbs during the debate that began Thursday and ended early today.
   Collor de Mello, shouting and shaking his fists in the air at
times, called his socialist rival ``intolerant'' and ``backward''
and said the election of da Silva would prompt nationwide strikes
and economic chaos.
   Da Silva labeled Collor de Mello as ``emotionally unstable'' and
a member of the ``archaic upper class.''
   Da Silva, 44, a congressman of the Workers Party and former
labor leader, instead focused on issues such as redistribution of
land and wealth and state-funded health care and educational
reforms.
   Da Silva said if elected he would suspend payments on Brazil's
$110 billion foreign debt, the Third World's largest, and invest
the money for social programs.
   Brazil paid $14 billion last year servicing its foreign debt,
according to the Central Bank.
   Collor de Mello, 40, the scion of a wealthy political clan and
former governor of the tiny northeastern state of Alagoas, said a
debt moratorium would hurt foreign investment and stunt economic
growth.
   Instead, the National Reconstruction Party candidate favored
cuts in state spending and supported making several state-run
companies private.
   ``The idea of turning our backs on our debt is flawed,'' Collor
de Mello said. ``The present government has already stopped
payments and where has it gotten us?''
   Brazil has effectively halted all interest payments on its
commercial debt since September.
   Da Silva called land reform and housing programs essential for
development in Brazil.
   He said his government would donate plots of land to homeless
families in cities and subsidize the construction of homes. He did
not specify how the government _ strapped with an enormous internal
debt and the burden of paying a bloated government staff _ would
pay for these projects.
   Collor de Mello proposed offering incentives to private
developers to ease the housing cruch.
   On Sunday, an estimated 82 million voters will go to the polls
to choose Brazil's first popularly elected president since 1960.
   Analysts say the election rides on how well each candidate
portrays himself as the defender of the poor, who make up a
majority of the electorate.
   Collor de Mello's promises to clean up corrupt government and
sharp attacks on discredited President Jose Sarney have been
popular with poor Brazilians and gave him a plurality but not the
required majority in elections last month.
   In the last two weeks, opinion polls say da Silva has closed the
gap rapidly, in part because of a strong performance in the
candidates' first nationwide debate Dec. 3.
   The last popular election for president was in 1960, when Janio
Quadros was elected. In 1964, the armed forces took power in a coup
and ruled the country until 1985.
   Sarney, a civilian, was chosen in an electoral college vote
coordinated by the country's top generals.

   A man, his adopted teen-age daughter and
her friend succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning as they waited in
a car for a school bus that passed without stopping to help them,
authorities said.
   James Richard McClain, 42, had driven his daughter, Misty, 15,
and her friend, Billy Payne, 16, to a bus stop Thursday to wait for
the regular 7 a.m. bus, Barbour County Sheriff Guy Steerman said.
   All three apparently had lost consciousness by the time the bus
stopped on U.S. 119 and moved on at 7:22 a.m., Steerman said.
   Jeff Maxson, owner of Maxson's Salvage, a service station where
the car was parked, said the 1977 Pontiac station wagon was
``steamed up'' and covered with a thin layer of snow when he and a
co-worker found the bodies at about 8 a.m. as they opened for
business.
   ``It was pretty cold and they lived up the hollow and he
(McClain) just brought them down for the bus as he did every day,''
Steerman said. ``They usually had to wait about seven or eight
minutes, but the bus got hung up on a secondary road by the snow
and the slick roads and it was late approximately 20 minutes.''
   Steerman and Maxson said those aboard the school bus apparently
did not aid the three even though they waited in the same car every
day at the service station.
   ``They was supposed to stop and look but the car was steamed up
so bad they couldn't see in it,'' Maxson said.
   ``I thought he was asleep,'' Maxson said. ``I beat on the
windows ... and tried to get them awake. I shoved the guy and he
wouldn't wake up. I hollered at him and called him by name.''
   Steerman said he believed the fatal fumes came from a rusted
exhaust pipe.
   Misty McClain had been adopted earlier this year, authorities
said.
   Steerman said authorities were ``pretty sure'' the deaths were
caused by carbon monoxide poisoning, and did not know whether an
autopsy was planned.
   Philippi, a town of about 3,100 people, is about 120 miles south
of Pittsburgh.

<HEAD>Alleged Colombia Drug Dealer Extradited to United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An alleged Colombian cocaine dealer has been
extradited to the United States to face prosecution in connection
with the importation of more than 100 kilograms of cocaine, the
U.S. Marshals Service says.
   Nelson Cuevas Ramirez, 55, who was indicted on drug charges by a
federal grand jury in Manhattan in October, was turned over by
Colombia authorities at 7 p.m. EST Thursday in Bogota, Marshals
Service Director K. Michael Moore announced in a statement released
here early today.
   Ramirez was immediately flown to the United States, arriving in
New York City at 4:15 a.m. EST, Moore said.
   Ramirez is the tenth person to be extradited from Columbia since
August when Barco began a new drive against drug trafficking, and
the first since a massive truck bomb exploded in front of the
offices of Bogota's federal investigative police Dec. 6, killing at
least 35 people and wounding hundreds.
   U.S. Marshal Romolo J. Imundi of the southern district of New
York said Ramirez was in custody pending arraignment in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan. Ramirez' exact whereabouts were
withheld for his protection.
   The federal indictment accuses Ramirez of conspiracy to import
and distribute about 150 kilograms of cocaine, and the importation
and possession with intent to distribute 111 kilograms of cocaine.
   Negotiations for the cocaine allegedly occurred in Panama, and
the 111 kilograms were seized in April 1987 at the Westchester
County Airport in New York, Moore said.
   ``President Virgilio Barco and the government of Colombia are
again to be applauded for their continued courage and resolve in
standing up to the narco-terrorists through these continued
extraditions,'' Moore said.
   According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, as many as 300
Colombians already are under indictment in various U.S. cities on
drug-related charges, although many of the indictments are sealed.

<HEAD>Study: Hair Sample Better Than Urine Sample for Detecting Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests to detect cocaine use should be done on
hair samples as well as urine samples because a hair analysis will
detect drug abuse months afterward, a study published today says.
   But an editorial accompanying the study in the Journal of the
American Medical Association said hair analysis is unreliable and
unwieldy.
   The study said hair sampling cannot completely replace urine
testing since it won't detect cocaine use in ``the recent few
days'' as urinalysis does, but hair analysis can uncover whether
someone has long used drugs.
   ``While a urine test may be negative, this hair test will make
it very difficult to hide a history of drug use,'' Dr. Gideon
Koren, an author of the study, said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
   Koren and colleagues at The Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto did an analysis in 1987 of urine and hair samples from 21
healthy adults who reported no cocaine use.
   They compared results of the test with an analysis of urine and
hair samples from seven pregnant admitted cocaine users who got
prenatal counseling at the Motherisk Clinic in Toronto and nine
cocaine addicts from the medical ward at the Addiction Research
Foundation in Toronto.
   Urine samples from the groups tested negative.
   Hair tests for the users, some of whom participated in a
treatment program and had quit, reflected that they had once used
the drug but later had quit, Koren said.
   ``If an adult chooses to stop taking the drug several days
before the (urine) test _ and chooses to tell you that he didn't
use the drug _ there is no way you can tell,'' said Koren, an
author of the study. ``But there is one place in the body where
cocaine gets in and does not know how to get out, and that's the
hair.''
   In the editorial, however, Dr. David N. Bailey of the University
of California School of Medicine said hair analysis is ``unwieldy
for use by most laboratories other than research laboratories.''
   He questioned the reliability of hair analysis, saying dyeing or
bleaching hair could taint test results, as could exposure to
automobile exhaust fumes or other substances that might cause the
drugs to deteriorate.
   ``While, at first glance, this practice may seem to be an
efficacious one, it likely will not become standard for some time,
if at all,'' he said.
   Koren said he has heard that hair analysis is being used on the
West Coast of the United States by a firm which does testing for
industries. He had no other information and said he had seen no
previous studies on the method.
   In the test, a hair sample is subjected to a chemical process
called radioimmunoassay, which reduces it to a solution that can be
analyzed for a cocaine derivative.
   ``Hair grows about 1 centimeter per month, so we can tell if
someone stopped the cocaine a couple of months ago _ the new hair
near the scalp will not have the cocaine anymore,'' Koren said.
   He said the researchers' main target was to find a way of
determining drug use in pregnant women who do not admit it.
   ``If there is a baby that looks very sick or has problems that
cannot be explained by other factors, we can tell with this test,''
he said. ``This means that in the future, if we find cocaine in the
hair of a baby, even if the mother does not admit using it, that
means she did use it.''

<TEXT>
   A new federal drug law that imposes
mandatory prison sentences is drawing complaints from California
judges who say their authority is being undermined.
   ``I don't think it's the world's most popular thing with
judges,'' said William Ingram, chief federal judge for the Northern
District of California.
   ``We get in this business and over the years presumably develop
some educated discretion with respect to disposition of criminal
cases, and that just takes discretion away. You have to comply with
the statute, but I think many judges wish the statute would be
repealed.''
   Two weeks ago, the issue came to a boil in the courtroom of U.S.
District Judge Robert Schnacke, a former longtime federal
prosecutor and 1970 judicial appointee of President Richard Nixon.
   The case was one where a crack cocaine prosecution in state
court, with a maximum 12-year sentence, was transferred by
prosecutors to federal court where penalties are stiffer _ in this
case, a mandatory life term without parole because of defendant
David Hamilton's two prior convictions.
   As jurors prepared to deliberate, Schnacke said he would
normally tell them to ignore possible penalties because those were
up to him. But since he had no choice of sentence, he said, they
should know that a conviction would be punished by life without
parole.
   On Dec. 1, the jury acquitted Hamilton, 30, of San Francisco, of
the drug charge, convicting him only of a gun-possession charge
that has yet to be sentenced. Schnacke thanked the jurors ``for
what I take to be an expression of concern about the nature of the
compelled sentencing process that Congress has imposed upon the
courts.''
   The new federal drug law, effective last November, requires
prison sentences without parole for certain types of drug crimes _
decisions that were formerly left up to the sentencing judge.
   A first offender who possessed over 50 grams of crack cocaine
for sale, for example, must serve at least 10 years without parole.
With a prior felony drug conviction, the minimum sentence is 20
years, and with two prior drug felonies the mandatory sentence is
life without the possibility of parole.
   ``Mandatory minimum (sentences) applied to some kinds of cases
result in shocking injustice,'' said federal Judge William
Schwarzer. ``Judges are going to struggle to find ways to perform
their sworn constitutional duty to do justice.''
   Federal judges at all levels in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which covers California and eight other Western states,
voted overwhelmingly earlier this year to urge Congress to repeal
the mandatory sentencing laws.
   But U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello said Schnacke's action was
unprecedented and had virtually dictated the verdict, although
Hamilton's lawyer quoted jurors as saying the prosecution had
failed to prove drug possession. Russoniello complained to U.S.
Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, but conceded there was nothing he
could do because an acquittal cannot be appealed.

<HEAD>Nurse Faces 50 Years to Life for Deaths of Patients</HEAD>

   Jurors wept as they heard the testimony
of a patient who survived a dose of a paralyzing drug from a
hospital nurse, then convicted Richard Angelo for causing four
deaths.
   Angelo stared straight ahead Thursday during the reading of the
verdict finding him guilty of murder in two deaths, manslaughter in
a third and criminally negligent homicide in a fourth.
   ``What this guy did to all of these people is beyond words,''
said a sobbing Kieran Greene, 24, whose father, Anthony, was one of
Angelo's victims. Greene hugged prosecutor John Collins after the
verdict was announced.
   Angelo, 27, faces a maximum of 50 years to life for the murders
when sentenced Jan. 17.
   Less than an hour before the verdict, jurors in the eighth day
of deliberations listened to testimony by former patient Gerolamo
Kucich, a 75-year-old Yugoslavian.
   ``I was actually putting myself in his shoes,'' juror Michael
Loguercio said of Kucich. ``I walked out of there in tears this
morning.''
   Kucich testified during the trial that while he was a patient
Angelo had given him an injection saying it would ``make me feel
better.'' Instead, Kucich was left fighting for breath.
   ``This is probably a fair verdict,'' said defense attorney Eric
Naiburg.
   The injections, lethal doses of muscle relaxants, occurred at
Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip on Long Island in the fall of
1987.
   Angelo, who was a nurse in the intensive care unit for about six
months, admitted to police he had planned to inject the patients,
then be first on the scene to revive them and be seen as a hero.
   The jury also convicted Angelo on Thursday of assault charges in
the deaths and in the injections he gave Kucich. He was acquitted
of assaulting two patients whose deaths were not proved to be from
the drugs.
   Naiburg had conceded in his closing statement that Angelo
injected the patients and that he may have caused some of their
deaths. But he had argued that Angelo was not aware that the
injections presented a grave risk to the patients, a condition
necessary for a murder conviction.
   He had urged the jurors to find Angelo guilty of criminally
negligent homicide, a lesser charge punishable by up to four years
in jail.
   The prosecutor, John Collins, calling Angelo ``a monster in
nurse's whites,'' had argued that Angelo had to know the risks
involved, especially after the first victim died.
   Suffolk County officials exhumed 33 bodies of patients at Good
Samaritan who died suspiciously during Angelo's tenure. The medical
examiner found traces of Pavulon in six of the bodies exhumed. A
Pavulon-laced syringe was found in Angelo's apartment the day
before his arrest.
   County Court Judge Alfred Tisch remanded Angelo without bail
Thursday to the county jail, where he has been held since his
arrest.

<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of the life of Soviet human
rights champion and parliamentarian Andrei D. Sakharov, who died
Thursday at 68:
   1948 _ Joins crash program to build a Soviet thermonuclear bomb.
   1953 _ With Sakharov's research supplying the key, the Soviet
Union detonates its first hydrogen bomb. Three months later, at 32,
he becomes the youngest full member ever of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences.
   1956 _ Receives second award as Hero of Socialist Labor. Adds
second Order of Lenin to earlier Stalin prize.
   1957 _ Warns in scientific journal that atmospheric testing of
nuclear weapons could cause genetic harm.
   1958 _ Criticizes Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's plan to send
students to factories and farms.
   1961 _ Urges Khrushchev to halt nuclear tests. Such decisions,
Khrushchev replies, should not concern scientists. ``After that,''
Sakharov later said, ``I was a different man.''
   1965 _ Shifts research to theories concerning the structure of
the universe.
   1966 _ Signs letter with other Soviet intellectuals warning
against a revival of Stalinism under Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
   1967 _ Decries the industrial pollution of Lake Baikal.
   1968 _ Becomes world famous with U.S. publication of the
10,000-word work ``Progress, Coexistence and Intellectual
Freedom,'' calling for Moscow to join the West in a campaign
against pollution, hunger and war. The Kremlin revokes his security
clearance.
   1970 _ Organizes unofficial Moscow Committee on Human Rights,
and calls for democratic rule. Meets Yelena Bonner, a doctor from
Leningrad and fellow dissident.
   1971 _ Marries Bonner.
   1973 _ Steps up criticism of Soviet oppression despite his first
warnings from authorities that his activities, particularly
statements to Western reporters, are used by the West as
anti-Soviet slander. Fellow members of the Soviet Academy denounce
him as a ``tool of enemy propaganda.''
   1975 _ Becomes the first Soviet winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.
The Kremlin denies him an exit visa to travel to Oslo, Norway, to
accept the award. Bonner accepts it for him, and at the ceremonies
reads his appeal for an open Soviet society.
   1980 _ Condemns the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and backs the
boycott of the Moscow Olympics. KGB agents seize him on a Moscow
street, and he is exiled to the city of Gorky 250 miles east of
Moscow without a trial.
   1981 _ Joins Bonner in a 16-day hunger strike to press for visa
for her son's wife, Liza Alexeyeva, to join her husband, Alexei
Semyonov, in the United States. The visa is granted after the
couple is hospitalized and threatened with force-feeding.
   1982 _ Sakharov is denied treatment for a heart ailment at
special center for academy members.
   1984 _ Sakharov starts second hunger strike, demanding Bonner be
allowed to receive medical treatment aboard. Five days later he is
removed to a hospital, where he suffers a possible stroke while
being force-fed under KGB supervision.
   1985 _ Leaves hospital, returns to apartment.
   1986 _ Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev says Sakharov knows
military secrets and must remain in the Soviet Union. In December,
on Gorbachev's intervention, Sakharov is allowed to return to
Moscow, where he voices support for Gorbachev's reform program.
   1987 _ Calls for an ``open democratic'' Soviet Union at
officially organized Moscow Peace Forum.
   1988 _ Meets face-to-face with Gorbachev for the first time and
hands him a list of 200 political prisoners he wants freed. In

from the Academy of Sciences after reformers object the first round
of elections were rigged. In speeches to the Congress in May and
June, he criticizes Gorbachev for accumulating too much power and
defends his stand on Afghanistan. After dinner Dec. 14, he dies
while preparing a speech demanding repeal of the Communist Party's
constitutional monopoly on power.

<HEAD>Curfew Imposed in Moslem City, Security Tightened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ASKARI ZAIDI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities imposed an curfew here today
to prevent Moslem separatists from celebrating the government's
decision to free five jailed militants in ransom deal.
   The government released the five to secure the freedom of a
Cabinet minister's daughter held captive by Moslem militants for
six days.
   In New Delhi, new Prime Minister V.P. Singh met with reporters
for the first time as chief of state and defended his decision to
release the militants.
   ``We are not bowing to terrorists. We saw the overall situation
and took the decision,'' said Singh, who assumed power earlier this
month, succeeding Rajiv Gandhi.
   Singh said the government would review the situation in the
northern state of Jammu-Kashmir, where militant Moslems are finding
increasing support for their campaign to secede from India.
   ``We will assess the situation but are not in favor of
precipitate action because it is a delicate situation,'' he said.
``There are a lot of problems at the people's level. We have to
tackle it in a very deft way with a lot of flexibility.''
   S.S. Ali, deputy inspector general of police in Jammu-Kashmir
state, said security forces had orders to shoot curfew violators.
   Witnesses said police fired at a group of people who tried to
defy curfew in Srinagar, home of 700,000 people and the summer
capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. But they did not know if there were
any casualties.
   About 150 soldiers were called out in Srinagar, and two armored
personnel carriers were stationed at the city's main intersection,
witnesses said.
   Paramiliitary troops from the Border Security Force and the
Central Reserve Police Force also were deployed in the towns of
Anantnag and Baramulla.
   In Anantnag, Moslem militants fired at a police patrol and
injured one policeman, Ali said. Police returned fire, injuring six
of the attackers.
   The jailed militants, all members of the Kashmir Liberation
Front, were released Wednesday in exchange for Rubaiya Sayeed, a
medical intern and the daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad
Sayeed, a Moslem and a Kashmiri.
   Ms. Sayeed, 22, was kidnapped on Dec. 8, and her release came
after five days of hectic negotiations with the abductors who twice
threatened to kill her.
   The swap sparked celebtations in the Moslem-majority state and
large groups of people shouted anti-India slogans and waved the
national flag of neighboring Pakistan.
   The militants have been demanding the secession of the state
from India and gaining either autonomy of assimilation into Islamic
Pakistan.
   ``We fear that the terrorists may try to create lots of
disturbance, hence we have taken the steps,'' Ali said.
   Kashmir is India's only Moslem majority state. Moslems make up
64 percent of the state's 5 million people, but only about 11
percent of the country's 880 million people.
   The Kashmir Liberation Front, formed in 1965, advocates
secession of Jammu-Kashmir to become either independent or part of
Islamic Pakistan.
   Kashmir is claimed by both India and Pakistan, and the two
countries have fought three wars over the territory since gaining
independence from Britain in 1947. A ceasefire line mointored by
the United Nations separates the state into Indian and Pakistani
territory.
   On Thursday, two teen-age boys were killed when security forces
fired on rampaging Moslems separatists in Sapore town. Moslems mobs
attacked a police station and freed some prisoners.
   Trouble spread to the neighboring town of Baramullah, where
violent mobs attacked an army motor convoy, Ali said. An
18-year-old boy, Mohammad Yusuf, was killed when soldiers opened
fire on the crowd in self-defense, he said.
   Curfew was imposed in both towns Thursday. Both towns are about
35 miles north of Srinagar.
   Sayeed is the first Moslem to be named to the sensitive post
that oversees police and internal security. The appointment on Dec.
5 was seen as part of the Singh's efforts to appease India's Moslem
minority who have borne the brunt of Hindu-Moslem religious riots
this fall that claimed 300 lives.

<HEAD>State Drops $100 Million Santa Monica Bay Pollution Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state water agency dropped its $100 million
lawsuit against the city in exchange for municipal promises to
spend even more to cut the flow of pollution into once pristine
Santa Monica Bay.
   The bay fronting some of the world's most-visited beaches has
provided background scenery to Hollywood productions, including the
``Beach Blanket'' movies, ``Gidget'' TV series and the film
``Tequila Sunrise.''
   It touches about 40 miles of wide, white-sand beach from the
Palos Verdes peninsula in the south to Malibu in the north.
   The agreement between the Regional Water Quality Control Board
and the city of Los Angeles lists 22 measures the city must pursue,
with costs estimated to surpass $100 million, officials said
Thursday.
   ``This is the way controversies between two government agencies
should be handled,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said. ``Instead of fighting
it out in the courts, we solved it at the bargaining table.''
   The city agreed to take steps to prevent raw sewage spills at a
treatment plant, reduce pollutants washing out to sea from storm
drains and improve sewage treatment.
   A rash of sewage spills in 1987 prompted county health officials
to close miles of beach, angering surfers, scuba divers and
environmentalists.
   The city also pledged to create new water reclamation and
conservation programs and stage a museum exhibit to heighten public
awareness on bay pollution.
   The pact was approved by the City Council in a closed-door
meeting Tuesday and announced on Thursday.
   Virtually all costs will be borne by the city's sewage surcharge
tax imposed on homeowners and commercial landlords, city officials
said.
   State Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp filed the suit in
1987, seeking penalties of up to $20 a gallon for two major spills
that dumped more than 5.4 million gallons of raw sewage into the
bay.

<HEAD>Plan for More Smog-Free Cars Approved in California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Air Resources Board has approved a
plan that could lead to widescale use of alternative fuels in
California vehicles after 1997.
   The proposed requirements _ would have major implications for
auto makers and oil companies, as well as for consumers _ go far
beyond 1994 emission limits for conventional gasoline-powered cars
that were adopted in June.
   The new regulations would probably require use of such fuels as
methanol, compressed natural gas and electricity. New emission
control technologies would also be required.
   ``This is the first time we've started to wean people away from
gasoline and cars as we know them,'' Air Resources Board spokesman
Bill Sessa said Thursday.
   The limits were contained in a board staff proposal that would
have to be approved by the board next September.
   Without a new generation of motor vehicles, the board said,
Southern California air will not be able to meet federal clean air
standards.
   Beginning in 1997, one out of every four cars sold in the state
would have to emit 70 percent fewer hydrocarbons than required by
the 1994 standard, under the proposal. By 1998, half of all cars
sold would be required to meet the tougher standard.
   In effect, this would mean two tailpipe standards _ one for
conventional gasoline cars, based on the 1994 standard, and another
for so-called ``low-emission cars,'' which the state would require
to be sold in California.
   The 1997 standard limits hydrocarbon emissions to 0.075 grams
per mile. The 1994 standard limits them to 0.25 grams per mile.
   Federal standards now set hydrocarbon limits at 0.41 grams per
mile. Over time, the market share of low-emission cars would grow
from less than 10 percent in 1994 to 100 percent of new cars sold
in the year 2000, officials said.
   Oil companies would be required to sell alternative fuels at
their service stations as a condition for continuing to sell
gasoline in the state. Automobile makers would be required to make
the lower-emission vehicles in order to meet the tougher standards.
   Industry representatives said the proposed timetable was
unrealistically fast and may not be technologically feasible.
   The Air Quality Management District, which regulates air quality
in the Los Angeles area, said that next year it will consider a
rule requiring operators of fleets of more than 15 vehicles to
begin purchasing alternative, cleaner-fueled vehicles.
   The district's goal is to have 40 percent of all cars, 70
percent of all trucks and 100 percent of buses running on cleaner
fuels by 2000.

<DATELINE>HAMPTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who claimed he was beaten and
robbed while tending a Salvation Army Christmas kettle has admitted
he took the money and fabricated the story, authorities said.
   The 17-year-old took the money Dec. 4 and spent some of it on
taxi fare and a ticket to a rock concert two days later, police
said.
   ``It breaks your heart and kind of takes some of the spirit out
of Christmas,'' said Capt. Robert Hartsook, area manager for the
Salvation Army. ``It's theft any way you look at it.''
   Hartsook said the boy also spent some of the money on a coat.
   ``He did a stupid thing. All he had to do was call me and say,
`Hey, Captain, I need a coat.' I could have helped,'' Hartsook said.
   The boy admitted to fabricating the story when detectives
questioned him Thursday, police said. Detective Capt. R.E. Bingman
said charges are pending.
   The youngster's name was being withheld because he is a juvenile.
   Police said they received a tip from someone who said the boy
was seen exchanging a large number of coins for paper money.
   Hartsook said the boy apologized and agreed to make restitution,
but ``he'll never work for the Salvation Army again.''
   He also said he hoped the incident would not deter people from
donating to the organization's traditional Christmas fund-raising
drive.

<HEAD>AIDS Tests to be Done on NYC Autopsies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every autopsy at the New York City medical
examiner's office will include an AIDS test in an effort to inform
other people if they may be infected with the virus, according to a
published report today.
   The test results will be used in statistical research and in
``contact-tracing,'' the tracking of an AIDS sufferer's sexual
partners or drug-needle sharers, The New York Times said.
   Officials at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said
they were unaware of any other such program in the country.
   About 8,000 autopsies are performed every year by the medical
examiner's office. Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the chief medical
examiner, said he expected to detect the AIDS virus in about 1,000
of the autopsies.
   The testing has been approved by Mayor Edward I. Koch and was
authorized Monday by the medical examiner's advisory board.
   The results and the names of people who have been contacted will
be kept confidential.
   Hirsch said testing would begin by year's end after he discussed
the program with groups involved with AIDS issues.
   Some people have expressed concern that contact-tracing may lead
to invasion of privacy.
   But Stephen C. Joseph, the city's health commissioner, denied
that.
   ``What argument can anyone make to not warn the unsuspecting
partner of someone who is dead?'' he said. ``It's very compelling _
the absolute need to warn people at risk who might not learn any
other way.''
   He said the program will be useful in evaluating the extent of
the virus's spread in the city and be an ``extremely useful tool
for epidemiologic control and prevention.''
   There are 75,000 deaths every year in New York City. Autopsies
are carried out for unusual or unexplained deaths, and are required
in homicides, suicides and deaths from drug overdose.
   Many of those who die for unexplained reasons are believed to
carry the AIDS virus, particularly intravenous drug users.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Congress briefly halted work on
reforming the economy today to pay tribute to Andrei D. Sakharov,
the colleague who was the ruling Communist Party's most severe
critic.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the 2,250 members of the
Congress of People's Deputies stood for a moment of silence to
remember the scientist whose challenge to the Kremlin's human
rights policies led to nearly seven years of internal exile.
   The 68-year-old physicist, who died Thursday night in his Moscow
apartment, was the ``people's conscience,'' said Boris N. Yeltsin,
the maverick deputy who along with Sakharov was a leader of a group
considering whether to form an alternative political party.
   ``All honest people in the U.S.S.R. and throughout the world
will grieve for him,'' Yeltsin said.
   At the time of his death, the Nobel Peace Prize winner was
preparing a speech he was to give to Congress demanding that the
Communists' constitutional guarantee on power be revoked, a move
made by Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary in recent weeks.
   In other developments in Eastern Europe:
   _ East Germany has established its first contacts with the
International Monetary Fund. West Germany's foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, says in an interview published today that
``closer ties between the two German states contribute to stability
in Europe.''
   _ In Sofia, Bulgaria, up to 50,000 people jeered and whistled
Thursday outside that hall where Parliement delayed legally
repealing the Communist monopoly on power.
   _ Elsewhere, NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels today
endorsed a plan to allow unarmed military jets from Eastern bloc
countries to fly over their territory as part of efforts to further
reduce East-West military tensions.
   Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a member of the Presidium of the Congress,
opened today's session by announcing the death of Sakharov, who won
the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights work. Vorotnikov
paid tribute to Sakharov both as a scientist and public figure.
   ``All that he did was dictated by his sleepless conscience, his
deep humanitarian convictions,'' said Vorotnikov, a member of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo and president of the Russian
Federation.
   Dmitri Likhachev, another scholar-deputy, told the chamber,
``With Sakharov, a part of our heart has departed from us. We could
agree or disagree with him, but he was a man of absolute sincerity
and absolute purity, and this led him to achievements in sicence
and his position in public life.''
   The course of Sakharov's independent group of delegates, the
400-member Inter-Regional Deputies Group, was unclear.
   A strike that Sakharov tried to organize Monday had fizzled, and
deputies outvoted the independents to cut off debate on possibly
changing an article of the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed the
Communist Party's role as the leading force in society.
   Sakharov and historian Yuri Afanasyev said in an emotional
three-hour meeting Thursday that it was time to call for a
multiparty democratic system. Sakharov said Thursday that Gorbachev
and the Communist Party leadership were ``leading the country to
catastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years.''
   Thursday's meeting came as the Congress began dissecting the
government's blueprint for economic reform, with progressives
complaining that it was not daring enough to improve the country's
grim financial condition.
   Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov announced Wednesday that the Kremlin
believes it can revive the economy without resorting to such
radical moves as legalization of private property and selling off
money-losing state enterprises.
   Progressives in Congress reacted with scorn to Ryzhkov's speech,
which promised five more years of bureaucratic control of such

   The government proposal does shift the emphasis of traditional
central planning away from heavy industry to consumer goods and
services. Such enterprises are to quadruple in the next five-year
plan, from 1991-1996.

   The House Banking Committee chairman says he
will begin an effort to reform the Federal Reserve Board, saying
the ``splendid isolation'' of the central bank ``won't continue
forever.''
   ``I recognize the need to give the Federal Reserve room to
operate and make objective judgments,'' Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, a longtime critic of the Fed, said Thursday.
   ``But, this doesn't have to mean ... (it) operates as some
separate government, free to veto economic policy spelled out by
the administration, the Congress _ and the American people at the
voting booths.''
   On another matter, Gonzalez prodded President Bush to
re-evaluate the administration's ``Pollyannaish'' view that a $50
billion savings and loan bailout is sufficient.
   Bush suggested earlier this week that the $50 billion the
government is borrowing to close S&amp;Ls through September 1991 may
fall short. However, a day later, his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater,
backtracked, saying the president had no plans to ask Congress for
more money.

<NOTE>College Presidents Urged to Back NCAA Disclosure Plan</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidents of colleges and universities with
NCAA programs are being urged to support a proposal requiring
disclosure of graduation rates among athletes as an alternative to
a government-mandated program.
   ``Federal intrusion in this area would set a very dangerous
precedent and would open a door that we will never be able to close
again,'' James Whalen, chairman of the American Council on
Education board of directors, said Thursday.
   Whalen said that if the proposal is not approved at the NCAA
annual meeting Jan. 7-9, ``the Congress of the United States will
do it for us.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., are
sponsoring legislation that would require colleges to disclose how
many of their athletes graduate.
   Bradley and McMillen, both former professional basketball
players, contend the legislation would improve education standards
for college athletes and provide students and their parents with
valuable information about the school they plan to attend.
   Whalen, president of New York's Ithaca College, said the
proposal has little chance of passing unless the majority of the
presidents attend the meeting. Many presidents have traditionally
sent a representative, such as the athletic director.

<NOTE>Accord Reached on $15.2 Billion in Loans for Poorest Countries</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and 31 other governments
have agreed on $15.2 billion worth of easy loans for more than 50
of the world's poorest countries over a three-year period.
   ``Ninety percent of the money will go to countries where the
average annual income is $400 a year or less,'' said World Bank
President Barber B. Conable on Thursday.
   The money will come from the 32 countries with the United States
furnishing the largest share. The total U.S. contribution was put
at $3.18 billion by George A. Folsum, deputy assistant secretary of
the treasury for developing nations.
   Conable said he expects President Bush to ask Congress for the
first $1.08 billion in his next budget, early in the new year. The
overall package of loan money will be available starting next July
1.
   For the previous three years, the United States made the same
contribution.
   The new money will be lent out by the bank's International
Development Association for as long as 40 years, at only nominal
interest. With repayments made on loans from earlier years, the
bank expects to have to have about $5.5 billion a year for this
type of loan, Conable said.
   Japan's contribution will be a close second: $3.05 billion at
the exchange rate Folsum used, up from $2.76 billion for the
previous three years.

<NOTE>Wetlands Agreement Between EPA and Corps of Engineers May Be</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An EPA spokeswoman says a planned agreement
between the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of
Engineers aimed at carrying out President Bush's campaign pledge to
preserve wetlands may be put on hold for 30 days.
   The memorandum of agreement, which was scheduled to take effect
today, has sparked an intense struggle within the administration.
The departments of Energy and Transportation oppose it and the
Council on Environmental Quality and the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration favor it.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
said the Interior Department has split, with the Fish and Wildlife
Service favoring immediate implementation and the Minerals
Management Service opposed.
   Environmentalists are keeping a close watch on the dispute,
which has been growing since EPA and the Corps initialled the new
agreement early last month.
   ``I think this is a real litmus test of Bush's commitment to
wetlands protection,'' said Jan Goldman-Carter, counsel to the
National Wildlife
   In last year's presidential campaign, Bush endorsed a policy of
``No net loss'' of wetlands like swamps, bogs, fens, marshes and
tidal estuaries, often craved for residential, commercial and
agricultural development. The goal emerged from recommendations of
the Conservation Foundation, whose then head, William Reilly, was
appointed EPA administrator by Bush.
   In recent years, environmentalists have come to recognize the
value of these areas for wildlife habitat, purification of polluted
waterways, flood control and other purposes.

<HEAD>Robert Morse Plays Truman Capote on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs with other critics' reviews. No pickup. No PMs
planned.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Underneath all the celebrity, writer Truman
Capote was a melancholy, lonely little man.
   That's one of the points playwright Jay Presson Allen makes with
surprising poignancy in ``Tru,'' her terrific one-man show based on
the life of the well-known literary personality.
   The play, which opened Thursday night at Broadway's Booth
Theater, examines a specific, highly publicized life, but its
lessons are universal. Allen takes the man and makes his plight
moving. Capote, defeated by too much high and low life, becomes the
victim of his success. Or rather the success he has can't
compensate for the rejection he feels from family, friends, lovers
and a fickle public.
   In the play, the pudgy, pint-sized Capote prowls his plush
apartment at United Nations Plaza. He tattles on the telephone in
search of ``a dirt fix,'' talks into a tape recorder for a
biographer and eventually ends up speaking directly to the audience
about his strange, unhappy life.
   The show takes place in the week before Christmas 1975. It's a
momentous time for Capote, just after Esquire magazine published an
excerpt from his novel-in-progress ``Answered Prayers.'' In it,
Capote savages some of his rich, female friends, such people as
Babe Paley and Lady Nancy Keith. Much to his surprise and anger,
they cut him off. ``You'd think I killed the Lindbergh baby,'' he
whines.
   Capote proclaims himself an artist, and a true artist has no
friends, he says. But the man still craves the acceptance of these
people. Their abandonment hurts him just as much as when his own
mother left him as a child with her sisters in Alabama.
   There are some sweet remembrances of that time, including a
reading from ``A Christmas Memory,'' a heart-breaking holiday story
about his childhood and his favorite aunt.
   Capote is played with astonishing fidelity by Robert Morse. The
actor, best known as a brash musical comedy performer, is a
revelation, and not only because of Kevin Haney's remarkable makeup
which transforms him into a credible likeness of Capote.
   His Capote is wickedly funny, a sly imp ready to deliver an
off-color joke about the Queen Mum, zing Robert Goulet or
rhapsodize about the time he tap-danced for Louis Armstrong. His
voice is soft and sibilant, his body language languid, except when
he dives into a dance, bopping to ``The Girl From Ipanema.''
   But there's a desperate side to Capote, too, and Morse rises to
the pain. The playwright conjures up a devastating moment in Act 2
when Capote puts his fist through a portrait of himself as a young
man, a beautiful golden boy who let his life fall apart. It earns
gasps from the audience.
   Allen deftly weaves biographical facts into the evening,
refusing to present Capote as merely a case study. The production,
which the playwright also directed, rarely falters as it builds to
the loneliest of Christmas Eves.
   The luxurious apartment designed by David Mitchell offers an
appropriately panoramic view of the East River and the gaudy
furnishings include Capote's own sofa lent by Joanne Carson.
   It's an opulent, colorful setting, the perfect environment for
Allen's extravagant, colorful subject. But Capote, who died in
1984, probably would have been interesting wherever he was and so
is the play. ``Tru'' is an affecting portrait of a gifted but
peculiar writer, whose saddest story turned out to be his own.
   Broadway critics praised Morse in the one-man show. They also
applauded Allen but wished that he had delved deeper into Capote's
persona.
   Clive Barnes in the New York Post called Morse's performance a
tour de force and said that with the Allen's help, Capote ``really
does live again.''
   The Daily News' Howard Kissel said Allen ``captures both
(Capote's) wit and malice beautifully,'' and that Morse's work is
``sheer joy.''
   ``It is a shock, not to mention a pleasure and delight, to
stumble on Capote's ghost in the unlikely person of Robert Morse,''
said Linda Winer in today's New York Newsday. But she said Allen
unfortunately does not touch the mysteries of what made Capote a
great writer, when he was up to it.
   Frank Rich of The New York Times, wishing for a stronger play,
said ``in place of a life portrait with depth, `Tru' settles for
its wind-up Madame Tussauds's caricature of the wrecked 1975 model
Capote.'' And while applauding Morse's efforts, he said his
performances leaves one eager to see him in other works.

   A Hollywood producer charged with soliciting
children for sex fled from a courthouse after learning he was about
to be arrested on a second, similar complaint, his lawyer said.
   A judge revoked David MacLeod's $6,000 bail and issued a warrant
for his arrest after he disappeared Thursday.
   ``I'm waiting for a call when he comes to his senses. This isn't
a guy to be a fugitive,'' MacLeod's lawyer, Barry Asness, said
later Thursday. He said MacLeod apparently panicked at the thought
of being returned to jail.
   MacLeod, 45, who produced ``The Pick-Up Artist'' in 1987 and was
an associate producer of ``Ishtar'' the same year, was arrested
Dec. 8 on charges of criminal solicitation and endangering
children. Police alleged he had been cruising housing projects in
the Bronx and Brooklyn boroughs of New York, offering boys money
for sex.
   He appeared at state Supreme Court in the Bronx with his lawyer
Thursday for a routine hearing. But he learned that police from the
Queens borough were there to arrest him on similar charges. Before
his case was called, MacLeod said he was going out to make a
telephone call and never returned, Asness said.
   MacLeod had been held for three days after his last arrest
because of processing delays in the overloaded jail system, and was
harassed by other prisoners because of the nature of the charges
against him, Asness said.
   ``For three days this guy was in hell,'' he said. ``He feared
that again.''

<HEAD>East German Leader Asks U.S. to Help Keep Germanys Separate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new leader of East Germany's Communist Party
said the United States should work to keep the two Germanys
separate in the interests of Europe's stability, The New York Times
reported today.
   Gregor Gysi, chairman of the once-dominant party, said in an
interview Thursday that if East Germany were united with the more
powerful West Germany, his country would become ``the poorhouse''
of the new country.
   But if unification is to happen, he said, ``It should happen
quickly _ and simply.''
   Gysi, a 41-year-old lawyer, was elected Communist Party chairman
Saturday. The party relinquished its monopoly on power last month.
   Gysi told the Times the United States should not give up its
responsibilities in Europe.
   ``If the continued independence of the German Democratic
Republic is in the interests of stability in Europe, then you
should think about whether you want to leave help for the GDR up to
a single neighbor country, and thereby create dependency, or
whether it wouldn't be better to share the responsibility, to
prevent the re-emergence of greater Germany,'' he said.
   Gysi said the absorption of East Germany into what he described
as greater Germany would create a dangerous economic imbalance in
Western Europe and lead to right-wing nationalistic fervor. He said
that frenzy could lead to demands that borders established after
World War II be realigned to include former German territories now
in Poland.
   ``I am utterly against a special German solution before such a
process of European unification is completed,'' Gysi said.

<HEAD>`Popeye' Theme Creator Sammy Lerner Dead at 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sammy Lerner, the Hollywood songwriter whose
lyrics ``I'm strong to the finich 'cause I eats me spinach''
created a loyal following for Popeye the Sailor Man, has died of
cancer. He was 86.
   Lerner died Wednesday at a Los Angeles nursing home, said a
spokeswoman for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   The serious songwriter said he was horrified by the 1932 theme
``I'm Popeye the Sailor Man,'' which he composed in less than two
hours for cartoonist Dave Fleischer.
   ``When I saw that first cartoon, I wanted to crawl in a
corner,'' Lerner said in a 1977 interview. ```Just do me a favor,'
I said. `Don't put my name on the screen.'''
   Lerner was as adept at nonsense cartoon lyrics as he was with
the romantic and breezy standards of Tin Pan Alley.
   His work in the 1930s and 1940s included ``Is It True What They
Say About Dixie,'' a song immortalized by Al Jolson, and English
lyrics to ``Falling in Love Again,'' Marlene Dietrich's song in the
film, ``The Blue Angel.''
   Lerner also wrote the theme for Betty Boop and a number of
``bouncing ball'' musical cartoon songs.
   Born in Saveni, Romania, in 1903, Lerner emigrated with his
family to Detroit, where he attended Wayne State University.
   He began writing songs for vaudeville acts and lyrics for the
Ziegfeld Follies stage shows in New York. Soon he was composing
lyrics for cartoons in Hollywood and songs for film musicals,
including ``Blondie Meets the Boss,'' ``The Lady Vanishes'' and
``Lady From Cheyenne.''
   He collaborated with such popular composers as Hoagy Carmichael,
Richard Whiting, Gerald Marks, Irving Caesar and Burton Lane.
   Lerner is survived by his wife of 53 years, Dorothy.

<TEXT>
   French troops landed today on the Comoros Islands,
taking control of the country's security in what the Defense
Ministry called a military mission requested by the Comoros
government.
   Four hours later, French mercenary Bob Denard and about 25 other
European soldiers of fortune who trained and led the 600-member
Comoran Presidential Guard boarded a South African military plane
and left for South Africa, Agence France-Presse reported. No
violence was reported during the French operation.
   The French government said earlier that the mercenaries had
offered to relinquish control of the country, but it was unclear
whether an agreement was reached and if so, what terms were offered.
   A military spokesman said the soldiers came from the French
Indian Ocean island of Mayotte, 185 miles away, under a ``defense
cooperation agreement between France and the Comoros.'' France once
controlled the Comoros Islands.
   Both President Francois Mitterrand and Defense Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement had stressed earlier this week that there
would be no French military intervention in the Comoros.
   The islands off southeast African have been in turmoil since the
Nov. 26 assassination of President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane.
   AFP, the French news agency, said from Comoran capital, Moroni,
that 50 French paratroopers in helicopters landed to take over
control of the archipelago from the Presidential Guard. They were
followed by two transport planes full of troops.
   Denard and the Presidential Guard had been in control of the
islands since the president's assassination.
   At one end of the runway, 250 men of the Presidential Guard
stood at attention along with Denard dressed in civilian clothes,
awaiting the change of control, AFP reported.
   About 25 of the French troops, accompanied by the French
military attache in Moroni, approached Denard and his men and,
after a brief conversation, the chief mercenary left the area, AFP
said.
   On Thursday, AFP said Denard was willing to relinquish control
if the safety of his men was guaranteed and if he and his fellow
mercenaries were given an unspecified payment. It was unclear if
those demands were honored.
   The Johannesburg Star said South African officials planned to
issue Denard a temporary residence permit on condition he agreed to
leave within a month.
   Most Comorans believe Denard and his mercenaries, who first put
Abdallah into power in 1978, were responsible for his death. Denard
has denied killing the president, but he admitted during a news
conference that he was in the room when the shooting occurred.
   Denard, a veteran soldier of fortune in several Asian and
African conflicts, claimed that Abdallah was shot accidentally by a
bodyguard.
   Six French and Belgian mercenaries left Moroni on Thursday night
on the Air France flight for Paris, accompanied by wives and other
family members, AFP reported. They rest left today, the agency said.
   The intervention by the French, the former colonial power, ``a
matter of an express request by the Comoran authorities,'' said the
Defense Ministry in Paris. ``It is a takeover from the Presidential
Guard.''
   Both France and South Africa, the biggest aid suppliers to the
Comoros, had cut off assistance and were putting strong pressure on
Denard and his men to leave. Negotiations had been going on for the
past several days.

   A judge who was barraged with phone calls when
the Christian Broadcasting Network telecast her office phone number
nationwide said it will not help reduce the sentence she gave the
deputy director of Operation Rescue.
   Fulton County State Court Judge Thelma Wyatt Cummings had
sentenced Michael McMonagle to six months in jail after he refused
to pay a $1,000 fine after being convicted of obstructing a public
sidewalk during an abortion protest.
   ``If you believe that harassing telephone calls and harassing
letters with pictures of dead babies will cause me to modify your
sentence, you are mistaken,'' she told McMonagle Thursday.
   ``I believe that if you file a proper motion for modification, I
will consider it in proper fashion,'' the judge said. ``This is
having the opposite effect to what I believe you desire.''
   CBN reporter Ty Bragg presented a feature on the trials of
opponents of legalized abortion in Atlanta on Thursday morning's
``700 Club'' show. He supplied Cummings' number and encouraged
viewers to call and complain about the sentence given McMonagle.
   The judge said her secretary reported that calls were coming in
at the rate of one per minute.
   Cummings also was upset by a statement in Bragg's report that a
child pornographer had received a lighter sentence than McMonagle.
   ``I have not had a child pornography case in my 12 years on the
bench,'' Cummings said.
   Frankie Abourjilie, vice president of public relations for the
Virginia Beach, Va.-based CBN, said McMonagle had no control over
the show.
   McMonagle represented himself on a charge of obstructing a
public sidewalk or passageway during a November trial. The charge
stemmed from a demonstration in October 1988 at the Feminist
Women's Health Center. McMonagle was directing protesters with a
bullhorn when he was arrested.

<HEAD>East Germany To Disband Communist Party Militia</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 14 grafs to UPDATE with announcement that party militia
will be disbanded. Pickup 9th pvs, `ADN called...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   In another concession to pro-democracy
groups, East Germany said today it will disband the Communist Party
militia, further weakening the party's grip on power.
   The announcement came a day after the government abolished the
hated secret police, often used to suppress any signs of dissent.
   Pro-democracy activists had demanded the breakup of both the
militia and the secret police as the country moves toward free
elections in May.
   The militia, once armed with anti-aircraft guns, automatic
weapons, armored personnel carriers and rocket-propelled grenades,
acted as the Communist Party's own army.
   In a brief dispatch, the state ADN news agency said Communist
Premier Hans Modrow's government had agreed on an ``end to the work
of the militia,'' which it said would be completed by the end of
June 1990.
   According to Western estimates, the militia numbers 3,000 active
members, but it is believed that 400,000 could be called up on
short notice.
   The government already has begun disarming the militia, which
was put on alert to help crush the pro-democracy protests in
October. There were some reports that the militia had been put into
action then.
   East Germany's Communists have made increasing concessions to
the opposition since hard-line leader Erich Honecker's ouster on
Oct. 18. The leadership has promised to separate government and
Communist Party functions.
   The Communist nation has also established its first contacts
with the International Monetary Fund as it breaks with the
isolation of the past.
   On Thursday, the leadership welcomed wide-ranging economic
cooperation with West Germany, and earlier this week it expressed
interest in closer ties with the United States.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, in an
interview published today, said that ``closer ties between the two
German states contribute to stability in Europe.''
   Genscher also said that East Germans will have a chance to
decide between a socialist or free-market system in elections
planned in the spring, and ``we will respect'' their decision,
according to the newspaper Der Morgen.
   ``We remain a single nation,'' the Genscher said. He envisaged
the two German states growing together within a general process of
overcoming the postwar division of Europe and a ``demilitarization
of East-West relations.''
   Late Thursday, ADN said East German envoy Peter Dietze met with
Helen B. Junz, the International Monetary Fund's special trade
representative.
   ADN called Thursday's session in Geneva the ``first contacts''
between the two sides, saying Dietze had expressed interest in the
``economic, monetary, political and financial experience'' of the
IMF.
   ``The contacts are expected to be continued,'' said ADN. But it
did not say whether East Germany will seek membership in the
international organization.
   A day earlier, Poland said it and the IMF had agreed on a
package of economic reforms and credit that is expected to
stimulate a flow of Western support for the East European nation.
   The IMF, with headquarters in Washington, promotes monetary
cooperation, currency stabilization and trade expansion.
   In Brussels, the European Economic Community named East Germany
as one of the Eastern European countries that could qualify for
Western financial aid, if East Berlin seeks to adopt free-market
principles.
   East Germany has been showing greater interest in developing its
foreign trade, as demonstrated by the visit of West German
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann. Haussmann met with Communist
Premier Hans Modrow, and the two sides agreed to set up a joint
economic commission and broaden cooperation.
   East Germany is seeking to attract more Western capital, while
there are numerous signs of change on the diplomatic level as well.
   After meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Tuesday, Modrow said that he looked forward to broader scientific
and cultural ties with the United States, in addition to more
economic links.
   Baker is the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit East Germany
in nearly two decades. The sides established diplomatic relations
in 1974.
   Modrow said he saw clear signs of U.S. support for the current
democratic and economic reform process under way in East Germany.
   All of the openings amount to a virtual revolution for East
Germany, which as late as August was defending the Berlin Wall as
an ``anti-fascist protection wall'' against plundering from an
allegedly greedy West.

   A foul-mouthed 11-year-old girl carrying a
beeper was arrested trying to sell crack, police said.
   ``As soon as she opened her mouth ... she called us every name
in the book,'' said Port Authority Police Officer William Smith.
   The girl ``looked like any 11-year-old girl, baby-faced, wearing
sneakers,'' he said. But she allegedly carried 20 vials of crack
and a pager when she was cught Wednesday morning at a bustling
midtown shopping spot, Smith said.
   She was charged as a juvenile with felony possession and her
case was referred to Family Court, authorities said. The child was
taken to Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx because it could not
be determined where she lived.
   ``She's one street-smart lady,'' Smith said. ``It's sad. She's
the youngest person I've ever arrested.''
   Police said the girl apparently learned the trade from her
mother, who was arrested in the same location in August 1988,
carrying 426 vials of crack.

   Scotland's chief law officer today
announced the first public inquiry into the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, which exploded over Scotland and killed 270 people.
   Lord Fraser, the Lord Advocate, said criminal prosecution was
not imminent but that he still hoped to find the terrorists who
planted the bomb in a suitcase that brought down the flight on Dec.
21, 1988.
   The Boeing 747, packed with Christmas travelers heading to New
York from Frankfurt and London, exploded over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
   Investigators displayed pictures at a news conference today
showing how they had reconstructed the part of the plane where the
explosion occurred, with a gaping hole in the forward cargo section.
   The Department of Transport said aircraft often are
reconstructed but that this represented ``quite an achievement''
because it involved many small pieces scattered over a large area.
Police had said earlier they had recovered 85 percent of the
aircraft.
   In a statement released at the news conference, Fraser said the
fatal accident inquiry _ similar to a coroner's inquest _ will be
held next year but that a date and place had not been set.
   The inquiry's scope will include whether ``reasonable
precautions'' might have avoided the tragedy and possible
``defects'' in any system that might have contributed to the
deaths, Fraser said.
   He said the announcment was made today to give authorities time
to organize the inquiry and notify people, and that it had nothing
to do with the first anniversary of the crash next week.
   Fatal accident inquiries are conducted by a sheriff sitting
without a jury. The sheriff will issue a finding on the evidence.
   Fraser said the inquiry would have power under Scottish law to
order foreign evidence, although it could not request people
overseas to appear. Relatives of the victims are entitled to attend
or be represented.
   Investigators remain determined ``to bring the evil perpetrators
of this mass murder to justice,'' Fraser said. ``This appalling
terrorist outrage ... was an affront ... to civilized people
everywhere.''
   There are two investigations already under way in Britain, the
criminal probe headed by the Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and
a crash probe by the Department of Transport's Air Accident
Investigation branch. Neither of those investigations are being
held in public.
   George Esson, chief of the constabulary, said his investigation
had focused on the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, or PFLP-GC, an extremist Palestinian
group headed by Ahmed Jibril.
   ``It would be right to say that we have focused our attention on
one group, but it would be unwise to rule out other
possibilities,'' he said.
   Asked whether that group was the PFLP-GC, he said: ``Certainly.''
   Investigators have said a bomb made of plastic explosive was
packed in a Toshiba radio-cassette player and hidden in a suitcase,
which was loaded into a forward cargo hold. They displayed a photo
today showing the reconstructed metal container which held the
suitcase bomb.
   Esson said Scottish investigators still believe the suitcase
bomb ``either started or passed through the Frankfurt airport,''
where the flight originated. West German police maintain there is
not enough evidence to prove that.
   Fraser and Esson were asked about Mohammad Abu Talb, a member of
another radical Palestinian group who is charged in Sweden with
four bombings in northern Europe. He was identified in a Swedish
court as a suspect in the Lockerbie bombing and police seized
clothing from his home, reportedly to compare with shreds of
clothing found in the wreckage.
   ``I have at present no intention to seek the extradition of Abu
Talb,'' Fraser said.
   Esson said: ``He is certainly an individual in whom we have an
interest.'' He added that investigators wanted to talk with many
people, but he refused to identify them further.
   Fraser, asked about the contents of the baggage that contained
the bomb, said investigators also had found ``items of clothing
which have been further identified and located.'' He refused to
elaborate.
   Fraser denied that he was pessimistic about prosecutions and
said investigators had made ``impressive'' progress aided by
outstanding forensic work and unprecedented international
cooperation.
   ``What we are doing in effect is trying to piece together an
international terrorist jigsaw,'' Esson said. ``We have some of the
pieces, some we are trying to place, and some we have yet to find.''

<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov, the brilliant physicist who
built the Soviet hydrogen bomb and became an unwavering beacon for
the world in the cause of human rights, has died at age 68.
   The 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner died alone in his study
Thursday night of an apparent heart attack, said his son-in-law,
Yefrem Yankelevich. Sakharov died as he had lived the last two
decades of his life, struggling for democracy, world peace and
human liberty.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who freed Sakharov from nearly
seven years of internal exile but clashed with him repeatedly over
the scale and speed of new Soviet political reforms, mourned the
death as ``a great loss.''
   ``He was a man of conviction and sincerity,'' Gorbachev said.
``He was not some sort of political intriguer. He was a person who
had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly
and directly. This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on many
things we did agree.''
   Sakharov risked his status as a national scientific hero and the
honors the Soviet Union had heaped upon him to openly challenge the
government when most others were silent. He was vilified, attacked
by the authorities and banished from Moscow in 1980. The exile
sapped his vitality and undermined his health.
   After he was freed by Gorbachev three years ago, he won a seat
in the Soviet Congress. He used it as a forum to press for reform
and freedom in his country, gaining new stature as a conscience of
the nation.
   Tributes to the brave humanist came from around the world.
   Sakharov's death occurred after a long day of struggle to
organize an opposition to the Communist Party. He was preparing a
speech demanding that the Communists' guaranteed hold on power be
revoked, Yankelevich said.
   The defiant activist's final words to his family were:
``Tomorrow there will be battle,'' Yankelevich said.
   Sergei Kovalev, a fellow human rights activist in Moscow and a
friend, said the body was found by Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner.
Bonner was his full partner in their human rights campaigns that
embraced any cause, fought any injustice and gave strength and
courage to victims and to those who wanted to reform the Soviet
Union.
   Bonner, his strength and his companion during the years of
struggle and exile, sat in a chair next to the body. A few close
friends were admitted to the apartment, said a friend who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   Just hours before he died, Sakharov stood on the floor of the
Congress of People's Deputies and demanded that opposition
delegates form an alternative party to the Communists.
   He told his fellow opposition congressmen that Gorbachev and the
Communist Party leadership were ``leading the country to
catastrophe, prolonging the process of perestroika many years.''
   It was the latest call in his final cause: to end seven decades
of guaranteed Communist supremacy.
   The 2,250-seat Congress formed a committee to organize
Sakharov's funeral, and Gorbachev said he and the entire body will
attend. At his own request, Sakharov will be buried alongside his
parents Monday at Vostryakovskoe Cemetery on the southwestern edge
of Moscow, said a scientific secretary at the Lebedev Physics
Institute where Sakharov worked.
   Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a member of the Presidium of the Congress,
opened today's session with an announcement of the death of one of
the chamber's best-known deputies, a man who was officially
vilified for decades.
   He paid tribute to Sakharov both as a scientist and public
figure.
   ``All that he did was dictated by his sleepless conscience, his
deep humanitarian convictions,'' said Vorotnikov, a member of the
Communist Party Politburo and president of the Russian Federation.
   Gorbachev joined the Congress in standing for a moment of
silence out of respect for the Congress member.
   Dmitri Likhachev, another scholar-deputy, told the chamber:
``With Sakharov, a part of our heart has departed from us.''
   Yankelevich told reporters at the apartment that his
father-in-law ``died last night of what the doctors say was a heart
attack. We don't exactly know the cause of death yet.''
   Yankelevich said Sakharov had left his apartment about 9 p.m. to
go downstairs to another apartment in the same building, where he
had a study crammed with books and papers from his scientific and
political careers.

   Sakharov had suffered from angina, but during a visit to the
United States in December 1988, doctors at Massachusetts General
Hospital determined he did not need heart surgery or a pacemaker
after cardiovascular tests.
   He had aged visibly in recent months, which were busy with
international speaking trips and his work as a member of the new,
competitively elected Congress.
   A White House statement today hailed Sakharov as a historic
figure whose voice ``was an important dimension in the contemporary
changes under way in Soviet society.''
   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in
Soviet labor camps before immigrating to Israel in 1986, told
Israel radio today that Sakharov ``had tremendous influence ...
among dissidents, among free people in the Soviet Union and who by
his own personal example helped change the whole climate in the
Soviet Union.''
   In Strasbourg, France, the European Parliament unanimously paid
tribute today to Sakharov, whose name it had given to its Human
Rights Prize.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, attending a NATO summit
in Brussels, Belgium, said: ``He was a tremendous force for peace
and freedom.''
   The Congress formed a committee to organize Sakharov's funeral,
the official Tass news agency said. It was a reflection of
Sakharov's trek from his years as a lonely voice opposed to Kremlin
policies to again becoming a honored member of society.
   Born May 21, 1921, Sakharov's first became known as a great
scientist, inducted into the Academy of Sciences in 1953 at age 32,
the youngest-ever member. Like his father, he became a physicist.
   In 1948, he joined physicist Igor Tamm in developing the
hydrogen bomb and for 20 years lived and worked in secrecy, with
privileges that included a good apartment, driver, high salary and
government awards. But Sakharov began to worry about the morality
of developing weapons of mass destruction.
   He had his first brush with top Soviet officials in 1961, when
he appealed to Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev to stop nuclear weapons
tests. Khrushchev responded that scientists shouldn't meddle in
politics. Two years later, the Soviet Union agreed to such limits
in a treaty with the United States.
   After Sakharov formed the Human Rights Committee in 1970, he
became better known as a dissident leader, clashing with four
Kremlin leaderships over human rights, foreign policy and the
morality of the nuclear weaponry he helped create.
   As an emerging dissident, Sakharov appeared to be immune to
official sanctions while other prominent dissidents were forced to
emigrate or sent to labor camps. But in 1973, Sakharov was warned
by authorities that his interviews and statements were used by the
foreign press for anti-Soviet slander and that he should be aware
of the consequences.
   Sakharov continued to speak out, and he and his wife attended
the trials of prominent dissidents and lent their names to
international appeals for prisoners of conscience in all countries
to be freed.
   The physicist's tireless campaigns on behalf of disarmament and
human rights won him the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, and he steadfastly
argued that without international respect for human rights there
could be no guarantee of peace.
   He was stripped of his Soviet awards after he criticized the
1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and then-Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev banished him in January 1980 to Gorky, 200 miles east of
Moscow.
   Sakharov was never charged with any crime or put on trial.
   Reporters, foreign visitors and diplomats who knew Sakharov
described him as a modest man of patience and humor but determined
once his ire was aroused.
   He was released in December 1986 and recalled to Moscow by
Gorbachev.
   He swiftly took a leading role in urging the Soviet leader to
follow through on Gorbachev's twin policies of perestroika, or
restructuring, and glasnost, or openness.
   He was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies this year,
completing a remarkable comeback. In June, he told the Soviet
Congress he had no regrets. ``I am proud of this exile in Gorky
like a medal I wear.''

<TEXT>
   The crumbling of communist rule in Eastern
Europe is prompting some to proclaim that history, at least in
terms of ideological struggle, is over and the championship belt
goes to democratic capitalism.
   Not so fast, say dissenters on the left. History is not over by
a long shot. Don't count Marxism out just yet.
   In the United States, longtime U.S. Communist Party leader Gus
Hall yearns for the good old days when the Soviet Union was less
inclined toward revisionist thought.
   Hall was so incensed at the irreverent views of a leading Soviet
reform organ, Moscow News, that he urged his allies in the
birthplace of Lenin to have the editor removed.
   Otherwise, said Hall, they could ``burn down the god-damn
building. I mean get rid of it.'' As Hall sees it, the interests of
class struggle preclude capitalism's right to exist. Hall also had
no patience with pro-democracy demonstrators in China, finding them
entirely too pro-American.
   Hall's views may seem increasingly quaint in a world where
Marxists increasingly are on the defensive, but the far left does
not give up easily.
   In this hemisphere, Cuban President Fidel Castro still boasts a
devout following among some of his countrymen and the leftist cause
continues to persuade many in Nicaragua and El Salvador to take up
arms.
   Don't tell the Salvadoran rebels that democratic capitalists are
on the side of history. They see around them all the evils that
Karl Marx spoke of: exploitation, class stratification, disease,
unemployment and illiteracy.
   To these combatants, there is considerable allure to a
philosophy _ socialism _ which ``guarantees'' equality and the
right to health care, education and employment.
   The Salvadoran militants don't want to hear about the hundreds
of thousands who have been demonstrating in Prague for the past two
months demanding an end to 40 years of misrule.
   They want an end to more than a century and a half of misrule in
their own country. Obviously there are many in El Salvador who
believe that a rebel-led government would only make things worse.
   And don't tell the hard-liners within Nicaragua's leadership
about the wonders of democratic capitalism. Most of Latin America
has lived under elected civilian governments for the past decade, a
period marked by one of the steepest economic declines in the
region's history.
   The Sandinistas blame the armed uprising Washington has been
supporting for almost a decade for their inability to improve the
lot of their citizens.
   Perhaps the most irrepressible defender of the Marxist faith
these days is Castro, who believes someone must stand up for the
``thousands of millions of people in the world who live in inhuman
conditions.''
   Castro blames this state of affairs on the ``colossal looting''
of imperialist countries, led by the United States.
   Don't talk to Castro about the more than 200,000 East Germans
who have fled to West Germany this year. He'd rather talk about the
40,000 children who die each day around the world _ a Hiroshima and
a Nagasaki, as he puts it, every three days.
   Standing before a gathering of his countrymen last week, Castro
warned of the dangers of reverting to capitalist rule:
``prostitution, drugs, gambling, begging, unemployment, abysmal
inequality between citizens ... ''
   He believes communism is too young a philosophy to give up on,
especially when one considers the alternative. This notion, of
course, is being rejected by millions of East Europeans who believe
it is farfetched to suggest the flaws of Marxism can be corrected,
as Castro suggests, with mere fine tuning.

   It was a case in which the judge had to
read the jury its rights _ rights to the $1,000 prize from a
lottery ticket that came with lunch.
   The panel, deliberating in a product liability case, wasn't sure
if it could keep the cash because the government paid for the
lunch. So jurors asked U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb, who was
presiding over the trial.
   Bailiff Sandy Bowe said Crabb laughed and said to instruct the
jury that nothing could be done with the ticket until they decided
the case being tried.
   The lunches, which Bowe picked up at a delicatessan, included
four ``Instant Cash Match'' tickets as a promotion, and when a
juror scratched the tickets, one was a $1,000 winner.
   The eight jurors asked to split the prize and on Wednesday,
after the case was settled, the judge agreed.
   She said she relied on the motion picture ``Miracle on 34th
Street'' and Christmas spirit for precedent.
   ``The bailiff gave the jury four unnegotiated tickets which in
that state had a negligible value,'' the judge wrote in a decision
that had the density if not the weight of an actual judicial ruling.
   ``Since there was nothing improper about giving uncashed tickets
of trivial value to the jury, there is no basis for either the
bailiff or the government to try to reassert ownership of the
tickets or their proceeds.
   ``We need not decide which of the jurors has any greater claim
to the prize ticket over any of the others. In the best spirit of a
jury, the jurors have agreed to share equally in any prize money to
which they may be entitled.''

   Someone has given Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby a
pounding headache by walking off with the wooden gavel he used
during a recent special session of the Texas Legislature.
   ``Who would have ever thought someone would take the gavel?''
Saralee Tiede, the lieutenant governor's executive assistant, said
Thursday. She said the gavel has been missing since legislators
left Austin earlier this week after wrapping up the session on
workers' compensation revisions.
   ``I mean, we operate on the honors system here,'' she said.
``It's kind of understood that you don't make off with the
paintings on the wall, you don't take the bronze busts and you
don't steal the gavel.''
   The oak gavel, made by Texas prison inmates, is nearly 2 feet
long and weighs about 4 pounds.
   ``It doesn't have much monetary value,'' Tiede said. ``However,
it has a lot of sentimental value at this point. We thought (Hobby)
might want to present it to someone.''
   Carleton Turner, Senate sergeant-at-arms, issued a memo to all
Senate offices Wednesday, asking staff members to look out for the
gavel.
   ``I'm not assuming any of the senators did it,'' Turner said.
``The Senate chamber is open at times when there is nobody in
there. It would have been easy for someone to slip in and take it.''
   State Sen. Carl Parker, who opposed the workers' compensation
legislation proposed by Hobby, suggested that it was ``was probably
stolen by a representative of the insurance industry who wants to
enshrine it as a holy object.''

   More than 11,000 Vietnamese refugees who may be
forced to return to their homeland held protest marches for a third
day today and burned an effigy of British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   Meanwhile, the Hong Kong's governor said no more boat people
will be sent home against their will before Christmas.
   Refugees in six camps around this British colony took part in
today's demonstrations, which have widened in scope daily since the
forced repatriation of 51 boat people on Tuesday.
   The protesters are among about 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed
into Hong Kong since June 1988 and are considered illegal
``economic migrants'' unless they can prove they fled their
Communist homeland fearing persecution.
   Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after being
screened by immigration officials and face repatriation, compared
with slightly more than 700 who have qualified for overseas
resettlement.
   Although the protests have been peaceful, about 100 Vietnamese
late Thursday attacked a prison officer with iron bars as he
investigated a crowd gathering inside the Chi Ma Wan camp. The
officer suffered minor injuries.
   Today, about 4,000 boat people marched inside the Whitehead
Detention Center in the New Territories. About 2,500 others chanted
slogans as they marched between huts in the High Island reception
center next to a rural park, the government said.
   About 550 boat people staged a sit-in at Sek Kong Detention
Center in the New Territories, 3,000 others participated in the
third day of protest marches at Hei Ling Chau camp on an outlying
island, and 1,000 Vietnamese demonstrated at Sham Shui Po Detention
Center in urban Kowloon. A few hundred protested at Chi Ma Wan.
   An effigy of Mrs. Thatcher, who has strongly defended the forced
repatriation program by this British colony, was burned at the Sham
Shui Po protest, a government spokesman said.
   Governor Sir David Wilson said today that more Vietnamese will
be sent back against their will but: ``We haven't got a flight plan
before Christmas.''
   Wilson acknowledged the program has led to widespread
international criticism, saying: ``We certainly face the fact there
has been a very emotional reaction against what we've done.''
   But he added that none of the critics has put forth a viable
alternative to solve the problem posed by the massive influx of
boat people.
   Journalists have not been allowed inside the detention centers
in recent weeks, but relief agencies say the atmosphere is tense.
   ``I think the feeling is that there is a great deal of tension
in the camps,'' said Jim Campion of Refugee Concern Hong Kong, an
advocacy group for the boat people. ``Whether that is going to
spill out or explode remains to be seen.''
   About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in squalid camps in Hong
Kong, but only 4,500 refugees have been resettled so far this year.
Britain argues returning the refugees home is more humane than
keeping them indefinitely in crowded centers that are rife with
violence and disease.
   The United States has condemned the forced repatriation.
   The approximately 12,000 boat people in Hong Kong who arrived
before June 1988 are considered refugees eligible for resettlement.

   NATO foreign ministers today endorsed a
plan to allow unarmed military jets from Eastern bloc countries to
fly over their territory as part of efforts to further reduce
East-West military tensions.
   The endorsement ended two days of talks and followed the
announcement of a a historic visit by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze to North Atlantic Treaty Organization
headquarters Tuesday, the first ever by a Soviet foreign minister.
   The ministers proposed that the overflights include Europe, the
Soviet Union, the United States and Canada. Larger countries would
allow several flights a month.
   The NATO position will be presented to Eastern negotiators at a
conference in February in Ottawa.
   Plans for the Soviet visit overshadowed the opening day of NATO
talks, during which U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
outlined plans for shaping a wider political role for the alliance
in an era of reduced tensions.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner told reporters that
during the Soviet visit the two sides will discuss ``matters of
common interest. This is a first contact.''
   Baker, in a separate news conference, quipped, ``I don't see it
paving the way for Soviet membership in NATO.''
   He said he doubted he would make a similar visit to the Warsaw
Pact because the Soviet-led alliance has no exact counterpart to
Woerner.
   Shevardnadze will be in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday to sign a
new trade and economic cooperation agreement with the 12-nation
European Community.
   In their final statement, the ministers welcomed the political
and economic reforms under way in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe and urged that ``the progress achieved must be consolidated.
   ``Many problems remain,'' they said. ``The rule of law and
democratic government through free elections have yet to be fully
institutionalized.''
   There was no alternative, they said, to the alliance's strategy
of deterrence to prevent war, based on a mix of conventional and
nuclear weapons.
   Opening NATO skies to unarmed Warsaw Pact planes was first
proposed by President Bush in the spring.
   ``The willingness of a country to be overflown is, in itself, a
highly significant political act in that it demonstrates its
availability to openness,'' the NATO ministers said. ``Aerial
inspection also represents a particularly effective means of
verification'' of arms control agreements.
   Under the plan, countries would be assigned quotas, based on
their geographic size, limiting the number of observation flights
by unarmed, fixed-wing aircraft. The duration of flights would also
be limited.
   The ministers gave their backing to the eventual reunification
of East and West Germany but through peaceful and democratic means.
The language was identifical to that included in a statement issued
over the weekend by leaders of the 12-nation European Community at
a summit in Strasbourg, France.
   They reiterated the importance of NATO as an ``indispensable
foundation of stability, security and cooperation for the future of
Europe.''
   The ministers said the surveillance could be used in making sure
countries comply with the conventional arms agreement being
negotiated in Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. They also
renewed their commitment to reach an agreement this year on
reducing tanks, armored personnel carriers and other military
hardware in Europe.
   On Thursday, Baker sketched his ideas for a broader political
role for the alliance. He foresees NATO as a permanent monitor of
the reductions being negotiated in conventional, or non-nuclear,
arms in Europe and as a mediator of regional conflicts.

<HEAD>Bail Set for Former DEA Agent Accused in Corruption-Drug Dealing
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former U.S. drug agent accused of
corruption, drug dealing and money laundering has been granted $1
million bail, but if he posts it he must stay under house arrest.
   U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter set bail Thursday over the
objections of prosecutors who maintained that former Drug
Enforcement Administration agent John Jackson was a risk to flee.
   Jackson, 40, of Claremont, could be released as soon as next
week from the downtown federal Metropolitan Detention Center. He
has been in custody since his Nov. 22, 1988 arrest.
   Jackson and two other former DEA agents, Darnell Garcia, 42, of
Rancho Palos Verdes, and Wayne Countryman, 46, of Walnut, were
charged in a 42-count indictment with trafficking cocaine and
heroin and laundering the proceeds through banks in Switzerland and
Luxembourg.
   Jackson's wife, Barbara, 41, and a former business partner,
Sherman Lair, 39, of Alta Loma, also were charged.
   Hatter ordered Jackson to be electronically monitored if he goes
free and to seek permission from parole officers to leave his home
for a doctor's visit or an emergency.
   Monitoring usually is done through a bracelet locked to the
wearer's ankle or wrist that emits a coded electronic signal.
   Jackson's lawyer, Terry Amdur, said his client was confined to
the special housing unit at the downtown Metropolitan Detention
Center, an area reserved for problem prisoners or arrested law
enforcement officers who cannot safely mix with inmates.
   Garcia, a fugitive for seven months, was arrested in Luxembourg
in July. He was sentenced to six months in jail by a Belgium court
for a passport violation, and U.S. authorities have requested his
extradition when his term ends in a few weeks.
   The trial for all the defendants has been scheduled for April.

   Three policemen and a police
informer were killed when a mine was detonated under their vehicle,
authorities said today.
   The incident occurred late Thursday outside Motherwell, a black
township near the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth, police
headquarters in Johannesburg said. No further details were given.
   Police reported two bombings today on rail lines in the Cape
Town area, apparently related to the 6-week-old strike by 25,000
black employees of the state-owned transport company. The blasts
caused minor damage and no injuries, and one man was arrested,
police said.
   Officials of South African Transport Services said it had fired
2,400 more strikers, raising to more than 19,700 the number
dimissed during the walkout.
   Police said two children of a black spokesman for the transport
company were burned to death Thursday when their house near
Pretoria was set afire. Investigators were trying to determine if
the incident was related to the strike.
   In De Aar, in northern Cape Province, a black constable today
shot and killed a person who was part of a crowd throwing stones at
his home. In Soweto, Johannesburg's main black township, a black
man shot and wounded two policemen before he was arrested,
authorities said.
   No further details about these incidents were released.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC says it will start producing a limited
edition of a $576,000 car that can attain speeds of more than 200
mph.
   Chairman Sir John Egan said Thursday that the car, the XJ220, is
as exciting as Jaguar's D-type, which was introduced in the 1950s.
``It is a very interesting project and could herald a pattern for
the future,'' he said.
   The concept model was first revealed at the International Motor
Show last year, and consumer interest was so strong that Jaguar
believes it is assured of getting buyers for an initial production
of 220 cars.
   Output could increase to a maximum of 350 cars, if demand is
strong enough, said the chairman of the British car maker, which is
being acquired by Ford Motor Co. for $2.5 billion.
   ``After this we might look at another limited edition. More
super cars could follow if there is a demand,'' he said. He added
that more than 200 new jobs would be created when production
started at a new factory currently being built in Oxfordshire in
western England.
   Fifty engineers were already working on the project, he said.
   The car will be available in left-hand and right-hand drive, but
will not be exported to the United States since it will only meet
European regulations.
   The cars are to be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.
   Each of the cars will be numbered and customers will have to put
down a deposit of $80,000. The cars will be delivered in 1992,
Jaguar said.

<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov was remembered today by
colleagues in science, human rights and public affairs as the
conscience of a nation struggling to free itself from decades of
official lies and corruption.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years
of internal exile, called Sakharov a ``man of conviction and
sincerity.''
   ``It's a great loss,'' Gorbachev said. ``Academician Sakharov
during this time of perestroika had his mission, his role, and that
we all understood.''
   ``He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions
which he expressed openly and directly. This doesn't mean I agreed
with him, although on many things we did agree,'' he said.
   Gorbachev had repeatedly clashed with Sakharov recently over the
pace and type of reform in the Soviet Union.
   ``We have lost our moral compass,'' said Roald Sagdeyev, the
former head of the Soviet space program who worked with Sakharov in
the Congress of People's Deputies and the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, and was named to an official funeral commission.
   ``An outstanding person has died, such as maybe appears once in
a hundred years,'' said fellow deputy Alexei Kazannik of Omsk.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, including both supporters and
political foes of Sakharov, stood for a minute of silence today
morning when his death Thursday night was announced.
   Linguist Dmitri Likhachev, one of the country's most respected
scholars, told the deputies: ``With Sakharov, a part of our heart
has departed from us. We could agree or disagree with him, but he
was a man of absolute sincerity and absolute purity, and this led
him to achievements in science and his position in public life.''
   Even long-time members of the Communist Party apparatus, which
under President Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1980 ordered his exile to the
industrial city of Gorky, praised his honesty and principle.
   Sakharov was exiled Jan. 22, 1980, for criticizing the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan less than a month earlier. But society,
as well as top officials, now agree with Sakharov's point of view.
   Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, a Politburo member, told
the Congress that Sakharov had been ``one of the country's greatest
scientists, a major public figure.''
   ``Everything that he did was dictated by his tireless
conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' Vorotnikov said.
   Another Politburo member, conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, told
the Tass news agency: ``I was very well disposed toward Sakharov as
a personality.''
   ``He did much for the country. He adhered to different views and
positions, but this is only natural,'' Ligachev said.
   Sakharov's last political battle was to try to break the
monopoly on political power enjoyed by Vorotnikov, Ligachev and
other members of the Communist Party apparatus.
   Sakharov said in his last public statement that the leadership
was bringing the country to a catastrophe. He supported a call to
create a formal political opposition.
   Yuri Afanasyev, a historian who sided with Sakharov in that
political battle, pledged to continue his work. ``We will continue
to support the things that he devoted his life to,'' Afanasyev said.
   Communist reformer Boris N. Yeltsin, who with Afanasyev and
Sakharov was a co-chairman of the Inter-Regional Deputies group of
legislators, told Tass that Sakharov was ``the people's conscience,
and all honest people in the U.S.S.R. and throughout the world will
grieve for him.''
   Sakharov's relationship with Gorbachev was difficult politically
but based on a mutual understanding of each other's importance,
said historian Roy Medvedev, who knew Sakharov for many years.
   ``Sakharov realized the great significance of Gorbachev's
reforms, while Gorbachev realized Sakharov's significance in
political life, helped him return to politics,'' Medvedev told Tass.
   ``Sometimes Sakharov went even further and demanded from Soviet
society more than it could provide. But he always treated Gorbachev
with great respect and always stressed this,'' he said.
   A veteran U.S. Embassy official in Moscow, Deputy Chief of
Mission John M. Joyce, told reporters Sakharov was important to his
country both for the practical work he did and as a symbol of
something better.
   ``If this country is fortunate, the goals he set will someday be
reality,'' Joyce said.

   The government today recalled more than
100,000 models of a children's playset because they contain small
parts that may present a choking hazard to young children.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the manufacturer has
agreed to replace three components of the plastic ``Play to Learn''
furniture set, model 1411, made by JA-RU, Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla.
   The agency said two play figures _ a girl and a boy _ and a
plastic lounge chair included in the set are small parts which if
swallowed by young children may cause them to choke.
   Approximately 144,000 sets were sold nationwide since January
1987 but there have been no reports of injury, the commission said.
   Consumers should take the hazardous parts away from children and
request replacements by writing the manufacturer at 4030 Phillips
Highway, Jacksonville, Fla., 32217 or calling 904-733-9311.

<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said
today it will conduct a hearing focusing on Boeing 737 rudder trim
design and cockpit performance in the crash of a USAir jetliner at
New York's LaGuardia Airport.
   The four-day hearing is to begin Feb. 13 at the Penta Hotel in
New York, said spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
   The Sept. 20 accident, in which the aircraft skidded off the end
of the runway into New York's East River after pilots aborted its
takeoff, killed two passengers. The plane lodged on a landing pier
and broke into pieces.
   Board Chairman James Kolstad, who will conduct the hearing, said
he expects about 16 witnesses to testify on cockpit crew training
and coordination, design and operation of the rudder trim system
and other issues.
   ``As tragic as this accident was, it could have been much
worse,'' Kolstad said. ``We have mechanical and human performance
issues to resolve in the course of this investigation, and the
hearing will provide us with valuable information on both issues.''
   The board did not announce who the witnesses would be, but
surviving crew members often testify at such hearings. ``We may not
know until just before the hearing whether they will appear,'' said
Lopatkiewicz.
   Investigators said the plane's tail rudder, used in steering the
airliner, was misaligned despite evidence that the crew made all
the proper checks. The pilot reported the plane was drifting to the
left before he aborted the takeoff. This focused attention on the
trim system that holds the rudder steady during takeoff.
   The Federal Aviation Administration suspended the pilot's
licenses of Capt. Michael W. Martin and co-pilot Constantine
Kleissas after the crash for their failure to appear immediately
for drug tests and questioning by investigators.
   The safety board's New York hearing will include a panel of
senior NTSB staff members and a technical panel of investigators,
as well as representatives of the FAA, the Boeing Co. and the Air
Line Pilots Association.
   The board, which is an independent federal agency, has no
rule-making or enforcement powers. Its findings of probable cause
and recommendations will be included in a report to be adopted at a
public meeting several months after the hearing, although it can
issue urgent recommendations at any time.

<TEXT>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted
today to increase transit fares, raising the New York City subway
fare from $1 to $1.15.
   The new fares, most of which represent an increase of about 15
percent, take effect Jan. 1.
   They range from the 15-cent increase for subways and buses to a
50 cent rise to $4 for express buses in Queens and Staten Island
and an 85 cent increase to $6.35 for the JFK airport express train.
   The board approved the changes as demonstrators waved signs
protesting the fare hike and chanted, ``Do the right thing! Stop
the fare hike!'' One sign-holder was hustled from the hearing room
after he approached the table where the board members were seated.
   Initially, the Transit Authority proposed sending bus and subway
fares to $1.25 with discount packages of 18 selling for $20.
Opponents claimed the idea would discriminate against low-income
riders.
   ``The hearings and the public-comment period served their
purpose, which was to get the views of the public and translate
them to some degree to the proposals that are being made,'' said
Tito Davila, a spokesman for the state Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.
   The 15-cent increase will add about $200 million to Transit
Authority coffers; the railroads would add another $49 million or
so and the suburban buses $3 million to $4 million, Davila said.

   The crew of a nuclear powered
submarine launched its third Trident 2 missile in less than two
weeks today, sending an unarmed warhead far down the Atlantic
tracking range, the Navy reported.
   The success was the fourth in six undersea firings of the
Trident 2. Three more such tests are planned, leading to
operational deployment of the weapon in March.
   Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists were not on the scene today as
the Tennessee unleashed the 44-foot, $26.5-million missile, the
Navy's newest weapon.
   On Dec. 4, a large Greenpeace vessel was rammed by a Navy ship
and two motorized rafts operated by protesters were rounded up and
escorted away when they entered the danger zone to try to stop the
launch.
   A launch was conducted on Wednesday after the Navy warned a
60-foot Greenpeace ketch out of a 5,000-yard safety zone
surrounding the submarine.
   Shannon Fagan, a Greenpeace spokesman, said Thursday the group
was leaving the area and would take its fight to Congress.
   The Navy reported the success of today's launch 10 minutes after
the 9:15 a.m. firing, which took place in the Atlantic about 50
miles offshore.
   The Tennessee will be the first of 24 Trident 2 subs to go to
sea with the missile. The submarine will carry 24 of the weapons,
each able to hurl as many as 12 nuclear warheads to individual
targets more than 4,600 miles away.

   Redoubt Volcano hurled a cloud of
volcanic ash into the sky again early today, a day after it roared
into action, and a pilot reported the gritty ash cloud extended 160
miles from the mountain.
   Thursday's eruption, the volcano's first activity in 23 years,
flung ash seven miles high and prompted the evacuation of seven oil
workers.
   Don Richter, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, said
Redoubt erupted today from 1:40 a.m. to about 4:30 a.m.
   ``It was powerful,'' Richter said.
   ``A pilot reported an ash cloud extending from Redoubt to
Talkeetna at 3:39,'' he said, adding that there were some reports
of flashing lights that probably were caused by glowing lava.
   Richter said the high-altitude cloud of airborne ash blew past
Anchorage and was falling in less populated areas.
   He said more eruptions were likely. ``I don't like to use the
word `normal,' but a group of eruptions is typical of a volcano,''
he said.
   Thursday's eruption of Redoubt, near the western edge of Cook
Inlet, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, came a day after
scientists detected a significant increase in seismic activity, the
Geological Survey said.
   It ``looked like a little cloud rising over the mountain and it
just started rising like an atomic bomb when it mushrooms,'' said
Kristopher Paull, pilot of an airliner in the area Thursday.
   Ash rose from 15,000 feet to about 40,000 feet within 10
minutes, said Air Force Capt. Steve Stoddard, who was flying an
F-15 jet fighter west of Anchorage.
   Seven of 11 workers at the Drift River oil storage facility were
evacuated as a precaution against flooding from melting snow, said
the manager of Cook Inlet Pipeline Co., operator of the facility.
Such flooding occurred when the volcano last erupted in 1966.
   Manager Harold Mouser said the workers were transported in two
airplanes, one of which was at the site for a routine grocery
delivery. A helicopter stood by for possible evacuation of the four
employees who remained at the site as monitors, he said.
   A truck driver who was on the Sterling Highway, across the inlet
from the volcano, when the eruption occurred said the ash was
``real white and fluffy, almost like a cumulus cloud.''
   John Paskievitch, a geologist for the U.S. Geological Survey,
said seismic activity beneath the volcano returned to normal soon
after the eruption. He said it was impossible to predict whether
more eruptions would occur.
   The Alaska Division of Emergency Services said a light dusting
of ash was observed in the Wasilla area, about 40 miles northeast
of Anchorage, shortly after noon Thursday.
   Redoubt Volcano is within the Lake Clark National Park and
Preserve and has been active at least four times during this
century.

   Leaders and human rights activists worldwide today praised
Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived
his Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root
throughout Eastern Europe.
   The 68-year-old scientist and human rights activist died
Thursday night of an apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment,
his family said.
   The Soviet Congress stood for a minute of silence for their
colleague, once considered a national hero for discovering the
Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by Kremlin leadership for
his uncompromising stands for human freedom.
   He was released from internal exile by Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in 1986 and became a member of the Congress. One
lawmaker called him a man ``such as maybe appears once in a hundred
years.''
   Aase Lionaes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that
awarded Sakharov the Peace Prize in 1975, said he ``fell in the
struggle for democratic reforms. His death represents a great loss,
especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the
Soviet Union and in all Eastern Europe.''
   Political leaders worldwide commended Sakharov as a man whose
causes went beyond ideology.
   Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said
Sakharov's death was ``a great loss for reform both in the Soviet
Union and everywhere else.''
   ``It is very bad that God's sentences are such,'' Walesa, the
leader of the Solidarity labor movement, told the Polish news
agency PAP in Gdansk. ``We needed this man for reforms and for the
troubles connected with them.''
   ``He was just a remarkable person,'' said British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. ``He was one of those who would always say the
truth must be found and was never afraid of stating that and
letting everyone know.''
   ``It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future
of the Soviet Union,'' she told reporters in London.
   In Strasbourg, France, the 518-member European Parliament today
unanimously paid tribute to Sakharov, whose name it had given to
its Human Rights Prize.
   A White House statement today hailed Sakharov as a historic
figure whose voice ``was an important dimension in the contemporary
changes under way in Soviet society.
   In Brussels, Belgium, where he was attending a NATO conference,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sakharov was ``a
tremendous force for peace and freedom.''
   The NATO foreign ministers hailed Sakharov as a pioneer who
helped change Soviet society. NATO Secretary General Manfred
Woerner said, ``The ministers expressed deeply felt sense of loss
at the passing of Andrei Sakharov.''
   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in
Soviet labor camps before immigrating to Israel in 1986, told
Israel radio today that Sakharov had helped thousands of Soviet
Jewish refuseniks.
   ``Sakharov had tremendous influence ... among dissidents, among
free people in the Soviet Union and who by his own personal example
helped change the whole climate in the Soviet Union,'' Sharansky
said.
   Marie Staunton, director of the human rights group Amnesty
International, said Sakharov ``represented a whole generation of
people who were very brave in standing up and struggling in what
seemed at that time a hopeless situation.''
   ``Everybody looked up to him, his death is really the end of an
era,'' she told the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Britain Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: ``I hope the torch
will be handed on and that that work, which is not yet complete,
will be carried forward by people who will remember him.''
   Roland Leroy, member of the Politburo of the French Communist
Party and editor of the Communist Party organ L'Humanite:
   ``He was a victim of the repression of the Brezhnev period. His
name became a symbol of this repression. Today, he dies a deputy in
the congress of the people where he was able to express his opinion
freely.''
   Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing recalled
Sakharov's legendary drive and benevolence:
   ``I remember the emotion I felt last winter, climbing the damp
and dilapidated stairway that led to his apartment. It was he who
partially opened the door. I saw on his face the signs of a great
man: intelligence and goodness.
   ``He seemed luminous. That light has gone out. The flame that
lived within him will burn forever. His way of defending liberty
and human rights was not that of a doctrinaire, but of a liberal.
In the passion of his combat, he conserved his benevolence.''

<TEXT>
   A six-member House delegation headed back to
the United States today after secret meetings in Colombia with
President Virgilio Barco and top aides to discuss support for
anti-drug efforts in the violence-torn nation.
   Aides said the lawmakers would brief President Bush before his
upcoming drug summit with leaders of the Andean nations in
Cartagena, Colombia, on Feb. 15.
   The two-day trip, kept secret because of concerns the
congressmen could become targets of cocaine traffickers, included
meetings with Barco as well as Colombia's defense and justice
ministers, national police director, the attorney general,
Colombian presidential candidates and U.S. Ambassador Thomas
McNamara.
   Barco met Sept. 28-29 with Bush and House leaders in Washington
to discuss American cooperation with the war on drug traffickers he
declared three months ago. The United States has asked the Colombia
government to extradite suspected traffickers indicted in this
country on drug charges.
   The delegation was led by Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the House Narcotics Abuse and Control Committee.
Members included Reps. Frank Guarini and William Hughes, both
D-N.J.; Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.; Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y.; and
Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   Bob Weiner, a spokesman for Rangel's committee, said the
congressmen traveled to show American support for Colombia's
anti-drug efforts as a wave of bombings and assassinations
continues. He said they also were demonstrating to Bush that they
could achieve safe passage to Colombia.
   Among those killed have been 50 judges, two newspaper
publishers, the chief of the narcotics police and a leading
presidential candidate. A bombing earlier this month wounded an
estimated 1,000 people in the capital city of Bogota.
   Hughes, who is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
crime, is concerned about maintaining an ongoing dialogue with
Barco, spokesman Mark Brown said.
   ``They're taking some extraordinary actions and extraordinary
risks to handle this drug problem,'' Brown said of Colombian
officials.
   Hughes, author of a law to control diversion of drug refining
and processing chemicals, has said the flow of those chemicals and
assault weapons from the United States to Colombia has been
undermining local efforts to crack down on drug trafficking.

   President Bush today offered his condolences
to Yelena Bonner, the wife of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei
D.Sakharov, saying ``all of us are diminished by his utimely
death.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush sent a message
to the widow of the Nobel laureate early today.
   ``On behalf of all the American people, I would like to extend
to you and your family our deepest condolences on the death of your
husband, Dr. Sakharov,'' the message read.
   ``All of us who knew him will never forget his courage and
devotion to freedom. In the darkest hours of his struggle for human
rights in the Soviet Union, he embodied all that is good and decent
in the human spirit. He died as he lived, struggling in the Supreme
Soviet to codify in law the ideals for which he always stood.
   ``Just as he truly enriched all of us with his life, all of us
are diminished by his untimely death. Barbara joins me in sending
you our personal sympathy and prayers for this sad hour.''
   Fitzwater said the United States would send a delegation to
Sakharov's funeral, but that it had not been decided who would be
in it.
   Sakharov, who built the Soviet hydrogen bomb and became a beacon
for the world in the cause of human rights, died at age 68. The
1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner died alone in his study Thursday
night of an apparent heart attack, said his son-in-law, Yefrem
Yankelevich.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Grants Amnesty to Political Prisoners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament today passed an amnesty for
political prisoners and changed the penal code so that Bulgarians
can no longer be prosecuted for ``anti-state activity'' and
``crimes against allied states.''
   On Thursday, Justice Minister Svetla Daskalova told parliament
that 53 prisoners would be released in the amnesty. It was not
immediately clear if other political detainees would remain in
custody.
   The vote on the penal code changes was unanimous.
   Last month, Parliament granted amnesty to people jailed for
slandering the state and the Communist Party. Before they were
freed, independent rights groups in the West said there were up to
250 political prisoners in Bulgaria.
   Also today, Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov for the first time
publicized figures on the country's defense spending. Dzhurov told
lawmakers the nation spent $670 million over the past year and that
the army has 107,000 soldiers.
   The National Assembly, in a further move to strip former
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov of all his public functions,
formally terminated his role as commander in chief of the armed
forces, which he held as president. He lost that post after being
replaced as party chief by Petar Mladenov on Nov. 10.
   The National Assembly made President Mladenov commander in chief.
   The moves are the latest in Bulgaria's whirlwind drive to
transform itself from a hard-line Communist state to one at the
forefront of the pro-democracy reform movement sweeping Eastern
Europe.
   When the legislature opened its session Thursday, tens of
thousands of people demonstrated outside the building to demand
that the party's leading role, as provided for in the constitution,
be abolished.
   The Communist faction in the parliament had proposed the
constitutional clause be scrapped, but officials in Parliament used
a legal technicality to postpone debate on the proposal until
January.
   Before it closed its session this afternoon, parliament adopted
its agenda for the January session, which will include debate on a
new electoral law providing for free elections and a law on
redistribution of land in this traditionally agrarian country.
   In accordance with another Communist proposal adopted at a party
Central Committee session this week, Parliament set up a commission
to investigate corruption under the Zhivkov regime.
   Parliament voted to include opposition members who are not
lawmakers on the commission. This was one of the oppositions'
demands, which have been applauded by tens of thousands of
Bulgarians at rallies this week.

King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize for 1990.
   Lowery has headed the SCLC, a civil-rights group founded by King
more than 30 years ago, since 1977.
   He will receive the $1,000 prize next month at Atlanta's
Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached, during the 21st
annual Ecumenical service, officials with the Martin Luther King
Center for Nonviolent Social Change announced Thursday.
   The service will be held on Jan. 15, King's birthday. The
service concludes a nine-day observance of King's 61st birthday
anniversary.
   ``Dr. Lowery's life and work provide a shining affirmation of
our 1990 King Week theme, `Nonviolence: A Time to Act, A Way to

Thursday.
   Others who have received the peace prize include President
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines in 1987, Rosa Parks in 1980,
former President Carter in 1979 and labor activist Cesar Chavez in
1974.

<TEXT>
   The nation's high court today
overturned convictions imposed in a controversial treason trial and
set free five black activists, three of them senior anti-apartheid
leaders jailed since 1985.
   ``It's fantastic, because now justice has been vindicated,''
said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, when he and other supporters
were told the five men were being flown from their island prison in
Cape Town to Johannesburg.
   The three leaders of the United Democratic Front and one of
their co-defendants, a church worker, were convicted of treason in
November 1988 after a three-year trial. Their sentences ranged from
six to 12 years.
   The Appeal Court in Bloemfontein overturned the verdicts of
those four and seven co-defendants convicted of terrorism. One of
the seven, who was serving a five-year term, was freed. The others
had received suspended sentences.
   The Appeal Court accepted defense lawyers' arguments that the
trial judge, Kees van Dijkhorst, improperly dismissed one of the
two legal experts assisting him in the trial.
   Van Dijkhorst had said the law professor, W.A. Joubert, was too
sympathetic to the United Democratic Front because he had signed a
UDF-supported petition opposing a new constitition that entrenched
racially segregated politics.
   During the trial, most of the defendants were granted bail.
   But van Dijkhorst repeatedly denied bail requests by the three
leaders of the United Democratic Front, a huge multiracial
coalition formed in 1983 to campaign for black political rights.
   Lawyers for Human Rights, an association of civil rights
lawyers, hailed the Appeal Court ruling as ``an excellent victory''
that would help restore the crebility of the South African
judiciary.
   The group called on the government to disclose how much it spent
``on this abortive prosecution which took years of blundering
incompetence to achieve nothing but red faces.''
   Ambassador Ronald MacLean of Canada, one of many countries which
denounced the sentences, said the Appeal Court ruling was ``the
best Christmas present imaginable.''
   Van Dijkhorst had ruled that the United Democratic Front was a
``revolutionary organization'' which incited violence in black
townships in 1984 in a bid to render South Africa ungovernable.
   Patrick Lekota, 41, the front's publicity secretary, was
sentenced to 12 years in prison; Pope Molefe, 37, the front's
national secretary, and Moses Chikane, 41, secretary of the
Transvaal Province Branch, were sentenced to 10 years. The Rev. Tom
Manthata, 49, a church field worker, was sentenced to six years.
   The trial began in 1985 in the small farming town of Delams and
later was shifted to Pretoria. Eleven of the original 22 defendants
were acquitted at various stages.
   The four men convicted of treason were imprisoned on Robben
Island, in Cape Town's harbor, where many political and security
prisoners have been held. Friends and relatives gathered at a ferry
dock in Cape Town, awaiting their arrival.
   Among the crowd was Manthata's 5-year-old daughter, Goitse, who
was crying with joy.
   All four men are married and have children. Lekota and Chikane
each have daughters who were born after they were jailed in 1985
and who have never seen their fathers as free men.
   Also on hand at the ferry landing was one of the defense
attorneys, David Dyson. He said the appeal court ruling appeared to
be based solely on legal questions and doubted it was related to
the changing political climate brought about by President F.W. de
Klerk's easing of curbs on opposition activity.
   The trial was one of the longest in South African history, with
439 days of court proceedings spread over more than three years.
The 368-page indictment named more than 900 alleged
co-conspirators, ranging from Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu to
African National Congress leader Oliver Tambo. There were more than
220 witnesses and the official court record contained about 30,000
pages.
   Van Dijkhorst accepted the prosecutors' allegations that the
core of the United Democratic Front's leadership was supported and
guided by the outlawed ANC, the main anti-government guerrilla
movement.

   Bad weather today forced the Ku Klux Klan to
cancel a march set for Saturday to protest the suspensions of two
boys who wore Klan robes to high school for Halloween and shouted
racial slurs.
   ``I talked to the imperial wizard,'' said police Lt. Bob
Holzworth. ``He indicated for safety reasons, they decided to call
off the march.''
   The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for
the southern half of Ohio, with 4 to 6 inches of snow forecast by
Friday night. High temperatures Saturday are to reach only the
teens, with wind chills below zero.
   Earlier, Klan officials had expected 500 members and
sympathizers in Oxford for the march.
   The southwestern Ohio town, the home of Miami University, has a
population of about 20,000. About 50 of the school's 1,100 students
are black.
   Ernie Edwards of Morrow, who said he represented a Klan group
called the U.S. Knights, obtained a city permit to march to counter
a protest by black residents a week after the Halloween incident.

<HEAD>US Worried About Possible Terrorist Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed concern today
about the possibility that Middle Eastern terrorists may be
planning a variety of attacks, perhaps against U.S. targets in
Western Europe or West Africa.
   A brief statement said the concern was based partly on recent
reports of movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the
discovery of weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in
Spain and Africa.
   ``If credible, specific information or a threat to the public is
received, the Department of State will provide additional
information for travelers and other concerned parties,'' the
statement said.
   A State Department official, who asked not to be identified,
said the administration has begun briefing foreign governments
about its concerns and felt that a warning to the public also was
appropriate.
   One reason for increased fears of terrorist attack, the official
said, is the seizure of 440 pounds of explosives Nov. 23 in
Valencia, Spain, and the arrest of eight suspected Shiite Moslem
extremists by Spanish police.
   A French police report said the men and explosives were headed
for France. According to Spanish police, at least three of the men
are members of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group of extremist Shiites
based in Lebanon.
   The official also said there are several anniversaries coming up
that terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out violent
activities.
   One was the still unresolved bombing of Pan Am flight 103 on
Dec. 21, 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, with a death toll of 259
aboard the craft and 11 on the ground.
   According to investigators, evidence points to the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command as the responsible
group.
   Another December incident was the terrorist attacks on airports
in Rome and Vienna two days after Christmas in 1985.
   The official said they also are wary because the number of
Americans in Europe increases sharply during the Christmas season.
   Today's advisory contained scant information, but it followed a
series of precautionary steps by the French government to guard
against the possibility of terrorist attacks during the holiday
season.
   Interior and justice ministers from the European Community were
meeting in France on Thursday and today to coordinate efforts to
track down a Shiite militant group reportedly responsible for the
movement of explosives from Spain and to France and Cyprus as well.
   Some French officials believe the principal aim of the group may
be to try to dissuade France from from opposing an assault in
Lebanon on the Christian forces of Gen. Michel Auon by a pro-Syrian
Muslim coalition.
   The French action also coincides with the impending trial of one
accused terrorist charged in bombing incidents and a hunger strike
by a convicted terrorist who is serving a life term for trying to
kill former Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar.
   In the latter case, involving the conviction of Anis Naccache,
the Iranian government has repeatedly demanded that he be released.

   The 4-year-old boy watched as the
television news flashed a picture of jailed South African black
leader Nelson Mandela.
   The somewhat dated photograph did not make an impression on the
child, the second generation of Mandela's family who has had to see
him from afar.
   ``That's how he used to look,'' the child's mother, Makaziwe
Mandela, said Wednesday as she watched the report of a historic
meeting between her father and South African President F.W. de
Klerk.
   The South African Press Association said there was speculation
de Klerk could announce a date for Mandela's release in a speech
Saturday commemorating the Day of the Vow, a major holiday for the
Afrikaners who control the government.
   Although many predict Mandela will be released in January, his
daughter is suspicious of the white-led government that imprisoned
her father in 1962.
   ``Being a South African and having grown up in South Africa, I
still have the negative feeling that they've got something up their
sleeve,'' she said from her modest apartment near the University of
Massachusetts, where she is a Fulbright scholar studying
anthropology.
   But that doesn't stop her from hoping.
   ``As a daughter there is a little bit of excitement ... At least
I am hoping,'' said Makaziwe Mandela, 35, who last saw her father
earlier this year. ``I barely know my father.''
   The youngest of three children from Mandela's first marriage,
``Maki'' Mandela was 8 years old when her father went to prison.
She saw little of him when she was growing up, and she said having
a heroic figure for a father was sometimes difficult.
   Seeing other children with fathers at home, or hearing of some
in the movement who had left the country with their families, she
questioned why her father allowed himself ``to get caught and go to
jail.''
   But by her mid-20s, she ``came slowly to the realization of why
my father had done what he had done,'' she says.
   In 1985, she decided to come to the United States to study. Her
husband, Isaac Amuah, a schoolteacher, later joined her and is
pursuing postdoctoral studies. They live here with their three
young children and plan to return to South Africa, where she hopes
to resume work as a community social worker.
   Wednesday, the 71-year-old Mandela visited de Klerk to discuss
prospects for negotiating an end to South Africa's racial conflict,
the first meeting between the two.
   The meeting was denounced by the far-right Conservative Party in
South Africa and hailed by liberal leaders as a sign that de Klerk,
who took office Aug. 15, accepts Mandela's outlawed guerrilla
movement, the African National Congress, as playing a central role
in any political settlement.
   The black leader's daughter said she's unsure how to read the
actions of de Klerk, who on Oct. 15 ordered the unconditional
release of seven of Mandela's ANC colleagues.
   ``It is a change. Whether it is a positive change or a negative
change I think history will be the better judge,'' she said.
   But she said she doubts her father would stay free for long
unless changes are made in the system.
   ``Unless they give him (a larger role) to play, then I am sad to
say that I think Mandela will go back to jail because he won't sit
quietly and accept the system that he tried to bring down,'' she
said.
   And she said she sees no signs of sweeping changes in South
Africa along the lines of the changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``The biggest challenge facing South Africa is not really the
removal of apartheid _ everybody already knows that apartheid is
going away _ but to change the attitudes of people,'' she said.
``Getting rid of those attitudes is going to be the big problem.''

<HEAD>Colombia Won't Hold Referendum on Extradition of Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate has effectively killed a
proposed referendum that would have allowed Colombians to decide
whether the government should continue extraditing drug traffickers
to the United States.
   ``The issue has been eliminated,'' Interior Minister Carlos
Lemos said after the Senate failed to reach a quorum late Thursday
to vote on legislation that would have allowed the national vote on
extradition.
   The outcome was seen as a victory for President Virgilio Barco
who began battling the nation's cocaine cartels after they started
a fierce bombing and assassination campaign in a bid to stop the
extraditions. Barco believed the traffickers would have intimidated
the people in order to win the vote.
   The Senate vote was necessary to give the House time to approve
the measure before the congressional session ends Saturday.
   The Senate's failure to act also will probably doom
constitutional reforms sought by the Barco government. The House,
in defiance of the administration, attached the referendum proposal
to the reform legislation on Dec. 5.
   Among the proposed reforms is a plan that would allow candidates
backed by leftist guerrillas of the April M19 Movement to run for
congress and win seats with fewer votes than normally required. In
exchange, the guerrillas would lay down their arms.
   M19 said it will cancel its political campaign in light of the
legislative developments. The group said in a communique that the
government should postpone congressional elections scheduled for
March 11 and presidential elections set for May 27.
   ``Normal elections in a country that has become unhinged would
carry us toward greater levels of violence,'' the communique said.
   The M19 Movement is the only one of Colombia's five leftist
guerrilla groups to hold peace talks with the government. The Barco
administration has viewed fulfilling its agreement with M19 as
essential to persuade other groups to negotiate. But administration
officials still appeared pleased by the Senate's failure to vote.
   While constitutional reform may be lost this session, Interior
Minister Lemos told reporters that the sacrifice was worth it
because it prevented ``the interference of drug traffickers in
congressional decisions.''
   The traffickers had sought a national vote on the extraditions.
Lemos has said the drug lords would intimidate voters into
rejecting the policy if balloting on the issue were allowed.
   The government's latest anti-drug offensive began after
traffickers assassinated Sen. Luis Carlos Galan on Aug. 18. He was
a leading presidential candidate and an anti-drug crusader.
   The Barco administration revived its extradition policy with the
United States as part of the crackdown and so far has sent nine
people to the United States to face drug charges.
   Colombia's cocaine barons responded with a bombing campaign. So
far there have been 203 attacks that have killed 188 people and
wounded 1,238.
   Government officials have blamed traffickers for the bombing of
a Colombian airliner on Nov. 27 that exploded shortly after takeoff
from Bogota, killing 107 people on board. Officials also blame the
drug lords for the Dec. 4 bombing of Colombia's secret police
headquarters that killed 63 people.
   A few hours after that blast news media in Medellin received a
communique that said traffickers would continue the attacks until
congress approved a national referendum on the extradition policy.

   A 58-year-old security guard at the Nevada
Test Site collapsed and died 30 minutes after a physical fitness
test.
   Authorities say Clair Robinson died after completing a half-mile

   Test site officials say Robinson had no history of medical
problems and had a physical examination in April. He was medically
certified Dec. 4 as qualified for the fitness test.
   Guards receive six chances to complete the half-mile in 4
minutes, 40 seconds, and the 40-yard dash in 8.5 seconds.
   The test site fitness test came under fire in 1985, two years

mile in 88-degree heat. Two guards died after testing at Energy
Department facilities in Ohio and Washington.
   Robinson was a guard with Wackenhut Services, the private

   The cause of death will be determined by the Clark County
Coroner's Office.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem today
accepted the resignation of his economy minister, apparently in a
move to defuse political opposition to his economic program.
   Minister Nestor Rapanelli, 60, had been criticized for his
business background by the union-based governing Peronist Party.
   Menem replaced him with Erman Gonzalez, a former Central Bank
vice president and minister of social affairs. Gonzalez is a
longtime confidant of Menem and is held in esteem by rank-and-file
Peronists.
   Julio Mera Figueroa, Menem's former campaign chairman, was named
interior minister to replace Eduardo Bauza, who became the new
minister of health.
   Rapanelli's resignation had been anticipated after the economy
did not respond to a 34.5 percent devaluation of the austral this
week.
   Menem scheduled a news conference at which he was expected to
discuss the changes and to defend his 5-month-old government's
program of privatization and deregulation to stabilize Argentina's
economy.
   Gonzalez's appointment was expected to appeal to organized labor
and other factions of the Peronist Party that disagree with Menem's
plans to reduce state spending, sell public companies, lower tariff
barriers and increase taxes.

   There are flags for nations, states, cities,

we need as we move into the most critical decade of human
history,'' Roffmann said.
   ``Our survival depends on our ability to think globally and act
locally,'' he said.
   The 3-by-5 Global Flag is midnight blue, and in the center is a
full-color reproduction of the ``full earth'' photograph taken by
Apollo 17 en route to the moon.
   Roffmann said he and his partner, David Fischer, already had
arranged to have the flag flying at the Global Forum on Environment
and Development for Survival and the Soviet-American Citizens'
Summit, both in Moscow next month.
   They also hope to have it incorporated into World Peace Day
activities around the world on Dec. 31, as well as the global Earth
Day 1990, on April 22.
   ``It would be marvelous if the next time we go to the moon,
instead of planting the American flag, we planted this global
flag,'' Roffmann said.
   In the first few weeks of their project, Roffmann said, about
100 Global Flags have been distributed to people and organizations.
   A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the flags, which run
about $50, will go to organizations involved in Campaign for the
Earth, a 10-year campaign to create a peaceful, sustainable world
that will kick off Dec. 31.

   Velvet-wrapped chunks of the Berlin Wall,
pottery animals that sprout green coats and dolls to stick on car
windows just won't do as gifts for the well-heeled and adventurous
this holiday season.
   There is an abundance of offbeat gifts this Christmas,
particularly for the indulgent rich whose urgent needs are inspired
by Madison Avenue, Rodeo Drive window displays and chic catalogs.
   How about a gift with spirit? Jurgensen's offers Angels Share
fine Scotch whisky in an etched Baccarat crystal decanter for
$8,650 a bottle. One buyer was Dan Marcheano, owner of The Arches

   ``We aren't cracking that sucker open right now, I'll tell you
that. I'm not about to say, `Would you like a $750 shot of
whiskey?''' said Marcheano, who put the precious elixir in a
lighted display case.
   The car culture dictates the wish-list for fast-lane crazies,
and Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories provides drive-time
necessities for those on the fast track. There's a $1,200 car fax
machine, $2,100 Recaro leather seat, $100 monogrammed floor mats
and a $1,500, foot-long crystal Ferrari.
   For the kid who has almost everything, there's a half-scale
Ferrari Testarossa that reaches a maximum speed of 30 mph. It gohe difference
to
customers who buy Chrysler vehicles now.
   There was no immediate reaction to Chrysler's announcement from
General Motors Corp. or Ford Motor Co. In the past, when one of the
Big Three automakers significantly boosted incentive programs,
others followed suit.
   Incentives carry a big risk for the automakers: While cash
rebates or low-interest financing may boost sales, the cost of the
incentives come directly from manufacturer profits.
   In late March, when Ford kicked off incentive programs, GM and
Chrysler followed suit within four days. Those programs stimulated
sales, but dented profits.
   Today's announcement was an attempt to improve Chrysler's
slumping sales.
   Through Dec. 10, the company's car and truck sales were running
6.7 percent behind last year's pace. In recent months the decline
has been more significant.
   Chrysler reported sales declines of 8.6 percent and 9.2 percent
in October and November, respectively. Things have been worse at
GM, where sales fell 18.3 percent and 18.9 percent for the same
months, and at Ford, which reported declines of 11.1 percent for
October and 13.1 percent for November.
   The Big Three reported their earnings were down 8.3 percent
during that three-month period from the same period a year ago, the
most profitable second quarter in auto history.
   Chrysler, which said its incentive costs during the quarter were
20 percent higher than in the year-ago period, reported a 6.4
percent increase in its second-quarter profits.
   Since then, Chrysler's earnings have tumbled. In the third
quarter, the company reported a 77.1 percent decline in earnings,
without a one-time benefit from a sale of stock in Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. Some analysts are forecasting the company will barely
remain profitable in the final quarter of 1989.
   Ford's profits in the third quarter were down 44.3 percent and
GM's were off 39.8 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An artist took a bronze bull by the horns _
well, he used a truck and forklift, actually _ and deposited it in
front of the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``This is my Christmas present for America. For the bullish
country of America,'' sculptor Arturo Di Modica told the New York
Post after he plunked down his three-ton work, ``The Charging
Bull,'' on Wall Street late Thursday.
   Di Modica, who worked on the 11-foot-high bronze statue for two
years in his SoHo studio and said he spent $300,000 on the project,
did not seek a permit to show the work, which he brought in under
cover of darkness.
   ``They wouldn't give me one if I asked,'' he said.
   Di Modica said he chose the location because ``for the stock
market, the bull is strength, and the power of the country is the
stock market.''
   The Sicilian-born sculptor said he began the statue after the
1987 stock market crash. He wanted to create ``a monumental work
attesting to the vitality, energy and life of the American people
in adversity.''
   Despite calling the statue a Christmas present, the artist told
the paper he would like to sell the work. He hopes authorities will
let it stay until New Year's Day.
   Sharon Gamsin, a spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange,
declined to comment on the matter this morning.
   Police want to talk to the person responsible for the statue
before deciding what to do, said Officer Janice Swinney, a
department spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Mayor Signs Order to Close Leaning Tower to Public</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Pisa signed an order Friday that will
close the Leaning Tower to the public from Jan. 7 to April 7 for
safety reasons.
   Mayor Giacomino Granchi said officials would at least consider
adopting safety measures that would allow a limited reopening of
the tower to the public.
   Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini has voiced concern about
its stability.
   The 180-foot tower began to tilt almost from the time Bonnano
Pisano started building it in 1173 because the ground shifted
underneath. It now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but
experts in Pisa said it would not topple for at least another
century if it continued at the same rate.
   The city stands to lose money from about 800,000 tourists a year
who pay $3.07 apiece to climb the tower.
   Prandini has said the government won't reimburse Pisa,
contending that visitors will still flock to see the tower and thus
the tourist industry won't suffer. He also guaranteed that the
government will pay for the restoration work, expected to cost
about $107.6 million.

   A Pakistani drug trafficker was

   Beheading is a punishment for murderers under the Islamic
Sharia, or religious law, by which Saudi Arabia rules. Thieves have
their hands chopped off and adulterers are stoned.
   In recent years, Islamic theologians prescribed beheading also
for those convicted of ``spreading corruption on the face of the

<HEAD>Charge Dropped After Prosecutor Withdraws DNA Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charges against a man accused of sexually
molesting a 5-year-old girl were thrown out after the accuracy of
DNA analysis, sometimes called genetic fingerprinting, was
questioned.
   The defense lawyer says the doubt raised about the reliability
of the DNA tests should trigger a re-examination of the use of such
tests in criminal prosecutions.
   ``This case opens up serious questions concerning dozens of
convictions and pleas across the country that are based on DNA
typing,'' said Gene R. Libby, attorney for a South Portland man in
a case involving the state's first use of genetic coding to
identify a suspect.
   A Cumberland County prosecutor withdrew the DNA evidence on
Sunday and charges against Kenneth McLeod alleging he committed a
sexual act with a 5-year-old girl were dropped.
   In seeking to block the use of the DNA evidence, Libby raised
questions about the techniques used by Lifecodes Corp. of Valhalla,
N.Y., to analyze the sample. Lifecodes, one of only three DNA
testing laboratories in the nation, deemed the DNA from semen that
was evidence of the molestation to be a match with DNA in a blood
sample taken from McLeod.
   But during a pre-trial hearing last week to decide whether to
admit the results as evidence, Dr. Michael Baird of Lifecodes
testified that the match was not precise because the DNA sample
from the semen was ``degraded'' from exposure to the elements.
   Karen Wexler, a spokeswoman for Lifecodes, defended the
company's procedures. ``We feel the technique is very reliable,''
she said.
   Deputy District Attorney Laurence Gadner declined to comment on
the case but indicated that his office would not rule out the use
of DNA typing in future prosecutions.
   ``What happened in the McLeod case is in no way a reflection on
the future of DNA testing, and any assertions to the contrary are
taking advantage of a unique situation,'' Gardner said.
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a complex molecule found
mainly in the nucleus of living cells and plays a vital role in
heredity. Because it contains genetic information unique to each
individual, it has been used by forensic researchers to positively
identify suspects in criminal cases.
   Developed in England, DNA typing was accepted as evidence for
the first time in this country last year in a criminal trial in
Florida. Since then, DNA evidence has been used in at least 100
criminal cases, mostly rape and murder prosecutions, in 23 states.
   Similar quality control problems at Lifecodes led a court in New
York to reject part of a DNA test as evidence in a murder trial
last year. Lifecodes subsequently said it had solved its quality
control problems.

   Wicked northwest winds whipped snow and arctic air into the
north-central states today, spawning subzero temperatures across
most of the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley and wind
chill indexes of 50 degrees below zero.
   Frigid temperatures were expected to continue this weekend as
massive arctic high pressure settled into the northern and central
Plains.
   At 11 p.m. Thursday, North Dakota wind chill indexes included 55
below in Fargo, 49 below in Jamestown and 43 below in Grand Forks.
   Wind chill factors are the combined effect of winds and chilling
temperatures on exposed skin. Advisories for dangerous wind chills
as cold as 60 below have been posted for much of Nebraska, Kansas
and Iowa today.
   In north-central Wyoming, it was snowing so hard in the Big Horn
Mountains that the Antelope Butte ski resort couldn't opened this
weekend as planned. Roads to the resort were blocked, preventing an
engineer from reaching the area for an annual inspection required
by the U.S. Forest Service, its owners said. Some 30 inches of snow
has fallen in the area.
   A winter storm warning was in effect for much of northern,
central and southeastern Wyoming today.
   A snow and blowing snow advisory was issued for the north and
central mountains in Colorado today after 18 inches of snow fell
near Vail Pass.
   Even more snow was expected in the already blanketed Great Lakes
region. A heavy snow warning was in effect for Lake Superior's
shoreline today.
   Six inches of new snow fell overnight in Wisconsin's Door
County, bringing the amount of accumulation since Wednesday to 30
inches.
   Heavy snow warnings were posted today for Michigan's western and
central Upper Peninsula, with up to 12 inches expected in isolated
areas. The 3 below recorded in Flint this morning broke a
26-year-old record low of minus 1.
   Advisories for snow and blowing snow have also been issued for
central Montana.
   Snow in the middle Mississippi Valley was expected to spread
into the Ohio Valley. In Missouri, the heaviest snow _ about 6
inches _ hit the St. Louis area, but Kansas City and Kirksville
were the coldest spots in the state with readings of 15 below and
14 below respectively.
   Lake snow advisories were issued for parts of western New York
state.
   A winter storm warning was in effect today for northern
Kentucky, the southern half of Indiana and southwest Ohio. A snow
advisory was issued for southeast Ohio and a winter storm watch was
posted for the northeastern part of the state.
   A winter storm warning was in effect today and tonight in West
Virginia's northern mountains.
   Peoria, Ill. broke an 88-year-old record for the date's coldest
temperature with 7 degrees. Other cities with record lows for the
date included Bismarck, N.D., 26; Buffalo, N.Y., 2; Rochester,
N.Y., 3; Rockford, Ill., 4, and Pensacola, Fla., 27.
   Temperatures Thursday warmed into the 70s across parts of
California and in extreme southern Texas.
   The nation's high was 79 at Spring Valley, Calif., and San Juan
Capistrano, Calif.

   Two former executives of Norden Systems
today admitted they conspired to obtain confidential Defense
Department bid information on a lucrative Marine Corps contract.
   James E. Rapinac, a former senior vice president, and C.J.
Richardson, a former marketing official, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy to defraud the government and convert government
property.
   The two acknowledged that they conspired in 1987 to pay defense
consultant Thomas Muldoon $49,500 to obtain the information about
the contract for a radar command and control system valued at up to
$150 million.
   Muldoon, who was convicted Thursday of participating in a
separate bribery scheme, obtained the information from fellow
defense consultant Mark Saunders, according to court papers filed
by prosecutors.
   Saunders, who has not been charged in the continuing
investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud, is alleged to have
obtained the bid information from former Navy procurement official
George Stone. Stone has not yet been charged in the investigation,
nicknamed Operation Ill Wind.
   The pleas by Rapinac and Richardson were accepted by U.S.
District Judge Claude M. Hilton, who scheduled sentencing for March
9. Both defendants could receive up to five years' imprisonment and
be fined as much as $250,000.
   In a statement, Rapinac said, ``While I offer no excuses for my
actions, I do believe the defense acquisition process is conducive
to abuses.''
   Earlier in the day, Hilton sentenced two former executives of
another defense firm, Whittaker Corp., on their guilty pleas to
bribery charges in an unrelated scheme.
   Scott M. Lamberth, 59, a former vice president of a Whittaker
subsidiary, was ordered to serve 10 months in prison and fined
$10,000 for his role in a scheme to funnel more than $80,000 to a
Pentagon procurement official.
   Also sentenced was John Franklin Van Tassel, a former Whittaker
employee, who received a three-month term in a halfway house for
his role in the scheme. Van Tassel, who headed the California-based
defense firm's Fayetteville, Ark., operation, was also fined $3,000.
   Both men had pleaded guilty Sept. 26 to bribery charges in
connection with a scheme to funnel money to former Marine Corps
contracting official Jack A. Sherman.
   The bribes were funneled through Muldoon, who was convicted
Thursday of eight charges, including bribery and conspiracy. Both
Lamberth and Van Tassel testified as prosecution witnesses against
Muldoon.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica acknowledged that both
men had cooperated with the government's investigation of Pentagon
procurement fraud, nicknamed ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   Aronica said Van Tassel played a minor role in the scheme.
Before he was sentenced, Lamberth urged Hilton to show leniency for
Van Tassel, who he said ``only acted as a good trouper who carried
out my orders.''
   Lamberth and Van Tassel were executives of Lee
Telecommunications, which was taken over by Whittaker in 1986.
Lamberth was a vice president and Van Tassel was head of
Whittaker's Arkansas operation.
   Van Tassel now lives in Colorado Springs, Colo., and Lamberth
lives near Durango, Colo.
   Another former Whittaker executive, Leonard Ingram, was
acquitted of all bribery and conspiracy charges against him by the
same jury that convicted Muldoon.
   The jury's verdict against Muldoon followed more than two days
of testimony, including tape recordings of wiretapped conversations
involving Muldoon, company officials and other defense consultants.
   Ingram testified he made repeated protests to Lamberth about the
bribery scheme but was told to mind his own business.
   Lamberth testified Ingram did object but later stopped. The
testimony was offered to try to convince jurors that Ingram
eventually acquiesced.
   ``Ill Wind blew itself out,'' Ingram's lawyer, Marcus Topel,
said after the verdict. ``In their zeal to broaden this
investigation, (prosecutors) put too much reliance on the
credibility of their informants.''
   Hilton scheduled Muldoon's sentencing for Feb. 16. He faces a
possible 70-year prison term and a maximum fine of $1.04 million.
   During the trial, Sherman testified he negotiated to receive
more than $80,000 worth of bribes in return for helping Lee
Telecommunications get Marine Corps electronic contracts.
   Sherman said Muldoon and two other defense consultants, who also
testified as government witnesses, served as conduits for the
payments. Muldoon and he split the bribe money, with Sherman taking
a third.
   Sherman, who is serving an 18-month prison term after pleading
guilty to a separate scheme, recalled receiving $25,000 from
Muldoon.
   Ingram, 51, of Huntsville, Ala., was a stockholder and vice
president of Lee Telecommunications. He became a vice president of
Whittaker Command and Control Systems after the 1986 takeover.
   The Whittaker subsidiary pleaded guilty to bribery and
conspiracy and paid $3.5 million in penalties.
   More than 25 individuals and four corporations have been
convicted in the continuing investigation.
   In the only other trial, a former Teledyne Electronics executive
was acquitted last spring during a trial at which two of his
colleagues were convicted for their roles in the influence-peddling
scandal.

<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker has proposed a $1 fine
for anyone who beats up a person who burns or desecrates American
or state flags.
   Rep. Joseph Petrarca, a Democrat, introduced the legislation
earlier this week.
   The $1 fine would replace the normal penalties for assault or
aggravated assault. A person convicted of aggravated assault could
be sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined $25,000.
   Petrarca said he offered the bill because the House was
unwilling to seek a constitutional amendment to punish flag burners.
   ``Since so many of our neighbors and family members have made
huge sacrifices to protect it on foreign battlefields, sometimes
with their lives, I feel desecrating the flag is a matter to be
taken extremely seriously,'' Petrarca said in a statement.
   The fate of the bill is uncertain.
   ``I can't imagine this is going to go anywhere,'' Rep. Allen
Kukovich, the Democrats' policy chairman, told The Philadelphia
Inquirer. ``But who knows? There are Philistines everywhere, I
guess.''
   Kukovich said such bills ``make the House of Representatives a
laughingstock.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush pressed ``the real thing'' when
he switched on the National Christmas Tree, spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Friday, but he hesitated when asked the same
question about former President Reagan.
   ``I better let that go,'' Fitzwater said when asked if Reagan
had used a phony button in the years that he lit the tree from the
safety of a White House balcony, several hundred yards from the
tree.
   ``Is your non-answer an answer?'' he was asked.
   ``Well, sort of,'' responded Fitzwater, who served as press
spokesman to Reagan before taking on the same assignment with Bush.
   Asked about this year's ceremony, Fitzwater asserted without
hesitation: ``Last night was the real thing.''
   Bush lit the 35-foot national tree on Thursday night in person
at a public outdoor ceremony on the Ellipse. During his eight years
in office, Reagan stayed within the White House complex for the
ceremony, supposedly lighting the Christmas tree by remote control.
   Fitzwater was pressed about speculation that the button Reagan
pushed each year was not attached to anything, and that a National
Park Service officer actually lit the tree from the site.
   ``I think that's a question for Mark Weinberg,'' Fitzwater said,
referring to the current press spokesman in Reagan's California
office.
   However, Weinberg made it clear he didn't want to get into
details of the situation.
   ``All I know is when the president pushed the button, the tree
lighted up,'' Weinberg said in a telephone interview.

psychiatric clinics, if necessary on the basis of a resolution
passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations.
   This proposal involves no intervention in the internal affairs
of any country. After all, it would apply to every country on the
same basis, to the Soviet Union, to Indonesia, to Chile, to the
Republic of South Africa, to Spain, Brazil and to every other
country.
   Since the protection of human rights has been proclaimed in the
United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, this cannot for this
reason be said to be a matter of purely internal or domestic
concern. In order to achieve this great goal, no exertions are too
great, however long the road may seem.

   I am profoundly convinced that it would be better to liberate a
certain number of people, even though they may be guilty of some
offense or other, than to keep thousands of innocent people locked
up and exposed to torture.
   We need reform, not revolution. We need a pliant, pluralist,
tolerant community which selectively and tentatively can bring
about a free, undogmatic use of the experiences of all social
systems.

   Eighteen trade-union activists were arrested
Friday outside the White House when they blocked a gate during a
peaceful protest over the deaths of labor leaders in El Salvador.
   Maj. William Spruill of the U.S. Park Police said the
demonstrators were charged with demonstrating without a permit, a
misdemeanor. Their permit was revoked when they sat down on the
frigid Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk and blocked the gate, Spruill
said.
   The protesters, demanding a cutoff of U.S. aid to El Salvador,
said more than 100 trade unionists had been abducted and killed in
a wave of violence that began Oct. 31 with a bombing at the
National Salvadoran Union Workers Federation headquarters. Ten
people died in that explosion.
   A statement issued by the demonstrators said those arrested
included: Michael Urquhart, president of the American Federation of
Government Employees Local 12; David Schlein, the AFGE national
vice president for the Washington metro area; Mark Simon, president
of the Montgomery County Education Association; and Paul Pinsky, a
member of the Maryland House of Delegates and former president of
the Prince George's County Educators' Association.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Andrei D. Sakharov shared
little personally except a mutual respect and a commitment to
change.
   As they went before the nation in a parliamentary session this
week, they could not have appeared more different: Gorbachev, at
the pinnacle of his power, was robust and self-confident; Sakharov
was stooped and stammering.
   And yet, the times dictated that they work together, and it was
Sakharov's relationship to the Soviet president that defined his
role in an era of reform.
   It was a sign of the program of change that Sakharov long had
urged and Gorbachev instituted that Soviets could watch the two men
struggle with each other at the Congress of People's Deputies
parliament.
   Sakharov died Thursday evening in his study, preparing to
challenge Gorbachev once more on the political supremacy of the
Communist Party that Gorbachev leads.
   ``It's a great loss,'' Gorbachev said Friday during a break in
the Congress of People's Deputies, where Sakharov had served as a
parliamentarian. ``During this time of perestroika, Academician
Sakharov had his mission, his role, and that we all understood. He
was a man of conviction and sincerity. He was not some sort of
political intriguer.''
   The Soviet public liked and respected Sakharov at least as much
as Gorbachev. An unscientific poll conducted by the weekly
Arguments and Facts in October found Sakharov the country's most
popular politician, more popular than Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev freed Sakharov from the exile in the industrial city
of Gorky imposed by Leonid I. Brezhnev, and withdrew Soviet
soldiers from Afghanistan. It was Sakharov's criticism of the
intervention into Afghanistan 10 years ago that led to his exile in
Gorky.
   Even though Sakharov owed his return to Moscow from the living
hell of isolation, force-feedings and surveillance in Gorky,
Gorbachev never dominated Sakharov.
   Sakharov spoke out in favor of the reforms Gorbachev instituted
because they matched his own ideals, but in the past several months
had become increasingly critical of the pace of the reform and
Gorbachev's accumulation of power.
   He said the country had no alternative to Gorbachev's leadership
but prodded the Soviet president to push harder. The day he died,
he told a group of like-minded deputies that the Soviet
leadership's hesitancy to press more radical reform was leading the
country to catastrophe.
   Sakharov told the first Congress in June:``I personally respect
Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev very much, but it is dangerous to
give so much power even to the initiator of perestroika.''
   Sakharov continually challenged Gorbachev at the Congress, but
was no match as a public speaker to the vigorous and self-confident
president. Sakharov stammered, rambled and spoke in a high-pitched
voice, often losing his audience even when it supported him.
   He often pressed issues that a smarter politician would have
left alone. Deputies hounded him in June for allegations that the
Soviet military had hunted down and killed its own soldiers in
Afghanistan rather than risk their captured by rebels.
   In recently released excerpts of a book to be published next
year, Sakharov said that Gorbachev usually greeted him with a smile
that was ``half-kindly, half-condescending.''
   Even when Gorbachev tried to silence him, Sakharov insisted on
being heard.
   Their last exchange was shown to millions of Soviets on live TV
on Tuesday, the opening day of the Congress' winter session.
   Gorbachev granted Sakharov the right to speak after having
denied it to a previous deputy, but cut him off abruptly when he
began challenging the Communist Party's grip on power.
   Sakharov handed Gorbachev a stack of telegrams in support of his
position, and the Soviet leader retorted: ``You come to me, I will
give you three files of telegrams.''
   Even though Gorbachev called Sakharov in exile in December 1986
to tell him he could return to Moscow, the two did not meet until
more than a year later, Jan. 15, 1988.
   Typically, Sakharov handed Gorbachev a list of 200 prisoners
still held for their political beliefs.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers controlled by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega today named him head of the government and granted
him sweeping powers, saying they took the action to confront a
``state of war'' because of U.S. sanctions.
   The unanimous resolution by the 510-member People's Assembly,
which the Defense Forces chief picked, said Noreiga was being
designated ``maximum leader for national liberation.''
   The move formally gives Noriega greater powers than provisional
President Francisco Rodriguez, a situation that already existed de
facto.
   Several thousand Noriega supporters surrounded the assembly as
it met and cheered as the resolution passed.
   ``The Republic of Panama is declared to be in a state of war
while the aggression lasts,'' said the resolution. ``To confront
this aggression, the job of chief of government of Panama is hereby
created, and Manuel Antonio Noriega is designated to carry out
these responsibilities as maximum leader for national liberation.''
   The resolution gave Noriega the power to appoint public
officials, control foreign relations, convoke the assembly, and
``make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseen
circumstance that affect the national life and the interests of the
country.''
   Asked about the move, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger told reporters in Washington, ``This ia charade and
nonsense. As far as we are concerned, at least, there is no
government in Panama anyway.
   Isaac Chandeck, a delegate from the Panama City suburb of Ancon,
predicted Thursday that the assembly would give Noriega the post.
   Rodriguez, a Noriega friend since high school, was picked as
president after Noriega halted vote-counting in a popular election
in May, backed the general for the new post Thursday.
   Noriega annulled returns from the May 7 vote when they showed
the opposition winning by a landslide. The move also blocked the
election of a new National Assembly, so Noriega picked a new
legislative body.
   Noriega is wanted in the United States on federal
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The United States
has been trying to oust him with economic sanctions and diplomatic
pressure.
   Rodriguez told the assembly Thursday that the United States had
``declared war on all Panamanians'' with its economic sanctions.
   ``It is not Noriega they want to do away with,'' Rodriguez said.
``They want to do away with our national capacity to be
independent.''
   Noriega has weathered more than a year of the sanctions,
opposition demonstrations and two attempted coups from inside the
Defense Forces.
   As chief executive, Noriega would hold the same title as that of
dictator Omar Torrijos, who negotiated treaties with the United
States to transfer the Panama Canal to Panamanian control at the
end of the century and close down U.S. military installations.
   Noriega says the United States is trying to force his ouster
because it wants to renege on the treaties.
   In another move against the United States, Chandeck said he will
be distributing ``wanted'' posters for two U.S. generals.
   Chandeck has filed charges of destroying Panamanian property
against Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of U.S. Army South; and Gen.
Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command that includes
all U.S. military forces in Latin America.
   The generals were charged in Ancon, Chandeck's constituency.
They were accused of destroying public property by driving armored
personnel carriers on public roads and by other actions.
   The U.S. military twice rejected court summons for Cisneros and
Thurman. U.S. officials offered in one letter the ``courtesy'' of
facilitating ``the transfer of custody of selected fugitives
pending drug-trafficking charges in the United States.'' That was a
reference to Noriega and the charges against him.
   Borough officials did not respond to the tongue-in-cheek offer.
Instead, they issued an arrest warrant for Cisneros and Thurman.
Chandeck said he now plans to distribute ``wanted'' posters of
Cisneros and Thurman all over the country.
   ``We will have their pictures and a big `wanted' sign on top,''
he said.

   Ignoring demonstrators chanting ``Shame! Shame!
Shame!'' the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted Friday to
raise its bus and subway fares 15 cents to $1.15.
   In addition to the first subway fare hike in four years, the MTA
board approved increases averaging 15 percent for the commuter
trains and express buses that serve the city's outer boroughs and
suburbs.
   ``No one likes a fare increase, but it does cost money to get
things done,'' explained MTA Chairman Robert Kiley. ``Service is
getting better.''
   The average fare increase of 15 percent compared favorably with
a 22 percent increase in the cost of living since the last hike, he
said.
   Dozens of protesters, including a contingent of Guardian Angels,
circled outside the MTA offices in Manhattan. Inside, the board's
session was punctuated by shouts of ``You'r stealing food out of
people's mouths!'' and ``Let the people vote on the fare!''
   When board member Herbert J. Libert asked Kiley if the
demonstrators could be quieted, Kiley replied: ``This will be a
test of your attention span, Herb.''
   Guards threw one sign-carrying demonstrator out of the room
after he approached the table where board members were sitting.
   The new fares take effect Jan. 1.
   The TA had proposed boosting bus and subway fares to $1.25 with
discount packages of 18 tokens for $20, but that was hooted down at
public hearings.
   Connecticut officials said this week they would veto the fare
increase for Metro-North trains running from that state into New
York.
   ``If Connecticut fails to make us whole, we would put on a level
of service (for Connecticut) that would reflect that,'' Kiley said.
   He said about $7.7 million in cuts for Connecticut service would
be necessary if state officials persist in their veto and refuse to
increase the state's direct subsidy to Metro-North Commuter
Railroad.
   The new fares include increasing Long Island Rail Road and
Metro-North fares 15 percent to 20 percent. An off-peak, 10-trip
ticket will be sold at 10 percent off the regular fare, and there
will be off-peak ``family fares'' under which children riding with
a parent pay 50 cents a ride. The $1 penalty for buying tickets on
the train will be increased to $2.

   Proof that peace is breaking out all
over comes this weekend with the inspection of a top-secret ``Star
Wars'' laser lab by Soviet scientists.
   The Soviets won't be shown everything, as much of the project
remains secret. The Pentagon described the visit as a trial to
evaluate a proposed space defense treaty.
   The ``confidence-building'' tours are designed to show how
inspections of Strategic Defense Initiative research facilities
would work under the treaty recently proposed by the United States
in Geneva, the Pentagon said.
   ``The visit will offer Soviet experts an opportunity to see how
one of the U.S.-proposed measures, visits to laboratories, would
work in practice,'' the Pentagon said. Other proposals include data
exchanges and observation of tests.
   Ten scientists, led by Ambassador Yuri Nazarkin, head of the
Soviet delegation to the Nuclear and Space Talks, will be briefed
Saturday at the TRW plant regarding the planned space-based
anti-missile system, Pentagon officials said.
   The delegation will visit a second SDI research facility at Los
Alamos, N.M., on Monday and Tuesday the Pentagon said.
   The Soviets were scheduled to arrive Friday at El Toro Marine
Corps Air Station north of San Clemente. Ambassador David J. Smith,
chief U.S. negotiator for the Nuclear and Space Talks, will
accompany the delegation.
   At the TRW lab near San Clemente the Soviets will investigate
the Alpha laser facility. It is the centerpiece of the Zenith Star
project, which the Pentagon hopes will prove the viability of using
space-based lasers to shoot down hostile missiles or satellites.
   The hydrogen fluoride laser uses high-combustion fuels to create
energy, which then is amplified by mirrors and resonant chambers
intended to create a concentrated beam of light capable of
destroying vehicles in space.
   Zenith Star is the name for a 50-ton, 80-foot-long carrier for
the Alpha laser.
   In Los Alamos, the Soviet team will be briefed on the evolution
of U.S. work on Neutral Particle Beam technology, the Pentagon said.
   The scientists will view the BEAR Neutral Particle beam payload
which was launched into space and recovered in July 1989, and also
will see the device operate in the lab.

<TEXT>
   A county commissioner and three others were
convicted of illegally making and selling equipment used to
descramble pay-TV channels, a case a defense attorney said was the
first of its type in the nation.
   Dale County Commissioner Billy Clyde Herring and his brother,
Bennie Dean Herring, were convicted Thursday of three counts each
of conspiracy to manufacture, assemble, possess and sell video
deciphers modified to receive scrambled television signals on
premium pay channels without authorization.
   The Herring brothers and two others were convicted under a 1968
federal wiretap law that was amended by Congress in 1986 to include
electronic communications.
   Defense Attorneys George Beck and Jim Parkman said their clients
sold the devices openly and did not know the amended wiretap law
applied to descrambling. The defense contended the law was intended
to apply to bugging devices, not satellite transmission receivers.
   A new federal law, which went on the books in January,
specifically covers descrambling. The four were charged with
selling descrambling equipment in December 1987 and June 1988,
before the new anti-descrambling law was passed.
   Beck said the prosecution was the first against descrambling of
pay-TV channels using the federal wiretap law. U.S. Attorney Jim
Wilson could not confirm that, but said it is one of the first.
   ``We're naturally disappointed with the verdict,'' Beck said.
``We don't think the defendants had sufficient notice that what
they are accused of was a violation of the wiretap statute.''
   In addition to the Herrings' convictions, Ron Mills, 39, of
Goshen was convicted of two counts of conspiracy and Dee Dee Bell,
35, of Ariton was convicted of one count. Bennie Herring owns
Tri-State Satellite in Brundidge, and the other three worked for
him.
   U.S. District Judge Truman Hobbs did not set a sentencing date.
The four remain free on $5,000 bond apiece. Each defendant could
get up to five years in prison and fined $250,000 on each count.
   Dale County Commission Chairman Curt Head said state law
requires that Billy Herring step down from his post. Gov. Guy Hunt
will appoint a successor to finish the term, he said.

<HEAD>County Proposal Would Halt Growth In Nation's Hottest Housing Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King County officials are considering a proposal
that could bring growth in the nation's hottest housing market to a
grinding halt.
   The proposal, unveiled Thursday by County Councilman Ron Sims,
would block housing construction in unincorporated King County
until after adequate roads, schools and other services are built.
   Sims and co-sponsor Councilwoman Cynthia Sullivan said the
proposal aims to shift the power to make land use decisions to the
public, essentially giving them veto rights over developments if
their neighborhoods are being overwhelmed by growth.
   In May, Seattle voters adopted limits on downtown growth in one
of the city's first demonstrations of discontent with the fast pace
of development.
   If the county council approves the measure, it would put an
amendment of the council's charter on the Nov. 6, 1990, general
election ballot.
   The proposed amendment reads: ``No county officials shall have
the authority to approve private development where facilities will
not be adequate, unless an emergency is found to exist.''
   That would eliminate the discretion county officials have to
approve development plans when services are not in place.
   Sims listed roads, sewers, water, schools, open space and
surface water drainage as key services that would have to be in
place before ground is broken for a project.
   ``We're taking away the permissiveness that has allowed growth
to occur before we have the infrastructure to support it,'' Sims
said. He said he would formally introduce the ordinance at Monday's
council meeting.
   A simple majority on the nine-member council is needed for
approval.
   ``What it does is require communities to `pay as they grow' and
that's something we've been promoting for over a year,'' said newly
elected council member Brian Derdowski, a slow-growth activist.
   Developers criticized the measure as a ``poorly drafted''
ordinance that fails to define what is adequate service.
   ``If this ordinance passes, (housing) prices will skyrocket,''
said Bill Sherman, president of the Seattle Master Builders
Association.
   Sims said a later ordinance would define which services would be
included and what would be considered adequate.
   The measure comes as the median cost of a single-family home in
the Seattle area is rising at 23.7 percent a year, up from $88,900
to $110,000 in the past year, the fastest pace in the nation,
according to the National Association of Realtors.
   The population is also swelling, with an estimated 650,000 more
people expected by 2020.
   The 2,128-square-mile county has about 1.4 million residents,
about 31 percent of Washington state's population. Incorporated
areas include Seattle and its suburbs, with a total of about 1
million people. Much of the eastern part of the county is
unincorporated.
   The county has grown by about 190,000 people during the past
decade, with newcomers accounting for about half the increase.
   Seattle was named the nation's most liveable city this year by
the Places Rated Almanac, in part because of its affordable real
estate.

   The writer was an Associated Press correspondent
in Moscow during the height of Andrei D. Sakharov's dissident
activities in the 1970s.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS KENT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrei D. Sakharov remained free during his toughest years as a
dissident because he held a unique position in Soviet society that
stymied official attempts to silence or expel him.
   Because of his top-level scientific reputation and the huge
support he received from the West, authorities feared that jailing
Sakharov could threaten Kremlin leader Leonid I. Brezhnev's
struggle to forge a 1970s detente with the United States.
   Soviet authorities sometimes dealt with troublesome dissidents
by expelling them from the country. But because Sakharov was a key
developer of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, the security-obsessed
bureaucracy couldn't imagine that course, either. Once abroad,
officials feared, Sakharov could divulge critical Soviet nuclear
secrets.
   Meanwhile, the honors Sakharov won for his scientific work and
his membership in the Soviet Academy of Sciences gave him
privileges that set him far apart from other dissidents, who were
often impoverished and little-known.
   Foreign visitors, including parliament members and diplomats,
came frequently to Sakharov's apartment in a prestigious area of
downtown Moscow. As a result of his academy membership, the
physicist enjoyed a hefty salary and the use of chauffeured cars,
even as he suffered surveillance by the KGB and vilification in the
official press.
   Yet the threatening police presence around him and the official
denunciations still put pressures on Sakharov that required
substantial personal courage. His colleagues in the Academy of
Sciences frequently castigated him in public, although they never
voted him out of membership, and he often received threatening
letters.
   And he never knew when his espousing of human rights and
environmental causes might lead to the abrupt end of his
privileges, and his fall into the world of brutal repression where
many other dissidents lived.
   Until he was banished to the city of Gorky in 1980, suffering
many of the horrors that other dissidents faced, Sakharov's special
status made it natural for him to become a central figure in the
dissident movement in Moscow. Dissidents felt that if they could
only contact Sakharov and get him to speak for them, they would
acquire a measure of safety from persecution.
   Sakharov in reality could offer them little protection, but he
rarely failed to welcome them. Dissidents from all over the nation,
sometimes 15 or 20 at a time, squeezed into his two-room apartment
on Chkalova Street in Moscow to beseech him for help, and to meet
with Western reporters.
   The book-lined, disorderly apartment was usually filled with the
smell of tea brewing in the kitchen. As many as seven members of
the Sakharov family, who slept at night on sofas and the floor,
milled around with the visiting dissidents, foreign camera crews
and foreign supporters.
   Yelena Bonner, Sakharov's outspoken wife, presided over the
chaos, sometimes giving interviews herself or jumping in to answer
a question asked of Sakharov.
   The telephone rang constantly. Authorities at times cut off his
international phone service, but Sakharov usually was able to make
and receive calls within Moscow and often relayed messages from one
dissident to another. Sakharov's mail service functioned, too,
bringing him as many as 20 appeals for help a week from dissidents
throughout the Soviet Union.
   Sakharov believed the mail was read and the phone calls
monitored by authorities, but felt he had little to fear because he
made no secret of his dissident activities.
   Along with his Academy of Sciences salary of 530 rubles a month
_ nearly three times that of the average Soviet worker _ Sakharov
had other privileges stemming from his three ``Hero of the Soviet
Union'' awards for his scientific work. By showing a special card,
he could ride buses and subways for free, get priority airline and
train tickets and go to the head of lines at stores and theaters.
   He traveled occasionally, sometimes attending the trials of
dissidents in other cities.
   Yet despite his special status, Sakharov suffered many
pressures. Frail in appearance, he often seemed stung and
despairing after a new press attack or a threatening, anonymous
phone call. When he visited a foreign diplomat or journalist, KGB
agents would tail him by car. There were rumors the neighbors in
his apartment building had been recruited to spy on him.
   Yet Sakharov never seemed interested in leaving the country or
toning down his dissident activities.
   ``I have never considered emigrating. Not for one minute. It
never entered my head,'' he said in 1977, the year President Jimmy
Carter sent him a strong letter of support that gave him a new
measure of safety.
   Sakharov's freedom did not last indefinitely. In 1980, the
authorities finally stripped him of his official honors and then
exiled him for six years to Gorky, a city closed to foreigners.
There, Sakharov was almost entirely isolated from the outside world
and subjected to a far higher level of threats and harassment than
he ever experienced in Moscow. Sakharov staged hunger strikes in
protest. The authorities responded with painful force-feeding.
   According to his wife, a doctor in Gorky once told him: ``We
won't let you die, but we will make you an invalid.''
   But the state never jailed him and never expelled him from the
scientific community _ an enduring sign of Sakharov's special role
in Soviet life.

   Some Americans and other foreigners
are considering leaving and would-be visitors are canceling trips
amid fears of terrorism following the failed bid to overthrow
President Corazon Aquino.
   ``It's a very critical situation,'' said a travel agent who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``If this goes on, Americans will
leave this country. The rebels have accomplished what they would
want to do _ create panic.''
   U.S. diplomats say there has been no exodus of foreigners, who
included about 100,000 Americans, since mutineers in the military
staged a nine-day coup attempt that started Dec. 1.
   But rumors of a new attempt are sweeping the city. Travel agents
and other sources in the foreign community say many foreigners have
lost confidence in the Aquino government and plan to leave if the
situation deteriorates.
   Travel agents said they are swamped with requests for open-dated
airline tickets from worried foreigners as well as wealthy
Filipinos. None of the agents wanted to be quoted by name for fear
of being accused of hurting the travel industry.
   ``Wealthy Filipinos are more scared. They are frantic,'' said an
American travel agent. ``Americans are a little bit more sturdy.
They are not leaving now but they are preparing to leave. They want
to be able to get out of the airport until they feel danger is
over.''
   The recent coup attempt shook the foreign community more than
the previous five during the Aquino administration because much of
the fighting occurred in Makati, the financial district where
thousands of foreigners live.
   Hundreds of tourists and business travelers, including at least
164 Americans, were trapped for four days during fierce fighting in
the district.
   Also, President Bush's decision to order U.S. war jets to
support government troops raised fears of reprisals against
Americans. On Thursday, unidentified assailants fired two grenades
into a U.S. government housing area. The attack caused no injuries
but reinforced fears that foreigners were no longer safe.
   ``They are not very happy with the situation,'' another travel
agent said. ``They worry that there's going to be a coup, there's
not going to be one, (there will be) terrorist attacks. They feel
they are not very safe going out into the streets or shopping. They
feel very insecure.''
   Although careful not to play up the strains, the U.S. Embassy
has made available ``stress counseling'' for those either shaken by
the coup attempt or nervous about the possibility of another one.
   Some people have left temporarily for Hong Kong or other
neigboring countries, but travel agents are not overjoyed by the
extra business.
   ``It's not the kind of business I like because if they leave for
good, then it would pull business downward,'' said one travel
agent. ``If they get too panicky that means a loss of corporate
revenues.''
   U.S. officials have been reviewing their procedures for helping
American nationals leave the country in case of an emergency.
Several other expatriate organizations, including the
Philippine-American Chamber of Commerce, have set up networks to
keep foreigners informed of the situation.
   Meanwhile, tourist officials say would-be visitors are canceling
trips.
   Tourism Secretary Peter Garrucho said the travel industry may
lose up to $550 million in gross earnings next year because of
estimates that up to 500,000 prospective tourists will travel
elsewhere.
   One travel agent said 500 of 6,000 delegates who earlier
confirmed they would attend an international medical convention
here in February already have backed out.
   Hotel managers, who had been turning away guests a month ago,
said occupancy in some five-star establishments has dropped as low
as 29 percent.
   Occupancy at the country's most luxurious hotels, Manila Hotel
and Westin Philippine Plaza, has dropped by 50 percent, managers
said.

   Stripping in the aisles of Filene's Basement, an
intricate art perfected by die-hard bargain hunters over the years,
will pass into history when the store builds women's dressing rooms
in February.
   The state announced Friday that the store had agreed to build
the dressing rooms in response to two complaints filed with the
state's Commission Against Discrimination.
   Filene's Basement has long had a nationwide reputation as a
place for savvy shoppers to stop on tours of the historic city. The
store's fame was augmented during the 1988 presidential campaign,
when voters learned candidate Gov. Michael S. Dukakis bought his
suits there.
   But the store has no changing rooms for women, although men have
dressing rooms.
   Jeanne-Marie Cabe, one of the women who lodged a complaint, said
Friday she was outraged when she learned men had a place to change,
while women had to wriggle in and out of clothes in the aisles.
   One Christmas, she had to return a number of items that didn't
fit. ``I was really getting mad waiting in line and thinking men
don't have to do this,'' said Cabe.
   She filed her complaint in 1988, two years after Janet Boyle
Hugill brought her complaint.
   Hugill also was surprised to learn men had a dressing room. She
filed her complaint after trying to buy a bathing suit. It was not
returnable, so she couldn't take it home to try on. An employee
told her about the facilities for men.
   ``I had no idea there were men's dressing rooms,'' she said.
``Obviously, I thought that was not right.''
   MCAD Commissioner Kathleen Allen, whose office worked out the
agreement with Filene's Basement, said she has friends who refuse
to shop at the store because there's no place to try on clothes.
   ``I don't know why anyone has not filed a complaint before,''
Allen said. ``It's one of those insults women maybe thought they
had to ignore, and move onto the next place.''
   Filene's Basement Inc., based in Boston, has 25 stores in the
Northeast, said Jim Anathan, the company's president. All the other
stores have changing rooms for women.
   The Boston store once had a changing room that was removed to
make way for customers and merchandise. ``We really found we
couldn't accommodate the velocity and the traffic down there,''
Anathan said.
   He pointed out the new room will be small _ only about 140
square feet. ``It's probably going to create more problems for us
than solutions,'' he said.
   An informal survey of women combing the racks at Filene's on
Friday elicited cries of ``Wonderful!'' from basement patrons.
   Kay Smith, a Filene's Basement shopper for 25 years, said she
won't miss the changing technique she has perfected over the years.
   ``You pick up a raincoat _ if you haven't worn a coat _ and
change under that without a bit of skin showing,'' Smith said.
   The news even brought sighs of relief from men, including one
who is used to the sight of women in various states of undress.
   Tony Maccarro, a bartender at a Boston striptease club who was
buying bluejeans for his daughter, said he finds it embarrassing to
see women changing in the aisles. ``There's certain things for
certain places,'' he said.

<HEAD>Trident 2 Missile Back on Target With Third Successful Test</HEAD>

   The crew of the nuclear-powered
submarine Tennessee successfully launched its third Trident 2
missile in 11 days Friday, freeing up $950 million that Congress
had withheld from the program because of early test failures.
   The success also put the Navy's newest, deadliest weapon on
track for operational deployment at sea in March.
   ``A nice, safe, easy launch straight down through the
countdown,'' said Vice Adm. Roger F. Bacon, commander of the
Atlantic Submarine Fleet, who observed the test 50 miles off the
Florida coast.
   Bacon said the launch demonstrated that engineers have overcome
nozzle design problems that caused the explosive failure of two of
the first three undersea tests in March and August.
   Because of the failures, Congress froze all but $250 million of
the $l.2 billion appropriated for the Trident 2 program in fiscal
year 1990. Congress stipulated the funds would be released when the
Navy logged three successes of the redesigned missile.
   That requirement was met when the third straight success was
registered Friday, said Lt. Greg Smith, Navy spokesman.
   Three more submarine test-firings are planned in January and
February before the Tennessee goes on operational patrol with 24 of
the powerful missiles, each capable of delivering as many as 12
nuclear wearheads to individual targets, Bacon said.
   Twenty-four Trident 2 submarines are planned.
   The two early failures set the program back, missing the
original November operational date. March was set as the new target
after the faulty nozzle system was redesigned.
   Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters were not on the scene Friday
as the submerged submarine unleashed the 44-foot, $26.5-million
missile, which propelled a dummy warhead package to an undisclosed
ocean target more than 4,000 miles down the Atlantic tracking range.
   A large Greenpeace vessel was badly damaged Dec. 4 when a Navy
ship rammed it to keep it out of the launch safety zone. A smaller
sailboat kept its distance as the protesters staged a silent vigil
during a launch Wednesday.
   Shannon Fagan, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, said the organization
now would take its fight to Congress in an effort to kill the
Trident 2 program.

   A decisive election victory gives the new
civilian government vital leverage on Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who
will keep command of the army after leaving the presidency, but the
road ahead is not smooth.
   President-elect Patricio Aylwin acknowledges he must build
careful alliances with conservatives to achieve democratic reforms
sought by his center-left alliance.
   Also, Pinochet appears at least indirectly strengthened in his
claim to leadership of the politial right.
   Aylwin won 55.2 percent of the vote for president Thursday,
nearly twice the 29.4 percent of pro-government candidate Hernan
Buchi. A third candidate, entrepreneur Francisco Errazuriz, got
only 15.4 percent, according to virtually complete returns released
Friday.
   The 17-party coalition Aylwin represents won a majority in the
120-member House of Deputies and 22 of the 38 elected Senate seats.
The consitution Pinochet's government wrote in 1980, however,
allows it to appoint up to 10 more senators.
   His own impressive victory, and the especially good showing of
his Christian Demcratic Party give Aylwin ``a strong mandate,''
said Arturo Valenzuela, Latin American studies director at
Georgetown University in Washington.
   Thursday's vote demonstrates that ``Aylwin has broad-based
support, which Pinochet does not,'' Valenzuela said in an interview
in Santiago, where he witnessed the election. ``He can say: `Look,
I got 55 percent. You only got 43 percent.'''
   Pinochet won 43 percent of the vote in October 1988 on a
referendum proposal to extend his presidency to 1997.
   He lost the referendum and was forced to call the elections, but
Pinochet's showing was much stronger than Buchi's in the
presidential race.
   ``For the right, Pinochet is the most powerful figure,
potentially,'' Valenzuela said.
   The fiercely anti-communist general, 74, seized power in 1973,
overthrowing elected President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist
who died in the coup. He is to relinquish the presidency March 11,
but has said he will remain as commander of the 60,000-man army.
   A special clause in the constitution allows him to keep the job
until 1998. From the army command, directly across Santiago's main
boulevard from the presidential palace, he plans to lead the
military in its role as watchdog of his 1980 constitution.
   Pinochet also has hinted occasionally that he may return to
politics _ because, the general says, Chileans will come to miss
his authoritarian leadership.
   Aylwin's platform includes several democratic changes in the
constitution and in special laws, but majorities of up to
two-thirds are needed to pass them.
   That his coalition failed to achieve such dominance is due
largely to complicated electoral laws written by the junta that
caused many leftist candidates to lose even when they got more
votes than rightist opponents.
   Parties of the left have considerable influence in powerful
labor groups, and Aylwin will need to make sure they do not feel
disenfranchized as he tries to reach accommodation with
conservatives.
   At a news conference Friday, the president-elect seemed well
aware of his delicate position. He denied any intention of setting
his Christian Democrats apart from the alliance as a means of
wooing moderate rightists known to dislike Pinochet.
   The alliance will continue to work ``as a team,'' Aylwin said,
and he will follow a ``path of broad consensus'' between now and
March 11.
   He spoke of the peaceful manner in which Chileans are returning
to civilian government, and declared: ``In this country, the
commitment toward moderation prevails.''

<TEXT>
   Twenty-three Koreans on Friday were
tearfully reunited with their relatives after arriving from the
Soviet island of Sakhalin, where Japan sent them to work during
World War II.
   The Koreans, ranging in age from 57 to 83, hugged relatives and
shed tears when they arrived at Seoul's Kimpo International Airport
for their first visit. They are among thousands sent to labor on
Sakhalin when the island was under Japanese control. The Soviets
took it over in the closing days of the war in 1945, when Korea was
liberated from Japan's colonial rule.
   This was the first batch of Koreans on Sakhalin who have visited
South Korea under a program initiated in July by South Korean and
Japanese Red Cross officials.
   The 23 Koreans will return to the Soviet territory after winding
up an officially-sponsored two-week stay in South Korea.
   About 4,000 Korean wartime survivors live on the island, in
addition to more than 30,000 Sakhalin Koreans of the second or
third generation.
   South Korea had urged the Soviet Union to establish official
channels to help the Koreans on Sakhalin visit their homeland since
the communist superpower permitted limited home visits by the
Sakhalin Koreans in 1986.
   Although South Korea has no diplomatic relations with the Soviet
Union, the two countries have sharply improved trade and other
relations in recent years.
   Sakhalin, a narrow 580-mile-long island, lies about 40 miles
north of Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and straddles the
Soviet mainland.

   The White House suggested Friday that
continued Soviet adherence to ``a centralized planning course''
could jeopardize some economic incentives President Bush offered
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater cited recent criticism
in the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies of Gorbachev's
perestroika _ or restructuring _ and moves toward keeping multiyear
planning methods.
   ``We're disappointed that they appear to be on a centralized
planning course,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush outlined ``a number of economic opportunities for the
Soviet Union'' when he met earlier this month with Gorbachev at
Malta, including a promise to support Moscow's bid for observer
status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, an
international organization that establishes trading rules,
Fitzwater said.
   ``A good deal of the progress under those initiatives requires
that they move toward market pricing ... toward market economics,
'' Fitzwater said. ``This is not particularly encouraging for their
participation in world economic bodies. And, so, we are
disappointed.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday signed into law new
rules for the scandal-wracked Department of Housing and Urban
Development, saying the regulations will help eliminate flaws that
allowed the agency to be ``abused for political purposes or
personal gain.''
   The legislation, approved by a voice vote in both the Senate and
House, grew out of revelations of fraud, influence-peddling and
political favoritism at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   The multibillion-dollar scandal has been the subject of
congressional and criminal investigations.
   Bush said the measure would ``improve program management and
financial accountability at HUD and make that department's programs
less susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse and political influence.''
   The bill requires consultants and lobbyists working on HUD
programs to register with the department and identify their clients
and fees they receive. Recipients of HUD grants would have to
report their use of consultants and lobbyists.
   HUD would be required to publish notices of funding
availability, including waivers of regulations as a way to prevent
subsidy awards based on insider information. The measure also
imposes strict limitations on the use of discretionary funds by HUD.
   Bush said in a statement that ``never again must we let'' the
programs of HUD or any other agency be ``abused for political
purposes or personal gain.''
   The law, he said, ``represents a bispartisan approach to
correcting many of HUD's past problems and helping to ensure that
in the future that department will better serve those who depend on
its programs.''
   Other provisions:
   _Create a HUD chief financial officer's position, as well as a
comptroller of the Federal Housing Administration, to oversee
financial management.
   _Apply new restrictions on the Section 8 moderate rehabilitation
program, which provided subsidies for renovating low-income housing
that were at the heart of evidence of influence-peddling and
political favoritism in the HUD scandals.
   _Make it illegal for consultants to sell their influence in
securing housing subsidies for a contingent fee or a per-unit fee,
as occurred during the Reagan administration.
   _Strengthen the secretary's ability to enforce new HUD laws with
civil fines against developers, consultants, applicants and
mortgage lenders. It would restrict the secretary's ability to use
discretion in awarding housing assistance.

   An arson blaze this morning on the first
floor of a high-rise for the elderly pumped smoke into upper
floors, killing three people out of reach of firefighters' aerial
ladders, authorities said.
   After rescuers evacuated the 15-story Midtown Towers in
below-zero cold, 77 residents and two firefighters were taken to
Watertown's two hospitals, most for treatment of smoke inhalation.
Six residents were listed in critical condition.
   ``A lot of people were hanging out the upstairs windows
screaming,'' said Bruce Wright of Guilfoyle Ambulance Service Inc.
``There was a tremendous amount of flames coming out the front and
back end of the building.''
   Fire Chief Joseph H. Gravelle said a door at the base of the
building's stairwell jammed, trapping some residents until it was
pried open. Most of the dead and injured were reportedly found in
stairwells, he said.
   State fire investigators classified the fire as ``probable
arson,'' Police Chief Michael J. Hennegan said. He said if this
preliminary determination stands, the deaths will be investigated
as homicides.
   Investigators said the fire started shortly after midnight in a
first-floor recreation area of the 20-year-old building, which has
150 apartments.
   More than 100 firefighters from nine departments arrived within
minutes and controlled the blaze within an hour.
   Gravelle said the fire was contained to the first floor, but
that smoke quickly spread throughout the building. He said a safety
violations helped the fire spread on the first floor _ the
recreation room's double doors were left open overnight.
   One of the dead was found in a hallway and two were found in
stairwells on the 12th and 13th floors, beyond the reach of the
city's aerial ladders.
   ``There's not a truck in the world that could reach the top of
the building,'' said former Watertown Fire Chief Ronald D. Damon,
adding that the fire truck ladders reach about eight stories.
   Firefighters led about 200 elderly residents down
fire-protective staircases out of the building or through apartment
windows to a suspended aerial platform.
   A shelter was set up nearby for those residents not requiring
medical treatment.
   ``I was asleep with my TV on, and all of a sudden the smoke
alarm went on and I got right up,'' said 78-year-old Edna Gardner.
   Police Sgt. Ray Montrois identified the dead as Pansy Kiernan
88, Eunice Roberts, 88 and Frank Pepe, 69, all residents.

<HEAD>Factory Output Little Changed As Sluggishness Spreads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial production was little changed in
November despite rebounding from a major strike and a devestating
earthquake, the government said Friday in a report that showed
spreading economic sluggishness.
   Many economists said the weak 0.1 percent gain in output _ the
first in three months _ accompanied by moderating inflation
suggests the Federal Reserve Board should permit another drop in
short-term interest rates to stimulate the economy.
   ``Manufacturing production continues to slow _ it's not
collapsing, but it is slowing _ and I think the Fed is sensing that
it has some type of leeway to ease'' rates, said John Silvia, an
economist with Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
   In its report Friday on industrial production, the Fed
attributed the gain to a rebound from the Boeing Co. strike, which
ended in late November, and from the lingering effects in the
computer and related industries from the San Francisco Bay-area
earthquake in October, when output had slumped 0.6 percent.
   ``Excluding the impact of these events, the total index would
have been little changed in both October and November.'' the Fed
reported.
   The manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the
Fed's tight-money policies as the central bank tries to contain
inflation by slowing the economy without tipping it into a
recession.
   But in the latest report on inflation, the Commerce Department
said Friday that wholesale prices dipped 0.1 percent in November,
the third decline in five months.
   Industrial output had not risen since a 0.4 percent gain last
August and that followed a 0.1 percent drop in July. It was down
0.3 percent in September.
   ``Clearly, the manufacturing sector is sluggish,'' contended
Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in
Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``It started in the auto industry earlier this year and spread
to other consumer durables,'' he said. ``We're seeing softness in
appliances and furniture and, in the last month or so, seeing it
show up in the capital goods industry.''
   Output at manufacturing plants making both durable and
nondurable goods rose 0.2 percent in November after falling 0.8
percent in October and 0.4 percent in September.
   Production of durable goods _ items expected to last more than
three years _ rose 0.5 percent last month after falling 1.8 percent
in October and 0.7 percent in September. Nondurable manufacturing
fell 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in October and 0.1
percent in September.
   In another report reflecting sluggishness, the Fed said the
operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged
down 0.1 percentage point to 82.7 percent in November to its lowest
rate since April 1988.
   ``That's one of the reasons you're seeing producer prices
falling,'' said Donald Ratajczak, economic forecasting director at
Georgia State University. ``When you have excess capacity, that's
when you see price concessions.''
   The closer U.S. industry gets to full operating capacity, the
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand, leading
to shortages and subsequent price increases.
   Analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or
above as an indication of inflationary pressures.
   Factory use had dipped in October to 82.8 percent from 83.4
percent in September. The rate posted 10-year highs of 84.3 percent
last December and January.

popular stocking stuffers, with ``Off-Road,'' ``Super Mario Bros.
II'' and ``Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles'' the absolute
gotta-haves, according to video distributor Clardy Malugen,
president of Tri-Coast International.
   Youngsters accustomed to getting everything on a platinum
platter can join their socially correct little pals in winter fun
with a minimum of strain. The Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue offers
a $20 hands-free snowball maker that ``helps eliminate wet gloves
and cold hands for safer, more comfortable winter fun.'' There's
also an $80 folding toboggan.
   An airborne holiday captures the imagination of some. Heli-LA
promises an evening to remember for $189, which includes a stretch
limousine, candlelight dinner and a helicopter flight along the
coast and Beverly Hills.
   Celebrities such as Dan Aykroyd, James Coburn and Heather
Locklear are among those who have enjoyed a $500-per-couple evening
presented by Amy Tunick and Matthew Sarver.
   A Swedish massage kicks off the four-hour evening, which
includes a gourmet feast. ``It's right in step with the trend
toward cocooning,'' said Tunick, referring to upscale couch
potatoes.
   There are $1,500 embroidered shawls at Federico in Santa Monica,
and Pasadena's Belladonna boutique offers $298 bronze sequin
jackets that promise to ``dazzle her into the 1990s.''
   The holiday buying binge doesn't overlook the age of glasnost. A
Soviet watch for $100 is offered in Spiegel's catalog, which is
titled ``Candice Bergen's 42 Last Minute Holiday Gift Ideas.'' The
mail-order booklet also features a $2,950 Lindbergh Longines watch.
   A $5,200 reversible mink and black leather blouson jacket was
the rage at the Beverly Hills Mr. Guy store on snooty Rodeo Drive.
And the glasnost theme returns with a $1,050, angora and wool blend
Russian-style overcoat.
   For those who want a gift that keeps on giving, Los
Angeles-based Revenge a la Carte may offer a solution. For about
$30, Allen Pool will put a victim's name on the mailing lists of 20
religious organizations. For the same price, he'll deliver a voodoo
doll, dead flowers or a rotting sea bass.
   And for $150, he'll send a pregnant woman to crash a wedding
reception and tell the groom: ``Don't pretend you don't know me!''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev led the nation Friday in
mourning Andrei D. Sakharov in a dramatic show of respect for the
physicist and human rights champion the Kremlin once subjected to
internal exile, force-feeding and KGB harassment.
   Sakharov, who won the the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, died
Thursday at age 68 in his Moscow home, apparently of a heart
attack, as he prepared for the latest battle in his war for
democracy and human rights.
   A brilliant scientist, Sakharov helped develop the hydrogen
bomb. But he sacrificed the perks and honors due a top scientist to
pursue a human rights campaign that spanned three decades and made
him the conscience of the nation.
   He lived to see many of his dreams come true and his own people
acknowledge his greatness, as the rest of the world had done much
earlier.
   But he died without fulfilling his latest cause: forcing the
Communist Party to give up its monopoly on power.
   Gorbachev, who in 1986 freed Sakharov from nearly seven years in
exile in the remote city of Gorky, frequently argued with him in
public but was respectful in the end.
   ``He was not some sort of political intriguer,'' the Kremlin
chief told reporters during a break in a session of the Congress of
People's Deputies. ``He was a person who had his own ideas, his own
convictions which he expressed openly and directly. I valued this
in him. This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on many
things we did agree.''
   President Bush sent a message to Sakharov's widow, fellow human
rights activist Yelena Bonner, saying, ``All of us are diminished
by his utimely death.''
   ``All of us who knew him will never forget his courage and
devotion to freedom,'' Bush said. ``In the darkest hours of his
struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, he embodied all that
is good and decent in the human spirit.''
   Sakharov died alone in his study after returning home from a
meeting of opposition deputies, where he charged the Soviet
hierarchy was leading the country to catastrophe. His body was
discovered by his wife.
   Yefrem Yankelevich, Sakharov's son-in-law, said Sakharov's last
words to his family were: ``Tomorrow there will be a battle'' _ a
reference to his plans to press again for an end to the Communist
Party's monopoly on power.
   He then went to prepare for Friday's session of the Congress,
the parliament to which he was elected this year.
   The congress formed a committee to organize the funeral. A
secretary at the Lebedev Physics Institute where Sakharov worked
said he would be buried Monday alongside his parents at
Vostryakovskoe Cemetery in southwest Moscow. Gorbachev said he
would attend.
   Bonner, Sakharov's source of strength and his companion during
the years of struggle and exile, sat in a chair next to the body
Friday. A few close friends were admitted to the study, a separate
apartment one floor down from his seventh floor apartment on
Moscow's Garden Ring Road.
   Sakharov, who suffered angina, had looked tired in recent
months, which were filled with foreign trips and work as a deputy.
   Age and poor health curtailed his activities _ he looked far
older than his years _ but when he felt he had to speak out, he did.
   Though he was a poor speaker, with a slight stutter and
high-pitched voice, the public had come to know and like Sakharov
so much that an unscientific newspaper poll in October indicated he
was the most popular parliamentarian _ outscoring even Gorbachev
and the maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin.
   An official statement showed how far the country had come from
the days when Sakharov was vilified.
   ``Everything that he did was dictated by his tireless
conscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov, a member of the Presidium of the Congress and the
Communist Party Politburo, said in announcing Sakharov's death to
the deputies.
   Fellow scholar-deputy Dmitri Likhachev told the deputies: ``With
Sakharov, a part of our heart has departed from us.''
   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in
Soviet labor camps before emigrating to Israel in 1986, said
Sakharov ``helped change the whole climate in the Soviet Union.''
   Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said
Sakharov's death was ``a great loss for reform both in the Soviet
Union and everywhere else.''
   ``We needed this man for reforms and for the troubles connected
with them,'' he told the Polish PAP news agency.
   Gorbachev's reform program brought progress toward the goals
Sakharov had set since he turned from nuclear physics to human
rights: withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, glasnost _ or
openness _ on the country's problems, the right to strike, economic
autonomy for factories, amnesty for political prisoners and freedom
of emigration.
   But Sakharov pressed harder.

   Getting the highly rated news show as a Sunday night lead-in for

Lansbury told Parade magazine for Sunday's edition.
   While she's grateful now, Lansbury said she didn't realize the
importance of her time slot when ``Murder, She Wrote'' debuted.
   ``I was such a newcomer to television, I didn't understand its
importance. CBS originally thought of putting me on Saturday night,
then suddenly said, `No, it's Sunday,''' she recalled.

   Actress Darryl Hannah has looks, luck and
success _ but she remembers things being quite different when she
was growing up.
   ``I had no figure until I was 18,'' Hannah told Vanity Fair for
its January issue.
   As far as meeting men, she says, ``I didn't know how to make
friends. ... I met people in grocery stores. Usually I'd go out
with a girlfriend so we could dance with each other; we didn't want
to dance with people we didn't know.''
   Hannah, who starred in ``Roxanne,'' ``Wall Street'' and ``Steel
Magnolias,'' said she decides which roles to accept based on the
script.
   ``My basic concern is the writing. Now I'll choose movies by my
affinity for the characters,'' she said. ``As long as I have an
empathy for the character and can do a good job, I don't care if
the character is `good' or `antagonistic.'''

   Mayor Art Agnos got rave reviews for his
performance after the Oct. 17 earthquake, but it will be months
before critics can review his big screen debut.
   Agnos played himself Thursday in a scene that required that he
arrive outside Mission Dolores to join a crowd mourning the death
of a character in the film ``Class Action.''
   Agnos certainly sounded like an actor when he said, ``I'm a
little dissatisfied. My part's not big enough. I'm not talking,
just walking.''
   The movie features Gene Hackman as a long-time civil rights
attorney and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his daughter, a lawyer
with a conservative corporate law firm.
   Agnos hailed the project as an example of the city's
``rejuvenated post-quake economy.'' An aide said the three months
of filming should bring at least $3 million into the city.
   The mayor's scene required eight takes. After the first take,
director Michael Apted scolded local reporters and photographers,
who were also playing themselves: ``I've never seen you so polite.''

   ``I personally respect Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev very much,
but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of
perestroika,'' Sakharov told the Congress in June after it added
the presidency to Gorbachev's job as party general secretary.
   He said he had no regrets about the difficult path he had
followed.
   ``I am proud of this exile in Gorky like a medal I wear,'' he
told the Congress.
   Sakharov was born May 21, 1921, in Moscow, and like his father
became a physicist. He was inducted into the Academy of Sciences in
1953 at age 32, the youngest member ever.
   In 1948, he joined physicist Igor Tamm in developing the
hydrogen bomb and for the next 20 years lived in secrecy with a
good apartment, driver, high salary and government awards. But,
like Albert Einstein, Sakharov began to worry about the morality of
developing weapons of mass destruction.
   He had his first major brush with the Kremlin in 1961, when he
appealed to Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev to stop testing nuclear
weapons. Khrushchev responded that scientists shouldn't meddle in
politics. Two years later, the Soviet Union agreed to such limits
in a treaty with the United States.
   Sakharov, horrified at Soviet society's mistreatment of its
citizens, said his ``social and political views underwent a major
evolution.'' He risked his status and began using his influence for
victims of human rights abuses in 1966.
   The authorities showed their rage in 1968, when Sakharov's
``Progress, Co-existence and Intellectual Freedom'' was published
abroad. It called for Soviet-American detente long before the
concept became part of Soviet foreign policy. He was banned from
work on secret projects.
   Sakharov called the essay ``a turning point in my life'' and two
years later he helped found the Moscow Human Rights Committee.
After the 1968 death of his first wife, Klavdia, he married Bonner
in 1971, and she became his constant companion.
   He spoke out against repression of dissidents and for democratic
reforms. His cluttered one-bedroom apartment became a mecca for
troubled Soviets: Crimean Tatars, Volga Germans, political
prisoners, religious believers and refuseniks _ Jews denied
permission to emigrate.
   In awarding him the peace prize in 1975, the Nobel Committee
called him ``the conscience of contemporary mankind.''
   By 1980, the authorities had had enough. Sakharov condemned the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in an American TV interview and on
Jan. 22, 1980, KGB agents seized him on a Moscow street. Without
charges or a trial, he was exiled to Gorky, 250 miles east of the
capital, and stripped of his awards.
   The once-respected scientist spent nearly seven years in the
remote city with KGB guards trailing him, searching his apartment
and secretly filming him. He was cut off from the world.
   Despite heart trouble, Sakharov was drugged and tied to a bed
and force-fed during a hunger strike.
   ``We won't let you die, but we will make you an invalid,'' a
doctor warned him.
   Western governments, scientific and human rights groups pressed
the Soviets to release Sakharov. Then in December 1986, Gorbachev
phoned to say he could return to Moscow. Sakharov, restraining his
joy at the news to show his concern for others, told Gorbachev to
free all political prisoners.
   Two months after Sakharov's release, scores of political
prisoners were freed and he threw his support behind Gorbachev. He
got his old job back at the Academy of Sciences and in November
1988 was allowed to travel abroad for the first time, even though
Gorbachev had said Sakharov could not go to other countries because
he knew state secrets.
   Survivors include a son and two daughters from his first
marriage, as well as Bonner's children from a previous marriage:
son, Alexei Semyonov, and daughter, Tatiana, who is married to
Yefrem Yankelevich.

<HEAD>East Germans Pour Into West for Christmas Shopping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans hopped
onto crowded westward trains or trudged across the border through
pouring rain Friday in a rush to do their Christmas shopping in the
West.
   The Communist leadership reminded its citizens that despite
their forays into ``consumer paradise,'' some ``hard, sweaty work''
is needed to improve things back home.
   Since borders were opened Nov. 9, millions of East Germans have
poured into the West Germany, lured in part by the 100 marks ($55)
in ``welcome money'' the Bonn government gives each of them.
   With Christmas just around the corner, the pace of visitors has
picked up, with 320,000 crossing into northern Bavaria alone early
Friday. Tens of thousands more arrived in West Berlin and other
parts of West Germany.
   Officials in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein and the
central state of Hesse were planning to open nine new border
crossings to handle the influx.
   To cut down on the traffic chaos, the new crossings will be
limited to those on bicycle and foot.
   The will to shop was driving some of the visitors to extremes.
   Dozens waited at the crossing near near Probstzella, jumping
onto packed trains as they slowed down before entering northern
Bavaria, said Hans Schlee of the state border police headquarters
in Munich.
   About 1,100 people couldn't get on any train at Probstzella and
walked into Bavaria through a driving, nearly freezing rain.
Shivering and soaked, the group arrived in nearby Ludwigstadt, much
to the surprise of local townspeople.
   ``It's unbelievable what people will do,'' said Schlee, noting
there were dozens of children in the group.
   The now-familiar East German Trabant cars filled parking places
in downtown Munich and in other major West German towns along the
border.
   But the Communist Party newspaper Neues Deutschland reminded its
readers the shoppers will be returning to the same troubles after
their excursions to what it called ``consumer paradise.''
   ``The shining mountains of goods in the society of
over-abundance have magical attraction,'' the newspaper
acknowledged.
   But it cautioned: ``We will have to live with the reality of
open borders but a markedly lower level of productivity and
prosperity.''
   It will take ``hard, sweaty work'' to minimize the gap between
East Germany and its rich Western neighbor, it said.
   For those thinking of possible reunification, Neues Deutschland
warned of the ``two million unemployed in the Federal Republic, an
estimated six million poor as well as the crisis in housing and
education.''
   East German leaders have been pleading with the people to avoid
the temptation of reunification with West Germany.
   But there are growing indications that a sizeable portion of the
country would gladly exchange socialism for some of the shimmer and
prosperity of Western capitalism.
   Despite the new freedom of movement, more than 1,000 East
Germans each day are coming to West Germany to resettle permanently.

   OK, so they were about 56 dogs short.
   But the 45 people dressed in spotted suits masquerading as ``101
Dalmatians'' were a hit with the crowd Thursday and as they ran
along they barked a Christmas carol.
   Every year, hundreds of runners dress up and jog through the
streets in the Jingle Bell Run, a zany event that mixes racing and
costume competition. This year's event raised money for a local
blood center.
   One group of runners dressed as a Nintendo game set, complete
with a silver screen and two fighters trying to save Christmas.
There was a group of rap-singing and dancing reindeer.
   There also was a group of ``Christmas seals,'' all wearing brown
trash bags and whiskers. And there was a Santa-and-elf duet, with
the elf inhaling helium before the two sang ``Jingle Bells.''

   He retired Friday after 21 years as a water meter reader in this

   And what's one of the first things he plans to do in his golden
years?
   Why, go to Disneyland, of course.
   Duck, who turns 65 next month, was born nine years before Walt
Disney introduced his ``wise-quacking'' cartoon character.
   ``I'm the original Donald Duck,'' Duck says matter-of-factly,
recalling a few occasions when his name almost landed him in
trouble, like the time he had to give his name to a traffic cop who
replied: ``Yeah, and I'm Mickey Mouse.''
   Duck's sister wrote Disney to inform him that her brother was
the original Donald Duck, but of a different feather.
   Disney replied with a cartoon sketch autographed: ``To Donald
Duck, from Donald Duck and Walt Disney.''

   His last words were about continuing the fight.
   Over a quarter-century Andrei D. Sakharov, 68, pursued his
vision of a just, less-brutal society, undaunted by Kremlin
vilification, the scorn of his scientific peers and the KGB.
   Before anybody but Sovietologists had heard of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Sakharov demanded ``glasnost'' _ Gorbachev's policy of
openness. Before Gorbachev's Kremlin declared a 19-month unilateral
freeze on nuclear testing, Sakharov publicly sought a halt to all
tests.
   Long before the Soviet leadership admitted Stalin's crimes to
the world, Sakharov was among those few who denounced them, and he
noisily sought redress for the victims.
   The Kremlin this year acknowledged its 1979 invasion of
Afghanistan was a mistake and even a crime, but Sakharov in 1980
had denounced it, and he paid with nearly seven years of exile.
   The stooped, rumpled physicist died Thursday, but the future he
and other dissidents fought so hard for in the 1960s and '70s has
in part come true. For many Soviets, the man who spoke his
independent mind in a stammering voice will be irreplacable.
   ``We have lost our moral compass,'' mourned Roald Z. Sagdeyev,
Sakharov's colleague at the Academy of Sciences and a fellow member
of the Congress of People's Deputies.
   At the height of the dissident era in the 1970s, no cause seemed
too small for Sakharov: Crimean Tatars, Soviet Jews and Germans
seeking to emigrate, dissidents and religious activists all found
succor and sympathy in his two-room Moscow apartment.
   While others kept silent in the oppression of the pre-Gorbachev
era, this honored son of the Soviet regime spoke out against
injustice and in favor of individual freedom. He risked his
personal fortune, his liberty, his health.
   The worldwide opprobrium his criticisms brought the Kremlin,
plus outrage at his 1980 exile to Gorky and brutal treatment there
by the KGB, showed Soviet leaders they could not hope to be fully
accepted members of the international community while still
repressing their citizenry.
   Sakharov's voice was only one of many raised in protest, but it
carried the farthest.
   In December 1986, when Gorbachev telephoned him in Gorky to say
he could return to Moscow, it proved the Kremlin, proclaiming
greater openness, was now ready to tolerate criticism it once
branded anti-Soviet and even treasonous.
   Many of the causes pursued by Sakharov and the dissidents of the
1970s were won under Gorbachev, named Soviet leader in March 1985.
There are now greater liberties of self-expression, freer
emigration, successes in superpower disarmament, mass amnesties of
political prisoners.
   Soviet dissent, however, continues on other themes, from
pro-independence political groups in the Baltics to the Democratic
Union, a self-styled alternative party seeking a British-style
parliament. But none of their members has the domestic audience and
international reach of Sakharov, and other anti-establishment
leaders, like maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, are considered
by many to be demagogues or driven by ambition.
   A developer of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who later recoiled in
horror at what he had wrought, Sakharov could have settled into a
comfortable life back in Moscow with his wife, Yelena Bonner,
continuing research on the physical properties of the universe. He
did so for a while. But his conscience would not let him rest.
   ``I personally respect Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev very much,
but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of
perestroika,'' he declared this summer, after overcoming opposition
from the leadership of the Academy of Sciences to become one of its
representatives in the new Congress.
   With growing determination, Sakharov fought against the
Communist Party's constitutional monopoly on power. His status as a
deputy meant that for the first time, tens of millions of Soviets
heard his views on state-run TV. He had spoken out previously about
the abuses of power; now he wanted to alter the very foundations of
power.
   It was to be his last, as yet unsuccessful fight. A nationwide
strike Sakharov called for Monday to force the Congress to enact a
multiparty system flopped. Led by Gorbachev, the parliamentarians
rejected debate on the issue 1,138 to 839.
   After dinner Thursday, the Nobel Peace laureate left his
seventh-floor Moscow apartment for his book-strewn office one floor
below. He was planning a speech to renew his attack on Article 6,
the constitutional guarantee of Communist Party rule.
   His parting words were, ``Tomorrow there will be a battle,''
said son-in-law Yefrem Yankelevich. It was one of the rare battles
of his times that Sakharov would not take part in. He died alone,
apparently of a heart attack.
   Retiring on his laurels were not for Sakharov. In June, he
tangled for the first time with Gorbachev at the Soviet Congress
over breaking the Communist Party's legal grip on power.
   Gorbachev tried to cut him off, but Sakharov kept speaking. ``I
will continue,'' Sakharov declared from the podium. He did until
the end.

   Zimbabwe's main opposition party Friday

   Edgar Tekere, leader of the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, also said
the nation should seek a dialogue with neighboring South Africa.
   Tekere, 52, was a founder of President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe
African National Union and a secretary-general. But Mugabe fired
him a year ago after Tekere publicly attacked the goverment for
alleged widespread corruption.
   Tekere formed the Unity Movement in April, and gained support
from students, trade union members and farmers disillusioned with
unfulfilled promises of reform made when Mugabe led the British
colony to independence in 1980.
   The Unity Movement has lost five parliamentary by-elections in
government strongholds. But it captured sufficient ballots to raise
government fears that Tekere could secure a foothold in the
150-seat parliament in elections next year.
   A date has not been set for the balloting but it must be held
before April 18, the nation's 10th anniversary.
   Zimbabwe is one of the few Western-style democracies in Africa.
But the aim of Mugabe's African National Union has been to
establish a one-party state founded on Marxist-Leninist principles.
   The party is to hold a five-day congress beginning Tuesday and
the 4,800 delegates are to debate whether they should stick with
their goal of creating a one-party state at a time when most
Eastern European countries that were Mugabe's role models are
adopting democratic reforms.
   The African National Union would need the support of two-thirds
of parliament to change to a one-party system.
   Tekere said such a system would amount to tyranny.
   His platform calls for replacing the presidency with the
ceremonial post of head of state and a prime minister as the
government leader.
   ``The executive presidency in Zimbabwe concentrates power in one
individual and this dangerous consolidation of power in a single
set of hands must be avoided,'' Tekere said at a news conference
Friday.
   He also said Zimbabwe should establish contacts with the ruling
white minority in South Africa. Tekere said that nation's
government deserved recognition for holding talks with black
nationalists, capped this week by South African President F.W. de
Klerk's meeting with Nelson Mandela, leader of the outlawed African
National Congress.
   ``Why not take a lead from Mandela?'' Tekere said.
   Mugabe's government opposes contacts with South Africa.
   The Unity Movement's platform also calls for an economic policy
based on a combination of socialism and free enterprise, and a
redistribution of land to benefit the nation's 9 million blacks.
About a third of the land now is held by the white minority, which
numbers about 100,000.
   A similar program failed under Mugabe's government when
politicians bought up most available farms.
   Tekere also said Zimbabwe should withdraw its 12,000 troops from
neighboring Mozambique, where they are guarding trade routes
against attacks by guerrillas of the right-wing Mozambique National
Resistance. Tekere said Zimbabwe should open talks with the rebels
to stop the attacks.

   A flock of hefty Muscovy ducks has
terrorized residents of this quiet retirement community, nipping at
their heals, chasing them to their doors and chewing on one woman's
dress.
   ``They are mean,'' Natalie Scaccia said Friday. ``They keep
after you. They get ugly and want to bite people.'' Her husband
fell over a wire fence and cut his finger trying to get away from
one.
   In the past month the ducks, which number about 100, have bitten
or harassed six residents, said Ida Trzaskowski, 82, president of
the Palm Terrace Civic Association.
   Lena Piemonte said she is scared to leave home. When she went
outside to check her mail Tuesday, she was attacked. The duck
crossed a street and chased her to her doorstep.
   ``He chewed on my dress,'' she said. ``I was trying to get away
and I took a terrible fall.''
   She took her late husband's cane Friday when she went to the
mailbox. ``If anyone comes near me, I'm going to bat them. They're
not going to attack me again.''
   The Pasco County sheriff's office said one person got a tetanus
shot after she was bitten on the finger by one of the ducks.
   ``They're attacking our people,'' Trzaskowski said. ``They're
scared to death; they never expected an animal like that to come
after them.''
   The animals have no fear of people because people feed them. And
drainage ponds in the subdivision attract them.
   County animal control workers and state wildlife officials tell
residents they cannot help.
   Pasco County animal control officers don't remove ducks because
they'll just fly back to the same spot, said manager E. Gordon
Ulrey. ``We don't do ducks,'' he said.
   Because the animals are not native to Florida, the state Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission does not have jurisdiction to
remove them, said Steve Martin, a commission wildlife specialist.
   The ducks were brought to Florida about 50 years ago from South
America and reproduce rapidly, animal experts said. The muscovy
weigh as much as 25 pounds, have thick necks, clawed feet and red
patches on their faces.

   A cat fancier sued Orkin Exterminating Co.,
accusing the pest control company of poisoning and burying her cat
when she had her house fumigated.
   ``The point of the whole suit is that they need to recognize the
value of animals and what animals mean to a lot of people,'' said
Lisa Hogan, a nurse who filed suit Thursday in Hillsborough Circuit
Court.
   The lawsuit did not specify the amount of damages sought.
   An Orkin crew had put a tarpaulin over Ms. Hogan's house to
prepare for termite fumigation June 29, according to the lawsuit.
While Ms. Hogan and a roommate were moving pets out, Dewey, a big
gray cat, jumped from her roommate's arms and scrambled beneath the
house.
   She said she tried to lure Dewey out with cat food but failed.
   Ms. Hogan told an Orkin employee not to begin fumigating ``if
there was any chance of her cat being under the house,'' according
to the lawsuit.
   The cat's body was found nearly a week later, half-covered with
soil a few feet from the back porch, she said.
   Ms. Hogan said an Orkin employee she talked with, identified
only as Mike in the complaint, acknowledged burying the cat.
   Chip Girkins, general manager for Orkin in Tampa, said Ms. Hogan
told workers to fumigate the house even though she knew the cat
might be underneath it. He acknowledged a worker buried the cat
without telling the owner.
   ``They were trying to make it easier on her,'' Girkins said.

   The government, criticized a year ago for
holding back public warning of possible terrorist activity, issued
a rare advisory Friday saying there could be holiday-season attacks
on Americans overseas.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued a similar bulletin to
airlines, and a spokesman for Pan American World Airways said, ``We
have enhanced our security system-wide.''
   ``We want to be as forthcoming as possible with information of
this kind,'' said State Department press officer Anita Stockman.
``The information we have received constitutes sufficient reason to
be concerned and to pass our concern to the American people.''
   She said there was ``no information about a specific threat
against Americans'' but that the warning was based on ``an
increased level of weapons seizures and arrests of persons
affiliated with Middle Eastern terrorist groups'' in recent weeks.
   She emphasized that for traveling Americans, ``We are not
advising anybody anything. We are not asking or advising people to
cancel travel plans. ... We are simply passing on information we
feel should be brought to the attention of travelers, who must make
their own decisions.''
   The government advisory came just six days before the first
anniversary of the terrorist attack that blew up Pan Am Flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 aboard as well as 11
people on the ground.
   In the ensuing investigation, it was revealed that U.S.
authorities had received warnings about the possibility of a
terrorist attack but had not made them public, believing they were
not necessarily reliable and might unduly spread alarm.
   This time, the U.S. government decided to issue a public
advisory at the same time it began briefing foreign governments
about such a threat, said a department official who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
   A brief statement issued by the department cited ``recent
reports of movement of Middle Eastern terrorists in Western
Europe'' and suggested ``terrorists may be planning near-term
attacks against a variety of targets, possibly including U.S.
interests.''
   It did not say more specifically where attacks might occur, but
added: ``If credible, specific information or a threat to the
public is received, the Department of State will provide additional
information for travelers and other concerned parties.''
   In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration advised
airlines to step up security on potentially affected flights.
   ``Certainly it enhances our vigilance,'' said Jeff Kriendler, a
spokesman for Pan American World Airways. But he said he did not
believe the alert would impede holiday travel. ``We do have a
system in place which we think we can handle the flow,'' he said.
   In New York, Pan Am spokesman Alan Loflin said, ``Largely
because of the anniversary we have coming up, and also because of
the incredible amount of passenger traffic, we have enhanced out
security system-wide. Mostly, this involves using more (security)
people.''
   He declined to give specifics on additional security.
   Friday's announcement ``is significant because it's the first
time I'm aware of that there is a public announcement,'' said
Robert Kupperman, a terrorism expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
   In the case of Pan Am 103, ``we warned some government officials
and left the public naked. This time it appears we're not going to
get caught in that way.''
   The warnings followed a high-visibility mobilization of security
forces in France, where officers were posted at airports, public
buildings and other areas where large numbers of people congregate.
One U.S. government source said France was the prime focus of
American concerns.
   The warning was triggered in part by the discovery of 440 pounds
of explosives Nov. 24 in Valencia, Spain, and the arrest by Spanish
police of eight men.
   French police said the men and explosives had been destined for
France. Spanish authorities said at least three of those arrested
are members of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group of extremist Shiites
based in Lebanon.
   Also raising concern was the arrival of the Christmas season,
with a number of anniversaries coming up which terrorists sometimes
use as occasions for carrying out violent activities.
   Besides the Pan Am explosion, other terrorist incidents that
have occurred in December include attacks on the airports in Rome
and Vienna two days after Christmas in 1985. The department
official said the increased number of Americans in Europe during
the holiday season is additional cause for wariness.

<TEXT>
   An Army board has refused to grant the Medal
of Honor to a World War II veteran who colleagues claimed was
passed over for decoration because he was Jewish, an Army official,
Lt. Col. Terry Adkins, said today.
   David S. Rubitsky, then an Army sergeant, had been recommended
for the medal by company and battalion commanders. They cited a
battle in the jungles of New Guinea in which he was said to have
killed more than 500 Japanese soldiers.
   Adkins said an ``exhaustive'' two-year investigation into
Rubitsky's claims showed the battle ``did not occur as alleged.''
   As for the claim that Rubitsky was denied the medal because of
anti-Semitism, he said, ``I could not find any basis of fact in
this.''
   Rubitsky, who lives in Wisconsin, was notified Thursday night of
the decision and the army presented its findings to Congress today,
Adkins said.
   The Army's decision was first reported today by The New York
Times.
   Board officials said the lack of official records, the death of
witnesses and the failing memories of those who survived the
campaign thwarted their review.
   But the toughest obstacle was the implausibility that one
soldier _ armed with a machine gun, automatic rifle and a carbine _
could inflict such damage singlehandedly.
   They said Rubitsky would have needed large amounts of ammunition
and would have been able to fire only one weapon while the Japanese
returned his fire, forcing him to keep his head down and shoot
without taking aim.
   Board officials said it was most likely Rubitsky fought well and
had inflicted heavy casualties.
   The story of Rubitsky's heroics had been largely forgotten until
1986, when during a reunion of the 128th Regiment he fought in, it
was learned he had never been recommended for the Medal of Honor.
After the war, Rubitsky traveled the world as a merchant marine for
more than 30 years.
   J.M. Stehling, his company commander, said in a recently
notarized statement: ``I personally inspected the battle scene and
there were more than 500 Japanese killed or wounded by the actions
of Sgt. Rubitsky. His actions were heroic, and he should receive
the Medal of Honor.''
   In another statement, Herbert A. Smith, a retired major general
who was Rubitsky's battalion commander, said he passed Stehling's
recommendation to Col. John H. Mott, chief of staff of the 32nd
Division.
   ``Col. Mott's answer was, `You mean a Jew for the Congressional
Medal of Honor?''' said Smith, who died three months ago.
   Smith said Mott, who also is dead, ``just laughed and walked
away.''
   The board also looked at a handwritten notation on a yellowing
photograph that had been removed from the body of a Japanese
officer 47 years ago. He said he would commit suicide to atone for
having sent into battle ``600 fine Japanese soldiers (who) died
because of a solitary American soldier.''
   Secret Service experts in counterfeiting told Sen. Herbert H.
Kohl, D-Wis., that the ink and paper of the photograph that
recently came to light were consistent with materials used in 1942.
They concluded there was no reason to believe the photo was
``anything other than genuine.''
   Kohl's office had interceded on behalf of Rubitsky, a Wisconsin
resident.
   Of 295 Medals of Honor awarded in World War II, none went to
black soldiers. Only two went to Jews, according to the Jewish War
Veterans of America.

<HEAD>Planned Bush-Mitterrand Lunch a First for Little French Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GLASS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Francois Mitterrand invited George
Bush to lunch Saturday on this sun-splashed French island in the
Caribbean, and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist
dollars from the publicity.
   ``This is a historic situation for St. Martin,'' said Albert
Fleming, mayor of Marigot, the capital. ``We have never had two
presidents together.''
   Bush and Mitterrand will hold a two-hour meeting and working
lunch at an exclusive sun resort on St. Martin, 140 miles east of
Puerto Rico.
   U.S. and French officials have announced no agenda for the
talks, but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest
developments in Eastern Europe, including the reopening of borders
between East Germany and West Germany. The French president has
cautioned against a push for a reunified Germany, saying it could
upset the European balance of power.
   Mitterrand's invitation to Bush was in return for a visit the
French leader made in May to Bush's home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   On arrival at Princess Juliana International Airport on St.
Maarten, the Dutch half of the island, Bush and Mitterrand are to
be flown separately by helicopter to L'Habitation de Longvilliers,
a 253-room luxury hotel and marina at Marcel Cove on the
northeastern coast of St. Martin.
   A helicopter and scores of French presidential gendarmes and
army troops patrolled the 150-acre resort grounds Friday, checking
incoming cars with a metal detector. U.S. security officers also
were making rounds.
   At the meeting site, workers set up a beachside tent for the
leaders and hooked up communication cables.
   Bush and Mitterrand won't be mixing with residents, Fleming
said, which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and
bunting in the capital. A few tourist shops, however, were selling
Bush-Mitterrand T-shirts.
   ``There's a little painting up, a little taping up, but
basically that's for Christmas,'' Fleming said.
   Similarly, on Dutch St. Maarten, there was little evidence of
the event, although Roger Snow, publisher of The Chronicle
newspaper, said: ``Everybody is talking about it, of course.''
   The island Bush and Mitterrand are visiting is a curious mix of
French, Dutch and Carribbean cultures.
   St. Martin, with its sidewalk cafes, fashionable boutiques and
strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks, has been called
a speck of France in the Caribbean. Technically, it is a
sub-prefecture of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe,
which has a status akin to a U.S. state.
   St. Maarten is part of the autonomous five-island Netherland
Antilles. Dutch is the official language, but few people speak it.
Nearly everybody speaks English instead, although the Papiamento
language is also heard.
   The French side is 21 square miles and the Dutch side 16 square
miles. Population estimates vary widely, but the 1990 Caribbean
Island Handbook says there are at least 8,000 in St. Martin and
14,000 in St. Maarten.
   The French have some topless and all-nude beaches; the Dutch,
casino gambling. With duty-free shopping and 36 sandy white beaches
ringing the island, both sides have been experiencing a tourism
boom in recent years, with a corresponding rise in crime and
concerns about overdevelopment.
   Nevertheless, Fleming said he thought the island was bound to
benefit from having hundreds of foreign newspaper reporters and TV
crews covering the one-day summit.
   ``That exposure throughout the world is very important to
tourism'' the mayor said. ``And we cater to the tourist. We don't
have any other income but the tourist trade.''
   Fleming said 600,000 tourists a year visit the French side of
the island alone, spending $90 million, not counting cruise ship
passengers. Americans account for most of the tourist trade.

<HEAD>U.S. Merchandise Trade Deficit Surges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit surged to
$10.2 billion in October, the worst imbalance in 10 months, as a
record level of imports swamped a small rise in exports, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
   The October deficit was a sharp 19.8 percent higher than the
September imbalance of $8.51 billion, reflecting a higher foreign
oil bill and big increases in imports of food and industrial
supplies.
   Private economists said even discounting the month-to-month
volatility in the trade statistics, the October report served to
emphasize that the trade woes that have plagued America throughout
the 1980s will be a principal headache well into the next decade.
   However, there was better economic news on the inflation front,
where prices at the wholesale level posted their third decline in
five months. The 0.1 percent November decline reflected a big drop
in gasoline costs that offset a rise in food prices.
   The November price reduction was expected to further ease fears
about inflation and give the Federal Reserve more room to cut
interest rates in an effort to keep the economy from dipping into a
recession.
   Some analysts predicted that the central bank could act as soon
as next week to cut interest rates slightly, given widespread signs
of weakness, especially in manufacturing.
   In a third economic report, the government said Friday that
America's factories, mines and utilities operated at 82.7 percent
of capacity in November, a drop of 0.1 percentage point from
October and the lowest operating rate since April 1988.
   Last January, the factory operating rate hit a 10-year high of
84.3 percent as American manufacturers boosted production because
of a boom in export sales caused by a drop in the value of the
dollar, which made U.S. goods more competitive on overseas markets.
   However, export growth has slowed this year and many analysts
are predicting it will slow further in 1990, reflecting the fact
that the dollar was rising in value for much of this year.
   When the slowdown in exports is combined with a growing
dependence on foreign oil, many economists are predicting that the
trade deficit will worsen in 1990 after two years of improvements.
   ``Until there is a fundamental change in our competitiveness
situation, I think we'll see the trade deficit averaging around $9
billion a month,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, senior adviser to the
WEFA Group, an economic consulting company.
   ``It is the same old story: Imports are continuing to rise due
to oil and the increased attractiveness of foreign products, many
of which we don't produce any more.''
   Through the first 10 months of this year, the trade deficit has
been running at an annual rate of $109.4 billion, down modestly
from last year's deficit of $118.53 billion.
   David Wyss, senior economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted that
the deficit for the entire year would be around $108 billion but
would rise next year to around $112 billion.
   ``Trade is going to be a continuing problem that is not going to
go away in a hurry,'' he said.
   While some administration officials have also conceded that the
trade deficit could rise next year, the White House issued an
upbeat assessment of the country's international performance,
noting that the trade deficit is still running at a lower rate than
in 1988.
   ``We're doing exactly the right thing and no changes are
necessary at this time,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The overall October deficit of $10.2 billion was the largest
since a $10.8 billion deficit in December 1988.
   Imports climbed to an all-time high of $41.21 billion, 5.1
percent above the September level. Part of this increase had been
expected, given the fact that merchants often boost orders at this
time of year to restock shelves before Christmas.
   Among the biggest import increases were an 18 percent jump in
foreign agricultural shipments and a 14 percent rise in imports of
industrial materials.
   America's foreign oil bill shot up 8.5 percent to $4.38 billion
as the price per barrel rose 71 cents to $17.09. The number of
barrels imported daily was essentially unchanged at 8.26 million.
   U.S. exports were also up, by 1.1 percent, rising to $31.01
billion with analysts saying the gain would have been even better
except for a strike at Boeing that cut down on production of
jetliners.
   As usual, the biggest deficit in October was recorded with
Japan, an imbalance of $4.9 billion, almost half of the total for
the month, as imports from that country hit a record level.
   Other large deficits included a $1.28 billion imbalance with
Taiwan, an $843 million deficit with Canada, a $783 million deficit
with China and a deficit of $461 million with the countries of
Western Europe.

   The NATO foreign ministers on Friday
hailed Andrei D. Sakharov as a pioneer who played a key role in
changing Soviet society.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said the ministers
expressed a ``deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of Andrei
Sakharov.''
   He said the allies underscored that Sakharov ``played an
exceptional role personally and who was a symbol for universal
democratic values.''
   Officials said U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
his NATO counterparts discussed Sakharov at the start of the second
and last day of their year-end strategy talks at the alliance
headquarters.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said in view of the
Soviet human rights leader's stature it was only ``natural that we
reflected for a minute'' on Sakharov's death.
   ``Sakharov is a man we must remember with much respect for the
untiring way he strove for freedom,'' Van den Broek said after the
meeting.
   He called his death ``a loss for the Soviet Union and especially
... for the forces of reform there. For many in the Communist
world, this man was a beacon.''
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after the meeting,
``We all feel a very deep sense of loss at the death of Mr.
Sakharov.''
   ``We should remember today, the great courage which it took in
very difficult and dangerous times for him to act and go on acting
as the focus, symbol, the spokesman of freedom in the Soviet
Union,'' he said.
   Hurd said he was glad Sakharov lived long enough ``to see
substantial progress in the direction which he was pointing his
country toward.''
   ``And I think in remembering that today we must also express the
hope that the torch will be handed on and that work which is not
yet completed will be carried forward by people who will rembmer
him,'' Hurd added.
   Baker called Sakharov ``a tremendous force for peace and
freedom.''
   ``He was as well a courageous pioneer who led the way in the
face of great adversity and we are very sad by his passing,'' Baker
said.
   ``I think Sakharov would be pleased if our reflection on his
work extended as well to all of those brave men and women, many of
them whose names we'll never know, who sacrificed their liberty,
indeed their lives, for the freedom of others.''
   Baker said until the very end, Sakharov pursued ``the causes
that meant the very most to him, standing up in parliament for
beliefs that may not be fully accepted today, but which will have
their day.''

   The Navy can't guarantee pilots won't drop
bombs outside designated central Nevada target ranges, the military
said Friday as cleanup of stray bombs on public lands was suspended
for the winter.
   ``Nobody could say that it won't happen again,'' said Olin
Briggs, spokesman for the Fallon Naval Air Station. ``There's
malfunction of equipment that could happen. ... And there's always
human error.''
   Capt. Rex Rackowitz, commanding officer at Fallon where the
nation's fighter pilots train, has said bombs and rockets might
have landed outside fenced ranges for the past 30 years because of
pilot or equipment error. Or, he has said, they could have skipped
along the desert floor after failing to explode upon impact.
   Bombs, duds and shrapnel that landed as much as one mile outside
ranges were being removed or blown up on site in a seven-week
cleanup exercise codenamed ``Operation Ugly Baby.'' The ranges
begin 60 miles east of Reno.
   There are plans to keep some 110,000 acres surrounding the Bravo
16, 17 and 19 ranges closed to the public through the winter in
case undiscovered ordnance remains, Bureau of Land Management
spokesman Bob Stewart said.
   A team of 150 Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel flown to
Fallon to help with the exercise were going home Friday, Briggs
said. There are no definite plans to enlist such a large group
again to help clear away stray bombs, he added.
   ``It would be misleading to indicate we were finished with this
thing,'' Briggs said. ``We'll keep plugging away at it, relying on
the assets at our base. But basically, we only have five EODs at
Fallon permanantly and they have to work on the ranges, too.''
   Briggs said he expects all the red flagged bombs to be destroyed
Friday so the Navy doesn't leave ordnance exposed during the
winter, although people won't have access to the lands normally
used for hiking, hunting, grazing and off-road vehicles.
   The Navy sought indefinite closure of the 110,000 acres of land
surrounding the bombing ranges because of fears buried ordnance
remains undetected and could blow up if disturbed by people or
animals.
   The land will be reopened next summer and can't be permanantly
closed without congressional approval, Stewart said.
   No injuries have been reported from public contact with any
stray bombs, according to Briggs who said the cleanup exercise went
safely. He said one Navy worker hurt his leg when he fell down a
hill, but no other injuries were reported during the sweeps for
bombs
   Briggs didn't have statistics on the total amount of ordnance
discovered during the exercise that cost the Navy several hundred
thousand dollars. The Navy recovered more than 2,000 bombs and duds
from its Bravo 17 range alone.
   The Navy was cited by the state of Nevada for improper disposal
procedures of hazardous waste and for failing to notify the state
of the cleanup effort that began secretly in October.
   The Navy faces fines of up to $10,000 a day per violation if
found guilty.

   The 16 NATO allies eased East-West
tension another notch Friday, approving a U.S. proposal to let
unarmed Warsaw Pact aircraft fly over their territory in search of
suspicious military activity.
   The ``Open Skies'' idea originated with President Dwight D.
Eisenhower more than 30 years ago, at the height of the Cold War,
and was revised by President Bush last spring to include
surveillance of laboratories.
   It will be discussed at a NATO-Warsaw Pact meeting in February
in Ottawa, Canada, that also could produce new proposals for
further troop reductions in Europe.
   At the end of a two-day meeting, NATO foreign ministers also
agreed to consider proposals by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III that the alliance's role be expanded as the threat of military
confrontation with the Soviet Union recedes.
   Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the Western alliance, said
he was confident of eventual agreement on setting up NATO panels to
verify troop reductions in Europe, and possibly a role in mediating
regional conflicts.
   The ministers welcomed an unprecedented visit to alliance
headquarters by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for
a meeting with Woerner on Tuesday.
   ``I don't see it paving the way for Soviet membership in NATO,''
Baker said at a news conference.
   Woerner, the former West German defense minister, said he and
Shevardnadze would discuss ``matters of common interest. This is a
first contact.''
   ``We will have an exchange of views,'' he said, but ``we will
not negotiate.''
   Shevardnadze also is expected ito meet informally with
ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations.
   Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, described the visit
as ``a symbol of what's been happening'' in East-West relations.
   Foreign Secretary Joe Clark of Canada called it a courtesy call,
and said: ``I think they are interested in opening lines, and in
that context I think it will be quite constructive.''
   Baker said he probably would not pay a similar visit to the
Warsaw Pact because the seven-nation Eastern alliance has no exact
counterpart to Woerner. A visit would mean meeting with a Soviet
general, which Baker ruled out.
   Baker and Shevardnadze are to meet in the Soviet Union at the
end of January.
   Their main task will be clearing a path to completion of a
treaty on reducing long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent in time for Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign it at a Washington summit in
June.
   A statement concluding the annual winter meeting of NATO foreign
ministers welcomed political and economic reforms under way in
Eastern Europe and urged that ``the progress achieved must be
consolidated.''
   Baker would not say whether he considered the changes
irreversible, but declared: ``Everything that we do should be
directed to locking in these changes.''
   In their statement, the ministers said: ``Many problems remain.
The rule of law and democratic government through free elections
have yet to be fully institutionalized.''
   It also included a caution about Soviet military might: ``We
cannot ignore the military realities that our alliance continues to
face and which lie at the heart of Europe's security problems.''
   On ``Open Skies,'' the ministers said the concept ``has a very
special value.''
   ``The willingness of a country to be overflown is, in itself, a
highly significant political act in that it demonstrates its
availability to openness,'' the statement said.
   Western alliance ministers said the aerial surveillance could be
used to ensure compliance with an agreement being negotiated in
Vienna to reduce conventional military forces in Europe.
   They proposed that Europe, the Soviet Union, the United States
and Canada be open to surveillance flights.
   Countries would be assigned quotas, based on size, prescribing
the permitted number of observation flights by unarmed, fixed-wing
aircraft.
   Several flights a month would be allowed over larger countries,
and no country could accept fewer than one every three months.
   On German reunification, Baker endorsed statements by the West
German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, renouncing claims
to Polish territory that belonged to Germany before World War II.
   He said the 1975 Helsinki agreement affirmed that Europe's
postwar borders were ``inviolable.''
   The NATO ministers supported eventual reunification of East
Germany and West Germany through peaceful and democratic means.
   Later Friday, Baker and other U.S. officials met with top
officials of the European Commission, the European Community's
executive body. Baker was accompanied by Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter, trade representative Carla Hills, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and William K. Reilly, administrator of
the Environmental Portection Agency.
   At a joint news conference, Jacques Delors, the commission
president, called for more efficient and effective consultation
with the United States on changes in the East.
   ``You said it, fine,'' Baker commented.

<HEAD>Iranians Vote For Nine Parliamentarians, Seen As Test Of Pragmatism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranians braved rain and cold in Tehran
and five other cities Friday to choose nine Parliament members in
elections considered a crucial test for President Hashemi
Rafsanjani's pragmatic policies.
   Hard-liners fear Rafsanjani's efforts to liberalize the economy
and Iranian society will undermine revolutionary fervor and the
ideological purity of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said turnout in five of the
six constituencies, including Tehran, was so great that the 5
o'clock closing time of the polls was extended by two hours.
   But observers in Tehran reported low voter turnout.
   An Asian diplomat based in Tehran said the 5 p.m. closing time
of the polls was extended to attract last-minute voters in an
effort to increase the count.
   The radio did not provide a figure for voter turnout. But the
Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said all
constituents over 15 were eligible to vote.
   Candidates chosen by the electorate will represent Tehran,
Kashan, Karaj, Kerman, Bandar-Turkman-Kordkui and Kuhdasht-Chegini
in Parliament. Some of the constituencies are multi-member.
   Four seats in Tehran were being contested by 38 candidates, many
of them hard-line opponents of Rafsanjani and his so-called
pragmatic policies.
   Rafsanjani's former seat in Tehran, which he won with a record
1.2 million votes in the last general election in April-May 1988,
is one of those vacant.
   He gave up that seat following his victory in the presidential
elections in June.
   Most of the other vacant seats in the 270-member Majlis, or
parliament, were left empty when Rafsanjani appointed legislators
to posts in his new administration.
   Rafsanjani's ambitious policies to revive the economy by
improving ties with the West to attract badly needed investment and
technology are under attack by a hard-line faction led by former
Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   Mohtashemi, who is contesting one of the Tehran seats, was
dumped in August when Rafsanjani formed his new government.
   He is closely linked with Shiite Moslem extremists believed to
hold most of the 18 Western hostages _ including eight Americans _
in Lebanon.
   He was also involved with militants who carried out suicide
bombings against the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Marine base in
Beirut in 1983, killing hundreds of people.
   Friday's elections are Montashemi's first major effort to make a
comeback.
   The Majlis is already dominated by radicals of various stripes
and further gains by hard-liners in the elections will intensify
pressure on Rafsanjani.
   Rafsanjani has been very low-key about the elections.
   He said Friday after casting his vote that ``these are not the
general elections, therefore they lack enthusiasm. But in any case,
they are effective.'' His remarks were broadcast on Tehran TV,
monitored in Cyprus.
   Khomeini, who died June 3, spent much of his time after the 1979
revolution mediating squabbles between hard-liners and pragmatists,
and keeping their power in check. The power struggle has
intensified since Rafsanjani became president and began sidelining
his opponents.
   Apart from Mohtashemi, a number of other ex-ministers dumped by
Rafsanjani are standing in the election.
   This includes former Labor Minister Abulqasem Sarhadizadeh,
former Education Minister Reza Akrani, former Heavy Industries
Minister Behzad Nabavi, former Commerce Minister Habibollah Asgar
Owladi, and former Posts and Telegraph Minister Morteza Nabavi.

   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
said Friday that acts of violence committed by leftist militants in
Nicaragua against opposition groups raise ``grave doubts'' about
the Sandinista government's willingness to hold fair elections.
   Eagleburger spoke to reporters after outlining his concerns
about the Nicaraguan electoral process to Organization of American
States Secretary General Joao Baena Soares. The OAS has election
observers in Nicaragua.
   The administration has criticized the Sandinista government on
an almost daily basis of late for alleged abuses against opposition
supporters.
   Eagleburger said he told Baena Soares that the recent spate of
Sandinista violence ``is part of a systematic pattern that raises
grave doubts about the intentions of the Nicaraguan government.''
   He said the Nicaraguan government is at a crossroads: ``It can
hold free and fair elections and thereby advance the process of
national reconciliation in Nicaragua and peace in Central America.
   ``Or it can endanger the peace process and the sanctity of the
electoral process by intimidation and violence against the
opposition,'' he said.
   On Thursday, members of a bipartisan panel gave President Bush a
firsthand account of bloodletting last weekend that they said was
caused by Sandinista supporters wielding machetes.
   Cecilia Lopez, a spokeswoman for the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Washington, called the violence ``an isolated incident'' and said
the opposition has held more than 50 peaceful rallies since
campaigning began.
   National elections are set for Feb. 25.

   Organizers of a winter festival are
taking a great deal of heat from critics because they moved the
event indoors to escape freezing weather.
   Many in this Fort Worth suburb are doubly miffed. The Winterfest
had been billed as Arlington's first winter festival, but Main
Events International moved it to th Tarrant County Convention
Center _ in Fort Worth.
   The festival, which is to benefit the Arlington Museum of Art,
will feature artists, musicians and entertainers. It opened Friday
and runs through Sunday.
   ``Why would they schedule an outside event if they are afraid of
weather? This is December, and that happens,'' said Lisann Peters,
president of the Arlington Council of Parent-Teacher Associations.
   ``Had I been making the decision, I would vote to have it in the
spring,'' said Arlington council member Dottie Lynn.
   Festival organizers said they were working on a way to make it
``snow'' inside the convention center to give things a winter-like
atmosphere.

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Friday announced
some major provisions of the 1990 program for flue-cured tobacco.
   The federal marketing quota will be 877.7 million pounds, down
from this year's 890.5 million, said Undersecretary Richard T.
Crowder. The 1990 average yield goal will remain at 2,088 pounds
per acre.
   Next year's national acreage allotment will be 420,354 acres,
down from 426,485 in 1989.
   For each farm, the 1990 basic quota and allotment will decrease
about 1.5 percent from 1989.
   Crowder said the effective quota for 1990, which takes into
consideration previous undermarketings and overmarketings, will be
about 939 million pounds, up 35 million pounds from the 1989
effective quota.
   The price support level for 1990 flue-cured tobacco will be
$1.488 per pound, up 2 cents from this year, he said.
   Further details, including next year's ``no-net-cost
assessment'' and the amount of reduction under the Gramm-Rudman
budget reduction law will be announced later.
   Flue-cured tobacco farmers approved acreage-poundage quotas last
January for crops in 1989 through 1991.

   The four clock faces on Big Ben clanked to a halt
for three hours Friday, and London's heart seemed to skip a beat.
   The government agency that services Big Ben and other state
buildings throughout the country said the clock stopped at 11:07
a.m. and was out of action until about 2:15 p.m.
   A spokeswoman for the Property Services Agency, speaking
anonymously, said the cogs that advance the clock's hands were
unable to turn even though the pendulum continued to swing. She
could not explain what caused the malfunction.
   Big Ben is the name of the 13{-ton bell, which chimes out the
hours from behind the clock faces.
   Stoppages are rare for the giant 131-year-old clock tower, which
has survived pollution, foul weather and war. The British
Broadcasting Corp. uses the chimes to introduce its 6 p.m. and
midnight newscasts, taking the sound live by microphone from the
tower. Its other newscasts use the atomic clock at Greenwich.
   In December 1986, it lost a note in the quarter-hour chimes
because of a broken connecting rod.
   The following month, the hammers that strike its famous bongs
that tell listeners the hour froze up in chilly weather.
Windshields were erected to warm up the clock's mechanism and get
it back on tune.
   The 20-story clock tower stands over the Houses of Parliament,
and one legislator took advantage of the latest stoppage to poke
fun at the policies of the governing Conservative and opposition
Labor parties during a House of Commons debate on socialism.
   ``Far be it for me to defend socialism or whatever brand or
variety the Labor Party is talking about,'' said Charles Kennedy of
the centrist Social and Liberal Democrats. ``I just cannot help but
reflect, however, as I walked in that Big Ben had stopped.''
   Although ``time has run out on socialism,'' said Kennedy, the
clock also seemed to have ``stopped on the conservatism of this
government.''

   Ken Park of Los Altos Hills, owner of Ellin International Co. in

to ship missile parts without a State Department license.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel Levin said no one else has been

   According to police, Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Fredy
and 11 of his bodyguards were shot to death near the Colombian port
of Covenas, on the Caribbean about 75 miles south of Cartagena.
   Gen. Carlos Casadiego, subdirector of the national police in

   Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin cartel, remains at

   Rodriguez Gacha and Escobar have been sought by U.S. and
Colombian authorities since President Virgilio Barco ordered a
crackdown on drug traffickers following the August slaying of a

<HEAD>Minneapolis City Council Drops Law Firm With Ties to El Salvador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council voted Friday to fire a law
firm because it lobbies for Salvadoran President Alfredo
Christiani, a day after four partners and one associate lawyer
resigned from the firm for the same reason.
   ``After individual and collective soul-searching, we decided
that this was the best thing to do,'' said Douglas Franzen, one of
the partners who resigned from O'Connor &amp; Hannan on Thursday.
   The council voted 10-2 to drop the law firm effective Jan. 15,
ending a $500,000 a year legal contract.
   After the slaying of six Jesuits last month in El Salvador, a
group of protesters organized under the banner of the O'Connor &amp;
Hannan Campaign persuaded a majority of the council to support a
resolution co-sponsored by Council Members Carol Johnson and Brian
Coyle.
   Johnson, a primary author of the resolution to end the city's
contract with O'Connor &amp; Hannan, called the lawyers' resignation
``a courageous decision.''
   The other partners who quit are William McGrann, whose office in
Washington, D.C., represents the Salvadoran leader, Douglas
Carnival and Andrew Shea and associate lawyer Kathleen Lamb.
   The five, who make up the Minneapolis office's lobbying
division, are among the best-known legislative lobbyists in the
state. O'Connor &amp; Hannan represents many public bodies, including a
Minneapolis city agency.
   O'Connor &amp; Hannan has said it did not do legal work for
Cristiani and provided only public relations and congressional
lobbying, arranging meetings for Salvadoran officials with key
federal lawmakers and journalists.
   A spokesman for the law firm did not immediately return a phone
call Friday.
   McGrann and Franzen said in an interview Thursday the decision
to resign came after some clients had voiced their uneasiness with
the firm's link to Cristiani, and the lawyers' own personal and
professional convictions compelled them to quit.
   ``The clients said, `We keep reading about your law firm every
day and we don't like what we're seeing. We're uncomfortable about
that,''' McGrann said. ``The whole thing led to making it very
difficult for us to do the kind of work we do, generally in the
public sector, without it impacting our clients. Or at least our
clients felt they were being impacted.''
   Franzen said the group plans to establish a law firm ``and
continue serving our clients as best we can.''
   ``We want to state our belief ... that Mr. Cristiani has a right
to counsel and that right extends to lobbying the U.S. Congress.''
   But, the lawyers said, they did not want to be involved in that
effort and were unable to convince the firm to drop Cristiani.

   A three-ton bull took up a stand in front of the
New York Stock Exchange for part of Friday, but the exchange
couldn't bear the bronze statue and had it hauled away.
   The statue arrived by truck and forklift late Thursday under
cover of darkness.
   ``This is my Christmas present for America. For the bullish
country of America,'' sculptor Arturo Di Modica told the New York
Post, after he deposited te ``The Charging Bull'' on Wall Street.
   He said he chose the location because ``for the stock market,
the bull is strength, and the power of the country is the stock
market.''
   The Sicilian-born sculptor said he started work on the statue in
his SoHo studio after the 1987 stock market crash. He wanted to
create ``a monumental work attesting to the vitality, energy and
life of the American people in adversity.''
   Di Modica, who said he spent $300,000 of his own money on the
project, did not seek a permit to show the work. ``They wouldn't
give me one if I asked.''
   But during the day Friday, the statue was hauled away by a
private company, said police spokesman Sgt. Nick Vreeland.
   ``We did arrange for the bull to be taken away,'' said Sharon
Gamsin, a spokeswoman for the stock exchange.
   ``The city told the artist that he had to take it away, but he
told them he donated it to the city, so we assisted the city in
arranging to have it removed,'' Gamsin said.

   Art Buchwald wants $5 million to teach
Paramount Pictures a lesson, his lawyer said Friday. The columnist
claims the studio stole his script idea and turned it into the
movie hit ``Coming to America.''
   Paramount took Buchwald's idea titled ``King For A Day'' and
transformed it into the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy, which grossed
more than $150 million, the lawyer said in opening arguments of the
trial, being conducted without a jury.
   ``We seek substantial punitive damages to teach Paramount and
others like it a lesson not to treat creative people like this ever
again,'' said attorney Pierce O'Donnell.
   Murphy, the attorney said, already has netted $22 million from
the film and Paramount collected more than $50 million in
distribution fees. But, he said, the studio refused to pay Buchwald
and producer Alain Bernheim $250,000 plus a small share of profits
under their original contract.
   ``Sadly, the evidence shows that even a towering literary figure
like Art Buchwald is prey to an unscrupulous major movie studio,''
the attorney said to Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider.
   An attorney for Paramount, Robert Draper, ridiculed the idea
that Buchwald's script idea was plaigarized.
   He said it was different and that it never occurred to Ned
Tanen, the head of the studio, that there was any similarity
between the two ideas, both of which dealt with an African prince
coming to the United States.
   Draper acknowledged that during the year in which the case was
pending, Murphy _ who is not a party in the lawsuit _ admitted that
he had seen Buchwald's proposal. But Murphy said he couldn't tell
whether it influenced him subconsciously in writing his own script
for ``Coming to America.''
   ``What they're claiming, I think, is that Eddie didn't
intentionally rip them off. But in his subconscious, he ripped them
off,'' Draper said in his opening statement.
   A Memphis, Tenn., man, Laurence Armour, filed a $40 million
lawsuit in January against Murphy, claiming the movie's plot was
stolen from him and writer Shelby Gregory also has claimed the
story as his.

<HEAD>Party Draft Calls for Multiparty System, Membership in the EC</HEAD>

   The Communist Party proposed a
multiparty system, free elections and full membership in Western
economic institutions, including the European Community, according
to a declaration drafted Friday.
   ``The end to the authoritiarian socialism has come,'' said the
declaration, which also called for constitutional guarantees to
bring market-oriented economic reform, establish an independent
judiciary and protect human rights.
   The document, prepared for adoption at next month's national
party congress and published by the Borba daily, appears to be
Yugoslavia's reply to the wave of democratic reforms currently
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``The communist party of Yugoslavia supports freedom of
assembly, speech and all other civil liberties, regardless of
political convictions of individuals,'' said the document released
by a preparatory committee.
   Political ``associations, movements or parties will depend on
the will of the citizens, whose freedom of choice must be
guaranteed by the constitution,'' the declaration stated.
   It said that the communist party will no longer retain its
monopoly on power and will participate along with other parties in
``free, direct and secret elections.''
   ``We are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow will
not be too late for socialism in Yugoslavia,'' the document stated,
adding that the reforms should be implemented within six months
after the congress.
   Until now, the Communist leadership of Yugoslavia's largest
republic of Serbia was the staunchest opponent of Western-style
democracy in Yugoslavia. But at its congress on Friday Serbia's
Communist Party appeared to have softened its hard-line stance.
   Communists and Serbian authorities ``have no reason or wish to
administratively impede the establishment of (independent)
political parties'' in the republic, said Bogdan Trifunovic, the
region's party chief, in his keynote address.
   Serbia's rejection of Western-style democracy has been shared to
date by Yugoslavia's military, which contended that opposition
parties would be formed along ethnic lines, thus fueling ethnic
tensions.
   However, Gen. Ivo Tominc on Friday was quoted by the official
Tanjug news agency as saying that ``the army would not stand in the
way of the country's democratic development'' and that it would
``adjust itself to the changes in the society.''
   The second-largest republic of Croatia and liberal northern
Slovenia have already endorsed parliamentary democracy and are both
scheduled to hold free legeslative elections next spring.
   Independent movements and parties have been formed in Croatia
and Slovenia in the past year. Despite resistance from authorities
several opposition groups have also sprung up in Serbia, Bosnia,
Macedonia and Montenegro, where Communists have in the past tried
to sidestep democratic reforms.
   The draft congress declaration also said Yugoslavia will seek
``full participation in integration processes in Europe and
membership in the European Community, the Council of Europe, the
European Free Trade Association and other similar organizations and
institutions.''
   Yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its
one-party system.
   But political, economic, social and ethnic problems have
mushroomed since the death in 1980 of President Josip Broz Tito,
whose charisma was seen as a major force in bounding together the
divergent ethnic groups in the country.
   In an unprecedented move, Serbia last month severed all business
and political ties with Slovenia after authorities there banned an
anti-Slovenian rally planned by thousands of Serbs.
   The Serbian move was generally seen as an attempt to isolate
Slovenia and prevent its liberal ideas from spreading all over the
rest of the country.
   ``The economic blockade of Slovenia ... is contrary to the
implementation of economic and political reforms and the reform of
the party in Yugoslavia,'' said Gen. Tominc in the first open army
criticism of the Serbian move, according to Tanjug.

<HEAD>Administration Decides To Put Hold On EPA-Corps Agreement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement between the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers that would have
begun to carry out President Bush's campaign pledge to preserve
wetlands will be held up for 30 days, the administration announced
Friday.
   The two agencies ``will use the extension to allow for
explanations and discussion with federal agencies that have raised
concerns about the agreement,'' and to ``clear up any
misunderstandings about the purpose of the memorandum,'' EPA said
in a statement.
   The memorandum of agreement, which was reached in early November
and scheduled to take effect Friday, has caused a split within the
administration. The departments of Energy and Transportation oppose
the agreement and the Council on Environmental Quality and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are in favor.
   The Interior Department denied reports that the agreement had
sparked a fight in the department between the Fish and Wildlife
Service and the Minerals Management Service. Spokesman Steven
Goldstein said ``The only concerns we have are procedural.''
   Bush had promised during the campaign to strive for a goal of
``no net loss'' of wetlands.
   In a letter to Bush on Thursday, the president of the National
Wildlife Federation said the way in which the White House handles
the EPA-Corps agreement ``will demonstrate whether or not you are
truly commited to a national wetland policy of no net loss.''
   ``There is no middle ground on this one. It's either up or
down,'' wrote Jay Hair.
   The agreement has faced stiff criticism from the oil industry in
Alaska and the Alaska congressional delegation, who fear it could
disrupt oil and gas production on the North Slope and cripple that
state's economy. Gov. Steve Cowper has threatened to sue if the
agreement isn't changed.
   Many conservationists have grown increasingly concerned about
the disappearance of wetlands such as swamps, bogs, marshes,
potholes on the Great Plains and tidal estuaries.
   According to some estimates, up to 400,000 acres of wetlands per
year have been lost in recent decades to housing devlopments,
farms, shopping centers, highways and other encroachments of a
modern economy.
   But wetlands buffer floods, purify streams and provide wildlife
habitat for many species that can't life elsewhere.
   Federal law requires that the Corps grant a permit before
developers may put fill in most wetlands. EPA may challenge the
decision and has certain veto powers over it, and the two agencies
frequently had been at odds.
   The Corps agreed in the memorandum to ``strive to avoid adverse
impacts and offset unavoidable adverse impacts to existing aquatic
resources, and for wetlands, will strive to acheive a goal of no
overall net loss of values and functions.''
   The EPA, in its statement, said the memorandum ``does not define
a `no net loss' policy, but rather establishes a clear sequence of
actions to be considered in the (existing) permit-review process.''
   Under the agreement, permit applicants would first have to seek
alternatives to disturbing wetlands and if none were available
would have to work to minimize damege to wetlands.
   If the project would still cause significant harm, the applicant
would have to compensate for the loss, perhaps by building new
wetlands or restoring, old, already damaged areas.

<HEAD>Bribery Trial Begins For Two Execs, Two Politicians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of the Recruit Co., accused of bribing
officials by selling them cut-rate stock shares, went on trial
Friday along with a former aide and two politicians in a scandal
that toppled two governments.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, whose publishing conglomerate became the name of
the scandal, told Judge Tadatsugu Watanabe and a team of some 20
prosecutors that his gifts of discount shares and cash to
influential public figures were not meant as bribes.
   The 53-year-old Ezoe and former Recruit executive Toshiro Ono,
39, both said they had ``absolutely no intention of bribery,'' but
apologized for the trouble resulting from the Recruit scandal,
which brought down two prime ministers and has severely shaken
public confidence in the nation's leadership.
   Takao Fujinami, a former key Cabinet minister, and Katsuya
Ikeda, formerly a lawmaker with the opposition Komeito (Clean
Government) party also pleaded innocent to receiving bribes from
Recruit but begged forgiveness for getting involved in the scandal.
   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years in
prison.
   Their trial is the last of five trials against 12 executives and
ex-public officials that began last month as the Tokyo District
Court delves into allegations of corruption in the nation's elite.
   The Recruit scandal, which began in the summer of 1988, brought
down Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and his successor, Sousuke
Uno. Coupled with an unpopular sales tax, it remains a serious
problem for the governing conservative party, which faces a general
election sometime next year.
   In the packed courtroom Friday, Ezoe responded to prosecutors'
accusations by denying that he provided political donations and
cut-rate shares to Fujinami and Ikeda as bribes to win favors from
them. Prosecutors must prove the intention of bribery in order to
get convictions.
   Along with the other three defendants, he accused prosecutors of
forcing him to admit to bribery charges under duress. ``The
prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I tried to
close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the point that
they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said.
   ``I was questioned for over 20 hours and suffered physical and
mental damage,'' said Ezoe's former aide Ono, who also protested
his innocence.
   Ezoe is being tried on seven counts of bribery and Ono on two
counts.
   Fujinami, 57, who was chief Cabinet secretary when Recruit was
allegedly seeking to win special treatment for its fast-growing
employment-information and telecommunications businesses, admitted
he received from Recruit $140,000 and 10,000 shares in its real
estate subsidiary Recruit-Cosmos.
   But he said he didn't personally accept the gifts or provide
special favors to Ezoe.
   ``I would never think of doing that in my position as chief
Cabinet secretary,'' Fujinami said in his brief statement. Due to
his involvement in the scandal, Fujinami has left the Liberal
Democratic Party but retains his seat in Parliament.
   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to
hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the
stocks were available to the general public.
   When the shares hit the over-the-counter market, their price
shot up and the insiders made big profits. Fujinami's shares were
said to have earned him $215,000.
   Ezoe said Friday he had no idea the stocks would become so
valuable after their release to the public.
   Ikeda, 52, who resigned from Parliament over the scandal,
vehemently denied having any connection with Recruit and said he
had not personally accepted $49,000 in political donations or the
5,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares supplied to his brother.
   Prosecutors' charges that he gave speeches in Parliament as a
favor to Recruit were ``absolutely untrue,'' Ikeda said. ``I gave
those speeches on my own initiative and based on my personal
convictions.''
   Prosecutors presented hundreds of pages of evidence against the
four defendants in the trial, which is expected to drag on for
years as the legal system considers the fine line between cordial
business-government ties and outright corruption.

   Moslem separatists celebrating the
release of five radicals in exchange for a government minister's
kidnapped daughter hurled gasoline bombs at police Friday in
clashes that killed five people.
   Curfews were imposed in five towns of the northern state of
Jammu-Kashmir after widespread violence and to stop Moslem
separatists from demonstrating after Wednesday's swap. Security
forces were told to shoot violators.
   Officials said two people were killed and 30 others were injured
in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir with a population
of 700,000. The Moslem-majority state lies on the Pakistan border.
   Officers opened fired in the town of Anantnag when mobs hurled
stones and gasoline bombs on police barricades, said Shoaib S. Ali,
deputy inspector general of the state police.
   In Shupiyan, crowds burned a forest office building and attacked
police contingents. Police fatally shot three men and wounded 30
others, said Divisional Commissioner Mohammad Shafi Pandit, a
senior government official.
   Curfews were imposed in Sopore and Baramullah on Thursday after
separatist violence left two teen-agers dead and 50 others injured.
   Security forces were ordered to shoot curfew violators Friday,
Ali said. Soldiers have been posted in all five towns, he said.
   Five militants of the Kashmir Liberation Front were released
Wednesday in exchange for the Rubaiya Sayeed, held hostage since
her abduction by the separatist group Dec. 8.
   Ms. Sayeed, 22, is a medical intern at a Srinagar hospital and
the youngest daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, a
Kashmiri and the first Moslem to be named to the sensitive post
that oversees police and internal security.
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said the release of the militants was
not ``bowing to terrorists,'' but a decision that took into account
``the overall situation.''
   He said the new government, formed Dec. 2, will assess the
situation in the state but was not in favor of precipitate action
becuase ``it is a delicate situation.''
   The Kashmir Liberation Front, formed in 1965, wants
Jammu-Kashmir to secede from India and become either independent or
merge with Islamic Pakistan.
   Moslems make up 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people
but only about 12 percent of the country's 880 million people.
Hindus account for about 80 percent of the population.
   Kashmir, the northwestern region of the state, is claimed by
both India and Pakistan, and the two countries have fought three
wars over the territory since gaining independence from Britain in
1947.
   A cease-fire line monitored by the United Nations separates the
state into Indian and Pakistani territory.

<HEAD>Parents Who Abandon Babies May be Overwhelmed by Holidays, Experts
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three infants abandoned in the area in 10
days, including one found with a poignant note, may have been left
by their parents because of financial and emotional pressures of
the season, specialists said Friday.
   ``It would seem that somebody who abandons a newborn is somebody
who's totally overwhelmed and feels they have no resources,'' said
Irene Goldenberg, a family psychologist at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric
Institute. ``Abandoning a baby is a case of pure panic. It's like a
suicidal impulse.''
   The three infants, now in foster homes, seem to support findings
that child abandonment has grown as much as 300 percent since 1980.
   On Wednesday, a 5-month-old boy was found behind a state
Disability Insurance Claims Office building along with a note that
said, ``Dear friends, please look after my son. ... I simply can't
give him the kind of care he deserves. I know you can.'' It was
written by the father, who signed his name but has not been located.
   The same day, a man who stepped into the morning cold to get his
newspaper found a newborn girl wrapped in blue cloth and placed
inside a cardboard box in a gutter. Hospital workers named the
infant Noel.
   A girl believed to be 2 to 3 days old was found Dec. 7 at a
motel in suburban Van Nuys, apparently left on a bed by a young
couple who told the hotel desk they needed to rent a room briefly,
police said. The only clue to her identity was the paper hospital
gown decorated with pink-and-blue teddy bears she wore.
   While experts don't see a rise in child abandonment during the
holiday season, they say that a time of merriment and celebration
of family unity can prompt feelings of severe depression and
hopelessness fron those without support.
   People who give up their children in hopes that a stranger will
give them a better life may be relying on the Christmas spirit of
giving, said Sylvia Pizzini of the Child Welfare Services program
of the California State Department of Social Services.
   ``People may feel others are more generous at Christmas,'' she
said. ``They count on the spirit of goodwill.''
   As police officers searched for the parents of the three
foundlings, Los Angeles social workers on Friday held the annual
Adoption Day, on which 25 families received adoption decrees for 28
children.
   Many public and private agencies offer adoption services where
parents can surrender children they are unable to care for, but
people continue to abandon children anonymously because they are
ashamed of their inability to raise the child, said Alex Morales,
spokesman for the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles. The bureau
places abandoned children in foster homes.
   ``It is so much more socially negative to make that move,'' he
said. ``It's somehow more permissible to leave a child with a note.
Maybe what goes on in the mother's mind is that she takes this step
because of the social stigma that she's not a good mother.''
   Morales said although babies being left on doorsteps get far
more publicity, many parents leave their children with strangers or
relatives and disappear, only to return later to claim the child.
   ``It seems like drugs are playing a big part in that
phenomenon,'' Morales said. ``We see children abandoned because a
parent is so caught up in their drug involvement they can't attend
to the needs of their children.''
   After children are placed in foster homes or relatives are given
custody, the parent returns to be reunited with his or her child,
only to disappear again later, he said.
   ``Often they are locatable, which leads you to conclude that
they want to be found,'' said Ms. Pizzini. ``That biological tie is
there through thick and thin.''

<TEXT>
   The roads and hillsides winding through
Antietam National Battlefield are to be softly lit Saturday night
with 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or
missing after the Civil War's bloodiest battle.
   ``It's a memorial and Christmas is the season of lights. We just
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' Richard
Rambur, battlefield superintendent, said Friday. ``Everybody talks
about 23,000, but not very many people really have an idea of how
many that is.''
   Up to 5,000 automobilies are expected to join a 4.5-mile tour of
the battlefield near Sharpsburg, about 70 miles west of Baltimore.
Candles glowing inside lunch-sized paper bags filled with sand will
outline the roadways and others will dot the snow-covered
3,200-acre battleground.
   More men were killed or wounded at Antietam on Sept. 17, 1862,
than on any other single day of the Civil War. Union losses were
12,410 and Confederate losses totaled 10,700. It was the single
bloodiest day of American military history.
   ``You're really going to get an impression of what kind of
impact that was,'' Rambur said. ``When they drive through here,
they're going to feel something, I'm sure.''
   In addition to the bags of lighted candles, choirs will be
singing at various spots in the battlefield, including the Dunker
Church, the focal point of repeated clashes as both armies sought
to occupy and control high ground at the site.
   A Civil War-era encampment, complete with uniformed re-enactors,
recaptures the atmosphere of a wintertime camp 127 years ago. The
soldiers will gather at Bloody Lane, a sunken road near the center
of the battlefield where four hours of fighting left more than
5,000 dead or injured.
   Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of
Antietam, but the conflict climaxed the first of Confederate
general Robert E. Lee's two attempts to carry the war into the
North. The battle also gave President Abraham Lincoln an
opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all
slaves in the United States in 1863.
   An estimated 500 volunteers from church and civic groups,
historical organizations, scouting troops and area businesses have
assembled the lights, said Washington County Tourism Director Bob
O'Connor. The battlefield was divided into 23 grids and groups
assigned to each section are responsible for arranging and lighting
1,000 candles and retrieving them after the five-hour display.
   All 23,110 tapers will be lit in the 30 minutes between dusk and
dark, O'Connor said. ``We don't know of any (battlefield) where
this has been done to this magnitude,'' he said.
   Rambur said organizers are encouraging volunteers to maintain a
somber attitude while lighting the candles.
   ``This is a memorial and we're trying to stress that. We do not
want Santa Clauses and that kind of thing,'' Rambur said. ``If we
learn anything from the battlefields, it is that there just has to
be another answer to war.''

   Labor Minister Jacek Kuron, one of the
founders of the Polish opposition movement and an adviser to Lech
Walesa, has been hospitalized after a slight heart attack, his
office said Friday.
   Kuron, 55, was resting in a government hospital but expected to
be back to work after Christmas.
   The gravelly voiced activist has taken to holding Tuesday night
television chats to keep Poles abreast of the Solidarity-led
government's economic reform plans and urge them to help one
another in the difficult financial times ahead.
   Doctors discovered that Kuron had suffered a heart attack
Tuesday while he was having a lung examination, and Kuron was taken
to the hospital immediately.
   Kuron served nine years in prison for his anti-government
activities. He joined the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki in September.

   The last U.S. troops
sent to restore order on St. Croix after Hurricane Hugo began
pulling out Friday, an official said.
   All 170 members of the 276th and 471st Washington, D.C.,
National Guard military police units will leave the island by
Saturday, said National Guard spokeswoman Maj. Phyllis
Phipps-Barnes.
   The National Guardsmen arrived a month ago to take over from
1,100 federal troops sent by President Bush three days after the
Sept. 17 storm to restore order and stop looting.
   The storm destroyed most buildings and homes here and caused $1
billion in damages. Due to a near complete absence of local
authority, for three days following the hurricane looters cleaned
out most businesses and food stores.
   A senior officer of the Virgin Islands National Guard, who asked
not to be identified, said local police and Guardsmen could handle
security on the island now. ``There is no need for outside troops
to be on St. Croix,'' he said.
   The stateside units helped local officials in joint patrols and
maintaining an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, in effect since the storm.
   The withdrawal of the 1,100 troops ordered by Gov. Alexander
Farrelly in November outraged business leaders and the Chamber of
Commerce, who asked the White House to keep the troops there until
power and telephones were restored.
   Power is still out to 60 percent of the island's 55,000
residents, while 400 local and stateside linesmen are working to
restore downed power lines.

<HEAD>Anti-Drug Measure Ruled Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A circuit judge has ruled that the city's
year-old loitering ordinance, aimed at street drug dealers, is
unconstitutional.
   The law is vague and overbroad, and violates the Fourth and 14th
Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Brevard Circuit Judge John
Antoon decided this week. The Fourth Amendment gives citizens
rights against unreasonable search and seizure and the 14th
Amendment guarantees the right to due process for any U.S. citizen.
   The ordinance, adopted in December 1988, made it unlawful to
loiter in or near Melbourne's streets or public places in a manner
for engaging in drug-related activities.
   Melbourne city officials stand by the law, which was closely
modeled after a long-standing ordinance adopted in Tacoma, Wash.,
that had withstood scrutiny.
   ``We wouldn't have adopted the ordinance if we had not felt it
would meet that test,'' City Manager Samuel Halter said Thursday.
   City Attorney Jim Reinman plans to meet with Brevard-Seminole
State Attorney Norm Wolfinger within the next week to discuss an
appeal, Halter said.
   Only one person had been charged under the ordinance, and the
case against him was dropped when the officer who arrested the man
left the Police Department and failed to appear in court, Halter
said.
   Antoon wrote in his order: ``While the city has passed this
legislation with the noble goal of reducing drug-related crime, it
has also given law enforcement and the state `carte blanche'
authority to prosecute innocent people exercising fundamental,
personal liberties.''

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Catholic gubernatorial candidate's switch to
a pro-abortion stance prompted Ohio's Catholic bishops Friday to
criticize politicians who personally oppose abortion while
tolerating it publicly.
   ``We cannot judge the state of anyone's conscience before God.
We control no votes except the ones we cast personally,'' said a
statement read by Cincinnati Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk at a news
conference at St. Peter in Chains Cathedral.
   ``But it is clear to us that, objectively speaking, the
tolerance of abortion in our society and the refusal to allow
religious and moral principles to influence public life are
positions which are both morally and socially wrong,'' the
statement said.
   Pilarczyk, who is president of the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, said the Ohio group's statement was prompted by
gubernatorial candidate Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze
Jr.'s change from an anti-abortion to pro-choice public position.
   Celebrezze, a Democrat and Catholic, announced his position
switch Dec. 2, then announced his candidacy for governor Monday. He
said he still personally opposes abortion.
   Many politicians have grown fearful of jeopardizing their
candidacies with anti-abortion stands. In California last month, an
underdog Catholic candidate for the state Assembly won a narrow
victory after a bishop barred her from taking communion because of
her support for abortion rights.
   Celebrezze was followed by anti-abortion pickets this week as he
opened his campaign for the 1990 Democratic nomination with
appearances in 14 cities. Concluding his tour Friday in
Springfield, he said he values the bishops' opinion but sees
abortion as an issue of individual vs. government choice.
   ``I respect the bishops tremendously,'' Celebrezze said. ``The
question here is what makes good public policy. I think we need to
do a lot more to prevent unwanted pregnancies.
   ``I strongly oppose abortion. The issue that people are reacting
to ... is who makes that decision. I believe it's an intensely
personal decision to be made by the woman with the advice of a
doctor, family, friends, whomever. But the government should not
make that decision.''
   Pilarczyk is chairman of the Ohio Catholic Conference, which
includes bishops from all of Ohio's six dioceses. He said the
statement, which did not refer to Celebrezze by name, was intended
for all holding or seeking public office.
   ``This is not just addressed to Mr. Celebrezze. ... One might
say that Mr. Celebrezze was the occasion of it, but he was not the
cause of it,'' Pilarczyk said in an interview.
   ``It's intended for all those to whom it applies. It's intended
to teach what the church teaches, and it's intended to teach those
in public life that they should not attempt to divorce moral
principle from public policy.''
   Signing the statement with Pilarczyk were the other diocesan
bishops in Ohio: James A. Griffin, Columbus; James R. Hoffman,
Toledo; James W. Malone, Youngstown; Albert H. Ottenweller,
Steubenville; and Anthony M. Pilla, Cleveland.
   The statement was also signed by Andrew Pataki, bishop of the
Eastern Rite church in Parma, and Louis Puscas, head of the
Romanian Rite church in Akron.

   A six-member House delegation returned Friday
from secret meetings with Colombian President Virgilio Barco and
said they had seen a nation trying to resist intimidation by a
handful of cocaine traffickers.
   The congressmen praised Barco for his courage as a rash of
bombings and assassinations masterminded by drug lords and chips
away at the Colombian judicial system.
   ``You have to be there to understand the kind of fear that we
saw,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., told reporters.
   ``Colombia is indeed a battlefield,'' said Rep. Frank Guarini,
D-N.J., who noted Barco's desire for American help in attacking
money laundering, reducing the demand for cocaine and keeping
assault weapons from entering the country.
   All agreed that despite death threats against top Colombian
officials, President Bush should go ahead with plans to attend a
Feb. 15 drug summit in Colombia to demonstrate U.S. support for
Barco's battle.
   ``We will collect our forces in the Congress to provide the type
of resources that will be necessary to make this war victorious,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who led the visit, which was
requested by Barco and supported by the State Department.
   ``We will take our struggle to the United Nations, to the
Organization of American States, to our allies in Europe and
Japan,'' Rangel said.
   The lawmakers, all members of the House Narcotics Abuse and
Control Committee, also met with Colombia's defense and justice
ministers, the national police director, the attorney general,
Colombian presidential candidates and U.S. Ambassador Thomas
McNamara.
   ``In our meetings with them, it was apparent their determination
and the determination of the courts was there'' to apprehend drug
traffickers and clamp down on the production of cocaine and crack,
said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., the ranking Republican on the
committee.
   Rangel, the panel's chairman, was joined by Reps. Benjamin A.
Gilman, R-N.Y., and Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   Aides kept the two-day trip secret out of concerns that the
congressmen could become the targets of cocaine traffickers, who
have been blamed for a rash of violence that has wracked Bogota,
the capital.
   Among those killed have been 50 judges, two newspaper
publishers, the chief of the narcotics police and a leading
presidential candidate. A bombing earlier this month wounded an
estimated 1,000 people.
   Barco traveled to Washington Sept. 28-29 for discussions with
Bush and House leaders about American cooperation with the war on
drug traffickers he declared three months ago. The United States
has asked the Colombian government to extradite suspected
traffickers indicted in this country on drug charges.

   Mayor Tom Bradley's daughter Phyllis, who has
a history of arrests on drug-related charges and traffic
violations, was held briefly Friday for investigation of drunken
driving.
   Ms. Bradley, 44, refused a sobriety test until after her arrest
and until she had spoken to Bradley, police said. She was arrested
after allegedly making an illegal U-turn, said Sgt. Gary Lynch.
   The arresting officer smelled alcohol on her breath, police
said, but they refused to release the results of the sobriety test
she finally took.
   She received no special treatment and had to wait in line to be
booked at the Wilshire District police station, police said. She
was released about two hours after her arrest after police found
she had no outstanding warrants.
   An arraignment was scheduled Jan. 5 in traffic court.
   ``I was picked up at Pico and Crenshaw for being under the
influence of alcohol,'' Ms. Bradley told reporters after being
released. ``This has happened before.''
   Ms. Bradley's previous run-ins with the law include guilty pleas
to felony counts of driving while under the influence of PCP,
possession of PCP and injuring another person in 1983. She was
placed on probation and ordered to enter a drug rehabilitation
program.

<HEAD>Havel Calls for Justice, Not Revenge Against Communists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition activist Vaclav Havel
said Friday that if he is elected Czechoslovakia's first
non-Communist president in four decades he will try to prevent a
Communist witch hunt.
   ``There must be justice, but not revenge,'' said Havel, the
playwright and leader of the opposition Civic Forum, in an
interview with the state news agency CTK. ``I would try my best to
avoid a witch hunt in this country. Including Communists.''
   His comments followed word of a deepening split inside the
ruling party between hard-line and reform-minded members that could
lead to the establishment of a new democratic party.
   ``The Communist Party has 1.7 million members, all of them are
our compatriots and there are countless people among them who are
among the same as we are and who want this country to live in
democracy,'' said Havel.
   Rudolf Prevratil, spokesman for the recently founded reform
Communist group Democratic Forum, told CTK that next week's party
congress ``will show whether this movement can live inside the
Communist Party.''
   Reform members of the party are anxious to distance themselves
from the discredited regime of ex-party chief Milos Jakes and
former hard-line President Gustav Husak, who resigned last Sunday
after swearing in Czechoslovakia's first government not dominated
by Communists in 41 years.
   Since then, a dispute has developed over how to elect the
president. Under the constitution, the president is to be chosen by
the parliament within two weeks.
   But the Communist-dominated Parliament is reluctant to vote for
Havel, and is considering a proposal to throw the election open to
popular vote. Negotiations are under way to resolve the dispute
between the opposition and leaders of the Communist and other
smaller parties.
   A final resolution is not expected until after Parliament
reconvenes Dec. 19 and an extraordinary party congress is held next
Wednesday and Thursday.
   The interview with Havel is the first in a series to be
conducted by the state news agency, which is moving toward greater
independence from the Communist Party.
   ``The real presidential campaign has begun,'' the agency said,
adding that interviews would be conducted with all those considered
leading contenders.
   These include Alexander Dubcek, architect of the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms who was ousted in 1969 after the Soviet invasion;
Cestmir Cisar, the student candidate for president in 1968, later
expelled from the Communist Party; and Ladislav Adamec,
Czechoslovakia's prime minister until Nov. 7.
   Havel said he did not want the race to ``drive a wedge'' between
himself and Dubcek or between Czechs and Slovaks.
   He said his priority, if elected, would be to ``guard the quiet,
peaceful and dignified nature of the social movement, which some
call a revolution'' and not let it be sullied by ``intrigue,
politicking and all kinds of dirt.''

   Crowder said the national quota will be allocated to each state

<TEXT>
   Roseanne Barr, television's sharp-tongued
comedy mom of the 1980s, called off her January wedding, saying in
a terse statement Friday that her boyfriend was in a drug
rehabilitation clinic.
   ``My January 20 marriage to Tom Arnold is off,'' Miss Barr said.
``Tom has entered an alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic.''
   The statement was the only comment from the star of
``Roseanne,'' said her publicist Lisa Kasteler. The name and
location of the rehabilitation clinic was confidential and the type
of addiction wasn't disclosed.
   The temperamental Miss Barr, 36, recently protested the firing
of Arnold, a writer and comic, as a consultant to the show.
   The couple went to great lengths in recent months to express
their devotion during appearances together on TV shows. During
taping of ``A Current Affair'' in August, Arnold dropped his pants
and exposed a backside tattoo reading, ``Rosey.''
   In a November Redbook interview, Arnold said he and Miss Barr
planned to marry and move into a large house, ``big enough so that
Rosey's kids can comfortably live there, as well as any others we
might have.''
   Kasteler, who has spoken for the couple for months, said she did
not know where Arnold could be reached for comment.
   Miss Barr's first motion picture outing, ``She-Devil'' with
Meryl Streep, placed fourth in this week's box office derby with a
disappointing $3.5 million take.

<HEAD>FDA Wants To Ban Use Of Word `Hormone' On Skin Product Labels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration wants to
prohibit manufacturers from using the word ``hormone'' on the
labels of nonprescription skin products.
   Labeling such as ``hormone cream'' implies that the product has
a therapeutic effect by altering the structure or function of the
body, the FDA said.
   However, the agency said that while nonprescription skin creams
can contain hormones, they are at low levels that have not been
shown to have any therapeutic effect.
   Under the FDA's proposed ban, manufacturers could not refer to
their products as ``hormone creams'' or say they contain
``hormones.'' But they would be allowed to include in their regular
listing of ingredients the names of hormones in the product, as
long as they are not listed prominently.
   The FDA has published the proposal in the Federal Register but a
final rule is not expected to be issued for a year, a spokeswoman
said.
   The ban would take effect six months after the final rule is
published, but the FDA is asking manufacturers to comply
voluntarily with the proposal before the rule becomes final.

   Up to 30 inches of new snow and intense cold iced roads and
closed hundreds of schools Friday from the Rockies to the
Appalachians, and even forced postponement of a ceremony to
dedicate an airport's new snow removal equipment.
   Temperatures hit record lows in more than two dozen cities in
Iowa, Kansas, North and South Dakota, Michigan, Oklahoma, Nebraska,
Missouri, and Illinois, and the wind chill effect at Moline, Ill.,
was 49 degrees below zero.
   The official low for the lower 48 states was 30 degrees below
zero at Chadron, Neb., and at 2 p.m. the temperature at Lemmon,
S.D., was still only 11 below zero, the National Weather Service
said.
   ``We're draining all the cold weather out of Alaska, the
Northwest Territories and northern Canada,'' said National Weather
Service forecaster James Vermoch in Chicago. ``We're bringing it
right down the pipe.''
   Up to 30 inches of snow fell in northeastern Wisconsin's Door
County in two days, with 25 inches in the same period around
Sheridan, Wyo.
   Generally 3 to 6 inches fell during the night and through Friday
from Kansas to West Virginia, with storm watches posted into
Saturday in the Northeast. And snow had begun falling from
southwestern New York state to North Carolina and Tennessee. In
addition to the heavy snow at Sheridan, Wyo., lesser amounts fell
elsewhere in that state and up to 18 inches fell in the Colorado
Rockies.
   Schools were closed Friday in parts of Wyoming, Kansas,
Missouri, Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky
and West Virginia. One Iowa school closed for lack of heat.
   Numerous school, business, social and sporting events were
canceled.
   Two deaths were blamed on the snow and slippery roads in Indiana.
   Authorities at the Wheeling-Ohio County Airport in West
Virginia's Northern Panhandle had planned to dedicate $170,000 in
snow removal equipment Friday, but that had to be postponed, said
Airport Manager Thomas Tominack.
   ``Actually, the equipment is currently being utilized to clean
the runways and we can't really take the time to have the
dedications,'' Tominack said. ``Priorities are such that we need to
get our runways clean.''
   Plunging temperatures and surface freezing on roads prompted
Kentucky's government to shut down at mid-morning Friday, sending
thousands of state employees home.
   Greater Cincinnati International Airport closed for an hour to
permit removal of snow from the runway. Delta Air Lines canceled 12
flights there.
   Gusty north wind and the cold broke power lines in Kansas,
blacking out more than 3,000 customers for a time in parts of
Wichita and Leavenworth, utility officials said.
   That wind also created wind chill effect readings across Kansas
from 25 below zero to 45 below.
   Record lows included 26 below zero at Dickinson, N.D.; 19 below
at Dubuque, Iowa; 16 below at Burlington and Carroll, Iowa and
Concordia, Kan. The low of 15 below at Salina, Kan., bettered a
record that had been on the books since 1901.
   Farther north, chronically cold International Falls, Minn., on
the Canadian border, had a low of 18 below zero.
   Up to 6 inches of snow in the Cincinnati area brought much of
the morning rush hour traffic to a halt. Across the Ohio River,
Interstate 71-75 at Covington, Ky., was closed in both directions
while crews attempted to clear the most dangerous, hilly stretch of
highway. Many people whose cars stalled or ran out of gas during
the up to two-hour delay abandoned their cars at the roadside.
   Slippery pavement in Brooklyn Center, Minn., a Minneapolis
suburb, led to a 20-car pileup Friday on Interstate 94. One minor
injury was reported.
   Ski resort operators generally welcome snow, but heavy snow in
Wyoming's Big Horn Mountains prevented the Antelope Butte ski
resort from opening this weekend as planned, according to the
resort's owners.
   As of Thursday morning, 30 inches of snow had been dumped on the
resort in north-central Wyoming, and that closed roads to the
resort, Allison Scott said Thursday.
   But the equally heavy snow on flatter terrain in Wisconsin's
Door County, a peninsula jutting into Lake Michigan, was welcomed.
   ``There is enough snow in the county to provide every man, woman
and child with at least 100 snowballs,'' said Wally Blevins,
executive vice president of the Door County Chamber of Commerce.

<HEAD>Study Finds Deepening Hardship Among Latino Families, Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly one-fifth of Hispanic families are
living in poverty as the decade ends, according to a study released
Friday that contends the economic expansion of the 1980s has least
benefited U.S. Latinos.
   The study by the National Council of La Raza found widespread
poverty among Hispanic families led by women, deepening hardships
for married-couple families and significant numbers of poor Latino
children.
   ``Hispanics made many gains in the 1980s, politically and
socially, especially in visibility and growth,'' said La Raza
president Raul Yzaguirre. ``But unfortunately, the economic picture
for Hispanics worsened at the same time.''
   La Raza, a non-profit Hispanic research and advocacy
organization, said Hispanics were concentrated in low-wage jobs,
overrepresented in industries with declining employment and more
likely to lose their jobs through plant closings.
   Hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country,
with only 51 percent of Latinos 25 and older completing four years
of high school or more, compared with 78 percent of non-Hispanics.
   The increasing number of Hispanic families led by women is also
a factor, as those families tend to be poor, the study said. In
1980, 21.8 percent of Hispanic families were led by women, but by
1988, women-led families accounted for 23.4 percent of Hispanic
families.
   While 19 percent of Hispanic married-couple families with
children were poor in 1988, 59 percent of women-led families were
poor, the study said.
   Among whites, 6.4 percent of married-couple families were poor,
while 38.2 percent of women-led families were living in poverty
last year, said the study, which was based on Census Bureau data.
   Among blacks, 12.5 percent of married-couple families were poor,
while 56.3 percent of women-led families were in poverty.
   The study said 12.9 percent of white families were led by women
in 1988, while 43.5 percent of black families were headed by women.
   The study found Hispanic married-couple families had median
incomes of $25,769 in 1988, significantly lower than the incomes
earned by black married-couple families, $30,424, and of whites,
$36,883.
   The 1980s were also a period of significant poverty among
children, the study said, and Hispanic children were among the
hardest hit.
   The study found 44.2 percent of black children living in poverty
last year, compared with 37.9 percent for Hispanic children and
14.6 percent for whites.
   The study said the concentration of Hispanics in low-wage,
unstable jobs was one of the most significant factors contributing
to Latinos' economic disadvantages in the 1980s.
   About one-third of all employed Hispanics work in agriculture,
mining, manufacturing and private households, while one-fifth of
the entire workforce is employed in those areas.
   The study said evidence also indicates Hispanics have
experienced significant levels of employment discrimination
throughout the decade.
   The Hispanic population has grown from 14.5 million to 20.1
million from 1980 to 1989, accounting for 8.2 percent of the total
U.S. population. Hispanics make up 7.6 percent of the U.S.
workforce.

   If Gov. James R. Thompson glanced out a
bay window of the 40-room Governor's Mansion on Friday, he could a
homeless shelter opening across the street.
   What does the governor, who only spends about a third of his
time in the Greek Revival mansion, think about the shelter?
   ``It's in a good location,'' Thompson said earlier this week.
   He said he plans to volunteer soon at the shelter, a two-room
building.
   ``If we're neighbors ... I think it would be a great thing to
do,'' Thompson said.
   The shelter came to the neighborhood after downtown businesses
were reluctant to rent space for it, said Dick Lofgren in Mayor
Ossie Langfelder's office, which is enthusiastic about the facility
being run by Helping Hands of Springfield, a volunteer group.
   The Young Women's Christian Association offered use of its
vacant building, which had been used for storage, and the state
provided $46,000, Lofgren said.
   On Friday afternoon, volunteers were painting the walls and
sweeping floors. Homeless people were expected later in the day at
the shelter, which will offer soup, donuts and coffee.
   ``They've been constantly asking me, ever since they heard about
it, when it's going to open up,'' said volunteer Duane McShane.
   On Friday, the wait might have seemed particularly long. The
noon temperature was 4 degrees below zero _ 37 below with wind
chill factor, according to the National Weather Service.
   On any night, an estimated 30 to 50 homeless people are on the
streets of Springfield, Lofgren said.
   The shelter, which has a $50,000 annual budget, will be open 24
hours a day. It is intended to serve as an emergency shelter and
doesn't have beds.

   The Ku Klux Klan on Friday canceled a march
Saturday in support of two high school students who wore Klan-like
robes to school in a Halloween stunt, police said.
   Ron Lee of Morrow, who has identified himself as a Klan member,
told police the march was canceled because of a snowstorm, acting
Police Chief Richard McVey said. Lee said the Klan might try to
reschedule the march in the spring, McVey said.
   The Klan spokesmen said their rally was to have been in protest
of the suspension of two students who wore robes to class on
Halloween and shouted racial slurs. White and black residents
staged a march Nov. 3 to protest the youths' behavior and to
promote racial harmony.
   Community leaders in Oxford, a southwestern Ohio college town of
about 20,000 people, had predicted that residents would largely
ignore the march. About 95 percent of the town's residents are
white.

   The last link of a $675 million freeway
has opened, more than 30 years after its proposal set off years of
bickering and court fights.
   The final link of the Walter P. Reuther Freeway opened to a
flood of cars Thursday evening. Reuther's daughter, Elizabeth
Dickmeyer, and the man who originally proposed Interstate 696,
former highway director John Mackie, attended the ceremony.
Reuther, a former president of the United Auto Workers union, died
in a 1970 plane crash.
   The final 9.1-mile section was finished this month and was the
last link of the 28.2-mile, $675 million freeway. The road is
expected to carry more than 100,000 vehicles daily at first with
that number growing to 170,000 daily, cutting east-west travel time
north of Detroit by as much as 30 minutes, state officials said.
   Interstate 696, which borders 16 cities, was first proposed in
1957.
   But the section between Interstate 75 and Lahser Road had to go
through seven communities, and it was up to them to decide which
routes to choose among five or six alternatives. They couldn't
agree, according to Paul Garceau, deputy district engineer for the
Michigan Department of Transportation.
   In 1966, then-Gov. George Romney held a marathon meeting with
the seven communities, but they still couldn't agree. Binding
arbitration upheld court challenges from the disgruntled
communities and eventually settled the route in 1968.
   But then the federal Environmental Protection Act of 1969, which
required environmental impact statements, further delayed
bid-letting on the last part of the freeway just completed.
   Land acquisition alone cost $81 million.

<UNK>City Will Test Bodies For Disease And Warn Contacts</UNK>

   An AIDS test will be routinely performed as part
of all autopsies in New York City, and the information will be used
to warn contacts of the deceased who may be at risk, health
officials said Friday.
   They emphasized that the identity of any body that tests
positive for HIV, the AIDS virus, would be kept confidential, as
required by the state's AIDS Confidentiality Law.
   Thus the medical examiner's office will not report names of
AIDS-positive corpses to the city Health Department. But it will
pass on such information as sex, race, age and neighborhood to help
studies of how and where the incurable disease is spreading, said
Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, the chief medical examiner.
   The only people to know names will be counselors who follow up
to warn sex or drug-abusing partners of the AIDS-positive dead that
they may have been exposed. The counselors will be trained and made
available to Hirsch by the Health Department, but will be under
Hirsch's command, said Dr. Stephen Joseph, city health commissioner.
   Hirsch's office estimated that at least 1,000 of the
approximately 8,000 post mortems performed annually will turn up
HIV infection. About 75,000 people die each year in New York, but
the medical examiner takes jurisdiction only in cases when deaths
are violent, suspicious, unexplained or occur without a doctor in
attendance.
   The AIDS testing will be put into effect at the medical
examiner's offices soon, after meetings with various AIDS advocacy
groups, said Ellen Borakove, speaking for Hirsch.
   The groups, representing racial, ethnic and social populations
hardest hit by AIDS, have generally resisted, on privacy grounds,
any forms of involuntary testing or disclosure.
   ``We're going to reserve comment until we find out just how it
is going to work,'' said Geoffrey Knox, spokesman for the Gay Men's
Health Crisis.
   Joseph developed the plan with Hirsch and said he could see no
sane reason to oppose it.
   ``What argument can anyone make to not warn the unsuspecting
partner of someone who is dead?'' said Joseph.
   He and Hirsch both have said that because of recent gains in
treating the disease, infected people reached early enough may
expect longer and better lives.

   President Elias Hrawi's government
threatened Friday to stop paying soldiers loyal to Gen. Michel
Aoun, who refuses to recognize the new administration and give up
control of the Christian heartland.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, appeled on televised
to Christians in east Beirut and the Christian-dominated coastal
zone to the north to renounce Aoun and help reunify Lebanon. He
said a new round of the 14-year civil war could begin at any time.
   ``My brother in the eastern area: I can guarantee that I am not
going to declare war on you, but I cannot guarantee that the war is
not going to explode again,'' Hoss said.
   Hrawi, 64, was elected president by Parliament on Nov. 24 with a
mandate to carry out a peace plan negotiated in October. Aoun, a
Maronite Catholic like Hrawi, has rejected the election and the
accord, demanding a specific timetable for withdrawal of the 40,000
Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   A government statement said future army payrolls would be
handled by Gen. Emile Lahoud, who was appointed army commander last
month after Hrawi dismissed Aoun.
   It said the Central Bank would not pay army salaries unless the
five brigade commanders in the Christian enclave submitted monthly
payrolls to Lahoud within five days.
   Hrawi controls the Central Bank, in Moslem west Beirut.
   Officials loyal to Aoun urged all institutions and employees to
``reject directives and instructions, which are null and void, from
those who deal with the occupiers,'' meaning the Syrians.
   The reference was to Hrawi's government, which is Syria and most
other governments support.
   Aoun became head of a Christian government after President Amin
Gemayel's term ended in September 1988 with Parliament unable to
agree on a successor. Hoss led a competing Moslem Cabinet until the
peace plan was worked out.
   In defiance of Hrawi, Aoun remains in his bunker beneath the
shell-battered presidential palace at Baabda, a Christian suburb
east of Beirut, and commands about 20,000 Christian troopers.
   In his televised appeal, Hoss told Christians he could not
guarantee peace ``as long as the secessionist movement led by
General Aoun exists. We have learned from past experience that wars
simply explode without anyone declaring them.''
   He called Aoun, 54, a ``mutineer who is leading the nation
toward final partition merely because he is hungry for power.''
   Most of Lebanon is controlled by Syria, whose soldiers are in
the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun and
the Syrians fought a six-month artillery war that was ended in
September by an Arab League cease-fire.
   Hrawi and Lahoud, who commands 22,000 Moslem soldiers, have
established temporary headquarters at Ablah in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon.

<HEAD>Private Researcher Criticizes Pesticide Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A widely circulated report by the National
Research Council on pesticides used by farmers included information
that was deficient, out-of-date and in some respects one-sided, a
private researcher said Friday.
   However, Leonard P. Gianessi of the Washington-based non-profit
Resources for the Future said that despite what he perceived as
shortcomings, the NRC report issued Sept. 7 ``makes an important
contribution to the debate'' over the use of chemical pesticides.
   ``Perhaps my expectation was that it would provide answers to
most of these questions as well. It doesn't,'' he said. ``It
probably should be viewed as an important first try to get on top
of this issue and not as the final word.''
   The 450-page NRC report cited case studies of farmers using
alternative methods of production without the indiscriminate use of
chemicals. Among its many proposals was one for Congress to revise
federal farm policies so that environmentally sound production
methods would be encouraged.
   Environmentalists and many others applauded the report, based on
a three-year $625,000 study by a 17-member committee. The Kellogg
Foundation put up $410,000 for the study, and other financing
included $80,000 from the Agriculture Department.
   Gianessi presented his paper at a briefing on the NRC report
held by Resources for the Future, an independent group founded in
1952. Its specialty is research in development, conservation and
use of natural resources.
   In his critique, Gianessi said the NRC _ a branch of the
National Academy of Sciences _ used case studies that were ``data
deficient'' in making its case for alternative ways of producing
farm crops and livestock.
   ``Information is often not presented for such key factors as:
How often do these alternative farmers simply abandon fields
because they are too weedy? How much pesticide use is there on
these farms? The report hints at these questions but doesn't
provide any real quantified answers,'' he said.
   Also, Gianessi said, the case studies were for the 1986 crop
year _ and the report came out in 1989.
   ``The farms are referred to as if they are currently sustaining
their successes for 1986,'' he said.
   ``One of these farms has gone out of business. At least two
others have had to abandon key parts of their successful program
because of the emergence of a new pest in Florida and the
withdrawal of a key pesticide in California.''

   Communist leaders and opposition
activists met Friday for the first time and agreed to hold more
talks while thousands of people again rallied demanding political
reforms.
   Constantin Trenchev of the independent trade union Podkrepa told
reporters that Andrei Lukanov, the No. 2 man in the Communist
leadership, and Premier Georgi Atanassov met with a Podkrepa leader
and three members of the Club for Glasnost and Perestroka.
   Trenchev did not attend the meeting. He said it was agreed that
a round of talks would begin next week, with the agenda still to be
decided.
   Parliament took these actions Friday: It agreed to have a
parliamentary commission headed by Lukanov investigate corruption
under former party leader Todor Zhivkov. The commission includes
representatives of independent groups who are not members of
Parliament.
   A commission was estalished to examine possible environmental
damage because of two power projects.
   Eliminated clauses in the penal code dealing with crimes against
the state and granted amnesty to all those punished under those
sections. It could not be immediately determined how many people
were affected by the amnesty.
   Several thousand people, many holding candles, gathered near the
Alexander Nevski cathedral, chanting ``Freedom!'' and ``Resign,
Resign!'' as they did during Thursday's mass demonstration in front
of Parliament when they called on Communist Party chief Petar
Mladenov and house speaker Stanko Todorov to quit.
   Many of the people first went to a rally outside Parliament but
marched to the cathedral when the reform Union of Democratic Forces
appealed to them to go to the church to honor Soviet human rights
champion Andrei Sakharov who died Thursday.
   About 2,000 people later left the cathedral and walked a
half-mile to the state television headquarters where they booed and
demanded an apology for television coverage of Thursday's
demonstration. They said the report had represented them as
extremists.
   Filip Bokov, recently appointed to head the television and radio
system, was drowned out by jeers as he tried to address the crowd.
   He insisted the television commentator had not used the word
``extremists'' but also apologized and TV later showed portions of
Thursday's demonstration.
   Thursday's angry protests be tens of thousands of people
developed after Parliament postponed action on demands that Article
1 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Communist Party the
dominant role, be scrapped.
   On Friday, Parliament unanimously approved a statement saying
the clause would be removed at its next session in January.
   The statement said Parliament considered dropping the article
``an important step on the way to solidifying political pluralism
and the development of a democratic state of law.''
   Proposals to set up free elections, which are scheduled to be
held by May, and to redistribute state-owned land also be will te
considered at the January session.
   The independent representatives at Friday's meeting were Zheliu
Zhelev and Petko Simeonov of the Club for Glasnost and Perestroika
and Georgi Spassov of Podkrepa.

<TEXT>
   A French mercenary and 21 of
his men arrived in South Africa on Friday after French troops
landed in the Comoros Islands and peacefully ended the mercenaries'
rule.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha told reporters most of the
mercenaries, who were in uniform, would be put on flights to France
within 48 hours and the future of their leader, Bob Denard, was
being discussed by France and South Africa.
   ``The idea is to get them out of here as soon as possible,''
said Dries Venter of the Foreign Ministry. He said the mercenaries
had been carrying sidearms, which were confiscated.
   Earlier Friday, French troops landed at the airport in Moroni,
capital of the Indian Ocean islands, and took control of security.
The French Defense Ministry said in Paris the Comoros government
had requested the ``military assistance mission.''
   ``France has not intervened in the Comoros,'' Premier Michel
Rocard of France said in Lome, Togo. ``We have lent a hand to a
process of returning to a more normal situation toward democracy.''
   Denard and the other European mercenaries boarded a South
African military plane four hours after the French landing and left
for South Africa.
   They trained and led the 600-man Presidential Guard, and had
controlled the Comoros since President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane
was assassinated Nov. 26.
   Most Comorans believe Denard and his mercenaries, who first put
Abdallah in power in 1978, were responsible for his death. Denard
has said a bodyguard accidentally shot Abdallah.
   South Africa and France had been the two largest aid donors to
the Comoros, a former French colony. South Africa, which has
extensive economic interests in the nation, had financed the
presidential guard.
   South Africa and France had cut off assistance, however, and
were pressuring Denard and his men to leave. Negotiations had been
going on for the past several days.
   Denard told a news conferece in Moroni on Thursday that he was
willing to relinquish control of the Comoros if the safety of his
men was guaranteed and if they were given an unspecified payment.
It was unclear Friday if those demands were met.
   French President Francois Mitterrand and Defense Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement said earlier this week that the French
military would not intervene in the Comoros.
   A French military spokesman said Friday that his nation's troops
were dispatched under the French-Comoran defense cooperation
agreement and came from the French Indian Ocean island of Mayotte,
185 miles away.
   The news agency Agence France-Presse reported from Moroni that
50 French paratroopers in helicopters landed Friday morning and
were followed by two transport planes full of troops.
   AFP said that as the first aircraft landed at Hahaya Airport,
about 250 Presidential Guardsmen stood at attention at one end of
the runway. Denard also was present, dressed in civilian clothes.
   Five other mercenaries arrived in Paris on Friday after an
overnight flight from Moroni.
   One of them, identified only as Lt. Didier, told reporters that
Denard ``didn't want to be king'' of the Comoros.
   ``He became it in spite of himself,'' Didier said.

   The Bush administration dismissed on Friday as
a ``charade'' the promotion of Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
as head of government.
   As the United States has not recognized the Noriega-led
government since February 1988, the action by the People's Assembly
changes nothing, a State Department official said.
   American officials are under orders to have no dealings with the
Panamanian government on grounds that such actions would be
illegitimate.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, asked about the
action by Panama's People's Assembly, told reporters:
   ``This is a charade and nonsense. As far as we're concerned at
least, there is no government in Panama anyway.
   ``For Noriega to be named head of a non-existent government, at
least in the view of the United States government, is putting him
in charge of nothing,'' Eagleburger said.
   The U.S. view is that the term of the last constitutionally
elected national assembly in Panama expired on Aug. 31 and that the
body that promoted Noriega has no legal or popular standing, the
State Department official said.
   He added that the 510 members of the assembly, none of whom
opposed Noriega's appointment, all were selected on the basis of
their loyalty to him.
   Noriega has been wanted by U.S. authorities for almost two years
on drug trafficking charges.

   For the first time in its 143-year history,
the Smithsonian Institution is trying to attract corporate support
for its vast educational and research activities as a permanent
supplement to federal financing.
   The Smithsonian recently announced the creation of a Corporation
Associate Program, starting next year and intended to raise more
than $1 million annually through corporate contributions or
membership dues.
   The founding chairman of the new fund-raising venture will be
Roberto C. Goizueta, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Coca-Cola Co.
   Coca-Cola pledged the maximum $25,000 in membership dues under
the new corporate program, which allows companies to co-sponsor a
major special event at the Smithsonian. Corporations choosing to
pay annual dues of $10,000 will be entitled to VIP treatment at
Smithsonian events.
   In the past, corporate support of the Smithsonian has been
confined mostly to underwriting specific museum exhibits or
projects. The new program is intended to generate unrestricted
funds for the whole range of Smithsonian activities, including its
14 museums and art galleries, the National Zoo and various other
educational and research facilities.
   Smithsonian officials said the institution's current
congressional appropriation of $266.7 million is insufficiet to
finance several ambitious new initiatives.
   These include attracting more Hispanics, blacks and other
minorities, developing exhibits focusing on cultural diversity,
environmental and conservation projects; and celebrating the 500th
anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America.
   Federal funds, including $30 million in government grants and
contracts, account for 83 percent of the Smithsonian's current
budget of $358.4 million.
   Net income from non-government Smithsonian trust funds, which
include endowments and donations from individuals, foundations and
corporations, is expected to total $61.7 million.
   The estimate of corporate donations in the current fiscal year,
which began Oct. 1, was unavailable, but the combined total of
unrestricted corporate and foundation gifts last year _ not
earmarked for any specific use _ was only $1.6 million.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Patricio Aylwin said
Friday he will exert his authority over the millitary and Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, who intends to retain command of the army when he
leaves the presidency March 11.
   Aylwin said he would meet with the military service commanders,
who have ruled Chile since a coup in September 1973, to establish a
working relationship.
   Scattered disturbances broke out Friday in downtown Santiago.
   Groups of young leftists threw rocks at police, who responded
with water cannon and tear gas. Skirmishes scattered shoppers and
halted traffic several times on the principal boulevard, Alameda
Avenue.
   The protesters demanded immediate release of leftists imprisoned
on charges of political violence, including many accused of
guerrilla activity. Police reported at least 20 arrests.
   Aylwin soundly defeated two opponents in Thursday's election. At
a news conference, he pledged to ``exercise the full powers of the
president, and the armed forces must be subordinate and obedient to
the president.''
   Later Friday, Aylwin told hundreds of thousands of supporters at
a Santiago rally that the armed forces' political role ``must end
in March'' when he takes over. ``We want to see the armed dedicated
to their professional duties, disciplined, obedient, thus
recovering the respect of all their compatriots.''
   His comment went to the heart of one of the new civilian
government's most difficult and sensitive problems: the
considerable power that still will be held by the armed service
commanders, particularly Pinochet as head of the 60,000-man army.
   A special provision of the constitution Pinochet's government
wrote in 1980 says the commanders cannot be dismissed until 1998.
   Aylwin, 71, won 55.2 of the 7 million votes cast Thursday, as
the candidate of a 17-party alliance of the center and left. Hernan
Buchi, the pro-government candidate, got 29.4 percent and Francisco
Javier Errazuriz, a wealthy enterprenneur, 15.4 percent.
   Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, said in
Washington: ``We are enthused ... that (the elections) were free
and fair. We are very, very pleased that Chile has returned to
democracy.''
   In Brussels, the European Community hailed Aylwin's victory as
``the return of a great and friendly country ... to the path of
freedom.''
   At his news conference, Aylwin said: ``Chile is effectively
moving back to democracy. There will be no puppet democracy, and
there will be no extra-democratic control over my government.''
   He said he would talk with military leaders ``as soon as
circumstances permit.''
   Under the new government, the military will have a majority on a
National Security Council empowered to ``represent'' its views to
the government. In addition, a bill now being discussed by
Pinochet's junta would give the armed forces substantial autonomy
under the civilian leadership.
   Aylwin expressed confidence that ``a reasonable formula'' could
be found, but declared: ``Nothing will prevent me from fully
exercising the presidential powers.''
   One of the most delicate issues in future military-civilian
relations is expected to be how Aylwin handles the investigation of
human rights abuses under the Pinochet regime.
   ``We don't have a wish of revenge, but of truth and justice,''
he said Friday. He also said anyone who committed abuses may be
brought to justice, including Pinochet.
   The 74-year-old general says he will not accept human rights
trials of military men, and has issued a clear warning: ``If one of
my men is touched, the state of law will be broken.''
   After overthrowing President Salvador Allende, an elected
Marxist who died during the coup, the military embarked on severe
repression of leftists who had supported him. Thousands were
arrested, many tortured or killed and others forced into exile.
   In his campaign, Aylwin emphasized plans to lead a government of
national unity that would attempt to overcome bitter social and
political divisions created by the coup and military rule.
   He indicated Friday that he would seek support from conservative
groups to repeal or make democratic changes in laws enacted by the
junta. Aylwin was careful to declare, however, that he would govern
with the 17 parties of the alliance he led to victory.
   His alliance will have a 72-48 majority in the 120-seat House of
Deputies. It won 22 of the 38 elected Senate seats, but Pinochet's
constitution gives his government the right to appoint up to 10
more senators.
   Complex election laws written by the junta caused many leftist
candidates to lose their races despite getting more votes than
rightist opponents.
   Aides to Pinochet said the laws were designed to ensure a
healthy minority presence in Congress. Opponents said the purpose
was to prevent changes in the constitution, which require a
two-thirds vote in both houses.

<HEAD>FDA Downgrading Rating of Products by Four Generic Companies</HEAD>

   The Food and Drug Administration is
downgrading the therapeutic rating of products made by four generic
drug companies because they submitted false or incorrect
information in their applications for FDA approval, the agency said
Friday.
   Many of the products already have been recalled by the
companies, or their distribution has been suspended.
   The lower rating tells physicians and pharmacists that the FDA
does not consider the drugs to be interchangable with the
brand-name drug.
   One of the companies, Quantum Pharmics of Amityville, N.Y., has
agreed to give up FDA approvals for nearly all its drugs, said
Carole Emerling, a spokeswoman for Quantum's parent company,
American Home Products.
   Quantum had stopped production on the 25 products in September.
The company has one drug left on the market, but Emerling said no
decision had been made on whether the other products will be
reintroduced.
   The FDA said it had downgraded the ratings of 29 products made
by Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., and that
the company has agreed to voluntarily relinquish approvals for the
products.
   The FDA has said it was initiating procedures to withdraw the
approvals.
   However, Vitarine president Roger Jordan said the company had
not agreed to give up the approvals. He said distribution of the
products was suspended in April and the company has resubmitted
data to the FDA in supplements to the drug approvals.
   The FDA also lowered the rating for a generic form of Dyazide, a
popular high blood pressure drug made by Bolar Pharmaceutical Co.
of Copiague, N.Y. The agency has said it wants to withdraw Bolar's
approval for that drug, which would leave no generic version of
Dyazide on the market.
   The FDA also said it has downgraded the ratings of three tablet
strengths of diazepam made by Superpharm Corp. of Bayshore, N.Y.
The company voluntarily recalled the products Dec. 7.
   The FDA is lowering the rating for orphengesic tablets,
orphengesic forte tablets and triamterene-hydrocholorothiazide
tablets made by Par Pharmaceuticals of Spring Valley, N.Y.
   The agency is moving to withdraw Superpharm's and Par's
approvals for those drugs.

<HEAD>Jet Makes Emergency Landing; Ash Suspected in Engine Trouble</HEAD>

   A Boeing 747 passenger jet made a safe
emergency landing here Friday after it flew through volcanic ash
and temporarily lost power to all four engines, the Federal
Aviation Administration said. There were no reports of injuries.
   The engine problems were reported immediately after KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines Flight 867 passed through ash from Redoubt Volcano,
which erupted Thursday and Friday. The volcano is 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   The jet carrying 231 passengers and a crew of 14 landed at
Anchorage International Airport at 12:25 p.m. and taxied to a gate
under its own power, airport and FAA officials said.
   The plane was traveling to Anchorage from Amsterdam when the
crew reported smoke in the cockpit and loss of engine power at
11:50 a.m., FAA spokeswoman Mary Lou Wojtalik said. About eight
minutes later, the crew reported two of the engines had been
restarted, Wojtalik said. She said the other two were restarted
shortly afterward.
   The jet fell 13,000 feet during the engine trouble, Wojtalik
said.
   She said the volcanic ash was so fine that it went undetected by
radar, and the pilot was unaware of the ash until it appeared on
the plane's windshield.
   Flight restrictions had been imposed because of the volcanic
ash. Wojtalik said the KLM plane was flying where it was supposed
to be when the engine problems occurred.

<HEAD>Ex-Ambassador to Vietnam Dies at 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick E. Nolting Jr., a career
diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, has died. He
was 78.
   Nolting died of an aneurysm Thursday at the University of
Virginia Hospital, a family member said.
   Nolting joined the U.S. Department of State in 1946 and then
entered the foreign service. Before being sent to Saigon, he was a
political officer at the U.S. Embassy in Paris, deputy U.S.
representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
alternate U.S. representative to the Atlantic Council.
   President Kennedy named him ambassador to South Vietnam in April
1961. He served in Saigon until he was replaced by Henry Cabot
Lodge in August 1963.
   Three months after Nolting left the country, South Vietnamese
President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother were assassinated in an
American-backed coup. Nolting was an ardent defender of Diem and
called U.S. involvement in the overthrow ``stupid'' and
``dishonorable.''
   Nolting retired from the foreign service in 1964 as a career
minister and returned with his family to Paris as vice president of
the international division of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
   In 1971, Nolting became a diplomat in residence at the
University of Virginia and then Olsson Professor of business
administration in the Colgate W. Darden Graduate School of Business
Administration.
   When the White Burkett Miller Center for Public Affairs opened
at the University of Virginia in 1975, he was named first director.
He became professor emeritus in 1982.
   Nolting is survived by his wife, Lindsay Crumpler Nolting, four
daughters and seven grandchildren.

   Francois Mitterrand invited George
Bush to lunch Saturday on this sun-splashed French island in the
Caribbean, and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist
dollars from the publicity.
   ``This is a historic situation for St. Martin,'' said Albert
Fleming, mayor of Marigot, the capital. ``We have never had two
presidents together.''
   Bush and Mitterrand will hold a two-hour meeting and working
lunch at an exclusive sun resort on St. Martin, 140 miles east of
Puerto Rico.
   U.S. and French officials have announced no agenda for the
talks, but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest
developments in Eastern Europe, including the reopening of borders
between East Germany and West Germany. The French president has
cautioned against a push for a reunified Germany, saying it could
upset the European balance of power.
   Mitterrand's invitation to Bush was in return for a visit the
French leader made in May to Bush's home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   On arrival at Princess Juliana International Airport on St.
Maarten, the Dutch half of the island, Bush and Mitterrand are to
be flown separately by helicopter to L'Habitation de Longvilliers,
a 253-room luxury hotel and marina at Marcel Cove on the
northeastern coast of St. Martin.
   A helicopter and scores of French presidential gendarmes and
army troops patrolled the 150-acre resort grounds Friday, checking
incoming cars with a metal detector. U.S. security officers also
were making rounds.
   Friday afternoon, French security officers exploded a box found
under a marina of the resort complex where Mitterrand and Bush will
confer. Col. Jean-Claude Gillot said it was determined later that
the box, found by divers during a routine surveillance, had been
empty.
   About 100 people were briefly evacuated from the Privilege Hotel
nearby.
   At the meeting site, workers set up a beachside tent for the
leaders and hooked up communication cables.
   Bush and Mitterrand won't be mixing with residents, Fleming
said, which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and
bunting in the capital. A few tourist shops, however, were selling
Bush-Mitterrand T-shirts.
   ``Tere's a little painting up, a little taping up, but basically
that's for Christmas,'' Fleming said.
   Similarly, on Dutch St. Maarten, there was little evidence of
the event, although Roger Snow, publisher of The Chronicle
newspaper, said: ``Everybody is talking about it, of course.''
   The island Bush and Mitterrand are visiting is a curious mix of
French, Dutch and Carribbean cultures.
   St. Martin, with its sidewalk cafes, fashionable boutiques and
strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks, has been called
a speck of France in the Caribbean. Technically, it is a
sub-prefecture of the French overseas department of Guadeloupe,
which has a status akin to a U.S. state.
   St. Maarten is part of the autonomous five-island Netherland
Antilles. Dutch is the official language, but few people speak it.
Nearly everybody speaks English instead, although the Papiamento
language is also heard.
   The French side is 21 square miles and the Dutch side 16 square
miles. Population estimates vary widely, but the 1990 Caribbean
Island Handbook says there are at least 8,000 in St. Martin and
14,000 in St. Maarten.
   The French have some topless and all-nude beaches; the Dutch,
casino gambling. With duty-free shopping and 36 sandy white beaches
ringing the island, both sides have been experiencing a tourism
boom in recent years, with a corresponding rise in crime and
concerns about overdevelopment.
   Nevertheless, Fleming said he thought the island was bound to
benefit from having hundreds of foreign newspaper reporters and TV
crews covering the one-day summit.
   ``That exposure throughout the world is very important to
tourism'' the mayor said. ``And we cater to the tourist. We don't
have any other income but the tourist trade.''
   Fleming said 600,000 tourists a year visit the French side of
the island alone, spending $90 million, not counting cruise ship
passengers. Americans account for most of the tourist trade.

   The high court on Friday threw
out convictions imposed in the country's longest treason trial and
freed five black activists, including three prominent
anti-apartheid leaders jailed since 1985.
   Scores of jubilant supporters, including Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, welcomed the men as they passed through Cape Town's
airport en route from Robben Island prison to their homes near
Johannesburg.
   ``It's a sign we are winning the struggle,'' said Tutu. ``We
knew that justice would prevail one day.''
   The three leaders of the United Democratic Front and one of
their co-defendants, a church worker, were convicted of treason in
November 1988 after a three-year trial. They received sentences
ranging from six to 12 years from a judge who contended the front
sought to incite anti-government violence.
   The Appeal Court in Bloemfontein overturned the verdicts against
those four and seven co-defendants convicted of terrorism. Six of
the seven received suspended sentences, but one, Muzi Malindi, was
given a five-year term and sent to the Robben Island penitentiary.
Malindi was a member of the Vaal Civic Association, an affiliate of
the United Democratic Front.
   Hundreds of chanting well-wishers greeted the five at
Johannesburg's airport. Police used guard dogs to control the
crowd, confiscated banners, and seized film from at least two news
photographers.
   The independent South African Press Association reported that a
woman in the welcoming crowd was bitten by a police dog and that
the Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid leader, was arrested when
he tried to aid her. Police had no immediate comment.
   A five-judge appellate panel unanimously upheld defense lawyers'
arguments that the trial judge, Kees van Dijkhorst, improperly
dismissed one of the two legal experts assisting him in the trial.
   Van Dijkhorst asserted that law professor W.A. Joubert was too
sympathetic to the United Democratic Front because he had signed a
front-supported petition opposing a new constitution that
entrenched racially segregated politics.
   During the trial, most of the defendants were granted bail. But
van Dijkhorst repeatedly denied bail for the three leaders of the
front, a huge multiracial coalition formed in 1983 to campaign for
black political rights.
   ``We have not sacrificed more than so many others. We do not
feel bitter,'' said Patrick Lekota, one of the front leaders, after
being carried shoulder-high through the Cape Town airport. ``For
us, it does not stop here. It's the beginning of another chapter.''
   Van Dijkhorst ruled that the front was a ``revolutionary
organization'' that conspired with the African National Congress
guerrilla movement to provoke violence in black townships in 1984
in a bid to render South Africa ungovernable. The front was banned
in February 1988, but most of its leaders have circumvented or
defied the ban.
   Lekota, 41, the front's publicity secretary, was sentenced to 12
years in prison; Pope Molefe, 37, the front's national secretary,
and Moses Chikane, 41, secretary of the Transvaal Province branch,
were sentenced to 10 years. The Rev. Tom Manthata, 49, a church
field for the South African Council of Churches, was sentenced to
six years.
   ``We always believed in their innocence,'' said the Rev. Frank
Chikane, general secretary of the church council. ``Their
conviction and sentencing were examples of the grave miscarriage of
justice which the apartheid courts of South Africa hand down.''
   Lawyers for Human Rights, an association of civil rights
lawyers, hailed the Appeal Court ruling as ``an excellent victory''
that would help restore the credibility of the South African
judiciary.
   The group urged the government to disclose the cost of ``this
abortive prosecution which took years of blundering incompetence to
achieve nothing but red faces.''
   The trial began in 1985 in the farming town of Delams and was
shifted to Pretoria. Eleven of the original 22 defendants were
acquitted at various stages.
   One of the activists' lawyers, David Dyson, said the Appeal
Court ruling appeared to be based solely on legal questions and
doubted it was related to the changing political climate created by
President F.W. de Klerk's easing of curbs on opposition activity.
   The trial entailed 439 days of court proceedings spread over
more than three years. The 368-page indictment named more than 900
alleged co-conspirators, ranging from Tutu to African National
Congress leader Oliver Tambo. There were more than 220 witnesses
and the official court record contained about 30,000 pages.

   Investigators have found no evidence of
jury tampering in the murder trial 26 years ago of a fertilizer
salesman charged in the slaying of civil rights activist Medgar
Evers.
   Charges against Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist who at
the time was a salesman in Greenwood, were dropped after two
all-white Hinds Circuit Court juries were unable to reach verdicts.
Allegations of possible jury tampering by a state agency recently
were raised.
   ``So far, there is absolutely no evidence to indicate jury
tampering,'' Assistant District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter said
Thursday. ``None were contacted. None were even aware that any
contact had been made with their employers until after the fact.''
   DeLaughter, who led the jury-tampering investigation into the
second, April 1964 trial, said he told a Hinds County grand jury
his findings Thursday in a closed-door meeting at the courthouse.
   Prosecutors now will turn their attention to Beckwith's first
trial earlier in 1964, although no allegations of jury tampering
have been raised about that trial.
   Evers, field director of the state NAACP, was shot to death June
12, 1963, outside his home in northwest Jackson.
   Beckwith's rifle, bearing one of his fingerprints, was found
near the Evers home. Beckwith contended the rifle had been stolen
from him.
   DeLaughter said Thursday that prosecutors are still trying to
decide if the murder case itself can be reopened and new charges
sought.
   ``My opinion is unless we can have the benefit of the evidence
available in 1964 and newly discovered evidence, it would be
extremely hard to get around the speedy trial question,''
DeLaughter said.
   Beckwith, 68, now lives in Signal Mountain, Tenn.
   The district attorney's office investigated Beckwith's April
1964 trial after a Jackson newspaper reported Oct. 1 that the state
Sovereignty Commission, the state's segregation spy agency,
screened potential jurors.
   ``What was done was the (Sovereignty Commission) investigator
would call up employers and say, `What can you tell me about this
person?''' DeLaughter said.
   ``While I consider it extremely unethical for one state agency
to be working against state prosecutors, it still is not a crime,''
DeLaughter said.
   The commission, formed by the 1956 Legislature, died after its
funding was cut off in 1973.
   DeLaughter said he and others in the district attorney's office
contacted 11 of the 12 jurors in the second Beckwith trial and are
seeking the other juror.
   DeLaughter said he and investigators talked earlier with former
Sovereignty Commission Director Erle Johnston of Forest and
reviewed records Johnston kept. The commission's own records are
sealed in a vault on orders of the 1977 Legislature.
   The rifle and all other evidence from the two trials are missing
from the Hinds County circuit clerk's office.
   But DeLaughter said there's no indication the evidence was
stolen. If cases are inactive for many years, the law allows the
evidence to be destroyed.

   The Communist Party published a
draft declaration Friday that it was ready to give up guaranteed
power and compete with other parties in elections next year.
   It also called for a new constitution guaranteeing
market-oriented economic reform, respect for human rights and an
independent judiciary.
   ``The Communist Party of Yugoslavia supports freedom of assembly
and speech, and all other civil liberties regardless of political
convictions of individuals,'' said the document, written by a
committee preparing for a party congress next month.
   The party will relinquish its monopoly on power and take part in
``free, direct and secret (ballot) elections,'' the document said,
and ``we are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow it
will not be too late for socialism in Yugoslavia.''
   Reforms specified in the declaration should be carried out
within six months after the congress, it said, as published by the
daily Borba.
   Some opponents of change fear independent parties would be
formed along ethnic lines and further exacerbate tensions in this
tenuous federation of six republics and two autonomous republics.
   Communist leaders in Serbia, the largest of republic, has
resolutely opposed Western-style democracy, but appeared to soften
the stance Friday at a regional congress.
   Bogdan Trifunovic, Serbian party chief, said in a keynote
address that Communists and Serbian authorities ``have no reason or
wish to administratively impede the establishment'' of other
political parties.
   Croatia, the second-largest republic, the liberal Slovenia in
the north already have endorsed democratic reform. Both have
scheduled free legeslative elections for spring.
   Numerous independent political movements and parties have been
formed in Croatia and Slovenia during the past year.
   Despite official opposition, several independent groups also
have been formed in Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro, where
Communists have in tried to avoid reform in the past.
   The Serbian leadership has argued that one-party rule was needed
to control centuries-old ethnic conflicts that have boiled up since
the death in 1980 of President Tito, who founded Communist
Yugoslavia.
   Much of the recent unrest has centered on the province of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of more than 90
percent. Serbia is the largest republic, and both of the nation's
provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina, are part of it but not fully
subject to its control.
   Kosovo, which borders Albania, was a part of ancient Serbia.
Most of the Christian Serbs in the province view the Moslem
Albanians as intruders and accuse Albanians of harassing them.
   The draft declaration by the national Communist Party said
Yugoslavia will seek ``full participation in integration processes
in Europe, and membership in the European Community, the Council of
Europe, the European Free Trade Association and other similar
organizations and institutions.''

   The Soviet Union announced Friday that it
has 627,500 troops abroad, its first such disclosure of its foreign
forces, and said it would like to bring them home by the year 2000.
   However, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky, who
made the announcement, said the pullouts would not be unilateral
and would depend on negotiations with other nations.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the statement
was ``encouraging.'' He said the U.S. position is that all such
matters are to be worked out at the conventional forces talks under
way in Vienna.
   Petrovsky did not give a breakdown of troop deployment and said
it was well known that the troops were stationed in Warsaw Pact
countries and in Mongolia. He did not elaborate.
   Next week, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is to
meet leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Diplomats
said they believed the troop strength announcement was intended to
help pave the way for that visit.
   Under a U.N.-negotiated agreement, the Soviet Union withdrew
more than 100,000 troops from Afghanistan and has said that all
nations should agree not to station their soldiers abroad.
   Petrovsky declined to discuss possible troops withdrawals from
Eastern Europe, saying those were subject to negotiations in Vienna.
   A year ago, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced his
nation would make massive, unilateral cuts in soldiers and military
equipment overseas.
   Petrovsky said that next year it is possible to conclude a
practical agreement on withdrawal of conventional forces in Europe.
``But in order to achieve the aim of withdrawing troops to national
boundaries, it is necessary to use different bilateral and
multilateral arrangements and talks,'' he said.

   Nearly one year after the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103, investigators said Friday they have assembled
some clues to the international terrorist plot but are not close to
prosecuting anyone.
   ``What we are doing in effect is trying to piece together an
international terrorist jigsaw,'' said George Esson, a police
official. ``We have some of the pieces, some we are trying to
place, and some we have yet to find.''
   Esson spoke as Scottish officials announced the first public
inquiry to be held into the explosion of Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, that killed all 259 people on board and
11 people on the ground.
   The inquiry, to be held next year before an independent judge,
will be the first in which members of the public will have the
chance to attend the proceedings. A criminal police investigation
and a Transport Department investigation alreday are under way in
Britain.
   Speaking at a news conference, officials said one focus of the
investigation is the Popular Front For the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a radical Palestinian faction headed by
Ahmed Jibril.
   But they said other groups also were under investigation.
   ``It would be right to say that we have focused our attention on
one group but it would be unwise for us to exclude others,'' Esson
said.
   Asked whether that one group was the PFLP-GC, he said,
``certainly.''
   Jibril, a former Syrian army officer, has denied involvement
though he has said his faction has used devices like the one that
brought down Flight 103.
   Lord Fraser, Scotland's senior law officer, and Esson, chief
constable of the Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, told reporters
they also are interested in Mohammad Abu Talb, a member of another
radical Palestinian group who is charged in Sweden with four
bombings in northern Europe.
   Also Friday in Washington, attorneys for families of 13 members
of the flight crew filed a lawsuit alleging that two companies
failed to provide adequate security. The lawsuit says Alert
Management Systems Inc. and Pan Am World Services Inc., which
provided security at Frankfurt and Heathrow airports, failed to
comply with minimum security procedures.
   In New York, Pan Am spokesman Alan Loflin said the airline
hadn't heard of the lawsuit.
   Esson said the police investigation has encompassed 52 countries
and Fraser said West Germany, Malta and Sweden have been ``the
focus of important areas of investigation.''
   Investigators have said the bomb was made of a plastic explosive
packed in a radio-cassette player in a suitcase loaded into a
forward cargo hold of the Boeing 747.
   They released photos Friday showing the reconstruction of the
forward hold, with a gaping hole, and the reconstructed metal
container which held the suitcase bomb.
   Fraser said significant progress had been made in identifying
other contents of the suitcase, including clothing.
   He said he ordered the Scottish public inquiry now because the
police investigation had reached a stage where he thought it would
be ``appropriate.'' He did not elaborate, but said the inquiry
could be postponed or canceled if criminal proceedings appeared
likely.
   The public inquiry, formally known as a fatal accident inquiry,
will be held next year although a date and a presiding judge have
not yet been selected, Fraser said.
   He confirmed he had requested Swedish permission for Scottish
police to remove clothing from Abu Talb's Swedish home, reportedly
to compare it with the recovered shreds.
   ``I have at present no intention to seek the extradition of Abu
Talb,'' Fraser said.
   Esson would not say how many individuals were under
investigation nor whether all were Arabs. Some are in a position
where they could be extradited, he said.
   Scottish police still believe the bomb ``either started or
passed through Frankfurt airport'' where the flight originated, he
said. West German police maintain that has not been proven.
   Unconfirmed news reports have said the suitcase arrived in
Frankfurt on an Air Malta flight from the Mediterranean island and
was transferred onto the Pan Am flight without an accompanying
passenger.
   Esson said he believed police will obtain enough evidence to
prosecute the bombers, but said ``there are more investigations to
be conducted.''
   The photographs released Friday were of sections of the plane,
painstakingly reconstructed from wreckage scattered over 845 square
miles to determine precisely how it was destroyed.
   The reconstruction was done by the Department of Transport's Air
Accidents Investigation Branch based at Farnborough, southwest of
London, which will publish a report on its findings in the first
half of 1990.
   One photograph shows the fuselage, including the forward cargo
hold area where the suitcase bomb exploded. The section 55 feet
long, 27 feet high and 25 feet wide shows a gaping hole. The metal
is peeled back, illustrating what investigators called the
``petaled out'' effect produced by the explosion.
   Another photo shows the reconstructed metal cargo container,
with the Pan Am insignia on the side, in which the suitcase had
been loaded onto the plane.

   The ``Iron Curtain'' of barbed
wire and other barricades along Czechoslovakia's border with West
Germany also should be dismantled, Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek
said Friday.
   Czechoslovakia started removing parts of its barriers along the
Austrian border on Monday but left untouched the fenches and
obstacles on the frontier with West Germany.
   Vacek told a news conference the ``army leadership ... proposes
the Czechoslovak government evaluate the possibility of eliminating
engineering and technical obstacles along the entire Austrian and
West German border.''
   He announced that Communist Party cells within the armed forces
would be disbanded next month and said there were plans to shorten
the term of compulsory military service from 24 months to 18 months.
   ``The Czechoslovak army is going to be built on principles of
openness and democracy for all citizens, but without political
parties,'' Vacek said in reporting the planned elimination of
Communist party cells in the military, ending more than four
decades of political activity including indoctrination.
   It was recently announced that party cells in the police force
would be eliminated.
   Vacek, a member of the Communist Party, was sworn in Dec. 10 as
a minister in Czechoslovakia's first government not dominated by
Communists since 1948.

   An arson fire Friday at a high-rise
apartment complex for the elderly killed three people out of reach
of fire ladders, and safety violations at the building hampered
rescue efforts, authorities said.
   Residents of the 15-story Midtown Towers were evacuated in
sub-zero temperatures after the early morning blaze broke out on
the first floor and pumped smoke into upper floors.
   Authorities said 77 residents and two firefighters were
hospitalized, most for treatment of smoke inhalation. Six residents
were listed in critical condition and 19 were in guarded condition
Friday afternoon. Twenty-six residents were listed as stable.
   ``A lot of people were hanging out the upstairs windows
screaming,'' said Bruce Wright of Guilfoyle Ambulance Service Inc.
``There was a tremendous amount of flames coming out the front and
back end of the building.''
   As the acrid smoke filled the building, notes for help fluttered
from windows to rescuers below.
   ``It was terrible, terrible,'' said wheelchair-bound resident
Edna Gardner.
   State fire investigators called the fire ``probable arson,''
Police Chief Michael Hennegan said. If this preliminary
determination stands, the deaths will be investigated as homicides,
he said.
   A door at the base of the building's stairwell jammed, trapping
some residents until it was pried open. Most of the dead and
injured were found in stairwells, said Fire Chief Joseph Gravelle.
   Police Sgt. Ray Montrois identified the dead as Pansy Kiernan,
88, Eunice Roberts, 88, and Frank Pepe, 69, all residents.
   Fires in other parts of the state claimed the lives of a
74-year-old Buffalo man and a 2-year-old girl in a trailer-home
fire in Elbridge, just west of Syracuse.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District Attorney Harry Connick was indicted
by a federal grand jury Friday for allegedly aiding a New Orleans
bookie by returning seized gambling records.
   Eight others were also named in the indictment for running or
aiding the $2,000 a day sports gambling operation. They included
convicted bookmaker Walton K. Aucoin, 49, of New Orleans and former
assistant U.S. attorney Patrick Fanning, who is now Aucoin's
attorney.
   Also indicted were actor Paul Burke, 63; Wilson P. Abraham, 70,
a New Orleans real estate developer; William G. Condon, 34, no
address; Steven Bertolino, 57, no address; Iris Ethridge, 30, no
address; and Darleen Aucoin Toca, 27, no address.
   Condon, Bertolino, Aucoin, Ms. Ethridge and Ms. Toca were
charged with owning and conducting an illegal gambling operation.
Fanning, Abraham and Burke were accused of aiding the operation by
helping Connick devise the excuse for returning the records to
Aucoin.
   The excuse was that Aucoin needed the records to pay his federal
taxes, specifically, to file his December federal gambling stamp
tax returns.
   U.S. Attorney John Volz said that since the indictment included
Fanning, who worked with him in the federal prosecutor's office in
New Orleans, the case was being handled by the Justice Department's
Public Integrity division from Washington.
   Burke, a New Orleans native who was in the movie ``Valley of the
Dolls,'' and Ms. Ethridge also were charged with perjury for
allegedly lying to the grand jury investigating the case.
   Connick, district attorney in New Orleans since 1974, denied any
wrongdoing. At a news conference attended by about 150 of his staff
members and supporters, he accused Volz of carrying out a personal
vendetta, complete with ``Brown Shirt'' tactics.
   ``The U.S. attorney's office is using the Justice Department in
Washington, D.C., to do his dirty work for him,'' Connick said.
   Connick said he would not resign and would run for re-election
to a fourth term next year, even if the case is still pending. He
said he did not expect the indictment to affect his handling of his
office.
   ``I'm not going to roll over and play dead for John Volz or
anybody else,'' Connick said, sparking enthusiastic applause from
the crowd of supporters.
   When the grand jury investigation surfaced in January, Connick
said the probe centered on the way the bookmaker, Aucoin, got
copies of the betting sheets seized in a Dec. 4, 1988, raid on his
apartment.
   At the time Connick said he received telephone calls on behalf
of Aucoin from Fanning, Abraham and Burke, and he acknowledged that
he got copies of the gambling records for Aucoin.
   ``There is nothing unusual, nothing illegal, about a prosecutor
returning to the accused his property or copies of his property,''
Connick told the news conference.
   He denied having been advised by his staff or police that
returning the property would help a gambling operation.
   ``Despite being advised by the New Orleans police and his own
staff that defendant Aucoin needed the bookmaking records solely to
pay and collect the illegal bookmaking debts and to continue the
illegal gambling business without disruption, defendant Connick,
without examining records and before the case had been referred to
or accepted by his office for prosecution, ordered the return of
copies of the bookmaking records to defendant Aucoin, who he had
been informed was one of the largest bookmakers in Louisiana,'' the
indictment said.
   Connick also told Fanning he would attempt to get Aucoin's
Jaguar returned to the bookmaker, despite being advised by police
that Aucoin used the car in paying and collecting gambling debts,
the indictment said.
   All the defendants face a maximum 25 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine if convicted. The perjury counts could net Burke and
Ms. Ethridge an extra five years and $250,000 fines each.
   Volz has denied any personal grudge. He refused to elaborate on
the indictment at a Friday news conference.
   Aucoin was released the same day of his 1988 arrest without
having to post bond. He was described by police as a three-time
convicted bookmaker who catered to high rollers.
   Connick acknowledged that the day after the arrest he asked
police for copies of gambling records, at Fanning's request.
   Connick contended he acted in accordance with state criminal
procedures, which he said allow defendants to see evidence against
them so their attorneys can prepare a defense.
   Aucoin had not been charged at the time. Connick did not
formally charge him until after the U.S. attorney wrote in a Jan.
24 letter that the grand jury had made Connick a target in their
investigation.
   Frank DiSalvo, attorney for Fanning, said Friday his client has
done nothing wrong. Abraham did not immediately return a telephone
call to his home. There are no telephone listings for the other
defendants in the New Orleans directory.

<HEAD>Actor Jock Mahoney Dies at 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jock Mahoney, perhaps Hollywood's most
famous stuntman-turned-actor famed for his television roles as
Tarzan, Yancy Derringer and the Range Rider, has died of an
apparent stroke. He was 70.
   Mahoney, a resident of Poulsbo, died Thursday at Harrison
Memorial Hospital where he was taken after an automobile accident
two days earlier.
   An autopsy will be done to verify the cause of death, a routine
procedure for deaths from car accidents, said Kitsap County's chief
deputy coroner, Jane Jermy.
   Mahoney, born Jacques Mahoney in Chicago, was a tall, rugged
youth who began his film career in 1945 after serving as a fighter
pilot in World War II.
   He did stunt work for Errol Flynn, Gregory Peck, Gene Autry and
others. Autry signed him to a contract and cast him in ``The Range
Rider,'' an action-packed television series in the 1950s.
   Mahoney socked and tumbled his way through appearances on ``The
Loretta Young Show,'' ``Rawhide,'' ``Yancy Derringer,'' ``Laramie''
and other programs until his career began to fade in the 1960s.
   He appeared in several ``Tarzan'' movies during that decade, one
of which led to a major bout with illness. While filming in India,
Mahoney came down with dengue fever, dysentery and pneumonia.
   ``I refused to take my own advice: Know your limitations and
fight the urge to do the stunt just one more time,'' he later said.
   After more than two years of recovery, Mahoney's star began to
rise again in the late 1960s when he appeared on numerous
television shows, including several ``Tarzan'' episodes.
   In 1973 he suffered a severe stroke on the set of ``Kung Fu''
and made only occasional appearances thereafter. He was seen in
several 1981 episodes of ``B.J. and the Bear.''
   He is survived by his wife, Autumn (Patricia) Mahoney.

<HEAD>Cabinet Shakeup Follows Economic Nosedive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem, under
attack for his handling of the nation's economic crisis, on Friday
accepted the resignation of his economy minister and shuffled two
other Cabinet posts.
   In another development, the Central Bank declared a bank holiday
Monday to let shaky financial markets settle. By Tuesday, banks and
exchange houses will have been closed for three of the past six
working days.
   Antonio Erman Gonzalez, an accountant and former provincial
treasury secretary, was named to replace Economy Minister Nestor
Rapanelli. Gonzalez served briefly in the Central Bank as a vice
president and has been in the Cabinet as minister of health since
Menem's May 14 election.
   Menem's former campaign manager, Julio Mera Figueroa, was
appointed interior minister to replace Eduardo Bauza, who was named
minister of health. Figueroa is a longtime strategist in Menem's
Peronist Party.
   ``I have resigned, and if you are looking for scandalous
statements, then you haven't gotten to know me very well in five
months,'' Rapanelli told reporters.
   Asked as he walked out of the Treasury Building after noon what
he intended to do in the future, Rapanelli replied, ``I'm going to
have lunch.''
   Menem canceled a news conference Friday evening. Presidential
spokesman Humberto Toledo told reporters no other Cabinet changes
would be made and the new ministers will be sworn in Monday.
   ``The government will continue along the same general lines,''
declared Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, a Harvard-educated
economist.
   The Cabinet shakeup followed a 6-week plunge of the austral on
foreign exchange markets, soaring interest rates, strikes by
teachers, doctors, court clerks and other public employees for
higher wages and rekindled inflation.
   Menem's tax reform and 1990 budget proposal have stalled in
Congress, and organized labor stepped up its criticism that two
stabilization plans imposed since he took office in July were aimed
at curtailing inflation by forcing workers to accept cuts in real
wages.
   Last week, Menem officially devalued the austral and raised
public service rates again. He angered businessmen by increasing
taxes on exports and suspending for two years the repayment of
principal on internal bonds.
   Labor leaders, politicians and businessmen were cautious in
their assessment of the political shakeup.
   ``It was unavoidable,'' said Guerino Andreoni, co-director of
the 3 million-member General Confederation of Labor.
   Osvaldo Cornide, director of the Argentine Chamber of Merchants,
said Rapanelli had concentrated on curtailing inflation to the
exclusion of other important goals, such as controlling interest
rates and wage levels.
   Gonzalez, a member of the small Christian Democrat Party, is the
third economy minister in Menem's government. The first, Miguel
Roig, died of a heart attack six days after he was sworn in.
   Gonzalez' appointment was expected to appeal to organized labor
and factions of the Peronist Party that disagree with Menem's plans
to reduce state expenditures, sell public companies, lower tariff
barriers and increase taxes.
   Aldo Ducler, a Rapanelli aide who also resigned, called the
departing economic team ``a dike against the demands of those who
resisted the modernization of the economy.''
   Rapanelli, 60, is a former executive of the Bunge and Born grain
trading multinational synonomous with ``big business'' in this
South American country. It is viewed with distaste by unions and
leftist elements within Menem's party.
   His resignation has been expected since the free market austral
plunged to 1,560 per dollar on Thursday from 1,020 the week before.
   Meanwhile, supermarkets and other stores began to mark up prices
drastically in anticipation of inflation projected to top 30
percent in December. The November rate was 6.5 percent; the October
rate, 5.6 percent.
   Mera Figueroa is a former national deputy with long ties to the
Peronists. During the 1970s, he was aligned with its leftist
factions and imprisoned for three years following a 1976 military
coup.
   After the restoration of democracy in 1983, Mera Figueroa worked
within the party and was an early backer of Menem, then a
provincial governor.

<TEXT>
   The raucous news conferences of the Ed Koch era
will have a touch more class under his more sedate successor, his
press secretary said. To begin with, call him ``Mr. Dinkins.'' But
first, raise your hand!
   That was the word Friday from Albert Scardino, the press
secretary for Mayor-elect David Dinkins, as he laid down some
``rules of conduct'' for the City Hall press corps.
   Scardino, a former New York Times reporter who won a Pulitzer
Prize for editorial writing, told reporters that Dinkins ``places a
high value on courtesy and mutual respect'' and would like to be
addressed as ``Mr. Dinkins'' at press conferences.
   Scardino said reporters also should raise their hands when they
want to ask questions and be recognized before doing so, rather
than blurt them out in competition with other journalists.
   ``I would be grateful to you if you would please respectfully
pose your questions, `Mr. Dinkins'. He'll respond to you,''
Scardino said at the third in a series of press briefings he has
set up during the transition of government from the Koch
administration.
   ``I would appreciate it if you would please try to restrain
yourself and not ask out of turn,'' he said.
   Asked if Dinkins had complained to him about the way the press
asked its questions, Scardino said, ``No. He has not.''
   Dinkins said later he did not mind how reporters addressed him.
He said he did not know Scardino was going to make such a request
and had not asked him to do so.
   However, he said, ``I do think it would be useful if reporters
were not discourteous to each other.''
   At Mayor Edward I. Koch's news conferences, reporters tend to
call him ``Mr. Mayor,'' ``Mayor'' or ``Your Honor.'' Koch seemed
amused by the whole thing when he learned about the request.
   ``I wonder what it would have been like if they called me Mr.
Ed, like a horse?'' Koch said.

<HEAD>Average Japanese Income Tops U.S.; Still Behind Switzerland</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Edits throughout to CLARIFY that figures are per capita calculations
of gross national product.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. national income, figured on the basis of
population, rose slightly in 1988 but was far outpaced by Japan,
the World Bank reported Friday.
   Per capita income in the United States last year was $19,780,
compared with $18,580 in 1987. In Japan, the income rose from
$15,840 to $21,040, the World Bank said. The bank gave all incomes
in U.S. dollars.
   The World Bank arrives at its figures by dividing the value of a
country's total production, the gross national product, by its
population. Per capita income thus includes people without income,
such as children, and non-wage income, such as returns on
invstments.
   The Swiss continued to rank first in per capita income with a
1988 average of $27,260, up from $21,310 in 1987.
   Mozambique ranked lowest among the 152 members of the World Bank
with a 1988 annual per capita income of $100.
   The United States, which in 1987 ranked second only to
Switzerland in per capita income, was fifth last year, behind
Switzerland, Japan, Iceland and Norway. The figure for Iceland was
$20,160, while in Norway it was $20,020.
   Much of the rise in the Japanese income can be attributed to an
increase in the value of the yen in comparison with the dollar, as
well as to increased Japanese production. Elsewhere, differences
could be linked to shifts in the value of the dollar compared with
other currencies. The dollar has been rising in 1989 after a fall
that began in 1985.
   One former World Bank economist, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, cautioned that the figures should not be taken to
reflect living standards.
   ``In Sweden, people have to spend 15 percent of their income
fighting the climate,'' he said. ``That's not the case in Italy.''
   Italy's per capita income was $13,320 for 1988, compared with
$10,430 the previous year. Sweden's was $19,150, up from $15,610.
   The bank gives no figure on per capita income for the Soviet
Union, which is not a member country. However, the CIA puts it at
$8,850, well behind $12,480 in East Germany and $10,140 in
Czechoslovakia.
   China and India rank low on the list with an average income of
less than a dollar a day _ $330 a year. The per capita in the
African countries of Benin was $340 a year and $360 a year in Kenya.
   China reported the fastest growth rate: 9 percent between 1986
and 1988, while Kenya's income grew by only 1.5 percent and Benin
declined 4.5 percent.
   That does not take in account such illegal production as drugs
and other goods made for the black market, or wages that are
unreported to avoid taxes. It has been estimated that this
``underground economy'' can account for as much as a third of some
countries' incomes.
   ``The World Bank Atlas 1989'' also reported on some
quality-of-life elements.
   Japan was at the top in life expectancy. A Japanese baby born in
1988 could expect to live to age 78, compared with 77 for a Swiss,
French or Swedish baby, 75 for a U.S. baby, 69 for a Soviet and 42
in such poor African countries as Guinea or Sierra Leone.
   Literacy varied widely. Somalia, Niger and North Yemen reported
in 1985 _ the latest figures available _ that only 12 percent to 14
percent of their people could read and write.
   Unesco reports that the literacy rate is 95 percent or higher in
America, the Soviet Union and the more prosperous countries of
Europe. China reported a 69 percent literacy rate.
   Many poor countries have reported big jumps in school enrollment
between 1970 and 1986: from 56 percent to 80 percent in China and
from 7 percent to 50 percent in North Yemen.

<TEXT>
   A commander of Yasser Arafat's PLO faction
insisted Friday that his forces had raided a Syrian army base in
south Lebanon, though PLO headquarters condemned the attack.
   Thursday's attack, which Lebanese police also blamed on Arafat's
mainstream Fatah group, threatened to undermine efforts to end a
six-year rift between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Police reported 15 people were killed and 43 wounded when
Palestinian guerrillas from Fatah, the biggest faction in the
Palestine Liberation Organization, attacked Syria's military
intelligence headquarters in south Lebanon at the village of Rmaile.
   ``The operation was carried out by Palestinians. No Lebanese
took part in the attack,'' said the Fatah commander, who identified
himself only by his nom-de-guerre of Abu-Maher.
   He said Fatah commanders in south Lebanon prepared the attack
without consulting Arafat.
   ``No one knew about it at PLO headquarters in Tunis,'' he said
in an interview in Sidon's Ein el-Hilweh refugee camp 25 miles
south of Beirut. It is the main PLO base in Lebanon.
   A statement issued Thursday by PLO headquarters in Tunis,
Tunisia, denounced the attack without explicitly denying that Fatah
members were involved.
   The statement said the PLO had ordered an investigation in
collaboration with the other factions in Sidon to identify the
``authors and commanders'' of the attack.
   As chief of the PLO umbrella group, Arafat presides over several
factions of guerrilla fighters who sometimes launch independent
attacks or war among themselves.
   Syrian officials in Damascus made no comment on Thursday's
fighting, which undermined efforts by Arafat and Assad to achieve
long-elusive Arab unity before convening an international Middle
East peace conference.
   About 150 of Abu-Maher's fighters reportedly stormed and
ransacked the Syrian base three miles north of Sidon to free
comrades held there.
   Police said the dead included four Syrians and five Palestinians.
   They said a Communist Party guerrilla, two leftists and three
members of the Nasserite militia that has ruled Sidon since
Lebanon's civil war broke out in April 1975 were also killed at a
checkpoint north of Sidon when they clashed with the returning
Fatah fighters.
   The guerrillas, led by Maj. Abdel-Raouf Zaarour, freed 15
prisoners held by the Syrians, including Lebanese and Fatah
members, in the two-hour clash at Rmaile.
   About 2,000 Palestinians are held in Syrian prisons. Most were
rounded up in 1983 during a Syrian-backed mutiny by radical groups
that drove Arafat's forces out of the north Lebanon port of Tripoli.
   ``We have the right to strike at the Syrians and defend our
rights. We're not under Syrian trusteeship,'' said Abu-Maher.
Syrian forces, who came to Lebanan under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate, police most of country.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo's drug treatment czar,
under fire for alleged shoddy management of his agency and helping
friends obtain lucrative state contracts, resigned Friday.
   The embattled bureaucrat, former heroin addict Julio Martinez,
was quickly given a new state job by Cuomo at a ``comparable''
salary.
   Martinez, 45, one of the Cuomo administration's highest ranking
Hispanics, received $87,338 as director of the state Division of
Substance Abuse Services. He will become head of the state prison
system's drug treatment programs, said Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryer.
   Only a few hours earlier, but before Martinez had a lengthy
meeting with several top Cuomo aides, a spokesman said Martinez had
no plans to quit.
   Martinez came under fire Thursday when the state Commission on
Government Integrity, after a year-long probe, outlined a string of
alleged abuses and called for an overhaul of the Martinez-led state
substance abuse division.
   In his resignation, Martinez said the commission's report failed
to present ``a complete and balanced view'' of his division's work,
but the charges ``have effectively precluded my ability to provide
strong and continuing leadership within the agency.''
   Cuomo, in a letter to Martinez, said the job he had held was
``undoubtedly one of the most difficult positions in public service
anywhere in the United States.''
   The Martinez-headed agency also had come under fire from the
state comptroller's office and Cuomo's own management advisers. The
division announced a restructuring after that earlier criticism.
   Fryer said Martinez got a new job ``because the governor has a
very high regard for Julio and always has. Julio's ability to
motivate and inspire people to seek and participate fully in
treatment is a great asset to the state.''
   Fryer also noted that in his new job, Martinez ``would not have
the administrative burden'' he had in the old job.
   Martinez, a native of Puerto Rico and a drug treatment activist
in New York City, was picked to head the state's drug treatment
efforts by then-Gov. Hugh Carey in 1979. Hispanic leaders recently
had pressed Cuomo to keep Martinez in that post despite the
critical reports about his agency.
   Traditionally, Cuomo doesn't fire cabinet members he's unhappy
with, they simply resign, as Martinez did.
   The governor, who is facing an expected re-election race next
year, has recently been trumpeting a major new state effort to
battle drug abuse.
   On Thursday, the Cuomo-appointed anti-corruption commission said
Martinez's agency suffered from an intricate web of favoritism and
infighting. The commission said friends of Martinez won
million-dollar, drug-treatment contracts that never led to any
treatment.
   Three of four residential drug treatment programs investigated
over the last year failed to open a single bed, despite millions of
dollars in state funding, said the commission, headed by Fordham
Law School Dean John Feerick.
   The Ferrick Commission said Martinez, over the objection of
other top division officials, frequently had intervened on behalf
of friends and long-time associates to arrange funding for their
proposed drug-treatment programs.
   ``The evidence concerning all four programs under investigation
indicates that a personal connection to Director Martinez or other
executive staff members smoothed the way for DSAS funding,'' the
commission said.
   The commission report didn't call for Martinez to be replaced.
Spokeswoman Linda Sachs said Friday that the commission has not yet
decided whether to recommend a criminal investigation.

<HEAD>Reports Soviet Military Cutbacks on Schedule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet military budget for next year is 8.2
percent lower than for 1989 and unilateral cutbacks have reduced
Soviet armed forces by 256,000 personnel, a senior army officer
said Friday.
   Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov told a news conference that under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program ``the image of the
armed forces is changing.''
   He said military staffs were going ahead with the plan to cut
troop strength by 500,000 by 1991.
   Plans for the cutbacks and reduced military spending were
announced by Gorbachev in a speech to the United Nations on Dec. 7,
1988.
   ``As of today, we have carried out 50 percent of our goal, we
have reduced our troops by 256,000 people,'' said Chervov, director
of the General Staff. He said there has been an additional
reduction of 173,000 military cadets.
   ``We have substantially reduced major military maneuvers and we
are reducing the plans for military materiel and weapons,'' he said.
   As of Jan. 1, 1990, Soviet troop strength will consist of
3,993,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen, compared to America's 2.2
million military personnel, according to Chervov.
   He did not specify where the cuts were made, but said the
reductions were not limited to Eastern Europe and applied to all
branches of the armed forces.
   Chervov said the 1990 military budget is 70.9 billion rubles
($114.8 billion), compared to 77.3 billion rubles for this year.
   Some of the money slashed from the military budget will be used
to convert military production plants into civilian operations to
produce more consumer goods, he said, but he gave no figures.
   Gorbachev's economic reforms include increasing consumer goods
to alleviate the country's chronic shortages.

   The holdup occurred Dec. 4 in a busy branch of Fidelity Bank in

hopes of obtaining information from the public to help solve the
crime.

<HEAD>Gacha _ from Pig Farmer to Cocaine Kingpin</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Colombia-Gacha</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the son of
Colombian peasants, was a pig farmer who became one of the richest
men in the world with profits from cocaine trafficking.
   He was believed to have more than a billion dollars stashed away
at the time of his death Friday in a gunfight with police.
   Rodriguez Gacha, 42, was one of the leaders of the Medellin
cartel, which along with the Cali cartel is responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States.
   Rodriguez Gacha had a grade school education and went from pig
farming to bartending. In the 1970s he became a hired killer for a
Colombian gangster trying to gain control of emerald mines.
   He became feared throughout the tropical areas of central
Colombia, killing emerald buyers and stealing their wares.
   He also became wealthy and surrounded himself with bodyguards
and beautiful women.
   About 10 years ago he became aware of the immense appetite for
drugs in the United States and began using his emerald-war profits
to buy cocaine base from Bolivia to be processed into pure cocaine.
   By 1984 he had so much money he was giving some away.
   When the southern city of Popayan was devastated by a 1984
earthquake, Rodriguez Gacha was seen walking through the ruined
city giving money to stunned survivors.
   He and other major drug traffickers banded together to form the
Medellin cartel, named after the northwestern city of Medellin
where smugglers traditionally had their headquarters.
   Rodriguez Gacha had many ranches, but perhaps his favorite was
at Pacho, 50 miles north of Bogota.
   After the government declared war against the drug dealers last
August when a presidential candidate was assassinated the army
occupied the Pacho ranch. Many peasants in the area told an
Associated Press reporter at the time of the takeover that
Rodriguez Gacha was generous.
   They said he gave away thousands of dollars, providing money for
medical treatment and for seed and farm equipment when they could
not get loans from the government's farm bank.
   Police acknowledged that Rodriguez Gacha's popularity with
peasants had made it difficult to trap him.
   An American diplomat, speaking with the condition of anonymity,
told journalists three months ago that Rodriguez Gacha and other
traffickers had hundreds of people on their payrolls to help watch
for police raids.
   A vendor in a town square would be paid $50 a month to watch for
security forces heading toward Rodriguez Gacha's ranch, the
diplomat said, and a police colonel might be paid $15,000 a month
for information.
   But if Rodriguez Gacha was a saint to some Colombians he was a
monster to others.
   Authorities said he was behind the Aug. 18 murder of Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan, one of the country's leading presidential candidates
who was shot down while addressing a campaign rally.
   Galan had called for more energetic action against drug
traffickers.
   Rodriguez Gacha also was responsibile for the killing in 1988 of
Jaime Pardo Leal, leader of the left-wing Patriotic Union Party,
authorities said. More than 700 members of the Patriotic Union have
been slain the past four years.
   Rodriguez Gacha was accused of paying right-wing death squads to
kill peasants suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas.
   Officials said Rodriguez Gacha was enraged by the guerrillas'
attempts to extort money from ranchers in areas where he owned
property and vowed to exterminate them and any of their
sympathizers.

<TEXT>
   A thief who ransacked a house, raided
the refrigerator, unwrapped about 40 Christmas presents and made
off with some of the gifts apparently had a change of heart.
   The thief returned the packages the next day with about $5 in
change and this note:
   ``Please forgive me. Here are your belongings and some money to
fix the window. It may not be enough, but I'll keep bringing some
til I pay you back fully. I'm very sorry. Please accept my apology
and please don't send me away.''
   Pam Shigley, 31, said the presents were found Thursday on her
porch by her 10-year-old daughter, Kim, with about $5 in nickels
and dimes. Mrs. Shigley said the money probably came from a change
jar that the thief spilled in the house the day before.
   The presents were in their original boxes. ``I was amazed. My
heart was broke when they all got stolen,'' she said. ``When they
came back, I thought, `Jesus, people really do have a conscience.'''
   Mrs. Shigley said she may return the favor. ``I thought of
leaving a note out there to wish him a merry Christmas and thank
him for having a conscience, and I've even thought of leaving a
small gift out there for him.''
   Her other daughter, Stephanie, 12, arrived home from school
Wednesday to find the back door window broken.
   ``Apparently, they came in and made themselves at home. There
was cereal and chocolate cookies and cherry pie filling laying
out,'' Mrs. Shigley said. She later said she believes only one
thief was involved.
   The presents under the family Christmas tree were unwrapped, and
about seven were missing. ``The rest were open for everybody to
see,'' she said. ``All my kids know all their surprises.''
   Springdale, a city of about 23,000 people in the northwestern
corner of Arkansas, is about 100 miles east of Tulsa, Okla.

   A model rocket was undamaged after being

see if it could survive high-speed impact with water, the Navy said
Friday.
   The model rocket was traveling at more than 120 mph when it hit
the water in the test Thursday, the Navy said in a statement. Later
tests will involve speeds up to 200 mph.
   The test along the California's central coast was to help

   ``Gone With the Wind'' turned 50 years old
Friday, but it will never age in the eyes of the fans who gathered
for a gala ``re-premiere'' of the blockbuster Civil War movie.
   ``It's part of our blood,'' said Kim Mills of New York, who
traveled South with his mother and sister to attend the week-long
celebration marking the anniversary of the movie's Dec. 15, 1939,
premiere.
   Butterfly McQueen, the child-voiced actress who played the slave
Prissy in the movie, didn't attend the premiere in 1939, when the
Loews was a whites-only theater. But she stole the show Friday
night at the Fox Theatre, entertaining the crowd with lines from
her role and a song to the tune of the ``Tara'' theme.
   Hers was the biggest applause when the surviving cast members
were introduced by talk show host Larry King, but the real star of
the show was the movie itself.
   The crowd applauded everything _ from the title as it swept
across the screen to the stars' names as the credits were rolled.
   Many of the fans came to the reception and screening dressed in
antebellum costumes.
   Mary Burleston of Amboy, Ill., wore her wedding dress, altered
with a hoop and green trim to resemble an 1860s ball gown. Her
friend, Michele Viola of Aurora, Ill., rented her hoop skirt from a
costume shop.
   ``They said it (antebellum attire) was optional, but we thought,
`Why not?''' said Ms. Viola, whose trip to Atlanta was a Christmas
gift from her aunt.
   Fans from as far away as Australia came for the event, but the
crowd was far smaller than the million or so who waited in the cold
to see Clark Cable and Vivien Leigh on that Friday night in 1939.
   Then, the crowd was so thick that one man perched on a street
sign for hours in hopes of catching a glimpse of the stars as they
passed in a 30-car motorcade on Peachtree Street to the Loews Grand
Theatre.
   Margaret Mitchell, the home-grown author whose Pulitzer
Prize-winning book became one of the world's most popular movies,
also rode in the parade down the street where she was raised.
   This time, only a few hundred people gathered in cold, cloudy
weather to watch a re-creation of the motorcade.
   And this time, only 10 minor cast members were in town for the
festivities. The two top stars both died in the 1960s, and Miss
Mitchell died in 1949.
   The parade didn't head for the Loews Grand either. It was torn
down after being gutted by fire in 1978. The theater's stand-in for
the ``re-premiere'' was the Fox, an ornate 1920s movie palace that
was restored in the 1970s.
   Ted Turner, the Atlanta media mogul who acquired the rights to
``Gone With the Wind'' in 1985 when he bought MGM-UA Entertainment
Corp.'s huge film library, appeared with the cast members at an
antebellum ball Thursday night at the Georgia International
Convention and Trade Center.
   Only about 1,500 of the 3,000 tickets to the ball were sold, but
there were plenty of would-be Scarlett O'Haras and Rhett Butlers in
the crowd. A replica of Tara, Scarlett's plantation home, decorated
the banquet area.
   Turner, whose colorizing of many classic black-and-white movies
has made him a controversial figure in the motion picture industry,
was dressed in a cream-colored frock coat.
   As he greeted the ball-goers, he quipped, ``All I can say is,
thank God they shot `Gone With the Wind' in color.''

<TEXT>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on Friday
stalled defense attorneys' efforts to have death row inmate
Clarence Brandley released on bail, ending his hopes of freedom by
Christmas.
   The court, which overturned Brandley's capital murder conviction
earlier this week, ruled Friday that a Galveston judge would have
to prove he had jurisdiction in the case before a bond hearing set
for Monday could take place.
   Defense attorney Mike DeGeurin said the ruling essentially puts
an end to efforts to free Brandley before Christmas _ or even
before a third trial could take place.
   ``The announcement of the (prosecutor's) filing of a new trial
effectively denies any hope of Clarence Brandley being freed or
even coming off death row,'' DeGeurin said.
   Montgomery County District Attorney Peter Speers said Thursday
he would ask the appellate court to reverse its decision and,
failing that, would retry Brandley for the capital murder.
   Speers filed a motion with the Court of Criminal Appeals asking
the court to prevent the Galveston judge from conducting the bond
hearing in the meantime.
   The appeals court said the Galveston judge would have until Jan.
2 to prove why he has jurisdiction to decide bail for Brandley.
   DeGeurin, however, said he had decided to withdraw his motion
for bail from the Galveston court. He said Brandley's release would
be stalled until the Court of Criminal Appeals issues a decision on
the prosecutor's request that it reverse its decision.
   ``I'm disappointed that the prosecution hasn't gone ahead and
dismissed the indictment and instead is seeking to keep Clarence on
death row while they're asking for a reversal,'' DeGeurin said.
   Brandley, 38, was convicted in the rape-strangulation of
16-year-old Cheryl Dee Fergeson of Bellville, who was killed in
1980 while attending a volleyball tournament at Conroe High School.
   The appeals court Wednesday set aside the verdict, saying
Brandley did not receive a fair trial.
   Brandley, who is black, was a janitor at the school when Miss
Fergeson was attacked. Miss Fergeson was white. Brandley supporters
contend the former janitor's conviction was racially motivated.
   Brandley's first trial ended with a hung jury. In the second
trial, an all-white jury convicted him of capital murder and
sentenced him to death. He has come within six days of execution.

   Police who had stalked him for months
killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the most powerful cocaine
barons, in a shootout Friday near Covenas, a port on the Caribbean.
   Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Fredy and five bodyguards
were killed in the shootout 360 miles north of Bogota at a ranch
owned by Pablo Escobar, another kingpin in Colombia's
multibillion-dollar drug empire, national police chief Miguel Gomez
Padilla said. No mention was made of police casualties.
   President Bush called President Virgilio Barco Friday night and
congratulated him and the Colombian police on the death of the
42-year-old trafficker, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez said in a
television interview.
   The gunfight was at a ranch only 70 miles south of Cartagena,
the city where Bush is to meet in February with the presidents of
Latin America's three major drug-producing countries _ Barco, Alan
Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.
   Maza, commander of the federal investigative police, said police
had been pursuing Rodriguez Gacha, the No. 2 man in the Medellin
cartel, for 70 hours in the Covenas coastal zone before catching up
with him.
   Rodriguez Gacha was on the list of a dozen Colombian drug
traffickers most wanted by the U.S. Justice Department.
   Maza said telephone switchboards at police stations and the
presidential palace were flooded with congratulatory calls.
   ``The country and the world have received this news with
satisfaction,'' he said. ``We know this because of the quantity of
calls from citizens, from women crying with joy because the head of
the most dangerous and forceful terrorist organization on earth has
just died.''
   But he said Rodriguez Gacha's death would not end terrorist
violence in Colombia.
   ``We cannot say that we have broken the back of organized crime,
but since its head has lost its brain, what follows will be a
little easier.'' he said.
   Police will know concentrate efforts to capture Escobar, Maza
said. ``We just need a little luck like we had today with Rodriguez
Gacha.''
   Escobar, a former pickpocket who leads the Medellin operation
and remains at large, was believed to be in the area of the ranch
at the time of the shootout, Interior Minister Carlos Lemos said in
a televised interview.
   Lemos did not elaborate except to say sternly to the camera,
``Individuals who are involved in crime will end up like Rodriguez
Gacha ended up.''
   Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha, nicknamed ``El Mexicano'' because
of his fondness for anything Mexican, have been the objects of
manhunts by U.S. and Colombian authorities since Barco ordered a
crackdown on drug traffickers after a opposition presidential
candidate was slain Aug. 18.
   Police earlier reported 11 bodyguards among the dead before
downgrading that at a news conference to five.
   ``The operation to locate Rodriguez Gacha was an intellegence
operation of great care,'' Gen. Carlos Arturo Casadiego, assistant
director of the national police, said in an interview with the
Caracol radio network.
   In Washington, William Bennett, national drug control policy
director, said Barco told him the news by telephone call.
   Bennett said the fugitives ``resisted police efforts to arrest
them, opening fire on Colombian authorities. Colombian police
returned fire, killing Rodriguez Gacha, his son, and 10 or more
cartel bodyguards.''
   Authorities say Rodriguez Gacha and Escobar planned the Dec. 8
bombing of the federal investigative police headquarters in
downtown Bogota. The blast, which left a huge crater, killed 63
people and injured an estimated 1,000 people.
   The bombing was the most brazen by the traffickers, who have
mounted dozens of attacks to retaliate for the extradition of 10
drug suspects to the United States.
   A total of 209 people have been killed in bombings and
assassinations. Among those killed in the bombings have been 50
judges, two newspaper publishers and the chief of the narcotics
police.
   The two men also were accused in the Nov. 27 bombing of a
Colombian domestic jetliner just outside Bogota that killed all 107
people aboard.
   In October, the government offered $581,000 for the capture of
either man.
   Rodriguez Gacha, who died a billionaire, was a pig farmer before
he got into the cocaine business.
   Among his victims, according to Colombian authorities, was the
president of the leftist Patriotic Union party, Jaime Pardo Leal,
assassinated Oct. 12, 1988.
   He also was accused of several massacres of peasants believed to
sympathize with leftist guerrillas. He was said to be financing
right-wing death squads that have killed hundreds of other leftists.
   In addition to wars with the government and peasants, Rodriguez
Gacha also fought the rival cocaine cartel in Cali, a southern
city, and was involved in a struggle with other gangsters for
control of Colombia's emerald mines.
   Escobar started out in Medellin, Colombia's second most populous
city and about 200 miles from Bogota, as a petty criminal and car
thief. Now, Forbes magazine ranks him as being worth $2 billion to
$3 billion.
   Rodriguez Gacha was indicted in July 1988 with six other reputed
drug traffickers by a federal grand jury in Miami. He was charged
with importing 1,350 pounds of cocaine into the United States.
   He also was indicted in Miami in 1986 on charges involving the
Medellin Cartel and the importation of 58 tons of cocaine, and
faced charges in New York.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh recently announced that $61.8
million worth of his assets had been frozen in several nations
around the world as a result of a U.S. investigation. Another $20
million was spirited to banks in Panama before U.S. agents could
get court orders blocking the accounts.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokeswoman Harri Kramer said
Colombian national police called the Drug Enforcement
Administration and said of Rodriguez Gacha: ``He's gone. It was a
firefight.'' Kramer said.
   Casadiego said the operation Friday was proof Colombian police
have ``the capacity to fight drug traffickers'' and ``there is
sufficient political will'' in the country to carry the battle
forward.
   Until the shootout Friday, authorities had captured and
extradited 10 middle-level drug trafficking suspects but had not
caught any of the 12 suspected traffickers most wanted by the
United States.
   The police said they had come close in the last two months to
catching several members of the Medellin Cartel, including Escobar
and Jorge Luis Ochoa, another of the top three leaders.
   A judge released Fredy Rodriguez three weeks ago from a Bogota
jail, where he had been held for three months. The judge said he
released him because it was illegal under Colombian law to lock up
people under 18.

   World leaders and human rights activists heaped praise Friday on
Andrei D. Sakharov, who sacrificed position for principle,
disdained his persecutors and became a universal symbol of the
unquenchable human spirit.
   The 68-year-old Soviet scientist and humanist died Thursday
night of an apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment.
   On Friday morning, the Soviet Congress stood in a minute of
silent mourning for a fellow member, who first was a national hero
for building the hydrogen bomb, then reviled for insisting on human
freedom, and finally released from internal exile by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in 1986.
   One legislator called him a man ``such as maybe appears once in
a hundred years.''
   President Gorbachev, with whom Sakharov had several
confrontations, said he ``was a man of conviction and sincerity. He
was not some sort of political intriguer. He was a person who had
his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and
directly. This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on many
things we did agree.''
   President Bush said: ``All of us who knew him will never forget
his courage and devotion to freedom. In the darkest hours of his
struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, he embodied all that
is good and decent in the human spirit.''
   To Margaret Thatcher, prime minister of Britain, Sakharov was
``a remarkable person. There was this fantastic courage, and among
the scientific people there was a tremendous capacity for original
thought.
   ``It did not stop with the science, but went into freedom,
liberty, politics and culture. He worked so hard for everything
that is coming to pass in the Soviet Union. He was one of those who
would always say the truth must be found and was never afraid of
stating that and letting everyone know.''
   ``It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future
of the Soviet Union.''
   Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity trade union and a
fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was ``a
great loss for reform. ... It is very bad that God's sentences are
such. We needed this man.''
   In a telegram to Sakharov's wife, Yelena Bonner, he said: ``The
wave of reforms that he has fought for flows over all Eastern
Europe today.''
   Vaclav Havel, the human rights activist who appears close to
becoming the new president of Czechoslovakia, said Sakharov's work
was ``one of the cornerstones of the future European home and
worldwide understanding.''
   ``A towering figure of his time'' was how U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar described Sakharov. ``His life spanned a
period of immense complexity and change in the history of his
country,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson of Sweden and
Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch premier, were among the many leaders who
sent telegrams or praised Sakharov.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France sent a message to Mrs.
Sakharov saying her husband knew ``better than anyone else ... how
to reconcile scientific discipline with humanist values. He leaves
the memory of a rouser of conscience and indefatigable defender of
human dignity.''
   Aase Lionaes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that
awarded Sakharov the Peace Prize in 1975, said he ``fell in the
struggle for democratic reforms. His death represents a great loss,
especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the
Soviet Union and in all Eastern Europe.''
   Norwegian painter Victor Sparre, an old friend, called Sakharov
``the greatest reconciler of our century. He gave his life for
other people's freedom.''
   ``We have lost our moral compass,'' said Roald Sagdeyev, former
head of the Soviet space program, who worked with Sakharov in the
Congress of People's Deputies and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel said: ``We are pained by
the loss of the great fighter for human rights, for the rights of
Soviet Jews and prisoners of Zion. Andrei Sakharov will always be
remembered as the man who deserves great appreciation by the Jewish
people.''
   Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet labor camps and
immigrated to Israel in 1986, said: ``Sakharov had tremendous
influence ... among dissidents, among free people in the Soviet
Union, and ... by his own personal example helped change the whole
climate in the Soviet Union.''
   Marie Staunton, director of the human rights group Amnesty
International, said Sakharov ``represented a whole generation of
people ... in what seemed at that time a hopeless situation.
Everybody looked up to him, his death is really the end of an era.''
   In Beijing, however, China's official media Saturday carried
only one-sentence reports of Sakharov's death without mentioning
his role as the Soviet Union's leading dissident.
   Earlier this week, in protests over the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize
awarded to Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, the Chinese
press also criticized Sakharov's receiving the prize in 1975.

<HEAD>Church Official Sentenced in Illegal Weapons Conspiracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An official of a Montana-based church was
sentenced Friday to a month in prison and three months home
detention for his role in a scheme to buy paramilitary weapons
illegally.
   U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush told Edward L. Francis,
39, that his crime merited prison time because of his position as a
leader of the Church Universal and Triumphant of Corwin Springs,
Mont.
   The sect's theology draws from tenets of Christian, Eastern
mystic and New Age religions, as well as conservative political
philosophy. Church leaders continually denied rumors that weapons
were being stockpiled for the aftermath of a predicted nuclear war.
   Francis is the church's business manager and husband of church
leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who did not accompany her husband
to the federal court hearing.
   Francis pleaded guilty in October to one count of conspiracy to
make a false statement in acquisition of a firearm. He was accused
of giving nearly $150,000 in cash and gold to another church
member, Vernon Hamilton, who used fake names to purchase
large-caliber semiautomatic weapons and ammunition.
   The church's governing board said it had not authorized any
church money for the guns. The money involved was Francis' own from
an inheritance.
   The weapons _ .50-caliber assault rifles, armor-piercing
ammunition and sniper rifles _ could have been purchased legally
with proper identification.
   In addition to the prison term, Quackenbush imposed a strict
three-month home detention sentence under which Francis's movements
will be monitored electronically. He will be allowed to leave his
home only for church services and certain appointments.
   Francis also was fined $5,000 and placed on two years of
supervised release, meaning he would be returned to prison to serve
the entire two years should he violate terms of his release.
   ``I am extremely sorry for the acts I took and the involvement I
had in this,'' Francis told the judge prior to sentencing. ``There
simply is no excuse.''
   Hamilton, the church's reputed security chief, was given three
years probation and fined $1,000 on Dec. 1 after pleading guilty to
a conspiracy count.

<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 3-4: ``Speaking briefly,'' Bush remarks by telephone;
Sullivan appearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush canceled a trip to Manhattan
and a speech Friday night to the 80th convention of the NAACP
because he has laryngitis and there could be bad weather in New
York.
   Even before the trip was scrapped, Bush's prepared address had
been shortened to about eight minutes because of his ailment.
   Speaking briefly by telephone to the gathering, Bush apologized
for not being there and said, ``I will use my office to speak out
against racism and bigotry wherever it is found.''
   Stepping in at the last minute, Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan quoted from portions of Bush's speech.
   White House officials also had considered the possibility that
Bush would go to New York and sit on the stage as his speechwas
delivered by one of his aides, Roger Porter.
   In the end, the White House said Bush's laryngitis and
deterioriating weather conditions in New York prompted the decision
to cancel the trip. The National Weather Service issued a storm
warning for New York and predicted possible heavy snow,
accumulating four to six inches, along with heavy winds.
   The White House said the prospect of poor visibility would have
curtailed plans for Bush to fly by helicopter from Newark to
midtown Manhattan.
   The announcement of the trip's cancellation came too late for
dozens of members of the White House press corps. They had flown
ahead of the president on a chartered airliner and were landing in
Newark when the decision was made to drop the trip and for them to
return.

<HEAD>Appeal Rejected of Woman Convicted in Daughter's Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has upheld the
convictions of a woman who forced her daughter to work as a
strip-tease dancer and was prosecuted for child abuse after the
girl committed suicide.
   Theresa Jackson's appeal seeking to overturn her 1987
convictions on charges of child abuse, forgery and procuring a
sexual performance by a child was rejected Wednesday by the Fourth
District Court of Appeals.
   Jackson, 42, of Coral Springs, altered her daughter's
identification before forcing her to get the job dancing nude at an
adult club, court testimony showed.
   Her daughter, 17-year-old Tina Mancini, shot herself to death in
March 1986. Testimony at the subsequent trial showed Jackson
ordered her underage daughter to perform at nude bars, then
collected most of the girl's earnings.
   No date of surrender has been set yet for Jackson, who has been
free on $4,500 bail, working as a cab driver. She was sentenced in
1987 to 364 days in prison, followed by two years of house arrest
and two more years of probation.
   ``They shoot horses, don't they?'' Jackson said after learning
of the appeals court opinion. ``Why don't they do that with me and
get it over with? I wish they would have done it a long time ago.''
   The trial was believed to be the first use of a psychological
autopsy in a criminal case involving suicide. In rejecting the
appeal, the justices approved the use of the evidence in Jackson's
trial.
   ``We are satisfied,'' the justices wrote in their opinion,
``that ... the psychological autopsy is accepted in the field of
psychiatry as a method of evaluation for use in cases involving
suicide, and that the trial judge acted within his discretion in
admitting this evidence at trial.''

<TEXT>
   CBS, facing a third season as No. 3 in prime
time ratings, reached agreement Friday with movie executive Jeff
Sagansky to be its new programs chief, sources close to the
negotiations said.
   The move comes two weeks after the resignation of his
predecessor, Kim LeMasters, who resigned as CBS Entertainment
president after only two years in the job.
   Although CBS officials declined to comment and a spokesman for
Sagansky said ``there is no announcement yet,'' one executive who
asked not to be named said Sagansky's hiring would be announced
Monday by CBS and Columbia Studios.
   The delay, the executive explained, was to allow for ``an
orderly transition'' at both companies. Columbia, based in Burbank,
Calif., owns Tri-Star Pictures, of which Sagansky has been
president since March this year.
   CBS' agreement with Sagansky had been expected. But it was
delayed by extended negotiations between CBS and Columbia Studios
for the release of Sagansky from his Tri-Star contract, CBS
officials have said.
   Ironically, CBS previously considered him for the job before
deciding on LeMasters in 1987. Sagansky was wooed again before and
after CBS' unsuccessfully bid last week to lure to its vacant job a
top TV production team, Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner. Their company
makes NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ABC's ``Roseanne,'' the nation's
two highest-rated series.
   Sagansky, who will be responsible for CBS' entire program
schedule, faces a large task of restoration in coming months at the
once-dominant network that last month suffered its worst-ever
November ratings.
   Although its daytime schedule emerged first in the November
ratings ``sweeps,'' CBS' prime time programs, late-night ``The Pat
Sajak Show'' and ``CBS This Morning'' all were third in network
ratings.
   However, the morning program, usually third in ratings even when
CBS enjoyed prime time success, showed slight improvement when its
ratings were compared with those of November last year.
   In prime time, though, CBS slipped two-tenths of a ratings point
in November. It averaged a 12.0 rating, a full ratings point behind
ABC and 3.1 points behind first-place NBC.
   A ratings point represents 921,000 homes, and in prime time can
be worth between $120 million and $140 million annuallly to a
network.
   The results of the quarterly sweeps periods are most important
to affiliates, which use them to set their own advertising rates
for the next three months.
   Although some CBS programs like ``Murphy Brown'' and the
recently returned ``Beauty and the Beast'' have gotten critical
praise, CBS hasn't had a hit series since the debut of ``Murder,
She Wrote'' in 1984.
   In news, Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' broadcast, once
usually first in ratings, also is showing signs of slipping.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' has won in ratings for the last two
weeks. In the last ten weeks, that broadcast, anchored by Peter
Jennings, has won eight times and tied twice with Rather's program
in the Nielsens.

<TEXT>
   Kraft General Foods has withdrawn
financial support for its coveted $200,000 World Food Prize, given
yearly to a scientist for agricultural research in Third World
countries, company officials said Friday.
   ``Funding for the prize was always decided on a year-to-year
basis,'' said Kraft spokesman Michael Mudd in a telephone
interview. ``We believe the award should succeed in establishing
broad-based support from other corporations.''
   The 3-year-old prize has been awarded to scientists for
achievements in developing new crops and livestock systems to help
feed underdeveloped regions of the world.
   The announcement of the funding cut-off came nine months after
General Foods and Kraft merged to form Glenview-based Kraft General
Foods. Both are subsidiaries of New York-based Philip Morris
Companies, the giant food and tobacco concern.
   ``It's a shame,'' said David L. Call, dean of the College of
Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.
   ``Hunger has become sort of old hat to people, but there still
are an awful lot of people out there who go without,'' said Call,
who is on a seven-member council of advisers for the prize.
   Dr. Robert Chandler, who won the award in 1988 for his work as
director of the International Rice Institute in the Philippines,
said losing the annual prize could mean fewer important discoveries.
   ``It's a stimulation and something to be hoped and aimed for,''
Chandler, 82, said in a telephone interview from his Clermont,
Fla., home.
   This year's prize was awarded to Dr. Verghesi Kurien of India
for pioneering work in establishing a dairy cooperative system. Dr.
M. Swamanathan, also of India, won in 1987 for his work in
improving production of rice and wheat in that country.

   A Soviet envoy on Friday rejected a U.S.
appeal for a joint effort to repeal a 1975 U.N. resolution that
equates Zionism with racism.
   ``We consider that there is no need for this kind of action,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky told a news conference.
   Responding to a question, he said his government would not join
the United States on behalf of Israel to repeal the measure
``because if this question will be raised, there no doubt will be
confrontation in the United Nations and that will go far beyond the
discussion of Middle East questions and have a negative effect on
the whole state of affairs in the United Nations.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle told U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar Monday that the United States is seeking repeal of
the Arab and Soviet-backed resolution.
   The United States and Soviet Union have frequently worked
together this year to achieve consensus instead of calling for
divisive votes.
   Washington recently lauded the Soviet Union for urging Arab
nations to back away from demanding national observer status for
the Palestine Liberation Organization.

   The Soviet Union is eager to enter into
oil well service contracts and joint ventures with U.S. petroleum
producers, Soviet officials told oil and gas executives.
   The 11 Soviet petroleum officials were on a two-day trip to the
oil-rich Permian Basin in west Texas to see how Americans pump
hard-to-get oil from the ground. The Soviet Union is the world's
largest oil producer, but increasingly is having problems
recovering crude from marginal wells.
   ``If we are able to execute one joint venture tonight, we will
have considered our mission here to have been a success,'' Yuri
Vershinin, senior engineer for a Siberian oil- and gas-producing
region, said at a vendors' reception Wednesday night.
   ``I am absolutely certain we can work together,'' said Vitali F.
Lasnichi, senior engineer for the Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas,
adding that both sides can learn from each other.
   Representatives from 60 U.S. companies, from oil titans to tong
manufacturers, attended Wednesday's reception, though no
joint-venture deals were struck for Soviet oil exploration.
   Joint ventures are possible because Soviet petroleum-producing
regions have autonomous power to execute their own deals, using oil
in place of hard currency, said Louis Mazzullo, who coordinated the
tour for the West Texas Geological Society.
   The value of the ruble is kept artificially high by the Soviets,
preventing the currency from being converted on foreign exchange
markets.
   Ampir S. Sytrlanov, senior engineer for the Bashkiria producing
region in the Ural Mountains, said he was interested in joint
ventures in horizontal drilling.
   Other Soviet officials said they were interested in gaining
American expertise in enhanced oil recovery, deep drilling, gas
processing and recycling and hydrogen sulfide safety.
   ``It's difficult to execute business deals in three days,''
Mazzullo said, ``but at least the ground work for future business
dealings between the Permian Basin and the Soviet Union has been
done.''

<HEAD>Cuomo Signs Bill Allowing Staten Island Secession Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staten Island residents won the chance to
secede from New York City under a bill signed Friday by Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
   ``There are no dispositive, substantive arguments offered
against the bill,'' Cuomo said.
   The bill gives Staten Island residents the chance to vote next
year on whether to establish a commission to draw up a new
government. After at least three years, the actual question of
secession and the form of a new government would go to the voters
again.
   Secession has long been sought by some residents of New York
City's smallest borough, who complain they have little voice in
city affairs compared to residents of more populous Manhattan, the
Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.
   Staten Island, nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide, is 2{
times the size of Manhattan. Yet the 400,000 mostly middle-class
residents of the island are only a fraction of the city's 7 million
residents.
   ``I want to congratulate the governor on his prudent decision,''
said state Sen. John Marchi, a Staten Island Republican and chief
sponsor of the bill. ``It comes as an early Christmas present for
me and, I believe, for the people of Staten Island.''
   The secession movement gained steam last spring with a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that New York City's form of government was
unconstitutional.
   Staten Islanders feared that a new government drawn up by a
charter revision commission would give them even less power.
   The secession bill was passed by the Legislature on the final
night of its 1989 session, yet was held back from the governor's
desk for several months by Marchi.
   The measure was opposed by New York City officials worried about
the loss of tax revenue from Staten Island residents. Mayor Edward
I. Koch argued that voters in the entire city, not just Staten
Island, should vote on secession.
   Cuomo said that there's ``more than enough time'' to deal with
the opponents' objections.
   He did, however, attach one condition to his signature. Cuomo
said he wants new legislation requiring that any new charter that
is adopted by Staten Island voters also be subsequently approved by
the state Legislature. Marchi has agreed to sponsor such
legislation next year, said his spokesman Charles Dumas.
   New York City Mayor-elect David Dinkins said Staten Island has
been an integral part of the city since it joined in 1898.
   ``The law allows the residents of the borough to reconsider this
historic relationship,'' Dinkins said. ``It is my hope that after
they complete their evaluation, they will choose to remain part of
America's greatest city.''
   U.S. Rep. Guy Molinari, who becomes Staten Island borough
president on January 1, said the chances of Staten Island
eventually seceding are ``very, very slim'' because if secession
benefits the island financially, legislators from other parts of
the state won't approve it.
   If it doesn't benefit Staten Islanders, voters there would turn
it down, he said. ``So it may be nothing more than a cruel hoax,''
Molinari said.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ferdinand Marcos, the late deposed ruler of the
Philippines, was found liable Friday in the 1981 murders of two
anti-Marcos activists in Seattle.
   Marcos' estate and his widow, Imelda, were ordered to pay more
than $15 million to the survivors of Silme Donigo and Gene Viernes.
   Family members and supporters of the plaintiffs cried as U.S.
District Judge Barbara Rothstein read the unanimous verdicts, and
erupted in cheers when the judge dismissed the jurors.
   The verdicts found Marcos and his widow were part of a
conspiracy and were negligent in a way that led to the shooting
deaths on June 1, 1981, in offices of the Alaska Cannery Workers
Union.
   A six-member jury deliberated 5 hours before ruling on the
involvement of the Marcoses in the shooting deaths of Domingo and
Viernes.
   ``We were informed today that the jury in Seattle has rendered a
substantial damages award against the estate and myself,'' Mrs.
Marcos said in a statement issued in Honolulu. ``We believe there
are important legal issues in this case which will ultimately cause
the verdict to be reversed. Our lawyers have been instructed to
pursue all appropriate remedies.''
   The civil lawsuit was the first of several legal cases against
the Marcoses to go to trial in this country, according to the
Marcoses' attorney, Richard Hibey of Washington, D.C.
   ``I myself thought that the case was one that could not be
won,'' Hibey said. ``There is an appeal already before the court.''
   Michael Withey, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he would
ask state prosecutors to reopen the criminal investigation in the
case.
   Three men were convicted of murder in 1981 and 1982, but on the
theory that Domingo and Viernes were killed because of an internal
dispute in the union, of which they were reform officers.
   ``Clearly, the foreign head of state of a country has been
implicated in crimes committed in the United States,'' Withey said.
``Other countries, such as El Salvador and South Africa, better not
try the same thing in the U.S.''
   Jurors had to decide whether the Marcoses were part of a
conspiracy that led to the murders and whether they were negligent
in exercising control over their intelligence network.
   A unanimous verdict on either of those questions was sufficient
to find Marcos' estate and Mrs. Marcos liable and subject to
damages.
   Survivors of Domingo were awarded $12,794,000, while Viernes'
survivors were ordered to receive $2,254,000.
   Attorneys for victims' survivors had asked jurors to calculate
the Marcoses' liability at about $10 million.
   The civil trial had a lower standard of proof than the ``beyond
a reasonable doubt'' proof required in criminal trials. The
conspiracy count required a showing of ``clear, cogent and
convincing'' evidence, and the negligence count a showing of a
``preponderance'' of evidence.
   Rothstein will judge liability of the other defendants:
Constantine Baruso, former president of the Alaska Cannery Workers
Union who allegedly paid the murderers and whose gun was used in
the killings; Dr. Leonilo Malabed of San Francisco, a Marcos friend
who allegedly ran an intelligence slush fund that financed the
murder payment; and the three men convicted of the murders.
   Prosecutors who convicted the three in 1981 and 1982 contended
Domingo and Viernes were killed because of an internal union
dispute. They had been elected as reformers of the Alaska Cannery
Workers Union and reportedly had worked against gang influence on
work assignments and gambling in Alaska fish canneries.
   But plaintiffs claimed the men were killed by an intelligence
network, headed by the Marcoses, that harassed and intimidated
activists in the United States who opposed the Marcos' martial-law
regime.
   In testimony during the 3{-week trial:
   _ Marcos, in a video made before his death, admitted he used
four agencies to gather intelligence in the United States. But he
insisted they did nothing more than the normal intelligence
gathering of all nations, that he practiced ``maximum tolerance''
of his opposition, and that he didn't become concerned about
dissidence in the United States until about 1984.
   _ Marcos described Malabed as a friend, but invoked his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked about any
intelligence connections with Malabed and the Mabuhay Corp., which
allegedly was a cover for a slush fund that provided $15,000 for
the murders.
   The Marcoses face several other legal cases against them.
   In October 1988, the Marcoses were charged in a criminal
indictment with siphoning more than $100 million from the
Philippine treasury and funneling it into this country for the
purchase of New York real estate and art. Mrs. Marcoses' trial is
scheduled to begin March 14 in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Hibey said several claims also have been filed in various cities
in which individuals are suing the Marcoses because of torture or
other abuses they allegedly sustained during the Marcos regime.

   The man charged with killing 27 people in
what police call the nation's worst alcohol-related traffic
accident publicly apologized for an act he claims to be unable to
recall.
   Testifying Thursday in front of a chart with the victims'
photographs and names, Larry Mahoney said he had no recollection of
driving the wrong way on Interstate 71 on May 14, 1988, and
colliding with the packed church bus.
   ``It's a fact I was involved in an accident, but I don't
remember seeing the bus,'' Mahoney said. ``I remember waking up in
the hospital.''
   He concluded his 70 minutes on the witness stand by apologizing
to the survivors and families of those maimed or killed in the
disaster.

   Air fare increases that all took effect on the
same day last fall are now being investigated by the Justice
Department for possible antitrust violations.
   Government and industry officials said Thursday that several
airlines have been ordered to supply documents and information
about their ticket-pricing procedures.
   The focus of the inquiry apparently is a system that allows one
air carrier to signal its intention to raise fares, giving others
the opportunity to follow suit before the increase actually takes
effect.
   On Sept. 8, American Airlines filed increases in fares into
computerized systems read by thousands of travel agents and other
airlines. By the time the increases took effect on Sept. 29,
several other airlines had matched the hike, with fares up $10 to
$80 depending on how many days before departure tickets are
purchased.

   Three members of Congress want to know if the
National Institutes of Health are making good on a promise to stop
testing only men when seeking cures to diseases that also affect
women.
   Reps. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, and
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., on Thursday asked the General Accounting
Office to investigate a policy adopted in 1987 after a report from
the Public Health Service showed sex discrimination at NIH clinical
tests.
   ``The gender bias in medical research isn't confined to the lab;
it filters down to the health care that women receive,'' said
Schroeder.
   ``If a woman wants to know if she should take an aspirin every
other day to help prevent heart disease or take a
cholesterol-lowering drug to bring down her cholesterol level, her
doctor won't have the answer. All of the research in this area has
been done on men,'' said the congresswoman.

   Younger people with limited educations are more
likely than anyone to light up and should be the target of
campaigns against cigarettes, a study released by the federal
Centers for Disease Control concluded.
   A 1988 survey of about 20,000 people in 36 states and the
District of Columbia found that less-educated people, who also tend
to be of a lower social and economic status, are more likely to be
smokers.
   ``There has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking. But the
study shows most of the progress is limited to the well-educated,''
said Dr. Luis Escobedo of the Atlanta-based CDC, who analyzed
aspects of the survey released Thursday.
   ``The emphasis must become more targeted,'' he said. ``Some of
that already is being done through substance abuse programs.
Tobacco is an addictive substance.''

<HEAD>Ex-Monty Python Palin Sees the World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Near yuletide last year, Michael Palin was
returning to his London home and family. He recalls the joyous
cries of his children, to wit: ```Got any presents?' I said, `I've
been traveling light.'''
   He sighs. ``The shopping. That was far, far worse than traveling
around the world in 80 days.''
   Which is what the merry-faced member of Monty Python's Flying
Circus had been doing for the British Broadcasting Corp. He
emulated the famed globe-trot of Jules Verne's fictional Phileas
Fogg, traveling only by land and sea.
   He went by train, cargo ship, dhow, ferry, taxi, camel, even a
passing sheik's new red Mercedes. No jumbo jets, though. He didn't
mind: ``I find air travel highly overrated, usually late, and a
sheeplike form of transport.''
   Starting Jan. 7, ``Around the World in 80 Days,'' a seven-part
documentary series about his expedition, will be shown Sundays on
cable's Arts &amp; Entertainment Network, which bought it from the BBC.
   Since his Python days, Palin has been in various movies, some,
like ``Time Bandits'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' with Python
pals. He also has been writing, including a tome for tykes,``Small
Harry and the Toothache Pills.''
   He made a well-received BBC series on train travel in 1980. But
his round-the-world voyage, filmed with a crew of five, was, as a
Python would say, something completely different. What to wear was
only the start.
   ``There's no shop like `Circumnavigators, Inc.,''' he notes.
``But the idea is to take as little as possible.'' For him, this
meant six shirts, three pairs of trousers, and a small bag
containing tapes and a diary book.
   World travelers have been known to unwillingly visit the
wretched nations of Dysentary, Hepatitis, and Mysterious Ailment.
So Palin got an armful of shots, having queried a glober-trotter
who advised: ``Just take everything.''
   He set off from London in the fall last year, proceeding
eastward via the Orient Express, then varied forms of transport,
among them an elderly dhow whose engine failed at midnight in the
Persian Gulf:
   ``It sort of fizzled out, and the captain sort of scratched his
head and said, `Oh, the rubber band broke.'''
   Palin, who at one point suffered food poisoning and several
times found himself behind schedule, also faced much suspicion by
gimlet-eyed border guards in the Middle East.
   At such times, he says, it's often best just to say, ``I'm on a
journey, going somewhere else.'' One guard asked Palin why he was
in Dubai if going to Tokyo. He was told: ``Oh, well, that's a long
story, don't want to bore you.''
   The gate was raised. Off went Palin &amp; Co., proceeding to Bombay,
where he got a shave from a blind barber, thence to Singapore and
the Mysterious Orient. That included a hydrofoil trip up China's
Pearl River and dinner at a small cafe that served only the meat of
poisonous snakes:
   ``They bring the snake to you in a little box, set it down on
the floor, and execute it then and there.''
   A fast, modern cargo ship brought him across the Pacific to Long
Beach, Calif., and the forever-docked Queen Mary, where he spent a
night.
   Amtrak carried him _ save for a hot-air balloon ride in the
Rockies _ to New York. He got home by ship. The worst part of the
whole voyage?
   Palin smiles. ``Well, getting back to London was the worst part
of the journey, getting back just before Christmas. There was a lot
of real mean spirit about the place. I don't know if I was tired or
something.
   ``But people were Christmas shopping and pushing each other,
there were ads everywhere and bands playing and electric bells
ringing.
   ``It seemed just utter madness after what I'd been through,
which was quite a long sea journey, something calm and quite
reflective. It was as if my country didn't match up after a world
of hospitality.''

   Michael Jackson's brain is on a shelf.
   Paul Simon's elephant and Tears for Fears' sun are tucked away
elsewhere at music video director Jim Blashfield's studio.
   The brain is clay, and appears in the video for Jackson's song,
``Leave Me Alone.'' The elephant, which stars in the ``Boy in the
Bubble'' video, is a photograph acquired from a 1950s movie. And
the sun is really a 3-inch paper cutout, stuck to a wall since its
appearance in the ``Sowing the Seeds of Love'' video.
   In the four years since Jim Blashfield &amp; Associates began making
music videos, the director has raked in awards, as well as business
from such musicians as Joni Mitchell and Peter Gabriel, and
Memorex, Public Broadcasting Service and even ``Sesame Street.''
   ``He's one of the top five video makers,'' said Jeff Ayeroff,
president of Virgin Records' U.S. division. ``I deal with this
stuff every day, so I know how good this guy is. So much of what we
see in videos is stupidly exploitative, but his work is sort of a
psychedelic celebration. It makes you walk away and say, `Geez,
that was interesting.'''
   The Jackson piece took a Golden Lion award _ the highest honor _
in the category of commercials, short films and videos at this
year's Cannes Film Festival. It also won the 1989 MTV award for
special effects.
   MTV nominated that reel in five other categories, and has
nominated other Blashfield videos. ``Sowing the Seeds of Love'' was
No. 1 on MTV's Top 20 Video Countdown in October.
   Blashfield's style features colors from some otherworldly
Crayola box, coins and globes spinning through space, and flying
people.
   ``Essentially, you're making up reality,'' Blashfield said.
   In the Jackson video, the star moves through a surreal world of
floating chairs, huge chomping teeth and amusement park rides.
   It took 25 people six months to make the video, which clocks in
at 4 minutes, 45 seconds. It features photo collage animation,
using 24 photographs per second and a total of 6,840 photographs.
   Blashfield's videos aren't just giant grab bags of weird objects
on film. The Jackson video tells a story: Jackson has become an
amusement park and has been tied down like Gulliver by the
nuisances that come with megadoses of fame.
   Blashfield got started in the music video business in 1985, with
the hit video for Talking Heads' ``And She Was.''
   On a whim, his former producer and current houseboat-mate,
Melissa Marsland, sent a copy of their 12-minute ``Suspicious
Circumstances'' film to Talking Heads' management company.
Blashfield got a call a few days later asking if he would like to
make the video for ``And She Was.'' He and his staff _ mostly
part-time temporary employees and some free-lancers _ had just 28
days to make it.
   ``It looked like it might be impossible,'' Blashfield said. He
got so nervous about the production that he once woke up in the
middle of the night thinking, ``Oh God, what have I gotten myself
into? Did I actually say I knew how to do this?''
   Blashfield described work on the videos as collaborative, with
producers handling finances and client relations, supervising
production and helping with creative work. Also involved are
animators, photographers, artists and production assistants.
   ``My job is to come up with ideas and kind of guide people,'' he
said.
   Until the Talking Heads video, Blashfield had been barely
supporting himself with local commercials and documentaries,
animation and experimental films.
   He is 45 now, but his fling with film began at 19. Blashfield
had acted in high school and college productions, and met a
Portland filmmaker, John Rausch, through a play. ``I thought, `God,
I could actually make those things that go up on the screen,''' he
recalled.
   He often looks at photos or objects to develop ideas.
``Sometimes I can see things in my head, but very often my head is
not loaded with images. Once you get a seed of something, it
reminds you of things.''
   Ideas also come from Blashfield's musician clients, with whom he
confers by telephone and in person. Later, his staff spends two or
three days getting the musicians on film.
   Blashfield and company went to Los Angeles to film Michael
Jackson ``flying'' in a toy rocket at a soundstage, but Paul Simon
and Joni Mitchell traveled to Portland for shooting.
   There's no need to move to Los Angeles or New York to be at the
top of his profession, Blashfield said.
   ``I'm in a really fortunate position. What you'll find in L.A.
now is a lot of people trying to figure out how they could live in
a place like Portland and still do national-based work.''
   Blashfield's clients must meet his personal standards.
   Tears for Fears qualified. ``Sowing the Seeds of Love'' is a
humanitarian song with spiritual overtones. The video includes a
striking, seemingly three-dimensional scene of a multifaceted
mandala _ a circular form symbolizing the universe in Eastern
religions.
   ``These guys are very interested in matters of the spirit,''
Blashfield said. ``And I find that I am increasingly, too. ... I'm
starting to look around for where the other dimension to life is.''

<HEAD>Volunteers Help Pets of AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS may rob its victims of their health and
eventually of their lives, but volunteers are making certain the
disease does not deprive them of their loving pets.
   The Pet Owners With AIDS Resource Service, called POWARS for
short, provides food, fun and foster care for the dogs, cats and
other pets of New York City AIDS patients who are too sick to care
for them.
   ``People's first concern has to be themselves. Once they're
attended to, it's time to think about their pet,'' said Steve Kohn,
founder of POWARS.
   ``By the time they get to us, they've been through a nightmare
of federal, state and local red tape. We're trying to take the
chaos out of somebody's life,'' he said.
   Kohn, a City University of New York laboratory technician with
two Boston terriers, founded POWARS in May 1988 with $2,000 of his
own money.
   Now, he and about 200 volunteers help care for some 30 cats, 20
dogs, a bird, a ferret and fish _ the number of pets grows each
week. Some clients get monthly food deliveries, while others need
occasional or constant litter-box cleaning, supplies, grooming and
walking. Some veterinarians donate their services, as well.
   A few clients pay $10 or $15 a month; most get supplies and
services free, thanks to donations to the tax-exempt group.
   When a client is hospitalized, volunteers care for his or her
pet in its own home or a foster home. Permanent homes are sometimes
found when patients die.
   ``It brings tears to my eyes, the organization is so
wonderful,'' said Phyllis, a Manhattan woman with AIDS-related
complex who asked that her last name be omitted.
   ``I know how much love I have for my animal. I depend on her;
there's not as much intimacy with people, sometimes,'' she said of
Suzie, her 3{-year-old mixed Maltese-Yorkshire terrier.
   A friend persuaded Phyllis to call POWARS for help. She
resisted, at first, because ``I had a lot of pride. I want to walk
her as much as I can.''
   Now POWARS provides food, grooming and veterinary care for the
fluffy white dog. ``When I saw how accommodating, nice and sincere
they were, I could let the help in,'' Phyllis said. ``It's possible
I may need more of it sometime down the line.''
   Tony, who has AIDS, gets help with his 10-year-old Yorkie,
Herbie.
   Last summer, Tony was distressed about unemployment and medical
bills. ``On top of that, I was worried about the dog,'' he said.
   Then he learned about POWARS. The service provided minor eye
surgery for Herbie, ``something I couldn't afford. It's a comfort
to know he is well. I can be better; part of it is stress,'' he
said.
   ``I love this dog. He's my friend and foe,'' Tony said,
playfully shaking the tiny dog, who clearly adored him, too. ``He
makes me laugh. He's a little pal. It's better than living with
humans sometimes.''
   Tony had a heart attack in January. ``When I got out of the
hospital and I saw my dog, I cried. Everything else is
dispensable.''
   A neighbor took care of Herbie that time. But Tony feels
confident that POWARS will be there if a friend can't be.
   Another client's relatives asked POWARS for help. The man was
hospitalized and unable to move. ``He talked about his dog, so the
nurses and doctors decided the dog could be brought to the
hospital,'' said Philip Persky, a POWARS volunteer.
   ``The dog came up to his room and jumped on his bed. The
gentleman sat up for the first time,'' said Persky. ``It's more
than a bond; it's a healing process.''
   A trainer teaches volunteers obedience commands and suggests
solutions when a pet exhibits behavior problems. Animals feeling
stress because of their owner's illness often relax once they're
put on a schedule, Kohn said.
   The volunteers are screened to make sure they're sensitive to
the needs of animals and humans.
   ``Asking for help is having to share your animal,'' said Kohn.
``We try to be as non-intrusive as we possibly can. Everybody's
needs are different.''

<HEAD>No Guarantees With Forecasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decade-ahead forecasts have the potential of
landing far off the mark, and generally they fulfill it. Remember
those 1960 forecasts of the checkless society? The cashless society?
   Everyone can cite special examples.
   Did anyone in 1970 foresee the incredible double-digit inflation
and 20 percent interest rates? Of course not. And if seers in the
early 1980s foresaw seven straight years of economic expansion
nobody heard them shouting.
   And the 1990s? Will there be a ``Marshall Plan'' for Eastern
bloc nations whose economies have been stymied by central planning?
Will European economic integration succeed? Your guess is as good
as the CIA's.
   Much of what can indeed be forecast is demographically based.
You can, for example, expect the number of Americans over age 65 to
grow rapidly and baby boomers to become middle-aged. That much is
in the numbers.
   It is clear also that recent immigrants will play an increasing
role in business, a reality borne out by statistics. By the year
2015, for example, Hispanics will comprise the largest minority
segment of the population.
   It is likely also that older people will continue to work, if
their companies let them, because of health improvements and
growing life spans. And that many of them, and younger workers too,
will work from home.
   The latter is based on a continuation of existing trends, which
show both business and individuals utilizing technology _
computers, copiers, facsimiles, telephone lines, answering machines
_ to transport data rather than people.
   In 1988, according to Link Resources Inc., a market research
firm, 4.2 million Americans began working at home for the first
time, up from 2.4 million in 1987. Link foresees more than 30
million in the 1990s.
   Arnold Sanow, a small-business consultant, believes many workers
will have their own businesses. He sees them providing work more
efficiently for larger companies, and even becoming capable of
competing with them.
   ``It's not just young entrepreneurs working from home anymore,''
says Sanow, president of Business Source, based in the Washington,
D.C., area. ``Even large corporations have innovative home work
programs to fit employee needs.''
   Believing the trend will continue, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. employs Sanow as a spokesman for its Toll-Free 800
Business Directory, which has grown from 20,000 listings in 1984 to
more than 120,000 in the latest edition.
   As AT&amp;T sees it, the growth of toll-free numbers also permits
small businesses to operate nationally.
   As callers, it makes it easy for them to acquire information,
goods and services inexpensively from anywhere. As owners of an 800
listing, it permits them to advertise widely and accept sales from
any part of the country.
   In spite of such forecasts, and in fact the likelihood that they
will be correct, nobody can say for certain that working at home
will continue to grow as anticipated. Some other development,
inconceivable now, could thwart it.
   But it is such demographically and actuarily based forecasts
that seem most likely to come true. If in 1989 there are a certain
number of people aged 60, it can be fairly well predicted how many
will be 70 in 1999.
   Combined with current trends, such as the work-at-home movement
and the development of technology that makes it more efficient to
transport information than people, such forecasts have at least a
fair chance.
   A better chance, certainly, than those economic forecasts about
inflation and recession which carry guarantees that, at best, are
good for a few months.

<HEAD>Of Life and Death and Compound Q</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a week for three weeks, AIDS patient
Robert Pitman sat for four hours in a doctor's office near his San
Francisco home receiving a drug smuggled from China.
   That this treatment was not government-sanctioned did not
concern him. Nor did he have second thoughts when two others in the
trial died. For Pitman, the decision to participate in this
renegade test of the drug known as Compound Q was a matter of his
own life and death.
   ``I'm a 48-year-old man and if I don't do something, I doubt
that I'm going to see 50. That is not acceptable to me,'' Pitman
said in an interview. ``I may go down, but I'm going to go down
fighting.''
   Pitman, a playwright, said he feels the government has failed
him by not moving more quickly to get promising AIDS drugs to him
and the tens of thousands of others with the disease or its early
symptoms.
   But he and other AIDS activists are not so quick these days to
heap blame on the Food and Drug Administration, the government
agency that decides whether new drugs are safe and effective enough
to be marketed.
   Although people with AIDS remain frustrated by the weight of the
FDA bureaucracy, ``there's a little more willingness to believe in
their good will'' in light of several new drug approvals this year,
said Mark Harrington of the New York-based AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power.
   Many, however, say it is the determination of AIDS patients like
Pitman that has pushed the FDA to relax the rules and speed the
process that still averages more than four years to grant approval
to a drug.
   Pitman said treatments last June with Compound Q, derived from
the roots of Chinese plants similar to cucumbers, appear to have
slowed progress of his disease and gave him more energy and an
improved appetite. But he said the benefits waned and he hopes to
resume treatments soon.
   Martin Delaney, organizer of the underground study begun in May,
announced in September that test results indicated Compound Q had
``a significant effect'' and could be valuable in combination with
other drugs.
   An FDA-approved study of Compound Q is being conducted elsewhere
in San Francisco, but Pitman and others said it was running far
behind the secret experiments.
   ``If you're talking about a cure for dandruff, I'd say OK,''
Pitman said. ``But you're talking about a life expectancy of 16
months. ... It would have been a year from now before they
(researchers in the official trial) found out what we found out in
six weeks.''
   When the FDA learned of the secret trials, it did not crack its
regulatory whip, as might have happened before, but took a more
conciliatory approach. The agency invited Delaney to bring his data
to Washington and talk about conducting further trials under FDA
sanction.
   Delaney, in a move reflecting the growing cooperation between
AIDS activists and the government, accepted the offer and agreed to
stop the trials and retreatments of patients until new trials were
approved.
   ``You have to adjust the rules for the reality of the
epidemic,'' Delaney has said. ``Where the FDA has been slow is in
changing the height of the hurdle, accepting the need to make
adjustments, but I think we may be getting there.''
   ``The epidemic of AIDS is extraordinary and must be met with
extraordinary measures,'' then-FDA Commissioner Frank Young said
earlier this year in announcing his agency's decision to expand
availability of the anti-AIDS drug dideoxyinosine, known as ddI,
while still in the early stages of testing.
   The FDA says a study shows it has shaved more than three years
off the average time it takes to move a life-saving drug from
initial tests to approval, cutting the period to about 4.2 years.
Paul Coppinger, deputy associate commissioner for planning and
evaluation, said most of the time saved comes from more efficient
clinical trials and speedier delivery of test results to the FDA.
   Last year, the agency said desperately ill patients can import
drugs approved in other countries but not here. Regulators also are
helping move drug tests from university medical centers and
government research laboratories into neighborhood clinics
accessible to more patients.
   In explaining the relaxation of some of the rules that had
stretched the time needed to prove drugs safe and effective, Young
spoke of the urgency facing AIDS patients: ``These are people that
have no alternative therapy, so that medicine becoming available as
early as possible really makes the difference between life and
death.''
   Throughout his illness, Pitman said, he has researched all
available therapies, keeping up on the approved drugs, looking for
clinical trials of promising drugs and finding all he could about
untested therapies.
   ``I'm not advocating going off willy-nilly, popping things in
your mouth,'' he said.
   Rather, he is following his belief in individual responsibility,
using personal judgment rather than waiting for the government to
act.
   ``Safe and effective is a meaningless phrase for me, because I'm
going to die of AIDS before they know what safe and effective is by
their route,'' he said.

   From the blue-collar housing projects
of cockney east London to the gardens of the gentry, grown men scan
the skies for hours most weekends, waiting for their pigeons to
race home.
   They rhapsodize about pigeon racing, the sport known as ``the
fancy'' and now one of Britain's more popular pastimes.
   ``All you see is a pinprick in the sky,'' said Maj. Edward
Camilleri. ``They fly toward you and you hope its yours. Then they
fold their wings, they drop out of the sky, they literally do. They
come straight down like bullets.''
   Says Bernie Bennett, who has 60 pigeons: ``Unless you're a
pigeon fancier, you just find it very hard to understand, to see a
person out in the garden, like me yesterday, bucketing down with
rain, looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles.
   ``With pigeons I find one thing and one thing only: You're the
jury, you're the prosecution, you are the judge. All that happens
down in your backyard is down to you.''
   Camelleri, a retired soldier who runs the Royal Pigeon Racing
Association, estimates Britain has more than 200,000 pigeon
breeders and racers among its 56 million people.
   Nearly 2 million pigeons, many with meticulously documented
pedigrees dating back several avian generations, are registered
with Camilleri's association alone.
   The sport has an honorable history: The ancient Egyptians kept
pigeons; Hannibal took them over the Alps; they served in both
world wars, carrying messages for the Allied intelligence forces in
Europe. Thirty-one pigeons were awarded the Dickens Medal, the
``Animal Victoria Cross,'' in World War II.
   In Britain, pigeons were traditionally associated with
beer-drinking, cloth-capped men, but it has moved upmarket in
recent years, attracting lawyers, actors and titans of industry. At
the top end of the scale, Queen Elizabeth II maintains a pigeon
loft.
   Britain's largest pigeon breeder, Louella Pigeon World, is a
high-tech enterprise that paid a world record 77,000 pounds
($120,120) in 1988 for the racing pigeon Emerald II.
   ``That, pound for pound, makes it more valuable than the Derby
winner,'' Camilleri said, referring to Britain's most prestigious
horse race.
   Emerald II is moved from one secret location to another, because
with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money,
sabotage and pigeon-napping are not unheard of.
   However, high prices don't always guarantee success, Camilleri
said, and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds ($32).
   ``Stockmanship comes into it, knowing and understanding
pigeons,'' he explained. ``They all have their individual
characters and what you've got to do is understand their character
well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next
pigeon.''
   No one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after
being released, sometimes hundreds of miles away.
   ``The sun is definitely one (factor) and magnetic field is
definitely a second,'' Camilleri said. Research in Europe indicates
the sense of smell also may help.
   There's also a very basic urge.
   Most pigeons in Britain are kept on the ``widowhood system.'' As
soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young, or squeakers,
they're separated. Only the males are raced, and the only time they
get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of
a race.
   Each fancier's loft is registered and the distance between it
and any of the 200 official British ``liberation sites'' measured
to the nearest yard.
   Pigeons are bundled into baskets, sometimes the night before a
race, and taken to the liberation site in air-conditioned trucks.
Each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its
leg with the details of where it came from.
   The pigeons are all released at the same time. They ascend
rapidly, quickly become oriented and head for home.
   When they land, the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it
in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club.
The flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who
won the race.
   What is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty?
   ``The fascination about it: you get a few pigeons, you start
winning races, and from then on it's a lot like horse racing, only
cheaper,'' Camilleri said.
   ``You can pit your wits against nature.''

   Three years ago, a friend talked to Constantin
Costa-Gavras about a project concerning Nazis permitted to emigrate
to the United States after World War II.
   The director, who makes films about issues _ Greek political
assassination in ``Z,'' Chilean government brutality and American
compliance in ``Missing,'' white extremists in ``Betrayed'' _ was
immediately interested. He read books on the subject and developed
the idea for his new film, ``Music Box,'' in which a lawyer
(Jessica Lange) defends her Hungarian father against accusations of
atrocities committed during the war.
   ``Essentially, I like to do something which has never been made
or said before,'' the Greek director explained in a recent
interview. ``It's the best way for me to do a movie, to deal with a
very original subject.
   ``We in Europe used to think most of the war criminals went to
Latin America. When I was in Chile they showed me places, `Here,'
`Here,' `There,' where Nazis lived. Paraguay also. In America, it
was quite secret for the general population.''
   Memories of the Holocaust also haunt ``Enemies: A Love Story,''
Paul Mazursky's new film. The director started with Isaac Beshavis
Singer's novel and filled in his own memories of growing up in the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn during the 1940s.
   Ron Silver stars as Herman Broder, a Polish Jew who hid from the
Nazis during the war and now lives in Brooklyn.
   He is torn among his current wife, Yadwiga (Margaret Sophie
Stein), a Polish peasant who took care of him while he hid from the
Nazis; Masha (Lena Olin), a fellow survivor with whom he's having a
passionate affair; and his first wife, Tamara (Angelica Huston),
who has returned after supposedly being murdered by the Nazis.
   Mazursky, like Singer _ and Costa-Gavras _ was never in the
Holocaust. But ``Enemies'' is simply a story, based on second-hand
knowledge and a first-rate imagination, the director insisted.
   ``Isaac spoke to many survivors, I'm sure, who must have flooded
the streets of New York,'' said Mazursky, who also has directed
``Harry and Tonto,'' ``An Unmarried Woman'' and ``Down and Out in
Beverly Hills.''
   ``He probably got the story from talking to more than one
survivor, so that people like Masha and her mother and Herman and
the person who hid him in the barn _ those are stories he probably
heard and made this tale up.
   ``I met many survivors, had dinner, conversations, whatever. All
that I had gotten I gave to the actors while we rehearsed. I had
them meet with some of these people, in Los Angeles and in New
York.''
   For ``Music Box,'' Costa-Gavras began with non-fiction and built
a story around it.
   In both films, the Holocaust is always present but never on
screen, unlike the recently released ``Triumph of the Spirit.'' For
Mazursky and Costa-Gavras, the subject seemed too large for even
the most learned observer.
   Singer himself wrote: ``From his (Herman's) own experience with
Masha and other survivors of the German camps, he knew that the
whole truth would never be learned from those who had survived the
concentration camps or the wandering through Russia _ not because
they lied but because it was impossible for them to tell it all.''
   So Mazursky deferred to documentaries such as ``Shoah'' and
``Hotel Terminus'' as more appropriate ways to learn directly about
that tragedy. Once research was completed, he concentrated on the
actual film.
   Costa-Gavras agreed, saying he deliberately confined ``Music
Box'' to the present.
   ``You run the risk of being eaten by the story. In `Music Box,'
there's no particular action, no landscape. It's a very empty
movie. It takes place in the present, but with people speaking
about the past. How you deal with the past, that's the challenge.''
   With such explosive material, it is important to have actors
with whom the audience will be comfortable. But balance is
necessary; the story always comes first. As Costa-Gavras noted,
``Music Box'' is not a ``Jessica Lange'' film, any more than
``Missing'' is a ``Sissy Spacek'' film or ``Betrayed'' a ``Debra
Winger'' film.
   ``It's not only being known, it's being a good actor,'' he said.
``You're a good actor and you get known. That's the case with Sissy
or Debra or Jack Lemmon and now Jessica Lange. You can spoil the
story with a big actor.
   ``We're far away from the actors of the '40s and the '50s. Gary
Cooper, Errol Flynn. This is over, those kind of mythical stars.
Now we go to see an actor playing a character, a real character.
Jessica made her character real.''
   Mazursky praised Silver, acclaimed for his performance on stage
in ``Speed-the-Plow,'' and said the actor was ideal for playing ``a
Herman.''
   ``A Herman is somebody who comes from Europe, whose father was a
rabbi, who's a scholar, an intellectual, who loves women, who's
very bright, ironic, and who's sad,'' the director explained.
   ``Ron can play that. Certain other actors, a lot of them don't
have all those qualities. They'd have to find them. I'm better off
finding someone who already has them.''
   ``Music Box'' ends with Lange, shattered by what she has learned
about her father, embracing her son in back of their lakefront
house. With her own innocence gone forever, she can only pass on
her knowledge and help her son adjust.
   ``The theme is about memory,'' Costa-Gavras said. ``Of course,
the memory goes with the future. She does what she does to save her
son, to have her son thinking differently and acting differently.
To learn how to live with this.''
   Mazursky adds his own touch at the end of the film, dissolving
from a closeup of Yadwiga's baby to a shot of the Coney Island
``Wonder Wheel,'' which can be viewed from Herman's window. The
message is bittersweet: Wounds eventually heal, a new generation is
born. But also, the lessons of the Holocaust may be forgotten.
   ``Out of the baby comes this image of the wheel,'' Mazursky
said, ``and all through the movie Herman has focused on the wheel
in his most contemplative and meditative moments, when he's
thinking about God knows what.
   ``The wheel keeps turning, life goes on. The baby is life and
life is mysterious. There's man and there's woman, it never ends.
Even the Holocaust is absorbed into that circle and the life will
go on.''

<HEAD>A Long Dry Spell for Small Stocks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``Think big'' has been much more than just a
slogan in Wall Street's bull market of the 1980s.
   Big deals in big stocks have engendered many a big profit. But
there wasn't much left over for investors in many newer, smaller
companies known collectively in the financial world as secondary
stocks.
   So on the verge of the '90s, while owners of blue chips are
wondering whether the market can keep on rising, fans of small
stocks are asking a more plaintive question: Is their turn ever
going to come?
   Historically, investors who take a chance on smaller stocks have
been rewarded with better returns, on average, than those who opted
for the presumed safety and stability of household-name companies.
   Wright Investors' Service, a Bridgeport, Conn., investment
management firm, says that sine 1950 small stocks have averaged a
total annual return (capital gains plus dividends) 2.5 percentage
points higher than their bigger counterparts, as represented by
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index.
   When the market began its long advance in the late summer of
1982, that pattern seemed to be holding. So-called ``junior
growth'' stocks in technology and other businesses scored some of
the standout gains in the first year of the bull market.
   But around June 1983 they abruptly stalled, and have failed to
catch up.
   ``During the last 6{ years, investor indifference to small-cap
stocks has been virtually unrelenting,'' Wright analysts observed
in a recent report.
   Since mid-1983, they noted, the S&amp;P 500 has been rolling up an
annual return of better than 15 percent a year. Over the same span,
the Value Line composite index of nearly 1,700 stocks _ which gives
greater weight to a broad array of smaller issues _ has posted an
average annual gain of 6.9 percent.
   That showing failed even to match the 7.2 percent annual return
produced by three-month Treasury bills, which are considered about
the safest, most conservative paper investment available.
   So investors effectively got paid nothing for taking the
considerable risks that come with smaller stocks.
   Many reasons have been cited for this seeming anomaly, including
the predominant influence in the market of investing institutions
and foreign investors. Both those groups have a notorious
predilection for big-name stocks with large numbers of shares
outstanding and high visibility in the marketplace.
   At the same time, individual investors, who represent a primary
constituency of the smaller companies, have been shunning
investments in individual stocks, opting instead for mutual funds
or other choices far removed from the stock market.
   It is axiomatic on Wall Street that no trend lasts forever, and
this one has gone on for a long time. Small stocks are now ``priced
at attractive levels compared to the major market averages,''
Wright says.
   Despite their subpar showing in recent years, the firm
maintains, small companies still hold an edge over bigger ones in
their growth potential, since they start from a smaller base and
often are run in a more youthful, venturesome spirit.
   If a bear market develops, Wright cautions, it is quite
conceivable that neither big nor small stocks will be spared. But
the firm concludes that high-quality ``junior blue chips'' are in
good position to beat, rather than trail, the big-name stocks over
the next five years.

   It begins with a male actor recounting a
romantic date _ dinner by candlelight, conversation by the
fireplace.
   ``Finally, we kissed,'' the actor says. ``Then he asked if I
enjoyed safer sex. I have never felt so good about saying yes.''
   The city unveiled the 30-second television spot, which ends with
the line ``rubber up for safety,'' with much fanfare last summer as
part of its latest AIDS education campaign.
   Months later, viewers of late-night programming on a local cable
channel are about the only ones who have seen it.
   To avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the surgeon
general recommended that people learn how the disease is
transmitted and how it can be prevented through use of condoms.
   The sloganeering has changed from ``safe sex'' to ``safer sex,''
acknowledging that no sex practice, including condoms, offers
fool-proof protection against AIDS.
   But getting the message to some of the people most at risk, such
as homosexual men or inner-city youths, without offending the
masses is difficult at best, say the people charged with creating
the ads.
   Critics of explicit AIDS education campaigns warn they could
backfire on health professionals and erode public support.
   ``I think they're turning people off,'' said Dr. Elizabeth M.
Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health, a
consortium of more than 200 physicians and scientists active in
consumer education.
   Reed V. Tuckson, the public health commissioner in Washington,
D.C., announced in 1987 that he wanted a sophisticated multimedia
campaign similar to those that ``sell Nike tennis shoes to poor
black youths.''
   The department then argued with city officials and community
groups for more than a year over wording on posters; it negotiated
with local news outlets and the public transit system, which would
not display placards with the word ``condom.''
   ``I did not anticipate ... significant opposition at so many
different levels,'' Tuckson said.
   Reaction was negative in some Boston quarters when a social
service group, Action for Boston Community Development, unveiled
its AIDS poster. It shows four young men, three with hats and one
holding a condom over his head, with the caption ``Be cool. Wear
your jimmy hat.''
   The group received complaints that by using the term ``jimmy
hat'' _ slang for condom and also the title of a rap music hit _
the posters spoke specifically to young people and encouraged them
to have sex.
   ``People who are dying of AIDS and are in their 20s obviously
contracted the disease while in their teens,'' Laura Palmer, an
ABCD spokeswoman, said in reaction.
   Nevertheless, the posters, ready in March, didn't make it onto
city buses and subways until June, held up by Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority review.
   New York's ``rubber up for safety'' campaign includes two
television spots, the one so widely rejected and a second ad that
features a talking head: Health Commissioner Stephen Joseph. Two
television stations, including the local CBS affiliate, have aired
the Joseph spot.
   Nancy Davies, vice president at Capriello &amp; Chabrowe, the agency
that designed the campaign, said her people went back and forth
with local TV stations on the more controversial ad, changing it
each time, but the stations still said no.
   ``They wouldn't have anything to do with them,'' she said.
   The city's newspapers have refused to run the campaign's print
ads, but they have shown up in subway cars and on station
billboards. One uses the headline ``Man-to-Man,'' with the letter
``o'' represented by a rolled-up condom.
   Part of the goal, Davies said, was to reach men who engage in
sex with other men but do not consider themselves part of the gay
community and thus do not frequent bars or organizations where they
would see other AIDS education messages.
   ``The bulk of the campaign, when it comes right down to it, is
in the subway,'' said Davies.
   Whelan of the American Council on Science and Health said she
objected to advocating condom use not for moral or ``prudish''
reasons, but because condoms are not 100 percent failsafe even when
used correctly.
   In addition, she said, the ads appear to condone, at least
unintentionally, homosexuality or sex outside a monogamous
relationship, behavior that many people oppose.
   ``If they're meant for homosexual men, I think they should be
targeted at them and not at everybody else,'' she said. ``I think
you end up turning people off and making them less sympathetic.''
   As head of the National AIDS Information and Education Program
at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Dr. Fred Kroger is
responsible for creating AIDS education materials for the public.
   The first campaign in 1987 offered promotions on the use of
condoms for sexually active people.
   ``In general those were not played by anybody,'' he said.
   Kroger said he had since refocused the message of the TV ads,
avoiding the word ``condom'' but including a telephone number
people can call for information.
   ``Rather than putting lots of money into messages that would not
be seen by anybody, we opted to do less explicit messages,'' he
said.
   Public health officials and the ad agencies say they realize
their work is controversial and they take pains not to be
``unnecessarily provocative.''
   But Tuckson, the District of Columbia health commissioner, says
he feels they have a responsibility to get information on reducing
the risk of AIDS to the people who need it.
   ``This is a society that advertises feminine hygiene deodorant
spray and depicts explicit sexual behavior in prime time,'' he
said. ``What is offensive and insulting is not to give people
information that can help save their lives.''

   For 12 months, police have doggedly sought the
bombers of Pan Am Flight 103 but said little officially about the
progress of their international manhunt.
   Here's what they have confirmed and what news reports have said
following the explosion and crash that killed all 259 people on the
plane and 11 on the ground last Dec. 21:
   _One week after the disaster, Britain's Department of Transport
confirmed a bomb blew up the Boeing 747 and said investigators had
found evidence of a powerful plastic explosive.
   _In February, Scottish police said the bomb was planted in a
Toshiba radio-cassette player and probably checked in as hold
baggage in Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated.
West German police had seized similar bombs in October 1988 and
arrested 16 Palestinians. All but two were soon released, including
Marwan Khreesat, who some people believe assembled the bomb in
Frankfurt.
   _News reports have frequently pointed to the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a radical Palestinian
group based in Syria, as the leading suspect. The group's leader,
Ahmed Jibril, repeatedly has denied involvement but has also
reportedly boasted he was paid by Iran to avenge the downing of an
Iranian airliner by a U.S. warship. Hafez Dalkamoni, one of
Jibril's top aides, is one of the two suspects still held in West
Germany.
   _Some news reports said the bomb was smuggled to Malta, checked
onto an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt and transferred to Pan Am
without an accompanying passenger. Others say the bomb began its
journey in Larnaca, Cyprus, in a suitcase switched with one
belonging to U.S. intelligence officers returning home after
looking for American hostages in Lebanon.
   _A court in Uppsala, Sweden, last month identified Mohammed Abu
Talb, a member of the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, another
radical faction, as a suspect in the Flight 103 bombing. Scottish
police were permitted to remove clothing from his Sweden apartment,
reportedly to compare with shreds of clothing found in the
wreckage. Abu Talb is awaiting verdicts, due Dec. 21, on charges of
murder and attempted murder in connection with four bombings in
northern Europe. Court documents show he was in Malta in October
1988.
   _U.S. Rep. James Traficant Jr. of Ohio released portions of a
report, said to have been prepared for Pan Am's insurance
underwriters, that alleges the terrorists got the bomb aboard the
plane through a CIA-protected drug smuggling ring at Frankfurt
airport. The CIA called the allegations nonsense.
   _On Friday, Scotland's chief law officer said an inquest would
be held next year but said criminal proceedings were not imminent.
He said the inquiry ``would not be likely'' to hear foreign
evidence but its scope would include whether ``reasonable
precautions'' might have avoided the bombing and possible
``defects'' in any system that might have contributed to the deaths.

<HEAD>Some Think Farmers Soon Will Be Panting for 1990 Drought Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the 1990 wheat crop is already suffering,
can calls for federal drought aid be far behind? Probably not,
government officials say.
   A weekly weather and crop bulletin by the departments of
Agriculture and Commerce said winter wheat was in ``fair to good''
condition across the country, although Russian wheat aphids were at
work in some areas.
   ``The Great Plains remained dry'' the week of Dec. 4-10, the
report said. ``Snow provided some needed moisture and reduced
insect activity in the central and northern Great Plains.''
   But farmers in Kansas and other plains states are looking at the
possibility of drought for the third straight year. Winter wheat
farmers, particularly, are concerned for the crop they planted this
fall and will harvest next summer.
   Collectively, farmers were paid $3.9 billion in federal aid for
1988 drought losses and stand to get $897 million under 1989
provisions. As of Nov. 30, about $319.7 million had been paid out
for this year's losses.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., was asked last month about the
possibility of Congress being asked again for disaster aid if
winter wheat faltered because of drought.
   ``I would guess if there is another disaster, we're going to
respond,'' Dole said. ``Now it looks like if we don't get some
moisture fairly soon, it's going to be a repeat performance.''
   Dole acknowledged that many in Congress, including himself, want
farmers to start relying on federal crop insurance to take care of
bad harvests, but he said that won't happen until lawmakers improve
the program.
   ``Every year we make these statements, `No more disaster aid.
It's going to be crop insurance.' We haven't reached that point
yet,'' said Dole. ``It may come up in the farm bill next year.''
   Last week at the National Press Club, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter was asked about Dole's comments. Kansas
historically is the No. 1 wheat producer.
   ``If drought conditions persist, Congress will inevitably look
at drought aid. That is as _ you can bank that as easily as death
and taxes _ assuredly so,'' Yeutter said. ``And it's unfortunate
that dry conditions do persist once again out in the winter wheat
producing areas.''
   Congress is in the midst of writing a new farm bill to replace
the 1985 law that expires next year. Yeutter said the whole
question of crop insurance and ``so-called ad hoc disaster
assistance programs'' should be reviewed.
   It was said that disaster aid for farmers in 1988 was hastened
by it being a presidential election year. But there were no
national elections this year, when a scaled-down relief measure was
adopted.
   Although the number of farmers continues its long-term decline,
farmers and their organizations retain considerable clout on
Capitol Hill. Whether that can translate into political advantage
for one party or the other is open to question.
   Harry Truman put it on the line with farmers July 15, 1948, when
he accepted his party's presidential nomination in Philadelphia.
   ``Confidence and security have been brought to the people by the
Democratic Party,'' Truman said. ``Farm income has increased from
less than $2.5 billion in 1932 to more than $18 billion in 1947.''
   Truman added: ``Never in the world were the farmers of any
republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the
farmers of the United States, and if they don't do their duty by
the Democratic Party they are the most ungrateful people in the
world.''
   Some time after his stunning win against the GOP's Thomas Dewey
that fall, Truman noted that he lost four Southern states to
``Dixiecrats'' but carried 13 of the biggest urban states and seven
major farm states _ Missouri, California, Iowa, Illinois, Texas,
Minnesota and Wisconsin.

   The delinquency rate for home mortgages jumped
sharply to the highest level in more than two years in the
July-September quarter, a trade association said.
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America said Thursday that
5.00 percent of mortgage payments for one-to-four family residences
were 30 or more days late, up from a second-quarter rate of 4.52
percent, a 10-year low.
   It was the highest delinquency rate since the second quarter of
1987, when 5.02 percent of mortgages were past due.
   A jump in late mortgage payments often reflects economic
difficulties among consumers, but Warren Lasko, Mortgage Bankers
executive vice president, said the association found no ready
explanation for the increase.
   Although economic growth has slowed, the unemployment rate has
remained relatively stable, close to 15-year lows, and Americans'
disposable personal income grew during the period, he said.
   Historically, the rate sometimes jumps in one quarter only to
decline in the next, he cautioned.
   Lasko noted that the foreclosure rate in the third quarter
declined from 1.06 percent to 0.99 percent. Also, the percentages
of loans more than 60 days and more than 90 days past due increased
only slightly.
   By region, the 30-day delinquency rate in the Northeast was 4.34
percent in the third quarter, up from 3.74 percent; in the North
Central states, 5.13 percent, up from 4.36 percent; in the South,
5.53 percent, up from 4.87 percent, and in the West, 4.08 percent,
up from 3.64 percent.
   The mortgage survey covers 13 million loans representing $597
billion in debt, about one-third of all mortgage loans in the
United States.

<HEAD>Struggling Brokerage Sets $900 Million Recapitalization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $900 million recapitalization plan preserves
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s credit rating at a time of weak
profits and layoffs at Wall Street's second-largest brokerage.
   The deal, announced Thursday, also reduces parent American
Express Co.'s stake to under 50 percent and excludes investor and
Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman, who was in talks for a minority
share in exchange for a large investment.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. confirmed Shearson's senior debt
ratings after the plan was disclosed, removing a major threat to
Shearson's reputation and financial stability. Securities firms
need good credit to borrow money for large transactions.
   Moody's said the recapitalization plan ``will materially
increase Shearson's tangible net worth.''
   ``Continuing efforts to reduce expenses should help boost
Shearson's performance,'' Moody's said in a statement. ``However,
intensifying competition in the global securities business and a
difficult operating environment will remain constraints.''
   The recapitalization includes the issue of 20 million new shares
of Shearson common stock, which would raise $295 million if sold at
Thursday's New York Stock Exchange closing price of $14.75 a share.
   American Express, which bought its Shearson stake in 1981, would
buy 3 million shares of the new issue, pumping about $44 million
into Shearson. The travel, credit card and financial services
company also plans to purchase Shearson cumulative preferred stock
with a liquidation value of $250 million.
   In addition, $300 million in capital would be raised through two
equal stock placements with large institutional investors. Finally,
American Express would buy Ayco Corp., a Shearson financial
counseling subsidiary, for $56 million, bringing the total new
capital to $901 million.
   The institutional investors were not named, but Wall Street
sources said discussions were held to give a minority stake in
Shearson to Perelman.
   ``There were talks. They were preliminary. It really didn't come
to terms,'' one source said.
   The sources, who asked not to be named, said American Express
had not finalized the outside investors, but they said there would
be a number of them.
   The recapitalization is expected to shore up Shearson's balance
sheet but is not expected to guarantee a turnaround during a time
of slumping profits and slow business on Wall Street.
   The plan would achieve American Express' long-desired goal of
reducing its stake in Shearson to under 50 percent from 61 percent
to remove the brokerage's up-and-down performance from its earnings
report.
   Moody's on Oct. 30 said it was considering downgrading
Shearson's ratings on $4.8 billion in bonds and commercial paper
because of the firm's low capital, weak profits and exposure in
commercial real estate loans and investments, as well as the
overall securities industry slump.
   Shearson stock has fallen in recent months because of poor
earnings. The firm recently began laying off 800 workers to reduce
its size to 35,700 employees, reshuffling its senior management and
slashing stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years.
   The boards of directors of American Express and Shearson
approved the recapitalization plan late Thursday.
   Under the plan, American Express will remain the largest
shareholder in Shearson. Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan,
currently the second-largest shareholder with 13 percent, would
remain in that position, although its new stake would be smaller.
   American Express said it expects to record a one-time charge to
net income reflecting the difference between the value of Shearson
on its books and the value of its holdings based on the share
price. The charge would total $60 million at Thursday's share
price, American Express said.
   Officials said Shearson was willing to part with Albany-based
Ayco, which provides financial planning services to corporate
executives, because it fits more with American Express' operations.
   American Express said it planned to file registration statements
with the Securities and Exchange Commission early next week on the
recapitalization.

<HEAD>Gonzalez Pledges to Reform Fed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee chairman says he
will begin an effort to change the Federal Reserve Board, saying
the ``splendid isolation'' of the central bank ``won't continue
forever.''
   ``I recognize the need to give the Federal Reserve room to
operate and make objective judgments,'' said Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, a longtime critic of the Fed.
   ``But, this doesn't have to mean ... (it) operates as some
separate government, free to veto economic policy spelled out by
the administration, the Congress _ and the American people at the
voting booths,'' he said Thursday.
   On another matter, Gonzalez prodded President Bush to
re-evaluate the administration's ``Pollyannaish'' view that a $50
billion savings and loan bailout is sufficient.
   Bush suggested earlier this week that the $50 billion the
government is borrowing to close S&amp;Ls through September 1991 may
fall short. However, a day later, his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater,
backtracked, saying the president had no plans to ask Congress for
more money.
   Gonzalez, in a speech to the Consumer Federation of America,
offered few specifics on how he would restructure the Fed, but
afterward mentioned expanding the board to include representatives
of interests other than banking. Consumers, builders, manufacturers
and other groups hurt by high interest rates have long sought more
influence over Fed policy.
   The seven Fed board members in Washington are appointed to
14-year terms by the president and once in office cannot be
removed. The boards of the 12 regional banks that comprise the
Federal Reserve System are dominated by members chosen by bankers.
   Gonzalez, through most of his 28-year career in Congress, has
been frequently critical of the central bank for fighting inflation
at the expense of economic growth. When interest rates soared in
the early 1980s, he introduced legislation to impeach Paul Volcker,
then Fed chairman.
   A bill introduced this year by Reps. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., and
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., would force the Fed to announce the results
of closed-door sessions immediately rather than with the current
six-week lag. It also would require it to meet regularly with
administration officials.
   However, Gonzalez said the approach was ``fragmentary'' and that
he would launch a long-term effort to comprehensively restructure
the Fed, starting with hearings and studies next year and
legislation after that.
   ``The splendid isolation of the Federal Reserve won't continue
forever,'' he said.
   Gonzalez's effort may get some sympathy with the Bush
administration, which has complained periodically about the Fed's
tight-money policy. Housing Secretary Jack Kemp has suggested that
administration officials should have more influence over monetary
policy.
   However, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and the panel's senior Republican, Jake Garn
of Utah, have said they would oppose any attempt to weaken the
Fed's independence.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the central bank's
independence serves the country well by giving it the ability to
make unpopular decisions that benefit the economy in the long run.
   Gonzalez has maintained for nearly a year that more money was
needed for savings and loans. He invited Bush ``to look very
closely at the situation and to start running those computers
overtime.''
   ``Bad news may go down a lot better in January than next October
with the crisis once again at five minutes to midnight,'' he said.

   Suppliers to department stores owned by
financially distressed Campeau Corp. are taking a cautious approach
regarding future merchandise shipments.
   One of the companies that act as middlemen between manufacturers
and retailers, known as factors, said Thursday it no longer would
extend credit on goods bound for Campeau's stores.
   Meanwhile, several apparel and accessory manufacturers said they
were keeping in close touch with executives in charge of Campeau's
U.S. retailing operations. Bills have been paid on time so far,
they said.
   The suppliers, whose fates are tied to retailers, expressed hope
that business wouldn't be disrupted as Campeau copes with a
worsening cash shortage.
   ``I'm very worried about the situation,'' said Howard Bloom,
president and chief executive of Chetta B Inc., a clothing maker.
``It gets progressively worse looking every day. I'm taking a
wait-and-see posture.''
   Retail analysts said disclosures by Campeau's Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. of deepening
financial difficulties were unsurprising given the fierce
competition in the industry.
   Federated and Allied said in documents submitted to the
Securities and Exchange Commission that their cash could run out by
March or sooner and that they might seek protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   The move would permit Campeau-owned retailers to remain
operating while their Canadian parent company sorted out its
financial problems. At the heart of the trouble is the massive debt
Campeau acquired in taking over Federated in 1988 for $6.7 billion
and Allied in 1986 for $3.4 billion.
   A threatened inability to meet interest payments on junk bonds
sold to pay for the acquisitions forced the Toronto-based retail
and real estate company to turn to outsiders for help earlier this
year.
   Canada's Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. came to the rescue
with a $250 million loan to Campeau. As part of a deal for an
additional $800 million next year from Olympia &amp; York, Campeau put
the Bloomingdale's department store chain up for sale in September.
About a half dozen bidders are evaluating the chain and Campeau has
said a final sale could be arranged by February.
   In the SEC filings, made public Wednesday, Federated and Allied
said bankruptcy court protection would be an alternative if lenders
won't ease repayment terms. Federated owes creditors $1.15 billion
by the end of April and Allied faces debts of $633.7 million due by
the end of March.
   Failing a rescheduling of the payments, Campeau said it would
consider selling additional holdings, raising money by taking out
mortgages on its stores or possibly seeking bankruptcy-court
protection.
   In addition to the 17-store Bloomingdale's chain, Federated
operates Abraham &amp; Straus, Burdines, Lazarus, Rich's and
Goldsmith's. Under the Allied umbrella are The Bon Marche, Jordan
Marsh, Maas Brothers and Stern's. Combined, the two have about
100,000 employees and 260 stores.
   Vendors, such as clothing makers Bernard Chaus Inc., Ellen Tracy
Inc., Liz Claiborne Inc., that do business with many of the stores
said they would continue to monitor developments at Campeau and
that up to now they've been satisfied with how promptly the company
has paid for goods.
   Another yardstick of Campeau's relationship with vendors could
come when some manufacturers seek credit in coming weeks to ship
spring merchandise to the stores.
   Bernard Chaus, chairman and chief executive officer of the
ready-to-wear clothing company that bears his name, said: ``We
certainly are going to support them on all fronts.'' Chaus added,
however, that he assumes Federated and Allied stores would ``have
some major problems with merchandise shipments.''
   Chaus doesn't use factoring, which involves companies buying
accounts receivable and taking over the job of collecting the money
due.
   The second-largest factor in the country, Chicago-based Heller
Financial Inc., shut off credit lines to Campeau suppliers as of
Thursday morning, spokeswoman Laura Jiracek said.
   CIT Group-Factoring Manufacturers Hanover Inc., the biggest in
the business, said it was continuing to assess the situation.
Francis X. Basile, chairman of the CIT unit, said he was concerned
there might be an undue reaction in the retail community.
   He said the only new development was Campeau's public
acknowledgement that bankruptcy-court protection might be
necessary. Basile said in an interview that outsiders have thought
all along that was a possibility.
   But, he noted, ``There's a lot of things that we're going to
have to resolve before we can approve any future orders.''

<HEAD>Founder of Company at Heart of Scandal Denies Bribery Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hiromasa Ezoe, whose Recruit Co. gave its name to a
scandal that brought down a government and tarnished the Japanese
establishment, said in court today that he did not bribe
politicians and public officials.
   Also denying bribery charges were Toshiro Ono, an executive of
Recruit, an information conglomerate, and two politicians: Takao
Fujinami, a former Cabinet minister, and Katsuya Ikeda of the
opposition Komeito (Clean Government) party.
   If convicted, the defendants could be sentenced to five years in
prison.
   Their trial is the last of five, which began Nov. 22 in Tokyo
District Court and will last for months as the legal system delves
into allegations of corruption in in the cozy relationship between
Japanese government and business.
   The Recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned last spring after
acknowledging he received large donations from Recruit.
   Other key figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party have
been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking
bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from
Recruit.
   Ezoe, 53, told Judge Tadatsugu Watanabe today he accepted the
prosecution's allegations that he provided gifts and bargain-priced
shares of stock to influential figures. But he said they weren't
intended as bribes.
   ``These events did occur, but I do not agree with the substance
of the charges,'' Ezoe said. ``I had absolutely no intention of
committing bribery. ... I apologize for causing social disorder.''
   Like the other three defendants, Ezoe accused prosecutors of
mistreating him.
   ``The prosecutors questioned me from morning to night. When I
tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the
point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing,'' he said.
   Fujinami, 56, was chief Cabinet secretary under Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, Takeshita's predecessor. He is accused of
receiving the equivalent of $140,000 and 10,000 shares in
Recruit-Cosmos, a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential
people at a reduced price before it was sold publicly.
   Prosecutors say he put pressure on the Labor Ministry not to
change the traditional season for recruiting college graduates,
which would have hurt Recruit's sales of job-placement magazines.
Fujinami denied the allegations.
   Fujinami said he had been unaware of both the political
donations from Recruit and the share-dealing, which was done by an
aide.
   Ikeda, 52, is charged with receiving $14,000 for himself,
$35,000 for his wife and 5,000 shares in Recruit-Cosmos for his
brother.
   According to prosecutors, he gave pro-Recruit speeches in
Parliament in return. Ikeda resigned his seat; Fujinami remained in
Parliament, but resigned from his party.
   Ono, a 39-year-old former company department head who faces two
counts of giving bribes, denied the allegation.
   The other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other Recruit
executives.
   Prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe.
Japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or
politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the
official is in a position to supervise.
   Recruit offered millions of discount shares in Recruit-Cosmos to
hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen before the
stock was available to the general public.
   When it was offered on the over-the-counter market, the price of
the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits. Fujinami's
shares were said to have gained him $215,000.
   On Wednesday, the former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Corp., Hisashi Shinto, 79, acknowledged he made about
$145,000 in 1986 on Recruit-Cosmos shares he bought before the
issue went public, but denied favoring Recruit with special
treatment when it entered the telecommunications market.
   ``I accepted the offer of shares, but I never regarded it as a
bribe,'' he said. ``Rejecting such an offer is considered rude in
Japan.''
   Defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal between
businesses and the powerful bureaucracy in Japan, where an entire
industry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts to
cement personal and business ties.
   Businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specific
favors but at establishing relationships with business associates,
supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to do
business with them.

<TEXT>
   Robert McKinney, the former owner of The
Santa Fe New Mexican, regained control of it Thursday from Gannett
Co. Inc., less than one month after going to court to block
Gannett's attempt to sell the newspaper.
   Thursday's purchase by McKinney and his daughter, Robin McKinney
Martin, ended a nearly 14-year association McKinney had with
Arlington, Va.-based Gannett, including a bitter nine-year legal
battle over day-to-day control of the newspaper. McKinney sold the
daily newspaper to Gannett in 1976.
   Douglas H. McCorkindale, vice chairman and chief financial and
administrative officer for Gannett, told a meeting of security
analysts in New York City on Thursday the transaction value was in
the mid-$30 million range.
   Sheila Gibbons, Gannett's public affairs director, said the
newspaper group decided to sell The New Mexican because ``we felt
this was a good idea. I can't comment beyond that.''
   Neither McKinney of Santa Fe and Middleburg, Va., nor Martin of
Santa Fe, owner of the weekly Taos News in northern New Mexico,
returned telephone calls to The Associated Press seeking comment on
the purchase.
   McKinney, in a question-and-answer piece scheduled to appear in
Friday's editions, said, his relationship with Gannett ``has been
long and stormy.
   ``In the course of the current negotiations, Gannett's conduct
has been proper in my opinion and I think that Gannett would say
that my conduct has been equally proper,'' McKinney wrote. ``I
think, however, that both of us will now be happier going our own
separate ways.''
   Among the reasons for buying back the publication, he added, was
``I did not want to see the New Mexican owned by or sold again to
another chain operation.''
   Gannett agreed in September to sell The New Mexican to Donrey
Media Group of Fort Smith, Ark., in a deal valued at $35 million,
according to court records filed in a lawsuit brought by McKinney
to block the sale.
   Gannett said in court documents it terminated the agreement with
Donrey after McKinney filed a complaint alleging that Gannett had
violated an employment agreement with him.
   The employment agreement, under which McKinney remained the
newspaper's publisher for five years and editor-in-chief for 10
years, was part of the transaction in which McKinney sold The New
Mexican to Gannett in February 1976.
   McKinney alleged Gannett failed to honor a stipulation that if
Gannett wanted to sell the paper it would have to give McKinney the
opportunity to purchase it first by matching terms of the
prospective buyer's offer.
   Gannett, in a counterclaim, denied McKinney's accusations and
alleged ``bad faith'' by McKinney to manipulate his right to refuse
an agreement to sell the paper.
   State District Judge Steve Herrera said he signed a
one-paragraph order Thursday dismissing McKinney's complaint as
well as a counterclaim filed by Gannett at the request of both
parties because the issues in the case had been settled.
   The purchase of The New Mexican, which said it has a daily
circulation of 20,088 and a Sunday circulation of 21,189, involved
the transfer of 800,000 shares of Gannett stock by McKinney and
Martin to Gannett.
   Gannett said in a news release the shares were being transferred
in a tax-free exchange for the stock of The New Mexican.
   McKinney, who first bought the newspaper in 1949, was quoted in
a New Mexican story announcing the sale as saying department heads,
managers and staff members would continue in their present
positions.
   Sale of the newspaper leaves Gannett with 82 daily newspapers,
including USA Today.

<HEAD>Affiliated Sees 1989 Profit Decline; Other Media Companies Expect
Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Affiliated Publications Inc., publisher of The
Boston Globe, expects lower earnings from continuing operations
this year, but four other media companies indicated they will post
profit increases.
   Gannett Co. Inc., Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., Washington Post Co. and
McClatchy Newspapers Inc. each told securities analysts at
PaineWebber Inc.'s annual media outlook conference Thursday that
their earnings will be up this year.
   Boston-based Affiliated stated that it expected earnings per
share from continuing operations for 1989 will be 61 cents to 64
cents, down from 75 cents a share in 1988.
   Affiliated Chairman William O. Taylor said he expects the
company will do ``a little better next year'' as the decline in
advertising volume levels off, costs of newsprint remain low,
previous efforts to cut costs show results and the Globe introduces
more zoned editions.
   Douglas McCorkindale, Gannett's vice chairman and chief
financial officer, said analysts who were estimating earnings per
share in the ``mid-$2.40 range are on the right track.'' Gannett,
based in Arlington, Va., earned $2.26 a share in 1988.
   Those results include a loss of ``a couple of million dollars''
at Gannett's national newspaper, USA Today, in contrast with a loss
of about $25 million a year earlier, according to USA Today
President Thomas Curley.
   He said his aim was to make the newspaper profitable for all of
1990.
   The company, which owns more than 80 daily newspapers as well as
television ands radio stations and an outdoor advertising company,
declined to estimate 1990 earnings.
   Dow Jones, based in New York, said it expects to report 1989
earnings per share of $3.13 to $3.18, up from $2.35 a share in 1988.
   The publisher of The Wall Street Journal said that excluding
non-recurring gains, its earnings will be off by about 4 percent to
$1.49 to $1.54 a share for the year from $1.65 a share a year
earlier.
   Those results have been depressed by losses connected with the
foreign exchange trading service operated by its Telerate unit and
retrenchments in the financial community that have led to sharp
declines in financial advertising volume, said Chairman Warren H.
Phillips.
   Washington Post, which has properties that include its namesake
flagship newspaper, Newsweek magazine, television stations and
cable TV operations, said it expects its earnings per share will
rise 20 percent to $15.50 from $12.90 on a pro forma basis in 1988.
It said its operating income will be up 33 percent.
   Richard D. Simmons, president, said 1990 should be a good year
although the company could not hope to reach the same level of
earnings growth as in 1989.
   McClatchy, based in Sacramento, Calif., and publisher of the
Sacramento Bee, Anchorage Daily News, Tacoma News Tribune and
others, expects to reach analysts' earnings estimates of $1.15 a
share to $1.20 a share this year, up from $1.02 a share in 1988,
said James P. Smith, vice president and treasurer.
   Smith declined to forecast 1990 earnings prospects other than to
say they should produce ``good but not spectacular results.''
   But he noted 1990 results will be depressed by 20 cents a share
due to the recent acquisitions of three daily and two weekly
newspapers in South Carolina and that McClatchy expects to have a
loss of $4.5 million to $5 million next year on its investment in
the startup of a newspaper mill in Washington state.

<HEAD>SEC, French Securities Watchdog Sign Cooperation Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and French securities regulators will be
exchanging more than pleasantries now that they've signed a new
mutual assistance agreement to investigate fraud and other market
abuses.
   Under the agreement, the SEC and its French equivalent _ the
Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) _ will assist each other
by providing information in their respective files, taking
statements from individuals and obtaining documents.
   Both agencies also agreed, in a separate document, to consult
each other ``about subjects of common interest in order to
coordinate market oversight and resolve differences that may
exist'' between the two countries' regualtory system.
   The agreement was signed Thursday in Paris by SEC Chairman
Richard C. Breeden and COB President Jean Saint-Geours.
   In prepared remarks for the signing, released by the SEC in
Washington, Breeden said the agreement provides ``a specific means
for the United States and French regulators to exchange information
for use in investigating securities laws violations.''
   The statement continued: ``Under the agreement, the SEC and COB
will use their own securities enforcement powers to the greatest
possible extent in providing mutual assistance. This will help us
to achieve greater stability and integrity in our markets.''
   U.S. investors' transactions in French corporate stock increased
from $1.2 billion in 1985 to $4 billion last year. During the same
period, French transactions in U.S. corporate stock doubled, from
$6 billion to $12 billion.
   Breeden noted that he reached a similar agreement Monday with
Dutch securitiees regulators.
   The statement added that the SEC has undertaken several moves
``designed to stimulate international capital formation and
cross-border activities of securities professionals.''
   They include a July regulation easing registration requirements
for foreign broker-dealers to conduct some activities in this
country; and a new proposal, Rule 144-A, that would facilitate the
sale of foreign securities in the private placement market without
normal U.S. registration procedures.
   ``Even as we eliminate barriers to international securities
transactions. we must be alert to the increased risks of
cross-border fraud,'' said Breeden, adding, ``the agreement signed
today strengthens our ability to prevent and detect these types of
unlawful activities conducted across national borders.''
   The agreement allows either U.S. or French securities officials
to take statements and testimony from individuals in their own
country and supply them to the other country's officials.
   Information supplied to the foreign authorities is to be
subject, in most cases, to the confidentiality rules of the
supplying country.
   Unlike the Dutch agreement, the new pact does not confine
applicability to French territory in Europe.
   The agreement, however, limits the exchange of information to
events that occurred after the pact goes into effect.

<HEAD>Xerox Suit Claims Apple Stole Pioneering Machintosh Software Design</HEAD>

   A $150 million federal lawsuit alleges
Apple Computer employees saw pioneering Xerox Corp. graphics
programs at a trade show in 1981 and pirated the design to create
the revolutionary Macintosh computer.
   The suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, also alleges
then-Apple President Steven Jobs saw a demonstration of another
Xerox program, Smalltalk, at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in
1979, and that he and other Apple employees were ``very impressed
with the unique and revolutionary user-friendly design.''
   Jobs was ousted from Apple in 1985 and founded Next Inc., which
makes workstation computers.
   ``Xerox never licensed Apple to use the Star computer program or
its distinctive graphics or its unique design and appearance or its
unique concept and feel,'' the suit said. It also claims Apple
gained unauthorized access by hiring several Xerox employees in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, including Star software developers.
   The suit, the first of its kind ever filed by Xerox, claims
Apple's now-defunct Lisa computer system and Macintosh Finder, both
copyrighted in 1987, were derived from the two Xerox programs.
Smalltalk was developed in the mid-1970s, and Star was copyrighted
in 1981.
   The lawsuit says Apple employees saw the Star program at the
trade show, in Houston in June 1981, and copied substantial
portions in its Lisa and Macintosh Finder programs, including the
design and appearance of the main application windows, dialogue
boxes and menu, and some of the exact icons, or symbols, used in
the program.
   Apple was granted a license in June 1981 to participate with
Xerox in a project to implement Smalltalk into a hardware system to
be developed by Apple, the suit said.
   Thomas C. Abbott, a spokesman for Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox,
said the civil suit was filed after efforts beginning a week ago to
reach an agreement were rebuffed by Apple.
   ``We sought a settlement with Apple and we resorted to these
legal means only when it became absolutely necessary,'' said Abbott.
   Officials of Apple, based in Cupertino, said Xerox's software
graphics concepts are not protected by copyright any more than
depictions of birds and trees are protected by the copyright on a
painting.
   ``We believe the case is without merits,'' said Apple
spokeswoman Carleen LeVasseur. ``The complaint confuses the
difference between ideas and expression; the copyright protects
expresssion, not ideas.''
   She said Apple has always recognized Xerox and others as
responsible for ideas, including computer graphics devices called
mirrors and windows.
   ``Copyright covers artistic expression but not the ideas. In
art, it does not cover the trees and birds in a picture, only the
picture ... what Apple has done is take those ideas and spend a lot
of money in research and development and make our own original
expression.''
   The suit, which asks for a jury trial, said the Star program
``is widely recognized in the computer industry as being the first
to introduce fanciful desktop workstation graphics to allow the
user to interact with the computer,'' a development that took Xerox
``millions of dollars and years of creative effort.''
   The suit claims a total of $50 million in damages from unfair
competition under state and federal laws, plus punitive damages
under state law of an unspecified amount. It also seeks at least
$100 million from Apple for unjust enrichment from licenses and
royalties for its products.
   Macintosh graphics replaced complicated word codes with simple
symbols, vastly streamlining the way users ranging from
schoolchildren to office workers select programs, issue commands
and perform other functions.
   In a similar suit, Apple sued Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard Co.
in the same court in March 1988, claiming infringement of Lisa and
the Macintosh Finder copyrights, among others, and alleging both
were original to Apple.
   Apple claimed that Microsoft's Windows 2.03 and a
Hewlett-Packard program called NewWave, which is based on it, too
closely resemble the ``look'' of screen displays on the Macintosh.
   A federal judge in July issued a tentative ruling that greatly
narrowed Apple's suit by deciding the items covered in a 1985
licensing agreement between Apple and Microsoft could not be used
as evidence against Microsoft's and Hewlett-Packard's versions of
the products.

   The dollar was little changed in light European
trading early today as the foreign exchange market awaited the
latest U.S. trade figures. Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said the market was positioning itself before the
release of U.S. trade figures for October. Analysts predicted the
deficit would widen to around $8.8 billion from $7.9 billion in
September.
   Dealers said that unless the figures were out of the ordinary,
the dollar should trade within a narrow range for the rest of the
session as markets wind down before the weekend.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.23 Japanese yen to a closing 144.30
yen. Later, in London, it fell back to 144.04 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.7349 West German marks, down from 1.7375;
1.5555 Swiss francs, down from 1.5630; 5.9330 French francs, down
from 5.9420; 1.9605 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9565; 1,293.50

   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6016 from $1.5970 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $409.50 a troy ounce, up
from $407.50 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $410.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.50, up from $408.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 65 cents to close at a bid $409.30.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.62 a troy ounce, up

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite worries about the almost uninterrupted rise
in the market's key index for the past few weeks, share prices on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange posted a new closing high today, while the
dollar remained higher in a narrow range.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 90.34
points, or 0.23 percent, to finish the week at a record closing of
38,271.04.
   The index's previous record closing was 38,180.70 points set
Thursday. It breached 38,000 points on Wednesday, when it gained
258.89 points.
   The market needed only 16 trading days to see the index gain
more than 2,000 points. It first rose above 36,000 on Nov. 21.
   ``Last-minute arbitrage buying by foreign securities firms
pushed up the index'' after the Nikkei index generally remained
weak throughout the day, Hiroshi Bando of Yamaichi Securities Co.
said.
   An arbitrage deal is a common technique to make profits out of
price differentials between the spot and futures markets.
   The Nikkei index has climbed almost without pause in the last
three weeks.
   Bando said there were some investors taking a cautious attitude
over a continued advance in the index, while others were still
expected for higher prices ahead.
   A total of 800 million shares, the same amount traded Thursday,
changed hands on the first section.
   In currency market, the dollar closed at 144.30 yen, up 0.23 yen
from Thursday's close of 144.07 yen. After opening at 144.30 yen,
the dollar ranged betwen 144.25-144.38 yen.
   Yoshitsugu Hanada, a dealer with the Mitsui Bank Ltd., said the
dollar-yen trading was slow the whole day, with many market players
awaiting a series of U.S. economic data, including the October
trade figures, producer prices and industrial production data for
November, all due out later today in Washington.

<HEAD>Wall Street Finds No Cheer In UAL Moves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As UAL Corp. stock continues to tumble, industry
analysts are warning investors not to expect any buyout deal for
the airline company to develop soon.
   ``I suspect it probably will drag on for some time because it's
not an easy package to put together,'' analyst Robert Joedicke of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said Thursday, one day after UAL's
board announced it was still searching for a deal to boost the
company's stock price.
   Investors registered their disappointment on Wall Street. UAL,
the parent of United Airlines, fell $5.50 to $163.25 a share
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange after dropping $8 on
Wednesday.
   Nonetheless, airline industry analysts said they were intrigued
by the board's statement that it would seek discussions with
Coniston Partners, an investment group that owns an 11.8 percent
stake in the company and is pushing for a sale or restructuring.
   Some said the move could indicate a greater willingess by the
board to listen to Coniston's ideas.
   But other observers said UAL directors may simply be trying to
discern how much clout Coniston really carries in its threat to
solicit shareholder consents to overthrow UAL's board.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins would not comment on when a meeting
might be held.
   Paul Tierney, one of Coniston's general partners, said it was
impossible to interpret the board's intentions. But he said
Coniston was concerned about UAL's slow progress in putting
together a transaction to increase shareholder value.
   The New York-based partnership says it will launch its consent
solicitation ``if and when we conclude it would be advantageous.''
   Airline analysts say Coniston probably would have the support of
other stock speculators who suffered steep losses on their UAL
holdings when a $6.75 billion buyout bid by United's pilots and UAL
management collapsed in October.
   But Coniston's three general partners are believed to have
little desire to actually take control of Chicago-based UAL as they
have threatened, since they would then face the same problems that
are hampering the current board's efforts to put a deal together.
   UAL management has drafted a new employee-buyout plan that
reportedly values the company at $240 a share, or $5.43 billion,
but the proposal has not been endorsed by United's pilots or flight
attendants, and the powerful Machinists union has said it would
oppose such a deal.
   ``If you're going to have a meaningful ESOP (employee stock
ownership plan), you must must have the three unions involved,''
Joedicke said.
   Opposition from the Machinists helped scuttle the $6.75 billion
pilot-management bid, in which British Airways PLC also was to have
participated as an equity partner.
   Meanwhile, the United chapter of the Association of Flight
Attendants opened a two-day meeting Thursday in Chicago to elect
new officers.
   Local President Patricia Friend and Vice President Carol Holmes
announced earlier this month that they were stepping down, a move
expected to reduce friction between management and the flight
attendants and perhaps smooth the way toward an employee buyout
agreement.

   Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 7.7
percent in November from 7.3 percent in October, pushed up by
higher mortgage rates, the government said Friday.
   The underlying inflation rate, excluding mortgage payments, was
unchanged at 6.1 percent, the Central Statistical Office said.
   The financial markets had little reaction to the latest
inflation rate, which was better than had been expected.
   Economists had braced themselves for a rise to 7.9 percent after
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major recently announced that more
expensive home loans would push the retail price index up.
   The government has pushed up interest rates sharply to fight
inflation, but the policy has the ironic effect of inflating the
inflation rate.
   Major and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have said repeatedly
that fighting inflation is their No. 1 economic priority, and that
interest rates will stay high as long as is necessary.
   Prices rose 0.9 percent in November, the statistical office
said. Half the month-to-month rise was the result of the mortgage
rates, it said.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 base of 100, stood at 118.5
in November, 117.5 in October, and 110.0 in November 1988, it said.
   Mortgage rates have climbed following the government's latest 1
percentage-point hike in base interest rates to 15 percent in
October.
   The statistical office said there was a sharp rise in food
prices concentrated among seasonal foods in November, partly
because of poor crops caused by the dry summer. There also were
price increases in leisure goods and clothing, it said.
   But there was a small drop in gasoline prices, and some price
discounts for alcoholic beverages, it said.

<HEAD>Guinness Buys Share of Stroh Sparkling Juice Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British brewing giant Guinness PLC says it will
tap a fast-growing non-alcoholic beverage market with the purchase
of a $58 million share of Stroh Brewery Co.'s carbonated juice
business.
   The companies said Thursday that creation of New Era Beverage
Co., in which each will own a 44.5 percent share, is expected to be
completed by the end of the year. The joint venture will make and
sell Stroh's Sundance Natural Juice Sparklers.
   ``In a market that's not growing, we're seeing alcoholic
beverage suppliers turn more to non-alcoholic beverages,'' said
Benjamin Steinman, associate publisher of the trade publication
Beer Marketer's Insights.
   New Era's president and chief executive officer will be Charles
L. Jarvie, former chief executive officer of Dr. Pepper and of
Schenley Industries. Guinness acquired Schenley in 1987.
   Jarvie will head an investor and management group that will hold
the remaining 11 percent of New Era Beverage.
   Also pending at Stroh, the nation's No. 3 brewer behind
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and Miller Brewing Co., is a September
agreement in principle to sell most of its beer brewing and
container facilities and brands to No. 4 Coors Brewing Co. for $425
million.
   A definitive agreement with Coors is expected early next year,
although that transaction has been challenged by smaller brewers as
anti-competitive and also awaits U.S. Justice Department review,
Stroh spokeswoman Lacey Logan said.
   The transactions are independent, Stroh Senior Vice President
George Kuehn said. The Coors agreement provides Stroh would retain
the Van Nuys, Calif., and Memphis, Tenn., plants that produce
Sundance.
   Guinness already markets non-alcoholic products such as Kaliber
lager and Malta malt beverage and wants to expand in that area,
said Chris Davidson, a spokesman at the company's London
headquarters.
   Sundance has more than 50 percent of a U.S. juice and sparkling
water market that is growing at 20 percent a year, Davidson said.
   Sundance is the only nationally marketed sparkling fruit drink.
There are no immediate plans to expand marketing beyond the United
States, Davidson said.
   Privately-held Stroh doesn't divulge sales or earnings, but
analysts estimated 1988 sales at $1.4 billion, including $75
million to $80 million in Sundance sales.
   Guinness, selling products including Guinness Stout, Johnny
Walker and Dewar's White Label Scotch whisky, Tanqueray and
Gordon's gin and I.W. Harper bourbon in 200 countries, had 1988
sales of $4.5 billion, Davidson said.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 15.36 to
2,738.27 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 666 up, 420 down and

   Analysts said investors also seemed uncertain what to make of a
spate of new government figures on the state of the economy.
   Reaction was mildly positive to news that the producer price

<HEAD>Outflows Slow From Junk Bond Funds Though Bad News Keeps Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors have slowed their stampede from
junk-bond mutual funds in recent weeks as a revisionist school of
thought on the risky investments has emerged.
   It goes like this: Junk bond prices are so low that they can
only go up, and the generous yields on the bonds more than
compensate for any risk that the bonds will default.
   ``I think what we've probably attracted are some bottom
fishers,'' said Neal Litvack, a spokesman for mutual-fund operator
Fidelity Investments. ``A lot of people have felt that the
correction has taken place, the headlines are positive, and they're
going to come in at a decent share price.''
   Investors began pulling out of junk bond mutual funds in late
summer, apparently due to news reports of trouble at highly
indebted junk bond issuers such as casino operator Resorts
International Inc. and department store owner Campeau Corp.
   For example, the junk-bond fund run by T. Rowe Price lost 28
percent of its assets from Sept. 1 through Nov. 30., though some of
that was due to a decline in the price of the bonds.
   But Price and other operators of major junk bond mutual funds
say they've seen a slowdown in outflows in recent weeks. Fidelity's
fund even saw a net inflow of money two weeks ago.
   ``There might be a contrarian undercurrent out there that, given
the very high yield, it might be commensurate with the risks
involved,'' said Brian Mattes, a spokesman for Vanguard Group,
another mutual fund operator.
   Junk bonds are issued by companies that have a poor credit
rating or no rating at all. They also are used to fund leveraged
buyouts. Because of their risk of default, they yield more than
investment-grade corporate bonds.
   Junk bonds are no place to put retirement savings. At best, they
are suitable for surplus funds that an investor is willing to lose
should the gamble falter. Many advisers say small investors should
steer clear of them under any circumstance.
   But recently, as the prices of junk bonds have hit new lows,
some experts have proclaimed them a good investment despite the
fact that some of the bonds may default.
   Dick Swingle, the manager of T. Rowe Price's junk-bond mutual
fund, said earlier this month that he considers the high-yield
market ``one of the most undervalued capital market sectors.''
   ``In our opinion, today's negative environment for high-yield
bonds is a window of opportunity for the long-term investor,'' he
said.
   Mutual fund operators say junk-bond funds react sharply to news
reports about junk bond issuers and the high-yield market in
general. Litvack said Fidelity's $1.45 billion junk-bund fund is
the most news-sensitive he's seen.
   ``What it tells you is that people are not terribly secure about
that investment,'' he said.
   A recent New York Times story headlined ``The New Lure of Junk
Bonds,'' which described how some money managers see values in
junk, may have stimulated junk fund investments. But headlines last
week about Campeau's assertion that it might have to place its
department store divisions in bankruptcy reorganization had the
opposite effect.
   Litvack said an investor in a junk fund that pulls his money
based on news reports ``might be better off elsewhere. This fund is
not for people who are faint of heart.''
   Junk fund operators say they take pains to warn potential
investors of the risk.
   But the risk has its reward: Vanguard's $946 million junk-bond
fund yielded 13.24 percent last week, compared with 7.92 for its
Treasury fund, a benchmark for safety.
   However, junk fund yields have varied wildly from year to year,
making a junk fund suitable for long-term investors only. For
example, Vanguard's fund yielded only 2.65 percent in the year
ended Sept. 30, 1987. But in the year ended Sept. 30, 1988, it
yielded 13.55 percent.
   ``One year of negative returns can be fully expected with this
type of fund,'' Mattes said.

<HEAD>Cold Weather Helps Boost Soybeans; Grains Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose moderately in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, bolstered by
cold-weather concerns, but grain futures were mixed.
   Frigid temperatures in the nation's mid-section have supported
the soybean market all week amid perceptions that the cold has
boosted demand for soybean meal as a high-energy livestock feed.
   This morning's temperatures were among the lowest yet this
season, with sub-zero readings across Nebraska, Kansas and much of
the Midwest.
   The cold snap also supported the corn market, but wheat prices
were slightly lower amid profit-taking after moderate gains in the
past week.
   The cold weather was expected to continue for at least another
week but analysts said its influence would fade if new export
business emerges.
   ``It's a market that's waiting for more Russian business, that's
the best way to characterize it,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of
Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.15\ a bushel; corn
was unchanged to \ cent higher with December at $2.35\ a bushel;
oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $1.55{ a
bushel; soybeans were { cent to 2} cents higher with January at
$5.85 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .22 cent higher with
December at 77.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with January at 83.95 cents a pound; live hogs
were .12 cent lower to .33 cent higher with December at 52.85 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .43 cent to 1.20 cents higher
with February at 50.75 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures ended mostly higher on Thursday while pork
bellies fell.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shows Biggest Imbalance in 10 Months</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs with Fitzwater comment after 9th graf, The drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thea nation's merchndise trade deficit soared
to $10.2 billion in October, the biggest imbalance in 10 months, as
imports climbed to a record level, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said the October deficit was 19.8
percent higher than the September imbalance of $8.51 billion.
   The worsening trade balance reflected a big jump in imports,
which climbed 5.1 percent, to an all-time high of $41.21 billion.
   U.S. exports were also up, by 1.1 percent, rising to $31.01
billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports and
exports.
   A worsening in the trade deficit had been expected, given the
fact that imports normally shoot up in October as merchants restock
shelves in preparation for Christmas. However, the size of the
increase caught many economists by surprise.
   For the first 10 months of the year, the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit is running at an annual rate of $109.4 billion, down a
modest 7.7 percent from last year's deficit of $118.53 billion.
   The overall October deficit of $10.20 billion was the largest
since a $10.80 billion deficit in December 1988, although the
August imbalance of $10.10 billion was nearly as high.
   In brighter economic news, wholesale prices, held down by a
sharp drop in gasoline prices, dipped 0.1 percent in November for
the third decline in five months, the government said today.
   The drop in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which
measures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level,
brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of the
year down to 4.6 percent, compared with 4 percent for all of 1988.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
that, despite the October rise in the trade deficit, the deficit
for January through October was $91.2 billion, ``down $6 billion
from the trade deficit for the first 10 months of 1988.''
   ``So it's still moving in the right direction,'' he said.
``We're doing exactly the right thing and now changes are necessary
at this time.''
   On wholesale prices, Fitzwater said the decline for November was
``another example that inflation is low and under control.''
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board said industrial production
edged up 0.1 percent in November as the economy rebounded from the
effects of the Boeing aircraft strike and the San Francisco
Bay-area earthquake that were largely responsible for a 0.6 percent
drop a month earlier.
   In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of the
nation's factories, mines and utilities edged down 0.1 percentage
point to 82.7 percent in November, its lowest rate since April 1988.
   Many economists are looking for very little improvement in the
trade imbalance in the coming year, a forecast which would spell
trouble for the U.S. manufacturing sector, already suffering job
losses because of weakening sales.
   The Bush administration is likely to come under growing pressure
in Congress to erect trade barriers in an effort to stop the flood
of imports into the country.
   As usual, the biggest deficit in October was recorded with
Japan, an imbalance of $4.9 billion, almost half of the total for
the month, as imports from Japan hit a record level.
   Other large deficits included a $1.28 billion imbalance with
Taiwan, an $843 million deficit with Canada and a $783 million
deficit with China.
   The Soviet Union continued to be one of the few countries with
which the United States enjoys a trade surplus, with the October
surplus totaling $123.2 million.
   The poor trade showing in October reflected import gains in a
variety of areas.
   America's foreign oil bill shot up 8.5 percent to $4.38 billion
as the price per barrel rose 71 cents to $17.09 while the number of
barrels imported daily held basically steady at 8.26 million.
   Imports of agricultural products shot up 18 percent to $2.24
billion while imports of industrial supplies were up 14 percent to
$11.7 billion.

<HEAD>GATT Rules EC Soybean Subsidies Unfair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a ruling favorable to the United
States, a world trade panel has ruled that European Commission
subsidies to soybean processors and producers impede trade, a U.S.
official said Friday.
   The soybean case, one of the main American disputes with the
12-nation European trade bloc, had been portrayed as a test of
whether EC agricultural subsidies generally violate international
trade rules.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said a panel set up under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had ruled that
the EC soybean subsidies violate GATT rules and impede trade.
   ``The GATT panel was correct,'' Hills said. ``We look forward to
the EC correcting the problems that have been identified.''
   A GATT spokeswoman confirmed the panel had submitted a report on
the dispute and said the parties had 10 days to react. Another GATT
source confirmed the report, which was not released publicly, was
favorable to the United States.
   American soybean producers and exporters complained in 1987 that
EC subsidies nullified or impaired concessions contained in a 1962
trade agreement. Under that pact, the EC allowed duty-free imports
of soybeans and other oilseeds in exchange for U.S. tariff
concessions.
   The American Soybean Association has claimed that $1.5 billion
in U.S. exports have been affected by the EC subsidies policies.
   EC officials were not immediately available for comment.
   Hills also criticized aspects of an EC proposal to reform
agricultural trade under the latest round of GATT trade talks.
   She said the EC proposal to ``rebalance'' its agricultural
subsidies by reducing them on some products but increasing them on
others ``would not prevent trade distortions, and could reinforce
them.''
   The U.S. has proposed replacing agricultural subsidies with more
visible and more easily removed tariffs that gradually could be
reduced under GATT rules. The EC has said it would accept some
tariffs but oppose eliminating subsidies entirely.
   Hills is in Brussels to participate in two days of talks led by
Secretary of State James Baker. The EC is the United States'
largest trade partner, with $190 billion in two-way trade in 1988.

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said today its 1989
earnings would be reduced by about $500 million because of costs
from a restructuring earlier this year.
   The $500 million in net charges for the year translates to about
$850 million before taxes, Kodak spokesman Henry Kaska said.
   The photography giant said $273 million of the reductions would
be charged to fourth-quarter earnings, significantly more than had
been anticipated. Kodak had already charged $227 million against
earnings for the second quarter and had predicted that the
fourth-quarter charge would be lower.
   Kodak in August announced a major corporate restructuring that
includes between 4,500 and 5,000 job cuts _ about 3 percent of its
worldwide work foce _wage freezes, the sale or consolidation of
many businesses and other cost-cutting measures.
   ``This action reflects our efforts to sharpen the focus if the
Kodak organization by withdrawing from businesses and activities
that do not contribute to shareowner value,'' Kodak Chairman and
Chief Executive Colby H. Chandler said in a statement.
   Chandler said annual earnings would be reduced because of
provisions for write-offs of equipment, materials and inventories
for various businesses. Additional charges will come from special
payment to departing employees.
   ``Our business units and support organizations are clearly
concentrating on value-adding operations and activities,''
Chandler's statement read. ``As a result, Kodak will enter the new
decade as a stronger, more competitive company.''
   Kodak earnings have declined in three straight quarters. The
Rochester-based company reported a 25 percent third-quarter drop to
$329 million, or $1.02 per share, compared to $435 million, or
$1.35 per share, in the same 1988 quarter.
   Earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and 85 percent in
the second quarter compared to year-ago figures. The April-June
quarter included expenses of the restructuring.
   Kodak has blamed its weakness in part on higher operating costs
and no improvement in productivity, deapite strong sales.
   Net earnings for the first three quarters were $589 million, or
$1.82 a share, down 46 percent from $1.09 billion, or $3.35 a
share, in the first three quarters of 1988. The second-quarter
earnings already reflected the $227 million in restructuring costs.
   Sales for the first nine months of the year rose 8 percent to
$13.5 billion from $12.5 billion a year earlier.

   Share prices drifted lower in lackluster trading
Friday on the London Stock Exchange, with dealers content to follow
Wall Street's weak lead.
   News that Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 7.7 percent in
November from 7.3 percent in October was shrugged off by the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended the day
22.3 points, or 0.9 percent, lower at 2,344.7, slightly above its
session low of 2,341.5.
   Volume totaled 444.9 million shares, down from 486.8 million on
Thursday. Dealers said volume dropped sharply in the afternoon,
when interest evaporated.
   Despite the market's bearish tone, traders said selective buying
helped some shares. The bank sector, in particular, stood out from
the rest of the market, although dealers said there were no special
reasons for gains there.

   A midsession selloff drove stock prices broadly
lower today as the market was in the process of absorbing the
impact of the quarterly ``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 43.31 to 2,710.32
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 466 up, 978
down and 510 unchanged.
   Analysts said a gradual early decline in prices picked up speed
after stories crossed financial news wires that Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega had been named chief of government in Panama and was moving
to confront a ``state of war'' arising from U.S. policies.
   Brokers also noted cited pressure on financial stocks after the
Bank of New England announced projected increases in its loan-loss
reserve and non-performing assets, and said it would report a
substantial loss for the year.
   Analysts said the news exacerbated recent worries about the real
estate market in many parts of the country and the problems
real-estate debt might pose should prices of properties lag for an
extended period.
   Bank of New England shares led the active list, down 3} at 8|.
   Federal National Mortgage, a market standout for most of 1989
until real estate-finance worries began to mount, dropped 1{ to 33

   Among the blue-chip industrials, General Electric fell 1[ to

Eastman Kodak 1{ to 40.
   Prices were buffeted around a bit by orders from professional
traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving individual
stocks and a series of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   The so-called triple witching hour, which comes on the third
Friday of the last month of each calendar quarter, did not appear
to have more than a passing effect, however.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.31 to 191.66. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.85 at 374.97.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 169.67 million shares with two

<HEAD>Expensive, Aristocratic Pens May Be The Season's Hottest Gift</HEAD>

   Propelled by the strength of a single human
hand, it glides with ease. Its fit feels custom-made. And it's one
of the season's hottest selling items: Behold, the pen.
   But not just any pen. These are luxury pens, the new must-have
accessory for the Rolex-watch set.
   Sales of fine writing instruments are skyrocketing this
Christmas, with some retailers reporting increases of up to 70
percent.
   ``It's incredible,'' said Bill Wendell, marketing manager for
Waterman pens. ``We can sell every pen we make, and we'll double
sales this year.''
   Unlike fad gifts of Christmases past _ the pet rock, the
Walkman, Giorgio perfume _ the pen is a time-honored piece.
   After all, Puccini used a Parker to write La Boheme, and it was
a Waterman that scripted the end of World War I with the signing of
the Treaty of Versailles.
   Updated to the '90s, the fancy pen is an affirmation of success.
The more aristocratic in design, the better. And the price? It can
be anywhere from three figures to four.
   Wendell calls the pen trend a ``cultural phenomenon'' sparked by
the growing importance of ``high-quality, functional accessories.''
   ``Some people say it's a rebellion against computers,'' said
Lisa Sawyers, manager of Pen &amp; Paper in Nashville, Tenn. ``People
are tired of everything being faxed and computerized. The art of
letter writing is coming back again.''
   A fine pen is more than a nostalgic return to personal
expression. It is ``a status symbol,'' said Jeannette Brewster, a
pen buyer for Cole National Corp., which sells fine pens through
its Things Remembered and HQ Gifts stores nationwide.
   ``Maybe the president (of a company) has one, and when he goes
to a business meeting, everybody wants to have it,'' she said.
   Among the growing menagerie of expensive pens, Cartier, the
master jeweler, is offering its ``Pasha'' fountain pen complete
with 40 coats of lacquer and an 18-karat gold nib, or point, for
$775.
   Then there's Parker Pen's Duofold, a $300 pen drilled from a
solid block of acrylic, trimmed in 22-karat gold and guaranteed not
to explode under airplane pressure.
   For those seeking something more contemporary, there's the Fendi
pen, from the Italian designer of the same name, which is encased
in tiny rings of pale grey rubber and sells for a measly $35.
   The year's best seller may be the Montblanc, the product of an
81-year-old West German company. Topped with a signature white
``snowcap'' reminiscent of its namesake, Europe's highest peak,
Montblanc pens sell for $100 to $7,000 each.
   Retailers say some of Montblanc's success comes from several
years of advertising in magazines like Architectural Digest, Vanity
Fair and Connoisseur. Now that America's appetite for pens has been
whetted, others are riding the wave.
   Waterman, acquired by Gillette Co. in 1987, is spending $5
million a year to market its French-made writing instruments.
   The best pens come in ball point, though they are at the lower
end of the spectrum. Rollerball pens use liquid instead of paste
ink, and therefore are more expensive. The most prestigious is the
fountain pen.
   ``Although the U.S. is a ball-point society, people are finding
the enjoyment of going back and writing with a fountain pen,'' said
Richard Mattes, vice president of marketing for Koh-I-Noor
Rapidograph Inc. of New Jersey, the exclusive North American
Montblanc distributor.
   Fountain pens are the fastest growing category of writing
instruments. About 12 million were sold in 1987; a year later the
number jumped to 21 million.
   ``If you're going to write a love letter ... doesn't it look
better with a fountain pen?'' Mattes asked.
   Because they require special care _ refilling the ink and
occasional professional cleanings, fountain pens have a very
special cachet.
   ``You have to have a bit more leisure time to deal with a
fountain pen,'' said Waterman's Wendell. ``Isn't that the upscale
imagery being projected by the user?''
   All pens must be chosen carefully. But in the case of a fountain
pen, selecting a nib can take hours. Nib widths vary to produce
fine to very broad scripts, and the shape of one's penmanship
depends on the pressure exterted on the nib and the angle it is
held against the paper.
   Over time, the nib conforms to an individual user, and for that
reason, ``one should never lend it,'' Wendell said.
   But despite a luxury pen's ability to elegantly paint words, how
they write often is less important than how they look. Parker's
marketing planner Greg Watts said one businesswoman told him, ``I
don't use this pen to write with. I wear it.''

   A sharp drop in gasoline costs helped push
wholesale prices down in November for the third time in five
months, the government said Friday in a report seen as giving the
Federal Reserve leeway to lower interest rates.
   The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index, was 4.6 percent for the first 11
months of the year, up from 4 percent for all of 1988 but much
lower than was feared earlier this year.
   The index dipped 0.1 percent last month following a 0.4 percent
gain in October and a 0.9 percent spurt in September. It declined
0.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August.
   The roller-coaster ride averages out to an annualized inflation
rate of about 1 percent from June through November, a marked
contrast to the 9 percent-plus rate for the first five months of
the year.
   ``If ever there was an example of inflation coming in like a
lion and going out like a lamb, it was this year,'' said economist
David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer in New York. ``That has to be good news for everyone,
particularly the consumer.''
   Energy prices declined 3.3 percent last month, the sharpest fall
since August. A 7.7 percent drop in gasoline prices more than
compensated for a 0.1 percent rise in natural gas costs and a 0.7
percent hike in heating oil prices.
   Analysts credit the taming of inflation to the Federal Reserve's
tight money policy pursued through this spring. As evidence, they
cited a separate report by the Fed on industrial production in
November.
   The operating rate at the nation's factories, mines and
utilities eased 0.1 percentage point to 82.7 percent, well below
the 10-year high of 84.3 percent at the start of the year, the
central bank said.
   ``Areas that were tight a year ago like chemicals, paper and
metals all have excess capacity. When you have excess capacity, you
see price concessions,'' said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia
State University.
   Since the summer, the Fed has reversed course on monetary
policy, hoping to avoid a recession by permitting interest rates to
fall.
   The latest price report gives the Fed leeway to cut rates
another notch as early as next week, when monetary policy makers
gather for the last of their eight annual meetings, economists said.
   A disappointing trade report for October adds impetus to the
push. According to the Commerce Department, the merchandise trade
gap soared 19.8 percent to $10.2 billion, the highest level in 10
months.
   A drop in U.S. interest rates could help the deficit by
depressing the dollar's value, stimulating exports and discouraging
imports.
   The wholesale price report showed food costs rising a
substantial 0.8 percent in November, following a 1.4 percent jump
in October, the biggest in 22 months. However, they had declined
overall from April through September.
   Pork prices jumped 7.1 percent following a 9.5 percent rise in
October. Prices for turkeys and eggs also rose and dairy prices
were up 3.3 percent, the fifth consecutive increase exceeding 1
percent.
   ``Because of the drought of `88, we slaughtered a lot of milk
cows and we're starting to see a milk shortage as a result,''
Ratajczak said. ``It's going to take a year to reverse that.''
   The increases were partly offset by a 15.1 percent drop in
vegetable costs, rebounding from an 18.9 percent rise a month
earlier, and a 6.5 percent decline in fresh fruit prices. Prices
for fish, chicken, coffee and rice also fell.
   The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy
categories _ a measure many analysts consider a better gauge of
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy _ rose a modest
0.2 percent last month following a 0.1 percent gain in October.
   Increases for a variety of goods were partly offset by a 4.8
percent decline for soaps and detergents and a 0.3 percent decrease
in the passenger car index, which had fallen 1.4 percent in October.
   Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesale
price index stood at 114.8 in November. This meant that a
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost $114.80 last month compared
with $109.80 a year earlier.
   The inflation news was also favorable for earlier stages in the
production process. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.1
percent in November after no change a month earlier. Crude-goods
prices rose 0.4 percent after holding steady in October. Excluding
food and energy, crude goods prices dropped 2.3 percent.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods.

   Wholesale prices, held down by a sharp drop in
gasoline prices, dipped 0.1 percent in November for the third
decline in five months, the government said today.
   The drop in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which
measures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level,
brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of the
year down to 4.6 percent, compared with 4 percent for all of 1988.
   Wholesale inflation flared at a 9.4 percent annual rate through
May, but prices since then have barely budged. The decline in
November followed a 0.4 percent gain in October.
   Food costs, which shot up 1.4 percent in October at the fastest
pace in 22 months, rose 0.8 percent last month. However, they
declined overall from April through September.
   Pork prices jumped 7.1 percent following a 9.5 percent rise in
October. Dairy prices were up 3.3 percent, the fifth consecutive
increase exceeding 1 percent. Prices for processed turkeys and eggs
also rose.
   However, that was partly offset by a 15.1 percent drop in
vegetable costs and a 6.5 percent decline in fresh fruit prices.
Prices for fish, chicken, coffee and rice also fell.
   Energy prices declined 3.3 percent, the sharpest fall since
August. A 7.7 percent drop in gasoline prices more than compensated
for a 0.1 percent rise in natural gas costs and a 0.7 percent hike
in heating oil prices.
   The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy
categories _ a measure many analysts consider a better gauge of
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy _ rose a modest
0.2 percent last month follow a 0.1 percent gain in October.
   Modest increases for many kinds of consumer goods were partly
offset by a 4.8 percent decline for soaps and detergents and a 0.3
percent decrease in the passenger car index, which had fallen 1.4
percent in October.
   Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the wholesale
price index stood at 114.8 in November. This meant that a
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost $114.80 last month, up from
$109.80 a year ago.
   The inflation news was also favorable for earlier stages in the
production process. The price of intermediate goods fell 0.1
percent in November after no change a month earlier.
   Crude-goods prices rose 0.4 percent after holding steady in
October. An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods.
   ``There has been a major deceleration in inflation in almost
every measure ... that looks like it will stay in place in coming
months given how weak the economy is,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
economist of the Boston Co.
   In advance of today's report, many analysts were expecting a
modest 0.2 percent rise in finished goods. The actual 0.1 percent
decline could give a boost to financial markets that are waiting
for the next cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board.
   Inflation is finishing the year quietly largely because of the
economic slowdown engineered months earlier by the Fed, analysts
say.
   The central bank nudged interest rates higher through most of
1988 and into this spring, reversing course as the first signs of
sluggishness emerged this summer.
   The bellwether rate charged among banks for overnight loans is
averaging around 8.5 percent after peaking near 10 percent.
   However, the earlier tightening succeeded in slowing
rate-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and
durable-goods manufacturing. That curbed demand for basic
commodities such as chemicals, paper, metal and rubber and held
down the prices of those items.

   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as pre-weekend profit-taking
offset buying related to the weather.
   Wheat futures finished moderately lower across the board and
corn was narrowly mixed.
   Soybeans closed mostly lower although the contracts for
near-term delivery continued to find support in the bitter cold
Midwestern weather that has boosted domestic demand for soybean
meal as a high-energy livestock feed.
   The cold weather is expected to continue for at least another
week but analysts said its influence will fade if new export
business emerges.
   The weather's market impact is ``more psychological than
anything,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s
floor operations at the Board of Trade.
   ``It isn't going to change the world supply and demand,'' he
said.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures prices were 1{ cents to

<HEAD>Gillette Announes Realignment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co., trying to rebuild profits hurt by
recent takeover battles, announced Friday it would realign its
operations and sell some of its European business, affecting about
750 workers in the process.
   Gillette said it was creating a North Atlantic Shaving and
Personal Care Group that would encompass its shaving products and
toiletries segments.
   The reorganization would make the company more efficient,
Gillette said in a statement.
   The move is part of Gillette's strategy to improve its profits.
In recent years, the firm has fended off takeover attempts by
Revlon Group Inc. and Coniston Partners of New York, but its
earnings suffered as a result.
   This fall, Gillette said it was introducing a new razor, called
Sensor, which would be priced higher than the current brands but
also is designed to offer a closer shave.
   Both the new razor and the new corporate alignment are aimed at
improving the company's profits, said David Fausch, a Gillette
spokesman.
   ``The company's strategy is to work to increase efficiency,
increase profits, increase market share,'' he said.
   The merging of shaving and personal care will mean the
elimination of about 250 jobs, Fausch said. Gillette employs about
29,000 people worldwide.
   In addition, the company will sell its Antica Erboristeria line
of toiletries in Italy, La Toja bath products in Spain, plus
European hair care products. Those operations employ about 500
people.
   Those products have not been as successful as the company had
hoped, Fausch said.
   The operations to be sold represented about $100 million in
sales last year, compared with about $1 billion in worldwide
toiletry sales.
   Proceeds from the sales were expected to offset the costs from
the realignment.

   As the number of days left until Christmas
dwindles into single digits, catalog companies are out to persuade
last-minute shoppers that they don't have to brave crowded malls
and stores.
   Guarantees that gifts ordered as late as the week before
Christmas will arrive in time to be put under the tree are being
touted by catalog companies eager to grab some of the 11th-hour
business.
   Many gift items can be had quickly _ flannel nightgowns from
L.L. Bean Inc. in Freeport, Maine, to filet mignons and elegant
Beef Wellingtons from Omaha Steaks International.
   The holiday shopping surge doesn't flow smoothly between
Thanksgiving and Christmas; it typically comes in two big waves at
the beginning and the end with a long lull in between.
   ``We are in the crucial final sprint right now,'' said retail
analyst Monroe Greenstein with the investment firm Bear Stearns &amp;
Co. Inc.
   The second wave _ which can make or break the season _ has been
a washout for some catalog companies in Christmases past because
customers wouldn't take the risk of being empty-handed on the big
day.
   This year, industry officials guess that possibly more than 150
catalogs are bearing promises that Federal Express Corp., United
Parcel Service Inc. or other rapid delivery services will speed
presents on their way. Some that offered fast delivery in the past
have introduced new extras.
   Sportswear and outdoor gear cataloger Lands' End Inc., based in
Dodgeville, Wis., says anything it has in stock can be shipped via
Federal Express to someone's home within two days and the customer
can designate the day. A customer who works a standard Monday
through Friday week might prefer Saturday delivery, for instance.
The cost is $6 per address, regardless of the size of the order.
   Most catalogs boasting fast service require customers to pay a
bit more, starting at around $4. The charges, which range as high
as $17.00 an order, could turn off some potential shoppers. But
catalogers say they've tried to keep them as low as possible to
appeal to procrastinators willing to pay to be spared some
aggravation.
   Spiegel Inc., which also owns Eddie Bauer and Honeybee, mailed
reminders of its pre-Christmas UPS delivery guarantee to hundreds
of thousands of its five million active customers. The guarantee is
good for orders placed by Dec. 21, provided the item still is
available. It also publicized its holiday program by placing
inserts in newspapers around the country and in Vogue and GQ
magazines.
   Research done by the Milwaukee brokerage Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi
Inc. estimated last year's total catalog sales at $12 billion.
About one-third of all American households bought goods through
more than 900 catalogs, Blunt Ellis says.
   Sales through catalogs, which some analysts say have been
growing at about twice the pace of store sales in recent years,
have expanded to meet the demands of two-income families in which
neither parent or spouse has much time to shop.
   The Direct Marketing Association Inc. says that this year 51.4
percent of the adult U.S. population has ordered at least once by
telephone or mail, up from 24.5 percent in 1983, the first year the
figures were compiled.
   Robert Longendyke, spokesman for Spiegel in Chicago, said
express delivery services have made catalogs a more viable method
of shopping for people in a hurry, especially ahead of Christmas.
   ``Before you had to be one of those prudent people that got down
to it early,'' he said. ``The great thing now is you can
procrastinate without having to go into the stores when they're at
their busiest.''

<HEAD>Chrysler Announces New Incentives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. announced an
incentive program Friday designed in part to maintain production at
its two minivan plants before shutting them down to retool for a
new version.
   The program includes a guarantee that the company will make up
any difference in rebate programs through the first three quarters
of next year _ a time Chrysler has said will include some of the
toughest months in recent automotive history.
   The guarantee is aimed at consumers who may be waiting for more
attractive incentives later in the year, Chrysler Motors Chairman
Ben Bidwell said Friday at a news conference.
   ``We want some (showroom) traffic now,'' Bidwell said.
   Sales Manager Louis Payne of Keensport Chrysler-Plymouth outside
Pittsburgh, Pa., said his dealership could use some traffic.
   ``It's real slow this month,'' he said Friday. ``At this time of
year, it's hard to compete with Santa Claus.''
   Typically, vehicle sales pick up a little in January and fall
off again in February before rebounding in March and April as
weather improves.
   In the past, when one of the Big Three U.S. automakers issued a
new incentive program, the other two soon followed. General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. had no immediate reaction to Chrysler's
move.
   Chrysler's new incentives range from $500 to $2,000, depending
on model, or low-interest financing ranging from 6.9 percent to 9.9
percent, depending on length of loan. Some minivans have an option
of cash rebates or interest rates as low as 3.9 percent on a 2-year
loan.
   The program, which expires Jan. 31, 1990, covers two-thirds of
the cars and light trucks Chrysler makes.
   The incentives on Chrysler's minivans represent the first time
in six years that an enticement has been offered on the popular
vehicles. Since their introduction, Chrysler has commanded more
than 50 percent of the minivan market.
   But that share is being eroded by recent introductions of new
minivans from GM and Mazda Motor Corp. and those already in
showrooms from Ford and a half-dozen or so Japanese companies.
   Chrysler expects to introduce a new version of its Dodge Caravan
and Plymouth Voyager next fall for the 1991 model year.
   Production at Chrysler's minivan plants in Windsor, Ontario, and
St. Louis, Mo., will be shut down in the third week of June and the
third week of July, respectively, to change equipment for the new
models.
   The changeovers will take about four weeks, Bidwell said.
   Analysts have speculated that automakers, faced with swelling
inventories and waning demand, may cut their supplies of unsold
cars by curtailing production during the first quarter of 1990.
   Chrysler said this week that it would shut down its car plant
near St. Louis, causing about 3,400 layoffs, for four weeks
beginning Monday because of slow sales of the Chrysler LeBaron and
the Dodge Daytona. The company also said 3,000 employees of its
Belvidere, Ill., plant, which makes five full-size cars, would be
laid off for two weeks beginning Jan. 2 because of falling sales.
   Bidwell said that won't be the case for Chrysler's minivan
plants, which make a product that's responsible for much of the
company's shrinking profits.
   ``We absolutely do not face downtime except for the
changeover,'' Bidwell said. However, he added, some overtime at the
two plants may be cut.
   Analysts and industry officials have agreed that demand for
minivans will remain strong during next year while the industry as
a whole weakens.
   Chrysler has forecast that 14.2 million cars and light trucks
will be sold in 1990, down from the 14.8 million or so that will be
sold this year. Ford has forecast a slightly slower year in 1990
while GM has forecast the industry will sell 15 million vehicles.

<HEAD>Defense Lawyers Charge Perjury; Say Sherwin Rejected Plea Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   GAF Corp. lawyers alleged Friday that government
witnesses lied in testimony during the company's lengthy stock
fraud trial and said GAF Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin rejected a
last-minute offer that would have cleared him of criminal charges.
   Only hours after the government offered the deal Wednesday, a
federal jury convicted Sherwin and GAF on all eight counts of stock
manipulation, securities fraud and other charges in an alleged 1986
scheme to boost Union Carbide Corp.'s stock price.
   Under the deal, GAF would have pleaded guilty to all counts and
Sherwin would have been released of all charges in the deal,
according to lawyers involved in the case. The company reportedly
had approved the deal.
   But as part of the deal, Sherwin would have had to sign a
statement saying he was acting on behalf of the company in the
unlawful activities alleged by the government.
   Lawyers for Sherwin and GAF plan to appeal the verdict.
   The GAF verdict, which was viewed as a major victory for the
government, came after two mistrials earlier this year.
   Lead GAF attorney Arthur Liman in a statement said WATS line
telephone records from the Jefferies &amp; Co. brokerage, which
allegedly conducted the manipulation for GAF, refuted testimony
that calls were made to Sherwin to discuss the October 1986 scheme.
   ``(Sherwin) is a man of principle who sat through three trials
that were tainted by brazen perjury that was finally exposed by the
WATS records,'' Liman said in a statement. ``We were under no
illusions as to the likely verdict. It was visible on the jurors'
faces.
   ``But the government insisted on a corporate allocution which
would have stripped Jim Sherwin of all self respect and condoned
the perjury. This he could not let the corporation do and he has no
regrets about the decision he made to allow the jury deliberations
to proceed to verdict.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr. declined to
comment on the perjury allegation.
   The government based its case on testimony by admitted felon and
former stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, who testified that he agreed
to bid up the price of Union Carbide at Sherwin's request. GAF was
seeking to sell 5 million shares of Union Carbide after a failed
takeover bid.
   Jefferies also said Sherwin promised to reimburse the brokerage
for any losses. Evidence included an allegedly phony invoice for
$40,000 investment banking advisory services that represented a
trading loss.
   Jefferies &amp; Co. chief trader James Melton and trading assistant
Maureen O'Connor testified about the alleged phone calls.
   Melton claimed he called Sherwin at the end of three consecutive
trading days to discuss the upward manipulation of Carbide stock.
The WATS line records indicated no such calls were made. O'Connor
said she overheard the calls.
   Records for regular phone lines also did not indicate that the
calls were made.
   Also, Jefferies' testimony was contradicted during the second
trial and Liman in his closing arguments said Jefferies' testimony
was ``filled with inconsistencies and contradictions.''
   Sherwin faces up to 40 years in prison and up to $2 million in
fines, but his sentence is expected to be far less than the
maximum. GAF could be fined up to $4 million.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder, Tribune Co., NY Times Co. Discuss Earnings Outlooks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media giant Knight-Ridder Inc. said Friday it
expects to post higher earnings this year and that savings from its
recently-enacted newspaper joint operating agreement in Detroit
will boost 1990 earnings.
   Tribune Co., meanwhile, said it expects a profit increase for
1989 but said earnings growth would be more difficult to achieve in
1990 due to impending labor negotiations, slow advertising revenue
growth and weak newsprint prices.
   New York Times Co. said a gain on the sale of its cable
operations would mean record 1989 earnings, but earnings from
continuing operations _ excluding the cable sale gain _ would be
down substantially. It expects higher earnings in 1990 excluding
the cable sale gain.
   The companies discussed their earnings prospects before
securities analysts attending the annual PaineWebber media outlook
conference.
   Advertising revenue growth from Miami-based Knight-Ridder's 29
daily newspapers, lower newsprint prices and lower interest costs
were cited for contributing to the company's stronger 1989 earnings
outlook.
   James K. Batten, chairman and chief executive, declined to offer
a specific projection of earnings.
   But securities analysts have estimated 1989 earnings per share
from continuing operations will amount to between $2.80 and $2.90
compared with net income of $2.59 a share in 1988 and 1990 earnings
per share from continuing operations of $3.40 to $3.50.
   Batten said one major contributor to earnings growth in 1990
would be the recent enactment of the joint operating agreement
between Knight-Ridder's Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News,
owned by Gannett Co. Inc.
   He said the agreement, which combined business operations of the
newspapers while news and editorial staffs operate separately,
means an end to 11 consecutive years of operating losses at the
Free Press.
   Batten said the Free Press was expected to lose between $13
million and $16 million in 1989, excluding corporate charges but
that the company ``won't lose money in Detroit next year.''
   Batten said the end of losses at the Detroit newspaper,
contiunued soft newsprint prices, improvement at The Miami Herald
and strong results from business information services will help
1990 earnings.
   Chicago-based Tribune Co. said strong growth in its broadcasting
and entertainment businesses as well as increases from newspapers
should help it post earnings per share of $3.10 in 1989, up from
$2.78 in 1988.
   But Scott Smith, senior vice president and chief financial
officer, although the company would like higher earnings per share
in 1990, ``this may be a difficult goal to achieve.''
   He said the company faces ``difficult labor negotiations''
involving workers at the Daily News in New York. He said contract
talks also will occur next year involving newsprint production
workers in Canada and major league players. Tribune Co. owns the
Chicago Cubs baseball team.
   Smith said newspaper ad revenues were up 4.5 percent to 5
percent in 1989 and should be slightly higher in 1990. But he said
weakness in newsprint prices may persist, hurting Tribune's results
from newsprint operations.
   New York Times Co. earned $2.08 a share in 1988 and posted a
gain of $2.46 per share this year on the sale of its cable system.
   It announced earlier this week it intended to charge 57 cents a
share against fourth-quarter earnings, reflecting estimated costs
of voluntary staff cuts at its flagship newspaper due to a weak
advertising climate in New York, further automation of production
facilities and a decline in its valuations of its investment in
forest products operations.
   Walter E. Mattson, president and chief operating officer, said a
7 percent decline in ad linage at the Times offset the effects of
tighter cost controls. That combined with lower newsprint prices in
1989 will produce flat operating results from newspapers, excluding
special charges taken in 1988.
   He said results from magazines would decline from 1988, showing
a loss for the year due to acquisitions, but that broadcast and
information services were up and regional newspapers had a record
year. Newsprint business results also are down sharply, he said.
   Mattson said with the charges, the company lost money in the
fourth quarter and that earnings from continuing operations ``will
be down substantially for the year.'' Including the cable gain,
however, the company will have record earnings for the year.
   He said he agreed with analysts who have predicted ``another
year of low earnings'' in 1990 but said earnings should top 1989
results, excluding the cable sale.

<HEAD>Henley Group Split Into Two Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of The Henley Group
Inc. on Friday approved splitting the conglomerate into two
companies.
   The division continues a program that Henley has pursued of
creating new publicly held companies.
   The two new companies are Henley Properties Inc., specializing
in real estate, and a new company called The Henley Group Inc.,
which will hold all the remaining assets.
   ``Separating our extensive real-estate operations from Henley's
other businesses and investments continues our policy of grouping
complementary assets in public companies so these assets can be
better understood and evaluated by investors,'' said Michael
Dingman, chairman and chief executive officer of the existing
conglomerate.
   Stockholders will get one share of the new Henley Group as a
tax-free distribution for each share they hold in the existing
company as of Dec. 20. The remainder will be renamed Henley
Properties.
   Henley Properties, with assets of $650 million, will own the
existing company's real estate developments and acreage in southern
California, Hawaii, Wisconsin, Michigan and New Hampshire.
   The new Henley Group Inc. will own the existing company's
remaining assets of about $3.5 billion. Included are two wholly
owned subsidiaries: Fisher Scientific Group Inc., which makes and
distributes laboratory and medical products; and Pneumo Abex Corp.,
which makes equipment for aircraft and friction-braking products
for cars, trucks and other vehicles. Cape Horn Methanol Ltd., now
mostly owned by Henley, will be part of the new company.
   Cape Horn Methanol makes methanol from natural gas in Chile.
   Henley Properties will include the existing company's wholly
owned subsidiary Signal Landmark Holdings Inc., which the company
described as a major developer of residential commercial and
industrial real estate, mainly in southern California and Hawaii.
Henley said Signal Landmark also owns more than 300,000 acres of
recreational and residential real estate in northern Michigan and
Wisconsin.
   The company said Henley Properties also will own the existing
company's half-interest in Wentworth by the Sea, an oceanfront
project in New Castle, N.H., consisting of a planned hotel at the
site of an old resort hotel; a 200-slip marina; a golf course; and
restaurants and homes.

   General Motors Corp. will buy half of Saab-Scania
AB's troubled car business for about $600 million, in a deal
analysts described Friday as a good one for both companies.
   The analysts' endorsement of the association is far different
from the concern some voiced seven weeks ago when Ford Motor Co.
announced it would buy all of British automaker Jaguar PLC for $2.5
billion.
   ``GM paid about $3,000 per unit and Jaguar went for about
$40,000 per unit,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., referring to the ratio of investment price and the sales of
Saab and Jaguar cars.
   ``One way to look at the $600 million is that's how much it
takes to build a new car,'' he said.
   GM and Saab will form a new independent Swedish car company
called Saab Automobile AB which will produce cars under the Saab
name for worldwide distribution and some GM models for the European
market.
   In Sweden, Saab-Scania President Georg Karnsund said in a
statement that times are tough for low-volume automakers. Saab's
car operations lost $186.1 million during the first eight months of
this year.
   ``Soaring costs for research and development and ever-increasing
international competition make it difficult for small-volume makers
to survive on their own in a longer perspective,'' he said.
   ``For GM,'' said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody Inc. in
New York, ``I think there are some definite benefits. They get
greater access to the Scandinavian market and the European market
in general.
   ``The days of the smaller, niche-oriented companies are getting
fewer and farther between,'' he said.
   Under their agreement, GM and Saab will invest $100 million in
the new venture. Each company will nominate five members of the
10-member board, and GM will nominate the chairman.
   The company will manufacture and distribute cars under the Saab
name for sale through Saab's independent dealer network and produce
GM cars for sale through GM's Europe organization, GM said in a
statement.
   ``Saab products are considered a premium brand. They have a good
image for high technology and performance,'' said GM spokesman Jack
Harned in Detroit.
   Also under the agreement, Saab will form a new Saab-Scania
Automotive Electronics AB, in which GM will have a minority share,
to research, develop and manufacture advanced auto electronics
systems.
   Saab-Scania's Karnsund also said an agreement had been reached
between Saab Missile and GM Hughes Aircraft Co., a GM subsidiary,
to develop and produce tactical missiles.

<TEXT>
   A letter of intent for Coors Brewing Co. to buy
Stroh Brewing Co.'s domestic beer making operations for $425
million expired Friday with no sale, freeing Stroh to seek other
buyers, the companies said.
   Chris Sortwell, Stroh vice president for corporate planning and
development, said the companies agreed not to discuss details, such
as whether the price or antitrust considerations were stumbling
blocks to the buyout.
   But Coors President Peter Coors cited unresolved issues in the
transaction as originally contemplated and concern with antitrust
issues.
   ``We felt it best for both parties to take a fresh look at
things and explore other alternatives,'' he said.
   Stroh Chairman Peter Stroh said his company expects to continue
discussions with Coors, although on terms different from those in
the letter of intent. Stroh Brewing also will consider discussions
with others, he said.
   ``Apparently they have opened up the negotiations to anyone,''
said Allan Kaplan, beverage analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New
York. ``It does sound like the deal is off. I think they must have
disagreed on price,''
   Stroh officials wouldn't discuss whether others have made
overtures, Sortwell said.
   Stroh has argued that combining with Coors would increase
competition by creating an effective No. 3 competitor to go against
Anheuser-Busch Cos., the leader with 41 percent of the market, and
No. 2 Miller Brewing Co., which has 21 percent.
   Stroh now is No. 3 with an 11 percent market share and Coors is
No. 4 with just under 8 percent, followed by G. Heileman &amp; Co. with
about 7 percent.
   ``Although we continue to believe that consolidation in the
brewing industry would be good for long-term competition, we are
taking aggressive steps to strengthen our ability to compete
independently,'' Stroh said.
   Preparations for possible independent operation included recent
employment cuts and sales of Stroh assets, Sortwell said. ``As of
right now, it would appear to be somewhat likely,'' he said.
   On Thursday, the 139-year-old Detroit company said it had agreed
to sell its Sundance Natural Juice Sparkler business for $58
million to a partnership in which Stroh and Guinness PLC each would
hold a 44 percent interest.
   Stroh has sought potential partners since February and announced
Aug. 31 it was laying off 300 of its 1,500 white-collar employees
nationwide because there had been no suitable offers.
   Members of Wisconsin's congressional delegation asked the U.S.
Justice Department in November to prohibit the Coors-Stroh
transaction as anti-competitive. The department's antitrust
division was reviewing the deal.
   Also pending is a federal lawsuit by S&amp;P Co., a Mill Valley,
Calif., company that owns several smaller breweries, including
Pabst Blue Ribbon Hamms, Olympia and Falstaff and commands a 4
percent market share. The suit contends the combination would
overwhelmingly increase the market share of the nation's four
largest brewers.

<TEXT>
   A regional real estate slump prompted Bank of New
England Corp. to announce Friday it will sharply boost reserves
against bad loans and that it expects a substantial loss for the
year.
   The bank also announced it had reassigned a senior executive
overseeing its real estate group, that it was considering the sale
and merger of some operations and that it may rescind its common
stock dividend declared Nov. 27.
   ``In my history of following bank stocks, that action is
unprecedented,'' said James Moynihan, senior vice president of
Advest Inc. in Boston, referring to the stock move. ``I think what
it tells you is the deterioration of the real estate market is
getting faster. It goes from bad to worse every day.''
   ``It may be in the best interest of the company to preserve its
capital, even at the expense of shareholders,'' he said.
   Marcia Ryan, a spokeswoman for the bank, said a dividend of 34
cents a share had been declared for the fourth quarter ending Dec.
31. ``What we're saying is we're looking at a very large addition
to our reserves and that is going to change the (dividend)
calculations,'' she said.
   Bank of New England, which had a loan loss reserve of $354
million at the end of the third quarter, said it would boost that
total to more than $1 billion in the current quarter.
   The company already had taken provisions for problem loans
totaling about $207.3 million in the nine months ended Sept. 30.
   Bank of New England stock tumbled $3.37{ to $9 a share in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
   The company, owner of the region's second-largest bank,
indicated in late November that it expected a substantial loss for
the fourth quarter due to the sluggish area economy and a soft real
estate market. At that time, Bank of New England announced the sale
of a major portion of its leasing operations to the Bank of Tokyo
as part of a strategic restructuring.
   The latest move follows similar steps taken by other financial
institutions.
   Bank of Boston, the largest bank in New England, reported a $125
million loss in its third quarter after setting aside money to
cover problem loans.
   Much of the trouble stems from the region's real estate market,
which boomed during the middle 1980s but now has gone sour. As a
result, banks have found many developers are having trouble making
loan payments.
   Bank of New England Chairman Walter J. Connolly Jr. issued a
statement saying the additional money placed in reserves was
appropriate to the quality of the bank's loan portfolio and
existing economic conditions in New England.
   Non-performing assets are expected to increase to $1.6 billion,
but the company said it projects its capital ratios will exceed
regulatory minimums.
   Connolly also said the bank's senior management, along with a
special committee of the board of directors, was addressing the
company's loans and assets.
   Executive Vice President James Sweeney, who had been head of the
real estate group, has been removed from that position and assigned
to other duties in the company.
   ``The finger has to point at someone,'' Moynihan said. ``These
problems are real estate related. Some changes had to be made.''
   The bank announced that Executive Vice President Hugh Taylor,
head of the corporate banking group, will take over the real estate
division until a permanent head is selected.
   Bank of New England also announced the special committee and
management will look at steps to increase shareholder values,
including possible mergers and sales of assets.
   The company posted a profit of $121.6 million in the nine months
ended Sept. 30, down from $207.7 million in the same period a year
earlier.

   The dollar finished mostly lower Friday in
dealings that remained thin despite the release of key economic
data.
   Gold prices gained more than $5 an ounce, mostly on speculative
buying.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose $5.60 a troy ounce to settle at $413.90. Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold even higher at
$414.50 an ounce, up $6.20 from Thursday's late bid.
   The government's latest reports on the economy proved bearish
for the dollar. The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit
widened to $10.2 billion in October, greater than the $9 billion
traders had expected.
   A large deficit makes a case for a lower dollar, which helps
improve the trade gap by making imports more expensive and exports
cheaper.
   Separately, the government said producer prices slipped 0.1
percent in November, bucking predictions that called for a 0.1
percent gain.
   After the figures were released, ``the dollar came off fairly
substantially,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of
Boston's New York office. The dollar fell below the critical 1.7210
level against the West German mark, leading traders to believe the
currency is gathering momentum to move lower.
   News of Panama declaring that a ``state of war'' exists with the
United States helped the dollar strengthen a bit and gave gold
prices a boost.
   But another mild tremor shook the currency market late in the
session when the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was briefly
down 45 points. The dollar finished at lower levels in sparse
trading.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.23 Japanese yen to a closing 144.30
yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 144.10 yen. In New York the
dollar closed at 144.15 yen, unchanged from late Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6055 from $1.5970 late
Thursday. In New York one pound cost $1.6030, more expensive than
Thursday's $1.6010.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday, included: 1.7190 West German marks, down from 1.7344;
1.5480 Swiss francs, down from 1.5630; 5.8785 French francs, down
from 5.9285; 1,283.50 Italian lire, down from 1,292.50, and 1.1608
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1598.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.7225 West German marks, down from 1.7375; 1.5485 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5630; 5.8885 French francs, down from 5.9420;
1.9480 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9565; 1,286.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,295.75, and 1.1606 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1585.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $412.25 a troy ounce
from $407.50 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal
rose to a closing bid of $412.50 from $408.50 bid late Thursday.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid $409.30.
   Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $5.62 a troy ounce
from $5.58 bid late Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $5.607 an ounce, up from
Thursday's $5.557.

   A midsession selloff drove stock prices lower
Friday amid worries about real-estate finance and the outlook for
the economy in early 1990.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.08 to
2,739.55, reducing its gain for the week to 8.11 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
619 up, 924 down and 470 unchanged.
   Analysts said a gradual early decline in prices picked up speed
after stories crossed financial news wires that Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega had been named chief of government in Panama and was moving
to confront a ``state of war'' arising from U.S. policies.
   Brokers also cited pressure on financial stocks after the Bank
of New England announced projected increases in its loan-loss
reserve and non-performing assets, and said it would report a
substantial loss for the year.
   Analysts said that development exacerbated recent worries about
the real estate market in many parts of the country and the
problems real-estate debt might pose should prices of properties
lag for an extended period.
   Bank of New England shares led the active list, down 3] at 9 on
volume of more than 4.64 million shares.
   Among other regional banking issues, Bank of Boston lost 1| to
17[; Shawmut National 1[ to 19]; Citytrust Bancorp 1] to 17[; First
Fidelity Bancorp 1 to 23, and Southeast Banking 1] to 20\.
   Federal National Mortgage, a market standout for most of 1989
until real estate-finance worries began to mount, dropped } to 33}
in active trading.
   Among the blue-chip industrials, Philip Morris fell ] to 42[;
General Motors 1 to 42{; American Express { to 33\, and Eastman
Kodak ] to 41[.
   Stocks were buffeted around a bit by orders from professional
traders engaged in computer-program strategies involving individual
stocks and a series of expiring options and futures on stock
indexes.
   But the so-called triple witching hour, which comes on the third
Friday of the last month of each calendar quarter, actually
appeared to help the market cut its losses in late trading.
   At its midafternoon low, the Dow Jones industrial average showed
a drop of more than 43 points.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 240.39 million
shares, up from 178.70 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 273.67 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $10.16 billion, or 0.30
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .52 to 193.45.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped .65 to 399.91, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down .79 at 350.14.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
3.64 to 443.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 375.50, down 1.32.

   A blast of frigid air pushed heating oil futures
prices to a four-year high Friday, while crude oil futures surged
on reports of new political moves in Panama.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
No. 2 heating oil jumped 3.14 cents to 70.42 cents a gallon in
active trading. Domestic heating oil last closed higher on Jan. 10,
1986, when it hit 72.53 cents a gallon, according to John Santana,
statistical analyst for the New York Merc.
   The contract closed out the week with a gain of 4.05 cents from
its 66.37-cent finish last Friday.
   West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude oil,
jumped 45 cents to end at $21.15 per 42-gallon barrel. It was the
highest level since April 26, when the near-term crude contract
closed at $21.19 a barrel.
   ``Today, Panama was definitely the major factor in the crude
market,'' said James Steel, energy analyst for Refco Inc.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for January ended the session at
52.80 cents a gallon, a gain of 1.19 cents on the session and 0.65
cent for the week.
   Sub-freezing temperatures throughout much of the nation have
boosted demand for heating oil in recent days and spurred buying in
crude and gasoline markets, analysts said. Logistical problems in
Europe due to the low water level of the Rhine River also
contributed to the demand spurt.
   ``The River Rhine rose a foot this week, but the situation still
had a moderating impact on U.S. markets this week,'' said Peter
Beutel, energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.
   Meanwhile, Manuel Antonio Noriega's rubber-stamp legislature
Friday named him chief executive of Panama and gave him sweeping
powers to confront U.S. efforts to oust the combative general.
   Refco's Steel said events in Panama prompted concerns about the
possible closure of the Panama Canal and disruption of oil
shipments.
   ``A lot of oil goes from the Gulf Coast and Middle East through
the canal to the West Coast,'' he said.

<HEAD>Puts 1989 Restructuring Costs at $500 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Friday that costs
related to a restructuring announced this year would reduce fourth
quarter earnings by $273 million, significantly more than the
company had predicted.
   The $273 million charge brings Kodak's total 1989 restructuring
costs to $500 million, or $850 million before taxes, spokesman
Henry Kaska said. The photography giant had charged $227 million
against its second quarter earnings.
   Kodak had estimated earlier this year that fourth quarter
charges would be lower than those in the second quarter.
   ``Charges have evolved as plans have finalized,'' Kaska said.
``It's the difference between predictions and actual experience.''
   Kodak has now accounted for all charges associated with the
restructuring, Kaska said.
   ``Charges in 1990 should be only those that occur in the normal
course of our ongoing operations,'' he said.
   Kodak announced a restructuring plan in August designed to save
the company $1 billion in costs and turn around its sagging
profits. The plan includes selling or reorganizing about 20
businesses and cutting more than 4,500 jobs _ about 3 percent of
Kodak's worldwide workforce _ as well as freezing wages and other
cost-cutting measures.
   ``This action reflects our efforts to sharpen the focus of the
Kodak organization by withdrawing from businesses and activities
that do not contribute to shareowner value,'' Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Colby H. Chandler said.
   ``Our business units and support organizations are clearly
concentrating on value-adding operations and activities,'' he said.
``As a result, Kodak will enter the new decade as a stronger, more
competitive company.''
   Kodak earnings have declined in three straight quarters. The
Rochester-based company has blamed its poor showing on higher
operating costs and no improvement in productivity, as well as
competition from abroad.
   Earnings dropped 25 percent in the third quarter to $329
million, or $1.02 a share, vs. $435 million or $1.35 per share in
the same 1988 quarter.
   Earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and 85 percent in
the second quarter, when the first restructuring charges were
recognized. Net earnings for the first three quarters were $589
million, or $1.82 a share, down 46 percent from $1.09 billion, or
$3.35 per share, in the first three quarters of 1988.
   Mark Obenzinger, a stock analyst at Trinity Trading Co. in New
York, predicted that Kodak would do no better than break even in
the fourth quarter of 1989.
   Earnings in 1990 will improve simply because there will be no
more charges, he said, but Kodak will face a number of challenges
to improving profits in the first half of the year.
   Among those challenges is the expected ruling on how much Kodak
will have to pay Polaroid for violating its instant camera patent _
predicted to be in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. The company
also faces fierce foreign competition and a weak economy,
Obenzinger said.
   ``As you go into the first quarter of 1990 it's going to be a
fairly interesting time,'' he said. ``This addresses the ills of
the past but does not guarantee them the future.''
   Kaska said slightly more than a third of the $500 million charge
reflects inventory writeoffs from the businesses Kodak is exiting.
   Other costs include writeoffs of equipment and goodwill costs _
the amount a company pays for an asset in excess of its value, and
benefits paid to departing employees, he said.
   Kodak has so far announced the sale of 10 businesses, and Kaska
said the company hopes to have the sale of at least 10 more
completed in the next two weeks.

   Two former executives of a United
Technologies Corp. division pleaded guilty Friday to obtaining
inside information from a Navy official about a defense contract
competition.
   James E. Rapinac, 54, a former senior vice president of the
Norden Systems division, and C. J. ``Jack'' Richardson, 48, a
former Norden marketing executive, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
defraud the government.
   They agreed to cooperate with the long-running investigation of
procurement fraud and influence peddling, nicknamed ``Operation Ill
Wind,'' that has netted convictions of 29 individuals and four
corporations.
   ``While I offer no excuses for my actions, I do believe the
defense acquisition process is conducive to abuses,'' Rapinac said.
   Rapinac and Richardson each could face up to five years in
prison and fines up to $250,000 when U.S. District Judge Claude M.
Hilton sentences them March 9.
   They admitted paying $27,500 to Washington defense consultant
Thomas E. Muldoon for inside information on the award of a Marine
Corps contract to build a radar command and control system worth up
to $150 million.
   With the help of another defense consultant, Mark Saunders,
Muldoon obtained information about the confidential selection
process being conducted by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems
Command, according to court papers filed by the prosecution Friday.
   Saunders got the information from George Stone, then a senior
procurement official at the naval command, and gave it to Muldoon
to be relayed to Rapinac and Richardson, according to the statement
of facts filed by prosecutors in the case.
   Muldoon provided information about how various Navy procurement
boards ranked the proposals of competing defense companies and told
Rapinac and Richardson what other companies were bidding, advising
Norden to lower its bid to $95 million, prosecutors said.
   Neither Stone nor Saunders has been charged.
   Muldoon, 59, was convicted Thursday for participating in a
scheme by a Whittaker Corp. subsidiary to funnel bribes to a Marine
Corps contracting official. He faces a possible 70-year prison
sentence on that conviction.
   Prosecutors describe Muldoon as a major figure in the Pentagon
procurement scandal.
   Norden abruptly withdrew from the competition in June, 1988,
when the ``Ill Wind'' investigation became public, prosecutors said.
   In a letter to employees, United Technologies Chairman Robert F.
Daniell said the actions of the former Norden executives ``were
wrong and violated clear company policies.''
   ``This unfortunate occurrence compels me to remind all employees
we are committed to upholding the law and maintaining the highest
standards of ethical conduct,'' Daniell said.
   Company spokesman Dan Harrison said United Technologies is
cooperating with the investigation.
   Court papers said that Norden's president, Edward Decker
approved the consulting agreement with Muldoon. But Harrison said
that approval of all consulting agreements by the president was
standard procedure and Decker did not authorize ``illegally
obtaining government information.''
   Stone's attorney, Brian Gettings, called the allegations against
his client ``a lot of hearsay.''
   Also Friday, Hilton sentenced two former executives of a
Whittaker Corp. subsidiary for participating in a scheme to bribe a
Marine Corps procurement officer. Both pleaded guilty to bribery
charges.
   Scott M. Lamberth, 59, a former vice president of Whittaker
Command and Control Systems, received a 10-month sentence $10,000
fine for his involvement in a scheme to funnel more than $80,000 to
the procurement official.
   John Franklin Van Tassel, 53, who headed the company's
Fayetteville, Ark., operation, was ordered to serve three months in
a halfway house and fined $3,000.
   The bribes were funneled to Jack A. Sherman through Muldoon and
two other defense consultants. Sherman is serving an 18-month
prison term for participating in another bribery scheme.

<HEAD>Panama News Helps Boost Gold, Oil Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's latest declaration of hostility against the United
States sent gold prices up sharply Friday and contributed to a
dramatic rise in energy prices by sparking fears of a disruption in
shipments through Panama.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures advanced
and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.50 to $5.60 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December up
$5.60 at $413.90 a troy ounce. Silver finished 4.7 cents to 5.7
cents higher with December at $5.607 a troy ounce.
   Gold initially drew strength from news that the U.S. trade
deficit widened to $10.2 billion in October. The Commerce
Department report prompted a weakening of the dollar against other
major currencies, which is frequently a buy signal for gold.
   News of the passage of a resolution by the Panama People's
assembly of a resolution stating that Panama is in a ``state of war
while the (U.S.) agression lasts'' reached the gold market late in
the session and triggered fresh buying.
   The rally reflected investor flight to the perceived safety of
gold and other precious metals, which is typical during periods of
heightened international tensions.
   ``I think the markets at the moment are in somewhat of a bullish
trend and susceptible to bullish moves on any news of this nature
that comes out,'' said Anne Orton, a vice president of Deak
International Inc., a New York-based dealer of precious metals and
currencies.
   The gold runup also was a response to a sharp drop in stock
prices in the middle of the afternoon, reminding observers that a
stock-market dive on Oct. 13 had marked the starting point of
gold's recent surge from levels near $360 an ounce.
   Spot gold has been trading within a range between $400 and $420
for more than a week but analysts said the market's pronounced
behavior on Friday indicated underlying bullishness.
   ``Even if it goes down to $390, the trend remains up,'' said
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. ``The
dollar's weak and I think that will be a long-term bullish backdrop
for gold.''
   Heating-oil futures surged mightily on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the market's 12th rise in the last 13 sessions, in
anticipation of bone-chilling cold weather in the Northeast
   Sub-zero temperatures were recorded Friday in the nation's
mid-section, and the cold front was expected to invade the populous
Northeastern United States during the weekend.
   The Panama news was supportive but represented only ``a blip of
maybe 30 points'' in heating oil's 314-point gain, said analyst
Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   However, the possibility of oil supply disruptions through the
Panama Canal helped boost crude oil prices, analysts said.
   Heating oil settled 1.04 cents to 3.14 cents higher with January
at 70.42 cents a gallon; West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 10
cents to 45 cents higher with January at $21.10 a barrel; unleaded
gasoline was .96 cent to 1.19 cents higher with January at 52.80
cents a gallon.
   Cold weather has slowed livestock marketings and continued to
support livestock and meat futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle finished .02 cent lower to .52 cent higher with
December at 77.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .55
cent higher with January at 84.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .20 cent higher with December at 52.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.10 cents higher with
February at 51.42 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as pre-weekend profit-taking offset
weather-related buying.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 4{ cents lower with December
at $4.13 a bushel; corn futures were } cent lower to 1 cent higher
with December at $2.35} a bushel; oats were \ cent to { cent lower
with December at $1.43{ a bushel; soybeans were 2} cents lower to 1

<HEAD>Arby's Gets New President, Franchisees Call Truce</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Belatti was named president and chief
operating officer of Arby's Inc. Friday in a move hailed by a group
of dissident franchisees as a step toward ending their feud with
the fast-food chain's parent.
   Belatti was the chain's executive vice president for marketing
and has in the past been critical of industrialist Victor Posner,
who controls DWG Corp., the Miami Beach, Fla., parent of Arby's.
Particularly, Belatti opposed a plan to move Arby's headquarters to
Florida.
   Posner, however, praised Belatti on Friday as a company man who
would maintain Arby's growth. Belatti was recommended by Jay
Darling, a former president of Burger King Corp. who had been
retained as a consultant in DWG's search for a new Arby's president.
   The possibility of moving the headquarters out of Atlanta has
been among major points of contention in a quarrel that has been
raging since the summer between Posner and many of the chain's
franchisees.
   Renee Mottram, a spokeswoman for DWG, said that Posner still
plans to move Arby's headquarters to Miami Beach by 1991.
   The franchisee group, headed by former Arby's President Leonard
H. Roberts, sought to buy Arby's, a move resisted by Posner.
   The group charged that a variety of legal and financial problems
faced by Posner was threatening the stability of the chain, which
specializes in roast beef sandwiches.
   Roberts said Friday that Belatti's appointment signaled an
apparent end to the friction within the company.
   Roberts said he was stepping down as president of A.P.
Association, an organization of franchisees representing about 75
percent of the chain's 2,150 restaurants.
   But he took a parting shot at Posner.
   ``I hope the stability achieved this week by the Arby's system
is permanent,'' Roberts said. ``But I urge you to be mindful of
what has happened to other companies that Posner has controlled.
   ``And if instability returns, I urge you to recall the values of
unity and mobilization. They do get results,'' he said.
   Roberts, who was popular with the chain's franchisees, was
ousted from Arby's in September after he clashed with Posner over
the $200 million takeover bid. The two had been in a verbal war
ever since, with Posner at one point accusing Roberts of waging a
misinformation campaign with ``ugly press releases.''
   Posner acquired Arby's in 1984 as part of Chesapeake Financial
Corp.'s $400 purchase of Royal Crown Companies Inc. Posner's DWG
owns 60 percent of Chesapeake.
   The fast-food chain had total revenues of $153.8 million last
year and operating profit of $20.7 million.

<HEAD>Court Stalls Warner's Bankruptcy Settlement Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday froze the
distribution of funds in financier Marvin L. Warner's $16 million
personal bankruptcy settlement to allow more time to consider a
government appeal.
   The former Ohio financier won approval of the plan from a
federal bankruptcy judge in Jacksonville, Fla., Dec. 4, following
two years of legal wrangling. But the major creditor, the Internal
Revenue Service, filed an immediate appeal.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal ruled to hold off on
paying creditors indefinitely while it considers the IRS arguments
that Warner's assets could be gone before it gets paid.
   Under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan, the IRS is to receive a
total of $13 million in six annual installments. If the appeals
court had not made some kind of ruling by Friday, the plan would
have gone into effect.
   Warner, 70, a former U.S. ambassador to Switzerland whose
fortune crumbled after his Home State Savings Bank in Cincinnati
collapsed, said he did not have an immediate comment on the ruling.
Warner lives on an Ocala, Fla., horse ranch.
   ``I believe ultimately the plan will be confirmed,'' said
court-appointed bankruptcy trustee Ronald Mowrey in Jacksonville.
``As it stands now, no payment has been made to anybody yet.''
   The bankruptcy plan also included $3.6 million in fees to
attorneys and accountants who spent thousands of hours analyzing
Warner's financial transactions since Home State's 1985 collapse.
   Warner filed for protection from creditors in October 1987 under
federal bankruptcy law to halt $4 billion in claims against him.
   A jury in Ohio found Warner guilty in March 1987 on charges
resulting from Home State's collapse. Warner was sentenced to 3{
years in prison, but a state appellate court recently rejected the
convictions.
   Ohio prosecutors plan to ask the state Supreme Court to
reinstate the convictions.

   Mack Trucks Inc., which lost more than
$100 million in the first nine months of the year, announced Friday
it is in technical default of $309 million in loans.
   A Mack subsidiary, Mack Financial Corp., has violated
stipulations of the loans and the company asked the lenders to
waive the requirements, said Walter Meck, chief financial officer.
Mack already has renegotiated $147 million in loans.
   The company is still making payments but has not complied with
the stipulations that require the company to maintain financial
health.
   Stock market analysts said technical defaults are not uncommon
among companies losing money.
   Mack's stock closed down $1.25 at $6.25 per share on the
over-the-counter market Friday.
   ``Mack has borrowed more money than lenders are comfortable with
and they want them to renegotiate the credit lines,'' said Frank
Prezelski, a stock analyst with Deutsche Bank in New York. ``The
bottom line doesn't mean very much. It means only that Mack will
refinance and begin to make money again, hopefully, by the middle
of next year.''
   Prezelski said he is confident the company will succeed.
   ``I don't think there's any reason to think that they will go
bankrupt. The company is in better shape than most people give them
credit for,'' he said.
   The company's largest single stockholder, Renault Vehicules
Industries, has offered to supply short-term loans to Mack as long
as it can renegotiate its other loans to make the requirements less
strict, said Gary McManus, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.

<HEAD>Winnebago Names Conner President, Makes Other Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Winnebago Industries Inc. ended its
experiment in management by committee on Friday, naming Richard
Conner president and chief executive of the company that makes
recreational vehicles and trucks and offers satellite delivery of
television commercials.
   Winnebago, which is trying to recover from a series of losses,
also announced other executive appointments, replacing the
10-person management council that had governed the Forest City
company since September 1988.
   Conner said his task would be ``downsizing'' Winnebago to make
it more efficient, so it could better ride out swings in gasoline
prices and the economy _ two major factors that influence sales of
motor homes.
   He said no layoffs are planned but that the company might reduce
its payroll by not filling all vacancies created by workers leaving
or retiring.
   Efficiencies mostly would come by being more careful with
inventories and getting rid of excess raw material.
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   The appointments were announced by John K. Hanson, Winnebago's
founder and chairman, a day after a vote on the changes by the
company's board of directors.
   The announcement also followed by a day the company's report of
a $4.6 million loss and a 38 percent slide in revenue in the first
quarter of its fiscal year compared with the same period a year
earlier. The loss followed a fourth-quarter sea of red ink, an
$11.3 million loss that was the largest of any quarter in the
company's history.
   Conner said that in addition to strengthening the management
team and moving to control expenses, Winnebago also will try to
turn things around by doing a better job designing and selling its
products.
   The company is financially strong because of its low debt, but
Conner said, ``the strongest thing is the reputation and name.
Winnebago seems to stand for quality and we're going to live up to
that.''
   Conner, 57, has been a member of the company's board since 1985
and was chief executive of Winnebago's Cycle Sat subsidiary since
August. Cycle Sat delivers commercials to television stations by
satellites.
   The election of Conner as president was no surprise. He was
marked for advancement in August when he was elected deputy
chairman of the board to replace John V. Hanson, the founder's son,
who resigned as a director and officer of the company.
   ``I understand he (Conner) gets along with John K. Hanson, which
is a necessary in the job,'' said Frank Rolfes, an analyst who
follows Winnebago for the Minneapolis securities firm of Dain
Bosworth.
   Rolfes said the appointment would help improve Winnebago's image
because ``I don't think anybody likes to see a company run by a
committee.''
   Winnebago stock closed down 25 cents at $5.25 a share in trading
Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The announcement of the new
management team came at the end of the trading day.

<HEAD>Bonds Mostly Lower</HEAD>

   Bond prices were mostly lower Friday as traders
had little response to government data giving further mixed signals
on the economy.
   The U.S. Treasury's 30-year bond fell 1-32 point, or less than
$1 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield was unchanged from
late Thursday at 7.85 percent.
   Analysts said the credit markets shrugged off a Commerce
Department report that the nation's merchandise trade deficit
soared to $10.2 billion in October, a 19.8 percent jump from
September's $8.51 billion imbalance.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department's Producer Price Index dipped
0.1 percent last month following a 0.4 percent gain in October and
a 0.9 percent rise in September.
   Analysts said the producer-price index figure was better than
expected while the trade deficit growth was worse. The reports
negated each other in impact on the credit markets.
   ``The general gist of all the evidence we've had over the entire
week is that we have a pretty sluggish situation in the conomy,''
said Jean Buckley, an economist at BankAmerica Capital Markets
Group in San Francisco.
   ``But there was nothing either great or harmful to get things
moving,'' she said. ``The market is very quiet. There aren't that
many positions in the Street now.''
   Bondholders have welcomed recent news of a slowing economy
because it implies less demand for goods and services, easing the
risk of inflation, which erodes the value of bonds.
   Slower growth also encourages the Federal Reserve to take steps
that would lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Lower
rates make fixed-income investments such as bonds more valuable.
   Economists said they believe the Fed could ease interest rates
next week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term issues were down 1-32 point to 1-16 point,
intermediate-term maturities were 1-16 point to 3-32 point lower,
and long-term issues were unchanged to down 1-32 point, according
to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 0.34 at 1,195.65.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.88 percent as the
discount gained 2 basis points to 7.64 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.78 percent while the discount rose 1 basis point to
7.40 percent. Yields on one-year bills issued at auction Thursday
were at 7.63 percent with the discount off 1 basis points to 7.13
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8{ percent, down from 87-16 percent late
Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 93 23-32, up 1-32 point. The
average yield to maturity was unchanged at 7.24 percent.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit surged to
$10.2 billion in October, the worst imbalance in 10 months, as a
record level of imports swamped a small rise in exports, the
Commerce Department said.
   The October deficit was a sharp 19.8 percent higher than the
September imbalance of $8.51 billion, reflecting a higher foreign
oil bill and big increases in imports of food and industrial
supplies, the government said Friday.

   A sharp drop in gasoline costs helped push
wholesale prices down in November for the third time in five
months, the government reported.
   The annual rate of inflation, as measured by the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index released Friday, was 4.6 percent
for the first 11 months of the year, up from 4 percent for all of
1988 but much lower than was feared earlier this year.
   The index dipped 0.1 percent last month following a 0.4 percent
gain in October and a 0.9 percent spurt in September. It declined
0.5 percent in July and 0.4 percent in August.

   Industrial production was little changed in
November despite rebounding from a major strike and a devastating
earthquake, the government said.
   The Fed attributed the 0.1 percent gain Friday to a rebound from
the Boeing Co. strike and from lingering effects in the computer
and related industries from the San Francisco Bay-area earthquake
in October, when output slumped 0.6 percent.

   Eastman Kodak Co. said costs related to a
restructuring announced this year would reduce fourth quarter
earnings by $273 million, significantly more than the company had
predicted.
   The $273 million charge Friday brings Kodak's total 1989
restructuring costs to $500 million, or $850 million before taxes,
spokesman Henry Kaska said. The photography giant had charged $227
million against its second quarter earnings.
   Kodak had estimated earlier this year that fourth quarter
charges would be lower than those in the second quarter.

   Media giant Knight-Ridder Inc. expects to post
higher earnings this year and that savings from its
recently-enacted newspaper joint operating agreement in Detroit
will boost 1990 earnings.
   Tribune Co., meanwhile, said Friday it expects a profit increase
for 1989 but said earnings growth would be more difficult to
achieve in 1990 due to impending labor negotiations, slow
advertising revenue growth and weak newsprint prices.
   New York Times Co. said a gain on the sale of its cable
operations would mean record 1989 earnings, but earnings from
continuing operations _ excluding the cable sale gain _ would be
down substantially. It expects higher earnings in 1990 excluding
the cable sale gain.

   The brokerage firm Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. has agreed to pay a $100,000 fine and be censured for stock
pricing violations following the 1987 market crash, the National
Association of Securities Dealers said Friday.
   In addition, Prudential-Bache ``made adjustments'' of
$235,901.50 in the prices customers paid in connection with the
questioned transactions, the association said in a statement.
   In settling the matter, Prudential-Bache neither admitted nor
denied the allegations, the statement said.
   The association's market surveillance committee said
Prudential-Bache received sell orders involving 20 securities for
which it was the market maker on Oct. 19, 1987, but failed to
complete the sales while the market was open.
   It said the firm subsequently bought the securities from the
customers at prices that were at least 8 percent below the lowest
reported price of the day.
   As a result, the committee said the 186 customer accounts
placing the sell orders received $235,901.50 less than what they
would have received had the orders been executed at the lowest
price of the day.
   The allegations involve activities on Black Monday when the Dow
Jones industrial average plunged 508 points in its biggest one-day
loss ever.
   Prudential-Bache was unable to execute the trades until after
the close of the market because of the extraordinary market
conditions.
   But the association said that the firm had access before it made
the deals to information that indicated the intra-day trading range
for these securities.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is a
self-regulatory organization for the over-the-counter markets. Its
surveillance committee is responsible for maintaining the integrity
of those markets.

<TEXT>
   Debt-ridden Circle K Corp. on Friday reported
that it has arranged short-term debt relief in an attempt to get
ahead of its interest payments.
   Company spokesman Ray Cox said the new agreement was made
possible when a syndicate of banks waived compliance with the
required-profit-level covenants covering Circle K's $325 million
credit agreement. The company has drawn on $260 million, Cox said.
   In addition, Circle K received a $60 million, 100-day extension
of credit, he said.
   Cox also announced a $4.99 million loss, amounting to 16 cents
per share, for the second quarter of its 1990 fiscal year.
   In the Aug. 1-Oct. 31 period, Circle K had revenues of $937.2
million, Cox said.
   Last year, the company reported a $13.30 million profit, or 25
cents per fully diluted share, on sales of $851.67 million.
   Part of the loss stemmed from a $2.2 million charge in the
company's failed attempts to find a buyer for itself. Circle K
began the effort in May and abandoned it several months ago after
Chairman Karl Eller decided not to bid on a buyout.
   Cox added that the operating results also included an after-tax
loss of just over $1 million for its 50 percent share of a joint
venture in the United Kingdom.
   Cox's secretary said he was unavailable for comment on the
status of the corporation, which last month announced a
restructuring that includes refinancing of debt, a salary freeze,
layoffs and the sale of up to 590 stores deemed unprofitable.
   On Dec. 7, Circle 7 announced a Dec. 15 deadline to get ahead of
its debt service with $20 million in credit.
   It said the banks which are part of its revolving-credit
agreement agreed to make $10 million available, and American
Financial Corp., Circle K's largest stockholder, agreed to advance
the same amount.
   The new agreement includes the banks, American Financial and
``certain issuers of letters of credit (which) ... have consented
to refrain from taking actions to reduce their extensions of credit
during the term of the short-term agreement,'' Cox said in his
statement.
   The covenants apply to $200 million in senior secured notes due
Oct. 15, 1993. They require Circle K to maintain at the end of each
quarter a minimum fixed-coverage ratio for the preceding 12 months,
Cox said.
   ``Funds to make such payment are not presently available to the
company,'' Cox said.
   He said failure to meet the profit levels or negotiate the
agreement struck late Friday would have forced the company to buy
back $20 million of the long-term debt.
   According to company figures, Circle K has long-term debt of
about $1.1 billion, up from $844 million the year before, and paid
$96 million in interest and debt expenses during the 1989 fiscal
year.
   The company's financial woes followed explosive expansion which
saw Circle K grow from about 1,000 convenience stores in 1984 to a
high of 4,685. The financial statement Friday said the total had
dropped to 4,677.
   The company owns about 12 percent of the stores; the others are
franchised.
