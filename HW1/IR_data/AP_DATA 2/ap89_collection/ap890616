   The Army on Friday released the names of the
three U.S. soldiers killed when the military helicopter they were
flying crashed in Panama.
   Two men were identified by the Pentagon: Warrant Officer Brian L.
Madrid of Bessemer, Pa. and Chief Warrant Officer Steven K. Cornick
of Santa Cruz, Calif.
   At Ford Ord, Calif. officials identified the third man as Staff
Sgt. Timothy E. McDaniel of Anchorage, Alaska.
   The two officers were members of the 123rd Aviation Battalion of
the 7th Infantry Division based at Ford Ord, and McDaniel was a
member of the Army's Combat Pictorial Detachment at Fort Meade, Md.,
officials said.
   An investigation into the cause of the crash was under way, said
a Pentagon spokeswoman, Maj. Kathy Wood. The cause of the crash
appeared to be a mechanical failure, she said, and U.S. officials
earlier had ruled out the possibility that the helicopter was fired
upon.
   The helicopter, an OH-58 small observation craft, crashed near
the Trans-Isthmian Highway as it was flying a mission for a military
convoy traveling from Fort Clayton, on the Pacific side of the
Canal, to Fort Sherman, on the Atlantic.
   The U.S. Southern Command in Panama announced that the helicopter
went down near the town of Chilibre, about 21 miles north of Panama
City.
   The battalion was among troops sent to Panama following the
government's nullification of the May 7 elections and post-election
violence in which three opposition candidates were beaten.

   Eleven-year-old California pilot Tony
Aliengena, who hopes to fly to the Soviet Union and around the
world, landed his Cessna 210 Centurion plane in Greenland on Friday.
   Tony's plane and two accompanying aircraft touched down at Sondre
Stromfjord airport in west Greenland Friday afternoon after a
four-hour North Atlantic flight from Frobisher Bay, Canada.
   ``Tony's pretty tired and I hope he can get a few hours sleep
before we take off for Iceland in two hours time,'' said the boy's
father, Gary Aliengena.
   The main destination of Tony's ``Friendship Flight `89'' is the
Soviet Union, where he plans to deliver letters from American
schoolchildren to Soviet kids in Leningrad and Moscow.
   From Moscow, Tony and his Dad, along with family members, Russian
reporters, a filmmaker and an observer from the National Aeronautic
Association in two other aircraft, are scheduled to fly across the
Soviet Union and the Bering Strait to Alaska and finally home to
Southern California.
   Before that they plan to visit Rekjavik, Iceland, Oslo, Norway,
Stockholm, Sweden and Helsinki, Finland.
   The 11-year old hopes to become the youngest pilot to fly around
the world, a 19,000-mile trip by the route he is taking.

   Brushing aside a homelessness protest, storms and
a last-minute legal scare, officials Thursday opened Underground
Atlanta, a $142 million attempt to transform the business district
into Fun City South.
   Wind and rain forced the opening ceremony to be moved to a
covered section of the complex and prevented a fireworks display.
But people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder to get a first-day look at
the more than 100 shops, restaurants, nightclubs and street vendors.
   Police estimated that about 200,000 people visited through the
day.
   Mayor Andrew Young's speech capping the opening ceremony was
drowned out by demonstrators blowing whistles and chanting,
``Atlanta keeps the homeless underground.'' Six people were arrested
and charged with criminal trespassing, police said.
   About an hour before the complex opened, Superior Court Judge
Isaac Jenrette refused to stop the developers from using the
Underground Atlanta name. He ruled that a company that claims it
holds rights to the name filed a lawsuit too late.
   Underground Atlanta adds entertainment and nightlife to a
downtown that had lost most of its fun spots to the suburbs.
   First-day visitors appeared to be enjoying themselves, and many
said they'd be coming back.
   ``The shops are fantastic. I've done my Christmas shopping
already,'' said Sharon Brewer of Tuscon, Ariz., who was in Atlanta
to visit a friend.
   But even the most enthusiastic merchants acknowledged success is
uncertain.
   An original Underground Atlanta, located beneath downtown street
viaducts, opened in 1969. Hurt by nearby subway construction and the
perception that it was crime-ridden, it closed in 1982.
   Young made reviving Underground a priority of his administration,
and with a combination of private investment, millions of dollars of
municipal funds and the issuance of $85 million in revenue bonds,
the project thrived. Developed over three years by The Rouse
Company, the new Underground is located on and around the old site.
   Advocates for the homeless say many of the city's street people
were displaced by the Underground construction, and that public
money used for the complex could have gone to providing affordable
housing.
   When Young was drowned out by the demonstrators, he angrily
defended his administration's actions on behalf of the poor.
Dignitaries on the stand, including Gov. Joe Frank Harris, rose to
applaud the mayor but the protesters shouted even louder.
   Young, a liberal Democrat who was prominent in the civil rights
movement, said later he was not angry with the hecklers but insisted
he didn't deserve their ire.
   ``You protest when you can't get people to take you seriously or
talk with you,'' Young said. ``I meet with the homeless, we have a
homeless task force, we put all of the resources we possibly can in
dealing with the problems of homelessness.
   ``Maybe this helps in the sense that it puts homelessness on the
national media,'' he added. ``But you're not going to be able to
resolve the problems of homelessness unless we keep successful
projects like this going that create jobs.''
   Murphy Davis, a partner at the Open Door Community, an
organization that aids the homeless, said of the demonstration, ``I
think it's a hard thing for a lot of people to understand _ why
disrupt a good time? But there are a lot of people in this city who
never have a good time because the basics of life are denied to
them.''
   Ms. Davis said that if Underground Atlanta provides jobs to the
poor, they are likely to be paid the minimum wage, which she said is
not enough money to live on.

<TEXT>
   In a startling first for the largest
winemaker in the world, the E.&amp; J. Gallo Winery said it will stop
for six months the sale of its its two brands of cheap high-alcohol
wine in the seedy Tenderloin district.
   The action came Wednesday after Tenderloin-area distributor
Gallo-Bay Cities, a Gallo-owned business, met with ``Safe and Sober
Streets'' activists, who have protested the sale of the fortified
wines in their district.
   ``If what we have done in this neighborhood improves the
alcoholism problem in this area, we'll do the same thing in other
neighborhoods,'' said Dan Solomon, a spokesman for the Modesto-based
winery.
   The protesters denounced fortified wines like Gallo's Thunderbird
and Night Train Express, and Canandaigua's Wild Irish Rose. They
said they were unable to walk through the Tenderloin without
tripping over or being menaced by a wino.
   Gallo has never removed a product from the shelves, Solomon said.
The privately held company has $1 billion in annual sales and 28
percent of the U.S. wine market.
   Sober Streets group went from grocery-to-grocery, trying to
persuade the proprietors to take the cheap goods off their shelves.
One grocer agreed but changed his mind, he said, after losing $850
in wine sales in a single day.
   Solomon characterized the action as an experiment by Gallo to see
whether or not ``our beliefs and the evidence are correct'' _ that
winos deprived of their cheap wine will turn to other alcohols.
   The wines involved are typically made from the cheapest vinous
ingredients and the merest hint of grape flavor, then hyped with
grape brandy to bring the alcohol to about 18 percent by volume.
They sell for around 90 cents to $1.25 a bottle.
   It's estimated that the two wines account for less than 3 percent
of company sales.

   An judge changed his mind about not paying a
12-member jury, which he dismissed without pay for ignoring his
instructions in a personal injury case.
   Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Silvestri Silvestri on
Thursday authorized payments to the panel for five days of work
after meeting with judges Paul Zavarella and Ralph Cappy, who
administer the civil division.
   ``It was his order and he reconsidered it,'' Zavarella said.
   Silvestri refused to comment on why he changed his mind.
   ``With all the publicity on the case, I think Judge Silvestri
just wants the matter to end,'' Zavarella said.
   Jurors normally are paid $9 a day for the first three days of a
trial and $25 for each day therafter, plus mileage. The jurors will
receive between $82 and $112.
   One of the jurors, Benjamin Margolin, wrote Silvestri asking him
to reconsider his decision, saying the jury was ``not fully
cognizant of the law.''
   ``I for one am sorry it caused such a furor,'' he said.
   Silvestri had tried twice, without success, to explain to the
jurors that they had to award $10,514 in medical expenses to
Christopher Culver, a Carnegie Mellon University student whose ankle
had been broken in an impromptu wrestling match initiated by another
student in 1987 at a fraternity party.
   In their first verdict, the jury decided not to award money
damages to Culver, 21, of Pittsburgh. After Silvestri repeated his
instructions, they deliberated again and awarded the injured student
$1,000, but because they ruled both men were 50 percent responsible,
the student was to receive $500.
   Silvestri then dismissed them without pay on June 1.

<HEAD>Homosexual Congregation Breaks Ground by Joining Mainline Church</HEAD>

   Though churches have condemned homosexual
activity for centuries, gay men and women are beginning to find a
home within a mainline Christian denomination.
   The Spirit of the Lakes Ecumenical Community Church became the
nation's first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline
church when it was accepted into membership of the United Church of
Christ in April, according to its leader.
   ``As far as we know, we're making history,'' said the Rev. Dan
Geslin, pastor of Spirit of the Lakes. ``We see ourselves as a
prophetic voice.
   ``We hope that we're breaking ground and leading the way for
other churches and other denominations to open up and recognize gay
and lesbian people's rightful place in the church.''
   Spirit of the Lakes has grown from 18 people meeting in a living
room in May 1987 to 150 members. It was voted into membership by
more than 80 percent of the delegates attending the annual meeting
of the Eastern Association, the largest of the United Church of
Christ's three associations in Minnesota with 71 churches and 24,000
members.
   Spirit of the Lakes is considered a ``developing'' church while
the association reviews the group's constitution and development
plan. Those are likely to be approved at the association's 1990
annual meeting, formalizing the congregation's admission,
association officials say.
   Samuel Loliger, co-coordinator of the United Church Coalition for
Lesbian-Gay Concerns, an Athens, Ohio-based special-interest group
within the church, said the acceptance of Spirit of the Lakes is a
first for mainline denominations.
   ``This one is certainly very different than anything we have
encountered before,'' he said. ``It is an openly gay and lesbian
congregation, and they have sought to become a church with that
right up front.''
   Most Christian churches accept homosexuals as members, equally
beloved by God as others, but condemn the practice of homosexuality.
   But the United Church of Christ, a 1.8-million-member Protestant
church formed in 1957 when the Evangelical and Reformed Church
merged with the Congregational Christian Churches, often has been at
the forefront of progressive social movements.
   In 1969, the church's general synod approved its first resolution
supporting civil rights for homosexuals, and three years later it
became the first mainline denomination to ordain an openly gay
minister.
   In 1983, the general synod passed a resolution stating that ``a
person's sexual orientation is not a moral issue'' and that sexual
orientation should not be the basis for discrimination within the
church. The synod encouraged United Church of Christ churches to
openly accept homosexuals as members.
   That inclusiveness is what attracted Spirit of the Lakes to the
denomination.
   Geslin, 39, who grew up in Anoka, a Minneapolis suburb, received
a master of divinity degree from the Pacific School of Religion, a
United Church of Christ-affiliated school in Berkeley, Calif. He
took over as pastor of Spirit of the Lakes in September and
immediately began pursuing membership in the denomination.
   ``The discussion was, `Why bother to affiliate at all?' Most
(homosexuals) look at established churches as oppressive
institutions,'' Geslin said.
   But the membership was attracted by the United Church of Christ's
structure, which allows autonomy for each congregation.
   ``This is the best of both worlds for us,'' he said. ``We can
remain an autonomous congregation ... and still associate with a
larger Christian body. That allows us to be a community of
gay-lesbian Christians and at the same time not be ghetto-ized.''
   He described the congregation as college-educated professionals
who come from Catholic, Lutheran and Episcopal backgrounds and are
interested in social justice, peace, liberation and feminist
theology.
   Although Spirit of the Lakes has generally met with quiet
acceptance, some have voiced reservations.
   ``I do not think that any congregation should come in with a
sexual or a racial orientation,'' said the Rev. James McCutcheon,
senior minister of the United Church of Christ-affiliated Wayzata
Community Church. ``I would be bothered if somebody proposed a
church just for men, or a church just for women, or a church just
for married couples, and so on.''
   Geslin says 10 percent of his church's membership is heterosexual.
   Spirit of the Lakes also is bucking Christian tradition which
holds that the practice of homosexuality is a sin.
   People who interpret the Bible literally point to several Old and
New Testament passages that appear to condemn homosexuality. One is
Leviticus 20:13, which according to the Revised Standard Version
says, ``If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have
committed an abomination.''
   But Geslin and McCutcheon contend that the Bible must be
interpreted in the context of the time in which it was written.
   When Leviticus was written, Geslin said, ``the Israelites were
instinctively concerned with maximizing the probabilities of
procreation. Religious laws governing sexual practices reinforced
that basic tribal concern.''
   Geslin criticizes people who use specific Bible verses to condemn
homosexuals today.
   ``It's not taking the Bible as a whole,'' he said. ``It's picking
out little bits and pieces to justify cultural prejudices.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``time tunnel'' is the visual and
philosophical centerpiece of the Berlin Opera's Ring cycle at the
Kennedy Center for Performing Arts.
   The concept creates a thrilling sensation that everything
happening on stage in the present is part of the past and part of
the future.
   Richard Wagner's stunning creation, ``Der Ring des Nibelungen''
(``The Ring of the Nibelungen'' _ dwarfs who owned a magic ring and
a horde of gold), is being performed the way the German composer
intended it to be _ a four-day cycle.
   The Metropolitan Opera performed the entire epic about love and
greed and gods and goddesses in April and May. It was the first time
it had been presented in so short a span in 90 years. The Kennedy
Center ring opened June 2.
   In all four of Berlin's Ring operas, ``Das Rheingold,'' ``Die
Walkure,'' ``Siegfried'' and ``Gotterdammerung,'' the audience looks
into the end of a tunnel designed by Peter Sykora. The other end is
straight ahead, far away and smaller, with a light beyond.
   This doesn't mean that singers just stride around inside an
otherwise hollow tunnel. Sometimes there are sufficient backdrops,
scenery and props so that only two pieces of the 90-foot-high
stucture's mouth are visible, curving across the top of the stage on
both sides.
   The Kennedy Center's Ring is intensely theatrical. Characters
move a lot; laser light flashes; fire juts up from grates in some
dozen dark circles on the stage; fog pours from 20 fog machines; the
flamboyantly feathered forest bird glides in on a swing instead of
being an unseen voice.
   Gotz Friedrich staged the Ring for the company he has headed
since 1981. The Ring, he said, concerns power, money and love. Its
characters, and its viewers try to find solutions and a better way
for the next generation. ``But they do the same errors again,'' he
said.
   After Alberich steals the gold from the Rhinemaidens and sets the
Nibelungs, now his slaves, to mine more gold, his office slides
onstage _ six TV sets for overseeing the work, computers behind him,
an electronic console in front of him.
   The mythic story, in which Wagner thought human truth could be
found, begins with Alberich, a dwarf who yearns for love, invading
the territory of the Rheinmaidens who lead him on and then spurn
him, making him so angry he renounces love and steals their gold. It
ends with the death of the superhero Siegfried and Brunnhilde's
throwing herself on his funeral pyre, her love redeeming the world.
In between is plenty of theft, betrayal and murder.
   Ring lovers are divided over how their beloved opera should be
staged. Some prefer the naturalistic setting with the Valkyries'
rock looking like a mountain top, as used by the Metropolitan and
San Francisco operas, rather than Ring cycles staged according to a
director's concept. Since Wagner's grandson staged an abstract Ring
in 1965, directorial ``interpretations'' have been the norm in
Europe.
   Friedrich, general director of the Berlin Opera, and set designer
Sykora created this Ring in 1986. Its Kennedy Center performances
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Federal Republic of Germany.
   ``When the Ring was first completed and performed in Bayreuth in
1876, Wagner said in the next year he would change everything,''
Friedrich said in an interview. ``He saw ... that what he wrote in
his score about the scenes was bad. But in his lifetime, it never
came to a new production. The tradition carried almost 80 years.''
   The Berlin production was moving, as the Ring visually flowed
like the silk cloth it lavishly used among present, past and future.
The curved rafters in the tunnel looked like staves in a huge
winecask in a Bruegel painting, but the entrances into the wings
from the tunnel were metal, like submarine hatches. The armored
dragon slain by Siegfried moves forward like a tank, with a
searchlight between glowing red eyes. After it is pierced by
Siegfried's sword, it collapses onto one wheel.
   With love so important in the Ring, Friedrich has added a bit of
love interest not in the original text involving a giant and the
goddess Freia.
   Friedrich also has Vietnam War images in the Ring, starting with
the second opera, ``Die Walkure.'' Weapons, ancient and modern,
khaki and camouflage cloth abound. In ``Siegfried,'' the third
opera, the Wanderer dresses like a Vietnam War correspondent in long
trench coat.
   Siegfried wears bib overalls to convey innocence, even after he
weds Brunnhilde. It's only when he meets Gunther, king of the
Gibichungs, who is dressed like a Marine officer, and his
sophisticated sister that Siegfried changes to slacks and blazer.
   Trap doors aren't used in this production. When Erda comes up
from inside the earth, she sits up out of a silk cloth which covers
the stage. Four silk cloths are lifted and lowered by wires to make
the waves in ``Das Rheingold.''
   Valhalla isn't prominent either. When the gods first see it, it
is small and distant. When it is destroyed at the end of the Ring, a
few fragments fall from the ceiling.
   The Ring's ending usually is taken to mean that the status quo _
gods in the sky, giants and heroes on earth and Nibelungs, who are
miners and blacksmiths, below the earth _ is destroyed and will be
replaced by a better system.
   Friedrich's idea is that history will repeat itself. The last
image in ``Gotterdammerung'' is the same as the beginning of ``Das
Rheingold'' _ people covered with a huge white silk cloth.
   Some details weren't immediately understandable, as having Loge,
god of fire, dressed like a Wild West gambler, the earth goddess
swimming offstage and the Gibichung king in whiteface.
   Musically, the Berlin Opera Orchestra isn't as flexible, balanced
or strong as the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. It is good but often
doesn't rise to the high points and sometimes sounds tired. Jesus
Lopez-Cobos, the company's music director, conducted the first Ring
and Christof Perick conducted the second.
   Great Wagnerian voices are nearly as scarce as heros such as
Siegfried. This production is blessed with Gunter von Kannen, who
sang Alberich, and Matti Salminen, who sang Hagen in both cycles
and, in the second cycle, also sang one of the giants in ``Das
Rheingold'' and Sieglinde's husband in ``Die Walkure.''
   Rene Kollo, probably the world's current best Siegfried, sang
with beauty and without strain. Simon Estes showcased his rich voice
as Wotan in the second cycle.

   As soon as a stone landed near
his car, patrol leader Meishe Mishkan hit the brakes, popped a clip
of 25-rounds into his Uzi submachine gun and led other Jewish
settlers on a chase of a dozen Arab teen-agers.
   Moments later, a short, chubby settler with a white, knitted
skullcap was stoned from a rooftop. ``I'm under attack,'' he yelled,
crouching low, pivoting on one foot and raking a nearby rooftop with
bullets.
   No one was hurt in Wednesday's clash. But the controversial
settler patrols of the occupied lands have spurred accusations the
settlers are taking too much of the law into their own hands.
   The organizer of the Wednesday patrol, Bella Gonen, said the
settlers began the patrols in April after losing faith in the
Israeli army's ability to end the 18-month Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule.
   ``The army is becoming more like a group of United Nations
observers,'' said Ms. Gonen of Kiryat Arba, a settlement of 4,700
Jews that overlooks Hebron, a city with 50,000 Arabs. ``They don't
protect the Jews, all they do is separate the two sides.''
   Army officials have ordered the settlers to end their patrols in
Palestinian areas. ``It's illegal and each time the army comes
across such a patrol it's dispersed immediately,'' a spokesman said.
   Israeli civilians, most often settlers, were involved in the
shooting deaths of 19 of the 516 Palestinians killed since the
uprising began. Twenty-two Israelis also have died, including six
settlers.
   Gonen said Kiryat Arba settlers began car patrols this week,
which they officially refer to as ``archaeological expeditions'' to
circumvent official objections.
   Wednesday's patrol slowly cruised through the winding streets of
Hebron for about a half-hour until the stone landed near Mishkan's
car outside the Islamic University campus.
   During the clash, Yaakov Ben-David, a tall, thin man in his 20s
who is a Moslem convert to Judiasm, carefully took aim before
letting loose with a burst of three rounds. ``They're rounding the
stone wall,'' he shouted as he charged up a hill.
   Other settlers stood behind him, firing their Uzis at the
Palestinians who were running up the hill, behind a wall. Sharp pops
could be heard as the bullets ricocheted off the stones.
   The encounter lasted about three minutes, after which the
settlers withdrew to their cars and the Arab teens stood on a stone
wall beyond gunfire range, chanting Palestinian slogans and flashing
``V'' for victory signs.
   ``The problem here is the media. If we chase them and run into
their homes, the press will go crazy and attack us. We can't do
anything here,'' said settler David Cohen as he climbed into his
mud-spattered blue car and rolled up the reinforced glass windows.
   ``We are not shooting to kill, but if we hit one, well...'' said
the driver, Gilon Ben-Said, shrugging his shoulders.
   As he drove away, Ben-Said broke into a chorus of the song, ``Am
Yisrael Hai'' _ ``The Nation of Israel Lives.'' Army troops arrived
as the settler convoy pulled out, firing tear gas between the
Palestinians and the departing settlers.
   Ten minutes later, the group pulled up to the grave of the
biblical prophet Nathan in the nearby Arab town of Halhoul.
   Zvi Katzover, deputy chairman of Kiryat Arba's town council,
chastised his men for firing so freely and warned them to hold their
fire if there was another confrontation.
   ``If we start shooting and other people are chasing, someone
could end up with a bullet in his back,'' he said.
   As Katzover finished speaking, two jeeploads of soldiers pulled
up. The commanding officer, a major, demanded the settlers leave the
area. A jeep with paramilitary border police escorted the settlers
to the gates of Kiryat Arba.
   Later, settlers held a town meeting with a local army commander,
Col. Baruch. Under military regulations, his last name may not be
revealed.
   The meeting was scheduled following several incidents of
vigilante raids on Arab villages in reprisal for stone-throwing and
confrontations with troops in which one officer was beaten.
   A tall, husky man wearing a bush hat and a pistol holster with
extra clips of ammunition attached to its side stood up and said:
``I support a family of 10. What am I suppose to do if I am
attacked, call the army and wait?''
   Col. Baruch, who patiently jotted down each settler's question
during a half-hour session, responded in a slow, controlled voice:
   ``No one can promise you that there will be no stones thrown in
Judea and Samaria (West Bank.)''
   ``But in no instance can people take the law into their own
hands. The best way for us to act is for people to let the army do
its job,'' he said.

<HEAD>Beijing Crisis Sparks Fear Among Chinese Students Around the World</HEAD>

   Chinese students abroad are trying to extend their
stays in their host countries because of the crisis in their
homeland, which has turned thousands of exchange students into
potential exiles.
   The Chinese government's violent suppression of a student-led
reform movement has sent a shiver around the world, instilling fear
in some students who had hoped to return home and hope in others who
want to stay abroad.
   Since the June 3-4 military attack on unarmed students in
Beijing, governments have said they would extend the visas of
Chinese students. Among those are the United States, Japan, Canada
and the 12-nation European Economic Community.
   In Australia, the Immigration Department said it had received
10,000 inquiries from Chinese students _ virtually all of the 10,600
registered in the country _ about extending their visas.
   Only a few have actually applied, said immigration spokeswoman
Jenny Hoskin. ``But we expect a great deal more in coming weeks.''
   ``We would consider sympathetically the case of any student who
could be considered in any sense in danger by returning to China,''
Prime Minister Bob Hawke said Thursday, assuring students in
Australia they need not worry about their visas lapsing and being
deported.
   In Beijing, statistics show about 80,000 Chinese now are studying
abroad, with half of them in the United States, according to the
Returned Student Association.
   They were permitted to leave China only after passing competitive
examinations. Rules published in 1987 said they had to show they
``love the motherland and cherish socialism.'' Political reliability
and family connections _ relatives in China to ensure their return _
are important.
   Abroad, many students hope to keep alive the pro-democracy
movement. But distance from the tensions in China has not allayed
fears of government reprisals. In several countries, students say
they believe they are being monitored and harassed by Chinese
authorities.
   At Brandeis University near Boston, mathematician Cheng Mo, 26,
said he suspected the Chinese government was responsible for taking
down posters after a meeting of Chinese students.
   In Japan, a Chinese student who asked not to be identified said
diplomats had photographed demonstrations outside the Chinese
Embassy in Tokyo.
   ``Although they couldn't possibly identify everyone, many of us
are worrying,'' he said.
   Another student in Japan, also asking anonymity, said
pro-democracy activists have toned down the optimism they felt two
weeks ago.
   ``It looks like the battle will be a long one,'' he said. ``None
of us wants to do anything conspicuous. But we will continue to
fight. Maybe publish a magazine or something. We won't make any
needless sacrifices.''
   Some Chinese even want to move to Taiwan, where the mainland's
old rulers fled after the communist revolution.
   Taiwan's de facto embassy in Tokyo said 200 Chinese students had
picked up applications for Taiwanese passports and 20 had submitted
them in the last four days.
   In London, the Free Chinese Center, which represents the Taiwan
government in Britain, has received several dozen applications for
citizenship ``and we expect more to come,'' said spokesman Kate
Hanniker.
   The Taiwanese government announced last week it would relax its
rules and issue Taiwan passports to Chinese students who had
pariticipated in rallies in other countries supporting the
demonstrators in Beijing.
   ``This is to show our concern for overseas mainland students. We
hope our passports will help them complete their studies in foreign
countries,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman Chen Yu-chu in Taipei.
   But holding a Taiwan passport will not guarantee permanent
residence in Nationalist China, he said, because the country's laws
say mainland Chinese must live four years in a free country to be
eligible for entrance and residence on the island.
   The Taiwanese Education Ministry has proposed offering financial
help to mainland Chinese studying in other countries.
   Some of the 3,000 Chinese students in Britain have expressed
worry that their financing ends this summer, said Dr. Abraham Lue,
assistant principal of Kings College in London.
   ``And so they are worried that if the situation in China prevails
and it's hazardous for them to return, then they're going to find it
difficult to find funding and to stay on here longer,'' he told the
BBC.
   Some Chinese students in the United States fear they will be
jailed if they return home, said Ding Xueliang, 36, a Harvard
University student who was active in the democracy movement in exile.
   ``We'll continue to speak out,'' Ding said. ``It could cause more
trouble, but our moral obligation is to help our friends in China.''
   In Denmark, seven Chinese students and two businessmen have
applied for asylum since the crackdown in Beijing, said Inge
Thomsen, a department head in the Aliens Directorate. She said
Danish authorities would be cautious in forcing any Chinese to
return to China under the present circumstances.

<HEAD>Black Elected Officials in Alabama Accuse Federal Agents of Harassment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stung by a series of corruption
allegations, black leaders across Alabama are accusing federal
authorities of racial harassment, but one U.S. attorney says he and
his colleagues are ``equal-opportunity prosecutors.''
   Richard Arrington, a former college professor serving his third
term as Birmingham's first black mayor, said federal agents tried to
frame him through a developer who faces tax bribery charges, and
other black officials say their phones have been tapped or they have
been the target of unjustified investigations.
   At Arrington's request, a special state prosecutor has been named
to review the actions of the federal agents, and the federal
government's own office that investigates bias allegations against
law enforcement authorities is looking into the matter. The Senate
Judiciary Committee staff is also reviewing the allegations.
   Blacks in Alabama began flexing ballot box strength after passage
of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and now hold more than 1,000 elective
offices in the state, including 24 of the 141 seats in the Alabama
Legislature.
   Three black legislators from the Birmingham area are under
indictment on federal charges they tried to bribe a former
legislator, who is white, in connection with a proposed dog track.
Their attorneys contend race bias was a factor that led to their
indictment.
   Thomas Reed, the state NAACP president, was convicted of federal
bribery charges in September and stripped of his seat in the state
House. He was accused of accepting $10,000 to use his influence to
get early parole for a convicted killer. Reed contends his
prosecution was spurred by his high profile opposition to the flying
of the Confederate flag atop the Capitol.
   Those cases, and reports of FBI surveillance of other blacks,
amount to selective harassment, according to Arrington and others.
   Fred Gray, a black attorney who is a veteran of the civil rights
movement, said the actions are part of a pattern that began with
President Reagan's arrival at the White House eight years ago and
continues under President Bush.
   ``All of this is a conspiracy on the part of the administration
to destroy black leadership and black political power,'' Gray said.
   State Sen. Hank Sanders, a Democrat, claims that more than half
the black elected officials in the state are under investigation or
surveillance.
   But U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson of Montgomery said the Justice
Department is colorblind.
   ``We're equal-opportunity prosecutors,'' he said. ``We'll
prosecute any crook in the district, any time.''
   At Birmingham, U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson said the harassment
accusations were too absurd to deserve comment.
   As for Sanders' claim that half of the black officials are
targets of some kind of investigation, ``It doesn't ring true to
me,'' said Gerald Shockley, an FBI spokesman.
   At Arrington's request, state Attorney General Don Siegelman
named a special prosecutor to investigate actions of the FBI and the
Internal Revenue Service. Arrington said he wanted a determination
of whether agents ``engaged in criminal solicitation, conspiracy,
attempted bribery and-or obstruction'' of Birmingham's government.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., a member of the U.S. Senate Judiciary
Committee, said Wednesday that the panel's staff is making a
preliminary investigation and a decision will be made later on
whether to refer the matter to the full committee.
   The assistant counsel for the Office of Professional
Responsibility in Washington, David Bobzien, said he and an
investigator will visit Birmingham next week to conduct interviews
in response to a request by Arrington's attorney.
   Bobzien's office was created in 1975 to look into complaints
about employees of the Justice Department and other investigative
agencies.
   It was disclosed this week that Arrington has been a subject of
FBI scrutiny at various times dating back to 1972 when he was a city
councilman supporting blacks alleging police brutality.
   The FBI investigated Arrington for possible bribery and financial
conflicts of interest involving his business partners but no charges
have been filed. The mayor was interviewed by the FBI in 1985.
   A report Thursday in the Birmingham Post-Herald also said that a
new series of court-sanctioned FBI wiretaps has been used to monitor
the telephone conversations of at least two members of the Jefferson
County legislative delegation, Reps. John Rogers and Pat Davis.
   FBI wiretaps were used last year in the investigation that led to
the indictments in the dog track case.
   FBI spokesman Tom Moore declined to comment on the latest
wiretaps.
   ``I have been operating on the assumption that the phone was
tapped,'' Rogers said. ``I resent the investigation. I haven't done
anything.''
   Mark Polson, a lawyer representing Ms. Davis, said he did not
have ``the foggiest idea'' why her phone was tapped but says it is
``more than a coincidence that it is the black politicians who are
catching all the heat.''

   A half dozen 8-year-olds sat
on the floor of a makeshift classroom in this West Bank village and
leafed through a science book on animals. Some drew Palestinian
flags in the margins, but none could read the simple text.
   ``If they were in school, they'd be able to read by now,'' said
Najah Mahmoud, the children's 15-year-old teacher. ``I'm trying to
get them to memorize some words, but it just isn't enough.''
   Illiteracy is growing among the West Bank's 230,000 elementary
school children, who have been deprived of an education for 16
months as a result of Israel's closure of schools. Classrooms have
remained empty for all but a few weeks since Feb. 3, 1988.
   Israeli authorities say they closed the West Bank's 1,194
schools, including 145 kindergartens, because they were breeding
grounds for violent protests during the 18-month Palestinian
uprising. Fifteen schools in the Gaza Strip also have been closed,
but the army has not shut down the entire system.
   Israel has come under increasing international pressure,
including a call from U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, to
end what many consider a collective punishment and to reopen classes
when the closure order comes up for renewal on Monday.
   ``We would like to see the schools open but without an escalation
of violence and without an increase in danger that children would be
injured in the process. That's our concern, and Mr. Baker's concern,
as well,'' Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said in an interview.
   To try to keep students from falling too far behind, Palestinians
have been running underground classes in more than 100 West Bank
towns and villages in defiance of army orders outlawing such
alternative education.
   The lessons are taught in unused buildings, mosques, churches or
even in the open air, shaded by a tree. But, according to Arab
educators, these so-called ``people's schools'' have produced mixed
results.
   ``The problem we face now is illiteracy,'' said Khalil Mahshi,
principal of the Quaker-run Friends School in Ramallah. ``Instead of
consolidating reading skills at ages 7 to 9, we are dealing with
children as old as 9 years old who are illiterate.''
   Malashi said some children from poorer families, who have taken
on unskilled jobs to supplement meager family incomes, may become
permanent dropouts. And wealthy Palestinians, concerned about the
educational prospects for their children, are leaving for the United
States and Europe.
   ``Long term, the community is going to pay a price at the level
of development, production and skilled manpower. This is the biggest
asset of any society,'' he said.
   The second-graders studying in a cramped one-room stone house in
Kafr Ein, a village of 1,000 about 25 miles north of Jerusalem,
spent a recent science class drawing pictures of donkeys, chickens
and camels.
   Samir, a dark-eyed 7-year-old, carefully sketched two outlawed
Palestinian flags onto the hump of his camel. ``I'd like to be able
to read. It is important,'' he said in a small, serious voice.
``Instead, I can draw a Palestinian flag.''
   Grades one through six in Kafr Ein study two hours each day,
doubling up two classes at a time on opposite sides of the room.
There are no classes for the upper grades, and the only teaching
materials in evidence were two tattered primary-level science books,
some colored markers and two chalkboards.
   But teaching materials weren't the only thing missing. The
second-graders' 15-year-old teacher, Miss Mahmoud, only in 9th grade
herself, conceded she has no teaching qualifications.
   ``What I can give them is better than nothing, but it can't
compare with what they'd be learning in school,'' she said.
   Besides teaching basic Arabic and math to her fourth-grade class,
instructor Manah Abbas, 20 teaches a new subject called ``national
education'' ordered in April by uprising leaders linked to the PLO.
   ``I teach them about the intefadeh and how not to be afraid of
the soldiers when they come to the village,'' said Miss Abbas, who
wore an enamel necklace showing all Palestine, including Israel,
painted in the colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court has overturned a ban on
Martin Scorsese's film, ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' though
the judges said the movie is likely to offend some people.
   The country's 27-member Theater and Film Censorship Board banned
the film last October. The panel cited a criminal law that forbids
practices offensive to the beliefs of any religious group.
   The movie, adapted from a 1955 novel by Nikos Kazanthakis,
touched off protests by Christian groups in the United States and
Europe. Some Christians have been offended by Scorsese's portrayal
of Jesus Christ as a human being with passions and weaknesses.
   In reversing the ban Thursday, the five-judge panel said it was
``not enough that the movie is likely to stir up opposition or even
offense against a portion of those who choose to see it.''
   Amnon Globus of Golan-Globus Cannon, the film's Israeli
distributors who appealed the case to the Supreme Court, said its
decision signaled ``the end of censorship'' in Israel.
   ``The ones who have to judge whether a movie should be shown or
not is the public,'' said Globus.
   He said the movie would be shown in Israel by next week, after
Hebrew subtitles are completed.

   Entertainer Kris Kristofferson and
his wife, honoring a promise to their slain housekeeper, have become
guardians of the woman's three daughters.
   The Malibu couple's request was granted Tuesday by Superior Court
Judge David Rothman after several days of closed hearings to decide
custody of Maria Juana Aguilar's children.
   Kristofferson and his wife, Lisa, said they wanted keep a promise
they made to her a week before her death: to see that her children
were taken care of should anything happen to her.
   Rothman granted co-guardianship to the woman's sister, Vicenta
Aguilar, with whom the children will live in Culver City. He refused
a guardianship request from the family of Ricardo Arauz, who pleaded
guilty in March to second-degree murder in the shooting death of his
common-law wife, Ms. Aguilar.
   The father's relatives had sought guardianship of the two
children fathered by Arauz: Maria, 4, and Marta, 9. The father of
their 12-year-old half-sister, Brenda, lives in El Salvador.
   The youngsters' 32-year-old mother had faithfully served the
Kristofferson family as a housekeeper for 10 years, according to
court documents.
   Shortly before she died, Ms. Aguilar confided in Mrs.
Kristofferson that she feared for her life because of her husband's
beatings. A week later, she was shot three times and killed.

   The cops may be good at nabbing criminals, but
they haven't been doing very well selling 30,000 Linda Ronstadt
concert tickets to raise money for a sports center for young people.
   But prospects for selling the $10 tickets looked better after the
police officers' plight was publicized Thursday by the Los Angeles
Times.
   ``We've been getting a lot of calls from a lot of different
people, including some publicity agents, coming on board to help
us,'' said Officer Dale Erwin of the Los Angeles Police Department's
Hollenbeck Division. ``People read the article and want to get
involved and help us out.''
   The newspaper story explained how Sgt. Alexander Gomez was
dejected because he had volunteered to sell tickets to the July 1-2
Linda Ronstadt concerts, but had sold only 3,000 of the 30,000 by
Wednesday.
   ``Where do I go from here,'' Gomez had asked rhetorically. ``It's
so much easier for me to go out on patrol and put my suspect in jail
and go home.''
   Gomez came up with the concert idea to raise money to help meet
higher operating costs of the police department's soon-to-expand
Hollenbeck Youth Center, where 10,000 youths each year participate
in boxing, karate, baseball and basketball programs.
   Ronstadt agreed to do the benefit concerts if the police promoted
them.
   A Hollywood production firm helped Gomez with public relations,
and he hoped to get by with a tiny budget for posters and public
service announcements.
   ``They don't tell you they run them at 3 in the morning when
nobody is up,'' he said with disgust.

   Actress Lisa Bonet is suing a drug store chain
over a photograph of her baby that disappeared from a set of newly
developed snapshots and turned up in a supermarket tabloid.
   Miss Bonet, star of ``The Cosby Show'' and the movie ``Angel
Heart,'' filed suit Wednesday in federal court saying that when she
picked up developed film from a neighborhood Osco Drug Store in
suburban Reseda, a negative and photograph of her then 3-week-old
daughter, Zoe, was missing.
   The National Enquirer ran the photo Jan. 10 with an article on
Miss Bonet and musician-husband Lenny Kravitz that congratulated
baby Zoe for transforming the actress ``from a high-kicking
hell-raiser'' to a ``doting mother.''
   The lawsuit asks for unspecified general damages and $5 million
in punitive damages. The complaint doesn't name the tabloid, but it
accuses Osco's parent company, Anaheim-based America Drug Stores
Inc., of ``willful, wanton, malicious and oppressive'' conduct in
its handling of Zoe's photo.
   A corporate spokeswoman said no one was available to comment, and
the Los Angeles bureau of the National Enquirer refused to comment.

   Actor David Keith, who recently
played Oliver North in a TV movie, has pleaded innocent to drunken
driving charges.
   The 33-year-old actor, who also has played in the movies ``An
Officer and a Gentleman'' and ``Lords of Discipline,'' was absent
from the Municipal Court hearing Thursday, but his attorney, Robert
Shapiro, entered his plea, and Keith was allowed to remain free on
his own recognizance.
   The charges stem from a crash about midnight May 20, when Keith's
1988 Ford Mustang collided with another car in West Hollywood. No
one was seriously injured. Keith's blood alcohol level tested at .18
percent, almost double the state standard for drunken driving.

   A union leader who claims he was
arrested by Treasury Police, accused of leftist ties and tortured
was released Thursday, a spokesman for his group said.
   The union official, Jose Tomas Mazariego, disappeared Monday
after leaving the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador. He reportedly sought
a U.S. visa because he was to leave the next day for a visit at the
invitation of U.S. labor groups.
   Witnesses said he was picked up by men in civilian clothes who
did not identify themselves.
   A spokesman for Mazariego's group, the National Unity of
Salvadoran Workers, said in a telephone interview that Mazariego was
released at 5 p.m. Thursday.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mazariego
reported that police accused him of links to leftist guerrilla
organizations and burned his body with acid.
   A spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America in
Trenton, N.J., said Mazariego had been scheduled to give a talk in
Philadelphia on Thursday and in New Jersey on June 19.
   The National Unity of Salvadoran Workers is the largest labor
union in El Salvador. Marzariego also serves as an official of the
Salvadoran Telecommunications Union.

NBC News reports.
   The network reported Thursday that the documents were seized in
October in London by British authorities after Noriega's bank, the
Bank of Credit and Commerce, was indicted in the drug money case in
Florida.
   British authorities this week gave U.S. investigators more than
1,000 documents and show that the Panamanian general controlled up
to seven secret accounts, according to NBC.
   According to the documents, Noriega deposited at least $50
million since he opened the accounts seven years ago while his Army
salary was about $50,000 a year, NBC said.
   In one transaction, $27 million of Noriega's money was
transferred out of a secret account in London to one in Luxembourg
just one day after Noriega was indicted on drug charges in the
United States, according to the report.
   Authorities whom NBC did not identify said one key document is a
letter from Noriega to his banker, Amjad Awan, instructing him that
the accounts must be kept secret and that no bank statements ever be
sent to Noriega in Panama.
   NBC said authorities believe that most of the money came from
Noriega's dealings with Colombian drug bosses, international arms
dealers and the CIA, which reportedly had Noriega on its payroll.
   The Bank of Credit and Commerce International was charged in
Tampa, Fla., in October 1988 with laundering millions of dollars in
cocaine profits collected in U.S. cities.

   A teen-ager charged in the firebombing death
of a baby has become a focus of disputes about racial justice, the
death penalty for juveniles and whether Washington is imposing its
legal standards on Alabama.
   The District of Columbia Court of Appeals is expected to decide
soon whether Alabama can extradite the black 17-year-old, known in
court documents only as O.M. because of his juvenile status.
   Prosecutors deny race has anything to do with the matter, and the
baby's relatives and an NAACP official agree.
   ``It doesn't make any difference to me what color somebody is,
black, white or polka dot,'' said District Attorney Jimmy
Hedgespeth. ``What a lot of folks are not saying is that the victim
of this crime was black. There is no place on my docket for white or
black. It doesn't matter to me.''
   O.M. was charged with murder and arson in the death of
14-month-old Tamel Jackson. The baby died in a kitchen blaze on the
night of May 12, 1988, after a plastic jug of gasoline was tossed
into his apartment at a housing project where a relative had been
involved in a fight.
   The teen-ager's grandmother testified at a court hearing in
Washington that the white authorities in Etowah County, a mostly
rural area that includes the steel city of Gadsden, have a
longstanding vendetta against her family. The youth's father and
uncle died in police custody, she said.
   Washington police captured the boy in December only after his
grandmother, Alyce Guice Thomas, was jailed for 82 days last summer
by an Etowah County judge for failing to produce the teen-ager in
court. She said he disappeared the night of the fire, after police
released him to her custody. The jailing set off small civil rights
demonstrations in Gadsden.
   The District of Columbia Council passed legislation May 30
intended to block the teen-ager's return to Gadsden for 90 days.
Council members said extradition would violate the district's ban on
the death penalty, because if O.M. is convicted in Alabama, he could
face execution in the electric chair.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has heard arguments but not yet ruled on a
challenge to the death penalty for those who were minors when they
committed crimes. The Alabama boy was 16 at the time of Tamel's
death.
   A Superior Court judge in Washington ruled March 30 that O.M.
should be returned to Alabama. But the extradition was delayed until
after his appeal, which could make the council's action moot.
   Hedgespeth would not say what he has decided about whether to
seek the death penalty.
   ``They're fanning enough flames up there in Washington,'' he
said. ``I'm just sitting here keeping my mouth shut.''
   He said county blacks who gave him 90 percent of their vote when
he was elected ``asked two things of me _ that I prosecute
black-on-black crime just like anybody else, and that I not
systematically strike blacks from juries.''
   He said that in his 2{ years in the office, he has followed both
requests.
   Sol Reynolds, Tamel's uncle, said race has nothing to do with the
charges against the 17-year-old.
   ``If they want to talk about being mistreated, the baby was the
one mistreated because he is dead and gone,'' Reynolds said.
   Tamel's grandmother, Emma Nell Rutledge, said she wants whoever
killed the baby to get what they deserve.
   Three people, all black, have been charged with arson and murder.
Yul Devoe Guice, 31, who is suspected of throwing the plastic jug of
gasoline into the project apartment, is in the county jail. The
other alleged accomplice has not been found.
   Spencer Thomas, a Gadsden physician who heads the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
said he believes O.M. would get as fair a trial at home as anywhere.
   ``It seems to me we all want to see justice dealt out,'' Thomas
said. ``I haven't gotten the opinion that we are any better or worse
off than some of the other areas in the country.''

   Sixteen people were killed and 30
injured when a local tourist bus and a truck collided in
southeastern Thailand, police said today.
   Police Lt. Rathsith Doungngung said the accident occurred
Thursday near Chanthaburi, about 130 miles southeast of the capital
Bangkok. Rathsith said both the bus and truck drivers fled the scene
of the accident.
   The crash was the second accident involving a tourist bus in
Thailand this month. On June 7, 22 people were killed when a tour
bus was struck by a truck in central Thailand.

<HEAD>Teen Tells Congress of Gun-Toting Child Drug Dealers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The teen-ager sat gingerly at the witness table
and spoke so softly that the congressmen had trouble hearing her.
But there was nothing gentle or innocent in the tale she told of
children carrying guns to carry out the drug trade.
   ``You can get guns on the street just about as easily as you can
get candy,'' Detra J. of the District of Columbia, whose last name
was not revealed, told the House Select Committee on Children, Youth
and Families on Thursday.
   ``Everyone knows how to get a gun if they want one. The guns
range from .22s to 9 millimeters to Uzis.''
   Generally, she said, the youngsters get their guns from the drug
traffickers for whom they work.
   ``If they hustle for a person _ he's a runner or a hit man _ he's
getting a gun to carry out the orders the man has given him,'' said
Detra, 18.
   The hearing on children and guns occurred one day after Florida
Gov. Bob Martinez asked state lawmakers for a law that would punish
people who leave firearms within reach of children.
   Pediatrician Katherine K. Christoffel of Chicago, representing
the American Academy of Pediatrics, painted a grim picture for the
panel:
   ``Ten American children ages 18 and under are killed every day in
handgun suicides, homicides and accidents,'' she said. ``Three or
four times as many are wounded. One of every 25 admissions to
American pediatric trauma centers is due to gunshot wounds. In 1987,
gun injuries were the fourth-leading cause of unintentional-injury
death for children ages 14 and under. For inner-city black
adolescent boys and young men, firearm injuries are the leading
cause of death.''
   But Gary Kleck, an associate professor of criminology at Florida
State University, said accidental shootings of innocent bystanders
``are extremely rare,'' that the involvement of guns in youth
suicide has fallen since 1979, and that fatal gun accidents
involving youths, as well as for all people, have been declining for
20 years.
   Nevertheless, Detra said she knows eight people who have been
shot to death, and more who have been wounded. Of those killed, she
said, ``Half had guns and were in a gunfight, and half of them were
innocent bystanders.''
   Drug-related killings have given Washington the nation's highest
per capita murder rate. So far this year, 202 murders have been
committed in the District, compared to 133 at this time last year.
Most have been drug-related, police say.
   The lure of dramatic monetary rewards in the drug trade inspires
youngsters to get involved even when they see friends killed, said
Detra, who graduated from high school last year and now works for a
local recreation program to keep young people off the streets.
   ``They get involved because they want fast money, to buy cars,
jewelry and radios. They don't get jobs because the pay is too
low,'' she said.
   Youngsters ``look at the hustlers as role models,'' in part
because they have money and in part because they ``are nice to the
young children,'' she said.
   Detra said one way to curtail youthful involvement in the drug
trade is to offer better jobs at better wages. She also said
youngsters need alternative role models, ``other adults who are
willing to talk and spend time'' with younger children.
   Meanwhile, she dismissed many ideas offered by lawmakers as ways
to deter young people from getting access to guns.
   Holding parents liable for their children's use of weapons will
fail because ``there's not too many youth today who talk to their
parents,'' she said. ``It's not a family bond anymore'' and parents
don't have control over their drug-dealing children.
   Fear of arrest and a substantial prison term for carrying a
firearm also won't deter those in the drug trade because they feel
``it's not going to happen to me,'' she said.
   The only thing that might change their minds is if authorities
``lock them up so they understand it's not so easy to carry a gun
and get away with it. ... They're not going to believe it until they
see it.''
   Passing laws making it more difficult to buy guns legally also
won't work, Detra said. The District of Columbia has one of the
toughest gun control laws in the country, yet young people have no
trouble obtaining them illegally, she said.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's four-day visit
to West Germany was enveloped by good feelings and kind words that
will be difficult to translate into personal political gain.
   Both the Soviet president and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
face an array of domestic difficulties that cannot be washed away by
several days of friendly, high-profile meetings.
   Although Gorbachev's great popularity abroad adds to his prestige
and the status of the Soviet Union, it has not touched fundamental
problems that trouble millions of Soviets _ a continued lack of food
and consumer goods, housing shortages and stifling bureaucracy.
   Kohl and his Christian Democratic party have suffered in state
elections the past two years, losing control of major West German
cities. The chancellor is accused of mishandling recent
controversies, such as the disclosure of a West German role in an
alleged Libyan chemical weapons plant and the NATO furor over
short-range nuclear weapons.
   The summit produced a historic joint declaration of goals for
easing tensions in Europe and boosted trust and confidence between
Soviets and West Germans.
   But it was devoted mostly to creating a positive atmosphere and
skirted sensitive issues like the future of divided Germany and
differing approaches to disarmament.
   After years when their tottering leaders were an embarrassment,
Soviets have become accustomed to seeing foreign crowds cheering
their leader.
   Gorbachev remains popular at home, but many Soviets are beginning
to question when and if his reform policies will improve living
standards.
   While he was away, other Soviet officials were struggling with
what has become a chronic problem _ an outbreak of violence between
ethnic groups, this time in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
   Reasons for the unrest are not clear, but some blame an economic
collapse caused by overcrowding and unemployment.
   In West Germany, Gorbachev continually stressed the theme of
cooperation. If the two countries do cooperate more closely, it
could help the Soviet Union in two ways.
   A lessening of military tension would allow Moscow to turn more
of its industrial potential to producing consumer goods. Gorbachev
has said he needs a lessening of international tension to devote
more resources to the ailing economy.
   Gorbachev invited finance and industry leaders in Cologne to help
convert Soviet defense industries. That offers another avenue to
improving the Soviet economy _ increased investment by West German
business.
   West Germany is the Soviet Union's largest Western trading
partner, and businessmen showed the Soviet leader a dazzling array
of high technology.
   But Gorbachev stressed that he did not come as a beggar. He
emphasized cooperation, proposing to merge the Soviet Union's
abilities in basic scientific research with West German technology
for the benefit of both sides.
   Kohl's problems are of an entirely different nature, but no less
threatening.
   His party currently polls less support than the leftist Social
Democrats and risks losing national elections in December 1990.
   Kohl's slide was arrested somewhat after the even higher-profile
visit two weeks ago of President Bush, with whom he was photographed
frequently during a summit that lasted less than two days.
   Bush came to West Germany immediately after the NATO summit in
Brussels on May 29-30, at which Washington and Bonn were able to
mend fences after a months-long dispute over negotiating with the
East bloc to reduce short-range rockets.
   Having salvaged a compromise from a confrontation that threatened
alliance unity, Kohl was riding high during the Bush visit. His
three sessions with Gorbachev also likely boosted his prestige.
   Ralf Fuecks, a leader of the far-left Greens Party, remarked
after the summit that ``Chancellor Kohl had tried to sun himself in
Gorbachev's glow.''
   The effects should be apparent this weekend.
   Kohl's party is running candidates for top posts in
Rhineland-Palatine and Saarland states Sunday as well as European
Parliament elections.

   A two-state coal miners' wildcat strike
escalated Thursday with roving pickets expanding their walkout to
the northern West Virginia coal field, company officials said.
   ``I think what we're seeing is it's pretty much spreading,'' said
Island Creek Coal Co. spokesman Noel Jones.
   Island Creek's southern West Virginia mines, employing about 190,
have been shut down since Monday as striking workers ignore a
federal judge's back-to-work order.
   On Thursday, the walkout spread to Island Creek's Grant County
mines, employing 625, and its Nicholas County mines, where 250
miners work, Jones said.
   All BethEnergy Mines Inc. West Virginia mines were shut down,
idling about 600 workers in Boone, Nicholas and Barbour counties,
said company president R.J. Fisher.
   Estimates of the number of miners idled by the wildcat range up
to 10,000.
   The walkout began Monday as a show of solidarity with 1,600
United Mine Workers members in West Virginia and Virginia on strike
since April against The Pittston Coal Group.
   UMW members at Pittston had been working for 14 months without a
contract. In particular, workers are angry that the company dropped
out of the union's national contract with the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association in an attempt to wring favorable work-rule
changes.
   Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but they
have said they did not authorize the walkouts, which violate a
no-strike clause in the union's 1988 national contract with the BCOA.
   BCOA Chairman Robert Quenon on Thursday called on UMW leadership
to end the walkout, saying any hopes the strike will make other
companies pressure Pittston to settle on a contract are misguided.
   ``I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their
company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to
run my company,'' said Quenon, president of Peabody Holding Co., the
nation's largest coal producer.
   In Washington, U.S. Rep. Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., called for
Pittston and New Beckley Mining Co., also the object of a UMW
contract strike, to settle with the union.
   ``These companies are doing a grave disservice to those coal
operators who negotiated in good faith and signed agreements with
the UMWA,'' Rahall said.
   ``By refusing to come to terms with their workers, these
companies are creating an atmosphere in the coal fields which is not
conducive to the type of stability and security of supply the
purchasers of our coal have come to expect.''
   Rahall also offered encouragement to three top union officials
who have been jailed without bond in Roanoke, Va., for orchestrating
picket-line civil disobedience in the Pittston strike.
   ``And to those who have been jailed for no act of violence, but
for exercising your constitutional rights, I say do not despair,''
Rahall said.
   The strike also spread Thursday to barge-loading operations along
the Kanawha River in the Charleston area. Several operators along
the river reported that pickets manned entrances to their
facilities. Some continued to move coal while others could not.
   UMW pickets appeared briefly at Amherst Industries Inc. near
Charleston, where 17 United Steelworkers members failed to report to
work, a spokesman said. About 18 pickets in front of Hatfield Dock
and Transfer Inc. in Marmet kept a half-dozen employees from going
to work, one employee said.
   Madison Coal and Supply Inc. tied up three tugboats Thursday,
idling 31 employees, said Bill Barr, manager of marine traffic. He
said he expects more layoffs if the wildcats continue.
   ``This is going to put the whole state into an economic crisis,''
Barr said.
   The walkout hasn't hurt West Virginia's economy yet, but the pain
threshhold could be near for some areas, state Energy Department
spokeswoman Twila Matheny said.
   ``When you're talking about your heavier coal producing counties,
and 90 percent of their mines closed, we could be near that now,''
she said.
   Lawyers for seven coal companies filed damage lawsuits in federal
court Wednesday naming the UMW and several locals in southern West
Virginia as defendants.
   Several companies said they are suffering daily losses of as much
as $97,000 because of the strike.
   There is ``a 100 percent chance'' of a sympathy strike in
Alabama, said United Mine Workers international executive board
member Tommy Buchanan, whose District 20 includes most of the state.
   Buchanan, however, said but UMW President Richard Trumka would
make the final decision on any walkout. There are an estimated 6,500
miners in the state, most of them union members.

<HEAD>Some Baptists Have Different View After Convention in Sin City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skeptical Southern Baptists and Las Vegans sized
each other up this week as the town some have dubbed Sin City played
unlikely host to the passionate opponents of gambling and drinking.
   Stan Pritchett, a delegate to the Southern Baptist Convention,
and cabbie Don Capaldi termed the three-day event a draw _ with eyes
opening on both sides of what has been called the meeting of the
high rollers and the Holy Rollers.
   The gathering for the nation's largest Protestant denomination
ended Thursday.
   ``They're nice, decent people; they even gave me a Bible,'' said
Capaldi as hundreds of Baptists passed out Bibles and imparted their
faith to tourists and residents. ``I don't think they can do much
about our image, or our thinking.''
   Down the neon-bathed thoroughfare known as the Strip, Pritchett
approached tourists who hurried between casinos Wednesday to beat
the 100-degree-plus heat.
   ``The people have been generally very friendly,'' said Pritchett
of Pensacola, Fla. ``We thought people would look at us like a calf
looks at a new gate. Generally the people have been very friendly.
The atmosphere here is like almost any place, except for the
gambling.''
   Ted Wakeman, pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church in
Fallon, 380 miles to the northwest, said he takes exception to the
image rap.
   ``I get a little upset with the people who came here from back
East and are bad-mouthing Nevada,'' Wakeman said.
   ``A lot of people thought they'd come here and find a lot of
people gambling and drunk,'' said Annette Edwards of Nashville,
Tenn., who tended one of the booths in the exhibit hall. ``That's
just the impression people who live outside of here have. But it
wasn't like that at all.''
   ``I would think from all I've heard that the convention would
look with favor on our returning to Las Vegas in the future,'' said
Al Shackleford, the Southern Baptist Convention's vice president for
public relations. ``I have heard nothing but good reports about the
people of Las Vegas.''
   At the Stardust Hotel and Casino, spokesman Jim Seagrave said
slot machine play for the hotel was down considerably for the week.
   Outside, on the Strip, one of the Baptists earlier this week
approached Jeri Martinez, a tourist from Escondido, Calif.
   ``Have you met Jesus?'' the man asked.
   ``You mean, in person?'' she responded, surprised by the question.
   ``No, in your heart,'' he replied.
   ``Yes, I have, in my heart,'' Ms. Martinez answered.
   He handed her a book titled ``Here's Hope _ Jesus Cares for You.''
   ``I guess it was a nice gesture,'' she said.
   The title of the book was emblazoned on billboards across Las
Vegas for weeks prior to the convention.
   Pages of the Las Vegas phone book were distributed so that the
20,423 convention delegates and others could pray for the city's
700,000 residents.
   Some 1,800 Baptists fanned out across the city last weekend,
knocking on doors in a mission to save souls. They reported polite
response.
   ``I think they're going to be surprised when they find we're just
a normal city like any other city,'' Mayor Ron Lurie had promised
before the convention.
   Some members of a Southern Baptist advance team who have been
here since January preparing for the convention said they'd found a
different city than they expected.
   ``I really have been impressed with Las Vegas,'' said Stanley
Clark, a church volunteer. ``We've been in a lot of other cities
that, to use a term, are more Sin City than Las Vegas is.''

<TEXT>
   China has always been difficult to figure out.
But as the repression in Beijing rolls on, President Bush isn't much
easier to read than the most inscrutable leaders who have guided the
world's most populous nation.
   Bush comes to his job with double training in Chinese affairs. He
headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing and is a former director
of the Central Intelligence Agency.
   His experience in these and other posts helped put him in the
White House. Figuring out what goes on behind the bamboo curtain in
Beijing is expected of the president based on his background and the
data flowing to his desk from U.S. diplomatic and intelligence
sources.
   And yet, nearly two weeks after hundreds of pro-democracy
students were gunned down in Tiananmen Square, the president and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III still seem to be waiting for
the other shoe to drop.
   There is no indication they have an overall strategy for dealing
with China or that they have come to any conclusions about what to
expect next.
   Bush, in two news conference, and Baker, sporadically through his
spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, have chided top Chinese officials
for suppressing dissent and otherwise violating international
standards of human rights.
   The criticism has been mild. Bush suspended military sales to
China and Baker, taking the advice of Ambassador James Lilley, urged
Americans to leave the country. Those, too, were minimal actions.
   Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt on Wednesday called in
Chinese Ambassador Han Xu to protest the ordered expulsion of
reporters from The Associated Press and Voice of America from
Beijing. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the
journalists' right to report the news.
   That's not a difficult or very imaginative stand to take.
   But the administration did not retaliate by ordering the
expulsion of any of the 25 Chinese journalists in Washington. There
was no U.S. tit-for-tat diplomacy, the usual response to expulsions
of American diplomats or reporters.
   Congress, meanwhile, has been relatively feisty. On Wednesday, 67
senators, including both the Republican and Democratic leadership,
signed a letter to Prime Minister Li Peng urging him to release
jailed Chinese student leaders.
   On Thursday, at a House hearing, several lawmakers criticized the
State Department for what they said was a sluggish evacuation of
Americans. Some said they helped constituents out of China while the
State Department while still contemplating the situation.
   Many Americans businesses had ordered their workers to leave
before the department made its move on Tuesday.
   Rep. Rod Chandler, R-Wash., said. ``In a crisis in which the
lives of U.S. citizens are in danger, I believe protection of
Americans must be the highest priority. Clearly this was not the
case in China this month.''
   Bush set the tone for his gentle policy toward China at a news
conference June 5, two days after the carnage in Tiananmen Square,
when he said he did not intend to respond emotionally to events in
Beijing.
   Bush said the students struggling for democracy would be hurt if
the United States went beyond cutting military ties with China.
   ``I don't want to see a total break in this relationship and I
will not encourage a total break,'' he said.
   To this day, U.S. diplomatic and economic ties to China are
intact. Ambassador Lilley has not been recalled for
``consultations,'' a traditional signal of disapproval. The staff at
the U.S. embassy in Beijing and at four consulates through the
country has not been trimmed.
   The supposition is that Bush and Baker are holding back on the
theory the situation in Beijing is stabilizing, that the Chinese
leadership will forgo further excesses.
   But on Thursday, three Chinese were sentenced to death in
connection with the burning of a train and the beating of security
officials during pro-democracy demonstrations in Shanghai. These
were the first announced death sentences since Army troops went into
action in Tiananmen Square.
   State television in Beijing, meanwhile, showed reputed protest
leaders being crowded into police vans, their heads shaven and signs
dangling from their necks describing their alleged crimes.
   In less than two weeks, the Chinese government has reported
arresting more than 1,000 people in a nationwide crackdown.
   Under Presidents Carter and Reagan, enormous pressure was exerted
on the Soviet Union. China was spared as Deng Xiaoping appeared to
be steering his country toward both political and economic reform.
   And yet, the student rebellion _ and the crackdown _ did not come
out of the blue.
   Li Peng had spoken out repeatedly against student demands for
greater democracy. ``They do not realize that capitalism is not
feasible in China,'' he said after protests in the winter of 1986-87.
   Hope, more than fact, nurtured the notion in America that Deng
Xiaoping and his heirs were secretly supporting democratic trends.

<HEAD>Southern Baptists Convention Calls for Strict Limits on Abortion</HEAD>

   Southern Baptists wrapped up their first stay in
this gambling city by urging states to enact legislation restricting
abortions except to save the mother's life.
   The nation's largest Protestant body also approved resolutions
Thursday condemning past racism within its ranks and calling for an
end to happy hours at taverns throughout the nation.
   The resolutions were approved at the end of the three-day
Southern Baptist Convention that attracted 20,423 delegates.
   Baptist officials said it was the sixth largest Baptist
convention in 132 years, despite fears that many would stay away
because of concerns over the Sin City image of Las Vegas and its
distance from traditional Baptist strongholds.
   The convention rejected arguments that abortions should be
permitted in cases of rape or incest or if the fetus is severely
deformed.
   One delegate objected that the resolution would call for abortion
laws that require ``moral heroism.''
   ``We do though want to say we do not want to victimize the child
in the womb because evil things have happened to bring that child
into the womb,'' said Mark Coppenger, chairman of the denomination's
Committee on Resolutions.
   The resolution noted that a U.S. Supreme Court decision is
pending that may reopen the possibility of broader state
restrictions on abortion.
   It also reaffirmed the support of the 14.8 million-member
denomination for a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion
except to prevent the imminent death of the mother.
   The convention, formed in 1845 in a dispute with Northern
Baptists over slavery, said in a resolution on racism that the
denomination repents of past bigotry. It called for members and
churches ``to reach across racial boundaries, establishing fraternal
rather than paternal friendships.''
   The resolution also called upon the predominantly white
denomination to bring about greater racial and ethnic representation
at every level of the church. About 300,000 Southern Baptists are
black.
   The denomination stopped short of approving an amendment
condemning apartheid in South Africa because of concerns it would
hurt evangelistic efforts there.
   The racism issue arose in the denomination last fall when a
member of the Christian Life Commission, Dr. Curtis W. Caine Sr.,
reportedly said in a commission meeting that the late Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. was a fraud. Baptist Press reported Caine also said
apartheid in South Africa ``doesn't exist anymore and was beneficial
when it did, because it meant separate development.''
   Delegates also approved a resolution on drunken driving that
seeks increased excise taxes on alcohol, no more use of celebrities
to promote drinking and the elimination of happy hours in which
drinks are discounted.

   Ambassadorial nominee Donald Gregg ended his
confirmation hearings by insisting he was unaware until December
1986 of Oliver North's secret resupply operation to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua, but a leading Democrat says he's unconvinced.
   Gregg asserted Thursday he didn't tell then-Vice President Bush
about the resupply network because Gregg didn't learn the extent of
North's involvement until two months after one of the network's
planes was shot down in October 1986.
   Gregg told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that had he
known about the resupply effort, he would have ``taken steps to stop
the operation.''
   The panel of 10 Democrats and nine Republicans will vote Tuesday
on whether to recommend to the full Senate that the CIA's former
station chief in Seoul be confirmed as ambassador to South Korea.
Gregg had been Bush's national security adviser when he was vice
president.
   Committee members said the vote is likely to be close, although
there were indications at least one Democrat on the panel might vote
for Gregg. Democrats repeatedly challenged Gregg's credibility and
said his alleged lack of judgment disqualifies him for confirmation
as an ambassador.
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., said through a spokeswoman that
``barring evidence of lying or perjury'' he is leaning toward
confirmation.
   ``He wants to review all of the evidence and he plans to make a
conscientious decision,'' said spokeswoman Julia Sutherland.
   At the hearing, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., referred to a
two-page January 1985 memo to North which, according to Cranston,
showed that Felix Rodriguez, a longtime friend with whom Gregg was
in frequent contact, was involved with the Contras.
   The memo was dated several days after Rodriguez met with Bush and
Gregg in the vice president's office. Gregg said he couldn't
remember whether North also attended what turned out to be the first
of three meetings between Rodriguez and Bush.
   Gregg testified that Contra resupply was ``absolutely not''
discussed at the January meeting.
   Gregg, who said he sent Rodriguez to El Salvador to assist that
country's military, insisted he first learned Rodriguez had
something to do with the Contras in August 1986. That's when
Rodriguez complained that crooked arms merchants were gouging the
Contras in a scandal he said could become another Watergate.
   Gregg says he didn't tell Bush, but rather convened a meeting
four days later with representatives of various agencies, including
the CIA and National Security Council. North didn't attend, even
though Gregg asked that he do so.
   But Gregg asserted he didn't learn of the extent of North's
involvement in the operation until December 1986 when he said
Rodriguez detailed it for him.
   North had contacted Gregg to complain about Rodriguez' not using
secure communications equipment and about allegedly stealing a plane
belonging to the Contras. But Gregg said he failed to conclude from
those incidents or the August 1986 meeting that North was running a
resupply operation or that Rodriguez was part of it.
   In December 1986, Rodriguez telephoned Gregg and told him he and
North had agreed to keep Gregg in the dark.
   Gregg said he was ``furious'' with North and ``felt very let
down'' by Rodriguez. ``I faulted myself for not putting the pieces
together,'' Gregg said.
   ``You are trying to convince us of an elaborate conspiracy'' to
keep Gregg from knowing about Contra assistance run by North, said
Cranston.
   North and courier Robert Owen knew about Rodriguez' role, as did
U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Col. James Steele in El
Salvador, so ``why didn't you know?'' asked Cranston.
   ``That's a pretty sweeping assertion,'' responded Gregg, who said
at least two U.S. military officials who dealt with Rodriguez in
Central America testified they didn't know he was involved in the
resupply network.
   Cranston said he regards Gregg's performance Thursday as no more
complete or satisfactory than his testimony at the first round of
his confirmation hearing in May.
   In May, Cranston accused Gregg of sponsoring ``a free-lance
covert operation out of the vice president's office'' to help
resupply the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to
the rebel force.

<HEAD>Researchers Find That Light Can Reset Biological Clock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists in Boston are learning to treat jet
lag, insomnia and other symptoms of a jangled body clock with
carefully controlled doses of ordinary light.
   Dr. Charles Czeisler and colleagues at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston reported today that they succeeded in
consistently resetting the body clocks of test subjects using timed
exposures to a light about as bright as the rising sun. Their
account of the experiments was published in Science magazine.
   Czeisler said the wake-rest cycles of the subjects could be moved
forward or back with ease, but the changes lack the precision needed
for a useful therapy for jet setters or for those with troubled
sleep.
   But, eventually, he said, the study will develop the techniques
needed to use light to change the body clock and relieve the wilting
weariness many feel when their life style is out of phase with the
sun.
   Czeisler said the research proved conclusively that light can
send a signal to the brain to reset the biological clock.
   When such light shows up at the wrong time, it jumbles the body's
wake-sleep cycle _ called the circadian rhythm. Airline travelers
know this disorder as jet lag, but it's also a problem for night
shift workers and for thousands of people with sleep disorders, said
Czeisler.
   Many airline schedules aggravate jet lag, he said, because
travelers are forced to cross many time zones in darkness and arrive
at their destination just as the sun comes up.
   ``When you leave here to fly overnight to London, the flight
arrives over there at 6 or 7 in the morning,'' he said. ``When you
go outside, you are getting an exposure to light that is resetting
you in exactly the opposite direction than what you wish to be set.
It is resetting you for Hawaii, instead of Europe.''
   Czeisler said a flight that arrives in Europe later in the day
would be easier on the body clock, but not enough is known yet about
the effects of light on human circadian rhythm to adjust travel
times precisely.
   ``The system is much more complicated than we previously
thought,'' he said.
   To better understand the body clock, Czeisler and other
investigators put 14 young men into a darkened laboratory free of
any external time cues, and then exposed them to light from
fluorescent lamps that mimicked the intensity of the dawning sun.
   Czeisler said the researchers found they could reset the body
clock of the test subjects in any direction, depending on when the
light was applied.
   He said exposure at one part of the cycle would move the body
clock backward, an eastward time shift, while exposure at another
time would have the opposite effect. Exposure at some points in the
biological day, said Czeisler, would cause no change.
   Circadian cycles of the test subjects were determined by
measurements of body temperature, hormone levels, kidney function
and alertness, all of which are affected by the body clock.
   Unlike travelers, they were exposed only to the light called for
in the experiment. Czeisler said all light exposure durations,
intensities and frequencies influence the body clock.
   Czeisler said it's now believed that light striking the retina of
the eye sends a signal down a nerve pathway to the hypothalamus in
the brain. This organ, which can control sleep, alertness and other
body functions, seems to be reset daily by light.
   This is the reason, Czeisler said, that night shift workers who
commute home at dawn may spend years trying to adjust to their work
schedule.
   ``The morning light resets their internal clock in a way that
keeps their body scheduled to be day-active and asleep at night,
even if they are trying to do the opposite. They may spend their
careers fighting their internal biological clock,'' he said.
   Science, which published a report of the study, is the journal of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Co-investigators in the study were Richard E. Kronauer, James S.
Allan, Jeanne F. Duffy, Megan E. Jewett, Emery N. Brown and Joseph
M. Ronda, all associated with Harvard University.

<TEXT>
   Three recovering Soviet alcoholics are
returning home from a two-month tour of the United States with best
wishes from President Bush's physician and cheers from thousands of
American comrades in Alcoholics Anonymous.
   About 20,000 AA members they met during their cross-country
travels autographed a copy of ``Alcoholics Anonymous,'' the
50-year-old bible of the self-help organization, and they plan to
present the book to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Victor, 42, Sasha, 43, and Volodya, 37, who follow the AA
tradition in refusing to use their last names, belong to a fledgling
AA group called ``Moscow Beginners,'' which held its first meeting
in August 1987.
   The 40 members of the group meet every night of the week in the
Soviet capital to help each other maintain their newfound sobriety.
The three members who have toured the United States since April 10
were astonished to find so many AA members _ an estimated 835,500
last year.
   But the 12-step AA program of recovery from alcoholism is the
same in both countries, they discovered.
   ``This program treats the spiritual soul of man,'' Victor, a
Moscow cinematographer, told a news conference Thursday at the
National Press Club.
   ``It is a paradox,'' he said, ``but with the recovery of the
spirit a person can be healed of the disease.''
   The Rev. J.W. Canty, an Episcopal priest from New York who helped
start the Moscow group, credited Gorbachev's liberal reform policies
for allowing AA to flourish in the Soviet Union.
   Without Gorbachev, ``AA would have to function underground,''
said Canty, chairman of the non-profit Soviet-U.S. Joint Conference
on Alcoholism, Drug Addiction and Peace in Moscow and organizer of
the tour.
   Altogether, there are fewer than 100 Soviet AA members. ``It's
very small, but it's a beginning,'' Canty said. ``It's working,
slowly but well. If you can save even one life, that's an enormous
contribution.''
   Since they arrived in New York, the three Soviets have attended
scores of AA meetings _ including one in California that drew 1,100
people _ and visited alcoholism treatment centers across the
country, from Massachusetts to Texas.
   They also met with such celebrities as Betty Ford and Kitty
Dukakis, both recovering alcoholics, Nancy Reagan, Lady Bird Johnson
and Dr. Burton Lee, the White House physician, who applauded their
AA membership.
   At their meeting at the White House on Monday, the Soviet
visitors gave Lee a ``Moscow Beginners'' lapel button, which he
promised to pin on the president's jacket even though Bush is only a
moderate social drinker.
   They will end their U.S. tour this weekend in Atlanta, with a
side trip to Plains, Ga., where they will attend a Sunday school
class led by former President Carter.
   ``Perestroika is a very popular word now in my country,'' Victor
told reporters, referring to Gorbachev's policy of restructuring the
Soviet economy.
   ``We alcoholics can restructure ourselves and become better,
happier persons,'' he said. ``I am rebuilding my life.''

   Israeli warplanes bombed Palestinian
guerrilla bases on the outskirts of this southern port in two dawn
runs Friday, police said.
   They said the planes blasted bases of the Marxist Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine both in and around the Rashidiyeh
refugee camp on Tyre's southern border 10 miles north Israel.
   The planes destroyed all targets and returned safely, the Israeli
army said.
   The area has been used to launch guerrilla attacks against Israel
and its self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon, the army
said. It did not say which guerrilla faction it was attacking.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said there was no immediate word of damage or
casualties.
   There was no comment from the Popular Front's offices in Beirut
or Damascus. The radical group, led by George Habash, is the
second-largest faction in Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation
Organization after the mainstream Fatah.
   It was Israel's second air strike into Lebanon in three days and
the eighth this year. By police count, nine people were killed and
58 wounded in the seven previous air attacks beginning Jan. 11.
   On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes bombed a hideout used by the
Popular Front and three other radical Palestinian factions in the
Chouf Mountains southeast of Beirut. Three guerrillas were killed
and nine wounded in that raid.

<HEAD>Activists Say Civil Rights Reversals Show Reagan Agenda at Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Civil rights activists are accusing the Supreme
Court of ``redneck justice'' and urging Congress to stem what they
say is a reactionary tide threatening 35 years of progress for
minorities and women.
   The court's ruling Thursday on a racial harassment case is one of
several new decisions showing that a newly solidified conservative
majority on the court is intent on carrying out former President
Ronald Reagan's agenda, civil and women's rights groups say.
   The court, by a 5-4 vote, barred the use of a key 1866 civil
rights law to fight racial harassment. But the justices voted
unanimously to uphold use of the law, originally intended to help
freed slaves, to sue private individuals for other forms of
discrimination.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said conservatives on the court ``again revealed themselves to be
hostile and insensitive to the progress of the last 20 years.
Redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less
painful than the real thing.''
   John Buchanan of the liberal People for the American Way said,
``It's a sad commentary on the state of the court's general outlook
on civil rights that today's decision must be greeted with a measure
of relief.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., urged President Bush to join
Congress in proposing bills to reverse the high court rulings.
   ``Taken separately, each of these retreats would be a source of
genuine concern,'' he said. ``Together they are a serious threat to
the 35 years of progress we have achieved toward a better and fairer
society.''
   Thursday's ruling follows three other significant high court
setbacks for those urging more aggressive steps to combat bias.
   Last January, the court banned racial quotas in the awarding of
public works projects by state and local governments.
   On June 5, the justices restricted the use of statistical
evidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities or
women to lower-paying jobs.
   And just last Monday, the court significantly expanded the power
of white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans,
even years after those plans took effect.
   Addressing the latest ruling, Julius Chambers of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund said it means ``employers who do not
want blacks on their work force can simply hire blacks and harass
them on the job until they quit.''
   Bruce Fein, a conservative who keeps a close watch on high court
rulings, said civil rights groups were exaggerating the significance
of the decision.
   But he agreed that ``there is a conservative five-member majority
now changing the evaluation and approach to the civil rights law.''
   The court acted in the case of Brenda Patterson, a black teller
for a credit union in North Carolina. She said her boss harassed her
by ordering her to do menial tasks, such as sweeping floors.
   The court's ruling bars her from suing her employer for big-money
punitive damages for alleged harassment. It does not prohibit her or
others with similar complaints from suing under a 1964 federal civil
rights law that has less sweeping financial remedies.
   Also, the 1964 law applies only to businesses with at least 15
employees, excluding some 15 percent of the American work force. The
1866 law covers all employers.
   Writing for the court Thursday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the
court's newest member, denied the court was turning its back on
minorities.
   ``Neither our words nor our decisions should be interpreted as
signaling one inch of retreat from Congress' policy to forbid
discrimination,'' he said. But he said the court's job is to
interpret the law _ not rewrite it to the liking of civil rights
advocates.
   Kennedy said the 1866 law governs contractual rights _ such as
hiring and promotion decisions _ and not other forms of conduct by
an employer, including an order to sweep floors.
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said, the
court is engaging in a ``hypertechnical'' reading of the law that
ignores its larger purpose.
   Joining Kennedy were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Byron R. White.
   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are Reagan appointees; Rehnquist was
promoted to chief justice by the former president. White had been
appointed by former President John F. Kennedy.
   In a separate decision Thursday, the court said states and state
officials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protects
civil liberties. The 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan said states
and their officials are not ``persons'' as envisioned by the 1871
law.

<HEAD>US Officials Wonder Whether Arrested General Was Corrupt or Subversive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The arrest of a decorated Cuban Army general on
corruption charges has left U.S. officials wondering about the
possibility of unrest within that country's upper military ranks.
   The officials acknowledged Thursday they have no hard evidence to
dispute official assertions in Cuba that Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa was
taken into custody because he had engaged in ``grave acts of
corruption and dishonest use of economic resources.''
   But the officials, all insisting on anonymity, also said they
could not rule out the possibility that there was more to the arrest
than meets the eye. A number of Ochoa's subordinates were reported
to have been arrested as well.
   Cuba has thus far been generally immune to the kind of upheavals
that have afflicted other communist states and has refused to
undertake the reforms being practiced in the Soviet Union and
elsewhere.
   One reason for the official caution here in assessing the
situation is that rumors of high-level discontent have circulated in
Cuba for 30 years but outright acts of rebellion have been
exceedingly rare.
   Under the rule of President Fidel Castro, Cuba has been one of
the most stable countries in the communist world or in Latin America.
   Ochoa is a veteran of fighting in Angola and Ethiopia and also
served as commander of Cuban forces in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s.
According to Rafael Fermoselle, a Cuban exile and an expert on the
Cuban military, Ochoa was awarded the title ``Hero of the
Revolution'' in 1984.
   A Council of State resolution, approved on Jan. 1, 1984, said
that Ochoa ``carried out several internationalist missions with a
particular spirit of sacrifice'' and he was cited for a ``brilliant
performance as commander of Cuban troops in Ethiopia,'' Fermoselle
has written. Ochoa also was praised for ``his honesty,
unselfishness, spirit of sacrifice, purity, desire to excel and
heroism.''
   Ochoa joined Castro's rebel army in 1958. Among the important
positions he has held was Commander of the Army in Havana. In
Nicaragua, Ochoa commanded Cuban forces believed to number about 500.
   Gen. Rafael Del Pino, the highest ranking military officer ever
to defect from Cuba, disclosed Thursday that Defense Minister Raul
Castro, brother of the president, had said in a speech Wednesday
that many of Ochoa's subordinates were arrested as well.
   Del Pino, who defected two years ago, said he believes that the
arrests were based on a high-level of discontent within Ochoa's
command which ``could have led to an uprising'' against Castro.
   Del Pino said he believes there was a relationship between the
arrest of Ochoa on Wednesday and the sacking of Transportation
Minister Diocles Torralba the day before.
   He said Torralba, during his military career, was one of the
``most beloved and intelligent'' officers and had become ``the best
prepared and most intelligent personality in the Cuban government.''

   In the visual world of computers, a young blind
woman envisions a new life.
   Vera Saliba moved to the United States 5{ years ago from her
violent homeland in Lebanon only to find a future in a field mostly
for those who can see.
   On Sunday, Ms. Saliba graduates from the Computer Science and
Engineering School at the University of California, San Diego. She
overcame her disability to become one of the college's top computer
science students.
   ``It always amazed me how much you could do with them,'' said the
22-year-old honors student. She uses a Braille keyboard and printer.
   She hopes to soon put her knowledge to work developing software
programs to give disabled people greater access to computers.
   ``There is a lot I can do now,'' Ms. Saliba said. ``If I write
one program that will improve things for disabled individuals in
general, that would be a great reward for me.''
   She said she worries daily about her parents and four siblings
who remain in East Beirut. But she wants to stay in the United
States.
   IBM wants to hire her, but she needs a work permit. The company
is working with her in preparing her case before immigration
officials. Ms. Saliba has stayed in the country on a student visa.
   Ms. Saliba maintained a 3.7 grade point average at the university.
   Few of her textbooks were available in Braille. She learned by
listening to people reading the texts aloud and reviewing class
notes they helped her take.
   A black Labrador retriever named Amaris guided her to classes.
She took all of her exams verbally.
   She applied the lessons learned in research projects on her
specially equipped computer.
   She said her blindness ``doesn't bug me, really,'' but she
admitted to feeling frustrated at times.
   ``There were times I just wanted to give up,'' she said. ``The
thing is I don't believe in giving up because ... what's left in
life if you give up?''
   Much of her frustration is rooted in not being able to
communicate often with her family. She has not been able to get
through by telephone or mail recently.
   ``I'm just hoping they're still alive and they're still OK,'' she
said.
   Her vision began to deteriorate at age 4, when the nerve relaying
visual signals to the brain was cut off for unknown reasons. At 7,
she could no longer read and she was blind by 13.
   On a two-week tourist visa to visit a brother studying in Rhode
Island, she decided to stay and enrolled at a high school.
   She was encouraged in her studies by Narragansett High's guidance

Allaire is flying to San Diego to attend her graduation.
   Scholarships and grants allowed her to go to college.
   ``She's a real top student and she has changed a lot of attitudes

UCSD's director of disabled students services. ``She just seems to
have a natural ability for computer programming.''

<HEAD>Retiring Surgeon General to Continue Public Health Efforts</HEAD>

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says he wants
to maintain his high public profile after he leaves office next
month by using every outlet to deliver his health teachings ``as
long as people will listen.''
   As he prepares to close out a seven-year stint as the nation's
top health adviser during which he made America aware of AIDS and
encouraged millions to quit smoking, ``the achievements are way
ahead of the failures,'' he said.
   ``I leave with a very good feeling,'' Koop told reporters at a
breakfast session on Thursday.
   He plans to leave this job in the Public Health Service on July
13 and begin to write his memoirs.
   After that, he said, ``I will use the written word, the spoken
word and whatever I can in the electronic media to deliver health
messages to this country as long as people will listen,'' he said.
   The imposing, silver-bearded pediatrician with a reputation for
straight talk about sensitive issues and the popularity of a
national folk hero wants to continue to be America's ``health
conscience.''
   Koop said his most successful achievement as surgeon general was
his relentless drive against smoking.
   He noted that during his tenure, the proportion of the nation
that uses tobacco has dropped from 34 percent to 26 percent and the
number of anti-smoking laws has burgeoned from 54 to more than 400
now.
   Asked what was his biggest ``turkey,'' he responded
self-assuredly: ``I didn't know there were any.''
   Koop, 72, said he enjoys a special satisfaction that he has
turned around most of the liberal critics who put up a firestorm of
opposition to his nomination by President Reagan in 1981.
   In the process, though, Koop alienated many conservatives with
his no-nonsense report on the AIDS crisis, which advocated use of
condoms and sex education beginning at young ages. And, though he
remains an adamant abortion foe, he again drew their ire when he
refused to issue a report requested by Reagan on whether women
suffer psychological harm from abortion.
   ``I never made any promises to espouse any causes, and all that I
have done in this job is to face the issues that were there and to
deal with them with as much integrity and honesty as I could,'' Koop
said.
   He says this is what directed him earlier this year when he told
Reagan there was insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that
abortions harm women psychologically.
   ``The people who asked me to do it, especially the president, had
been misled into believing that what I would find would be so
devastating that you could reverse Roe vs. Wade,'' the 1973 Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion during the first three months
of pregnancy.
   The surgeon general has no real authority to set government
policy. ``My only in influence was through moral suasion,'' he said.
   But he attained a popularity among the public that is unknown to
most government officials, and to a large extent, he said, this
protected him from attacks by the White House, where conservatives
sometimes disagreed with him.
   ``I think there were many times when certain very conservative
people in the White House would have done anything they could to
shut me up,'' he said.
   Within a week after he issued his report on the deadly acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, he said, Reagan White House staffers
asked him ``to do an update ... to take out the word condom.''
   He said no, and ``they left my office in a huff.''
   Koop acknowledged that he had let the Bush administration know he
wanted to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human
Services, which includes the Public Health Service, whose
Commissioned Corps the surgeon general oversees.
   But he denied being bitter about not getting the job.
   ``I would have liked to be secretary,'' Koop said. ``I think I
could have done a very credible job.'' But before he was passed
over, he said he was asked repeatedly what his reaction would be if
he did not get the job. His response, which he said he feels is even
more true now, was: ``I will be disappointed for a few days but
probably very happy for the rest of my life.''

<HEAD>Actress Says She'll File Complaint over Traffic Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for Zsa Zsa Gabor said he will
file a complaint accusing Beverly Hills police of roughing up the
actress during her arrest for alleged traffic law violations.
   ``Right now, we are going to prepare a formal complaint to the
police chief,'' Miss Gabor's lawyer, Dale Gribow, said Thursday.
``She's standing up for the rights of the average person.''
   Miss Gabor claims a ``gorgeous officer'' mistreated her,
impounded her $215,000 car and misplaced a diamond brooch during her
arrest Wednesday.
   At one point, she said, the officer stood ``looking like Tom
Selleck-plus. I said, `Darling, you are so handsome, why are you
doing that to me?' He must've had a bad night with his girlfriend.''
   Miss Gabor held a news conference Thursday dressed in a sweater
monogrammed with ``Rodeo Drive Beverly Hills.'' She showed bruises
on her wrists and arms.
   ``I look as if I was in a war. I'm cut where they put those cuffs
on and I'm black and blue all over,'' Miss Gabor said by telephone
earlier.
   She was handcuffed and taken to police headquarters after
allegedly slapping a policeman who pulled over her Rolls-Royce
Corniche for expired license tags.
   She was booked for investigation of evading a policeman, battery
on a policeman, driving without a valid license, driving an
unregistered car and driving with an open flask of whiskey.
   Department of Motor Vehicles records show Miss Gabor's driver's
license expired on June 6, 1988, her birthday. According to DMV
records, she was born in 1923, but the reference book ``Filmgoer's
Companion'' said she was born in 1919, making her 70 last week.
   She was released Wednesday afternoon on her own recognizance and
ordered to appear in court July 12.
   After the officer, whose name wasn't disclosed, stopped her, he
discovered her driver's license had also expired, police Lt. James
Smith said.
   ``He proceeded to run a check on the license plate and license
and she told him she was in a hurry and she left,'' Smith said.
   The officer chased her for about two blocks until she pulled
over. As she stepped out of the vehicle she slapped him, Smith said.
   But Miss Gabor said she was dragged out of her car by the
officer, who was screaming obscenities at her throughout the
incident.
   ``I'm afraid now of a policeman,'' she said. ``Darling, my nails
are all broken.''

<HEAD>Study Says Hispanics Hurt Sharply By Minimum Wage Veto</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Recasts grafs 1-2 to show study, not officials say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorities and the working poor will be
especially hurt by President Bush's veto of legislation that would
have raised their hourly wages to $4.55 by 1992, a study says.
   The veto would particularly hit hard black and Hispanic workers,
who have seen their earnings erode over the decade, said a study
released Thursday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
   The minimum wage, $3.35 an hour, hasn't been lifted since 1981.
   According to the center, an independent organization that
specializes in issues affecting low and moderate-income Americans,
Hispanics and blacks are 40 percent more likely to be paid at or
near the minimum wage than white workers.
   Yet a full-time, year-round worker earning the minimum wage and
supporting a family of three falls $2,900 below the poverty line,
the study said. In 1979, the minimum wage put a family of three at
104 percent of the poverty level.
   Today, one in every four black and Hispanic workers paid by the
hour now receives a wage too low to lift a family of three out of
poverty, even if the worker is employed full-time, the study said.
   ``The dramatic drop in the value of the minimum wage has
compounded the earnings problems of poor and minority workers and
increased their poverty rates,'' said study author Isaac Shapiro.
``To these workers, the president's veto of legislation boosting the
minimum wage is ominous news.''
   Last year, 21 percent of Hispanic workers and 21 percent of black
workers made less than $4.50 an hour, compared with 15 percent of
all white workers, Shapiro said.
   Earlier this week, Bush vetoed legislation that would raise the
minimum wage to $4.55 an hour by 1992, insisting that the new
minimum wage not exceed $4.25 an hour. The House on Wednesday was
not able to muster the votes required to override the veto.

<TEXT>
   Former national security adviser John
Poindexter today faces the judge who will handle his criminal trial
in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene, given the Poindexter
case two weeks ago, must deal with the same problem of classified
information that plagued the government's prosecution earlier this
year against Oliver North.
   Greene's decisions will determine whether prosecutors are able to
bring far-reaching conspiracy and theft charges against Poindexter.
   Rulings by U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell in the
North case led to the government's abandoning such charges. They
focus on the diversion of proceeds from the Iran arms sales to the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   North's attorneys fought, largely successfully, to convince
Gesell that substantial amounts of highly classified material were
relevant to North's defense and had to be admitted as evidence.
   U.S. intelligence agencies refused to declassify much of the
material, due to national security concerns, and the conspiracy and
theft charges were dismissed.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is trying to
avoid the problem in the Poindexter case.
   The prosecution is opposing Poindexter's request to file a motion
with the judge seeking a wide range of documents for use by the
defense.
   Greene, who won a reputation in presiding over the break-up of
AT&amp;T of moving complex cases along expeditiously, has indicated he
wants to resolve the question of the conspiracy and theft counts
soon.
   At today's court session, Greene said in a two-page order earlier
this week, he wants to address `the question whether, as in the case
against Oliver North, the government will move to dismiss the counts
charging conspiracy and theft of government property and when a
decision ... is expected.''
   Walsh said several months ago he hopes to be able to try
Poindexter on those counts.
   If the prosecution is unable to keep those charges, the
indictment against Poindexter will be reduced substantially.
   He is charged with a series of obstruction and false statement
charges involving Congress. Those accusations focus on Poindexter's
alleged involvement in producing a phony chronology in connection
with a 1985 arms shipment to Iran.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting in that false
chronology, and two other crimes.
   The false chronology said that no one in the U.S. government knew
until January 1986 that a November 1985 shipment to Iran contained
Hawk missiles.
   The shipment, assisted by the CIA, was retroactively legalized by
President Reagan with a written finding signed by the president the
month after the shipment was made.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Figure Again Charged With Drunken Driving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran-Contra figure Richard Secord faces a new
charge of drunken driving, authorities in this Washington, D.C.,
suburb said.
   Secord is appealing a conviction last month for the same offense.
   The 56-year-old retired Air Force major general was arrested in
the town of Vienna early Wednesday morning, according to Marie
Kisner, public information officer for the town.
   She said the arrest occurred after a police officer spotted a
suspicious looking vehicle that was moving very slowly and came to
almost a complete stop at a green light.
   Secord, cited for drunken driving and refusing to give a breath
or blood sample, was released on $750 cash bond after spending
several hours in the Fairfax County jail, Kisner said.
   He was convicted May 11 in Fairfax County of driving with an
alcohol level of 0.20, twice the legal limit in Virginia.
   District Judge Barbara Kimble sentenced him to 30 days in jail,
suspended his driver's license for six months, fined $500 and
ordered to enroll in an Alcohol Safety Awareness program. Kimble
then suspended the jail time and $200 of the fine and allowed Secord
to drive his car to work and to the alcohol program.
   Secord filed an appeal and a new trial is scheduled for Aug. 24.
   Secord was a key figure who worked with former White House aide
Oliver L. North in the Iran-Contra affair. He is charged with paying
illegal gratuities to North during the period when the Reagan
administration was covertly selling arms to Iran and with perjuring
himself in testimony to Congress.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Bennett Approves Idea of Capital Punishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug czar William Bennett says that beheading
some kinds of drug dealers would be a ``morally'' fitting punishment
although difficult to implement under the American system of justice.
   Bennett, interviewed Thursday on the ``Larry King Live''
television program on Cable News Network, said, ``We are not doing
enough that is morally proportionate to the nature of the offense.''
   His remarks were prompted by a caller's question, ``why not
behead the ... dealers?'' as the law calls for in some Middle
Eastern countries.
   ``What the caller suggests is morally plausible,'' Bennett said.
``It's legally difficult.''
   Bennett, who is director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, said, ``Morally, I don't have any problem with that at all.''
   ``Ask most Americans if they saw someone on the streets selling
drugs to their kids, what they would feel morally justified in doing
_ tear them (the sellers) limb from limb,'' Bennett said.
   Asked by interviewer King, ``What should we do?'' Bennett did not
answer directly but said, ``It's not a moral problem. I used to
teach ethics.''
   Bennett's spokesman, Don Hamilton, said later Bennett did not
mean to approve beheading, just capital punishment for some forms of
drug dealing.

<HEAD>With PM-S&amp;Ls Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the major provisions of
S&amp;L bailout legislation adopted by the House, and the differences
from the version passed by the Senate in April.
   The House approved the bill by a 320-97 vote late Thursday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAPITAL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The House would require S&amp;L owners to risk at least $1.50 in
tangible capital for every $100 in lending starting June 1, 1990.
The standard would be raised in steps until it reaches $3 on Jan. 1,
1995.
   The Senate requires S&amp;Ls to meet a $1.50 standard by June 1,
1991. Both versions impose growth restrictions on solvent S&amp;Ls that
fall below the standard.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FINANCING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Both chambers provide for borrowing $50 billion over three years
to close or merge failed S&amp;Ls and both provide ways to get around
the automatic spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law.
   The Senate adopted President Bush's proposal to keep the
borrowing off the budget. The House would add the borrowing to the
budget deficit, but keep the addition from triggering spending cuts.
   Both versions require a contribution of $6 billion from the
industry-owned Federal Home Loan Banks to offset repayment of the
borrowing. They also require the industry to contribute at least
$300 million a year to help pay the interest.
   House and Senate bills increase the insurance assessment on S&amp;L
deposits from 21 cents per $100 to 23 cents and bank premiums from 8
cents to 15 cents.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ANTI-FRAUD</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The House provides the Justice Department with $75 million a year
from 1989 to 1991 to detect and prosecute fraud at financial
institutions, while the Senate voted for $50 million a year.
   Both chambers raise the maximum civil penalties for reckless
disregard for safety to $1 million a day. Criminal penalties would
be $1 million per day or imprisonment for up to five years, or both.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>REGULATORY REORGANIZATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Both bills expand the authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which currently insures commercial bank deposits, to savings
and loan deposits as well.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, currently the regulator of
S&amp;Ls, would be split up. The examination and supervision wing of the
agency would become part of the Treasury Department. A separate
independent board would oversee the money-borrowing functions of the
regional home loan banks, previously overseen by the bank board.
   A new agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., would be created to
close or sell off failed S&amp;Ls. It would dispose of the more than
$300 billion in repossessed real estate owned by the institutions.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MISCELLANEOUS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The House will require S&amp;Ls to hold 80 percent of their assets
mostly in residential mortgages and consumer loans. The Senate
requires only 60 percent but says consumer loans can't be used to
meet the requirement.
   The Senate bans troubled institutions from accepting
high-interest rate deposits placed by money brokers. The House
version is similar but allows S&amp;Ls to apply for an exemption.
   The House version allows bank holding companies to buy both
healthy and ailing thrifts immediately. The Senate provides a
two-year delay before bank holding companies can buy healthy S&amp;Ls.
   The House, but not the Senate, requires the industry-owned
regional banks to provide $75 million a year for four years to
subsidize housing for poor people, increasing to $150 million a year
by 1995.
   The House also requires banks and S&amp;Ls to disclose their record
of serving the poor, minorities and women.
   The Senate allows S&amp;Ls to invest in junk bonds up to 11 percent
of assets, more for state-chartered S&amp;Ls with extra capital. The
House forbids thrifts from owning junk bonds but gives institutions
two years to sell the high-risk, high-yield bonds they already own.

   Here are major civil rights rulings by the
Supreme Court this term:
   _Richmond vs. Croson: The court, by a 6-3 vote on Jan. 23, struck
down a Richmond, Va., program requiring contractors on city building
projects to set aside at least 30 percent of the value of the
project for firms at least one-half minority owned. The court said
the quota is an unlawful form of reverse discrimination.
   _Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins: The court, by a 6-3 vote on May 1,
reinforced women's rights by ruling that employers have the burden
of disproving bias when there is evidence it played a part in
personnel decisions. The court ruled for a woman who said she was
denied promotion to partnership in an accounting firm because she
acted too much like a man.
   _Wards Cove Packing vs. Atonio: The court, by a 5-4 vote on June
5, erected significant new barriers for workers who try to prove
with statistical evidence they are victims of racial bias. The court
ruled against minority groups who said they were placed in
low-paying, less-desirable jobs at Alaska salmon canneries.
   _Martin vs. Wilks: The court, by a 5-4 vote last Monday, allowed
white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action programs
even years after they take effect. The ruling revives a challenge to
a program to promote more blacks in the Birmingham, Ala., fire
department.
   _Patterson vs. McClean Credit Union. The court, by a 5-4 vote
Thursday, barred the use of a key 1866 civil rights law to fight
racial harassment. But the justices voted unanimously to uphold use
of the law to sue private individuals for other forms of
discrimination.

   Celebrants drank champagne and sang at an
85th birthday party for Arnold Batliner, a ``money-launderer'' who
makes money the old-fashioned way _ he washes it.
   The octogenarian washes all the coins used at the St. Francis
Hotel, where the venerable if outmoded tradition once spared ladies
the mortification of white gloves begrimed by silver dollars.
   The hotel's coin-washing tradition began in 1936, when silver
dollars were in circulation, and was expanded to include all silver
change.
   Batliner estimated he has washed $15.5 million in coins at the
hotel over 27 years _ more than a million pounds of change since
1962.
   His workplace is a security-tight room deep in the bowels of the
famous Union Square hotel, which like Batliner is 85 years old this
year.
   When the coins come out of the ancient burnishing machine, they
are as bright as the day they were minted. Batliner said he enjoys
his work, adding with pride that he never encountered a coin he
couldn't clean.
   Some are tough, though. ``Sometimes there's chewing gum in
them,'' he muttered.

   Jimmy Jardin learned again a
fisherman's lesson: dash is more important than flash in scallop
shucking.
   Sporting Day-Glo sunglasses, a florescent windbreaker and plenty
of gold jewelry, all eyes were on Jardin at the International
Scallop Shucking Contest preliminaries Thursday.
   The 25-year-old fisherman entered as champion, but left knowing
how fleeting fame can be.
   In just over nine minutes, Jardin pryed 182 scallops from their
shells.
   Fast, but Mark Picanso and others were faster. Picanso took first
place by shucking 196 scallops in about the same time. He has been
shucking for a dozen years.
   Picanso will be one of four scallop shuckers representing the
United States in their annual face-off against Canada this year.
   There's one important tool of the trade: a point-sharpened butter
knife with its handle wrapped in friction tape to ensure a steady
grip.
   Picanso's secret? No flash.
   ``Concentration and rhythm, that's what you need. If you can keep
yourself from being distracted then you've got it all.''

   Nevada Bell tried to save some paper in last year's telephone

   The savings and loan bailout bill approved by
the House gives new weapons to battle ``redlining,'' the
discrimination by banks and thrift institutions against loan
applicants from poor and minority neighborhoods.
   By a 214-200 vote Thursday night, the House voted to include in
the $157 billion bailout a requirement that lenders disclose both
the number of loans they approve as well as the number of
applications they get by race, income and sex.
   ``We know redlining is a reality,'' said Rep. Ronald Dellums,
D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ``The banks
and savings and loans don't want this information to become public
because they know what it would do. It would provide the basis to
establish a national policy.''
   The amendment, written by Reps. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Rep. Joseph Kennedy,
D-Mass., also requires federal regulators to disclose their ratings
on how well banks and S&amp;Ls lend money for community needs.
   Civil rights and community activists have been demanding the
release to the public of numerical ratings the government keeps on
community lending in the wake of reports the past two years about
redlining in Atlanta, New York, Detroit, Dallas and other cities.
   Redlining is a practice by which banks and S&amp;Ls have used zip
codes and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to
residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of
minorities or poor people regardless of the creditworthiness of the
applicant.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said that without the provision,
minorities would reap no benefit from the savings and loan bailout.
   ``There is no way in the world I can go back to my constituency
and explain to them why redlining is still allowed in this
country,'' Conyers said. ``I can't stress enough the important
dimension of this civil rights amendment.''
   Opponents of the amendment, led by Reps. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas,
and Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, said they were against redlining but
argued that the issue had nothing to do with the bailout and should
be addressed in a separate bill.
   Wylie also called the measure ``mischievous,'' saying the ratings
could be misinterpreted by the public as an indication of the
financial soundness of a bank or S&amp;L rather than how much it helps
the local community.
   Both banks and regulators also have expressed fears that the
disclosures will be used by community and civil rights activists to
promote risky inner-city lending to borrowers who are not
creditworthy.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, attempted to add a similar
provision to the Senate's version of the S&amp;L bailout but withdrew it
in the face of overwhelming opposition. He promised that the issue
would be considered in a separate Senate bill.

<HEAD>Government Urges Use of Aerosal Drug to Prevent Pneumonia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials are recommending
aggressive use of a newly approved drug that protects people
infected with the AIDS virus against a form of pneumonia that is the
No.1 killer of AIDS victims.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, aerosol
pentamidine, on Thursday. The announcement came as the Centers for
Disease Control issued greatly expanded treatment guidelines
recommending wider use of the drug in people infected with the AIDS
virus but who may show no symptoms.
   Aerosol pentamidine has been widely available for several months
to people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
under a special FDA pre-approval distribution program. The cost of
the drug, however, is a burden for many.
   Full FDA approval means that more insurance companies will cover
at least part of the costs of the treatment, which runs about $150
for a monthly dose.
   Aerosol pentamidine, which is inhaled into the lungs, has been
found to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This form of
pneumonia kills more than 60 percent of AIDS patients.
   The injectable form of pentamidine was approved in 1984 for
patients already suffering from pneumocystis. But injections offered
far less protection than the inhalable, aerosol form.
   Approval of the drug may help about 100,000 AIDS-infected people
who are at risk of developing initial or subsequent bouts of
pneumocystis, said Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department
of Health and Human Services, parent agency of both the Food and
Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control.
   Aerosol pentamidine, to by marketed by LyphoMed Inc. of Rosemont,
Ill., will be labeled for use in patients who have had at least one
episode of pneumonia or whose immune systems have deteriorated
significantly, the FDA said.
   The government estimates that between 945,000 and 1.4 million
Americans are infected with the AIDS virus. About 120,000 people who
have been tested at public counseling and testing centers have been
informed that they are infected. The number of people who have been
found through other sources to be infected is not known, CDC said.
   CDC recommended that people who test positive for the virus, even
though they may have no symptoms of the disease, have critical
immune-system cells monitored every six months. These cells are
called CD4 helper lymphocyte cells, which in healthy people appear
at counts of about 1,000 or more.
   CDC also recommended that when the cell count drops below 200,
patients should be started on one of two drugs that have been shown
to protect against pneumocystis.
   ``The guidelines are likely to increase the demand for HIV
antibody testing by persons who believe they may be at risk for
infection,'' now that more can be done medically to prolong the
lives of AIDS patients, CDC said. More aggressive testing and
monitoring will also raise the demand for medical services, CDC said.
   The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report did not estimate
how much health care costs would increase with increased testing,
monitoring and administering of preventive drugs.
   Last week, at the Fifth International AIDS conference in
Montreal, Dr. James Mason, former CDC director who is now assistant
secretary for health, was quoted as saying increased monitoring of
HIV-infected people and use of AIDS drug treatments could cost $2
billion to $3 billion.

   Waiters at a well-known downtown restaurant
thought they were making pretty good tips until the IRS started
checking out the tabs.
   Checking just the credit card receipts for meals served by nine
waiters at the Palm Restaurant, the Internal Revenue Service found
that the nine failed to report nearly $145,000 in combined tip
income for each year between 1982 and 1985.
   As a result, the nine were charged with filing a false income tax
return. Eight of them pleaded guilty to one count each, and on
Thursday they were sentenced to serve nights and weekends at a
community correctional institute for up to four months.
   They also will have to pay back taxes, interest and penalties.
   ``This is probably the saddest day of my entire life,'' said
Joseph P. Levaca, one of the waiters. ``I want to apologize to the
court and keep my job so I can pay back this debt.''
   He and the other four waiters who still work at the Palm will be
able to continue doing so while serving their sentences.
   The ninth defendant, who now lives in California, also has
pleaded guilty and will be sentenced later.
   According to a pre-trial statement from prosecutors, the waiters
were reporting annual income ranging from $7,100 to $52,000 a year
while really earning $27,000 to $67,000. This did not include meals
paid for in cash.

   Ray Nestor, a onetime Kenyan farmer whose first
book of art was published on his 100th birthday, died June 5 in
Crowborough, a Sussex town 40 miles south of London, a friend said
today. No cause of death was given for Nestor, who would have been
101 in October.
   ``An African Sketchbook'' demonstrated watercolors and drawings
of Kenya's landscape, animals and people made during Nestor's years
in Kenya when he farmed in the Nandi hills. His pictures were
accompanied by extracts from his memoirs and those of his wife,
Dorothy.
   Elspeth Huxley, the novelist and writer on Africa who knew Nestor
wrote in The Independent newspaper that his drawings depicted an
Africa ``that has gone forever.''
   Nestor was an early conservationist, banning shooting, terracing
his land to prevent erosion and protecting his trees.
   Nestor went to Kenya from England in 1912 as a government
surveyor before taking up farming. He was badly wounded in the 1916
Somme battle in France in World War I. Nestor returned to England in
1949.
   Survivors and funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

<HEAD>Jury Decides in Favor of Uranium Plant Neighbors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury recommended in a mock trial to award
$136 million to neighbors of a federal uranium processing plant, a
decision the neighbors' lawyer hopes will lead to a settlement.
   The jury issued the non-binding verdict Thursday on the second
day of deliberations in a summary jury trial, an abbreviated
procedure used by U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel to encourage
a settlement of the neighbors' $300 million lawsuit.
   ``We won 100 percent. We didn't lose a single issue of law,''
said Stanley M. Chesley, a lawyer for the 14,000 plaintiffs
represented in the class-action lawsuit.
   The jury ruled that National Lead of Ohio Inc. operated the U.S.
Department of Energy's Feed Materials Production Center in a way
that caused neighbors to suffer emotional distress and lowered
property values. National Lead, which operated the plant under
contract to the federal government from 1951 through 1985, was sued
with its parent firm, National Lead Industries Inc.
   Chesley said he hopes the Energy Department, which represented
the defendant companies in the lawsuit, will now settle the civil
lawsuit. The plaintiffs all live within five miles of the plant in
Fernald, which is 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati.
   Henry Gill Jr., the Energy Department's chief lawyer, declined to
comment on a settlement, saying he would continue discussions with
Chesley and would need to confer with his superiors.
   If there is no settlement, the case goes to a real trial Aug. 15
before Spiegel.
   The 38-year-old plant processes uranium used by Energy Department
reactors elsewhere in producing nuclear weapons.
   Environmentalists have been watching the case in hopes that the
advisory verdict would affect other Energy Department installations
nationwide that are reputed to be polluters.
   Energy Department lawyers argued that the defendant companies
could not be found liable because they could only carry out the
government's orders.
   The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty
exhaust-air filters since the plant opened. Government lawyers said
the material has not endangered residents or harmed property.
   ``The jury believed they were reckless and careless the way they
managed this plant ... They didn't give a hoot about us or the
environment and now they are going to have to pay for it,'' said
Lisa Crawford, spokeswoman for the Fernald Residents for
Environmental Safety and Health.
   The jury recommended the damage amount would include $80 million
for a fund to monitor the residents' medical problems, $55 million
for punitive damages and $1 million for property damage.
   Jury foreman Robert Caplinger, questioned by the judge after
Thursday's verdict, said the jury thought its decision could help
persuade other contractors not to manage plants like National Lead
ran the Fernald facility.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio has operated the plant since
January 1986 and is not a defendant in the case.

   Surrounded by controversy, Premier Andreas
Papandreou faces the toughest test of his 25-year political career
in national elections Sunday.
   The results are expected to decide whether the 70-year-old former
U. S. university professor will continue dominating Greece's
often-turbulent politics or end his career on a discordant note.
   Papandreou first was elected in 1981 on an anti-American platform
and promises of significant social change. Instead, he and members
of his government have floundered since August over charges
involving a multimillion-dollar financial scandal and illegal arms
deals.
   Opponents often are critical of Papandreou's authoritarian style
and sensitivity to criticism. But they have not discounted him,
despite poor opinion poll ratings.
   ``He'll leave the country if he loses the election,'' said
opposition legislator Virginia Tsouderou of the center-right New
Democracy.
   Ms. Tsouderou claims Papandreou will leave whether his
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) gets second place or her
party wins an outright majority in the 300-member parliament.
   Papandreou said he will stay regardless.
   ``I know what it is to be in the opposition, I'm a fighter,'' he
said in a recent interview.
   But few political observers believe him, and even some party
members doubt him.
   ``Papandreou is too sensitive to sit in Parliament and listen to
criticism. If we lose, many of us in the party expect him to go, but
his magnetism could pull off a miracle'' agreed a Panhellenic deputy
running for re-election.
   He said Papandreou's style of ``one-man rule'' has alienated many
party members. Papandreou rarely showed up in Parliament, preferring
to govern from his suburban residence.
   ``We realize that without him PASOK would have little chance of
winning, but at the same time he could be a liability because of his
controversial private life and financial scandals we have been
burdened with,'' the deputy said on condition of anonymity.
   Harilaos Florakis, secretary-general of the Greek Communist
Party, believes Papandreou ``will be dumped as party leader if he
loses the election.''
   Observers speculate that if the Panhellenics loose their overall
majority, the elections would enable the Communist Party to play a
role in forming a new government.
   ``Despite statements by New Democracy and PASOK that they will
reject communist support to form a coalition government, anything
can happen,'' a West European diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
   Papandreou was dean of the economics department at the University
of California at Berkeley. He returned to Greece in 1959 after a
20-year absence.
   With his charismatic personality and gift for oratory, he used
his father's Center Union to form his own party following the
collapse of the military dictatorship that ruled Greece from
1967-1974.
   Papandreou concedes his popularity has diminished.
   He told the pro-government daily Ta Nea that the financial
scandal and his open affair with a flight attendant half his age
have affected his popularity.
   Papandreou divorced his American-born wife, Margaret, on June 9
ending their 38-year marriage. The divorce frees him to marry
Dimitra Liani, who critics charge influences his decisions.
   Papandreou admits he ``bounces his ideas off Liani because she
has good instinct. But I do not always follow her advice.''

<HEAD>Report Says Navy Wasting Billions in Intentional Sinkings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ocean floor is full of sunken treasure from
old military ships that have been blown up as targets or sunken as
artificial reefs, an investigative report says.
   Although there may be no doubloons or pieces of eight in the
newest denizens of Davy Jones's Locker, $17 million in recoverable
goods has been destroyed on board 24 ships sunk in recent years as
reefs or in target practice, the report by the Navy's inspector
general said.
   An additional $40 million will be lost unless something is done
to salvage items from 64 vessels that now await a similar fate, it
said.
   There are, in fact, ``significant amounts'' of gold and silver _
to be salvaged from communications and code equipment, the report
says.
   Mostly the wasted goods consist of power tools such as lathes,
drill presses, band saws, pumps and office and electronic equipment.
   Inspectors also said there were operating room and dental
equipment, including sterilizers; air conditioners and ice machines;
silverware; radios and teletypes; new mattresses, still in plastic
bags; and numerous spare parts.
   ``The Navy has been derelict in the proper management of the
public property under its control,'' the report concluded.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., who released the report,
introduced legislation on Thursday to permit outside contractors to
reclaim scrap items from such ships. They would apply for the right
to salvage items under sealed bids, Broomfield said.
   ``America may be the most wealthy nation in the world, but we are
not so wealthy that we can afford to dump millions of dollars worth
of sophisticated equipment to the bottom of the ocean floor,'' he
said in a statement.
   The Navy continues to buy some of the same items it has wasted,
the inspector general's report said, and ``has ignored the
possibility of re-usage.''
   In a response, the service said it is ``reviewing the report to
determine any appropriate action. This will include reviewing the
cost estimates of the unrecovered materials, plus the associated
recovery costs, equipment condition and applicability to current
needs.''
   The Navy added that it ``also plans to review its instructions
governing the process and procedures for inactivating and stripping
ships.''
   The internal investigation was prompted by a complaint from
William R. Justen, whose Stuart, Fla., company had been hired to
sink an old Navy ship under the artificial reef program.
   Justen complained that some $300,000 worth of reusable items were
on the vessel, but he was unable to salvage them because of the time
constraints of his contract. He told the Navy that he was aware of
other, similar cases, as well.
   The inspector general found confusion in the handling of
decommissioned ships and few clear provisions for salvage.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Nationalist Defiant During Sentencing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER VILES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defiant to the end, a Harvard-educated
Puerto Rican nationalist raised his fist and shouted ``Puerto Rico
Libre'' after he was sentenced to 65 years in prison and fined
$500,000.
   Juan Segarra Palmer, who has already spent almost three years in
jail awaiting trial on charges of masterminding a $7.1 million
robbery at a Wells Fargo depot, expressed no remorse during a
politically charged, 27-minute speech before U.S. District Judge T.
Emmet Clarie on Thursday.
   ``My conscience is clear,'' he told the judge. ``In my limited
capacity I tried to bring about change.''
   The 39-year-old Segarra, who had faced up to 165 years in prison,
was convicted with three other Puerto Rican nationalists in April in
the 1983 theft of a half-ton of money from the armored-car company's
depot in West Hartford.
   Only $80,000 has been recovered from what is believed to be the
second-largest cash heist in U.S. history.
   After Clarie announced the sentence, Segarra turned to supporters
in the packed courtroom and shouted the separatist slogan. About two
dozen spectators responded with shouts of encouragement as Segarra
was led from the courtroom.
   Before his sentencing, Segarra denounced U.S. policy and pledged
to continue fighting for Puerto Rican independence.
   ``I will keep my eyes on the prize because no price is too high
to pay for freedom, justice and the dignity of the people,'' he said.
   The judge replied: ``Common crimes do not become political crimes
simply because the criminal is a would-be politician.''
   Clarie also denied Segarra's charge that democracy is a sham in
Puerto Rico and that the island is little more than a U.S. colony.
The judge pointed to a recent referendum in which only 3 percent of
Puerto Rican voters supported independence from the United States.
   Segarra, convicted of charges including robbery, transportation
of stolen money and conspiracy, denied he helped plan the Wells
Fargo robbery, as the prosecution alleged.
   But he has acknowledged that he knew about the robbery in advance
and said he received the stolen money to finance the activities of
Los Macheteros, Spanish for ``the machete wielders,'' a militant
Puerto Rican separatist group.
   He and other defendants have said the government prosecuted them
because of their political beliefs.
   Prosecutors pushed for the maximum sentence, saying Segarra was
linked to several crimes in Puerto Rico, including two bank
robberies, an attack on a Navy bus that left two sailors dead and
the destruction of nine military planes worth $45 million.
   Segarra's lawyer, Leonard Weinglass, said he would appeal.
   Segarra will be eligible for parole in 10 years, but probably
will not be given serious consideration until he has served 20
years, Weinglass said.
   Earlier this month, Clarie imposed sentences of up to 15 years on
the three others convicted with Segarra.
   In all, 16 people have been charged in the heist. One was
acquitted; two, including Segarra's wife, Luz Berrios Berrios,
pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and nine are awaiting trial.
   None were accused of actually taking part in the holdup; Victor
Gerena, a Wells Fargo security guard at the time, is believed to
have taken the money and fled to Cuba with about $2 million.

<HEAD>Second Thunderstorm Leaves More Residents Without Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An area still recovering from a devastating
thunderstorm was hit by showers and high winds for a second day in a
row, hampering efforts to clean up trees and leaving an additional
22,000 homes without power in the nation's capital and suburban
Maryland.
   The second storm swept through the area late Thursday afternoon,
creating havoc with rush-hour commuters for the second time in 24
hours. To make matters worse, dozens of traffic signals were out as
a result of Wednesday's storm, which caused an estimated 150,000
power outages and felled hundred of trees.
   Virginia Electric Power Co. spokeswoman Deborah Tompkins said an
estimated 12,600 homes in the northern section of the state were
without power at the height of the storm, around 6 p.m.
   Tom Welle, a Potomac Electric Co. spokesman, said the second
storm, not as strong as the first, hampered efforts to repair the
damage caused by the initial thundershower, which he said was the
most disruptive in the company's 93-year history.
   ``We have to rebuild almost all of the electrical system from
scratch,'' Welle said. ``At this rate, some people will probably be
without power through the weekend.''
   Pepco was giving out dry ice at two locations for people who
owned freezers filled with food that was thawing.
   Even before the new storm, hundreds of trees still blocked side
streets and were wrapped around felled power lines. City and county
police directed traffic at key intersections where traffic lights
were malfunctioning.
   Insurance industry analysts said private storm-related claims had
already passed the $5 million mark, and would likely climb much
higher.
   About 30 area schools were closed Thursday, due to the outages,
and at least 16 were to remain closed today. Three UHF television
stations, WETA, WHMM and WDCA, which share the same transmitter
site, remained off the air Thursday. WDCA still had not returned to
the air early this morning.
   PEPCO spokeswoman Eileen Griffin said about 300 crews were
working around the clock to restore electricity. The utility was
forced to call outside crews from as far as North Carolina to assist
them in the effort.

   Students at an elementary school have
donated $1,000 in pennies collected for a class project towards the
medical expenses of a teacher who needs a liver transplant.
   The money was donated by students at the Langley Park-McCormick
Elementary School for Mary Alliata, who teaches at nearby Ridgecrest
Elementary School.
   Alliata suffers from a blockage of her bile ducts and needs the
transplant to survive. Her medical expenses are expected to be about
$200,000.
   Teacher Les Greenblatt organized the penny drive originally as a
class project to see if the school's students could raise a million
pennies. But, when the students realized they would not be able to
meet the goal, Greenblatt said they decided to give the money to a
good cause.
   ``I think it's really wonderful that these children can do
that,'' Alliata said. ``It's very touching.''

<TEXT>
   Mass mailings by 100 senators during 1987-88
cost taxpayers more than $52.7 million, the congressional watchdog
Common Cause says in a report.
   The 27 senators seeking re-election last year spent $20.1 million
of the total, an average of 48 cents per household, according to the
Common Cause study released Thursday. The per-household figures
compared to an average of 31 cents for the 67 senators who were not
campaigning for re-election, and 15 cents for six senators who
retired in 1988.
   The study said taxpayer-financed mailing costs for both houses
have increased from $48.9 million in fiscal 1978 to $113.4 million
for fiscal 1988.

   Federal engineers have opened investigations
into reports of safety defects in up to 200,000 Subaru cars and
Nissan trucks, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
says.
   The investigations, both preliminary evaluations, involve
complaints of engine fires in 1987 Subaru DL and GL models and
complaints of steering problems in 1987 to 1989 Nissan pickup
trucks. Preliminary evaluation is the lowest level of investigation
conducted by NHTSA engineers when they receive complaints.
   NHTSA said the government received five complaints from Subaru
owners of engine compartment fires. It estimated that 67,000 of the
cars are on U.S. roads.
   NHTSA, in its monthly Defect Investigation Report, also announced
an upgrade of its investigation involving more than 640,000 Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable 1986 and 1987 cars. An engineering analysis
will be conducted into the possibility of broken or cracked front
seat brackets in the cars, following 68 complaints received by Ford
Motor Co. and the government.

   The Federal Communications Commission has
reaffirmed its decision to allocate to land mobile radio service a
frequency band that previously had been available to amateur radio
operators.
   The commission's August 1988 action had been appealed by the
American Radio Relay League and about 700 other amateur radio
organizations and individual ham radio operators. David Sumner,
ARRL's executive vice president, said the league plans further
appeals in federal court.
   At Thursday's meeting, the FCC stood by its decision to maintain
the 216-220 MHz band for maritime mobile communications, allocate
the 220-222 MHz band _ which earlier had been available to amateurs
_ to land mobile service and allocate the 222-225 MHz band
exclusively to amateur service. A number of other frequency bands

   Just a week into the post-primary season, New
Jersey's gubernatorial candidates flocked to their party's biggest
Washington names in search of valuable support and solidarity.
   Both finished the day Thursday with promises of campaign
appearances.
   Democratic Rep. James Florio posed inside a Capitol dining room
with newly elected House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., who said he
expected to stump in the Garden State for his congressional
colleague.
   Hours later, Republican Rep. James Courter emerged smiling from
beneath a White House portico after a meeting with President Bush.
   Asked if the support Bush was offering Courter, combined with the
popularity of outgoing Republican Gov. Thomas Kean, would make the
race difficult for a Democrat, Foley said, ``We think the tradition
of progressive leadership in New Jersey is a Jim Florio tradition.''
   The phrase ``progressive leadership'' came out again in Courter's
recounting of the session with Bush, First Lady Barbara Bush and New
Jersey's new GOP Chairwoman Kathleen Donovan.

<HEAD>Europarliament Vote: Good News for Opposition, Bad News for Thatcher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party won two parliamentary
by-elections today and, according to an exit poll, inflicted
stunning defeats on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives
in elections for the European Parliament.
   Results early today from voting to fill two vacant House of
Commons seats showed Labor holding on to the inner-city socialist
strongholds of Scotland's Glasgow Central and London's Vauxhall
district.
   ``The government is in trouble,'' Labor campaign manager Bryan
Gould declared. ``We have just started to see the beginning of a
major shift in the underlying political agenda.''
   Labor tried to turn the European campaign into a referendum on
Mrs. Thatcher's 10 years in office.
   Kenneth Clarke, Health Secretary in Mrs. Thatcher's government,
blamed economic problems and the mid-term protest votes for the
Conservatives' apparent defeats.
   ``But we've seen worse than this,'' said Clarke, arguing the
Conservatives would recover before the next general election, which
must be held by mid-1992.
   For her part, she told voters they should reject minimum-wage and
other proposals of the European Economic Community that would
introduce ``socialism by the back door.''
   The exit poll gave the tiny environmental Green Party third place
in national voting for the first time.
   Official results are not due until early Monday, when voting for
the 518-member body is complete in all 12 member nations of the
European Economic Community.
   The computerized British Broadcasting Corp. poll of 7,500 voters
showed Labor with 44 percent of the European vote, its best showing
in more than a decade. The Conservatives took 32 percent.
   Those percentages would allow Labor to win 51 of 78 seats
allocated to the British mainland in the European Parliament, up
from the party's previous 32. The government's tally dropped from 26
from 45, according to the poll.
   The Scottish National Party gained one seat, the poll said.
   The Greens followed with 14 percent, according to the poll. The
centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party finished with 6
percent, the poll said. Such percentages would not give either of
those two parties any seats on the European body.
   Minor parties captured the rest of the votes.
   The poll was conducted for the BBC by National Opinion Poll.
   In Vauxhall, Labor's Kate Hoey won with a 9,766-vote majority,
slightly more than the 1987 general election. The Conservative vote
was down 10 percent at 5,425 votes, only 382 ahead of the centrist
Social and Liberal Democratic Party.
   In Glasgow Central, Labor's majority slumped by nearly two-thirds
to 6,462, eroded by the Scottish National Party.
   Laborite Michael Watson's 14,480 votes was a 10 percent drop,
while the Scottish nationalist share was up 20 percent. The
Conservatives ran third in the mainly working class district,
getting 2,028 votes.
   The by-elections were called after the death of the previous
Glasgow Central legislator and the retirement of the one in Vauxhall.
   Mrs. Thatcher's party retains a huge majority in the 650-member
House of Commons. The Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 229, the
Social and Liberal Democrats 19, and the splinter Social Democratic
Party three. The Scottish nationalists have four seats, and minority
regional parties control the rest.
   In his comments, Gould said the Conservatives were hurt by Mrs.
Thatcher's resistance to greater European unity and her often
combative stance in the trade bloc.
   ``Now we see we are paying a price for Mrs. Thatcher picking
fights with everybody,'' said Gould.
   In addition to benefiting from high interest rates of 14 percent
and unemployment of 6.4 percent, Labor has also been helped by a
new, more centrist platform. Its plan drops the party's previous
call for scrapping Britain's nuclear arsenal unilaterally and
shutting down U.S. nuclear bases.

   A monthlong search for the last three
crossbred dusky seaside sparrows, which had escaped from captivity
during a storm, revealed no traces of the birds, and ornithologists
are convinced the species is extinct.
   The quest by federal biologists ended Wednesday, two years to the
day after the death of the last known pure dusky seaside sparrow, a
small brown-and-white bird with a short buzzing trill.
   ``You can't come to any other conclusion because there's no
habitat around here for them,'' said Herb Kale, vice president for
ornithology at the Florida Audubon Society.
   By the 1950s, the birds' salt marsh habitat near the St. Johns
River in central Florida was rapidly being consumed by development.
Pesticides sprayed to control mosquitoes also hurt the birds.
   In 1966, the dusky seaside sparrow became the first species on
the federal government's endangered species list.
   Kale became an adviser to a Disney World program that had tried
since 1983 to mate the crossbred birds with a related species.
   But that program was devastated in March, when a storm pitched a
palm frond through the fiberglass roof of the birds' compound and
left a hole. When keepers arrived the next morning, they found one
crossbred sparrow dead and two others gone.
   Another stayed in its cage during the storm, but flew off when
keepers tried to put it in a more secure cage.
   The birds were born in captivity. They knew their natural salt
marsh habitat only through careful recreations, so the birds are
presumed dead.
   The federal government bought the 6,000-acre St. Johns River
National Wildlife Refuge in Brevard County to protect the species in
1972.
   ``Some would argue that we lost a scientific opportunity to learn
something, although we've had those birds in captivity a fairly long
time and learned about everything we could,'' said Don Wood,
endangered species coordinator for the Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission.
   ``In an ecological sense, it's an absolutely totally
insignificant loss,'' Wood said. ``In the philosophical sense, it
would depend on whoever's talking to you.''
   One last aerial survey of the salt marshes might be made today.
   But if no dusky sparrow is found, paperwork will be filed to have
it removed from the federal endangered species list because it is
extinct.

<TEXT>
   Ireland began counting ballots today from
its snap national election, but politicians are already threatening
to force another contest.
   A heavy turnout was reported Thursday as Ireland also selected
members of the European Parliament. Counting for the European
Parliament begins Sunday.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey called the election in hope of
winning a majority in the Dail, or parliament, which would be his
first in five tries.
   Leaders of the other parties offered no support.
   Alan Dukes of the Fine Gael Party and Des O'Malley, leader of the
Progressive Democrats, declared on the eve of the election that they
would not vote for Haughey for another term.
   The Labor Party and the Workers Party also ruled out any support
for the 63-year-old Haughey and his Fianna Fail Party, in part
because of economic problems in Ireland.
   That raised the possibility of a split parliament, requiring yet
another election to break the impasse.
   Haughey needed 83 seats to gain control of the 26th Dail, which
has 166 members. The speaker customarily votes with the government
and is automatically elected.
   Fianna Fail controlled 80 seats when the 25th Dail was dissolved.
   Even if Haughey musters a majority, or woos enough independents
and minor party deputies to form a government, the cooperation that
marked the 25th parliament appeared to be shattered.
   Fine Gael and the Progressive Democratic party had supported
Haughey on his main economic policies.
   But the day before the election, a spokesman for those two
parties said Haughey could expect no help, ``in view of him having
cast aside the historic and unique consensus he and his government
enjoyed in the last Dail.''

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted a base operated by
Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal at dawn today in twin bombing runs.
Two children were reported wounded.
   Six U.S.-built Skyhawk jets swooped down for the raid on the
beachside Rashidiyeh refugee camp, police said.
   An army spokesman in Israel said the planes hit all the targets.
The spokesman said the base that was bombed had been used to launch
guerrilla attacks against Israel and its self-declared security zone
in southern Lebanon. The camp is 10 miles north of the Israeli
border.
   A spokesman for Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council said only
that Israeli warplanes bombed positions of his group within the camp.
   A police spokesman said a 5-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy
were wounded in a two-story house. A nursery was also hit, but it
had not yet opened for the day and no one was injured there, he said.
   No casualty figure at the military base was immediately available.
   Lebanese police initially said the target was a base for the
Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. However, they
later corrected that report, saying the base belonged to Nidal's
group.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri Banna, split from Yasir
Arafat's mainstream Fatah group of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in 1973. Three years later, he formed his underground
group.
   He has since been blamed for dozens of terrorist attacks across
Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
   The attacks include simultaneous assaults at Rome and Vienna
airports in 1985 that killed 20 people.
   Nidal guerrillas also were held responsible for seizing a Pan
American jumbo jet Sept. 5 at an airport in Karachi, Pakistan. The
terrorists opened fire inside the aircraft, killing 20 people.
   Today's attack was Israel's eighth on Lebanon this year. By
police count, nine people have been killed and 58 wounded in the
previous raids beginning Jan. 11.
   On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes bombed a guerrilla hideout used
by the Marxist Popular Front and three other radical Palestinian
factions in the Chouf mountains southeast of Beirut. Three
guerrillas were killed and nine wounded in that attack.

   Japan, the world's largest importer of ivory, will
ban most of those shipments in keeping with international calls to
protect African elephants, government officials said today.
   Their pledge came one day after Canadian officials said they too
would ban ivory imports into their country.
   The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry said
the Japanese ban will take effect Monday.
   It will exclude, however, raw African ivory that has been
specially certified under an international agreement. Such ivory
accounts for about 13 percent of the imports.
   Japan is following the lead of the majority of industrial nations
that already banned ivory imports, Ministry official Toru Takimoto
told The Associated Press.
   President Bush announced June 5 that the United States was
banning the import of ivory from all countries.
   Japan accounts for 40 percent of all world ivory consumption,
followed by the United States at 15 percent. In 1988, Japan imported
132 tons of ivory.
   The Japanese use ivory mainly for seals that can make impressions
on documents, musical instruments and jewelry.
   The Japanese ban complies with a 1973 international agreement to
protect animals threatened by extinction by restricting trade in
such animals and products made from them.
   African producers certify their ivory under rules of that
agreement.
   However, more than 80 percent of Japan's ivory imports come from
non-African countries, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Belgium.
Most of that ivory lacks such certification.
   Though some African countries still permit limited exports of the
certified ivory, four major producers _ Kenya, Tanzania, Gambia and
Somalia _ have called for a total ban on trade in ivory. They say
such action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population of
African elephants.
   The population of African elephants in 1988 was estimated at
625,000, down from 1.2 million in 1981, according to the World
Wildlife Fund.
   Tamotsu Ishibashi, chairman of Tokyo Ivory and Craft Cooperative
Association, said the ban will hurt Japan's traditional
ivory-carving industry.
   ``The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of
carving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restriction
certainly will affect them severely,'' Ishibashi said in a telephone
interview.
   About 25,000 ivory craftsman work in 80 Japanese workshops,
producing $13.8 million worth of ivory products every year.
   Ishibashi predicted Japan's ivory imports would drop to 15-20
percent of the amount now imported.
   ``Of course, prices of ivory products will skyrocket soon, and
ivory products will no longer be for ordinary people,'' he said.
   In announcing the Canadian ban, External Affairs Minister Joe
Clark said his government intended ``to discourage any further
speculative slaughter of these magnificent animals.''
   Canada will also support an international ban on commercial
trading in African elephant ivory.

   The University of Colorado will keep open
its invitation to Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi to serve as a
visiting fellow even though the Chinese government revoked his
travel plans.
   Fang, 53, and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge June 5 in the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing after the Chinese government cracked down on
students demonstrating for democracy.
   The two were targeted by the Beijing prosecutor's office, which
said their presence inside the embassy would heighten tensions
between China and the United States.
   The university's Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics
invited Fang, an astrophysicist, to participate in a six-month
fellowship from December 1988 to May 1989. The school invited Fang
on Feb. 11, 1988, and he accepted the fellowship eight days later.
He was expected to arrive Dec. 1.
   But Chinese officials stepped in and Fang notified the institute
by letter in October that permission for him to leave China had been
withdrawn.
   ``The reasons are completely political,'' the letter said.
   Because Fang is so prestigious in the field of astrophysics, the
institute said will keep the fellowship invitation open for three
years, hoping Fang will be allowed to travel within that period,
according to Chairman Peter Conti.

<HEAD>Northeast Summer Drought Now Remote, But Florida Reports Water Shortages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Northeast's rains this spring have filled reservoirs, making
the possibility of a summer drought remote, but Florida residents
have been asked to conserve water due to sparse rainfall.
   Officials have placed all of Florida except the Panhandle under
some water-use restrictions. Most restrictions are voluntary, but
many south and central areas of the state have banned lawn watering.
   In the Northeast, an unusually dry winter brought drought
emergency regulations. But since then many areas received record
amounts of rain.
   Now the reservoirs are nearly full.
   ``It just goes to show that weather is a fickle thing,'' said
Christopher Roberts of the Delaware River Basin Commission on
Thursday. ``One month you're in a drought, the next month you have
rivers and streams overflowing their banks. It's just a whimsical
element you're dealing with.''
   A drought warning issued Jan. 16 for 7 million people in
Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania who depend on the
Delaware River basin ended May 12, thanks to the spring rain.
   New York City declared a drought emergency in March after a dry
winter dropped reservoirs to 55 percent capacity. City reservoirs
are now at 97.1 percent capacity and the city has ended the drought
emergency.
   Massachusetts officials announced Tuesday that they were easing
restrictions but stopped short of declaring a formal end to the
drought emergency for the 2.5 million people in Boston and 43
surrounding communities that get water from the Quabbin Reservoir.

<HEAD>Belgian Sheepdog Who Understands Only French Escapes At Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Korsair leaped from a cart at O'Hare
International Airport, ``sit,'' ``stay,'' and ``heel'' fell on deaf
ears.
   The 3-year-old Belgian sheepdog, a champion show dog valued as
high as $50,000, escaped and is still missing, and he understands
only French.
   Korsair's owner, Frenchman Daniel Paul, said Thursday that when
he transferred Monday from a flight from San Francisco to a flight
to Lansing, Mich., he thought his best friend was safely with him.
   But United Airlines spokesman Rob Doughty said that at some point
during the transfer the cage door flew open and Korsair leaped from
the cart and bounded across airplane taxi lanes into a field.
   United personnel chased the dog in their cargo carts until they
became bogged down in the rain-soaked field. They cornered Korsair
once, but the dog snarled and bared its teeth before escaping,
Doughty said.
   The handlers tried to order the dog using standard English
commands, but the dog did not understand, he said.
   ``We train our people to handle animals, making sure they're
comfortable and out of the heat,'' Doughty said, ``but not how to
give commands in French.''
   At least one person per shift is assigned to search for the dog,
said Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of
Aviation. O'Hare's fenced-in complex encompasses 7,000 acres.
   Paul values Korsair at $20,000 because of pedigree, stud value
and championship record, and his ranking as one of France's top
obedience champions. Louis Auslander, chairman of the American
Kennel Club and president of the International Kennel Club of
Chicago, said the dog may be worth up to $50,000.

<HEAD>8,000 Weapons Seized in Uzbek Riots, Two More Bodies Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Troops have seized thousands of weapons since a
curfew was imposed nearly two weeks ago to quell ethnic violence in
Uzbekistan, and the death toll rose with the discovery of two more
bodies, Tass reported today.
   Tass, the official news agency, said troops had confiscated 157
firearms and steel weapons as well as 26 firebombs during road
checks in the last 24 hours. A total of 7,718 weapons have now been
confiscated.
   Meanwhile the remains of two people were discovered and added to
the list of at least 100 victims, Tass said. On Thursday, the agency
quoted Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov as saying that at least 100 people
had died during the turmoil that began June 3.
   More than 1,000 buildings have been looted and burned since the
brutal rampage against the Meskhi Turk minority began in the Fergana
Valley about 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, the agency reported.
   At least 1,500 people have been detained for violating the 10
p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew that went into effect on June 4, the military
newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda reported.
   Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov has dispatched two deputies of
parliament to prepare a report for the Council of Nationalities,
which will investigate the tragedy, Tass said.
   The spasm of gang violence in Uzbekistan is a case of ethnic
hatred being exploited for political gain, Ryzhkov told Uzbek party
activists at a meeting in Tashkent on Thursday, Tass reported
earlier.
   Ryzhkov and former KGB chief Victor Chebrikov, now the Kremlin`s
top law-and-order official, wound up a four-day investigation of the
rampage against the Meskhi Turk minority Thursday, Tass said.
   ``This was the work of ruthless and cruel hands of those to whom
inter-ethnic enmity had always been the soil for the criminal
mentality that everything goes,'' Tass quoted Ryzhkov as telling
party officials. ``Corruption and shady economic and political
dealings'' played a role, he said.
   Ryzhkov said the violence was well-planned and aimed at
destabilizing the republic and the country. He did not identify any
group or people he held responsible.
   At another party meeting Wednesday near Fergana, the city hit
hardest by the unrest, Ryzhkov said party and government officials
gave gasoline, transportation and vodka to attackers who killed
Meskhi Turks.
   Uzbek militants have said that unemployment and poor food
supplies caused anger that was vented in ethnic violence.
   The late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin forced the Meskhi Turk
minority to leave their homeland in Soviet Georgia in 1944 and
resettle in Uzbekistan.
   They now number about 300,000, and Ryzhkov said on Tuesday that a
special commission would consider their request to return to Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Three U.S. soldiers were killed when the
military helicopter they were riding in crashed near the Panama
Canal, but a U.S. Embassy spokesman said the accident did not
involve any hostile fire.
   ``We don't know why or how'' the accident occurred, U.S. Embassy
spokesman Terry Kneebone said Thursday, adding only that the crash
of the OH-58 helicopter ``apparently was an accident.''
   The helicopter went down about 2 p.m., Kneebone said. The
helicopter and all three aboard belonged to the 7th Light Infantry
Division from Fort Ord, Calif.
   Names of the victims were withheld pending notification of their
families.
   The division was among about 1,900 troops sent to Panama
following the government's nullification of the May 7 elections and
post-election violence in which three opposition candidates were
beaten.
   When the helicopter crashed, it was serving as an escort for a
military convoy transporting troops between Fort Clayton, on the
Pacific side of the Canal, to Fort Sherman, on the Atlantic,
Kneebone said.
   The U.S. Southern Command said the helicopter went down near a
road in the town of Chilibre, about 21 miles north of Panama City,
and that it is investigating the crash.
   He said the accident caused the temporary suspension of traffic
linking Panama City with the nearby city of Colon.
   The helicopter, also known as the Kiowa, is made by Bell.

<HEAD>Man Freed From Armed Robbery Charge Because of Facial Blemish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was held in jail for three months and
lost his job after being charged with armed robbery was cleared
because of a small facial blemish.
   Robert Lynn Witner, 43, was set free Thursday after his lawyer,
Joseph Licata, persuaded authorities that the robber photographed by
a surveillance camera had no such blemish.
   District Court Judge Frank Price dismissed the two aggravated
robbery charges against Witner, who has a small, reddish mole on his
lower right cheek. Assistant District Attorney Mark Vinson examined
pictures of the man in the robbery videotape and of Witner. He
noticed other differences, including different-shaped ears, he said.
   ``They look very, very similar,'' Vinson said. ``If a mole ever
helped a man, it helped him.''
   Witner called the experience a nightmare.
   ``It's a sickening feeling. You tell these people, `I'm not the
person you want.' And they look at you and think you're guilty,'''
Witner said.
   Witner said an officer stopped him for a routine traffic
violation in March and told him he was under arrest for aggravated
robbery.
   ``I came unglued,'' he said.
   Witner said he lost his job because his employer, an asbestos
removal company, wouldn't accept a collect telephone call when he
tried to call and explain his situation. He spent 90 days in jail,
unable to pay $40,000 bond.
   He said he came down with bronchitis in the jail and his weight
dropped from 165 pounds to less than 100 pounds.
   The CitGo convenience store was robbed in November and December
1988, and the robber was caught on camera. The robberies were shown
on a local television program and Harris County Detective Tom Keen
received a tip that the man was Witner. He showed Witner's picture
to the two clerks who had been robbed and they positively identified
him, Keen said.
   It was not known why Witner had not been arrested earlier.
   Witner said he had an appointment last year to have a doctor
remove the mole, but changed his mind.
   ``I'm glad I did,'' he said. ``It's going to stay where it's at.
I've had it since I was born, and I'll have it when I go.''

<HEAD>Acclaimed Irish Actor, Cardinal in `The Mission,' Dead at 63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ray McAnally, the Irish character actor
who won acclaim for his portrayal of the cardinal in the 1986 movie
``The Mission,'' died at his home in Ireland. He was 63.
   Police said he died Thursday night, but gave no cause. Irish
newspapers said he had undergone a heart bypass operation several
years ago, and collapsed at his cottage in County Wicklow shortly
after voting in Thursday's general election.
   McAnally was one of the most accomplished character actors on
British and Irish stage and screen in recent years.
   Born in County Donegal, Ireland, he was a stalwart of Dublin's
famous Abbey Theater when, in his 50's, he began to gain a wider
audience through cinema and television.
   Chameleon-like in his ability to shape himself into a role, he
was the cultured Cardinal Altimirano in ``The Mission,'' about
Christian missionaries in 18th-century South America; the hard-edged
Protestant work boss in the movie ``Cal,'' about Northern Ireland's
conflict; and the dissolute Englishman Rick Pym in the TV
serialization of John le Carre's ``A Perfect Spy.''
   He scored an unusual double in 1987 when he won the Evening
Standard Film Award for best actor in both ``The Mission'' and ``No
Surrender,'' a black comedy about elderly, feuding Northern
Irelanders.
   McAnally also won kudos in the role of a blue-collar Yorkshireman
who becomes prime minister in last year's TV series, ``A Very
British Coup.'' Both ``Coup'' and `A Perfect Spy'' were seen PBS-TV
last season.
   Last year, he brought George Bernard Shaw vividly to life on the
London stage, playing the great playwright opposite Sir John Gielgud
in the hit ``The Best of Friends.''
   He recently filmed ``Venus Peter,'' about a 1950's Scottish
village, and a television serialization of Charles Dickens' ``Great
Expectations.''
   McAnally made his stage debut at 18, acted in numerous
Shakespearean parts, and played more than 150 roles at the Abbey
from 1947 to 1963. He also spent time with the Royal Shakespeare
Company in London.
   Entering movies in 1938, he played supporting roles in ``Billy
Budd,'' and ``Shake Hands with the Devil,'' but only with ``The
Mission'' did he begin to make his name internationally.
   ``He sank himself into the character he was playing. Because of
that he played whatever character it was with tremendous belief,
conviction and extraordinary detail,'' said actress Vanessa Redgrave.
   Robert Carrickford, president of the Irish actors' union, called
him ``one of the finest character actors Ireland has ever produced.''
   McAnally was separated from his wife, actress Ronnie Masterson.
His sons, Conor and Aoghus, and daughters Maire and Niamh, were with
him when he died, police said.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Thrash East Coast; Tornado Hits Pennsylvania</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Powerful thunderstorms thrashed much of the eastern seaboard,
downing trees and power lines and spawning a tornado that injured
seven people in Pennsylvania.
   The storms developed Thursday evening in warm, moist air that
stretched from Florida to Pennsylvania. A funnel cloud touched down
in York County in southern Pennsylvania, destroying seven houses and
damaging six others across a 15-mile area, authorities reported.
   Michael Herr said he got his wife and two children into the
basement just before the tornado leveled their Manor Township home.
   ``The whole house just started shaking. In 30 seconds it was over
with,'' he said. ``The whole thing was gone.''
   Seven people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries.
   The tornado and associated thunderstorms knocked out power to
about 9,000 consumers in York and Lancaster counties, power
companies reported.
   Another round of thunderstorms in the Washington, D.C., area
hampered efforts to recover from Wednesday's big storm. An
additional 34,000 homes were left without power in the area, on top
of the 150,000 affected by the previous day's storm.
   Thunderstorm winds downed trees and power lines across much of
Florida, cutting power to 15,000 homes alone in Duval County, which
contains Jacksonville. The storms also damaged a half-dozen mobile
homes near Arcadia in south-central Florida.
   Strong storm winds also downed trees in Alabama, the Carolinas
and Virginia, where gusts reached up to 80 mph at Norfolk. In New
Jersey, winds gusted to 60 mph at Cumberland and blew the roof off a
house in Glassboro.
   Hail was widespread, with stones up to an inch in diameter
hitting Florida, South Carolina and Pennsylvania.
   This morning, showers and thunderstorms stretched from northwest
Florida to northern Georgia, and were over eastern South Carolina
and along the mid-Atlantic coast. Showers prevailed from the upper
Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes across New England.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were continuing over Idaho and
western Montana this morning after severe storms whipped the
northern Rockies Thursday.
   Storms in southern Idaho dropped 1{ inch hail north of Cascade,
breaking some car windows, and winds gusted to 87 mph in Oneida
County. A thunderstorm in western Montana dropped 1{ inch hail at
Holter Dam.
   The first tropical depression of the season formed in the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico Thursday evening, about 440 miles east
of Tampico, Mexico.
   Today's forecast called for widespread showers and thunderstorms
from the eastern Great Lakes across New England, the upper Ohio
Valley, the Appalachians and the Atlantic Coast into northern and
central Florida. Showers and thunderstorms, some heavy, were
expected from the western and central Carolinas into the Florida
Panhandle. Rain also was expected to be widespread across the
northern Rockies, Idaho and western parts of Washington and Oregon.
Showers and isolated thunderstorms were possible across the northern
and central Plains.
   Predicted highs: 60s along the central and northern Pacific Coast
into the northern Rockies, and from the Great Lakes into northern
New England; 90s in the central California valleys, much of Nevada
and Utah, and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and the central North
Carolina coast and much of the Florida Peninsula; and 100 to 110 in
the desert Southwest.
   Highs in the 70s and 80s were expected elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EDT ranged from 40 degrees at Duluth,
Minn., to 95 at Phoenix.

   Sheila Hawkins knew something was amiss
when Bentley, her 5-year-old miniature Yorkshire terrier, turned up
missing.
   Ms. Hawkins said she knew from the beginning that her dog had not
just run away. ``I was just hoping whoever had him wouldn't mistreat
him,'' she said.
   Ronnie Blackwell, 18, found his neighbor's missing dog and later
was arrested with three others and charged with conspiracy to commit
extortion. Blackwell allegedly tried to force the owner to up the
reward to $200 and set up a drop at a gas station.
   But his intent wasn't malicious, officials said.
   Blackwell told police he had grown fond of the shaggy little dog
he said he found near the Spartanburg Library last week. After
inquiring about how much the dog's owner was prepared to pay for its
return, he apparently decided to keep the dog.
   ``He said he had become really attached to the dog and felt if he
kept upping the price the lady would just think the dog wasn't worth
it,'' said Detective Audrey McNair of the Spartanburg Police
Department.
   Bentley had been missing since June 8. Three days later, Ms.
Hawkins received a call from a man who said he had the dog and would
bring him to her house for the $50 reward she had promised on
fliers, authorities said.
   He never arrived.
   Instead, a woman called three different times Sunday and told Ms.
Hawkins, ``We have the dog,'' and that the $50 reward was not
enough, police said.
   During one phone call, a man said the captors wanted $200,
according to police.
   Ms. Hawkins agreed to the price, but the dog was not returned.
   During one of the phone calls Sunday, a woman identified herself
as a mother whose son had found the dog and was very attached to
him. Ms. McNair said the caller was Blackwell's girlfriend, Rebecca
Entsminger, 18, who was also charged with conspiracy to commit
extortion.
   Ms. Hawkins, a 30-year-old hair stylist, said Wednesday she
offered to give the callers a puppy the next time she had Bentley
bred. But they were not interested, she said.
   A relative of one of the captors saw a television news report
Tuesday about the missing dog and apparently convinced the four to
return it, authorities said. They called Ms. Hawkins to say they
would give Bentley back that night.
   Ms. Hawkins got a call Tuesday night telling her to go to a local
gasoline station to get her dog.
   Ms. McNair, who was at Ms. Hawkins' home at the time of the call,
rode with her to the station, where three suspects were arrested and
the dog was recovered in good condition. Miss Entsminger was later
arrested when she came to the police station.
   Also charged with the misdemeanor conspiracy offense were
Blackwell's sister, Theresa Blackwell, 19, and Kipling Messer, 19.
   They have been released on a $2,000 bond each, Ms. McNair said.
   Conspiracy to commit extortion carries a maximum penalty of five
years in prison or up to a $5,000 fine.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even Morton Downey Jr. predicts his
confrontational nationally syndicated TV talk show is headed down
the tubes.
   ``It's my guess that it'll be all over in September,'' Downey
told the Daily News in today's editions. ``It's a very sad state of
affairs.''
   Downey said that so far the show has been sold in 22 markets, and
needs at least 60 to get renewed.
   Still, distributor MCA-TV insists it hasn't decided the show's
fate and is still actively selling it for next season, the News
reported.
   Whatever went wrong, ``it certainly wasn't from a lack of
publicity,'' said the man noted for enthusiastically berating
guests, including skinheads, feminists and homosexuals.
   Just two months ago Downey was in the headlines again when he
claimed a bunch of neo-Nazis attacked him in a San Francisco
bathroom, cut his hair and drew a swastika on his face. Critics
charged it was a publicity stunt.
   The Downey show first aired on the New Jersey-based WWOR-TV in
November 1987 and went into national syndication the following May.
At its peak it was shown on 72 stations. But recently several
stations have either dropped it or moved it into later time slots.
   ``I feel bad that this will mean the end of this type of talk
show,'' Downey said. ``No one will take a chance on it anymore.''
   Downey said he won't be caught unprepared if the show is
canceled. He told the News he's working on a summer special for one
of the networks, a Christmas album and night club revues for Las
Vegas and Atlantic City.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subway drivers today mounted their sixth 24-hour
strike in two months to back pay demands, creating travel chaos for
city commuters.
   Although more subways were running than during the previous
strikes, many commuters were forced to use cars, buses, trains and
their feet to get to work.
   Spokesman Roger Shire of London Underground, which runs the
subway system, called the strike ``sheer anarchy at the public's
expense.''
   Some bus drivers in south London also staged a wildcat walkout.
   The subway dispute centers on introduction of driver-only trains.
   Drivers want a $99 weekly increase for operating without a guard.
Management is offering $46 with extra vacation.
   In another labor dispute, the National Union of Railwaymen has
called a 24-hour strike by its 75,000 rail workers for Wednesday.
   It is protesting British Rail's refusal to increase its pay offer
above 7 percent.
   On the same day, the union's 10,500 members employed by London
Underground have been called out over management proposals to change
working and promotion rules.

   Reports from interior China have been rare since
troops cleared student demonstrators from Tiananmen Square in
Beijing on the night of June 3-4. Here is an account of events in
Chengdu from a correspondent who traveled to the city in central
China.

   When Beijing's night of blood and fire had
ended, witnesses said police with clubs attacked people gathered at
a huge statue of Mao in Chengdu, 1,000 miles away, starting riots
that spread through the city.
   Witnesses said a market was destroyed by flames and a row of
buses was burned during two days of street battles that began
Sunday, June 4.
   They said up to 30 people were killed, more than half of them
students. Official press reports have said 300 police were injured
but have not mentioned fatalities.
   It was one of the most violent episodes outside Beijing, where
soldiers swept into Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4 to end
weeks of student protests for democracy.
   The government says a few hundred people were killed in Beijing,
at least half of them soldiers, but Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence put the civilian death toll at about 3,000.
   As in the capital, students in Chengdu began protesting for
democracy in mid-April after the death of former Communist Party
chief Hu Yaobang, who lost his job for being too easy on student
protests two years earlier.
   Their focal point was the white 50-foot statue of Mao Tse-Tung,
father of communist China, in the heart of Chengdu, capital of
central Sichuan province.
   On that Sunday, police charged in with clubs, arresting 47
students and four workers the official media said were camping out
at the statue.
   Word of the assault spread and 10,000 people gathered at the
statue, witnesses said. Reports of the Beijing bloodshed also were
coming in by telephone and Voice of America radio.
   Protesters attacked police and were turned back with tear gas and
water cannons, the witnesses said.
   A student reported seeing at least one person killed with a
bayonet. Unconfirmed reports said several people were shot dead.
   ``Many students were beaten with clubs with enlarged ends that
leave no marks but scramble your brains,'' said a student at Sichuan
University, a center of the democracy movement.
   The Sichuan Daily and Chengdu Evening News have denied rumors
that two women were mutilated with bayonets.
   That night, protesters set fire to a police booth at the entrance
of the People's Market and the flames spread through the entire
half-block area. Several city buses also were burned.
   ``It was a mess,'' said a 20-year-old artist who watched the
market burn. ``There were fire trucks and ambulances everywhere.''
   There were no reports of injuries or deaths in the fire, which
the artist said started soon after midnight.
   The next day _ Monday, June 5 _ news of the carnage in Beijing
spread and more people went to the statue.
   Protesters burned more buses and police threw smoke bombs into
the crowd, witnesses said.
   At about 10 p.m., 100 people went on a rampage down People's
South Road toward the Jinjiang Hotel.
   ``They came by and smashed a stack of beer bottles we had
outside,'' said a bartender at the Flying Dragon Beer House.
``Fortunately, they left us alone otherwise.''
   The looters smashed windows of the Chengdu Department Store and
the Minshan Hotel, across the street from the Jinjiang, and
overturned a taxi into a pond, witnesses said. Scaling the locked
gates of the Jinjiang, about half a dozen stormed the front door.
   ``They had knives and steel pipes. They kept chasing us to the
back of the hotel,'' said a waiter at the Jinjiang's lobby bar.
``They stole beer and cigarettes. They scared the hell out of us.''
   When five truckloads of police arrived after half an hour, the
raiders scattered.
   ``None appeared to be students,'' a witness said. ``They were
factory workers, thugs and teen-agers, unrelated to the
pro-democracy movement or the people-police conflict.''
   That night, the People's Movie Theater across from the market was
burned down.
   Shopkeepers across the street from the market were reluctant to
talk with foreigners. Several said brusquely that they had closed
June 5 for several days, and therefore saw nothing.
   ``If you're reporters go talk to city officials,'' a restaurant
manager said. ``We're just minding our own business.''
   Official press reports said police arrested 100 ``hoodlums,'' but
there has been no mention of students other than a ban on their
activist union.
   Few students remain on campus because no classes are being held,
and some have fled in fear of government reprisals.
   ``The unrest is basically over,'' said a sophomore studying
chemistry at Sichuan University. ``I came back because I had to see
my professors and do some experiments.''
   ``I think the student movement is over, and it won't come back in
September,'' when classes are likely to resume, said a senior
majoring in English.
   More than 400 American citizens, including dependents of
consulate staff members, have left Sichuan and surrounding provinces
via Hong Kong, leaving about 80 in the region, U.S. officials say.
The consulate issued an advisory saying travel to Beijing should be
avoided.
   Truckloads of police cruise the streets and authorities are
putting pressure on foreign journalists in Chengdu, as well as in
Beijing and Shanghai.
   Police confiscated the passports of two correspondents of
Britain's Independent Television Network on Tuesday and had not
returned them by Thursday.

<TEXT>
   An earthquake struck an area 50 miles west
of Kodiak, Alaska, early today, but only minor damage was reported,
the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center said.
   The quake, which had a preliminary reading of 5.9 on the Richter
scale, occurred at 2:51 a.m. ADT (6:51 a.m. EDT) and was felt in
Kodiak, Larsen Bay, Karluk and Akiok, said Alec Medberry, a
spokesman for the center. He said there was no danger of a tsunami,
or tidal wave.
   A dispatcher with the Alaska State Troopers in Kodiak said there
were reports from throughout Kodiak Island of pictures being knocked
off walls, but that no major damage was reported.
   Medberry said there were reports that some people were knocked
out of bed in Larsen Bay and that dishes were broken and lightbulbs
were broken in their sockets.
   Larsen Bay is a village on the west side of Kodiak Island. It is
about 375 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   If it hits a heavily populated area an earthquake of 3.5 on the
Richter scale can cause slight damage, 4 can cause moderate damage,
5 considerable damage, and 6 severe damage.

<HEAD>Navajo Chairman Arraigned on Tribal Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navajo chairman has pleaded
innocent to tribal charges accusing him of violating court orders
that barred him from acting as chairman after he was suspended by
the Tribal Council.
   Peter MacDonald, facing seven counts of interfering with judicial
process, was released on his own recognizance after he appeared
Thursday before Window Rock District Judge Robert Yazzie, officials
said.
   A July 7 pretrial conference was scheduled, said Duane Beyal,
spokesman for interim Chairman Leonard Haskie.
   A Tribal Council majority placed MacDonald on administrative
leave with pay Feb. 17 after U.S. Senate hearing testimony indicated
MacDonald accepted kickbacks and gifts from parties doing business
with the tribe.
   Beyal said the charges, filed by tribal Prosecutor Melvin Tso
Scott, accuse MacDonald of failing to comply with court orders
stemming from the council's decision.
   MacDonald has denied any wrongdoing and contends the council
action was illegal under tribal law. However, tribal courts have
upheld the council's placement of MacDonald and Vice Chairman Johnny
R. Thompson on leave and its appointment of Haskie as interim
chairman.
   MacDonald specifically is accused of violating a temporary
restraining order and a preliminary injunction issued by Yazzie. The
orders prohibited MacDonald and other tribal officials from entering
tribal offices and carrying out their offices' duties. Yazzie also
restrained MacDonald from using tribal airplanes and resources.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix has been conducting a grand
jury investigation of tribal finances under MacDonald's
chairmanship, but assistant U.S. attorney Allen Stooks said the
office was not involved in the tribal proceedings. Stooks declined
to discuss the grand jury investigation.

Disputes</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By TODD RICHISSIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's Roman Catholic bishops are
aiming to tackle a number of lingering controversies, including what
their stand should be on AIDS education and how to settle disputes
with religion teachers.
   About 300 cardinals, archbishops and bishops gathered today at
Seton Hall in South Orange for the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, opening the conference with a morning Mass. The meeting
ends Monday.
   Tension has increased over the last few years between the bishops
and religion teachers, some of whom have been disciplined for
advocating birth control and female priests, and taking other stands
that contradict church teachings.
   ``The doctrinal statement hopes to resolve these types of things
without doing too much damage,'' said Bob Wonderly, spokesman for
the bishops conference. ``In recent years there has seemingly been
an increase in these types of cases, at least in perception.''
   The dispute itself indicates a shift within the church.
   During a conference in 1968, the bishops specified the right of
priests and laymen to disagree with the church in the classroom. But
that right has since been questioned and theologians have been
punished for doing so.
   The policy to be considered this weekend would not solve disputes
over specific issues, but would establish procedure for settling
such arguments.
   In a widely publicized case, the Rev. Charles Curran was barred
from teaching theology at the Catholic University of America in
Washington. The university's action came after the Vatican strongly
criticized him for his positions on abortion, homosexuality and
other matters of sexual ethics.
   Disputes within the church have not been confined to the bishops
and theologians. The bishops themselves were divided over a
statement on AIDS issued by the group's 50-member administrative
board in December 1987.
   The AIDS statement insists on the church's teaching that the only
sure safeguards against contracting the disease are abstinence from
sex before marriage and fidelity within a marriage.
   But one paragraph said public education programs, directed at
people who may reject church standards, could include information
about condoms, which most medical experts say can help prevent the
disease.
   Critics charged this paragraph implied approval of condoms, which
the church has condemned as a form of birth control. Defenders
insist the document did not approve condoms, but said that they were
an alternative to halting the spread of the deadly disease.
   The bishops plan to issue a new report on the topic Saturday.
   The bishops also are scheduled to vote on a statement calling for
a normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam,
said Michael Hurley, spokesman for the Newark Archdiocese.

<HEAD>Radical Students Calling For Roh's Fall Battle Riot Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students calling
for the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo battled riot police with
firebombs, rocks and clubs today in campus protests in four cities,
police said.
   Fighting involving 5,000 students occurred at five campuses in
Seoul, Kwangju, Taejon and Chonju after riot police blocked students
from marching into the streets, police officials said. Protesters
surged out of the campuses to attack police with hundreds of
firebombs.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Down with dictatorship!''
protesters yelled.
   Police officials said there were numerous minor injuries, but
they had no reports of arrests.
   Student leaders called for the overthrow of Roh and demanded to
be allowed to take part in a youth festival next month in communist
North Korea. South Korea's government has refused to allow the
students to take part in the 13th World Youth Festival in Pyongyang,
the capital of North Korea, on July 1-8.
   ``March to Pyongyang!'' students chanted as they beat drums and
waved flags.
   Peaceful anti-government protests were also held today at many
colleges in Seoul and other cities, but police said they had no
figures on how many.
   The fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashes
in Seoul and other cities and indicated radical students had
abandoned a self-imposed ban on firebombs. Some student groups said
they would stop using the weapons after seven riot police were
killed in a May 3 campus clash, but other groups continued to use
firebombs.
   The students and allied dissident groups have little public
support because of their extremist views and violent tactics.
   Student leaders who refused to be identified said they had been
forced to use firebombs as self-defense against police attacks. But
the fighting today all appeared to have been started by students
when police blocked the marches.
   About 2,000 students from at least six colleges battled hundreds
of police at Hankuk University in Seoul. Riot police surrounding the
school hurled rocks at the protesters but did not use tear gas.
   Students marched out of the school and attacked riot police
blocking the road with wooden clubs and iron bars. Protesters then
attacked with firebombs, and several officers were set ablaze. The
fires were put out quickly by other troopers.
   Protesters knocked down parts of the school's wall to make
ammunition to hurl at police. Police set up iron barricades in the
streets to hold students back during the fighting, which lasted more
than an hour.
   Also today, opposition leader Kim Dae-jung demanded that the
United States apologize for its alleged role in a 1980 pro-democracy
civil uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left about 200
people dead. Kim is head of the largest opposition group, the Party
for Peace and Democracy.
   Kim likened recent incidents in China to the 1980 civil uprising
in Kwangju, the capital city of his home province, South Cholla.
   One day after Kim and many opposition figures were arrested by
martial law authorities on May 17, 1980, student-led demonstrators
in Kwangju rose up against the government, drove out police and
seized control of the city. Tank-led army troops ended the revolt in
nine days.
   Kim and many government critics believe the United States
acquiesced in the military suppression of the Kwangju revolt. They
say a South Korean army division under operational control of the
top U.S. army commander in Seoul was used to crush the Kwangju
uprising.
   The United States had denied the allegations.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun today
threatened to attack roads to Syria's capital after Syrian shells
hit a tanker carrying gasoline to the Christian area. A sailor was
missing and presumed dead.
   ``Roads leading to capitals of occupation (forces) will not be
safe henceforth,'' the army commander said in a statement broadcast
by the state-run radio.
   ``We shall confront this foreign enemy with the courage of a
warrior at the front,'' Aoun said.
   The roads between Damascus, the capital of Syria, and Lebanon are
vital to Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon, stationed there under a
1976 peacekeeping mandate. Attacking the highways would mark a sharp
escalation in the 3-month-old confrontation between Aoun's mainly
Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian and Druse Moslem
militiamen.
   Aoun did not spell out how he would strike. His artillery has
shelled the network of roads, mainly in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley of east Lebanon, but he could also use hit-and-run commando
raids, land mines or car bombs on the highways.
   Syrian shells hit the oil tanker late Thursday, and the ship
burned out of control through the night. Firefighters brought the
blaze under control today, but the 660,000 gallons of badly needed
gasoline were lost.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, identified the vessel as the Timex Star.
   But Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Unit in London, which monitors
shipping around the world, said its agents in Beirut identified the
ship as the 1,507-ton tanker Chemicoral, owned by the Chemicoral Co.
of Piraeus, Greece.
   Officials rescued nine Indian and four Lebanese sailors who
abandoned the burning vessel, but an Indian crewman was missing and
presumed dead, said the police spokesman.
   The Christian enclave suffers from an acute shortage of fuel
because the main depots in the east Beirut neighborhood of Dora were
devastated by Syrian shellfire March 30.
   The ship was hit about 500 yards off Tabarja, a tiny port 15
miles north of Beirut.
   Syrian gunners shelled the Christian coastline again today, but
no casualties were reported.
   Syrian and Moslem militia forces have been battling Aoun's forces
in the latest round of Lebanon's civil war.
   The outbreak in fighting, which began March 8, has killed 372
people and wounded 1,450 wounded.

   Seven employees at an Immigration and
Naturalization Service detention center were among those indicted on
federal drug charges after a six-month undercover investigation,
authorities said.
   The sealed indictments were returned Tuesday and were ordered
unsealed Thursday after all but one had been arrested.
   The indictments allege that cocaine and marijuana were sold to an
undercover agent, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crews said.
   ``The amounts of drugs are relatively small,'' he said. ``What
makes it exceptionally significant, to us, however, is that the
offenses are alleged to have occurred either at the service
processing center or by individuals employed by the United States.
And it's the position of this office that any amount is too much
when it comes to that.''
   Crews said no detainees were involved in the alleged offenses.
   In all, nine people were named in the indictments, officials
said. Seven had worked either for the INS or a private security
company at the Port Isabel Service Processing Center, where
undocumented aliens are detained before deportation, authorities
said.
   The center has a detainee population of about 1,300.
   Eight suspects appeared Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Fidencio
Garza and each was released on a $10,000 unsecured bond. Garza
scheduled arraignments for Wednesday.
   The two employees still working for the INS have been suspended
until the matter is resolved, said INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice.
She said the INS initiated the investigation after becoming
suspicious of activity at the detention center.
   Officials said no more indictments are expected in the case,
which stemmed from a six-month undercover investigation by the
Justice Department's Office of Inspector General.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Chinese Demonstrators Not Like Anti-Vietnam War Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan said today
Chinese demonstrators should not be likened to anti-Vietnam war
protesters because the Chinese students are ``trying to get rid of''
the type of government American students wanted to bring to power.
   Reagan, who was governor of California during anti-war protests,
said the American Communist Party played a major role in ``those
student uprisings'' against the U.S. role in Vietnam.
   The former president was interviewed from Paris on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America.''
   Asked why he spoke favorably of the Chinese students but had
frowned on the anti-war demonstrations in the United States during
the 1960s, Reagan said:
   ``The difference was, if you really look at what they were trying
to change, they were trying to bring about...the things that the
young people in China are now trying to get rid of,'' Reagan said.
   As governor, Reagan said he had access to police and other
intelligence unavailable to the public.
   ``We knew the role that the American Communist Party was playing
in those student uprisings,'' Reagan said. He said members of the
party were involved in both pro-war and anti-war demonstrations ``in
order to keep the disturbances going, to make sure that the trouble
continued.''
   As for the Chinese demonstrators, Reagan said the students might
have pushed their goals too fast but he believed they had widespread
support, especially among their parents and families. During an
ongoing crackdown against the students, the Chinese government has
characterized them as counter-revolutionaries with little popular
support.
   ``You have to believe that those families sided with them,''
Reagan said. ``So they didn't change any of those people's _ the
Chinese people's _ minds about the need for more freedom and more
democracy in their system.''

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, euphoric over
the recent visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, predicted
today there will be an East-West accord on reducing conventional
forces in Europe within a year.
   In a parliamentary address recapping the Gorbachev visit, Kohl
also sharpened his denunciation of the crackdown by Chinese
officials on pro-democracy demonstrators, calling it a ``relapse
into unmasked suppression.''
   Kohl and his main political opponents were united in their
celebration of Gorbachev's four-day visit.
   Kohl said Gorbachev's visit was a ``huge and important success''
that would ``widen the trust between the two nations and
governments.''
   The chancellor also said he and Gorbachev ``were in agreement
that the Vienna negotiations on (reducing) conventional weapons must
be carried out with all energy. We decided to remain in close
personal contact over this matter.''
   Kohl said he and Gorbachev agreed it is possible to forge an
initial agreement on reducing conventional forces within six to 12
months and for its terms to be carried out through 1992 and 1993.
   At a NATO summit in Brussels last month, President Bush announced
a major disarmament initiative aimed at producing a conventional
forces agreement at the East-West negotiations in Vienna within a
year.
   In his wide-ranging parliamentary speech, Kohl again criticized
the killing of Chinese students by troops in Beijing and the arrests
resulting from the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   ``The peaceful protest by thousands of students and workers was
strangled by tanks. And now a decreed wave of denunciations and
planned arrests has begun,'' Kohl said.
   ``We mourn for the victims with all Chinese in the world and
denounce with all friends of China this relapse into unmasked
suppression,'' Kohl said.
   Gorbachev returned to the Soviet Union on Thursday after
receiving an enthusiastic welcome on every stop of his West German
visit.
   Gorbachev is the most popular foreign leader among West Germans,
who view him as the most important element in a new atmosphere of
peace and trust in East-West relations.
   Even West Germany's opposition Social Democrats, normally at odds
with Kohl, congratulated the chancellor for his talks with Gorbachev.
   A veteran member of the opposition Social Democrats, former
Chancellor Willy Brandt, said Gorbachev's trip was ``a success for
the federal government, which we applaud.''
   Brandt also reminded Parliament that as chancellor he was the
architect of the first postwar thaw between West Germany and the
Soviet-led East bloc, which earned him the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize.
   West German relations with the Soviets slid again in the early
1980s following Bonn's decision to permit the deployment of new NATO
missiles.

both subsidies and tax credits for child care will end the ``tragic
choice'' parents face between leaving a child alone while working or
accepting welfare, a Democratic senator said today.
   Sen. Alan Cranston of California opened the second day of debate
on the measure, calling it a ``very fine, very important step toward
providing care for children who need it.''
   And, Cranston said, the assistance provided in the legislation
would eliminate ``the tragic choice many parents face where they
either have to be at work and leave their child unattended or stay
with their child and be on welfare. We obviously should end that
tragic situation.''
   Under an agreement between Democrats and Republicans, no votes on
proposed amendments will be held before Monday. The proposal faces
stiff opposition from the White House, which favors an approach
dependent almost solely on tax credits. Democrats say they are open
to compromise but committed to the principles of the Act for Better
Child Care sponsored by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   Dodd agreed to a number of changes in his plan in order to get it
to the Senate floor Thursday, a significant step in itself given the
staunch opposition the package faced earlier this year.
   Opposition stemmed for the most part from two provisions in the
original bill, one calling for federal regulation of child care and
another that many lawmakers believed would have forced the closing
of church-run centers.
   The revised version leaves regulations to the states, although it
would establish federal guidelines for the states to follow if they
wished. And it allows for vouchers to be used to pay for child care
at church-run centers provided the money is not used ``in a manner
inconsistent with the Constitution,'' which mandates separation of
church and state.
   Those changes were drafted with the assistance of a leading GOP
senator, Orrin Hatch of Utah, who challenged the administration's
position that tax credits alone would put a significant dent in the
nation's child care problems.
   ``It will not, by itself, encourage family based providers,
churches, non-profit organizations or businesses to offer child care
services,'' Hatch said. ``There are other factors that discourage
choice in child care which cannot be addressed simply by giving more
money to consumers.''
   Also tacked on to the bill was a tax credit package passed by the
Senate Finance Committee. It would make the existing dependent care
tax credit refundable in advance and also establish a new credit
that would give back up to $500 to help families with annual incomes
of less than $21,000 pay for their children's health insurance.
   Also included in the measure is an amendment unrelated to child
care that would delay the implementation of a law requiring business
to test their benefit programs for discrimination between lower and
higher paid employees. Business interests have been lobbying heavily
for the extension and by attaching it to the child care package
Democrats hope to increase support among Republicans.
   But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., made it clear the
GOP would press its plan, shaped largely by the child care tax
credit promised by President Bush during the campaign.
   ``This is a necessity,'' Dole said. ``It is a high priority with
the president. It is a high priority with the administration. But we
believe there is a better way to go.''
   Seventy-percent of the money $1.75 billion proposed to be spent
on the Dodd bill would go to parents to help pay for child care, 22
percent would go to training and grant and loan programs designed to
improve the quality and supply of child care and 8 percent would go
to states to administer programs and enforce standards.
   The tax-credit portion of the measure would cost the government
$10.3 billion over five years but includes proposal to offset the
loss, including making permanent a 3 percent federal telephone tax
scheduled to drop to 2 percent next year.

   A fire that was supposed to be a controlled
blaze to clear brush leaped fire lines, charring at least 400 acres
and injuring at least three people before being contained early
today, forest officials said.
   The fire in Bautista Canyon 10 miles southeast of Hemet was
ignited Thursday afternoon in heavy brush known as chaparral and had
blackened 400 acres by early today, said Tom Sintaffar, a dispatcher
for the San Bernardino National Forest.
   About 500 firefighters were battling the blaze and had it
contained by 6 a.m. They expected to have it extinguished by
Saturday, Sintaffar said.
   San Bernardino National Forest officials intentionally set the
fire to clear bursh, but it escaped their control, said Forest
Service spokeswoman Lindsay Maierhofer.
   ``This happens very rarely, because prescribed burns are
conducted under very controlled conditions. Apparently they got some
unexpected winds,'' she said.
   Winds had calmed overnight, but firefighters were anticipating
dry, hot temperatures and the possibility of the wind kicking up
later in the day, Sintaffar said.
   Two firefighter suffered minor injuries and a California
Department of Corrections prison inmate fighting the fire broke a
leg in a fall, said Sintaffar and Maierhofer.
   Sintaffar said no structures were in danger early today, although
reports Thursday indicated there had been some threat to scattered
small homes and a U.S. Forest Service training facility and station.

   Storms that dumped nearly 2 inches of
rain forced authorities to close several highways and evacuate homes
flooded by muddy creek water in a town that remained cut off from
the rest of the state this morning.
   At least 50 families in Dunlow in southwest West Virginia were
evacuated to churches and the fire station, which is on a hill, fire
officials said. But by midmorning the floodwaters were already
retreating and officials were optimistic the evacuations would not
last long.
   ``We've taken them out in boats and four-wheel-drive vehicles.
Rescue people have waded through water over their chests to haul
many elderly out of their homes,'' said fire Capt. Reva Sanders.
   The Red Cross could not reach the community of about 350 people
because ``there's water on both ends and all the way around,'' Fire
Chief Tom Beckett said. He said officials were unable to assess
damage immediately.
   ``The waters fell about a foot and a half since 5:30 a.m.,'' the
fire chief said shortly after 7:30 a.m. ``It came fast and it's
going down fast. ... We should be able to get back in there by 4 or
5 this evening.''
   Peter Parke, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said heavy
rains fell across several counties east, northeast and west of
Charleston, with westernmost Wayne County, which includes Dunlow,
having the worst flooding.
   At Radnor in southern Wayne County, ``they feared the crest of
water was going to destroy much of that town,'' Parke said.
   He said high waters closed parts of U.S. 119, W.Va. 214 and W.Va.
94 in Kanawha County, which encompasses Charleston.
   As the rain let up and waters receded today, Kanawha County
Sheriff Art Ashley said deputies found property damage limited there.
   ``I don't think there's any need to evacuate. It's more of an
inconvenience than a catastrophe,'' he said.
   The weather service said the heaviest rains fell from 3 to 8 p.m.
Thursday. Charleston received 1.83 inches in a 24-hour period.

   Businesses shut down as thousands of
blacks stayed away from work today to observe a self-declared
national holiday on the 13th anniversary of the Soweto township
riots.
   Police reported sporadic violence in several areas.
   A group of blacks apparently attempting to enforce the work
stoppage fatally stabbed a black motorist in Guguletu, a township
outside Cape Town, police said.
   Police used tear gas to disperse 3,000 people who attended a
rally at the Regina Mundi Roman Catholic Church in Soweto, the huge
township outside Johannesburg. Police also fired tear gas to break
up a church service outside Durban, witnesses said.
   Vandals during the night smashed the tombstone of Hector
Pieterson, a 13-year-old boy who was the first person killed in 1976
when police fired at students protesting the requirement that they
be taught in Afrikaans, the language of the white Afrikaners who
dominate the government.
   Friends said the smashed grave marker at Avalon Cemetery in
Soweto was discovered when Pieterson's mother arrived to place
flowers on the grave today.
   Commonly known as ``Soweto Day,'' June 16 has no official status
as a holiday. But many businesses closed because so many black
workers and customers take the day off. Hundreds of employers have
negotiated contracts with workers to make it a paid holiday, while
others have adopted a ``no work, no pay, no disciplinary action''
policy on June 16.
   ``The anniversary must be used not as a weapon in a war of
bitterness, but as a repeated catalyst for constructive change,''
The Star, the country's largest daily, said in an editorial.
   ``Freedom for all remains an unattainable goal unless the
government is willing to break away from the basic concepts of
apartheid,'' it added.
   In the major cities of Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, black
commuter traffic was less than half the weekday average, according
to various estimates. Bus stops, railway stations, and taxi stands
were unusually empty. Black schools nationwide were deserted.
   Buses in Durban traveled under police escort to prevent attacks
by black militants attempting to enforce the work stoppage.
   The 1976 Soweto riots spread nationwide and an estimated 700
blacks were killed in the ensuing months, a period that brought a
new level of militancy to the anti-apartheid movement.
   Thousands of blacks fled the country at that time to join the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement, the main
black group attempting to undermine the white-led government.
   The country's largest black-oriented daily newspaper, The
Sowetan, said Thursday in an editorial: ``Thirteen years ago we went
through a bloodbath over the country's education system _ to this
day very little has changed.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites exercise
political and economic control over 28 million blacks. Whites
maintain segregated schools, neighborhoods and hospitals.

   The governor of this British colony today
criticized countries that oppose forcibly repatriating some
Vietnamese boat people, saying they are acting illogically and
inhumanely.
   The governor, David Wilson, spoke with reporters after returning
from an international conference on boat people in Geneva. There,
the United States, the Soviet Union and Vietnam opposed calls for
forced repatriation of boat people who are not considered refugees.
   Britain and Hong Kong support the repatriation.
   Hong Kong is swamped with about 30,000 boat people. The
government says many are not refugees fleeing political persecution
but illegal immigrants seeking better economic conditions.
   Wilson said there are many countries that ``simply will not face
facts.'' He said such countries agree there's no question of
resettling in third countries people who are not refugees, but at
the same time they oppose forcing such people back to Vietnam.
   ``To my mind that is illogical, and indeed I think it is inhumane
because what it is saying is that those people should simply pile up
in camps around the region,'' Wilson said.
   The head of the relief agency Oxfam Hong Kong, Chris Bale, said
today there is no alternative to forced repatriation because the
Vietnamese ``really do not want to go back.''
   Those who are not refugees should be returned just as illegal
immigrants from any other country are returned, he said. He said
many Vietnamese were suffering psychological problems from being
confined in the camps for years.
   Starting in June 1988, Hong Kong tried to curb the influx by a
screening the Vietnamese and separating refugees, who are eligible
for resettlement in the West, from other groups who are supposed to
return home. Only 143 Vietnamese have gone back voluntarily even
though the United Nations gives financial aid for people to return.
   The 60-nation conference in Geneva adopted a plan introducing
universal screening programs. The plan called for encouraging
voluntary return and said if this did not succeed, alternatives
would be examined.
   Local police in Tokyo today said 105 people found on a wooden
boat near a southwestern Japanese island were all Vietnamese who
left home in search of a place where they could ``enjoy a higher
standard of living.''
   The police official, who requested anonymity, said a local
Vietnamese woman confirmed the Vietnamese came from Hon Gai, a small
village along the Gulf of Tonkin, near the boarder of Vietnam and
China.
   A local fisherman spotted the old wooden boat near Hazama Port,
610 miles southwest of Tokyo, early today.
   If the Immigration Office grants the group refugee status, they
will be allowed a 180-day stay in Japan until their final
destination is determined. That stay can be extended until a
permanent residence is found through the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees in Tokyo.

   President Bush said today his crime crackdown
policies may not be popular with some judges because they fill trial
calendars, but he declared they are needed to stop the ``shooting
war'' in the streets.
   Bush told a White House gathering of about 90 of the nation's 94
U.S. attorneys to return to their states and enforce his policy of
no plea bargaining with violent, gun-wielding offenders.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh gave the prosecutors a set of
written guidelines regarding plea bargaining for crimes involving
firearms.
   Thornburgh wrote: ``In all but exceptional cases such as those in
which the defendant has provided subastantial assistance to the
government in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others,
federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involving
the unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable.
   Bush told the federal prosecutors they are ``the commanders at
the frontlines'' and urged them to help ``put away the nation's most
wanted.''
   ``The situation in our streets has been aptly compared to a
shooting war,'' he said, noting that many in the room might take
issue with statements that the country is at peace.
   The president hammered home his view that criminals who use guns
in violent crimes should be prosecuted to the maximum extent.
   ``This policy may mean more trials. ... firearms cases like
narcotics cases, are not always very popular with some on the
bench,'' he acknowledged. ``But it can be done, and in fact already
is being done, even in districts with these overcrowded dockets
....''
   Bush said his proposals for more federal prosecutors,
law-enforcement officers and new prison construction will help ease
the overburdened criminal justice system.
   Bush also emphasized the need cracking down on white collar
crime, calling for strict enforcement of laws against financial and
banking fraud, organized crime and civil rights violations.
   ``Crime is crime whether committed with a briefcase or a gun. We
will not tolerate greed over honest business,'' he said.
   Bush on Thursday sent Congress the legislative draft of the $1.2
billion anti-crime package which he outlined a moth ago.
   But to dramatize his commitment to fighting drugs and violent
crime, Bush journeyed to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center
in steamy Glynco, Ga., to sign the transmittal document.
   Most of the money _ $1 billion _ would go to expand federal
prison capacity, but Bush also is intent on hiring 1,600 new
prosecutors to work under the U.S. attorneys, and 825 new federal
agents.
   The U.S. Treasury-run center in Georgia trains police and
investigators from every federal law enforcement agency except the
FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
   ``In a country where criminals threaten to erode the very
liberties we hold so dear, you are domestic freedom fighters in the
war on crime,'' Bush told trainees and several thousand others
gathered on a 90-degree day for the event.
   Bush said he has instructed Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who
accompanied him to Georgia, ``to advise America's federal
prosecutors to end plea bargaining for violent federal firearms
offenses.
   ``Our message to the common criminal is this: Pack a gun and
we'll pack you away,'' he said.
   He exhorted Congress to enact his plan to double the mandatory
penalty for use of semi-automatic weapons in drug or violent crimes
to 10 years.
   But earlier, Bush advised a graduating Border Patrol officer,
David Rivera, to remember that criminal suspects ``should be treated
with respect and given his rights or her rights, even though the
evidence looks overwhelming.''

   Republicans today commended GOP National
Chairman Lee Atwater for his aggressive leadership and said he had
been subjected to ``unremitting attacks'' from Democrats.
   Atwater repeated his call for the election of a Cuban-American to
succeed the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., a stance termed
inflammatory by a Democratic state senator.
   Members of the Republican National Committee adopted a resolution
commending Atwater's leadership and saying it had made him ``the
target of unremitting attacks from Democrats and their surrogates.''
   In debate on the resolution, Jack London, the GOP national
committeeman from Arizona, praised what he called Atwater's courage
and asked, ``Why do you think the Democrats want to get rid of him?''
   Atwater pledged that ``every ounce of energy I have is going to
be dedicated to doing the best job I can to promote this party.''
   Atwater said at a meeting of the Cuban-American National
Foundation in Washington on Tuesday that he gave priority to the
election of a Cuban-American to Pepper's seat.
   ``I'm saying it again because I believe it,'' Atwater told the
GOP committee today. ``I believe there is a place in the U.S.
Congress for a Cuban-American and if the Democrats don't like that,
fine ... they can keep attacking me and keep attacking me and keep
attacking me.''
   On Thursday, a Democratic state senator, Jack Gordon, withdrew
from the race to succeed Pepper and attacked Atwater's call for the
election of a Cuban-American.
   ``No statement would more inflame a city that has more tension
and antagonism than it can possibly deal with right now,'' Gordon
said, calling Atwater's statement ``outrageous'' and
``irresponsible.''
   Atwater, however, said, ``I think it would be great if we could
elect a Cuban-American to Congress, and this party is dedicated to
doing that.''
   Atwater made no mention of the controversial memo sent out from
the RNC office earlier this month attacking the voting record of
Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley. The resolution commending him
also made no direct mention of the memo.
   Most committee members and state GOP chairmen interviewed as they
opened the two-day meeting predicted Atwater would ride out the
controversy generated by the memo comparing the new House speaker's
voting record to that of Rep. Barney Frank.
   Critics of the memo say it was unfair because it was headed ``Tom
Foley: Out of the Liberal Closet'' and Frank, a Massachusetts
Democrat, is an acknowledged homosexual.
   An Atwater aide, Mark Goodin, resigned after saying he had
approved the memo. Democrats have called on President Bush to fire
Atwater, but the president has said he accepts the chairman's
statement that the memo was written and mailed without his knowledge.
   Donald Devine, chairman of the conservative political action
group Citizens for America, told reporters at Thursday's session,
``I would say he (Atwater) is home safe.''
   ``He may take a low profile but his real talent is organizing and
setting plans, and for that he doesn't need to be on the front
page,'' Devine said. ``I would be personally upset if he did not
stay on as chairman.''
   Michigan State Republican Chairman E. Spencer Abraham said he did
not believe the distribution of the memo would cause continuing
problems for Atwater.
   ``I think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and I think the
proper actions were taken and Mark Goodin resigned and that's the
end of it,'' the Michigan chairman said.
   However, Richard M. Rosenbaum, the national committeeman from New
York, said, ``I find what happened to be very embarrassing and
regrettable.'' Asked if the incident would be crippling to Atwater,
Rosenbaum said: ``I don't know. It's still a little early to get a
real consensus.''
   Jennifer Dunn, the Republican chairwoman in Foley's home state of
Washington, said she had received ``very few calls'' about the memo.
   ``It was a very unfortunate thing, but I think it turned into a
media issue and a Democratic issue,'' Ms. Dunn said.

   A private escrow agent nicknamed ``Robin HUD''
told Congress today she considers her diversion of millions of
dollars from government housing programs ``sin'' and intends to
repay the money.
   And the inspector general at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development said accountability problems in the agency that
permitted such schemes still exist.
   ``I, in no way, justify what I have done as being anything less
than sin,'' Marilyn Harrell told the House subcommittee on housing
and employment, adding that she expected ``no leniency or immunity
from prosecution.''
   ``Allow me to state, for the record, that I do _ regardless of
where my life takes me from here _ intend to repay in full all
monies taken,'' she said.
   Harrell, who has admitted to investigators that she did not
forward at least $5.5 million to the federal housing agency,
repeated claims that she donated much of the money to charitable
projects to provide housing for the poor.
   ``What was spent over and above what we needed to run the company
was directed legitimately to help the poor and homeless and assist
those ministries that did the same,'' she said.
   ``HUD has not established effective monitoring systems to assure
that closing agents properly carry out their responsibilities,''
said Paul Adams, inspector general at the department.
   ``Moreover, planned changes to its automated systems have been
slow, and current systems do not contain all information field
offices need to properly monitor agent activities,'' he added.
   ``I would be surprised if this would be the end of the
revelations,'' said subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   Last week four senior HUD employees in the Washington, D.C.,
field office were placed on administrative leave after HUD
investigators found escrow agents may have embezzled as much as $10
million through the program without being noticed.
   Washington authorities also want to question Earl Martin, an
attorney who has been missing for about a year about the
disappearance of another $3 million.
   Another agent has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Fort
Worth, Texas, on charges of stealing $2.5 million from the sales of
55 homes in the Dallas area.
   ``It appears that HUD monitored these settlement agents with the
same vigilance Exxon used in watching over the skippers of its
tankers,'' said Lantos, comparing former HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce's tenure at the agency to the recent Alaska oil spill.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp reportedly has ordered all 53 field
offices to conduct reviews and give an accounting for all proceeds
from the sales of the agency's property.
   On Thursday, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also ordered
federal prosecutors to examine the property-sales programs for
evidence of criminal fraud and embezzlement.
   HUD already is reeling from allegations of mismanagement,
favoritism and influence-peddling in the administration of a
rehabilitation program to renovate housing for the nation's poor.
   Lantos decided to proceed with hearings on the property-sales
program despite Adams' objections they might endanger the agency's
probe.
   ``I rarely find that it jeopardizes an investigation,
particularly if you're not granting use immunity,'' said
subcommittee member Christopher Shays, R-Conn.
   ``The more we investigate the more we uncover. It just doesn't
seem to end.''

   Editorials in China's official media in the past
few days indicate the leadership wants to turn the public against
people the authorities have branded counterrevolutionaries.
   ``A gang of political hoodlums, the evil remnants of the Gang of
Four and other dregs of society,'' is how the People's Daily
described students and supporters, now condemned for seeking greater
political freedoms.
   The Gang of Four were the radical leaders of the 1966-76 violent
far-left Cultural Revolution.
   One of the four, Yao Wenyuan, was a former journalist who became
known for the kind of vitriolic editorials that have appeared three
straight days on the front page of the People's Daily, the Communist
Party paper.
   Some Chinese said privately that the recent string of editorials
were not up to the standard of Yao and other Cultural Revolution
propagandists, who condemned so-called class enemies with a wide
range of epithets including ``cow demon and snake spirit.''
   But today's editorial called the protesters an ``ideological
pimple'' and said the words of senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who
ordered the crackdown, were ``the most powerful ideological weapon
for lancing (it).''
   Biting language also was used to condemn two American reporters
who were ordered out of the country. The Economic Daily called John
Pomfret of The Associated Press and Alan Pessin of the Voice of
America ``gods of plague'' who took advantage of and stirred up
``naive, pure and innocent'' students.
   ``They spread the plague to Tiananmen Square, to all of China and
the whole world. It is time to sterilize it,'' the paper said.
   The name-calling reflected traditional emphasis on names and
labels, but also an urgent drive to convince anyone still in doubt
about the correctness of the crackdown. Several editorials played on
fears of a return to past turmoil.
   ``If (the protesters') plot had succeeded, greater turmoil and
division would have occurred nationwide and the people's republic
that was paid for with the lives of countless martyrs would have
been destroyed in a single day,'' the People's Daily fumed Thursday,
``and the whole nation would have been enveloped in a `white
terror.'''
   ``White terror'' was a reference to Nationalist executions and
imprisonments of communist underground workers during the civil war
in the 1930's and '40s.
   ``If we show weakness or turn backward in the face of capitalist
attack ... the achievements of 40 years of socialism would be wiped
out in a single day and China would once again become a dependency
of imperialism,'' said today's editorial.
   ``Some comrades haven't opened up their minds and are still
confused about certain issues,'' it said. ``Abroad there is
anti-Chinese and anti-Communist clamor, and in China there is a
market for every kind of rumor.''
   For these comrades, Beijing television continued its expanded
nightly news report, double the usual 15 minutes, while the usual
30-minute national news ran more than an hour. Most of the
television reports have shown arrests of protesters, visits by top
officials to soldiers enforcing martial law, and workers gathered to
study Deng's recent speech applauding the crackdown.
   In one report, a group of workers in hardhats clapped hands and
sang the children's song, ``Without the Communist Party, there would
be no new China.''
   Most newspapers have been published with only four pages instead
of their usual eight for the past week because of a shortage of
newsprint caused by martial law-related disruptions in
transportation. But almost all the space has been taken up by
stories related to the crackdown.

   An explosion Friday at a gas station
injured 15 people and started a fire that destroyed more than 45
cars in a parking garage, police said.
   Station owner Dimitris Asvestas ran from the station engulfed in
flames after the blast, a witness said, and he was listed in
critical condition at a hospital with third-degree burns. Flying
debris injured 14 others, two of them seriously.
   The blast ignited a fire that swept through a parking garage
beneath a seven-story office building, destroying the cars, police
said. The cars' exploding gas tanks kept firefighters from entering
the garage for more than an hour.
   Police said they don't know what caused the explosion.

<HEAD>Court Says MCI Forfeited Opportunity to Have Contract Reopened</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has ruled that MCI
forfeited its opportunity to have a multibillion-dollar federal
telecommunications contract reopened because it failed to bid the
first time.
   ``MCI did not act on time to become an interested party with
regard to the solicitation,'' the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit said Thursday. ``MCI's argument that it is an
interested party must be rejected.''
   Last December 7, the General Services Administration awarded the
contract for one network to AT&amp;T and for the other to US Sprint.
Losing out was a third bidder, Martin Marietta Corporation, whose
proposal included a substantial share for MCI.
   The contracts for the two networks are among the largest
non-military awards by the U.S. Government. They are valued at
between $3 billion and $10 billion, and they could reach a maximum
$25 billion over their 10-year life.
   MCI went before the GSA Board of Contract Appeals to challenge
the award to AT&amp;T, complaining that GSA, after awarding the
contract, impermissibly waived requirements instead of resoliciting
the contract.
   The board rejected the claim in February, saying that MCI _ which
was to have been a major subcontractor for Martin Marietta _ was not
an interested party. MCI had claimed that if the contract were
resolicited it would be a ``prospective bidder'' but the board
rejected that also.
   MCI carried the case to the appeals court.
   That court agreed with the government that the laws involved do
not provide for a prospective bidder after the time has passed for
submitting proposals.
   ``MCI's stated intention to submit a proposal in response to any
resolicitation, and its efforts to secure resolicitation by filing a
protest, can do nothing to creat the necessary interested party
status,'' said the court.
   ``By the close of the proposal period, MCI had placed itself
outside the boundaries of interested party status ... Nothing later
proven could alter the fact that MCI did not act on time to become
an interested party with regard to the solicitation.''
   And, said the court, ``nothing alters the fact that MCI was not
an actual or prospective bidder and, therefore, is not an interested
party.''

International Airlines plane after an emergency landing was crushed
to death when the nose gear collapsed, officials said Friday.
   The twin-engine Fokker 27 had landed safely on a flight from
Bahawalpur on Thursday with about 30 passengers and crew after the
pilot alerted Sukkur airport that instruments showed his nose gear
would not lock.
   Ground engineer Akbar Kasim Ali was sent to inspect the nose

   An army general told Western reporters today that
soldiers of the People's Liberation Army fired on unarmed civilians
in Tiananmen Square, then he contradicted himself and denied troops
shot at the protesters.
   In the government's first news conference for Western reporters
since it began cracking down on the movement for democracy, Gen. Li
Zhiyun said troops were forced to use violence to enter the city
because ``people who didn't know the truth'' blocked them on the
outskirts of Beijing.
   Li said soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers later
``exercised restraint'' while clearing student-led demonstrators
from Tiananmen June 3-4.
   ``But still there were some thugs, they (were) still provocative
to the troops. At this time, some of the soldiers in our troops
directed their fire into the square and especially those troops that
have wounded or dead soldiers within their troops,'' the army
spokesman said.
   ``The rest of the soldiers started to fire on those thugs who
were provocative to them.''
   But at another point during the news conference inside the Great
Hall of the People, Le said of the deaths: ``It is not from any
instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This
incident (soldiers firing on citizens) never happened within the
area of Beijing.''
   Li did not clarify the contradiction.
   No news agency reporters were allowed to attend the news
conference or join a subsequent tour of Tiananmen Square. Associated
Press reporters viewed a videotape by CBS television that showed Li
speaking in Chinese and another army official translating his
remarks.
   The government previously denied firing a single shot inside
Tiananmen Square, but has not commented on shooting elsewhere in the
city. Some of the heaviest fighting was a mile away, where civilians
threw firebombs at tanks rolling through barricades erected by
people trying to protect the students.
   The military-sponsored tour of Tiananmen gave selected foreign
reporters their first look at the vast plaza since the military
moved to crush the pro-democracy demonstrations there.
   Reporters who were in the square the night of the crackdown said
there appeared to be less firing there than in other parts of the
city, possibly because the army was trying to avoid scarring it.
   There were reports in the Hong Kong media that tanks rolled over
tents in which students were sleeping, and that soldiers later
burned the bodies. However, Western reporters said they only saw
tanks roll over piles of bedding, but were not sure if people were
crushed.
   All Western reporters fled the square shortly before dawn, after
the army had begun moving into it.
   The government says variously that 200 to 300 people died June
3-4, and that most of those killed were soldiers. Unofficial Chinese
and Western intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed crowds,
killing up to 3,000 people.
   Li said snipers on buildings on the edge of the square opened
fire on soldiers.
   ``In the process of clearing up the blockade (on the square),
some of the thugs, they throw bricks and stones onto the soldiers
and they use sticks to beat up soldiers. Sometimes there were
gunshots from the high buildings.
   ``Some of the soldiers were beaten until they fainted, and even
some were beaten until death,'' Li said.
   Reporters saw soldiers firing indiscriminately at crowds as the
troops moved toward the square.
   Students had occupied the 100-acre square for several weeks
before the crackdown. Tiananmen is in the center of Beijing and is
the symbolic heart of China. On one side stands the former Imperial
Palace; on another is the Great Hall of the People, the current seat
of government.
   Beijing television said the cleanup at the square had been
completed, but it did not say when it would be reopened to the
public. Authorities opened the streets around the square on Tuesday.

   The prosecutor in the perjury trial of Pat
Swindall told jurors today that the former congressman got deeply
involved in negotiations for an illegal money deal and lied
repeatedly about it to a federal grand jury.
   But Swindall's attorneys argued that, throughout his grand jury
testimony, he acknowledged the very matters he is charged with
trying to conceal. And they accused the government of vindictive
prosecution.
   In his closing statement at the 4-week-old trial, prosecutor
Craig Gillen detailed for the jury the nine perjury counts against
Swindall. The two-term Republican lost his congressional seat in
Atlanta's eastern suburbs to Democrat Ben Jones last November.
   Gillen began by citing Swindall's testimony that he was ``never
satisfied with respect to criminality'' of the proposed money deal.
   But the prosecutor said after Swindall was told to his face that
the money he was seeking was the product of narcotics trafficking,
``What does the former representative from the Fourth District have
to say? ... He says, `I can assure you that anything you tell me is
in total confidence.'''
   The undercover agent at that meeting was ``telling this to a
citizen, a lawyer, a United States congressman. Did Patrick L.
Swindall know it was illegal? He sure did,'' said Gillen.
   Gillen also slammed Swindall for telling the grand jury he didn't
recall being told narcotics dollars were involved, even though tapes
played for the jury showed that statement was made to him three
times at a posh West Virginia resort.
   ``Do you think you would remember,'' Gillen asked the jury, ``if
you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal at one of
the ritziest resorts in America? He tells you narcotics dollars are
involved ... and what he does violates currency laws. Do you think
you would remember? Do you think you could ever forget?''
   In a closing statement for the defense, attorney Tom Thrash
charged that the U.S. attorney's office was ``trying to add a former
congressman to the trophy case. Truth, justice, fairness is all
thrown out the window in their desperation to convict Mr. Swindall.''
   Thrash discussed each of the counts in the indictment, as Gillen
had, but he pointed to numerous times during the grand jury
testimony when Swindall acknowledged details that he elsewhere said
he could not recall.
   He urged the jury to look at Swindall's testimony in its entirety
and ask themselves, ``Did he have a specific intent to lie? ...
You've got to believe that he did not. He would not have said what
he said if it was his intent to deceive the grand jury.''
   Another defense attorney, Richard Hendrix, said Swindall was
tired on the day of his grand jury testimony and that the former
congressman's attorney had tried to get the testimony delayed
because of Swindall's condition. He said Swindall ``did the best he
could.''
   The judge was to instruct the jurors after a lunch break, and
they could get the case as early as this afternoon.
   One juror was excused this morning and will be replaced by an
alternate after he reported that a friend had approached him to talk
about the case.
   Swindall is charged with nine counts of perjury in his Feb. 2,
1988, testimony to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings
with undercover agent Mike Mullaney, posing as a drug-money
launderer, and with Swindall associate Charles LeChasney, later
convicted of money laundering and awaiting sentence. LeChasney
cooperated with prosecutors in Swindall's case.
   Swindall, 38, faces 10 months to five years in prison on each of
the nine counts. Under federal sentencing guidelines which apply to
the case, a conviction brings prison time.
   He negotiated over a period of one month in August and September
1987, seeking $850,000 from the undercover agent's sources for
construction work on the then-congressman's luxurious suburban home.
The money was to go to Swindall through a mortgage company set up by
LeChasney, according to testimony.

<HEAD>Rapist Who Escaped From U.S. Prisons Caught in Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRAMPTON, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who escaped from prisons in the
United States and Canada was captured today near Toronto, police
said.
   Frederick Merrill, 42, was arrested in Brampton, 20 miles north
of Toronto, after officers responding to a report of a break-in at a
house found him nearby, said police Sgt. Steve Jones.
   The officers struggled with Merrill during the capture, and
police confiscated a knife, Jones said. Merrill was being held at
police headquarters.
   The capture ended an intensive manhunt that began May 31 when
Merrill broke out of Toronto's Don jail, apparently by scaling a
barbed-wire fence, running across a roof and climbing down a drain
pipe 50 feet to the ground.
   He had been awaiting sentencing on five charges, including
sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl and beating another woman.
   He had also been convicted of several burglaries in the Toronto
area and was facing three life sentences.
   The May 31 escape was the fourth time Merrill had broken out of
jail since 1967. The three earlier escapes were from Connecticut
prisons.
   Merrill fled the Toronto jail by climbing a fence around a
roof-top exercise yard and sliding down a drainpipe. He disappeared
into Toronto's wooded Don Valley.
   Police initially followed a trail of blood from the exercise yard
after Merrill cut himself on wire atop the 9-foot-high fence he
scaled.
   Police say Merrill came to Canada in 1987 after escaping from
Somers State Prison in Connecticut. He had been awaiting trial for
the 1987 rape and beating of a South Windsor, Conn., woman when he
escaped on Aug. 23, 1987.
   Merrill used assumed names and eluded capture for 13 months
before being arrested in an apple orchard in New Brunswick on Sept.
23, 1988. Royal Canadian Mounted Police got a tip from a viewer of
the program America's Most Wanted that Merrill was working as an
apple picker.
   Merrill first escaped from prison on Christmas Day 1967, when he
had 37 days left to serve on a sentence of two-to-nine years for a
larceny conviction. After placing a dummy in his bed at the old
state prison farm in Enfield, Conn., he climbed a fence and headed
for his mother's Tolland home.
   Merrill made his second escape in 1968. Gladys Merrill delivered
her son a Christmas package of a jar of peanut butter. Hidden inside
was a handcuff key, money and a small handgun.
   On Dec. 19, 1968, Merrill pulled the gun and commandeered a car
from three guards. He met his mother at a motel in Manchester, but
35 minutes later they were stopped at a roadblock.

<HEAD>The Throwaway Society Gets a Magazine of Its Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new magazine, called Garbage, is coming along
to worry about the ecology of diapers and whether the gasoline you
burn driving to the recycling center does more damage to the
environment than recycling the old newspapers will do good.
   It is intended for people like its editor-publisher, Patricia
Poore, who says she worries about how much she throws away.
   ``I think,'' says Ms. Poore, ``we all feel vaguely uneasy and
vaguely guilty when you bring the groceries home and realize that 60
percent of what you've bought is packaging.''
   She thinks there are plenty of potential readers who worry about
what the throwaway society is doing to the quality of life _ to use
two buzzwords of the environmental movement.
   The magazine's full name is Garbage: The Practical Journal for
the Environment. It will start publishing in August.
   Ms. Poore promises the magazine will look at both sides _ the
downside as well as the benefits of environmental actions _ despite
its basic bias.
   ``You have to be pro-environment if you want any quality of life
and possibly if you want any life at all,'' she says.
   When an environmentally sound way of doing things turns out to be
more costly or more inconvenient, Garbage won't whitewash that fact,
Ms. Poore says. ``There often is no easy solution.''
   To show the conflicts that can arise even among those who want to
do the environmentally correct thing, Ms. Poore points to her own
quandry over whether to print the magazine on recycled paper. The
answer may seem obvious, Ms. Poore says, but it was not easy.
   ``The editor in me wanted recycled paper,'' she says. ``The
publisher in me didn't.
   ``Recycled paper looks like whole wheat,'' she says, in her
publisher's pose. ``It has gooky things in it. They say it will
break on the press.
   ``The publisher in me said there was nothing wrong with premium
paper. And the printer told us they would charge 30 percent more to
print it on recycled paper!''
   But the art director and the managing editor confronted her and
said she would be a hypocrite to use virgin paper.
   And the printer, in environmentally conscience Burlington, Vt.,
relented and promised to charge no extra for the first three issues
and see how things come out.
   Further research found ``cross-pointe troy book paper,'' a
recycled paper that ``is very white, and film coated and is easily
recyclable itself,'' Ms. Poore says, so the environment (and the
editor) won the battle, for the moment.
   Ms. Poore is the owner and publisher of The Old-House Journal. It
was a neighborhood paper for owners of brownstones in Brooklyn, N.Y.
when she bought it 11 years ago, just as the preservation movement
was catching on. It now has a circulation ``approaching 165,000.''
   Garbage, she says, will be the only environmental magazine that
is not issued by activists and thus free ``to take the moderator
point of view and to have a sense of humor. If you're the Sierra
Club, you've got to take a worst-case view, and a sense of humor is
a dangerous thing to have.''
   The pros and cons of biodegradable diapers will be examined in
the first issue. The pro is that they self-destruct while the con is
that they introduce human waste into landfills and possibly water
tables.
   The magazine's conclusion: cloth diapers are better.

   A federal appeals court today approved A.H.
Robins Co.'s bankruptcy reorganization plan, which will create a
$2.5 billion fund to cover claims against its ill-fated Dalkon
Shield birth control device.
   The plan also calls for the acquisition of Robins by American
Home Products Corp. of New York in a $700 million stock-swap deal.
American Home had the option of backing out of the deal if appeals
in the case were not settled by next month.
   ``We are extremely gratified ... that our legal position has been
upheld on all accounts,'' said Dennis Drebsky, a Robins attorney.
   In a series of four unanimous opinions, a three-judge panel of
the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the entire scope of the
reorganization.
   The ruling includes a one claimant-one vote plan by which women
injured by the intrauterine device ratified the settlement, and a
separate cash settlement by Robins' insurance company.
   ``I think it's just tremendous news for all Dalkon Shield
claimants,'' added Guerry Thornton, attorney for the Dalkon Shield
Victims Association. ``It means the decade wait for fair treatment
and vindication of their rights is almost over.''
   Robins sought protection from its creditors in August 1985 in the
face of millions of dollars in lawsuits brought by women who said
they suffered injuries ranging from infections, sterility and
miscarriage to children with birth defects caused by the Dalkon
Shield.
   The Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer's reorganization
plan was approved in July 1988 by U.S. District Judge Robert R.
Merhige Jr. and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell N. Shelley, who
jointly presided over numerous court proceedings.
   The reorganization plan created a $2.5 billion trust fund to
compensate about 200,000 women with injury claims against the Dalkon
Shield, which was sold by the company in the early 1970s.
   An appeal argued before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
December challenged the way the court determined that users of of
the intrauterine device had approved the reorganization.
   More than 95 percent of claimants who returned ballots to the
bankruptcy court voted in favor of the plan. But Alan B. Morrison, a
lawyer for the Public Citizen Litigation Group in Washington, said
the votes should have been weighted so that women with larger claims
would have a greater voice in deciding the issue.
   He also said claimants should not have been barred by the
reorganization plan from filing third-party lawsuits to seek damages
from Robins' officers or its insurer.
   Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., Robins' insurer, paid $425 million
to the trust to settle any claims against it.
   Merhige and Shelley tried to come up with a weighted voting plan
but could find no way to estimate each claim in advance, said
Robins' attorney James C. Roberts of Richmond.
   Based on expert testimony, $2.5 billion was the estimated cost of
full compensation for all Dalkon Shield claimants, Roberts said.
Only $100 million of the $2.5 billion compensation package to Dalkon
Shield claimants has been available during the appeal.
   Robins pulled the IUD off the market in 1974 after about 4.5
million of the devices had been distributed in the United States and
abroad. Before entering bankruptcy proceedings, Robins settled 9,400
of approximately 15,000 Dalkon Shield lawsuits with payments of
about $520 million.

   A 20-year-old man will become the first Japanese
citizen to enroll in the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., in
recent years, U.S. officials say.
   Keizo Kitagawa of Ube city in Yamaguchi prefecture, southwest of
Tokyo, will enroll in the academy June 21 as one of 10 foreign
students in the freshman class, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Participants in the International Students Program at the academy
have the same status as normal midshipmen, but cannot enter the U.S.
armed forces after graduation because they are not U.S. citizens,
the statement said.
   Kitagawa studied in the United States for one year in elementary
school, when his father was a visiting professor of engineering at
the University of Michigan, and for one year during high school, the
embassy said.
   Nearly 200 foreign students applied for the 10 freshman class
positions, the embassy said.

   Hundreds of thousands of people attended
a reburial ceremony today for Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956
anti-Soviet revolt who was executed and buried in an unmarked grave.
   The ceremony for Nagy and four colleagues in Heroes' Square
amounted to a catharsis for Hungary and mirrored remarkably swift
political changes.
   For example, the ruling Communist Party, which is following the
Soviet Union's lead in adopting political reforms, began talks this
week with opposition leaders on holding multiparty elections.
   After the ceremony in the square, a motorcade took the coffins to
Rakoskert Cemetery in suburban Budapest, where Nagy and the others
were dumped in unmarked graves after their executions in 1958. The
five were reburied today in marked graves on the same spot, known
simply as Plot 301.
   ``We see this day as a dividing line, which we hope will mean we
can begin to build a new and free Hungary,'' said Andras Kaplar, a
member of the opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum.
   In Washington, the State Department praised the reburial. ``We
see the rehabilitation'' of Nagy ``as part of a larger process, that
of Hungary coming to grips with the truth of its past,'' said
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. ``This was an important day in
Hungary and one that was necessary as the country moves further
along the path of freedom toward democracy.''
   Mourners filled the square and filed past the coffins, where 650
wreaths from across Hungary were piled up. Many people came to
today's ceremony bearing flowers and wearing lapel pins with
portraits of Nagy or the national colors.
   A sixth, empty coffin lay beside the five others. It symbolized
all those who were killed by Soviet tanks and troops that crushed
the revolt and by later reprisals. The names and biographies of 250
young Hungarians executed after the revolt were solemnly read.
   The mourners, estimated by Hungarian television at 250,000
people, included many of Hungary's leading intellectuals, hundreds
of former prisoners in Stalinist camps, and onetime leaders of the
failed revolt for a free Hungary.
   ``This day marks the change of an era,'' said Imre Mecs, who was
sentenced to death after the uprising, in a speech for delivery at
the ceremony.
   ``We are burying a regime that was bad from the start, which was
rejected by the nation, which was forced upon us, and which has
proven bankrupt in every regard,'' Mecs said. He was released from
jail in 1963 after his death sentence was commuted.
   A delegation of the communist-led government headed by Premier
Miklos Nemeth was among those paying their respects.
   Italian Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, U.S. Ambassador Mark
Palmer and diplomats from the Soviet Union and almost all other
nations with embassies in Budapest attended the ceremony.
   Hungarian television began all-day broadcasting of the elaborate
ceremonies. Black flags hung from many buildings in the capital.
   Hungary's neighbors also recalled the events of 1956.
   Austrian television planned a live broadcast of much of the
ceremony.
   The Charter 77 human rights group in Czechoslovakia sent a
message honoring Nagy as ``a symbol of the struggle for freedom,
democracy and embodiment of universal values, which also guide us in
our struggle for social rebirth.''
   However, Romania, Albania and North Korea declined to send
diplomats to the reburial. China, in the throes of its own
crackdown, also did not send a representative.
   In the weeks preceding the reburial, the government and the
Communist Party gave startling reassessments of Nagy, who was
executed in 1958 on trumped-up charges of high treason.
   Reburied along with Nagy were his defense minister, Pal Maleter;
his minister of state, Geza Losonczy; the head of his secretariat,
Jozsef Szilagyi, and journalist and close Nagy associate Miklos
Gimes.
   In a de facto rehabilitation, the government hailed Nagy as an
``outstanding statesman'' this week and the party said he had become
a symbol of communist reform policies.
   Hundreds of exiled survivors of 1956 returned to Budapest for the
funeral, many for the first time.
   Bela Kiraly, who was No. 2 in the military in Nagy's short-lived
government, said: ``The Stalinists forced Bolshevik ideas and the
Soviet system upon the Hungarians. They forged shackles out of
ideology and put the Hungarian nation into irons.''
   Now living in the United States, he returned home for the first
time in 33 years to attend the funeral.
   Speaking for the independent Hungarian youth organization FIDESZ,
Viktor Orban drew applause when he call for the Soviets to withdraw
their troops from Hungary. ``If we muster enough courage, then we
can put an end to communist dictatorship,'' he added.
   This week the party began talks with opposition leaders on
multiparty elections, a goal of the 1956 revolt.
   Until last February, when the party leadership conceded that a
popular uprising began the revolt of 1956, the party had called the
events a counterrevolution.
   The revolt grew out of popular revulsion toward the Stalinist
regime of Matyas Rakosi. It began on Oct. 23, 1956, with mass
demonstrations for a new government and more democracy, which led to
Nagy's rise to power.
   Soviet tanks and troops moved into Budapest on Nov. 4, 1956, to
end the uprising.

   Chinese authorities today ordered two British
journalists from Independent Television News to leave the country
within 24 hours, the commercial network said.
   Reporter Vernon Mann and cameramen John Elphinstone, both based
in London, were detained on Wednesday while filming the aftermath of
the unrest in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province in western
China, and had been held under house arrest in their hotel, ITN said.
   Chinese authorities accused them of violating martial law
regulations, which effectively ban news coverage of the
pro-democracy movement and the enforcement of martial law. ITN said
its journalists had entered China on tourist visas.
   Today, authorities in Chengdu ordered them to leave within 24
hours and told them their passports would be returned at the
airport, the network said. Authorities confiscated their film and
camera equipment.
   The Foreign Office said it had been seeking the release of Mann
and Elphinstone, and was still trying to get television
correspondent Brian Barron of the British Broadcasting Corp. and his
camera crew out of China.
   The BBC said Barron and his crew were detained on Monday and made
to sign confessions. Their passports and travel documents were
confiscated, it said.
   On Wednesday, the BBC in Beijing reported that Barron had been
ordered expelled from China, but the BBC later said that was a
mistake and blamed the error on a problem in translation.
   Chinese authorities on Wednesday ordered the expulsion of two
Beijing-based American journalists, John E. Pomfret of The
Associated Press and Alan W. Pessin of the Voice of America. The
government accused them of violating martial law regulations and
gave them 72 hours to leave the country.

   The first tropical depression of the Atlantic
hurricane season has formed in the southwest Gulf of Mexico about
600 miles south of the U.S. Gulf Coast, forecasters said today.
   Air Force reconnaissance planes located the loose area of
circulation Thursday. As of noon EDT, it had top winds of 35 mph and
was located near latitude 20.5 north and longtitude 93.5 west, or
about 300 miles east of Tampico, Mexico.
   ``It's a very loosely organized system right now,'' said Jack
Bevin, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in nearby
Coral Gables. ``Winds are moving away from the center of the
depression, so conditions do not appear favorable for it to
strengthen.''
   A depression has maximum sustained winds of up to 38. If its
winds reach 39 mph it would be called Tropical Storm Allison. The
Atlantic hurricane season begins in June and ends in November.

   Bank robbers wounded a police officer
today and briefly held another hostage in a siege and shootout in
which one suspect was killed and two may have escaped, authorities
said.
   The four-hour drama ended shortly before 11 a.m., when a
helicopter dropped SWAT team members onto the roof of City National
Bank and a search of the building turned up no suspects, said Police
Chief Richard Fox.
   ``We have one suspect in custody,'' Fox said. ``There currently
may be two more suspects at large.'' They could have escaped during
the shootout, and one may have been wounded, police said.
   As officers surrounded the bank for what they assumed was a
standoff with robbers inside, one suspect's body lay outside. When
the incident ended, police confirmed he was dead, but did not
release his identity.
   The robbers were discovered just before 7 a.m. when a silent
alarm summoned police to the bank, FBI spokesman Paul Miller said.
The first policeman to arrive, Daniel O'Connel, encountered a robber
dressed as a bank guard.
   ``Of course, the officer thought he was a security guard,''
Miller said. ``He went into the bank and was confronted with a
handgun. The gun was pointed at his head. He was disarmed and tied
up.''
   That officer was followed by police Lt. David Miles, who
exchanged shots with the suspects and suffered minor wounds that
would have been more serious except for his bulletproof vest, the
FBI spokesman said.
   ``The officer who had been held hostage broke away and as he went
out of the bank, exchanged shots,'' Miller said. Four bank employees
were taken out a side door by police.
   Police arrested one man outside the bank, and called for a
Spanish translator to mediate between authorities and the person or
persons they believed were inside the bank, Miller said.
   Miles was airlifted to Hollywood Memorial Hospital where
spokeswoman Linda Hamlin said he was in stable condition with
gunshot wounds to the cheek and the groin.
   ``He seems to be OK,'' Hallandale police spokeswoman Marcia
Sanders said.

   Housing construction fell 2.1 percent in May to
the lowest level since the last recession in 1982, the government
reported Friday, but analysts said declining interest rates will
turn the industry around in coming months.
   Mortgage rates peaked at 11.22 percent in March and fell to 10.2
percent by last week, causing many analysts to anticipate a jump in
housing construction last month.
   But after the Commerce Department on Friday reported a decline in
housing activity in May, economists said the drop in rates had come
too late to help last month, but predicted improvement in months
ahead.
   ``It seems to us that the drop in interest rates occurred late in
May and continued in June, so the drop really was not felt in the
May figures,'' said Robert Rosenblatt, an economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association of America.
   ``The impact of interest rates, which we expect to trend downward
for the rest of the year, will have a positive effect on (housing)
starts and we should see an appreciable pickup in the
fall,''Rosenblatt said.
   David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage
Association, agreed, saying that ``we expect single family units to
start going up in the next several months.''
   Until recently, the Federal Reserve had boosted interest rates
for over a year as it sought to restrain economic growth in an
attempt to restrain inflation.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors, said many builders thought last month's drop in mortgage
rates might have been temporary.
   ``Further interest rate declines in June will provide the
evidence needed to bring the markets around,'' he said. ``We expect
the June numbers for housing starts to be higher.''
   At the same time, some analysts were not so sanquine about the
immediate future.
   ``Consumer sentiment generally is slackening,'' said David
Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Homebuilders.
   ``It doesn't seem the trend is getting any better, particularly
single family units,'' contended real estate economist Michael
Summichrest. ``I don't see anything more than a dropoff for the rest
of the year.''
   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments in
May were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million
units, down from 1.34 million in April when construction fell 5.0
percent.
   The pace in May was the slowest since the 1.30 million rate in
December 1982 and represented the fourth consecutive monthly
decline, the longest string since activity slowed for five months in
a row from February through June 1987.
   Commerce said construction of single-family homes was off 4.6
percent in May to an annual rate of 980,000 units, after rising 4.7
percent in April. The April pace followed drops of 4.7 percent in
March and 14.2 percent in February.
   Apartment construction, meanwhile, rose 6.1 percent last month to
an annual rate of 331,000 units. Construction of multi-family units
had fallen 27.1 percent in April and 1.8 percent in March.
   The Northeast led the overall decline in housing construction
last month, down 9.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
186,000 units.
   Declines also were recorded in the Midwest, down 8.9 percent to
245,000 units, and the South, down 1.7 percent to 516,000 units.
   Construction was up 7.4 percent in the West to an annual rate of
364,000 units.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, turned up 0.1 percent in May after a 8.5 percent hike in
April. They had fallen the three previous months.

   Old dynamite was found in an industrial area
near the city's downtown today, forcing an evacuation of a nursing
home and 4,000 Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. workers, authorities said.
   Goodyear spokesman Bill Fair said 4,000 employees from
headquarters, several nearby company offices and a factory were
evacuated about noon. The headquarters are about 100 yards from
where the dynamite was found.
   Officials ordered an evacuation of people within 2,000 feet of
the site, between one-third and one-half mile, said fire Capt. John
Roble. The affected area is just east of the downtown and about five
blocks north of Interstate 76.
   The total number of people affected by the order, in addition to
the Goodyear workers, could not immediately be determined. A woman
who answered the telephone at Middlebury Manor nursing home said 150
people were evacuated there.
   Roble said the dynamite was found at Guran Concrete &amp; Supply Co.
as workers were cleaning a warehouse. They forced open the lid of a
container and found the explosives inside.
   Roble said the dynamite may have been for highway construction in
the 1960s.
   About 10 to 12 cases of dynamite were found on the grounds of a
cement company adjacent to a Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. plant, said
Tony O'Leary, an aide to Mayor Don Plusquellic.
   O'Leary said earlier that a bomb squad would try to determine
whether the dynamite could be moved. If not, he had said, people in
nearby homes and businesses would be evacuated.
   He said officials then would neutralize the dynamite and burn it.
   Traffic in the area was rerouted.
   O'Leary said the mayor's office was alerted to the discovery
about 11 a.m.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Take Another Steep Jump in May</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans paid more for food, clothing and
gasoline last month, pushing the Consumer Price Index up a steep 0.6
percent, the government said Friday in a report analysts cited as
evidence of a stubborn inflation problem.
   Consumer prices, which had advanced an even stronger 0.7 percent
in April, have risen at an annual rate of 6.7 percent so far this
year, compared with price increases of 4.4 percent during 1987 and
1988.
   ``It's not a pretty picture,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``The basic message here
is that inflation is tenacious and it's not going to painlessly melt
away.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
called the May price increase ``disappointing'' but said
administration officials ``continue to believe that inflation will
remain low and under control.''
   While prices rose in every major category last month, the Labor
Department attributed about one-fourth of the overall May increase
to a 3.9 percent uptick in gasoline prices. That gain came on top of
a startling 11.4 percent increase in gas prices during the previous
month, the largest jump on record.
   Analysts said the latest inflation report makes it unlikely that
the Federal Reserve will act again in the near future to reduce
interest rates.
   The central bank in March 1988 began a 15-month campaign in which
it nudged interest rates upward in an attempt to curb inflation by
restraining economy growth. Last week, the Fed slightly eased its
grip on the money supply in the belief that the slowing economy
would help to tame inflation.
   ``I think the Fed cannot ease again any time soon,'' Steinberg
said. ``It's going to have to see a whole lot of economic weakening
before it can ease again.''
   New evidence of the drag that higher interest rates have been on
economic growth became available Friday when the Commerce Department
reported that construction of new homes and apartments declined in
May for the fourth straight month.
   Housing starts declined 2.1 percent last month to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million units, the lowest level since
the 1982 recession.
   May's rise in the Consumer Price Index was heavily influenced by
a 0.6 percent increase in costs for food and beverages. Prices for
fruits and vegetables shot up 3.2 percent and poultry costs rose by
a like margin.
   Energy costs, meanwhile, increased 1.6 percent in May, after
shooting up 5.1 percent in April. The uptick in both months was
largely due to the surge in gasoline prices.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, all other
consumer prices still were up a solid 0.5 percent in May after
rising 0.2 percent in April. Many analysts believe these figures
represent the ``core'' level of underlying inflationary pressures in
the economy.
   ``Reports of inflation's demise have been grossly exaggerated,''
said economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage
Association. ``The core doesn't appear to be subsiding and, with the
economy running close to full employment, will edge up as the year
goes on.''
   Apparel prices also showed a strong increase in May, rising 0.8
percent after a 0.3 percent rise in April. Smaller-than-usual price
declines for women's and girls' clothing were largely responsible
for the seasonally adjusted increase.
   Stacy Kottman, research coordinator for the Economic Forecasting
Center at Georgia State University, said last year's ``fashion
bust'' may have created pent-up demand for clothing this year that
allowed retailers to delay seasonal markdowns.
   Kottman said that despite the persistence of inflation in May,
price increases could return to the 4 percent range later this year
as upward pressure on food and energy costs eases.
   ``It's not a good report, but we can look forward to a plateauing
of this increase,'' Kottman said. ``In the last half of 1989, the
(inflation) range will come down.''
   The various May price changes left the overall Consumer Price
Index at 123.8 percent of its 1982-84 base. This means that a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during the base period
would have cost $123.80 last month, 70 cents more than in April.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 1.3
percent in May after rising 0.5 percent a month earlier.
   Average weekly earnings in May, before adjusting for inflation,
were $331.20, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.4
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the
12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 1.9 percent.

   Relations between the Vatican and the
U.S. Catholic Church have never been better, the president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops said today.
   ``I believe that the bridge between Rome and the United States is
stronger than it has been in recent memory,'' said Archbishop John
L. May of St. Louis.
   May spoke after a morning Mass that opened the annual spring
meeting of the nation's 300 bishops. His address also expressed
support for a document that proposes ways to resolve disputes
between bishops and theologians.
   The bishops are scheduled to vote Saturday on the proposal, which
has been criticized by the Vatican for appearing to place bishops
and theologians on equal levels. The bishops also were expected to
tackle other controversial topics, such as normalizing relations
with Vietnam.
   The tone of May's talk contrasted markedly with a speech given by
his predecessor, Archbishop James Malone of Youngstown, Ohio, before
a bishops' meeting in 1986. Malone spoke of a growing disaffection
among segments of the church in the United States with Rome.
   May said today he believes relations have improved because of a
series of encounters among the two groups, including the pope's U.S.
visit in 1987, meetings with individual bishops last year, and a
March meeting of cardinals and archbishops with Vatican officials.
   The recent meetings showed that ``whatever differences there are
have to do with approach and not with doctrine,'' he said.
   May also appealed for the bishops to approve a proposed document
on doctrinal responsibilities that has drawn substantial criticism
from the Vatican.
   He said the document submitted by the bishops' Committee on
Doctrine tries to foster legitimate diversity in theology, while
upholding the authority of the magisterium, or church hierarchy.
   In March, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome
said the proposed document, which advocates the ``rights'' of
theologians to lawful freedom of inquiry and expression of scholarly
opinion, gives the impression bishops and theologians are on an
equal footing, and ``tends logically to the erection of a second
teaching authority in the Church.''
   The most celebrated dispute in the U.S. involves the Rev. Charles
Curran, a priest who lost his license to teach moral theology at the
Catholic University of America in Washington for his opposition to
some church teaching, particularly in the area of sexual ethics.
   The bishops also are scheduled to vote on a statement calling for
a normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam,
said Michael Hurley, spokesman for the Newark Archdiocese.
   The four-day meeting at Seton Hall University ends Monday.

<TEXT>
   A minor earthquake rattled parts of
north-central Kansas Friday morning, but no serious damage or
injuries were reported, authorities said.
   The temblor measured 3.8 on the Richter scale of ground motion
when it hit at 9:54 a.m., according to the Kansas Geological Survey
in Lawrence.
   It was centered about 6 miles southeast of Palco and was felt in
the towns of Palco and Plainville, said Don Steeples, the survey's
deputy director. Some minor plaster damage was reported in a house
southeast of Palco.
   A quake in the same area June 8 registered 4 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. A quake of 3.5 can cause slight damage and one of 4
can cause moderate damage.

   The Energy Department said today it expected to
go ahead with plans for a new plutonium refinery in Idaho despite a
House panel's recommendation that the department be stopped from
starting construction next year.
   ``We still stand on our position that (it) is a very important
and vital project,'' said Kathy Kaliniak, a department spokeswoman.
   A special panel of the House Armed Services Committee voted in
closed session Thursday to recommend delaying the start of
construction at the plant, which the department contends will assure
supplies of plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   The panel's decision adds to congressional pressure on the Bush
administration to seek negotiations with Moscow to ban production of
nuclear weapons materials.
   The panel, chaired by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., recommended
slashing $75 million from the administration's 1990 budget request
for the plant, known as the Special Isotope Separation project.
   The panel also stipulated that none of the $121 million that
would remain for the project in 1990 could be used for construction
or site preparation, said Chuck Fant, a Spratt aide.
   The plant is scheduled for construction at the federal Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. It would use a
yet-to-be-developed laser technology to convert fuel-grade plutonium
to weapon-grade material for nuclear weapons.
   The Energy Department had planned to begin preparing the site for
construction this month. It already has spent $588 million on
development of the technology.
   The Spratt panel was created earlier this year to review the
administration's plans for modernizing the problem-plagued weapons
program and cleaning up its wastes. The panel advises the Armed
Services Committee, and its recommendations will go to a regular
Armed Services subcommittee on military procurement.
   An environmental group opposed to the Idaho project hailed the
panel's decision as a sign that ``the tide has turned against'' the
project, expected to cost $3.1 billion.
   ``The plant has never been needed and it will never be needed,''
the Snake River Alliance said in a statement issued from Boise,
Idaho, after the Spratt panel acted.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has lobbied hard for the
project, which he contends is needed to ensure an adequate supply of
weapon-grade plutonium in the late 1990s.
   Fant predicted the full House would go along with the Spratt
panel's recommended cuts.
   Opponents of the project, including many leading members of
Congress, contend the United States has more than adequate supplies
of plutonium and that embarking on additional production would hurt
chances for new superpower arms control deals.
   A group of 29 scientists and arms control experts last month
urged Congress to reconsider the Idaho project, saying it was not
needed for national security and would undermine U.S. efforts to
limit the spread of nuclear weapons.
   Spratt said earlier this week that he opposed starting
construction in Idaho in 1990, saying, ``while the requirement for
plutonium is real, it is not compelling.'' Reflecting a view widely
held in the House, Spratt said delaying construction would ``buy
time'' for the United States to negotiate arms issues with the
Soviets.
   Spratt also said a delay would allow time to complete a critical
set of experiments on the isotope separation technology. He said the
tests could not be finished before next fall.
   The House and Senate are considering bills aimed at compelling
the administration to seek negotiations with the Soviet Union to ban
plutonium production. Bush opposes the bills. The Soviets have
expressed interest in a mutual ban.
   The administration also is encountering stiff congressional
opposition to its plans for building two nuclear reactors _ one in
Idaho and another in South Carolina _ to produce tritium, a
radioactive gas used in making nuclear warheads.
   The Spratt panel decided to recommend authorizing the $303
million sought by the administration for development of the new
tritium-producing reactors in 1990, Fant said.
   A bid by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., to cut $100 million from
the program was defeated in a close vote, Fant said.

<HEAD>Radical Agriultural Reforms Needed to Prevent Hunger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of parliament on Friday predicted a famine
if radical agricultural reform is not undertaken in the next year,
and he blamed bureaucrats for the miserable performance of Soviet
farms.
   Other members of the parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, told a news confernce that agricultural reform must be a
top priority, but said widespread hunger was unlikely.
   ``I am sure that if radical transformations are not undertaken
next year there will be famine waiting for us,'' said deputy
Vladimir Tikhonov, an economist.
   Tikhonov noted that the Soviet Union is forced to import potatoes
even though large tracts of land are well-suited to raising a
substantial crop.
   He also criticized low agricultural productivity that results in
chronic shortages of meat, fruit, vegetables and grain needed for
flour. The Soviet Union also must import grain.
   He said the country may have to reduce imports because of a
shortage of hard currency.
   Despite attempts at agricultural reform in President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic revival program, such products as meat, sugar,
butter and potatoes are rationed in many parts of the country.
   Tikhonov said the key to improving farm production lies in land
reform and reducing the massive state bureaucracy. ``Administrators
are responsible for the crisis,'' he said without elaborating. The
state controls distribution of seed, gasoline, farm machinery and
fertilizer.
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee in March
approved a policy of leasing land to farmers for 50 years, but
maintained the state and cooperative farms that many blame for
shortages.
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, who heads a party commission
to redress agricultural problems, was criticized as incompetent at
the session of the Congress that ended last week.
   Oleg Bogomolov, director of the Institute of Economics and World
Socialist Systems and a parliament deputy, told the news conference
economic reform must begin with agriculture and that peasants must
be given land.
   Commenting on Tikhonov's prognosis, Bogomolov said, ``While the
possibility of famine exists, I don't think it is a probability.''
Bogomolov said a lack of agricultural reform could have
destabilizing effects on the economy in general.
   Leonid Abalkin, head of the Institute of Economics and a
parliament deputy named to head a new government commission on
economic reform, said he didn't think the word ``famine'' was
``quite right,'' but did not offer his own prediction.

   Time Inc. today rejected a $10.7 billion buyout
offer from Paramount Communications Inc previously
planned tender offer for Warner Communications that values Warner at
more than $12.4 billion.
   The move comes amid a complicated, three-way ba. and launched attle
for Time,
which had announced a merger with Warner before Paramount jumped in
with its own bid for Time that was launched June 7.
   Paramount said today it will proceed with its unwanted
$175-a-share bid.
   Time and Warner had been expected to try to salvage their deal,
which would create the world's largest media company.
   After the announcement, Warner stock jumped $3.87{ to $59.50 a
share on the New York Stock Exchange, and Time's slipped $3.87{ to
$167.62{ a share. Paramount stock was down $1 to $58.50 a share.
   Paramount's unsolicited $175-a-share offer was not in the best
interests of the company because it is financially inadequate and
highly conditional, Time said.
   Time said it would pay r either
company.
   In addition, Time filed a lawsuit to block Paramount from taking
any steps ``to disrupt the merger'' of Time and Warner
Communications Inc.
   The suit, filed at federal court in Manhattan, charged securities
laws violations and sought a preliminary injunction to prevent
Paramount from ``aquiring or attempting to acquire any shares of
Time's stock'' and ``making or attempting to make any tender offer''
for Time's securities.
   The lawsuit charged that Paramount made false and misleading
statements in its tender offer.
   Paramount, calling Time's bid for Warner ``a defensive device,
pure and simple,'' said it would continue its pursuit of Time.
   ``From the standpoint of Time shareholders, we don't see how it
begins to compare with our offer of $175 a share in cash for all
share,'' Paramount said.
   Securities analysts said the bid for Warner does little to
resolve Time's battle with Paramount.
   Peter Appert, the media analyst for the investment firm C.J.
Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., said Time still has the problem of
``figuring out a way to get to its shareholders value that is
equal'' to the $175 a share Paramount has offered.
   One way for Time to increase shareholder value would be to pay a
special cash dividend. But Appert doubted whether Time could afford
to acquire Warner and pay the dividend.
   He said the decline in Time's stock price today indicated Wall
Street is skeptical that the Time bid for Warner will be successful.
If the market thought the bid would be successfully completed, he
said Time's stock price would be down ``substantially more.''
   Time and Warner agreed in March to merge in an all-stock deal
under which Time stockholders would get a share in the new company,
Time-Warner Inc., for each Time share while Warner shareholders
would get 0.465 of a share of the new company for each of their
Warner shares.
   In today's statement, Time reiterated that it is not for sale.
   ``We are convinced that remaining independent and combining
operations with WCI will best serve the interests of Time, its
stockholders and its other constituencies,'' Time Chairman J.
Richard Munro said.
   Time said its board turned down the Paramount offer because the
bid was highly conditional in terms of obtaining the required $14
billion in financing and securing regulatory approval, which Time
said Paramount might never receive.
   ``An extended delay in the closing of the tender offer would
substantially reduce the present value of the offer to Time
shareholders,'' Time said.
   Paramount, formerly called Gulf &amp; Western Inc., announced its bid
for Time on June 6, just 2{ weeks before Time and Warner
shareholders were to vote on the proposed merger. The tender offer
was formally launched the next day.
   Time and Warner did not immediately say whether their shareholder
meetings, scheduled for June 23, would take place.
   Since Paramount announced its bid there has been intense
speculation on Wall Street over what steps Time and Warner would
take to preserve their planned merger. A Time tender offer for
Warner was among the options the two companies were expected to
explore.
   On Thursday, Paramount Chairman Martin Davis sent a letter to the
Time board, complaining he had not heard from the company, and
indicating he might be willing to sweeten his offer, reportedly to
pressure the Time board.
   In a separate development Thursday, Time and Warner said New York
city officials approved the proposed transfers in ownership of the
six cable franchises in the city owned by either Time or Warner.
   Time and Warner together own cable systems serving about 5.5
million subscribers, but must get permission from local cable
authorities in each case to transfer the ownership to the new
company.

   Officials from the Chinese Embassy have asked to
remain in Canada as refugees, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark
confirmed Friday.
   ``I can confirm that there have been approaches by some officials
of the Chinese Embassy indicating the desire to stay in Canada,''
Clark said outside the House of Commons.
   ``I don't propose to discuss names or numbers or locations or any
details,'' he said. ``I think you will understand that it is in
nobody's interest to get into details at this moment.''
   The Canadian Press news agency quoted an unidentified source as
saying that as of Thursday night, five officials from the Chinese
Embassy and two from the Chinese Consulate in Vancouver, British
Columbia, had asked for refugee status. More may have approached
Canadian immigration officials since then.
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported at least nine people
have asked for refugee status as a result of the violence and
repression used by Chinese authorities this month to end a
pro-democracy movement in China.
   External Affairs spokesman Laurie Storsater said the reluctance
to provide details was ``for primarily security reasons. ... We're
not doing anything that would jeopardize either their safety or that
of their families.''

   Sammy Winder ran off with a Mississippi
man's wife, the man claims in a $600,000 lawsuit against the Denver
Broncos' running back.
   Stanley Spell filed a lawsuit in Madison County Circuit Court
alleging that Winder knew Cecilia Evans Spell was married when he
took her to fancy restaurants and bought her clothing, flowers and
other gifts.
   Winder urged Mrs. Spell in a letter to leave her husband and be
``all Sammy's'' and promised they'd live together in his Madison
County home if she divorced her husband, according to the lawsuit
filed May 26.
   ``I really would not like to comment on that,'' Winder said
Thursday. ``At this moment, no.''
   Mrs. Spell moved out of the couple's home in April, with Winder's
help, the lawsuit says.
   In a May 3 protective order, a judge told Spell to stop
threatening his estranged wife and pay child support of $200 a month.
   Spell is asking for $60,000 for physical and mental distress,
embarrassment and disgrace and $540,000 for punitive damages.
   Winder played in the 1987 and 1988 Super Bowl for the Broncos.

   Jon Voight showed up in court to put in a word
for a friend trying to stay out of jail, but the Academy Award
winning actor was unable to sway the judge.
   Voight appeared Thursday in Van Nuys Municipal Court and asked
Judge Alan Ellis not to return to custody former talk-show host
Willard Jenkins, 54, whom Ellis had released for a waiting job.
   Jenkins was sentenced in March to six months in jail and ordered
to pay $101,981 in back taxes for failing to file state income tax
returns from 1982 to 1985.
   Jenkins, a former host on KABC Talk Radio, got an early release
after telling Ellis he had a job that would pay $10,000 directly to
the state, said Deputy City Attorney Robert Orlich.
   Jenkins did not get the job, described as recording work for a
short film to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival, and returned to
court without the $10,000, but with Voight in tow to plead for him.
   The actor told Ellis that Jenkins' claim of promised employment
was an honest misunderstanding, and offered to pay immediately
$5,000 of his friend's debt.
   ``I beg the mercy of the court ... so Mr. Jenkins can be free to
pay the court and put his work back in order,'' Voight said.
   Ellis said Jenkins would not have been released except for the
claim of a waiting job. He ordered Jenkins back to jail, and the
bailiff took him into custody.

   It's all over but the shouting for the ``Morton
Downey Jr. Show,'' which its confrontational host predicts will be
off the air when it comes up for renewal this September.
   ``I feel bad that this will mean the end of this type of talk
show,'' Downey told the Daily News in Friday's edition. ``No one
will take a chance on it anymore.''
   Downey said the show has been sold in 22 markets, but needs at
least 60 to get renewed. Distributor MCA-TV said it has not decided
the show's fate and is still actively selling it for next season,
the News reported.
   ``It's my guess that it'll be all over in September,'' said
Downey, who routinely insulted his guests and presided over a number
of brawls during taping. ``It's a very sad state of affairs.''
   The Downey show first aired on WWOR-TV in November 1987 and went
into national syndication the following May. At its peak, it was
shown on 72 stations, but several stations have recently either
dropped it or moved it into later time slots. Decreased ratings,
lack of advertiser support and consumer complaints have been blamed.

   ``Miami Vice'' star Edward James Olmos,
receiving an award for portraying Hispanics in a positive light,
said, ``I represent one race, the human race.''
   ``I'm stunned,'' Olmos said Thursday after Mayor Tom Bradley gave
him the Hispanic Academy of Media Arts and Sciences' first award for
an outstanding contribution to the positive image of Hispanics.
   ``He is proof that talent knows no ethnic boundaries,'' Bradley
said.
   The ``Imagen'' award, Spanish for image, was given to the
42-year-old Olmos for his role as math teacher Jaime Escalante. In
the movie ``Stand and Deliver,'' the teacher shaped a group of
scholastic misfits into star students.
   ``You're always humbled by anything you do that gets positive
feedback,'' said Olmos, who was nominated in 1988 for an Academy
Award for his Escalante role.
   The actor, who also won a Tony Award for his performance in
``Zoot Suit,'' said he wants to inspire Hispanic youths and destroy
stereotypes.
   On the television show ``Miami Vice,'' Olmos played the steely
Lt. Martin Castillo, a role which brought him an Emmy and a Golden
Globe.

<TEXT>
   A spokeswoman said Friday that the State
Department was disappointed that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev failed to promise unconditionally to tear down the Berlin
Wall.
   Gorbachev, drawing praise Thursday from West German officials,
said the wall between East Germany and West Germany could come down
``when those conditions that created it fall away.''
   ``We noted President Gorbachev's remarks that the wall could come
down some day,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``We just wish he would drop the words `some day,''' she added.
``The West consistently has called for the wall to come down
immediately,'' she said.
   The most recent such appeal was made by President Bush in a
speech he gave in the West German town of Mainz earlier this month.
   ``It is disappointing that Gorbachev said that the wall could
only come down'' when conditions that created a need for it
disappear, Ms. Tutwiler said. ``The wall can never be justified.''
   East Germany has maintained the 100-mile wall is needed to
prevent skilled workers from leaving the country and endangering the
economy. The United States has responded that the wall drives a
wedge between the German people and perpetuates tensions in Europe.
   Gorbachev, winding up a visit to West Germany, told reporters
that ``the wall was raised in a concrete situation and was not
dictated only by evil intention.'' It ``can disappear when those
conditions that created it fall away,'' he added.
   West German officials praised the remarks, saying Gorbachev's
willingness to discuss the matter suggested a new phase in the
Kremlin's dealings there.
   But Ms. Tutwiler disagreed, saying ``such a statement represents
what Gorbachev himself calls `old thinking.''' The Bush
administration has urged the reform-minded Soviet leader to
demonstrate new thinking by allowing more domestic liberalization
and relaxing Kremlin control over its allies.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department criticized Israel Friday
for closing down the offices of a prominent Palestinian intellectual
blamed for directing an 18-month uprising against Israeli rule of
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The criticism came as Soviet and U.S. officials held a second day
of talks on ways of advancing peace talks between Israel, the 1.7
million Palestinians under its control and Israel's Arab neighbors.
   The talks at the State Department are a continuation of the
periodic consultations between the superpowers begun by the previous
U.S. administration to foster cooperation in various parts of the
world.
   But U.S. officials say this time the discussions on the Middle
East could result in a role for the Soviet Union in the so-called
Arab-Israeli peace process, which has so far been orchestrated
mostly by the United States.
   ``The Soviets have been making some positive comments in recent
months that could give them a concrete role,'' said one official,
who asked not to be named.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler declined to
discuss specifics of the talks, saying only they had been
``constructive.''
   The United States wants the Soviets to use their influence with
the hardline Arab states like Syria and Iraq, as well as the
Palestine Liberation Organization, to push forward Arab-Israeli
peace talks. But it continues to insist the Soviets can only become
active partners in the dialogue if they renew the diplomatic ties
they broke with Israel in 1967.
   Tutwiler said Israel's decision to shut the offices of Sari
Nusseibeh, an Islamic philosophy professor and journalist with close
ties to PLO leader Yasser Arafat, was counterproductive to its
recent proposal for elections of Palestinian negotiators in the
occupied territories.
   ``We are disturbed by actions such as this,''' she said. ``At a
time when Israel has put forth a positive and constructive
initiative aimed at reaching out to Palestinians, it's hard to see
how this step can be helpful.''
   If, as Israel contends, Nusseibeh has engaged in ``illegal
activities, he should be afforded an appropriate, open judicial
proceeding,'' Tutwiler added.
   The Nusseibeh case, which has attracted wide attention because of
his ties with Western journalists, is likely to come up in talks
Friday between State Department officials and Israeli Justice
Minister Dan Meridor.

   The U.S. government observed the 13th
anniversary of the Soweto township riots in South Africa with a call
on Friday for the release of imprisoned black nationalist leader
Nelson Mandela.
   ``Since that day in 1976 the tragedy of Soweto has been played
out again and again,'' said a statement released by the State
Department. ``The United States deplores the continuing resort to
violence by all parties in South Africa.''
   The statement renewed the U.S. call for the release of Mandela,
the 70-year-old leader of the banned African National Congress who
was sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy
to topple the white-minority government. At that time he had already
been imprisoned for three years for incitement and leaving the
country illegally.
   The department also urged freedom for ``other political
prisoners'' and an end to the declared state of emergency under
which legal rights of South Africans have been suspended in response
to opposition to apartheid.
   ``We urge the South African government and its opponents to enter
into serious negotiations leading to the dismantling of apartheid
and its replacement by a just social order,'' the department said.
   The riots that began in Soweto, a large township outside
Johannesburg, on June 16, 1976, spread to other parts of South
Africa in succeeding months, leading to the deaths of an estimated
700 blacks.

   Authorities took Western reporters to Tiananmen
Square today and told them that soldiers did not shoot any
demonstrators there.
   One army general said troops did fire into the square because
they were forced to use violence to clear the area of pro-democracy
protesters. Then the general reversed himself and said soldiers did
not shoot at protesters.
   In other developments:
   _The leading national daily lauded the hard-line tactics of
senior leader Deng Xiaoping and appealed for ``unity of thinking''
in a sign that China's rulers intend to stamp out all political
dissent.
   _An aide to Premier Li Peng said members of the Chinese
leadership were guilty of supporting the demonstrators.
   _British officials said Chinese authorities have ordered two
British journalists to leave the China within 24 hours.
   _The American Committee of the International Press Institute
criticized China for expelling two American journalists earlier this
week.
   The government previously said troops did not fire a single shot
in Tiananmen Square, which soldiers and tanks cleared of thousands
of protesters when the crackdown began on the night of June 3-4. The
government has not commented on shooting elsewhere in Beijing.
   Gen. Li Zhiyun told reporters today that troops were forced to
use violence to enter the city and clear Tiananmen because ``people
who didn't know the truth'' blocked them on the outskirts of Beijing.
   ``But still there were some thugs, they (were) still provocative
to the troops. At this time, some of the soldiers in our troops
directed their fire into the square,'' he said during the first news
conference for Western reporters since the crackdown began.
   At another point Li said of the deaths: ``It is not from any
instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This
incident never happened within the area of Beijing.''
   He did not clarify the contradiction.
   News agencies were not allowed to attend the news conference.
Associated Press reporters viewed a videotape by CBS television that
showed Li speaking in Chinese through an army translator.
   The government's call for unity by the Communist Party's People's
Daily came as the state moved to expunge opposition through arrests,to
put out the blaze after it ran through a protest barricade,
killing six people.
   The three were the first to receive the death sentence of more
than 1,000 people arrested since nationwide protests broke out after
the crackdown in Beijing.
   Most of those arrested have been workers, but the government has
also issued all-point bulletins for 21 student leaders. Only three
of those have been arrested or reported to authorities.
   The People's Daily editorial praised the ``keen insight and
scientific judgment'' of the 84-year-old Deng in his June 9 address
to military officers involved in the attack in the capital.
   The government variously says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers,
were killed. Unofficial Chinese and Western intelligence reports say
troops fired on unarmed crowds and killed up to 3,000.
   The editorial said the rebellion in Beijing has been put down but
``some people still harbor ideological hangups.
   ``Therefore, it is necessary to seek unity of thinking covering
the whole party and the whole people by seriously studying the
important speech made by Deng Xiaoping.''
   In an interview with NBC news, Yuan Mu, an assistant to Premier
Li Peng, said today that ``certain individuals'' in China's
leadership were ``guilty of supprting counterrevolutionary turmoil.''
   ``But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be made
public,'' he said.
   Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang has not been seen in public
since the day before Premier Li declared martial law on May 20. Zhao
expressed sympathy for the students.
   The newspaper said China must abide by ``one center and two basic
points.'' The center, it said, is the party and the people. It
defined the two points as principles of communist rule and socialism
in addition to continued open-door and reform policies.
   The editorial indicated the ruling party will no longer tolerate
criticism of its policies, as it did to a limited extent in the
months before the crackdown.
   In his June 9 speech, Deng said the Beijing protesters rallied
under the slogans ``down with the Communist Party'' and ``overturn   Although
many did praise Western democracy, their stated goals
were to open a dialogue with the government, guarantee a free press,
and end corruption among officials.
   Britain's Independent Television News said in London that Chinese
authorities today ordered two of its journalists to leave the
country within 24 hours.
   Reporter Vernon Mann and cameramen John Elphinstone, both based
in London, were detained on Wednesday while filming the aftermath of
the unrest in Sichuan province in western China, and had been held
under house arrest in their hotel, ITN said.
   Chinese authorities accused them of violating martial law
regulations, which ban coverage of the protests.
   On Wednesday, China ordered the expulsion of VOA Beijing bureau
chief Alan Pessin and Associated Press reporter John Pomfret on the
same charges.
   The American Committee of the International Press Institute today
issued a statement in Philadelphia deploring the expulsions as a
setback to the free exchange of information.
   ``It is essential ... that reporters or organizations such as The
Associated Press have the access and opportunity to report,'' said
Eugene L. Roberts, executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and
committee chairman.
   ``We urge the leaders of the People's Republic to reinstate John
Pomfret and to increase, not decrease, access to events in China,''
he said.

   The tiny Dusky seaside sparrow has
become the nation's first bird to become extinct since the
endangered species list was created in 1966, conservationists said
Friday.
   Along with that sad conclusion, conservationists who spent the
past week hiking through miles of chest-high grass and muddy streams
said they were virtually certain that three unaccounted-for hybrid
descendants of the Dusky have also died.
   ``They are gone, all of them,'' said curator-ornithologist
Charlie Cook of Walt Disney World's Discovery Island, where the
hybrids were bred.
   The last known Dusky died in June 1987 in an 8-by-10-foot
screened cage at the island, where it had lived in an environment
simulating its former marshland habitat around the Kennedy Space
Center. But before Requested port out of service.
   Bush's desk was one of four made-to-order about 1920 for the
owners of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co. It was placed in the
company's office in Ohio.
   Later, the CSX Corp., parent company of the C&amp;O Railway donated
the desk to the White House. After his inauguration, Bush used the
desk in his private residential quarters.
   Fitzwater said the desk replaces the one ``used there by
Presidents Kennedy, Carter and Reagan.'' The old desk has been
returned to the White House storage bin.

<HEAD>Bush To Prosecutors: No Deals With Criminals Who Use Guns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors on Friday got orders to be
``especially vigilant'' on stern prosecution of violent offenders as
President Bush directed them not to make deals with criminals who
use guns.
   Bush continued touting the crime package he delivered to Congress
this week, by inviting the nation's 94 U.S. attorneys to the White
House Friday morning and later having lunch with a group of law
enforcement agency heads.
   In remarks to the U.S. attorneys, the president said, ``We're
going to up the stakes for those who calculate that our criminal
justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth the rewards.
And when criminals think about reaching for a gun, they're going to
know _ and they're gong to learn _ that they will do time. Hard
time.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh distributed guidelines to the
U.S. attorneys to implement the president's approach.
   Thornburgh wrote: ``In all but exceptional cases such as those in
which the defendant has provided substantial assistance to the
government in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others,
federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involving
the unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable.''
   The guidelines said that sentencing should reflect ``the totality
and seriousness of the defendant's conduct.''
   ``The specific affirmation of these policies by the president
requires that you be especially vigilant about their full
implementation in your district,'' Thornburgh wrote.
   Bush called the prosecutors ``the commanders at the frontlines''
and urged them to help ``put away the nation's most wanted.''
   ``The situation in our streets has been aptly compared to a
shooting war,'' he told the gathering in the East Room of the White
House.
   The events Friday were to keep the spotlight on the $1.2 billion
legislation he sent to Congress on Thursday with his anti-crime
proposals.
   The package calls for $1 billion in new prison capacity, in
addition to hiring 1,600 new prosecutors to work under the U.S.
attorneys and 825 new federal agents.
   It also calls for doubling the mandatory penalty for use of
semi-automatic weapons in drug or violent crimes to 10 years.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Declares Swindall a Liar in Emotional Closing Arguments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A jury began deliberating federal perjury charges
against Pat Swindall Friday after hearing a prosecutor describe the
former congressman as a liar who ``was willing to deal with the
devil'' _ but only in private.
   The jury got the case about 2:30 p.m. and planned to deliberate
about an hour before going home. U.S. District Judge Richard C.
Freeman said deliberations will continue Saturday.
   In his closing statement in the 4-week-old trial, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Craig Gillen said Swindall knew he was negotiating for an
illegal money deal, made plans to cover his tracks and then lied
repeatedly about it to a grand jury investigating money laundering.
   Defense attorneys said Swindall was guilty of poor judgment in
considering the money deal, but never did anything wrong and did his
best to recall the details for the grand jury.
   Swindall was indicted on nine counts of perjury for lying to a
grand jury on Feb. 2, 1988, about his negotiations with an
undercover agent posing as a money launderer and with a Swindall
associate concerning an $850,000 loan to finish building the former
congressman's luxurious home.
   Gillen noted that Swindall told the grand jury he couldn't recall
being told the money was drug-related and said he had ``walked away
from it, basically.''
   The prosecutor pointed out that in a Sept. 13, 1987, meeting with
the agent and Swindall associate Charles LeChasney, Swindall was
repeatedly told the money was drug-related, but continued to deal.
   ``He will deal with the devil,'' Gillen said. ``He sat there, and
listened to it, and he didn't walk away.''
   Gillen scoffed at the notion that Swindall didn't recall that
meeting with undercover agent Mike Mullaney at West Virginia's posh
Greenbriar resort.
   ``Do you think you would remember,'' Gillen asked the jury, ``if
you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal, at one of
the ritziest resorts in America? And he tells you narcotics dollars
are involved ... what he does violates currency laws?
   ``Do you think you would remember? Do you think you could ever
forget?''
   Swindall, who did not testify in his own defense, sat still, jaw
clenched, as Gillen accused him of lies.
   Swindall's lead defense attorney, Richard Hendrix, admitted to
the jury that Swindall is ``guilty of poor judgment, foolishness,
stupidity and just plain being dumb.''
   But he attacked the credibility of LeChasney, an admitted con man
who testified for the prosecution, and pointed out that former U.S.
Attorney Larry Thompson, advising Swindall before his grand jury
appearance, urged a postponement because of Swindall's fatigue.
   ``Did you believe Larry Thompson? Did you find him a credible
man?'' Hendrix asked. ``If you did, that's reasonable doubt on every
count.''
   Gillen angrily noted that Swindall was granted a postponement of
his appearance but refused in order to keep to his schedule.
   Defense attorney Thomas Thrash accused the government of
``inviting Swindall into a perjury trap'' in order to ``add a United
States congressman to the trophy case.''
   Thrash argued that, in his grand jury testimony, Swindall
acknowledged many of the things he is accused of misleading the
grand jury about. And he said that while Swindall ``is a sinner ...
he's not a criminal.''
   ``In the name of God,'' Thrash whispered to the jury, ``let this
nightmare end _ now.''
   Swindall, under the cloud of the perjury indictment against him,
lost his congressional seat in Atlanta's eastern suburbs to Democrat
Ben Jones last November.

<HEAD>Ancient Village of Chumash Indians Unearthed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA PAULA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ancient Chumash Indian village with
artifacts dating back at least 5,000 years has been discovered by
workers bulldozing a college campus site where a new building was
planned.
   The first artifact buried beneath Thomas Aquinas College was
discovered May 6, said Byron Estes, associate planner for Ventura
County.
   Since the discovery and subsequent excavation, college
administrators, county officials, archaeologists and the Owl Clan of
Chumash Indians have been quietly reinterring remains originally
buried more than 500 years ago, the Santa Paula Chronicle reported
Thursday.
   Archaeologists have long searched for the village contemporary
Chumash knew of as Mupu. They determined in 1976 that Chumash
artifacts were buried around the small Catholic college, nestled in
a largely rural area 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``The bulldozer made its first pass and brought up bones,'' said
C.W. Clewlow of Ancient Enterprises Inc., a cultural resources
consulting firm in Santa Monica.
   ``The remains have been removed and reburied by the Chumash, who
have been wonderfully cooperative about the whole recovery,'' said
Clewlow, a former chief archaeologist at the University of
California, Los Angeles. Clewlow had been involved in the search
since 1976.
   Chumash tribes, usually having 60 to 160 members, lived close to
the Southern California coast, from Santa Monica to San Luis Obispo.
   The Chumash were the only New World Indians to make plank canoes
seaworthy enough to travel in the ocean. The tribes were believed to
have a population of 2,000 when Spanish explorer Juan Cabrillo first
landed on the California shore in 1542.

   A Northwest Airlines jet en route from
Seattle to Detroit made an emergency landing Friday after one of its
engines failed, authorities said.
   Flight 578, a twin-engine Boeing 757, developed problems with one
engine about 100 miles from Bismarck, said Northwest customer

and a crew of seven.
   ``This was the closest airport they could use. They made a nice
approach and landed safety,'' said Charles Cole, a Federal Aviation
Administration manager. ``The pilot did a real nice job.''
   Neither Whitt nor Cole knew the exact cause of the engine problem.
   ``Bismarck isn't quite the vacation place where everyone wants to
go,'' said passenger John Gabryszak, of Valparaiso, Ind.
   ``Nobody was really worried until we started seeing all the
emergency vehicles on the side of the road,'' Gabryszak said. ``But
the pilot and crew handled it really well. We all applauded when we
touched down.''

<HEAD>Eight Positive Premarital AIDS Results Cost $2.5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only state in the nation to require premarital
AIDS testing found only eight cases of the virus in six months at a
cost of $2.5 million, says a study by Illinois' public health chief.
   Dr. Bernard Turnock has fought the Illinois testing program from
the outset and has said repeatedly that the results do not justify
the expense.
   Turnock and a colleague at the Department of Public Health say in
a study published Friday that they found that of the 70,846 marriage
license applicants tested for AIDS in the first six months of the
program, only .011 percent were infected with the AIDS virus.
   Illinois is the only state that requires the tests prior to
issuing marriage licenses. In 1987, 33 states considered similar
legislation, but only Illinois and Louisiana adopted it. Louisiana
repealed its law after six months, according to the article in
Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Illinois adopted the law in 1986, spurred by those who said the
testing would prevent the spread of the AIDS virus among
heterosexuals and their children.
   A move to repeal premarital AIDS testing law is pending in the
state Senate and may come to a vote next week.
   The period Turnock studied was from January to June, 1988. In a
more recent examination, he found that of 150,000 marriage
applicants tested through November 1988, 23 tested positive for the
virus.
   ``The Illinois experience with premarital testing provides a
strong argument against widespread mandatory or publicly supported
HIV antibody screening of low prevalence population,'' the authors
wrote.
   The authors also noted that the number of marriage licenses
issued during the first six months of the program dropped 22.5
percent, as about 10,300 residents traveled to other states to get
married.
   That cost Illinois $77,250 in revenue, they said.

   At least two more Chinese diplomats in the
United States have been granted refuge here, State Department
sources said today.
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President
Bush deplores the persecutions of Chinese demonstrators but has no
current plans to impose further sanctions on China.
   Two diplomats in San Francisco last week were given U.S.
permission to remain in the country. A State Department official
speaking on condition of anonymity said today ``there have been
additional Chinese officials who have asked for protection in the
United States.''
   Such diplomats are covered under Bush's recent order that grants
any Chinese citizen permission to stay in the United States until
June 1990, the official said.
   The Chinese diplomats have not formally asked for asylum, but
could do so in the future, the official said.
   He source declined to specify the number of Chinese diplomats
involved, and said he could not confirm a report that two diplomats
in the Chinese Embassy in Washington had sought such protection.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been negotiating with
Chinese Ambassador Han Xu to resolve a dispute over the Chinese
dissident Fang Lizhi and his wife, who are being shielded in the
U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
   Speaking of administration plans with regard to China, White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We continue to watch
the situation. We'll continue to measure it as we go forward.
Sanctions are always a part of that review, but we have nothing to
announce.''
   Fitzwater, speaking a day after the Chinese government sentenced
some protesters to death, declined to characterize Bush's reaction
to the current effort by Beijing to rewrite the story of the bloody
protest and its claim that no demonstrators were killed.
   But he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows what
happened, despite the Chinese propoganda attempts.
   ``Those matters all speak for themselves ... The pictures and the
reality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind of
efforts stand beside them so starkly that I wouldn't even want to
try to diminish that by giving it words,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater read from a prepared statement, saying, ``The
persecution of people for the exercise of basic human rights such as
the freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of the
press is of course deplorable.''
   Further, he said, ``The aspirations expressed by the people
killed in Tiananmen Square and those who are being persecuted today
will not be stilled by harsh repression.''
   ``We believe that dialogue and reform, not arrests and show
trials, are the route which offer the best hope for stability in
China.''
   The comments bolstered those of a top administration official
Thursday that the United States still can do business with Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping despite his military crackdown and the massacre
of hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people.
   Bush has been reluctant to affix blame for China's bloodshed but
has said it would be ``extraordinarily difficult'' for the United
States to have normal relations with officials responsible for the
massacre of students and workers participating in pro-democracy
protests.
   However, the administration official, a top policymaker in Bush's
inner circle who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S. ties
with China involve ``a very important relationship with a very
important country.''
   Despite the crackdown, the official said, ``China has come a long
way since 1972'' when Washington re-established ties with Beijing.
The official called China ``a great, important country in the world,
and we have great stakes there.''
   ``I think they have made a decision that they're going to restore
order and that they're going to try to rediscipline the system,''
the official said. ``It is not so clear that they have made a major
reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on
before. I think it's premature to make that decision.''
   The official appeared open to continued contacts with Deng,
China's senior leader, who has praised the military for its bloody
assault against Chinese citizens.
   ``He is the head of a very major country. There are lots of heads
of government and state who do things that we don't like that we do
business with,'' the official said.
   ``Are you suggesting we should not have done any business with
(Soviet leaders Nikita) Khrushchev, (Leonid) Brezhnev, anybody who
has done anything wrong?'' the official asked.
   Saying it was premature to say China has abandoned reforms, the
official added, ``It is not so clear that they have made a major
reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on
before.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of radical students hurling
rocks and firebombs battled riot police in five cities Friday, the
second day of widespread anti-government campus protests. About 30
people were injured.
   Violent clashes between students and riot police broke out on
campuses in Seoul, Kwangju, Taejon, Chonju and Taegu after
protesters were blocked from marching into the streets, police
officials said.
   Officials estimated about 5,000 students were involved in the
protests of the government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Students, hurling rocks and firebombs, surged out of their
schools after campus rallies, but police did not fire tear gas.
   Protesters yelled: ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Down with
dictatorship!''
   Fierce fighting erupted at Hankuk University in eastern Seoul,
where about 2,000 students from seven colleges fought police with
more than 1,000 firebombs. Police hurled back rocks thrown by
students but did not use tear gas.
   About 30 students and police were injured in the two-hour clash,
but there were no reports of arrests, police said.
   Student leaders called for the overthrow of Roh and demanded that
they be allowed to take part in a youth festival next month in
communist North Korea. ``March to Pyongyang!'' students chanted as
they beat drums and waved flags.
   Students at Hankuk University marched out of the campus and
attacked riot police blocking the road with wooden clubs and iron
bars. Protesters then attacked with firebombs and several officers
were set ablaze, but the fires were quickly put out by other
troopers.
   Protesters knocked down parts of the school's wall and hurled the
debris at police. Police set up iron barricades in the streets to
hold students back during the fighting that lasted more than an hour.
   The students and allied dissident groups have littlepublic
support because of their extremist views and violent tactics.
   In the southeastern city of Taegu, Roh's hometown, about 50
students attacked a government party office with about a dozen
firebombs, destroying windows. Eleven students were arrested.
   The fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashes
in Seoul and other cities and indicated radical students had
abandoned a self-imposed ban on firebombs. Major student groups said
they would stop using the weapons after seven riot police were
killed in a May 3 campus clash.
   Student leaders, who refused to be identified, said they had been
forced to use firebombs as self-defense against police attacks. But
the fighting Friday all appeared to have been started by students
when police blocked the marches.
   South Korea's government has refused to allow the students to
take part in next month's 13th World Youth Festival in North Korea.
The two nations are bitter rivals and Seoul has accused North Korea
of inciting the unrest.

   Thousands of blacks stayed away from
work and school Friday to mark the 13th anniversary of the Soweto
township riots, in which police opened fire on black schoolchildren
protesting education policies.
   The riots brought a new level of militancy to the anti-apartheid
movement, and the government does not recognize the June 16 Soweto
Day holiday declared by blacks and recognized by most major
employers.
   The U.S. government observed the anniversary with a call for the
release of imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela. At the United
Nations, the Security Council called on South Africa to eliminate
apartheid.
   An estimated 500-700 blacks were killed in nationwide riots that
erupted after police fired on children marching in Soweto to protest
being taught in Afrikaans, the language of the white Afrikaners who
control the government.
   Vandals on Thursday smashed the tombstone of Hector Pieterson, a
13-year-old who was the first person killed June 16, 1976. Friends
said Pieterson's mother found the smashed headstone at a cemetery in
Soweto when she arrived to place flowers on the grave Friday.
   ``The event will remain forever etched in letters of stone and
gold in the history of this land when the children said, `Enough is
enough,''' Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told a church service in
the black township of Manenberg near Cape Town.
   ``When you perpetuate injustice, oppression and exploitation, you
are not just taking on ordinary human beings, you are fighting
against God,'' he said.
   Police used tear gas to disperse 3,000 people who attended a
rally at the Regina Mundi Roman Catholic Church in Soweto, the black
township of 2.5 million outside Johannesburg.
   The crowd of about 3,000 sang, chanted and danced. Police had a
water cannon outside but did not use it.
   Police also fired tear gas to break up a church service outside
Durban, witnesses said.
   A group of blacks apparently attempting to enforce the work
stayaway made a blockade of burning tires and fatally stabbed a
black motorist in Guguletu, a township outside Cape Town, police
said.
   Police reported several buses were stoned and set afire in Natal
province, where officers armed with rifles rode trains and escorted
commuter buses to make sure those who wanted to work could.
   In Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, black commuter traffic was
less than half the weekday average, according to various estimates.
Bus stops, railway stations, and taxi stands were empty. Black
schools nationwide were deserted.
   Buses in Durban traveled under police escort to prevent attacks
by black militants attempting to enforce the work stoppage.
   In the past few years, major employer organizations, such as
those in the steel, garment and supermarket industries, have
included June 16 as a paid holiday in their contracts with unions.
Other businesses, such as mines, have adopted a no-work, no-pay,
no-punishment policy.
   Hundreds of small white-owned shops and cafes throughout the
country have similar policies or close for the day. Almost all
black-owned businesses close.
   The original goal of the marching schoolchildren has been
achieved: they now can choose which language they are taught in. But
other complaints about black education have not been addressed. The
government recently abandoned its plan to make black and white
education standards equal in 10 years, saying the booming population
of black children and reduced government revenues makes it
impossible. The government spends five times as much for every white
child's schooling as it does for each black pupil.
   At the United Nations, U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering, speaking
as president of the U.N. Security Council, said the council
condemned the South African government for its use of force in
Soweto and urged South Africa to eliminate apartheid.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 5 million whites exercise
political and economic control over 28 million blacks.
   The State Department renewed the U.S. call for the release of
Mandela, the 70-year-old ANC leader sentenced to life in prison in
1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government.

   The State Department and the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman welcomed on Friday Cuba's arrest of a
decorated Army general on corruption charges as a potential turning
point in the country's approach to narcotics problems.
   South American drug dealers have been making increasing use of
Cuban air space and territorial waters for U.S.-bound narcotics
deliveries, an activity that U.S. officials last week said strongly
suggested the collaboration of Cuban authorities.
   Cuba is directly in the flight path between Colombia and south
Florida, and the number of suspicious northbound flights through
Cuban airspace has increased in the past several months, according
to administration officials.
   The Coast Guard also has detected an increase in air drops of
drugs into Cuban territorial waters. The cargo is then picked up by
speedboats for delivery to U.S. ports, the officials said.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the Cuban
government has admitted involvement of Cuban officials in drug
smuggling operations,'' Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department
spokesman, said of the arrest of Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa.
   The Cuban party newspaper Granma said Ochoa had been taken into
custoday because he engaged in ``grave acts of corruption and
dishonest use of economic resources.''
   Ochoa is a veteran of fighting in Angola and Ethiopia and also
served as commander of Cuban forces in Nicaragua in the mid-1980s.
According to Rafael Fermoselle, a Cuban exile and an expert on the
Cuban military, Ochoa was awarded the title ``Hero of the
Revolution'' in 1984.
   Ms. Tutwiler noted that the June 15 edition of Cuba's Commmunist
Party newspaper had accused Ochoa and and other officials ``of
making contacts with international drug traffickers and reaching
agreements with them.''
   She also pointed out that Cuba Radio reported that two armed
force officers and four ministry of interior officers had been
arrested, and quoted the report as saying that ``it is possible that
Ochoa and his accomplices cooperated in drug trafficking operations
near Cuban territory.''
   The spokeswoman said the administration hopes ``the charges
against Ochoa and the other officers will be investigated and, if
found true, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., Foreign Relations
Committee chairman, said, ``This arrest could open the way for
mutually beneficial cooperation between the United States and Cuba
to combat the narcotics trafficking that is taking place in the sea
and air space that we share.''
   Pell earlier proposed that the U.S. Coast Guard and the Cuban
border patrol cooperate on narcotics interdiction.

   President Bush tried out his old baseball
throwing arm on Friday when the champion Wichita State University
baseball team visited the White House.
   Receiving the NCAA champs in the Rose Garden, Bush recalled his
own ball playing days for the Yale team, when he and his teammates
made it to the first College World Series finals in 1947 and 1948.
   He said his team had the misfortune of letting the other team's
pitcher, future Boston Red Sox star Jackie Jensen, ``hit a ball
that's still rolling in Kalamazoo, Mich.''
   ``Baseball can keep you humble,'' the president noted.
   He was joined in congratulating the Wichita team by their state's
Republican senators, Bob Dole and Nancy Kassebaum, and by Vice
President Dan Quayle.
   Bush then tossed a few throws with the team's catcher, Eric
Wedge, at one point making a deft but unsuccessful move to catch the
ball behind his back.
   Bush wore a glove, Wedge did not.
   ``I better go to work,'' Bush said laughingly after a few throws.

   Throngs of Hungarians paid homage Friday
to Imre Nagy and others executed for leading the anti-Soviet revolt
of 1956, which Hungary's new communist leaders now call the origin
of their liberal reforms.
   After hours of ceremonies, the remains of the former premier and
four associates were interred again, 31 years after they were put to
death and buried in unmarked graves on the same spot.
   Speeches at the gravesides and at an earlier ceremony in Heroes'
Square reflected both sorrow about a national tragedy and the spirit
that drove the 11-day revolt ended by Soviet tanks on Nov. 4, 1956.
   In the square, the coffins were dispayed on a special platform. A
sixth coffin, empty, was set above them to symbolize all the others
who died in the uprising and subsequent reprisals.
   ``If we can muster enough courage, then we can put an end to
communist dictatorship,'' said Viktor Orban of the independent youth
group, FIDESZ. He demanded the withdrawal of Soviet military forces
from Hungary.
   ``This day marks the change of an era,'' Imre Mecs, who was a
student leader in 1956, told the crowd. ``We are burying a regime
that was bad from the start, which was rejected by the nation, which
was forced upon us and which has proven bankrupt in every regard.''
   People joined hands across the square and said, with Mecs: ``We
swear that we will never again be slaves!''
   At Nagy's grave, Tibor Meray, a journalist who has lived in Paris
since 1956, praised him and his associates as the fathers of
communist reform.
   ``From Prague to Warsaw, from Yerevan to the Peking youth ...
those movements all have their point of departure with you,'' Meray
said at plot 301 in Budapest's Rakoskeresztur cemetery.
   ``The roots of what is happening in Moscow now go back to you,''
he said. ``The epicenter of the earthquake shaking the Communist
world is here in plot 301.''
   Official Stalinist versions of history are being re-examined
throughout the Soviet bloc, inspired by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
``glasnost'' policy of openness and the Soviet leader's own
criticism of Josef Stalin's excesses.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States sees the honoring of Nagy ``as part of a
larger process, that of Hungary coming to grips with the truth of
its past ... as the country moves further along the path of freedom
toward democracy.''
   Those buried with Nagy were his defense minister, Pal Maleter;
Minister of State Geza Losonczy; the head of his secretariat, Joszef
Szilagyi, and journalist Miklos Gimes, a close associate. All but
Szilagyi, who was put to death two months earlier, were executed
June 16, 1958.
   A year ago, police used clubs to disperse a demonstration on the
30th anniversary. The change began in February, when the Communist
Party decided the 1956 revolt began with a popular uprising and was
not a counterrevolution as previously held.
   On Wednesday, a government statement described Nagy as an
``outstanding statesman.''
   Orban, the student leader, mocked the official change of heart.
   ``We cannot understand the party leaders and statesmen who saw to
it that we were taught from books that falsified the revolution, and
now rush to touch the coffins as if they were good luck charmsk,''
he said. The crowd applauded.
   Janos Kadar, who became party chief when the revolt was crushed,
was absent from Friday's ceremony. It was televised live and brought
thousands of exiles hoem from abroad, some for the first time since
1956.
   Kadar, 77 and said to be ailing, lost the party leadership a year
ago and was stripped of his last political posts in May.
   Politburo reformer Imre Pozsgay and Premier Miklos Nemeth, two
rising political stars, laid a wreath at Heroes' Square and stood in
honor guard around Nagy's coffin.
   State TV and the official news agency MTI estimated the crowd at
250,000.
   U.S. Ambassador Mark Palmer was among foreign dignitaries
attending. Absent were Romania, Albania, North Korea and China,
whose military assault on student demonstrators recalled 1956 for
many Hungarians.
   Many with personal memories of the uprising. Younger people wore
black armbands bearing the national colors red, white and green, and
Nagy's photograph or ``56.''
   Bela Kiraly, who commanded the paramilitary national guard under
Nagy, said he had vowed not to return from exile in the United
States ``until and unless the Hungarian people (could) express their
homage to Imre Nagy and his fellow martyrs. Today is that glorious
day.''
   ``The Stalinists forced Bolshevik ideas and the Soviet system
upon the Hungarians,'' he declared to the crowd. ``They forged
shackles out of ideology and put the Hungarian nation into irons.''
   Large Hungarian flags hung in Heroes' Square, with holes cut in
the center and filled with black cloth. During the revolt, many
rebels cut out the Soviet hammer and sickle that was then part of
the national flag.

<HEAD>Two Widows Fight Over Millions Left By Husband</HEAD>

   A man described by an attorney as having
lived two lives left two women claiming to be his widow and fighting
over his $8 million estate.
   A trial is scheduled to start Monday in Circuit Court on which of
two wills left by Harry G. Davis is valid.
   Ruth Davis, 75, of Anniston, and Flossie Davis, 62, of
Tallahassee, Fla., claim to have been married at the same time to
Davis, a real estate developer and farmer in Calhoun County.
   Both women say they learned that their husband had two wives only
after his death.
   After Davis died last year at 77, Flossie Davis presented a will
she said he wrote in 1969 placing most of his estate in a trust fund
for her and their two children, said A.W. Bolt, an attorney for Ruth
Davis.
   Bolt said Ruth is contesting the will on grounds that Davis was
``under undue influence'' of Flossie when he wrote it. Bolt said a
1959 will leaving the estate to Ruth was found three weeks ago. She
and Davis had no children.
   Bolt said Davis lived two lives, spending weekends and holidays
with Flossie in Tallahassee and weekdays on the farm with Ruth.
   After about 30 years of marriage to Ruth, Bolt said, Davis met
the other woman in 1959, when she and her husband worked as tenant
farmers on his property. Bolt said Davis soon became entangled with
Flossie, that Flossie divorced her husband and, with her daughter,
moved in with the Davises.
   ``Ruth started noticing Harry and Flossie fondling one another,''
Bolt said, and she insisted that the other woman move out.
   Instead, Bolt said, Davis had Ruth institutionalized three times
for ``imagining things.''
   He said that while Ruth was under the influence of medication,
Davis had her sign a post-nuptial agreement that essentially cut her
out of any inheritance.
   Flossie claims Davis married her in 1960, and two years later
moved her and her daughter to Tallahassee. ``He bought her a home,
set her up and supported her the rest of his life,'' Bolt said.
   Ruth said she never knew about her husband's marriage to Flossie.
Pat Burnham, Flossie's attorney, said his client had thought her
husband divorced Ruth before their marriage.

   China's leadership intensified efforts Friday to
absolve itself in the deaths of pro-democracy protesters. A
government spokesman also acknowledged for the first time there was
a split among Communist Party officials over how to deal with the
popular uprising.
   Also on Friday, nearly 100 more people were arrested nationwide
for taking part in the protests _ including a fourth person named on
a wanted list of 21 student leaders _ and the government ordered two
more Western reporters to leave the country.
   An army spokesman, Gen. Li Zhiyun, said for the first time that
soldiers fired into Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4, but
later contradicted himself.
   ``Some of the soldiers ... directed their fire into the square,''
Li told selected Western reporters during a news conference at the
Great Hall of the People.
   At another point, however, Li said of the deaths: ``It is not
from any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the
people. This incident never happened within the area of Beijing.''
   Reporters who were not allowed to attend the news conference
obtained the comments by watching a CBS News videotape. Li spoke
through an official translator and did not clarify the remarks.
   Before the news conference, the military took selected Western
reporters on their first tour of the square since the fighting.
   The government campaign appeared aimed at demonstrating that
protesters were not shot while they were inside the 100-acre square,
the symbolic center of power in China.
   Although Tiananmen Square was the focus of the demonstrations,
reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on Changan
Avenue, the main road to the square. But there were conflicting
reports during the confused fighting in the darkness and some
students reported shooting inside the square.
   Other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of the
square and at the bridge at Muxudi, the western gateway to the inner
city. Reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up by
protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   The heaviest fighting occurred on the road to the square and the
government has previously acknowledged that some soldiers shot
civilians to death while pushing their way toward Tiananmen. But
officials have insisted that no shots were fired when troops entered
the square with tanks, and that no one died there.
   The government says the fighting killed nearly 100 soldiers and
police, and about 100 civilians. Chinese witnesses and Western
intelligence estimate the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   China's evening TV news showed crews disinfecting the square,
repairing the pavement and replanting bushes. It did not say when it
would be reopened.
   Soldiers held solemn memorials for troops killed in the fighting.
Shrines were set up on the streets where several soldiers died, and
TV showed residents bowing in front of pictures of the dead.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu, asked in an interview with NBC News
about the fate of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang,
said: ``It is true that certain individuals in the top Chinese
leadership are guilty of supporting the counterrevolutionary _ of
supporting turmoil.''
   ``But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be made
public,'' he said. He did not mention Zhao by name.
   The party chief has not been seen in public since May 19, when he
visited student protesters occupying Tiananmen Square and tearfully
appealed to them to go home. He said with apparent sympathy that the
problems they had raised, including official corruption, would be
resolved with time.
   Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing the next day.
   Sources later said senior leader Deng Xiaoping, joined by aging
conservatives, stripped Zhao of his power, but that he had yet to be
formally removed from office.
   Yuan skirted a question on whether China might invade the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing to arrest dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li
Shuxian, who took refuge there after the army marched into Tiananmen.
   ``He must be brought to justice. We will deal with him according
to legal procedures,'' Yuan said. The translator stumbled on the
reply, saying Fang had been served ``a death _ an arrest warrant.''
   The official media continued its attacks on the protesters and on
Fang, who is accused of plotting to overthrow the party; he did not
participate in the demonstrations.
   Hardliners called on the nation to study the ``penetrating
analysis'' of Deng on the true goals of the seven-week, student-led
movement for a freer society.
   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said: ``This is the most
powerful ideological weapon for lancing every kind of ideological
pimple.''
   It described the students and their supporters as ``a gang of
political hoodlums, the evil remnants of the Gang of Four and other
dregs of society.'' The Gang of Four were the radical leaders of the
1966-76 violent far-left Cultural Revolution.
   The number of arrests reported since the crackdown began climbed
past 1,185. Among arrests announced Friday was Ma Shaofeng, a
24-year-old student from the Beijing Film Academy who was a leader
in the independent student union that organized the protests.
   A radio report said Ma surrendered in southeastern China's
Guangdong province. That left at large 17 of the 21 student leaders
named on a wanted circular distributed Tuesday.
   The government gave two journalists from Britain's Independent
Television Network 24 hours to leave the country. Vernon Mann and
John Elphinstone, both in China on temporary visas, had been filming
the aftermath of protests in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
   Another ITN reporter was ordered expelled from Shanghai last
week. Two Beijing-based reporters, John Pomfret of The Associated
Press and Alan Pessin of the Voice of America, were scheduled to
leave China on Saturday after being ordered out.
   Chinese authorities accused all of the journalists of violating
martial law regulations, which ban coverage of the protests.
   The American Committee of the International Press Institute
issued a statement in Philadelphia deploring the expulsions.
   ``It is essential ... that reporters or organizations such as The
Associated Press have the access and opportunity to report,'' said
Eugene L. Roberts, executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and
committee chairman.
   ``We urge the leaders of the People's Republic to reinstate John
Pomfret and to increase, not decrease, access to events in China,''
he said.

   An army general said Friday that the People's
Liberation Army fired on unarmed civilians when it entered Tiananmen
Square because soldiers were provoked by ``thugs.''
   But at a confusing news conference, Gen. Li Zhiyun later
contradicted that statement, saying soldiers did not shoot at the
protesters.
   The government invited selected journalists to attend the news
conference, the first since it began its crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement, and a subsequent tour of the square.
   News agencies were not allowed to participate. Associated Press
reporters obtained Li's remarks by viewing a videotape made by CBS
News. He spoke through a translator.
   Li said troops were forced to use violence to enter the city on
June 3-4 because ``people who didn't know the truth'' blocked the
soldiers on the outskirts of Beijing.
   He said soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers
``exercised restraint'' in trying to clear student-led demonstrators
from Tiananmen.
   ``But still there were some thugs,'' Li said during the news
conference in the Great Hall of the People near the square. ``At
this time, some of the soldiers in our troops directed their fire
into the square and especially those troops that have wounded or
dead soldiers within their troops.
   ``The rest of the soldiers started fire to those thugs who were
provocative to them.''
   But at another point Li said of the deaths: ``It is not from any
instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This
incident (soldiers firing on citizens) never happened within the
area of Beijing.''
   Li did not clarify the contradiction.
   The government previously had denied that a single shot was fired
in Tiananmen, but had not commented on shooting elsewhere in the
city.
   The government's actions Friday appeared to be part of a campaign
aimed at demonstrating that protesters were not shot while they were
inside the 100-acre square.
   Although Tiananmen Square was the focus of the demonstrations,
reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on Changan
Avenue, the main road to the square. But there were conflicting
reports during the confused fighting in the darkness and some
students reported shooting inside the square.
   Other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of the
square and at the bridge at Muxudi, the western gateway to the inner
city. Reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up by
protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   Li said protesters in Tiananmen attacked soldiers with sticks and
threw stones and bricks, and that snipers fired on them from
buildings on the edge of the square.
   ``Some of the soldiers were beaten until they fainted, and even
some were beaten until death.'' Li said.
   The Xinhua News Agency said nearly 100 soldiers and police died
and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and
nearly 1,000 were injured. It did not account for the discrepancy
with government figures issued last week that said nearly 300 people
died altogether.
   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death
toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   Reporters in the square the night of the crackdown said there
appeared to be less firing there than in other parts of the city.
   There were reports in the Hong Kong media that tanks rolled over
tents in which students were sleeping, and that soldiers later
burned the bodies. Western reporters said they only saw tanks roll
over piles of bedding, but were not sure if people were crushed.
   Reporters saw soldiers firing indiscriminately at crowds as the
troops moved toward the square. Western reporters fled the square
shortly after the army began moving in.
   Students had occupied the square for several weeks before the
crackdown.
   Tiananmen is in the center of Beijing and is the symbolic heart
of China. On one side stands the former Imperial Palace, on another
is the Great Hall of the People, the seat of government.
   It remained closed to pedestrians on Friday.

   By the time the Legislature's supposed 100-day
session adjourned at 6 a.m. Friday in its 159th day, the capital
showed the signs of what college students call an all-nighter.
   Staff members had changed into blue jeans or went barefoot. Empty
champagne bottles, cold cuts and pizza boxes littered a table in
Senate President Bob Usdane's inner office. House members threw wads
of paper at a likeness of Usdane.
   Disagreement between the two houses also was a problem in
neighboring Nevada, where the Legislature commemorated going into a
record 152nd day Friday with black balloons, black gum drops and
black humor.
   ``When do we qualify for food stamps?'' asked Assemblyman Bob
Gaston of Las Vegas.
   When Arizona Senate Majority Leader John Mawhinney warned that
the defeat of a prison-construction bill would leave no room for new
inmates, fellow Republican Sen. Pat Wright offered her office.
   Sen. Jaime Gutierrez, who had stopped shaving weeks ago to
protest the session's length, appeared on the floor without his
beard. He said his wife hadn't seen him in weeks and shaving was
``the quickest way to have my wife open the door.''
   A last glitch holding up lawmakers was an error in a bill to
correct technical mistakes in earlier bills.
   ``I think this exemplifies the session, where we have to send the
correction bill back to be corrected,'' said Rep. Henry Evans.

   The City Council has approved new swimming pool and fence

   ``Let's Polka'' has been the cheer of the
annual Czech Days, which kicked off its 41st year Friday with music
and plenty of kolaches.
   The yearly two-day Bohemian celebration was expected to draw
10,000 vistors to Tabor, a town of 470 people in southeastern South
Dakota near the Missouri River.
   ``The Czechs have a fun-loving tradition,'' Sherry Povondra said.
``We go all-out for social occasions and we try to greet people with
friendliness.
   ``That tradition is carried on during Czech days.''
   Mrs. Povondra and her husband, Dennis, are this year's parade
marshals.
   The event began with Mass at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church,
where ushers dressed in Czech costumes, and the pastor explained the
history of St. Wenceslaus.
   ``What this amounts to is a Christian celebration with a polka
beat,'' said the Rev. Carl Hermann.
   Along with the church, Tabor's main street also was to be given
over Saturday to music, dancing and the eating of kolaches, a
Czechoslovakian pastry that is usually filled with fruit.

<HEAD>Japan, Hong Kong Join Worldwide Effort To Ban Ivory Trade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan and Hong Kong announced Friday they will end
most ivory imports as part of a worldwide effort to protect African
elephants, in danger of being hunted to extinction.
   Japan and Hong Kong were considered particularly critical to any
effective reduction in ivory demand. Japan is the largest importer
and consumer of ivory, accounting for 40 percent of the world
market. Hong Kong is heavily involved in making ivory carvings for
reexport.
   Conservationists estimate African elephant populations have
dropped by half to two-thirds in the past decade, from 1.5 million
in 1978 to between 400,000 and 700,000 today. Ivory exports have
increased from 300 tons a year in the 1950s to more than 800 tons
annually this decade, they say.
   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said the
Japanese ban will take effect Monday. It will exclude raw African
ivory specially certified under an international agreement. Such
ivory accounts for about 13 percent of the imports.
   Hong Kong announced a moratorium on all raw ivory imports but
said traders and importers who had entered into contractual
agreements before Friday were exempt.
   Their pledges came one day after Canada said it will ban ivory
imports.
   Since June 4, the United States, the 12-nation European Economic
Community, and Switzerland also have imposed bans on ivory imports.
   ``It's been a real snowball effect,'' Jorgen Thomsen, senior
program officer for elephant conservation at the World Wildlife
Fund, said Friday.
   The 102-nation Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species will consider a worldwide ban on ivory imports at a Geneva
meeting in October.
   Conservationists feared that prospects of a worldwide ban could
lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killing unless interim
measures were imposed by major importing countries now.
   Ivory is used for the signature stamps popular in many Asian
nations, and for jewelry, piano keys and carvings.
   Though some African countries still permit limited exports of the
certified ivory, four major producers _ Kenya, Tanzania, Gambia and
Somalia _ have called for a total ban on trade in ivory. They say
such action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population of
African elephants.
   Kenya, which banned hunting of African elephants a decade ago,
last year began using police and paramilitary units its war with
poachers. An aerial survey last year found an estimated 20,000
elephants remaining in Kenya, which 15 years ago had a population of
121,000.
   Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in some
countries and are switching to females and young beasts, according
to a conservationists' report this month based on material from
biologists, conservationists, economists and trade specialists.
   As a result, three times as many elephants must be killed to
provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago, the report said.
Most ivory is added late in life among males.
   Tamotsu Ishibashi, chairman of Tokyo Ivory and Craft Cooperative
Association, said the ban will hurt Japan's traditional
ivory-carving industry.
   ``The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of
carving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restriction
certainly will affect them severely,'' Ishibashi said in a telephone
interview.
   About 25,000 ivory craftsman work in 80 Japanese workshops,
producing $13.8 million worth of ivory products every year.

   A missing nine-year-old girl who was
the object of a search by police and 5,500-man NATO force was found
alive Friday, Denmark's public radio said.
   ``She's fine, considering the circumstances,'' said police
commissioner Erik Dissing in the town of Nykoebing Falster. He did
not elaborate.
   Police declined to disclose details of Malene Hansen's 48-hour
disappearance or say how she was found. She was being examined by a
doctor, the radio said.
   Police were checking a report that the girl was picked up by
someone driving a red car when she went missing, the report said.
   Malene disappeared from her home in the town of Sakskoebing in
the Baltic island of Lolland on Wednesday evening.
   NATO's Allied Mobile Force which was holding an exercise in the
area volunteered to aid in the search on Friday.

</TEXT>
<NOTE>CRACKDOWN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   China's government intensified its campaign to absolve itself in
the deaths of the pro-democracy protesters. Gen. Li Zhiyun told
Western reporters that troops were forced to use violence because
``people who didn't know the truth'' blocked them on the outskirts
of Beijing. Li said troops fired into Tiananmen Square to clear the
area of demonstrators, but later reversed himself about the deaths,
saying: ``It is not from any instances from the soldiers directing
their guns at the people. This incident never happened within the
area of Beijing.''

<NOTE>PARTY LEADERSHIP</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese government spokesman Yuan Mu, asked about the fate of
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, said: ``It is true that certain
individuals in the top Chinese leadership are guilty of supporting
the counterrevolutionary _ of supporting turmoil. But their
questions will be dealt with soon and will be made public.''

   Asked whether China might invade the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to

Yuan Mu said: ``He must be brought to justice. We will deal with him
according to legal procedures.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ARRESTS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 more people were arrested nationwide for taking part
in protests, including Ma Shaofeng, a student leader named on a
wanted circular distributed Tuesday. Nearly 1,200 arrests have been
reported since the crackdown.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JOURNALISTS EXPELLED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities ordered two more journalists to leave the
country within 24 hours. Reporter Vernon Mann and cameramen John
Elphinstone from Britain's Independent Television News, detained
Wednesday while filming in Chengdu, are accused of violating martial
law regulations.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PRESS PROTEST</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The American Committee of the International Press Institute
criticized China for expelling two American journalists earlier this
week. ``It is essential to the free exchange of information that
reporters or organizations such as The Associated Press have the
access and opportunity to report,'' the committee said.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DENG</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The official media lauded the hard-line tactics of senior leader
Deng Xiaoping and appealed for ``unity of thinking,'' indicating
that China's rulers intend to stamp out all political dissent. The
People's Daily called the demonstrators an ``ideological pimple''
and said Deng's words were ``the most powerful ideological weapon
for lancing (it).''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>BUSH</NOTE>

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
deplores the persecutions of Chinese demonstrators but has no
current plans to impose further sanctions on China. ``We believe
that dialogue and reform, not arrests and show trials, are the route
which offer the best hope for stability in China,'' he said.

   At least two more Chinese diplomats in the United States have
been granted refuge, State Department sources said. Also, Canadian
External Affairs Minister Joe Clark confirmed that an unspecified

<HEAD>Panel Seeks to Slow Medicare Growth with Rules Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved legislation to
considerably limit the ability of physicians to refer Medicare
patients to laboratories or clinics in which the doctors have a
financial interest.
   The measure is part of a package of nearly $3 billion in Medicare
savings for fiscal 1990 that attempts to curb soaring growth in the
program. It also includes a major overhaul of Medicare spending on
physicians and an unprecedented cap on payments to doctors in the
program.
   The package was approved 11-0 in a closed session Thursday night
by the House Ways and Means health subcommittee and details were
released Friday by the subcommittee staff. It now goes to the full
committee.
   The physician ownership-referral measure, sponsored by Rep. Pete
Stark, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, would allow clinics
and laboratories with physician ownership to continue operating, but
they would have to register with the government. They also would
continue to be subject to current law, which bars direct payments
for referrals.
   For new joint ventures, however, the bill would prohibit
physicians from referring Medicare patients to a facility in which
the doctor or an immediate family member has an ownership or
investment interest.
   Exceptions could be made for a facility that could show it
provides a service unavailable elsewhere.
   A report by the Health and Human Services Department Inspector
General earlier this spring found that patients of physicians who
have a financial stake in clinical labs received 45 percent more lab
services than Medicare patients in general.
   Outlays under the federal health care program for the elderly
would rise from $98.6 billion in the current fiscal year to $111
billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Without the cutbacks,
Medicare would cost $114 billion next year.
   Medicare spending has been increasing about 15 percent annually
since 1980. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, said this week that Medicare spending on
physicians has increased 16 percent annually over the past 10 years.
   Savings would be achieved by squeezing hospitals and physicians
but leaving intact benefits for the 33 million people enrolled in
the program.
   However, the subcommittee's package recognizes the current
financial dilemma faced by many rural and urban hospitals.
   All hospitals would see an increase in Medicare payments next
year, under the panel's recommendation. However, rural and inner
city hospitals would get larger increases than suburban hospitals.
   Physicians would also take a hit, with reimbursement for some
medical procedures considered ``overpriced'' being cut by up to 15
percent. These procedures include coronary bypass surgery and
cataract surgery.
   The physician payment overhaul was approved by the subcommittee
on Wednesday with Bush administration backing.
   The cornerstone of the plan is a national spending target that
would limit Medicare payments to physicians. This feature is opposed
by the American Medical Association, which says it would ration
health care.
   The two other parts of the plan would raise reimbursed charges
for family practioners and internists while lowering them for
surgeons, eye doctors and other specialty practices and limit the
amount physicians can charge their Medicare patients beyond the
reimbursed charge.
   Sullivan told a Senate Finance subcommittee Thursday the
administration supports the three elements of the House
subcommittee's package. But he said the administration would oppose
a change in the physician fee schedule ``if it is not linked to a
volume control mechanism such as an expenditure target.''

<HEAD>House Strips Exemptions From S&amp;L Bill but They're Not Dead Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House, operating under an ethics
microscope, stripped special interest exemptions from a savings and
loan bailout bill at the last minute, but they may resurface in an
anticipated blitz by industry lobbyists.
   Before House members approved the $157 billion taxpayer-financed
S&amp;L rescue just before midnight Thursday, provisions aimed
specifically at benefiting Sears, Citicorp, Chemical Bank of New
York, Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and several other financial houses
suddenly were removed.
   However, lawmakers and outside observers expect the provisions to
come up again when House and Senate negotiators meet later this
month to iron out differences between their two versions of the
legislation. The Senate approved its bill in April.
   ``It's so unlike the Congress to do something like that,'' Bert
Ely, an independent consultant on the S&amp;L industry, said of the
11th-hour removal of the provisions. ``But I know they're going to
come back up in conference because the Senate bill has a bunch of
amendments like that.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee, said
Friday they hope to have the bill ready for President Bush's
signature by July 4.
   House Banking Committee experts who have examined the Senate
version say they count about 40 ``special interest'' provisions in
it intended to benefit specific insurance companies, banks, S&amp;Ls or
other financial institutions.
   The biggest, according to Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, is a provision
that would allow Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly
Hills, Calif., to exceed federal restrictions on how many high-risk,
high-interest junk bonds S&amp;Ls can own.
   According to Leach, the Senate provision was inserted at the
behest of Columbia, which has the largest portfolio of junk bonds of
any S&amp;L in the country.
   Columbia also was involved in the junk bond deal that helped
bring about House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho's resignation. Coelho,
who left Congress Thursday, made about $6,880 in four months in 1986
after an executive of the S&amp;L bought the bonds and held them for
Coelho until the congressman could raise the money, partly through a
loan from the S&amp;L.
   Leach, a leading GOP proponent of making S&amp;Ls as well as banks
and other financial institutions meet much stricter accountability
standards, was the primary force behind knocking the special
interest provisions out of the House bill.
   In a parliamentary move that caught both many Democrats and
fellow Republicans by surprise, he asked _ minutes before lawmakers
were scheduled to vote on final passage _ that the House send the
bill back to its Banking Committee with instructions to immediately
return it without the provisions he was opposing.
   ``Frankly, it was something that I had had in the back of my mind
for three or four days,'' he said in an interview Friday. ``It's
because of the greatest legislative lapse of this century that we
have this problem If we're going to ask the public to pay for it to
the tune of $500 for every man, woman and child, people here should
make it clear there are no special benefits to the large and
well-heeled.''
   As the bill was structured when it went to the House floor, only
Republicans were allowed to offer amendments weakening Bush's demand
for strong regulatory requirements.
   Under the debate procedure set by the Democratic-controlled House
Rules Committee, Democrats were allowed to introduce and pass
several ``reform'' amendments.
   Among them were a measure opposed by Drexel Burnham, the nation's
largest underwriter of junk bonds, to forbid all S&amp;L investments in
the high-risk securities and a measure opposed by the American
Bankers Association to establish $1-million-a-day civil fines for
bank fraud.
   When the vote on Leach's motion began, Republicans automatically
supported it as a protest and Democrats at first voted against it.
But soon Democrats started switching their votes. When the final
vote was tabulated, Leach won 411-8.
   ``The sentiment among a lot of Democrats was that he was right,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who had been criticized by
members of both parties close to S&amp;L interests as being the
``administration's pawn'' in seeking tougher regulations on the
industry.
   Foley called Leach's use of the parliamentary tactic one of the
most successful he had ever seen. Gonzalez said Democrats had no
choice but to go along with it so they could say, ``Look, we're on
the high road, too. We're not for these special interests and
giveaways.''
   Democrats who had sponsored the special exemptions _ among them
Reps. Carroll Hubbard of Kentucky, Bill Nelson of Florida and Doug
Barnard of Georgia _ ``didn't realize until it was too late'' what
was happening, Gonzalez said.

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon unit set up six years ago to test
weapons was criticized by a Senate panel Friday for hiring defense
contractors to do the tests.
   ``We wanted a tough junkyard dog who would stop bad weapons.
However, what we seem to have created is just another layer to the
Pentagon bureaucracy,'' Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said in prepared
remarks at a hearing of a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee.
   ``Congress has been so disappointed in the testing office that
some have spoken of eliminating it.'
   ``Six years after setting up the testing office, America is still
sending poorly tested weapons to the troops and spending billions
due to misleading or incomplete test reports,'' he said.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., added in a statement that ``it is
no secret that the (testing) office has been a terrible
disappointment to many members of Congress.''
   The staff of the federal services subcommittee chaired by Pryor
compiled a report on the Pentagon's Office of Operational Test and
Evaluation, the top weapons testing office. Data came from the
General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency, from
the Defense Department's inspector general, and from other sources.
   ``Contractors with ties to weapons being tested regularly review
test plans, analyze test results and and prepare test reports,''
Pryor said.
   TRW Inc. and Science Applications International Corp. or SAIC
have been hired under an $85 million contract to provide a wide
variety of technical support `` across the full spectrum of test and
evaluation activity,'' the report said.
   TRW is the 11th largest weapons supplier to the Pentagon and the
fourth largest contractor working on the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the report noted.
   The testing office insists that its staff is making all the
decisions and the firms are merely providing support, but the report
said TRW has ``contact with a wide variety of other DoD projects and
contractors ... (and) it is difficult to understand how this firm
can be used to perform objective, independent operational testing.''
   At the Cleveland headquarters of TRW, the firm's media relations
office said everyone who could comment was traveling.
   Frank C. Conahan, assistant comptroller general in the General
Accounting Office, told the panel that ``testing has not been
comprehensive, realistic or rigorous; nor has there been sufficient
oversight of the testing and evaluation function by top management''
of the Defense Department.
   To improve testing, Conahan said officials in his agency
``strongly support the need for having some ... results available
early in the acquisition process before production commitments are
made.''
   John E. Krings, the head of the 50-person office who has
announced he is retiring, defended the testing operation, saying the
Pentagon ``has made tremendous strides'' to ensure that equipment
sent to the troops is safe and effective.
   He cited a number of cases in which organized tests have affected
weapons, but he said some weapons can't be ``subjected to full up
operational testing until a considerable monetary commitment has
been made.'' Congress has not always been forthcoming with the
money, he said.
   While he praised the goal of an independent testing office,
Krings said, ``The price of independence is a constant attack from
those who would leave you independent from all but them.''

<HEAD>Papandreou Ends Electoral Campaign With Giant Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou ended his
election campaign with a giant rally Friday, urging 500,000
supporters to give his Socialist Party another term to complete
reforms begun eight years ago.
   Recent opinion polls have indicated, however, that the
conservative New Democracy Party will get about 47 percent of the
vote in Sunday's election, compared with 36 percent for the
Socialists.
   The Supreme Court said 25 parties are participating, including
anarchists, fascists and the Coalition of the Left and Progress, a
new alliance of the Moscow-oriented Greek Communist Party and the
Greek Left party that is the country's the third-largest political
organization.
   If neither major party wins a majority in the 300-member
unicameral parliament, the Coalition could become a power broker.
Some polls give it 14 percent of the vote.
   Both New Democracy and the Socialists have said they would reject
Communist support in forming a government.
   Papandreou told the cheering crowd in Constitution Square the
Socialists need four more years to finish their tasks and prepare
``for the challenge in 1992,'' when Greece and the other 11 members
of the European Economic Community drop internal economic barriers
and become a single market.
   ``The four years leading to 1992 ... to a united Europe, compels
us to develop technology to a great degree,'' he said.
   People in the crowd waved flags of green, the party color, and
sang along with music blaring from giant loudspeakers before
Papandreou, 70, appeared on a platform in front of the Unknown
Soldiers Tomb.
   Approaching the platform, he was accompanied by his 35-year-old
mistress, former airline hostess Dimitra Liani. Papandreou said they
will marry soon.
   His divorce from his American-born wife Margaret became final
June 9, and on Friday their lawyers submitted the documents
necessary for the Greek Orthodox Church to end their 38-year
marriage.
   Fireworks exploded above the square and lit up the darkened
skies, giving the rally a carnival atmosphere. Papandreou shouted
into the microphone, but the noise of the crowd drowned most of his
speech.
   Departing from prepared remarks, the premier attacked New
Democracy and its leader, Constantine Mitsotakis.
   ``They cannot defeat us with their slander and mudslinging,'' he
said.
   The reference was to allegations that he and ranking members of
his party were involved in a $200 million embezzlement scandal at
the Bank of Crete.
   Papandreou has denied any wrongdoing, but at least eight
ministers in his adminstration have resigned, including Deputy
Premier Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas.
   New Democracy finished its campaign Thursday night in the same
square. No campaigning is permitted Saturday.

   Prosecutors trying to avoid a clash over
national secrets said Friday they will narrow the Iran-Contra
indictment against former National Security Adviser John Poindexter,
while Poindexter's lawyer said he'll try to force President Bush and
former President Reagan to testify.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler said the government's plan to
adjust but not drop a broad conspiracy charge ``doesn't make any
sense,'' but the judge said it depends on the specifics of the
prosecution motion, which won't be submitted until next week.
   Beckler said he wants to subpoena Reagan and Bush because
Poindexter ``had substantial contact with both of these individuals
throughout this offense as outlined in the indictment.''
   Associate independent counsel Christian Mixter told U.S. District
Court Judge Harold Greene that after the charges are narrowed
``there would be no reason to involve'' Bush and Reagan in the trial.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said the prosecution will seek
dismissal of theft and wire fraud charges, which deal with the
diversion of Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, and
portions of the broad conspiracy charge against Poindexter.
   Later in the day, Walsh filed a motion to dismiss the three
charges against arms dealer Richard V. Secord, who is scheduled to
be tried separately in November.
   In court papers, Walsh said he wished to avoid the same legal
fight over state secrets that loomed in the Poindexter case,
particularly because of the reluctance of federal agencies to give
Secord access to classified documents to prepare his defense.
   Secord is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuity
to former White House aide Oliver L. North by arranging to set up a
$200,000 Swiss bank account for his children and by financing
installation of a $13,800 security system outside North's suburban
Virginia home.
   He also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressional hearings
on the Iran-Contra affair.
   The move to drop the major Iran-Contra charges against Secord
foreshadows the ultimate dismissal of those counts against his
former business partner, Albert Hakim, who is also awaiting trial.
   After the Poindexter hearing, Walsh indicated outside the
courtroom that the government's motion would seek to preserve
portions of a wide-ranging conspiracy charge dealing with
obstruction of Congress. Thus, the government appears prepared to
scuttle the portion of the 38-page conspiracy count dealing with the
diversion of profits to the Contras.
   Walsh said he is trying to avoid the kind of protracted battle
over classified material that threatened to derail the prosecution
of North.
   North, a former Poindexter aide, was convicted of three felonies
in the Iran-Contra affair and faces sentencing next Friday.
   He tried unsuccessfully to require Reagan and Bush to testify at
his trial. U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed
subpoenas for both men. Gesell said that the trial record contained
no proof North received authorization from Reagan to engage in
illegal conduct, and that North failed to demonstrate that Bush, who
was Reagan's vice president, had any relevant information.
   However, Poindexter, unlike North, met daily with Reagan, and so
may have more solid legal grounds for asking the former president to
testify.
   Walsh said that if he attempts to prosecute the charges against
Poindexter in their entirety, Greene might rule that vast amounts of
now-classified material might be required at the trial.
   Objections by U.S. intelligence agencies to introducing such
material led to scuttling of the entire conspiracy charge as well as
the theft charge against North.
   Beckler expressed concern to Greene that Walsh isn't planning to
seek dismissal of the entire conspiracy charge against Poindexter.
   The lawyer suggested that Walsh ``thinks he may be solving''
problems but that his move ``doesn't make any sense.''
   Greene responded that if Walsh decides to drop 5 percent of the
conspiracy count, then ``we have a big problem'' concerning the use
of classified information. But if Walsh seeks dismissal of 95
percent of that count, there won't be a big problem, the judge added.
   The remaining four counts against Poindexter accuse him of
obstructing and making false statements to Congress in connection
with North's secret resupply operation for the Contras and a 1985
arms shipment to Iran.
   Greene didn't set a trial date but did say he wanted to avoid
November and December when Secord may go on trial.

that a tank of radioactive waste exploded at a nuclear weapons plant
nearly 32 years ago, showering particles over nearly 400 square
miles and forcing 10,000 people to evacuate.
   Before the Chernobyl power plant explosion on April 26, 1986,
Western specialists called the disaster in the southern Ural
Mountains the world's worst nuclear accident. A secret CIA file made
public in 1977 quoted Soviet sources as saying hundreds of people
were killed.
   The Western accounts said the explosion created a vast
radioactive wasteland one-third the land area of Rhode Island, or
about 400 square miles.
   Thirty rural villages vanished from Soviet maps, fishing was
banned in lakes, dams were built to contain radioactive waterways
and rivers were diverted with canals, according to the Western
accounts.
   But the official news agency Tass said Friday no casualities had
resulted. It quoted Boris Nikipelov, first deputy minister for
medium machine-building, as telling a news conference a ``chemical
explosion'' occurred in September 1957 near Kasli, about 870 miles
east of Moscow.
   A tank of radioactive waste exploded at a military plant where
atomic weapons were to be built, ``forming a radioactive trail 105
kilometers (65 miles) long and 8 to 9 kilometers (roughly five to 5{
miles) wide,'' said Nikipelov, whose ministry administers
military-related nuclear programs.
   Tass said 2 million curies of radioactive elements were released,
and ``more than 10,000 people were urgently evacuated from the
contaminated zone.'' In comparison, Tass noted that 50 million
curies of radiation were released in the Chernobyl explosion and
fire in which 31 people were killed.
   The 1979 accident at Three Mile Island power plant in
Pennsylvania released 14 curies, a measure of the amount of
radioactivty contained in a material.
   U.S. analysts have calculated that the Urals accident spewed out
more radiation than that produced by the U.S. atomic bombing of
Japan.
   The effects of the accident lasted for decades, Tass indicated.
It said economic activity resumed in the area only by 1978, and even
then only in 80 percent of the contaminated zone. The remaining
territory was turned into a reserve. Radiation returned to safe
levels in the area only by 1974, and lakes and other waterways
remain contaminated, Tass reported.
   Tass did not say when or where Nikipelov gave the news
conference, nor did it say which radioactive particles were released
or whether the atomic weapons plant is still operating.
   Some Western reports have said the accident happened at the
Soviet Union's first nuclear production facility, in Kyshtym, about
20 miles south of Kasli. The complex or a replacement is believed to
be still producing plutonium.
   Tass said the accident was kept secret so long in the Soviet
Union because it occurred at a military plant.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness,
has brought to light other disasters long hushed up. In April, a
Soviet magazine reported for the first time that an ICBM exploded in
1960, killing the chief of Soviet rocket forces and incinerating
many other people.
   Tass said disclosure about the 1957 accident ``poured oil onto
the fire'' of a debate about building an atomic power plant in the
southern Urals. Nikipelov defended the plant's construction,
claiming it would help purify water contaminated by radiation by
evaporating it.
   Since Chernobyl, Soviet public opinion has turned against
harnessing the atom for electricity. Several nuclear power projects
were canceled because of protests.
   The Urals accident was first disclosed in 1972, when Zhores
Medvedev, a Soviet biochmist now living in Britain, wrote that
hundreds of people probably died of radioactive poisoning after
nuclear wastes near the first Soviet atomic power plants exploded.
   Lev Tumerman, a physicist who emigrated to Israel, said in a 1976
interview that he visited the area in the early 1960s and found it
was ``empty land,'' almost like a lunar view.
   CIA documents say another nuclear accident, an explosion,
occurred at Kyshtym in 1960 or 1961.

   President Bush on Friday declared federal
disaster status for the state of Louisiana as a result of major
storms and tornadoes that hit the southern part of the state last
week.
   Included in the disaster declaration were the parishes of East
and West Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston, St. Helena and Vernon.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is continuing to review
the damage and include some other affected parishes, the White House
said.
   Federal disaster status allows for federal aid, including
temporary housing and grants to affected individuals, and loans to
businesses.

<HEAD>Democratic Chairman Asks Ethics Code Meeting With Atwater</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party chief Ronald Brown
called on Republican counterpart Lee Atwater on Friday to join him
in writing an ethics code to steer politicians away from dirty
campaigning.
   Atwater said Brown should join him in supporting a proposal
President Bush will soon send to Congress.
   ``American politics is in trouble,'' said Brown, who was
attending the Association of Democratic Chairs summer meeting.
``Voters are sick and tired of attacks, dirty tricks, phony phone
banks and rumor mongers.''
   Brown said he sent an invitation to Atwater asking for a meeting
as soon as possible.
   ``I believe the two major parties can make a difference by
setting new standards of conduct in the profession of politics,'' he
said.
   Atwater, in a statement issued in Washington, did not refer
directly to Brown's call for a campaign code but said he would
consider meeting with him if the Democratic chairman endorsed a
campaign reform proposal Bush is preparing to send to Congress.
   ``The best thing Ron Brown and I can do is to work with our
respective congressional delegations for quick passage of this
legislation,'' Atwater said. Democrats, however, are working on a
campaign reform package of their own.
   Atwater also said he would like any such meeting with Brown to
include discussion of rules for congressional redistricting to take
place following the 1990 census. Both parties are spending heavily
trying to gain control of legislatures that will redraw
congressional districts in states that lose or gain seats in
Congress because of population shifts.
   The indirect exchange between the party chairman came a week
after Brown called for Atwater's resignation because of a Republican
National Committee memo attacking new House Speaker Thomas S. Foley.
   The memo compared Foley's record with that of Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass., who is homosexual.
   Mark Goodin, who sent the memo, resigned as RNC communications
director and said Atwater did not see the document in advance of its
distribution.
   On Friday, Brown stood by his suggestion that Atwater resign but
said he also believed it important for the party chairmen to discuss
campaign conduct.
   Brown also said, ``President Bush has to step up and lead his
troops. His troops are out of control. The Republican Party
leadership has become the princes of dirty politics, dirty practices
and negative campaigning.''
   He declined to say exactly which issues should be addressed in
his proposed campaign code but said a non-partisan group probably
would be needed to enforce any such guidelines.

   President Bush announced Friday his intention
to name two assistant secretaries of defense, attorney Stephen John
Hadley for international security policy, and Henry S. Rowen for
international security affairs.
   Rowen, succeeding Richard Armitage, is a professor of public
policy studies at Stanford University.
   A member of the Defense Science Board, he was chairman of the
CIA's National Intelligence Council from 1981 to 1983, and
previously was president of the RAND Corp., and an assistant budget
director. He was assistant secretary of defense under President
Kennedy.
   Hadley, succeeding Ronald Lehman II, is a Washington lawyer who
was a National Security Council staff member from 1974 to 1977, and
previously worked for the comptroller in the Pentagon.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Stops Some Drug Checks at Energy Department</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge enjoined the Energy Department
on Friday from randomly checking 24 drivers and computer specialists
for drug use, ruling the tests would be an unwarranted invasion of
privacy.
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt issued a preliminary injunction
barring the Energy Department from beginning the random drug testing
program on Monday.
   But Pratt upheld the agency's plan to proceed Monday with the
testing of employees suspected of using illegal drugs.
   ``Such testing shall be based on reasonable, articulable and
individualized suspicion that a specific employee may be under the
influence of drugs while on duty,'' Pratt said.
   Pratt issued the injunction in a lawsuit brought by the National
Treasury Employees Union, which represents 2,200 Energy Department
employees at the agency's Washington headquarters.
   Pratt rejected the government's contention that because the
drivers and computer specialists handled classified documents they
held sensitive positions that would subject them to random drug
testing.
   The judge noted that these employees ``have never been subjected
to ongoing security checks or strict job controls once their
security clearance has been determined.''
   ``They are not required to routinely disclose information
concerning their medical or financial circumstances and are not
required to undergo routine physical examinations for work,'' Pratt
said.
   Pratt also noted a ``complete absence of any history of
drug-related accidents, safety violations or a single incident of
blackmail or bribery involving employees in these positions.''
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said government
attorneys are ``reviewing the opinion and studying our options.''
   The lawsuit is one of a series brought by various employee
organizations following then-President Reagan's ``drug-free
workplace'' initiative.
   Federal court orders enjoining random drug testing of Justice
Department attorneys and civilian Army employees are being reviewed
by a federal appeals court here.

   Moving to put his own mark on the Oval Office,
President Bush is putting aside a presidential desk that dates back
to Rutherford B. Hayes.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ordered his own desk
installed in the Oval Office on June 13.
   ``He had it as vice president, and he got used to it, found it
comfortable, thought it was attractive,'' Fitzwater sid, elaborating
on Bush's new work station.
   Bush's desk was one of four made-to-order about 1920 for the
owners of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co. It was placed in the
company's office in Ohio.
   Later, the CSX Corp., parent company of the C&amp;O Railway donated
the desk to the White House. After his inauguration, Bush used the
desk in his private residential quarters.
   Fitzwater said the desk replaces the one ``used there by
Presidents Kennedy, Carter and Reagan.'' The old desk has been
returned to White House storage.
   The old desk is known as the ``Resolute'' desk because it was
made from timbers of the HMS Resolute and was given to President
Hayes by Queen Victoria. It was used by every president from Hayes
to Kennedy, then was in the Kennedy Library traveling exhibit and
then in the Smithsonian until President Carter brought it back to
the White House.
   Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Ford used desks from Capitol Hill.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
$1.13 million in civil penalties against Dow Chemical Co. Friday
because the company allegedly failed to promptly inform the agency
it was manufacturing a new chemical substance.
   Such notification is required under federal toxic substances
control laws. The law provides a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for
each day the notification provision is violated.
   The EPA said Dow, based in Midland, Mich., accumulated 227
separate violations because of the reporting lapses involving the
new chemical product, a clear plastic called polycarbonate.
   The company has 20 days to request a formal hearing on the
proposed penalties.
   Bill Donberg, Dow's business director for polycarbonates, said
the product has been manufactured by Dow in Freeport, Texas, since
1985. He said Dow determined no EPA notification was required
because some of the chemicals used in the product already were on
the EPA's list of toxic substances.
   Donberg said the company gave the EPA notification in 1987.
   ``What we're going to have to do is explore with the EPA to see
whether or not we did actually commit this violation and if we did,
what the appropriate penalty would be,'' Donberg said.

<HEAD>Bush Sends Negotiators To Reopen Arms Talks With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided against major shifts
in the U.S. negotiating position when talks resume next week with
the Soviet Union to reduce long-range nuclear weapons arsenals by up
to 50 percent.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday there would be
only ``relatively minor changes'' from the stand the Reagan
administration took at the bargaining table in Geneva before
negotiations were suspended seven months ago.
   ``The previous administration left an excellent foundation on
which to build,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush convened a meeting of the National Security Council on
Thursday before formulating instructions to Richard Burt and Henry
Cooper, who head the U.S. delegation for the strategic arms
reduction and space-defense talks.
   Among the items the president took up with his key advisers was
whether to shift the U.S. position on mobile missiles.
   The chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services committees,
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., wanted to push for
a ban on mobiles with multiple warheads.
   The U.S. position in the talks last year was that all mobile
missiles should be outlawed until ways are found to keep track of
them and make sure any negotiated reductions are carried out.
   Fitzwater said that remained the U.S. position in the
negotiations with the Soviets. But he stressed that on mobile
missiles and other weapons questions, ``we do reserve the right to
review these matters and make changes on an ongoing basis.''
   Overall, the spokesman said, `'there will be a considerable
degree of continuity in the approach of this administration.''
   While the talks formally reopen on Monday, negotiations do not
begin until Wednesday. That leaves time for Bush to make changes in
the instructions he gave to Burt and Cooper.
   But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
did not expect the president to revise the U.S. position in the days
ahead.
   The talks are aimed at reducing U.S. and Soviet long-range
bombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to
50 percent.
   Earlier, a senior administration official also said the Bush team
is taking an optimistic view about the Kremlin's approach to the
negotiations.
   The official said the Soviets ``have indicated in their rhetoric
... they are eager to get back to talks and that they have a
positive attitude. We'll see.''
   When the negotiations were suspended last November, about 90
percent of the work was completed. The talks have been on hold ever
since as Bush took office and ordered a review of U.S. policy on
national security issues.
   The unfinished 10 percent of the agreement contains some of the
thorniest issues, such as weapons ceilings, limits on air- and
sea-launched cruise missiles, verification, and how to deal with
mobile missiles.
   A senior Pentagon official told reporters that U.S. negotiators
would seek to turn the talks immediately to verification issues.
   ``Intead of treating verification as the caboose on the train,
and treating it at the end or after the end, during ratification
debates, I think that we will probably see an effort to bring that
to a higher priority and get serious movement going on things that
could substantially advance our ability to verify this agreement
when it is done,'' said the official, speaking on condition that he
not be further identified.
   The Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty, ratified by the Senate
last year, drew complaints from some senators that it would be hard
to verify, although it allows unprecedented on-site inspection of
Soviet and U.S. military sites.
   Of particular concern under the proposed START treaty, said the
official, was the ability of the United States to verify the number
of Soviet mobile missiles. The Soviets have fielded two such
systems, the SS-24 and the SS-25, whereas the United States has not
yet developed one.
   Bush has asked Congress to provide money for two mobile missiles,
a rail-based MX, with 10 warheads, and the so-called Midgetman, with
one or two warheads.
   ``Whether under START it's going to be more desirable to permit
mobiles or to continue to seek the ban on them is something that we
may not be able to determine'' until the verification issue is
settled, said the official.
   When the arms talks resume, parallel talks will begin again on
space-based defenses against ballistic missile attacks.
   Both the senior officials who spoke to reporters said Bush ``has
indicated he is not going to make a 90-degree change in direction.''

<TEXT>
   Governing parties in the 12 EEC nations
will lose ground in the European Parliament if results in seven
member states that vote Sunday match those of the five that voted
Thursday.
   Unofficial projections of Thursday's ballotting in Britain,
Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland showed gains for
opposition candidates, with conservative parties often the main
losers.
   The European Economic Community (Common Market) nations to vote
Sunday on the 518-seat European Parliament are Belgium, Luxembourg,
Greece, Portugal, West Germany, Italy and France.
   Official results from Thursday's balloting will not be released
until voting has been completed Sunday. Exit polls and other surveys
indicated this voter swing Thursday:
   Britain _ The opposition Labor Party trounced Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party which has been in power for a
decade.
   A British Broadcasting Corp. poll gave Labor 51 of the 78 seats
allotted to Britain and the Conservatives 26. Labor had held 32 and
the Conservatives 45.
   Spain _ Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist Party will
lose 2 of its 28 seats in the Parliament. Spain has 60 seats. The
conservative Popular Party also lost 2 seats, dropping to 15, as did
the centrist Democratic Social Center losing 2 and holding 5.
   A Communist-led coalition won 4 seats, 1 more than it had.
Several other parties made slight gains.
   Denmark _ Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's Conservatives may lose
2 of its 4 seats with the Socialists going from 3 to 5 seats.
Denmark is allotted 16 seats in the Parliament in Strasbourg,
France. The People's Movement Against the EEC, which wants a
referendum on Denmark's membership, lost at least 1 of its 4 seats,
according to the polls. Other seats were scattered among various
parties and coalitions.
   The Netherlands _ Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and his Christian
Democrats gained 1 seat for a total of 9 but their conservative
coalition partners lost 2 of their 5 seats and the Socialists held
all 9 seats.
   Ireland _ It has 15 seats in the Parliament but the ballots are
not be counted until Sunday and the news media did not carry
predictions.
   Polls indicated that when all of the elections are complete the
Socialists, with 166 seats, will strengthen their dominant position.
The centrist Christian Democrats hold 112 seats and also were
expected to gain.
   Green and environmental parties, with 20 seats, also should do
well, especially in West Germany and France.
   Conservative parties were expected to suffer the losses.
   Thursday's turnout generally was low, though turnouts for the
European Parliament usually are.
   It was 35 percent in Britain, compared to 32.5 percent in 1984;
the Netherlands 48 percent, down from 51 percent five years ago;
Denmark dropped to 46 percent from 52.4 percent in 1984, and Spain
recorded 65 percent compared to 69 percent in 1987 when elections
were held there and in Portugal. The two nations joined the EEC in
1986.
   Polls have consistently shown that the Parliament's role in EEC
affairs is largely unknown to most of the people in the 12 nations.
   As a result, the election campaigns are dominated by national
rather than pan-European issues.
   The Parliament meets one week per month in Strasbourg.

<HEAD>Staff Overruled in Puerto Rico Grant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials in the Reagan administration's
Department of Housing and Urban Development overruled staff
objections and awarded a $268,000 grant to a company run by
Republican fundraiser Frederick Bush, The Wall Street Journal said
Friday.
   Bush &amp; Co. did no work on the project, an economic development
plan for in Puerto Rico, but took a portion of the grant money after
subcontracting the technical work for $125,000, according to HUD
records obtained by the newspaper.
   Bush was deputy finance chairman for then-Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign last year and is now the
administration's nominee for ambassador to Luxembourg. He is no
relation to President Bush.
   A HUD official said Friday the details of the Journal story were
``absolutely correct'' and that the grant out of the housing
secretary's discretionary fund went to Frederick Bush despite staff
findings that Bush &amp; Co. was not qualified.
   ``It shouldn't have been done that way,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``That's what the staff is for.''
   The official said he did not know if the technical assistance
grant to Bush &amp; Co. is one of the many now under review by the
Justice Department, which is examining the spending of federal
housing funds in a growing scandal of alleged influence-peddling in
HUD.
   Paul Adams, HUD's inspector general, told a congressional panel
Friday that he found developers who hired prominent Republicans as
consultants, including former Interior Secretary James Watt, were
able to land housing redevelopment funds from the department.
   According to the HUD official who spoke to The Associated Press,
then-HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce in 1986 had removed himself from
decision-making in the awarding of discretionary funds for technical
assistance grants such as the one Bush &amp; Co. was given.
   Former senior officials Deborah Gore Dean and Dubois Gilliam were
among those that approved the projects, the official said.
   Ms. Dean, one of the senior advisers to Pierce who controlled the
discretionary funds, told the newspaper in April, ``I didn't get
(Bush) the grant. When they came in and applied for it, they were
able to convince the people downstairs it was a decent grant to do.''
   Gilliam pleaded guilty earlier this year to accepting illegal
gratuities from a principal of a company that received a HUD Urban
Development Action Grant.

<TEXT>
   A Communist Party spokesman on Friday said
the party will need to institute reform to overcome its stinging
defeats in democratic parliamentary elections earlier this month.
   His pledge followed a party pep talk given by Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, himself a loser in the June 4 elections.
Rakowski analyzed the losses in preparation for the second round of
voting Sunday.
   Jan Bisztyga, spokesman for the Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, told a news conference: ``We are aware that
increased social support for the party in the future, especially
support by youth, must be linked with further democratization of the
system and economic reforms.''
   In other developments Friday:
   _A small band of young protesters shouting anti-Soviet slogans
from the steps of a Warsaw church hurled gasoline-filled bottles
toward police, who detained several before the demonstration
dispersed without further incident and apparently without injuries.
   _President Francois Mitterrand of France called Poland's
Communist leaders courageous patriots for their recent steps toward
democracy and reiterated a promise of economic aid as he ended a
three-day state visit.
   Rakowski acknowledged in a televised speech to Wroclaw party
members Thursday night that the party underestimated the vigor of
the Solidarity-led opposition's campaign and was too slow to shed
Stalinism in favor of reform.
   The speech followed intensive consultations within the party
leadership and the rank-and-file members after the setback suffered
in the June 4 elections, the most democratic in Eastern Europe since
World War II.
   ``Counting on favorable results in the first round of the
elections proved to be a mistake,'' he said. ``Could this have been
avoided? In part yes, if we would have noticed the threatening
dangers, but we did not notice them.''
   Sunday's runoff is for candidates who failed to receive
majorities on June 4. Most of the races will be for seats reserved
for the Communist Party or its allies in the Sejm, or parliament.
   Candidates of the independent Solidarity movement won all but one
of the 161 seats open to the opposition in the 460-member
parliament. They won 92 of the 100 seats in the new, freely elected
Senate, with the remaining eight to be decided Sunday.
   Only three party coalition Sejm candidates _ reformers supported
by Solidarity activists in their regions _ won first-round
victories. And 33 of the 35 top government officials on a ``national
list'' of unopposed Sejm candidates did not receive the required 50
percent of votes cast.
   The defeated Rakowski says he will not run again for parliament
Sunday under a plan worked out with the opposition to fill the 33
seats and maintain an agreed-upon 65 percent Sejm majority for the
Communist coalition.
   However, he left open the possibility of continuing as prime
minister, which is possible under Polish law.
   The new government and possible changes in party leadership are
expected to be the main topic at a party plenum this month. The
party is expected to confirm Gen. Wojceich Jaruzelski as its
candidate for president, a new post to be filled by the vote of the
Senate and the Sejm.
   The president is to name the new prime minister.
   The plenum will ``deeply'' analyze the electoral defeat, Rakowski
said.
   Rakowski said public dissatisfaction with the government and
living conditions ``has made many Poles judge us one-sidedly and to
pin exaggerated hopes on the opposition.''
   He said the ``aggressiveness'' of the opposition's campaign took
many party leaders by surprise, according to a translation provided
by the state-run PAP news agency.

<HEAD>Eds: 5 grafs SUB for final 4 grafs, 16-19, A cease-fire ... UPDATING
with Lebanese U.N. protest, New Israeli air raid.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gen. Michel Aoun said Friday his Christian
troops will attack Syrian supply routes in retaliation for the
shelling of a tanker carrying gasoline destined for Lebanon's
besieged Christian enclave.
   Syrian artillery fire set the tanker ablaze Thursday evening as
it approached the Christian port of Tabarja, 15 miles north of
Beirut.
   ``Roads leading to capitals of occupation (forces) will not be
safe henceforth,'' Aoun said in a statement broadcast by government
radio. ``We shall confront this foreign enemy with the courage of a
warrior at the front.''
   Syria's 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon receive supplies over a
network of roads from Damascus, the Syrian capital about 50 miles
east of Beirut.
   Attacks on the roads would be a dramatic escalation of the
3-month-old confrontation between Aoun's forces and a Moslem
alliance of the Syrians and Druse militiamen, which has largely
consisted of artillery duels.
   At least 372 people have been killed and 1,450 wounded since the
fighting began March 8, two days after Aoun's Christian army units
blockaded illegal ports operated by Moslem militias.
   The general describes the Syrians as an occupation force and has
declared a ``war of liberation.'' President Hafez Assad of Syria has
had soldiers in Lebanon since 1976, the year after the Lebanese
civil war began, under a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Christian gunners have shelled the supply routes several times in
recent weeks, mainly in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of east
Lebanon. Aoun did not say what other methods of attack he might use,
but commando raids, land mines and car bombs are among the
possibilities.
   Syrian forces have blockaded the 310-square-mile enclave where 1
million Christians live since the early days of the confrontation,
and shell the Christian-held coast north of Beirut to stop supplies
arriving by sea.
   Aoun's gunboats tried in vain to salvage some of the 660,000
gallons of gasoline from the tanker. The vessel still was burning on
Friday.
   Gunboats rescued 13 of the 14 crew members after they abandoned
ship and the other man is missing and presumed dead, police reported.
   Syrian shellfire destroyed fuel depots in the Christian enclave
March 30, creating a fuel shortage that has grown more acute.
   Dozens of small cargo ships carrying supplies and weapons
provided by Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, have reached Christian
ports successfully but others either have been hit by Syrian fire or
turned back because of it.
   The tanker was shelled several hours after three Lebanese cargo
vessels used to run food supplies to the Christians were blown up in
the port of Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Sidon is predominantly Sunni Moslem. The Sunnis have stayed out
of the fighting and merchants in Sidon have been shipping food to
the Christian ports by night.
   A cease-fire proclaimed by the Arab League in April has been
violated regularly.
   Lebanon's government and army have been split on sectarian lines
since a political crisis arose last September.
   At the United Nations in New York on Friday, Lebanon protested
Israeli air raids, even as Israel conducted another raid against a
Palestinian guerrilla base.
   Lebanon's permanent U.N. representative, Rachid Fakhoury,
protested a raid on Wednesday against Bshamun, southeast of Beirut,
in which he said several people were killed or wounded.
   Israeli warplanes Friday attacked targets at Rashidiyeh, Lebanon.
Police said two children were wounded in a house near the beachside
guerrilla base of Palestinian terrorist leader Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council.

<HEAD>Justice Department Objects To 48 Georgia Judgeships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department, exercising its
authority under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, objected Friday to
state legislation creating two judicial circuits and 48 Superior
Court judgeships in Georgia.
   The objection renders the judgeships ``null and void,'' said
Kathleen Wilde, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney. An ACLU
lawsuit challenging Georgia's method of election of all Superior
Court judges as racially discriminatory is pending in federal court.
   The Voting Rights Act requires that Georgia and other Southern
states submit all voting or election changes to the Justice
Department, which must determine that the changes have neither a
racially discriminatory purpose or effect before they can take
effect.
   The 48 judgeships covered by the department's objection Friday _
out of 137 total Superior Court judgeships in the state _ were
created since passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, Ms. Wilde
said
   Deborah Burstion-Wade, a spokeswoman for the civil rigts division
of the Justice Department, had no immediate comment on the
department's action.
   But Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers said he had been
notified of the department's objection and was studying it.
   ``I'm not sure what this means,'' he said.
   Ms. Wilde said the Justice Department's objection was based on
Bower's refusal to provide the department with requested information
on the racial makeup of the new judicial districts.
   The lawsuit pending in Brunswick challenges the at-large method
Georgia uses to elect Superior Court judges. In an at-large
election, two or more judges are chosen by the voters of an entire
jurisdiction created by the state.

   The Bush administration has granted refuge to
at least two more Chinese diplomats based in the United States,
State Department sources said Friday.
   Earlier this week, two diplomats in San Francisco announced they
intended to defect.
   Confirmation of the action came as nearly 100 more people were
arrested in China for taking part in pro-democracy protests and
China's leaders increased efforts to absolve the government in the
deaths of protesters.
   Also, the U.S. action occurred as Secretary of State James A.
Baker III worked to resolve a standoff with the Chinese over the
decision to shelter Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi in the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing.
   A State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that besides the two Chinese diplomats in San Francisco,
``there have been additional Chinese officials who have asked for
protection in the United States.''
   Any Chinese official who does seek to remain in the United States
will be allowed to do so, the official said.
   The official said the Chinese diplomats involved have not
formally asked for asylum, but could do so in the future.
   He refused to give a specific number who have sought refuge, nor
to confirm a report that a husband and wife, both diplomats in the
Chinese Embassy in Washington, were the diplomats in question.
   CBS News, quoting unidentified Chinese and diplomatic sources,
identified the two Friday night as Han Guohong, secretary to the
ambassador, and her husband Zhang Chiwei, an attache in the press
office at the embassy in Washington. There was no one available for
comment at the embassy Friday night.

<HEAD>Rains Soak the Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The rains that never came last year pelted the Southeast with a
vengeance as record storms soaked farmers' fields, washed out roads
and sent some people searching for higher ground Friday.
   Rivers driven up by as much as 14 feet forced officials to close
several highways throughout West Virginia and to evacuate the town
of Dunlow, with Red Cross workers kept out until late afternoon by
high waters.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon from the
Florida panhandle and northern Florida across Virginia and the
Maryland panhandle. Rainshowers and thunderstorms developed over
Montana and rain was scattered over northern Maine.
   Severe thunderstorm watches were posted over portions of Georgia,
Florida, North and South Carolina, eastern Virginia and Maryland,
the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey, eastern
Pennsylvania, southeast New York state, southwest Connecticut and
northern and central Florida. There were flood watches in parts of
Florida, Alabama and much of Georgia.
   In Montgomery, Ala., where 6 inches of rain fell in four days,
firefighters had to use a boat Friday to rescue a bed-ridden woman
and four children from a wood-frame house. The home, flooded
knee-deep in water, was located in a low-lying area.
   In Geneva County, Ala., authorities said several bridges washed
out along dirt roads, and one road was under water.
   A section of Mobile's Battleship Parkway was closed for about
three hours because of water over the road.
   Tree limbs downed by storms during the evening rush hour Friday
in Columbia, S.C., created havoc with traffic and knocked out power.
   During the morning, wind gusts toppled a tree onto a mobile home
at Kinsey, Ala. No injuries were reported.
   A tornado touched down south of Ashboro, N.C., early Friday
afternoon. There were no reports of injuries or major damage.
   Afternoon thunderstorms produced golf-ball size hail between the
North Carolina cities of Carthage, Vass, Pinehurst and West End.
   The nation's low Friday was 32 degrees at Redmond, Ore.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53 degrees at Houlton,
Maine, to 106 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif., and Phoenix, Ariz.
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to
extend from New England and New York state across Georgia, northern
Florida and the Florida panhandle, Upper Michigan and the northern
Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures were expected to reach the mid 60s over upper
Michigan and northwest Washington state, the 70s from northern and
western New England across the remainder of the Great Lakes,
Pennsylvania, the Ohio Valley and much of Tennessee, Wisconsin,
Northern Minnesota, the western portion of the Dakotas, the upper
Missouri Valley, the northern and central Rockies and the Pacific
Northwest. Highs in the 70s and 80s were forecast along the central
and southern Pacific Coast. Temperatures were expected in the 90s
over Florida, Oklahoma, southern Kansas and much of Texas with
temperatures reaching to 100 in New Mexico and other parts of the
Southwest. Highs over the inland portion of central and Southern
California also are expected in the 90s, going up to 110 across the
Desert Southwest.

   The State Department issued a travel alert
Friday to call attention to stepped-up anti-terrorist precautions at
Frankurt airport in West Germany and the conclusion of authorities
there that terrorist attacks ``cannot be ruled out.''
   The department did not advise travelers to avoid the airport,
believed by many investigators to have been the place where a bomb
was placed on the Pan American jetliner that exploded over Scotland
in December with 270 deaths.
   The alert quoted from a statement issued by German officials from
the state of Hesse, which said:
   ``Security measures at Frankfurt airport remain at a high level.
This is primarily due to the aggravated situation in the Arab
region. Terrorist actions, especially in the area of the Frankfurt
airport, cannot be ruled out. The security measures tie in with an
investigative proceeding against a terrorist organization which has
become active in the Frankfurt area.''
   In a similar announcement Tuesday, police in Frankfurt said they
were searching for Palestinian terrorists who might be planning
attacks in West Germany.
   Kurt Kraus, a Frankfurt police spokesman, said the search and
security alert was linked to ``recent activities of terror groups in
the Middle East'' and there appeared to be a connection with the
conviction of TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was sentenced to life in prison
after being convicted by a Frankfurt court in May on charges of air
piracy and murder in the 1985 TWA hijacking.
   A U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans were held for 17
days during the ordeal.
   Federal prosecutors have said they believe the suspected
terrorists to be members of a group called the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command.
   The Syrian-supported group has been mentioned as a prime suspect
in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Police raids last October uncovered weapons and explosives and 14
Palestinians were arrested. Warrants have since been issued for four
of the suspects.
   Kraus said police suspect other members of the group are still at
large in West Germany.

   About 7,500 people were evacuated from their
homes and businesses for about three hours Friday while authorities
burned nine cases of old dynamite found by a warehouse cleanup crew.
   The evacuees included 4,000 employees at Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber
Co. In addition, 150 residents of the Middlebury Manor nursing home
were taken to two high schools and hospitals, said police Capt.
David Whitmire.
   Workers at Guran Concrete &amp; Supply Co. found 450 sticks of
dynamite after prying off the lid of a container in a warehouse,
said fire Capt. John Robles. Authorities were alerted about 11 a.m.
   The evacuation was ordered about an hour later when the bomb crew
decided the best way to handle the dynamite was to slowly burn it in
a dirt bunker, Robles said.
   Elmer Guran, one of the company's owners, said the dynamite had
been in the warehouse for about 20 years but was not sure where it
came from.
   ``From what we can tell it was part of an acquisition of a
construction company that went bankrupt in 1969,'' said
   The dynamite was burned shortly after 3 p.m. Flames shot 15-20
feet high, but there was no explosion.
   Dan Testa, deputy fire chief, said the evacuation was necessary
because there was a small chance of an explosion.
   ``You hate to do some of the things necessary, but you are
dealing with people's lives,'' he said.
   The evacuation order took in a mostly industrial but partly
residential area within 2,000 feet of the dynamite. It also shut
down an Ohio Edison Co. substation, cutting power to 4,170
residential and business customers, said spokesman Bud Carter.
   In addition, natural gas service in the neighborhood was shut
off, officials said.
   ``Everything went amazingly well,'' said Sue Gregg, administrator
of the nursing home, although some of the patients didn't want to
go. When they got to the high school, they had lunch and a
singalong, she said.
   The evacuation was the second in Akron this year. About 2,000
residents were evacuated following a chemical train derailment Feb.
26.
   It also was the second time in Ohio since 1986 that residents had
to be evacuated because of dynamite.
   In October 1986, about 1,700 residents of Columbus' east side
were forced to flee their homes temporarily after employees of a
storage company found a dozen 50-pound cases of unstable dynamite in
a locker. Burning that dynamite without moving it caused about
$40,000 in damage.
   The owner of the Columbus dynamite, John G. Rieder of Kansas
City, Mo., was sentenced to six months in prison, fined $1,000 and
ordered to make restitution.

<HEAD>EPA Staff Recommends Ocean Dumping Permits, With Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The staff of the Environmental Protection
Agency recommended Friday that permits be issued to nine New York
City-area municipalities which dump treated sewage sludge in the
Atlantic Ocean.
   An EPA hearing officer said authorities should be allowed to
increase dumping sewage to five times their normal rates under bad
weather, up to 15,500 gallons per minute.
   The report also recommends creating two barge tracks inside the
dumping area, rather than the current single track, enabling more
barges to use the dump site simultaneously. The permits would also
reduce the time and distance that must remain between barges.
   ``I believe that these modifications ... while continuing to
provide for maximum protection of the marine environment, result in
a permit which is fully implementable,'' EPA hearing officer Richard
L. Caspe said in his report. ``I do not foresee any environmental
condition which would result in its impracticability or its lack of
environmental protection.''
   The permits, which would be valid until March 17, 1991, must be
approved by the EPA regional administrator, said Herman Phillips, an
agency spokesman in New York.
   Currently, New York City, Westchester and Nassau Counties, and
six sewerage authorities in New Jersey dump more than 8 million wet
tons of sewage sludge annually at a site 106 miles off the New
Jersey coast.
   They are the only municipalities in the United States that dump
sewage sludge in the ocean. The municipalities have been dumping
under a court order issued in 1981, but the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of
1988 makes such dumping illegal after Aug. 14, 1989 unless the
municipality has entered into an agreement with the EPA to phase out
the practice.

   The Justice Department objected Friday to
Georgia laws that created two judicial circuits and 48 elected
Superior Court judgeships over the past 24 years.
   The action was disclosed in a letter to state officials from
James P. Turner, an acting assistant attorney general in the civil
rights division. Under the 1965 Civil Rights Act, the objection
renders the laws legally unenforceable until the department's
objection is withdrawn or overturned in court.
   But Deborah Burstion-Wade, a spokeswoman for the civil rights
division, said the department's objection does not prevent the 48
sitting judges from continuing to fulfill their duties, nor does it
provide a basis for challenging their past decisions.
   The Voting Rights Act requires that Georgia and other Southern
states submit all voting or election changes to the Justice
Department, which must determine that the changes have neither a
racially discriminatory purpose nor effect before they can take
effect.
   The 48 judgeships covered by the department's objection Friday _
out of 137 total Superior Court judgeships in the state _ all were
created since passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   But the state of Georgia did not submit any of the 48 judgeships
to the Justice Department for approval until after a 1986 Supreme
Court ruling made it clear that the creation of elected judgeships
was an election change covered by the Voting Rights Act.
   Turner said in the letter that the department's objection was
based on the refusal of state officials to respond to requests for
additional information needed to determine if the new judgeships and
judicial circuits were free from racial discrimination.
   Turner said, however, that the department is ``ready and willing
to reconsider'' its objection if the state provides the requested
information on the racial makeup of the new judicial districts and
the General Assembly's rationale for creating them.
   Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers said he was studying
Turner's letter. ``I'm not sure what this means,'' he said.
   Kathleen Wilde, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose
lawsuit challenging Georgia's method of election of all Superior
Court judges as racially discriminatory is pending in U.S. District
Court in Brunswick, said the Justice Department action ``will
strengthen my hand.''

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey appeared to
fall short in his fifth attempt to achieve a majority for hs party
in parliamentary elections, state television said Saturday.
   The real surprises were the surge of the left, with gains for the
Labor Party and the Workers Party, and the collapse of the
center-right Progressive Democratic party, the electoral partner of
Fine Gael.
   Computer projections for the RTE network indicated that in
Thursday's election Haughey's Fianna Fail party won no more than 77
seats, a loss of three from its position when the Dail (parliament)
was dissolved in May.
   Ballot boxes were opened Friday morning, and by early Saturday
122 seats had been decided: Fianna Fail 55, Fine Gael 38, Labor
Party 12, Progressive Democrats 4, Workers Party 7, Democratic
Socialist 1, Green Party 1, independent and others 4.
   Roger Garland, the Green Party winner, was the first of his party
to win a seat in the Dail.
   If Haughey forms a coalition it would be the first time since
1969 that an Irish government won a second term.
   ``One of the disappointing things is that Irish politics may now
become polarized between right and left,'' said Des O'Malley, the
Progressive Democrat leader who won re-election. ``I think that
would be a great pity.''
   Fianna Fail's general secretary, Frank Wall, conceded that the
best his party could do would be 82 seats, one short of a majority.
   ``Mr. Haughey is now a five-time loser,'' Fine Gael party leader
Alan Dukes declared.
   Fianna Fail won 81 seats in 1987 and held 80 when the Dail was
dissolved. Fine Gael got 51 seats in 1987, Labor 12, the Progressive
Democrats 14, Workers Party 4 and others 4.
   Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan of Fianna Fail was the first
confirmed winner. He missed the campaign to undergo a liver
transplant at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., but easily held
his district in Dublin West.
   Haughey swept to a predictable victory in his own Dublin
constituency.
   In Ireland's complicated election system, a quota is set in each
constituency for the number of votes needed for election.
   Voters mark their ballots in order of preference, up to five
choices. If no candidate reaches the quota, the vote ``transfers''
to the voter's second choice, and so on.
   About 77 percent of the 2.4 million eligible voters turned out
Thursday in hot sunshine.
   Haughey, 63, has failed in four elections since 1979 to win a
majority, relying on the support of splinter groups and
independents. He called the latest election three years ahead of
schedule when his poll ratings were high and he sensed a chance for
a majority, but his ratings have dropped since.
   Despite his lack of a majority in the last parliament, Haughey
was able to implement a sweeping austerity program to ease the
country's debt and bring down interest rates.

<HEAD>Union Leader Says Salvadoran Police Tortured Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCOS ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union leader said Friday he
was tortured by police agents who held him captive for four days and
threatened to kill him if he reported the incident.
   Jose Tomas Mazariego, a leader of the National Unity of
Salvadoran Workers, said he was seized Monday after he left the U.S.
Embassy where he went to pick up a visa for a trip to the United
States. He was released Thursday night.
   A communique issued by the Treasury Police, an agency that deals
with security, confirmed Mazariego had been detained and said he
suffered slight injuries while resisting police who took him into
custody.
   Mazariego, who sought the visa after he was invited to the United
States to address several union meetings, gave this account of his
detainment in an interview with The Associated Press:
   After he left the embassy accompanied by a friend ``I noticed
they (police) followed me in two cars.
   ``Armed men with rifles and dressed in civilian clothing detained
me violently and fired at my companion, who tried to impede the
capture. ... They did not identify themselves and hit me when I
protested.''
   ``After they captured me they blindfolded my eyes and I stayed
that way the whole time. They put a hood on me and kicked me in the
knees and the feet.
   ``They wanted to apply electric shock, but the apparatus didn't
work and they kicked me again. I hurt all over.'' He showed the
bruises on his legs.
   He was not allowed to sleep and his captors ``tried to get me to
admit participation in attacks by urban guerrillas of the FMLN
(Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.'' The FMLN is a
coalition of leftist groups battling the U.S.-backed government.
   The Treasury Police communique said Mazariego was questioned
about belonging to a rebel organization and claimed he is a member
of the Armed Forces of Liberation. That group purportedly is a
branch of the Salvadoran Communist Party and one of the armed
organizations in the FMLN.
   The communique said Mazariego has been under investigation since
1987.
   Mazariego said that while he was being interrogated and beaten,
the police agents told him ``the former government was too slow and
with the arrival of (President Alfredo) Cristiani, they now have
complete license to finish with all the unions, which they called
facades for the FMLN.''
   Cristiani, leader of the conservative Nationalist Republican
Alliance, was installed in office June 1 after his party defeated
the incumbent Christian Democrats in the March elections.
   Mazariego said the police agents tried to link the National Unity
of Salvadoran Workers, El Salvador's largest labor organization,
with the FMLN and asked him about three union leaders, Humberto
Centeno, Marco Tulio Lima and Julio Cesar Portillo.
   He said the ``torturers'' told him Lima and Centeno ``should not
still be alive ... and when an opportune times, they (police) will
act.''
   Mazariego said when the blindfold was removed and he was freed
his captors told him he would be killed if he made any complaint.
   Denys Everingham of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of
America in Trenton, N.J., said Tuesday that Mazariego had been
scheduled to speak at a union meeting in Philadelphia on Thursday.
He also said Mazariego, an official of the Salvadoran
Telecommunications Union, had planned to attend a union meeting next
Monday in New Jersey.

   More than 20,000 coal miners in six
states stayed off the job Friday in an expanding wildcat strike that
one union official said was being directed by United Mine Workers
President Richard Trumka.
   Miners in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Virginia and Tennessee
joined the walkout, which began Monday in West Virginia in sympathy
with 1,600 miners on strike in Virginia and West Virginia against
The Pittston Coal Group.
   UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are
responsible for the wildcat strike, which the companies say violates
the 1988 national contract the union signed with the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association.
   In Pennsylvania, 2,300 miners were on strike, less than 14
percent of the state's total. UMW District 2 President Nick Molnar
said union officials planned to tell each of the district's 52 local
unions by telegram that their members should report to work as
usual. Molnar said he could not predict whether the miners would
obey.
   But in Birmingham, Ala., District 20 international executive
board member Tommy Buchanan said the final decision on whether
Alabama miners will join the strike will be with Trumka.
   ``It might be two days. It might be a week. It will start
whenever it comes down from the union president,'' Buchanan said.
   Buchanan said earlier there is a ``100 percent chance of a
sympathy strike'' by the district's 5,000 members.
   Trumka did not return telephone calls Friday. UMW spokesman Joe
Corcoran in Washington was not in his office and has not returned
phone calls this week.
   About 5,000 miners on Friday attended a rally in Ebensburg, Pa.,
near Johnstown. Meanwhile, in Hazleton, Pa., union officials
organized miners who could leave on short notice from Trumka to
picket in support of the Pittston strikers, said Bill Ray, District
25 president and an acting member of the union's international
executive board.
   The walkout has affected about two-thirds of West Virginia's
24,000 miners, industry officials estimated, including 2,500
Consolidation Coal Co. miners and 1,000 Island Creek Coal Co.
employees.
   Some non-union mines and coal-related businesses, including
barge-loading docks and power plants, also were hit by bands of
roving pickets.
   About 650 Westmoreland Coal Co. workers went back to work in
Virginia Friday, but about 790 Island Creek miners went on strike in
that state at the same time, company spokesmen said. Virginia has
about 12,000 miners.
   About 200 Consolidation miners at Arco, Tenn., joined the strike
on Friday, a company spokesman said.
   At least 1,390 workers were off the job Friday at seven Indiana
mines. UMW Local 5179 leaders ordered workers to return to their
jobs at Old Ben Coal Co.'s No. 1 mine near Spurgeon, Ind., during a
meeting Friday, but local president Jim Griffith said he was unsure
whether workers would obey the order. Company officials also refused
to comment.
   Lester Weist, chairman of the local's mine committee, said the
members were ordered back to work because the work stoppage violates
the contract.
   ``No local issues are involved,'' he said. ``The stoppage was not
initiated on the local level, and at this point we're unsure of what
level it was initiated.''
   He said union members on the midnight shift apparently received
phone calls that they were on strike until further notice.
   In Terre Haute, UMW District 11 spokesman Mark Arnold said the
CBS television program ``48 Hours,'' whose program Thursday night
focused on the Pittston strike, apparently sparked the Spurgeon
miners to walk off the job.
   About 290 miners at Peabody Holding Co.'s Camp No. 1 mine in
Morganfield, Ky., didn't report for work Friday, company spokesman
Tom Clarke said, but they represent less than 1 percent of the
state's 32,000 miners.
   The largest contingent of striking miners in Pennsylvania was at
the Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central
Pennsylvania, where 1,600 workers failed to show up, company
spokesman Hank Waneck said.
   The original strike by West Virginia and Virginia miners began in
April when Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators
Association to negotiate with the union independently. The two sides
have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.

   A 311{-pound man who hasn't made child
support payments for more than a year because he's too overweight to
work is under court order to lose 50 pounds or go to jail.
   Charles Petro has gained 85 pounds in the year since his doctor
told the Carbon County Court that obesity was making his patient's
back condition worse.
   Common Pleas Court President Judge John P. Lavelle found Petro in
contempt of court on June 9 because Petro had gained the weight in
the year since he first went before the judge for the same reason.
   ``I call it my `Oprah Winfrey sentence,''' Lavelle said Thursday.
``It's designed to make him lose weight for the benefit of his
children, while Oprah lost weight for the benefit of her job and
future security.''
   Lavelle set Sept. 9 as the deadline for Petro to shed 50 pounds
or go to jail for 90 days. To verify Petro's weight, the judge sent
him to a nearby medical center where he was weighed.
   ``I said to him, `No sacrifice should be too much for a man who
has a duty to support his children,'' Lavelle said. ``The only way
this man will ever get back to being a productive worker is if he
loses weight.''
   Petro, who has two children, could not be reached Friday for
comment.

   Israeli troops shot and killed three Arabs and
wounded at least 13 in clashes in Rafah in the Gaza Strip Friday,
and soldiers used rubber bullets and clubs to curb a riot outside a
Gaza prison, Arab reports said.
   The army said it was investigating events in the occupied
territory. It confirmed one death but said it had no information
about the other two.
   In the occupied West Bank town of Tulkarem, masked youths Friday
attacked a fellow Palestinian accused of collaborating with Israel,
stabbing him with a knife and firebombing his car, Israeli and
Palestinian news reports said.
   The army confirmed that Bassam Akhras, 26, was slightly wounded.
   The 18-month revolt against Israeli occupation has killed 520
Palestinians and 22 Israelis.
   Army Chief of Staff Dan Shomron said on Israel radio that Israel
has the military force to quell the uprising but will not resort to
extreme measures to end the violence.
   Israeli columnist Zeev Schiff wrote in the Haaretz daily on
Friday that right-wing politicians have pressured the army to adopt
more brutal measures and to treat Palestinians as ``bona fide enemy
soldiers.''
   The army so far has rejected the call, refusing to do the
politicians' ``dirty work,'' Schiff said.
   Troops in Rafah fatally wounded Valid Omar Abu Abed, 23, in the
abdomen and he died at Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, hospital
officials reported.
   The army confirmed the death, saying Abu Abed was shot during a
demonstration in which Palestinians hurled stones and metal bars at
soldiers.
   Arab reports said the death touched off riots at the crowded Idna
neighborhood and army reinforcements poured in.
   Palestinian reports and Israel radio said Amir Fuad Nasser, 25,
died of a gunshot wound to the head and 17-year-old Ahmed Abed Rabbo
Abu Oun was fatally shot in the head and abdomen, and that both were
immediately buried in Rafah.
   Officials at Nasser hospital said they treated at least 13 Arabs
with gunshot wounds, including two boys, aged 11 and 12, shot in the
legs.
   Four other Arabs were shot and wounded in clashes elsewhere in
Gaza and the West Bank, Arab doctors said.
   They said four more were struck with rubber bullets, including a
45-year-old Palestinian woman from Bethlehem who lost her right eye
and a 17-year-old youth struck in the head.
   The army said it was checking the reports.

<HEAD>Energy Department Undecided on Settlement After Losing Mock Trial</HEAD>

   The government lost a dry run of a $300 million
lawsuit brought by neighbors of a federal uranium processing plant
and now will have to decide whether to settle the case, an Energy
Department spokesman said Friday.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel used a non-binding,
hurry-up procedure called a summary trial to encourage a settlement.
The eight-member jury decided Thursday to recommend a $136 million
award to residents who claim they were hurt by contamination from
the Feed Materials Production Center in Fernald, 18 miles northwest
of Cincinnati.
   The jury ruled that National Lead of Ohio Inc. operated the plant
in a way that caused neighbors to suffer emotional distress and
lowered property values. National Lead, which operated the plant
from 1951 through 1985, was sued with parent company National Lead
Industries Inc.
   The Energy Department argued that the companies could not be
liable because they carried out the government's directions.
   Energy Department lawyer Henry Gill Jr. said the government would
pay any settlement of the case because of an indemnification clause
in its contract with the operator. If there is no settlement, the
case goes to actual trial Aug. 15 before Spiegel.
   In Washington, Energy Department spokesman Will Callicott said
officials would have to confer with Gill next week before responding
to a statement by Stanley Chesley, lawyer for the 14,000 plaintiffs,
that he would consider a settlement offer.
   ``We're going to have to assess what the most appropriate course
of action for us is,'' Callicott said.
   The department admitted in documents filed with the court that
the government sometimes told the operators to emphasize production
and not worry about environmental protection or regulations.
   The plant is one of several government nuclear weapons facilities
around the country whose safety has been challenged, prompting
expensive cleanups and interruptions in production.
   In Colorado, the Energy Department agreed with authorities Friday
to tighten federal monitoring of the Rocky Flats plant, where
investigators are looking for evidence of illegal waste dumping.
   Residents around Fernald said in their lawsuit that radioactive
contamination from the plant has polluted soil, air and water in
their environment, causing them mental stress and making their homes
undesirable.
   Tom Carpenter, a staff lawyer with the Washington-based
Government Accountability Project, a non-profit watchdog group, said
he thought the jury's verdict did not go far enough. Carpenter said
he investigated the plant for several years on behalf of disgruntled
workers and found negligence and inattention to worker health and
safety.
   ``They went too far at Fernald, definitely, and the lapse was
inexcusable,'' Carpenter said.
   The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty
exhaust-air filters since the plant opened. Government lawyers said
the material has not endangered residents or harmed property.
   Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio has operated the plant since
January 1986.

   The centrist Democratic Christian Party
denounced as repressive and unconstitutional on Friday a proposed
law by the new rightist administration to crack down on those who
disagree with it.
   The governing Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena,
has called the legislation a ``law in defense of the democratic
process.'' It proposes fines and prison sentences for those who
oppose the government or its policies, including journalists and
those who take part in protest marches.
   Christian Democratic leaders gave reporters a copy of the
proposed law, which executive committee member Ricardo Perdomo
called ``the preamble to total repression in El Salvador.''
   Fidel Chavez Mena, party secretary-general and one-time
presidential nominee, told a news conference the measure was
unconstitutional and would ``violate the most elemental guarantees
and individual rights.''
   Arena was scheduled to submit the bill for congressional approval
on Thursday but did not. Arena members did not explain at that time
why the legislation was not submitted and refused to discuss details
with reporters.
   El Salvador's new president is Arena member Alfredo Cristiani,
who assumed power June 1 from Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon
Duarte after winning big in March elections.
   Gloria Salguero Gross, a high-ranking Arena member and assembly
deputy, told reporters Thursday the assassination of Cabinet member
Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth on June 9 ``is a call to reflect and we
must give an answer within the constitution, within the arms of
democracy.''
   Arena holds a congressional majority.
   Arena officials and the military blamed the killing on the
Farabundo Marti Liberation Front guerrilla group, or FMLN. The
Marxist-led FMLN on Thursday issued a communique denying
responsibility. The guerrillas said the 73-year-old minister of the
presidency probably was shot on June 9 as a result of factional
fighting within the government.
   The FMLN has fought the U.S.-backed government for nine years.
   Perdomo said Friday, ``We are worried that a repressive law such
as this could in one given moment bite down on the social and
political forces of this country, taking away the space we have to
oppose and fight for the interests of the great majority.''
   The bill would establish fines for the FMLN and what the
government considers to be rebel-related groups that engage in armed
actions, sabotage, strikes or public demonstrations that ``clog
traffic on principal roadways, avenues or streets of the a city,
impeding the passage of people or vehicles.''
   The Christian Democrats pointed to one article they said denies
freedom of the press.
   It would makes it illegal for reporters to send outside the
country news or information ``destined to upset the constitutional
or legal order, the tranquility or security of the country, the
economic or monetary regimen.''
   The government will move against publishers and broadcasters
``who use in their journalistic pages or on radio and television
transmissions such news or information,'' the legislation says.
   The document says the legislation would augment a law already on
the books banning ``the existence of armed groups of a political,
labor union or religious character.''

   An Organization of American States
mission to Panama failed in its second attempt to persuade the
government and opposition to agree to hold negotiations on the
country's political crisis, officials said Thursday.
   Diego Cordovez, Ecuador's foreign minister and veteran U.N.
negotiator in the Afghan conflict, said ``it is necessary and
urgent'' that Panama's conflicting sectors open a dialogue.
   The conflict arose after the May 7 presidential election, which
was later nullified by the government. International observers said
opposition candidates won.
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the Defense Forces,
told the mission the military is unwilling to participate in
negotiations and that civilian government officials should hold the
discussions.
   The opposition insists Noriega and the military hold the real
power.
   The mission is scheduled to deliver a report on its findings at a
July 19 meeting of OAS foreign ministers.
   Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario Palencia said the commissioners
are willing to return to Panama ``when it is verified that a
dialogue is about to begin.''
   Two of the four ministers left Wednesday night. Cordovez went to
Peru and the OAS secretary general, Joao Baena Soarez, went back to
Washington. Palencia and Sahadeo Basdeo, foreign minister of
Trinidad and Tobago, returned home Thursday.
   Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida last
year on drug-trafficking charges, charges he denies. Then-President
Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire him, but Noriega orchestrated his
ouster.
   The United States has frozen more than $140 million in Panamanian
bank deposits and canal payments, hobbling the banking indsutry and
leaving the government ill-equipped to meet payrolls or fund basic
social programs.

   The administration is hailing the House version
of savings and loan bailout legislation as a major victory for
taxpayers after the resounding defeat of an attempt to weaken
President Bush's key reform proposal.
   Shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, the House capped a 13-hour
session by voting 320-97 to solve the worst financial crisis since
the Depression with the most expensive government bailout in
history. It will cost, according to the congressional General
Accounting Office, $285 billion over 30 years _ $157 billion of that
from taxpayers.
   The legislation also includes a series of what Bush has labeled
``never again'' provisions. In what the president identified as the
heart of his proposal, it requires S&amp;L owners to risk more of their
own money in a capital cushion between S&amp;L losses and the government
deposit insurance fund.
   ``The American taxpayers won a major victory today when the House
of Representatives voted for strong, tangible capital requirements
for the nation's savings and loans,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady said in a statement.

   The United States still can do business with
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping despite his military crackdown and the
massacre of hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people, a senior Bush
administration official says.
   The U.S. position as outlined Thursday by the senior
administration official went far beyond public pronouncements from
the White House or State Department.
   President Bush has been reluctant to affix blame for China's
bloodshed but has said it would be ``extraordinarily difficult'' for
the United States to have normal relations with officials
responsible for the massacre of students and workers participating
in pro-democracy protests.
   However, the administration official, a top policy maker in
Bush's inner circle, said U.S. ties with China involve ``a very
important relationship with a very important country.''

   CHICAG0 (AP) _ Kraft's efforts to appease winners in its botched
``Ready to Roll'' game aren't winning over everybody.
   ``I don't mean to sound greedy, but the settlement offer is kind
of skimpy and it's a far cry from what was being offered,'' says
Larry Bernstein, who matched game pieces for a $17,000 van.
   Bernstein was one of an estimated several hundred people who
matched game pieces for a Dodge Caravan in a contest designed to
have only one van winner. Kraft on Thursday offered those winners
$250 and a special drawing for four vans.
   ``I'm not really too pleased,'' he said. ``You're talking $17,000

   Skeptical Southern Baptists and Las Vegans sized

unlikely host to the passionate opponents of gambling and drinking.
   Stan Pritchett, a delegate to the Southern Baptist Convention,

opening on both sides of what has been called the meeting of the
high rollers and the Holy Rollers.
   The gathering for the nation's largest Protestant denomination
ended Thursday.
   ``They're nice, decent people; they even gave me a Bible,'' said
Capaldi as hundreds of Baptists passed out Bibles and imparted their
faith to tourists and residents. ``I don't think they can do much
about our image, or our thinking.''
   ``The people have been generally very friendly,'' said Pritchett

looks at a new gate. Generally the people have been very friendly.
The atmosphere here is like almost any place, except for the

   Scientists in Boston are learning to treat jet
lag, insomnia and other symptoms of a jangled body clock with
carefully controlled doses of ordinary light.
   Dr. Charles Czeisler and colleagues at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston reported today that they succeeded in
consistently resetting the body clocks of test subjects using timed
exposures to a light about as bright as the rising sun. Their
account of the experiments was published in Science magazine.
   Czeisler said the wake-rest cycles of the subjects could be moved
forward or back with ease, but the changes lack the precision needed
for a useful therapy for jet setters or for those with troubled
sleep.
   But, eventually, he said, the study will develop the techniques
needed to use light to change the body clock and relieve the wilting
weariness many feel when their life style is out of phase with the
sun.
   Czeisler said the research proved conclusively that light can
send a signal to the brain to reset the biological clock.

   Human rights groups claim
Israeli military courts that try Palestinians for such things as
throwing stones at soldiers are biased because both judges and
witnesses are army comrades.
   The groups also maintain that Israeli soldiers brought before the
same courts on charges of abusing Palestinians get proportionately
lighter sentences than the Arabs.
   The military rejects the claims.
   ``Palestinians throw stones often to kill. Soldiers act in
response to the violence,'' said Brig. Gen. Amnon Straschnow, head
of the military court system.
   He maintained the trials are fair. He said several hundred
Palestinians have been acquitted in stone-throwing cases, even when
soldiers identified the accused.
   ``We are conducting justice under fire,'' Straschnow said in an
interview. ``This may not be a classic war, but it is a kind of war.
But we try to balance this security problem which is unprecedented,
on the one hand, with the need to honor individudal rights.''
   One recent day in the military court in Ramallah, a 15-year-old
Palestinian, Munzer Zaatari, was convicted of throwing stones at
soldiers in the West Bank village of El Ram on May 9, although he
insisted he was in Jerusalem at the time.
   The military judge, Maj. Shlomo Isaacson, decided on the guilty
verdict even though a key witness, a soldier, contradicted his own
previously written statement about the location of the arrest.
   Isaacson sentenced Zaatari to 10 months in jail, although no one
was hurt in the stoning incident.
   ``These actions have turned into a plague on our country which
must be uprooted,'' the judge said.
   ``I didn't do anything,'' the jean-clad Zaatari shouted as a
soldier led him out of the courtroom.
   In an adjacent courtroom the same day, Maj. Jonathan Livni
acquitted Ibrahim Jaber, 18, of charges of throwing stones at
soldiers Nov. 16. He had been caught with a slingshot and a knife,
but Livni based his decision on the testimony of a soldier who said
he had recognized the stonethrowers from a distance of 150 yards.
   The trials were among dozens that are held daily to process most
of the 35,000 Arabs who, by official count, have been arrested since
the uprising began 18 months ago.
   Before the start of the rebellion, which has claimed the lives of
more than 500 Palestinians and 22 Israelis, the military courts
dealt mainly with cases involving armed attacks or terrorism.
   Today they are inundated with cases involving stonings, tire
burnings, flag raisings, demonstrations.
   More than 13,000 Palestinians have been tried since December
1987, when the uprising began, compared to about 1,000 the previous
year, according to army statistics.
   The average sentence has been a year in jail and a fine the
equivalent of $500. Many of those arrested are released before being
brought to trial and about 6 percent have been acquitted. Nearly
5,000 others are awaiting trial.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said 8,500 Palestinians are behind
bars for uprising-related offenses excluding 4,000 security
prisoners jailed earlier. He said the army intends to increase its
prison capacity to accommodate 1,500 more.
   Straschnow said the heavy caseload has forced him to double the
number of judges to six full time and 60 reservists on call.
   In April he also implemented a Supreme Court recommendation to
set up a new army appeals court to give Palestinians a second chance.
   ``It is an excellent example of the rule of law even in a
difficult period like this,'' Straschnow said.
   However, as in the case of Zaatari, Palestinian attorneys are
reluctant to appeal, fearing they will set a precedent that will
institutionalize harsh sentences for acts such as throwing stones.
   A human rights report by the U.S. State Department published in
January said ``acquittals are rare'' for Palestinians in Israeli
military courts.
   The civil rights group Al Haq, an Arab-run affiliate of the
International Commission of Jurists in Geneva, said, ``Evidence of
an Israeli soldier in military court is almost always believed in
preference to the detainees.''
   Another focus of criticism has been the wide use of so-called
administrative detention in which activists are jailed for up to six
months without trial. About 5,000 Arabs have been held without trial
during the course of the uprising; 1,508 currently are held in such
detention, according to the army.
   Straschnow said administrative detention was used only in serious
cases where evidence could not be submitted in open court to protect
the source, presumeably an informer or secret agent.
   ``We maintain the rules of standard and reasonable trial and due
process,'' Straschnow said. He noted that trials are public and
suspects are represented by lawyers.
   ``It's a hopeless case, this military system,'' said Osama Saadi,
Zaatari's Palestinian lawyer. ``It's arbitrary. The judges and
prosecutors are on the same side, so one side's story is usually
accepted more than the other,''
   Of 67 Israeli soldiers who have gone on military trial, 36 were
found guilty of misconduct, ranging from assault and battery to
causing death by unnecessary use of beatings or shootings.
   The heaviest sentence has been 21 months for causing death.
   An additional 400 soldiers have been disciplined by their
commanders with such punishments as loss of rank or position.

   Finding a new home isn't easy if you're
30 feet tall and weigh 50 tons. But if your name is Ramses the
Great, welcome mats come out all over.
   The question for Egyptian antiquities officials was which mat to
choose and they now have decided the proper thing would be to bring
Ramses back home from Cairo to this quiet village on the edge of the
desert, known in Ramses' time as Memphis.
   The rose granite colossus of the warrior Pharaoh Ramses II, who
reigned in 1292-1225 B.C., was taken from Mit Rahina in 1954 to a
platform in front of Cairo's bustling central railway depot on
orders of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had taken power in a coup two
years before.
   That decision proved a headache for the officials, however. They
worried that exhaust fumes from heavy motor vehicle traffic would
cause the statue to crumble and that the vibration from railroad and
subway trains beneath it would cause it to crack.
   In the late 1980s talk turned to saving it. One suggestion was to
move Ramses to the Giza Pyramids and another was to put him on an
artificial island in the Nile.
   In early June, however, a different course was decided.
   ``We decided to take him home, back where we got him,'' said
Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   When Ramses left Mit Rahina for the square renamed for him, Cairo
was a city of tree-lined boulevards. Today it's a megacity of 12
million people and growing.
   ``Poor Ramses,'' Egyptologist Gamal Mokhtar, a former chairman of
the antiquities organization, said in Cairo.
   ``He was brought here at the request of ... President Nasser, who
had overthrown the monarchy and wanted a symbol of ancient Egyptian
power. Nobody questioned it. You didn't at that time. Nobody thought
whether being in the city center was good for the statue. It isn't.''
   Nasser died in 1970.
   The statue has to be moved not only for its safety but also the
Pharaoh's dignity, Mokhtar said.
   ``Such statues never belonged in a public square,'' he said.
``They belonged in temples, facing the people, as a warning and
reminder of the Pharaoh's might.
   ``When you come into Cairo from the north, you see Ramses'
backside. That was never meant to be on public view. For one of
Egypt's greatest Pharaohs, this isn't proper.''
   Mit Rahina is a fitting place for Ramses. It is rimmed with date
palms and swaying halfa grass, which, when it was called Memphis,
brought fear and dread to adversaries throughout the ancient world.
Memphis was Egypt's first true capital and later its military
headquarters.
   Ramses II brought great power and wealth to Egypt. He built more
buildings and more colossal statues than any other Pharaoh.
   He had other capitals, but Ramses had special affection for
Memphis, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis is thought to have begun
life as no more than a tiny fortress beside the Nile, protected by a
white wall. In its heyday it stretched for miles and incorporated
military barracks, temples, palaces, shipyards, weapons factories
and craftshops.
   Its cemeteries extended for 50 miles and included the Giza
Plateau, home of the pyramids. Historians record that its Temple of
Ptah, the creator god and Memphis' patron, was a third of a mile
long and a quarter-mile wide and fronted by monumental statues of
Ramses.
   How many colossi of Ramses graced Memphis is not known, but
records say at least 15 were at the Ptah temple alone. A fallen
statue that would have stood about 45 feet, with fingernails the
size of hands, lies toppled on its back.
   A third colossus is the centerpiece of the Ramses exhibit now in
Dallas, Texas, at the end of a tour of the United States.
   Pieces of other statues lie among ancient Memphis' ruins, red
granite torsos and heads mingled haphazardly with weeds. Some are
covered with dirt for protection from village children, who use the
ruins for playgrounds.
   For part of the year the sacred texts, column bases and statues
are trapped in marshes, salty water rising as high as 6{ feet,
soaking and decaying all in its path.
   Tawfik said he believes the return of Ramses will mark a new
beginning for the ancient city.
   ``When visitors come to Mit Rahina, they stay only 30 minutes or
so, just enough to see the fallen Ramses and the monuments on
display,'' he said. ``We want to provide enough to keep them here
all day.''
   He said Memphis suffered because it was too important for too
long. Lived in for 1,700 years by Ramses' time, the city was built
largely of perishable mud-brick. Generations built on the fallen
mud-brick houses of their forbears so that ``what we have now are
ruins, not a complete city,'' Tawfik said.
   Except for the remnants of the once-magnificent temples, little
of old Memphis remains in Mit Rahina.
   ``The ancient Egyptian ... was mainly interested in the
netherworld, the afterlife. This is where he put his major
efforts,'' Tawfik said. ``This is why we have left so many examples
of monuments for eternity but not so many for life.''

   Last summer, viewers of ``Evening at Pops'' tapped
their feet to everything from Tchaikovsky to Stephen Sondheim, Simon
and Garfunkel to Irving Berlin, not to mention conductor John
Williams' scores for ``Star Trek,'' ``E.T., The Exterrestrial'' and
``Raiders of the Lost Ark.''
   After 20 years on PBS, the eclectic summertime perennial is one
of the longest-running and most-watched public television programs.
   ``I don't think its name is accidental,'' said Peter McGhee,
program manager for national productions at WGBH-TV, which produces
the series.
   ```Pops' is short for popular, right? It draws on a sort of
mainstream popular musical vernacular and it does so in a musically
intelligent way with people of great luster and accomplishment.''
   Beginning Friday _ check your local PBS station schedule _ PBS
will air a special 20th-anniversary ``Evening at Pops,'' taped at
Boston Symphony Hall, the home of the Pops.
   The concert kicking off the 12-week season features humorist Art
Buchwald, opera stars Robert Merrill and Roberta Peters,
comic-pianist Victor Borge and piano duo Anthony and Joseph Paratore.
   Williams took over as Pops conductor in 1980 after the death of
Arthur Fiedler.
   ``I don't think it's complacent to point out that the popularity
of the Pops does not seem to have diminished at all ... (but) we
have to keep up the search for a new repertoire, finding new things,
discarding things that no longer work,'' Williams said in a recent
interview.
   ``The Pops is famous for delivering a certain glowing, good
feeling that it must produce each and every time out. The amazing
thing is that it does.''
   McGhee suggested that the show is so popular because it is ``a
refuge from the violence and banality of the rest of television.''
   ``Evening at Pops,'' runs from June through August. Half the
60-minute concerts are new, the rest are repeats.
   The Pops was born 104 years ago when the Boston Symphony
performed its first ``Music Hall Promenade Concert.''
   The Pops' first program promised: ``The Programme for these
Concerts will be made up largely of light music of the best class.''
To draw summer crowds, the concerts offered electric lighting,
instead of the more stifling gas lights which drew oxygen from the
air, and cafe tables set up in a hall where alcoholic beverages
could be consumed, a move considered risky by staid Bostonians.
   The Boston Globe reviewed the inaugural concert on its front page
and declared, ``More than a `sea-change' has come over Music Hall.
The statue of Beethoven, which has witnessed many a strange sight,
looked out last evening on a summer garden scene as Teutonic as
though Boston were in (the) Fatherland.''
   Newspapers came to refer to the summer shows as ``popular
promenade concerts'' and from this came the truncated moniker
``pops.''
   In 1969, the orchestra took to the airwaves and has been there
ever since.
   Although under the baton of Williams since 1980, for many people
``Pops'' is synonymous with Arthur Fiedler.
   For 50 years, until his death in 1979 at age 84, the mustachioed
maestro conducted embroidered classics as well as lush renderings of
modern fare from Broadway, Tin Pan Alley and even Nashville. Elvis
Presley and the Beatles are among the composers whose works Fiedler
translated into Pops style.
   With his exuberant, almost baroque orchestration of well-known
songs and symphonies, Fiedler has been credited with placing the
Pops among the most recorded orchestras in the world.

   Elsewhere in television:
   WHOLE LOTTA TAPING GOING ON _ More than 2 million households
taped each of the final two parts of CBS' ``Lonesome Dove.'' They
were the top two most-taped programs in February 1989, according to
survey results just released by the Nielsen Media Research. Except
for NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and soap operas, VCR users mostly taped
television movies, according to Nielsen. ``The ABC Mystery Movie''
came in third on the top-10 list, followed by ``The CBS Sunday
Movie,'' the daytime NBC soap opera ``Days of Our Lives,'' ABC's
Sunday movies, ``L.A. Law,'' CBS' Tuesday movies, NBC's Sunday
movies, NBC's Monday movies, ABC's daytime drama ``All My Children''
and the repeat of the TV movie ``The Day After'' on ABC. Nielsen
said 66 percent of taping was of programs carried by network
affiliates. Independent station programs accounted for 13 percent of
the taping, 10 percent pay-cable, 7 percent cable and 4 percent PBS.

   Two years ago, the EPA tested a trout from the river and it had a
dioxin level of 90 parts per trillion, more than three times higher
than the consumption cutoff level recommended by the government.
Sludge taken from the river has tested as high as 260 parts per
trillion.
   ``If, after three years the company has met all of our
requirements, we will issue them a discharge release permit,''
Marlar said. ``Meanwhile, as long as they continue to operate
without a permit they are leaving themselves liable to possible
legal actions.''
   Blackwell estimated the compromise proposal would mean a 50
percent reduction of the mill's workforce over the next few years.
He said it will cost Champion about $300 million to install the
necessary technology.
   ``But,'' he added, ``it will allow us to remain in operation. So
we can live with this compromise if we have to.''
   Whether the people downstream can accept the three-year plan is
another matter.
   ``Something should be done, right away,'' Joe Hall said. ``It's
wrong to let a company destroy a beautiful river simply in the name
of profits.''

   When GIs came home after World War II,
the nation looked to the great forests of the Northwest for lumber
to build their houses.
   Oregon and Washington mills responded, and still supply more than
a third of the lumber and plywood used in the United States.
   ``There was always that one more shining hill covered with trees
to the west,'' said U.S. Forest Service budget officer Ron Johnson
in Portland. ``Now we find there's a Pacific Ocean and we fell into
it.''
   From the western slope of the Cascade Range to the shore of the
Pacific, this is the home of the Douglas fir, the towering king of
the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber.
   It is also home to the Northern spotted owl, a 14-inch bird that
could face extinction because, with rare exceptions, it won't nest
or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most
prized for timber.
   While logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the
national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl,
record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are
being shipped for premium prices to Japan, China and Korea without
ever seeing the inside of an American mill.
   ``If a log is of export quality, and is available to be exported,
it will be exported,'' said Tom Mayr, owner of the Mayr Brothers
mill in Hoquiam, Wash. Mayr has been reduced to counting his supply
in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being
loaded onto ships in Grays Harbor, Wash.
   ``We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent
years the highest value has been offshore,'' said Jack Taylor,
operations manager for Weyerhaeuser in Coos Bay, where the region's
leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce
metric-dimension lumber for the Japanese home-building market.
   Companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than
they can in the domestic market, said Forest Service economist Don
Flora in Seattle.
   Boom-and-bust cycles were known to the timber industry before the
spotted owl entered the spotlight, but for the first time the pinch
is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and
dips in the housing market.
   Eighteen years ago, Brad Wentworth stopped off in the coastal
town of Gold Beach to see some friends on his way to college to
study forest management. Now he's 37, a husband and father, and one
of the 300 workers at Gold Beach Plywood who will be out of a job
this summer when the mill shuts down.
   ``I got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages,''
Wentworth said. ``I kick myself in the butt now.''
   Thirteen other wood products mills in Oregon and Washington have
closed this year, putting nearly 2,000 people out of work as the
industry enters a new era of high-priced timber in short supply.
   ``The mill is old and inefficient,'' said Gold Beach mill manager
Eric Saunders. ``It would take about $3 million to bring it up. Why
should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a
stable supply of timber?''
   The shortage of timber doesn't come as a surprise, but its
magnitude does.
   In 1976, Oregon State University forestry professor John Beuter
reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that
the industry would have to depend on national forests, home to most
of the old-growth timber, to make it to the next century, when
second-growth trees planted before World War II would be ready for
harvest.
   Jerry Hamilton, director of resource services for Seattle's
Simpson Timber Co., had expected harvests in national forests to
decline about 20 percent in Oregon and Washington this year as the
Forest Service revised its long-range management plans. He now fears
it could drop 50 percent because old-growth forests have been ruled
off-limits because of the spotted owl.
   ``Historically, a lot of the impetus for the management of
federal lands in the West was to settle the West and develop it,''
said Beuter, now a consultant in Portland. ``We are sort of at the
end of that era now. We are at the point of recognizing that cutting
more timber isn't going to create new cities and new economic
opportunity in the West. In fact, we are coming around to where
saving the forests may create new economic opportunity.''
   Ed Whitelaw, a University of Oregon economics professor, has been
a leading proponent of the idea that the Northwest has more to gain
from preserving its blue skies, green forests and clear water than
from exploiting its resources.
   ``Most Oregonians receive two paychecks,'' he said. ``One is in
dollars. The other comes from the environment. By accounting for all
other amenities, I estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth
$1.3 billion. The paycheck from the timber industry is $1.5
billion.''
   In 1988, Oregon and Washington national forests supplied 5.4
billion board feet of timber, a third of the region's total harvest
from all lands. Where the Forest Service management plans used in
the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 5.5 billion board feet, the
limit in the 1990s will be closer to 4.7 billion.
   Unlike owners of private forests, the Forest Service by law may
cut no more timber than it can grow back. It also has to provide for
the needs of fish, wildlife, campers, hikers and water quality.
   Where it once had to answer only to the timber industry, the
service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder. The
governors of Washington and Oregon want to be sure there is enough
timber to sustain the rural economy. Environmental groups demand
preservation of old-growth forests. Academics have started offering
new management techniques that follow the lead of nature. And there
is new unrest inside the Forest Service.
   Jeff DeBonis, a Willamette National Forest timber sale planner,
has organized the Association of Forest Service Employees for
Environmental Ethics, with a mailing list of about 200. DeBonis
wrote in February to Forest Service chief Dale Robertson claiming
the agency is in bed with the industry.
   ``The question we need to ask concerned citizens is, `Why should
the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy
industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut?''' he
said.
   Robertson's staff is preparing a detailed response to DeBonis'
letter, said spokeswoman Rose Narlock in Washington, D.C. ``Maybe we
need some of these things talked about. It was a gutsy move on his
part.''
   Robertson has acknowledged that the Forest Service has taken a
beating in the courts under the National Environmental Policy Act,
evidence DeBonis cites for his argument that too many trees are
being cut.
   While loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more
timber, the grim truth is jobs are disappearing, spotted owl or no
spotted owl.
   ``The biggest source of change in employment has been the
modernization and automation of the forest products industry,'' said
Wilderness Society economist Jeffrey T. Olson, who produced a study
concluding the decline in timber jobs in the Northwest has little to
do with cutting old growth in national forests.
   Flora, the Forest Service economist, said in the 1970s he figured
each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber
jobs. That's now down to 1.5 jobs in the high-tech mills and four to
five jobs overall.
   Timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of
Portland and Seattle, but still vital in small cities and towns that
grew up with it.
   Oregon's 68,700 wood-products jobs _ almost all of them outside
the Portland area _ account for 5.2 percent of the state's
employment. Washington's 41,800 timber jobs account for 2.1 percent
of its employment. In 1986, the most recent figures available,
timber accounted for just 6 percent of Oregon's gross state product
at $2.5 billion and 2.2 percent of Washington's, at $1.6 billion.
   But Forest Service economist Con Schallau in Corvallis argues
timber has a greater impact than that, because it accounts for 38
percent of Oregon's basic economy _ bringing in outside dollars _
and 18 percent of Washington's.
   While economists may differ over timber's importance, they agree
the places that will be hurt worst are towns like Gold Beach,
population 1,500, with a payroll of $6 million from Gold Beach
Plywood.
   ``If you live in a big city you've got a lot of choices,''
Wentworth said, ``but if you live here you've got to work in the
brush or the mill.''

   One tip that Weyerhaeuser is taking bold
steps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard.
   Weyerhaeuser, a leading exporter of logs to Japan, has gone a
step further to produce precision-sawn, metric-dimension lumber for
Japanese home builders, for whom the appearance of wood for
traditional post-and-beam construction counts more than the
structural strength valued in the American market.
   ``We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent
years the highest value has been offshore,'' said operations manager
Jack Taylor.
   So the company scrapped an aging mill in North Bend on the
southern coast and converted a cedar plant here into its mill of the
'90s, called CBX.
   ``We're pulling out all the stops,'' said superintendent Sam
Dickey as he showed off the paved log yard, laser-guided saws,
flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork. ``We're
spending $1 million on the upgrade.''
   But high-tech also means fewer jobs. When Weyerhaeuser announced
the CBX project in January, North Bend employed about 200 and
produced about 65 million board feet a year, about 3 jobs per
million board feet. The CBX crew of 69 can produce 45 million board
feet a year, or 1.5 jobs per million feet.
   The mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry must
be extremely efficient, and Dickey expects his hand-picked crew to
lead the way. ``We're aiming to have this site be the model for the
industry.''
   To emphasize that point, Weyerhaeuser has installed catwalks for
visitors.
   ``All the major Japanese trading companies have been here once or
twice,'' said Dickey, who is learning Japanese.
   While Weyerhaeuser took the obvious steps of upgrading the
physical plant at CBX, it also is going where no sawmill has gone
before in its contract with the International Woodworkers of America.
   ``Basically, it lets people work as teams rather than in
individual job situations,'' said Milo Summerville, field
representative for IWA Local 3-261. ``Sometimes you have to give
something like this a trial period to see if it will work.''
   Lumber grader Al Esch is enthusiastic about being able to rotate
through three positions rather than sticking to one job. ``It's kind
of like being an immigrant in a new country,'' he said.
   Cheryl Howell, an 11-year veteran of the company, scored well on
a hand-eye coordination test, and was cross-trained to run
bark-stripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard. ``Before
it's done, I expect to know how to run everything in here,'' she
said.
   The first shift starts at 6:30 a.m., with workers and managers
joining in 10 minutes of exercises, followed by as much as 45
minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions. To
emphasize teamwork, Weyerhaeuser scrapped an old cleanup contract
and made everyone, including Dickey, responsible for keeping the
mill clean.
   Dickey is happy to get away from the old-style management
approach he calls ``big brain-little brain.''
   ``Generally you get dissatisfied employees because they are
starved for information,'' he said. ``We're giving them a big piece
of the operation.''

   In the rugged Illahe country where gold
miners still pan creeks running into the Rogue River, the Siskiyou
National Forest is trying techniques from a movement known as the
New Forestry.
   ``I see it as a major philosophical change rather than an
incremental change,'' said Forest Service scientist Jerry Franklin,
a leading spokesman for the movement. ``In terms of forestry
practice, it is revolutionary.''
   The New Forestry is gaining credibility in the midst of debate
over how much national forest can be logged while preserving the old
growth ecosystem. Pressure to log these forests has increased as
private lands have been overcut.
   ``We need to make this crisis the basis for not just resolving
the issue of how much old growth to leave, but perhaps more
important, how do we manage our commodity lands over the long
term,'' Franklin said.
   ``People are looking for ways to harvest the forest and provide
jobs, yet keep values that are important to the public,'' said Gold
Beach District Ranger Kathy Johnson. ``The public is interested in
old-growth forest, interested in the species that inhabit the old
growth forest.
   ``We think there is an opportunity for these New Forestry
techniques to provide that middle ground.''
   While most national forests in Oregon and Washington still are
developing 10-year management plans, the Siskiyou National Forest
has fit the New Forestry into its plan with a goal of balancing
production against a healthy forest.
   The key to New Forestry is to save more of the forest's parts so
what is left after logging has the best chance of surviving radical
climate changes a growing number of scientists predict will come
within the next 50 years.
   On the Siskiyou, the New Forestry is the basis for plans to start
logging in the next couple years the 7,100 acres known as the Illahe
Project, about 40 miles west of Grants Pass in southwestern Oregon.
   ``As we move out from that large block of old-growth forest into
areas previously harvested, we feather out the impacts,'' said
Johnson. ``We'll leave a certain amount of old-growth trees per
acre. That number increases as you get closer to the undisturbed
block of old growth forest.''
   That differs radically from traditional practice of clearcuts of
20 to 40 acres scattered throughout the forest in hopes of diluting
the impact.
   As scientists have learned more about how pieces of the forest
interact they have found that scattered clearcuts fragmented the
ecosystem, breaking it into pieces too small to function. They also
have found it valuable to leave corridors linking the pieces of
forest.
   Instead of clearcutting, New Foresters will leave dead trees and
some live trees standing to give animals places to feed and live.
Some logs will be left to rot and restore organic material to the
soil. Planners say the New Forestry will mean a 5 percent cut in
timber production over the 130-year harvest cycle.
   No decision has been made on how to approach slash burning, in
which debris left by clearcutting is burned to return minerals to
the soil, reduce fire danger, and make it easier to plant seedlings,
Johnson said.
   When it comes to replanting logged-over land, the New Forestry
suggests restoring the mix of species that were cut, to maintain a
diverse genetic base more able to withstand future climatic change,
rather than filling the land with one commercially valuable species
such as Douglas fir.
   Oregon State University forestry professor David Perry, also part
of the New Forestry movement, said, ``The point is that whatever you
do to take trees off it has got to be consistent with the
adaptations of the forest that have evolved over millenia to cope
with disurbance.''

<HEAD>Debate Focuses on Whether To Log or Preserve Virgin Forests</HEAD>

   Robert Hornbeck aimed his truck up the
winding mountain road and eyed the aged forest looming above.
   ``There is your pristine old-growth forest,'' said the logger,
pointing to silver shafts of dead and dying trees within the green
shag of hemlock, fir and lighter-colored cedar. ``To me, it's not
beauty. It's a little bit pathetic. It's a forest that's overripe.
   ``It would have been logged by now, but it was pulled from the
market because of the spotted owl, and I don't think it will ever be
logged now. If they take it away, it's a way of life that is gone,
not just jobs.''
   Whether, when, and where cutting may resume in many Northwestern
national forests won't be known until U.S. District Judge William
Dwyer in Seattle decides whether to alter a March injunction
temporarily halting the sale of 1 billion board feet of timber in
Oregon and Washington.
   Dwyer's ruling came in a lawsuit challenging a Forest Service
plan to set aside 374,000 acres as habitat for the Northern spotted
owl. Environmentalists charged that the plan fails to set aside
enough old-growth forest to ensure the owls' survival; Dwyer's
injunction expands the affected acreage.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife _ which refused in 1987 to
list the spotted owl as a threatened species _ reversed itself in
March and decided the bird's dwindling habitat warrants giving it
that status, a year-long process.
   Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt and state congressional leaders have
called a summit meeting Saturday in Salem to try to resolve
conflicts over the owl. The governor, the state's entire
congressional delegation and representatives of government agencies
and timber and environmental groups will attend.
   The prospect that the owl will be listed as a threatened species
has added more doubt to the future of timber supplies.
   But there is much more at stake than board feet of lumber and a
subspecies of spotted owls, said forest ecologist Peter Morrison of
The Wilderness Society's Seattle office, who insists, ``I'm no tree
hugger.''
   ``We need to consider long-term impacts on biological
diversity,'' said Morrison, noting that relatively little is known
about virgin forests and interactions between plants and animals in
them.
   ``I can see serious impacts if we give up that biological
diversity found in an ancient forest, and by then it will be too
late. ... It's not going to be just the spotted owl disappearing.''
   The unique attachment of the owl to old growth is what put the
bird in the middle of controversy. Biologists say that while the owl
can use other forest land, it requires a certain amount of old
growth for nesting and mating. If that old growth is too fragmented,
the owl could spend so much time seeking food and shelter that it
wouldn't have time or energy to mate.
   The Forest Service doesn't know how much old growth is left, but
The Wilderness Society has estimated that less than 15 percent of
the original old-growth forest remains in the owl's range from
northern California to southern British Columbia. What is left is so
badly fragmented that much of it is worthless as habitat for the owl
and other wildlife.
   ``People want to say, `Let's sit down at a table and reasonably
talk about this dividing of a loaf,' when in reality the loaf is all
gone. What we are doing is squabbling over the crumbs,'' said Rick
Brown, a former Mount Hood National Forest biologist now working for
the National Wildlife Federation.
   But Ted Anderson, executive director of FFACTS, a group in
Washington's Skagit Valley organized this spring to defend the
timber industry, said it's the livelihood of workers and their
families that's at stake.
   National parks, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers and
other set-asides have removed 53 percent of the federal forest lands
in Washington from the timber base, he said. ``We simply can't write
off our industry.''
   For example, six timber sales in the Mount Baker District
covering half of the 2,200 acres set aside for one pair of spotted
owls would have produced 47 million board feet of timber to keep
local mills running for the next year.
   ``To us, that's our life,'' said Anderson. ``To them, it's for
one owl.''
   Andy Kerr, conservation director of the Oregon Natural Resources
Council, said timber jobs are going, owl or no owl. He cited a study
by The Wilderness Society estimating that the 71,500 timber jobs in
Washington and Oregon in 1985 will shrink to half that by 2030
mainly because of increased mill productivity. Stopping the harvest
of old growth altogether would eliminate only 6 percent of the
timber and 2,300 extra jobs in that period, the study said.
   Chuck Sisco of the National Audubon Society, another Forest
Service veteran, said the agency has bungled the works since 1978,
when it picked the owl as the indicator species for the well-being
of the old-growth ecosystem under provisions of the National Forest
Management Act.
   About two-thirds of the sites the Forest Service identified in
Oregon and Washington as owl habitats would affect lumbering, but
``their own data showed that 65 or 70 percent of the areas they said
were spotted owl sites in wilderness (where logging is prohibited)
didn't have any birds in them,'' Sisco said.
   On the west side of the Olympics, Larry Mason, owner of the Mason
Lumber mill in Beaver, reiterated the doubts held by many in the
timber industry that the spotted owl is threatened. Even if the
owl's days are numbered, he said, it is not responsible to shut
timber supplies down overnight.
   Mason complained that the fight over the owl vividly illustrates
the growing urban-rural separation in Washington, where the
Seattle-area economy has been fueled by a growing aerospace industry
and computer-age businesses while the traditional forest industry
has been pushed aside.
   ``You know,'' he said, ``There are people who have to get their
hands dirty every day earning a living, and there are city people
who think the forests should be their private playgrounds.''

   The 15-foot cross made of old-growth timber
stands across from Jerry Leppell's saw shop, where it was hewn.
   A half-dozen plastic owls are nailed to the crossbeam with a sign
that says: ``Here lie the hopes and dreams of our children.''
   The residents of this Olympic Peninsula logging town say they are
being crucified by environmentalists and the government, which have
closed, at least temporarily, thousands of acres of timber to
preserve old-growth forest and one of its elusive denizens, the
Northern spotted owl.
   ``Every way you turn, the government, the preservationists, big
business, they all want your job,'' said Garth Leavitt, a log
hauler. ``What do they want us to do? Move to the cities where
there's no work and no place to live?''
   Forks _ an isolated town of 3,000 on the western edge of the
Olympic National Park, 150 miles from Seattle _ sits in a broad
valley surrounded by bare green hills that still bear scars of what
modern loggers contemptuously call ``cut-and-run boys'' who took the
timber but didn't bother to replant.
   Logging trucks roar down a main street of gas stations and small
stores. Neighborhoods are dotted with swingsets, lush gardens and
yards decorated with rusting saws and other logging tools. The air
carries the peaceful aroma of burning cedar chips from nearby shake
mills.
   But like timber towns across the Northwest, Forks isn't peaceful.
   Yellow ``solidarity'' ribbons flutter on fenceposts and pickup
truck aerials from Forks to Oregon's Willamette Valley, where a
Eugene man is selling hundreds of T-shirts that read, ``Save a
logger, eat an owl.''
   Organized by the timber companies, labor unions and local
governments, millworkers and their families are turning out in
massive demonstrations. About 1,500 participated in a log truck
parade in the Columbia Gorge town of Hood River, Ore. More than
1,000 rallied at the Oregon Capitol.
   The pain from the shutdown of federal timber sales ``really
hasn't hit yet. There's still timber in the pipeline from sales
before this thing got going,'' said Mayor Warren Paul, adding that
it probably will hit just before winter.
   But Forks merchants say people already are pinching pennies, and
houses are going up for sale as loggers leave for Alaska's Tongass
National Forest.
   ``We have a house payment, and a new truck and stuff,'' said
Renee Robinson, a waitress and part of a third-generation logging
family. ``We don't know what's going to happen. A lot of people are
going to Alaska.
   ``We're all scared.''
   At the mental health center serving Forks and Clallam County,
director Steve Ironhill said the area already has the highest
suicide rate in the state and an alcoholism rate among the top 10
percent of U.S. counties. The pending economic disaster ``is going
to be the thing that is going to turn the community upside down.''
   Ironhill, a psychologist, said he hears the fear from children he
and his staff treat for abuse and other problems. ``I'm hearing them
say: `The spotted owl won't let my daddy work,' or `Daddy isn't
working,' or `Daddy went to Alaska.'''

<HEAD>Kentucky Ruling May Signal New Life For School Finance Reform Movement</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In 1964, a University of Chicago law student
named Arthur Wise got the novel idea that school funding formulas
based on unequal property taxes violated the constitution.
   Twenty-five years later, that legal theory by a fledgling lawyer
has helped change the shape of school finance in some three dozen
states.
   This month, Kentucky became the latest to feel its effects. That
state's highest court ordered the legislature to come up with a new
system of public schooling that gives rich and poor kids an even
shake.
   As radical as that may sound, nearly three decades of experience
with school funding reform suggests that change in Kentucky will be
slow in coming _ and probably hard fought.
   By 1967, Wise had spelled out his theories in a book, ``Rich
Schools Poor Schools.'' The idea, simple but elegant, was that
funding formulas used by virtually all states deny children in poor
communities ``equal protection of the law'' as guaranteed by the
14th Amendment.
   States, and even some educators, have countered that intangibles
like dedication count more than money in creating better schools.
Reformers like Wise insist that all the dedication in the world
won't provide kids foreign language teachers and decent science
labs. Only money can.
   Wise's 228-page book became the bible for the budding school
finance reform movement. The cause won big victories in the 1970s
when civil rights and equity topped the education agenda.
   One result: the average state share of education spending rose
from 40.9 percent in 1970 to an estimated 50.2 percent in 1989,
while the local share dipped from 51.8 percent to 43.6 percent,
according to National Education Association statistics. The
remaining share is federal aid.
   Finance reform faded through the 1980s as state money tightened,
the property tax revolt spread, and the education reform debate
shifted from equity to excellence.
   But the funding reform movement is showing signs of new life
lately. That's especially true in some agricultural states where
poor districts, already strapped by declining farm values and lower
property tax receipts, nonetheless must meet state mandates for
costly school reforms.
   Montana's Supreme Court declared that state's school funding
system unconstitutional in February. The Legislature opens a special
session on Monday to meet a July 1 deadline to devise a new one.
   A similar challenge in Texas is heading for that state's highest
court, as is one in New Jersey. A group of poor Tennessee districts
have banded together to sue that state.
   In Kentucky, the Supreme Court decision didn't stop at ordering
an overhaul of state school funding to make it fairer to poor
children. It said the whole school system had to change, top to
bottom.
   ``Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that
Kentucky's entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,''
wrote Chief Justice Robert Stephens.
   Rich and poor alike ``must be given the same opportunity and
access to an adequate education,'' the court ruled in the case
brought four years ago by a coalition of 66 ``property poor''
Kentucky districts.
   Wise and other school finance experts called the ruling a
bombshell, probably the most sweeping of its kind. Yet history
suggests change may not be as quick or dramatic as the ruling
implies.
   ``Even when you win, you have to go to the state legislature and
start all over again,'' said Peter D. Veillette, a school finance
specialist at the National Education Association.
   It's been 16 years, for example, since New Jersey's highest court
ruled in Robinson vs. Cahill that that state's financing system
violated the state constitution's education clause guaranteeing a
``thorough and efficient system of free public schools.''
   But inequities persist, and lawyers representing poor New Jersey
students will reargue the case in state Supreme Court next September.
   Wise, now director of the RAND Corporation's Center for the Study
of the Teaching Profession in Washington, said that affluent
Moorestown, N.J., spends $3,000 more per pupil than East Orange,
N.J. One result is that Moorestown provides one computer per 11
students, compared to one per 43 East Orange pupils.
   New Jersey state education commissioners have criticized poor
districts for the weak quality of schooling ``but have failed along
with the Legislature to provide full equalization,'' Wise said.
   ``The powers that be would rather regulate than provide money.''
   That doesn't mean such lawsuits accomplish nothing. It does mean
that the national scorecard has been uneven.
   The legal principles underlying the funding reform movement have
fared badly in federal court. They flunked their biggest test in
1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court sustained Texas' funding system. It
held that inequality was an unfortunate but unavoidable byproduct of
the principle of local control over schools.
   That setback led reform advocates to focus on state courts where
they found greater success.
   A recent study of school finance cases by Robert Berne, associate
dean of New York University's Graduate School of Public
Administration, found that state courts have overturned funding
systems in 11 states since 1970: New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin,
California, Connecticut, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming,
Arkansas, and this year, Montana and Kentucky.
   The first big decision, Serrano vs. Priest in California in 1971,
has meant that per pupil spending is now virtually equal _ within
$200 per pupil _ in 95 percent of that state's school districts. An
added factor was property-tax slashing Proposition 13, which led the
state to increase its share of education spending from 37.3 percent
in 1970 to 69.1 percent in 1989 to help bail out cash-starved
districts.
   But courts have sustained systems in 10 other states: Arizona,
Michigan, Idaho, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, Colorado, New
York and Maryland.
   Such states typically have defended their funding systems by
citing the Texas argument that the principle of local control of
schooling justified wide spending discrepancies among districts.
Many also cited ``effective-schools'' research suggesting that
dedication and sound school leadership mean more to learning than
money.
   Wise dismisses such arguments. No research has ever shown, he
said, ``that a school with high expectations and no German teacher
will produce students who speak German, or that a school with
orderly classrooms and no laboratory facilities will train its
students to be good scientists.''
   The recent history of school finance reform shows, above all,
that court rulings, even one so sweeping as in Kentucky, are but a
first step in a long, bitter and politically-charged process.
   As Michael W. La Morte, an education professor at the University
of Georgia, pointed out in a study published in November: ``Initial
responses by legislatures or state education agencies to
court-ordered reforms have frequently been brought back to courts
for later, and often protracted, rounds of deliberation.''
   School funding formulas die hard.

<HEAD>Spill Changes Tanker Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE BARTLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small navy of spill response vessels
being assembled in Prince William Sound is the most graphic evidence
of the changes affecting tanker traffic since the nation's worst oil
spill.
   ``We've had to scour the world for the equipment, and we're still
recruiting,'' says Tom Brennan of the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.
The consortium of North Slope oil producers operates the
trans-Alaska pipeline that carries one-fourth of the nation's oil
supply, and the tanker terminal at Valdez.
   An interim plan Alyeska submitted in the face of criticism over
its handling of the Exxon Valdez spill provides for a response team
of 10 vessels and 48 people capable of skimming nearly 11,000
barrels an hour virtually anywhere in the sound within 10 hours. It
also calls for more pilots and escorts for tankers, and Breathalyzer
tests for tanker captains and crews.
   Crew members will be tested before entering the tanker terminal
if guards suspect they are intoxicated. Alyeska already has denied
three people access to their ships; drunken sailors previously were
turned over to their captains.
   Captains now are tested an hour before they sail; if they fail
they will be removed from their vessels and authorities will be
notified. All those tested apparently have passed the test Brennan
describes as very unusual. ``I don't think it's done anywhere else
in the world,'' he says.
   Under a plan in effect March 24, when the Exxon Valdez ran
aground on Bligh Reef and dumped almost 11 million gallons of oil,
Alyeska promised to have people and equipment on scene within five
hours. It took almost 12.
   Gov. Steve Cowper threatened to shut down the pipeline if Alyeska
didn't come up with something better, and six weeks later it offered
the new plan.
   Before the spill, one tugboat accompanied loaded tankers through
the Valdez Narrows into the sound. A state-licensed pilot got off
short of Bligh Reef.
   Under the new system, one tug and a 210-foot ``escort response
vessel'' will accompany every loaded tanker to Hinchenbrook
Entrance, leading from the sound to the Gulf of Alaska. The escort
vessel will have two skimmers, almost 14,000 feet of containment
boom and storage capacity of 4,000 barrels.
   Seventy-five to 80 loaded tankers leave Valdez a month, Brennan
says, and Alyeska will have three escorts, enough to handle the
tankers in the sound at any one time.
   State-licensed pilots will accompany tankers past Bligh Reef, the
last prominent obstacle between Valdez and Hinchenbrook. From there,
tankers must have a federally licensed pilot; some tanker captains
also are licensed pilots. Once past Hinchenbrook, all pilotage
restrictions are off.
   When traffic was backed up by weather or loading problems,
tankers have always anchored at Knowles Head, a sheltered area on
the southwest side of the peninsula between the Port of Fidalgo and
Port Gravina, about 30 miles south of Valdez.
   Under the new system, two more vessels will be anchored there
around the clock. One will be a tug with a barge capable of holding
140,000 barrels of oil. The other will have equipment to pump oil
off a damaged tanker and a storage capacity of 180,000 barrels.
Their only responsibility will be responding to a tanker accident.
   Two storage barges, with a combined capacity 136,000 barrels will
be kept in Valdez. Each will carry absorbent material and 16,000
feet of boom. Two tugs will be stationed there to tow the barges to
a spill and assist a grounded tanker. A vessel with boom deployment
equipment will round out the fleet.
   Another 8,000 feet of boom will be stored at the tanker terminal,
giving Alyeska a total of almost 39,000 feet _ almost twice as much
as was immediately available for the Exxon Valdez spill.
   It is still unclear what the new measures will cost. ``Obviously
it is in the millions of dollars. How many millions, we can't say
yet,'' Brennan says.
   One thing that hasn't changed is Coast Guard monitoring of tanker
traffic.
   Lt. Cmdr. Tom Falkenstein, second in command of the Port of
Valdez marine safety office, emphasizes that the Coast Guard's role
is purely advisory as an aid to navigation. ``We do not control
their movements. We're not like air traffic controllers.''
   The ultimate responsibility always rests with a ship's master,
and federal law would have to change to give the Coast Guard more
authority, he says. ``I don't anticipate that we're going to begin
controlling vessel movements.''
   The Coast Guard has asked for about $12,000 in computer equipment
to improve its monitoring, but Falkenstein says he doesn't forsee
installation of stronger radar. He estimates the cost of providing
radar coverage of the entire sound at $24 million, not including
personnel and housing.
   Under ideal conditions, he says, the radar will reach just beyond
Bligh Reef. Ideal conditions are rare in Prince William Sound, and
frequently radar coverage won't reach even to the reef.
   ``Tanker traffic in the port has not changed significantly'' from
the Coast Guard's perspective, Falkenstein says. ``It's not business
as usual by any stretch. But our procedures haven't changed because
there was nothing wrong to begin with.''

   Pro basketball player Vern Fleming used to
worry that when he was hit in the mouth his teeth would spill out
onto the court. Years of neglect had left the Indiana Pacers guard's
upper teeth decayed and loose.
   Georgia Price never had real teeth, only soft tooth buds barely
emerging from her gums where her baby teeth never came in. The
Bloomington nurse, now 41, received her first dentures at age 3{ and
a second set at 12.
   Both have found relief with permanent implants, teeth anchored on
metal rods supported by frameworks hidden underneath the gums.
   ``I always thought how wonderful it would be to feel like I have
teeth,'' Price said. ``I speak clearer now without my teeth flying
across the room.''
   Dental implants have been around since the early Egyptians but
remain largely unknown among the public. More frustrated denture
wearers are receiving them, though, as implants gain wider
acceptance among dentists.
   A National Institutes of Health conference last year said in a
statement that the number of dentists performing implants had grown
tenfold in five years and that 300,000 Americans a year will be
getting implanted teeth by 1992.
   Implant dentistry was a $150 million industry last year,
estimated Dr. Richard Guaccio of Lake County, president of the
2,000-member American Academy of Implant Dentistry.
   Some dentists caution that implants aren't for everyone,
particularly those with overriding health problems and those who
won't give the devices the care and cleaning necessary to prevent
infection and prosthetic failure.
   Few people enjoy having to take dentures out at night, and some
are embarrassed to let their spouses or others see them without
their false teeth, said Dr. Craig Cooper of Indianapolis, who does
300-400 implants a year. ``They eat better, but it's way beyond that
from a psychological point of view.''
   Sixty percent of the respondents to a marketing survey last year
had never heard of implants, said Cooper, who directs the faculty at
the Midwest Implant Institute in Columbus, Ohio, which has trained
600 dentists in implantology since 1981.
   Yet a survey three years ago by the National Institute of Dental
Research suggests many people could use them. Forty-two percent of
Americans over age 65 and 4 percent of those aged 35 to 64 have no
teeth, it reported.
   The growing older market, a wealthy segment of the population,
provides implant dentistry with a tremendous opportunity for growth,
and manufacturers have provided a variety of devices, Cooper said.
``It's exponential growth. There are fewer and fewer patients we
cannot treat.''
   The American Dental Association has reservations.
   ``In general the feeling is that implants can be used on a
selected basis, depending on the patient and the patient's
condition,'' said Dr. Wayne Wozniak, of ADA's Chicago laboratory on
certification and product research. ``It should only be done on
people the dentist feels can properly maintain the implant. It
requires meticulous oral hygiene after the device has been placed.
So it requires a highly motivated individual.''
   Infection around the implant would erode the bone where many of
the devices are implanted; lack of adequate bone would immediately
eliminate some patients from being implant candidates. One implant,
subperiosteal, is not based in bone and consists of a wiry framework
fitted between the bone and the gum.
   Depending on the type, implants can cost as little as $600 for a
single tooth or as much as $10,000 for a full upper or lower arch,
and some procedures are covered by Medicare. Most are performed as
outpatient surgery.
   The NIH statement said there was little information on long-term
effectiveness of implants and called for a national registry to
collect data. However, it's generally considered 80 percent to 90
percent of implants are successful for at least five to 10 years.
   Cooper, who inserted the 28-year-old Fleming's subperiosteal
implant, said it should last the rest of his life with proper care.
   Implants can last 20 years and more, said Guaccio, estimating
that after 18 years, ``about 87 percent of the implants I've ever
placed are still functioning in the mouth.''

<HEAD>Outlook For Sea Cows Bleak As Boat Traffic Increases</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to CORRECT spelling of Marjory sted Marjery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA WALEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A groggy volunteer crew of five gathered early New
Year's Day and raced to where a 500-pound sea cow had been found
with deep gashes from a boat propeller in its grayish-brown,
leathery back.
   But the West Indian manatee wasn't injured in the congested
Intracoastal Waterway, it was the Everglades. ``It shows you they
aren't safe anywhere,'' said Dr. Gregory Bossart, Miami Seaquarium
veterinarian and pathologist.
   Besides the unmistakable prop marks, the manatee had three
fractured ribs and a punctured lung. The injuries caused a bubble to
form inside the animal, leaving it floating helplessly.
   The manatee _ dubbed Marjory after Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a
protector of the Everglads _ has been recovering at the Seaquarium,
one of two marine parks _the other is Sea World in Orlando _ in
Florida that are authorized to rescue the protected animal.
   An estimated 1,200 of the prehistoric-looking creatures live in
Florida, based on aerial surveys. The docile, plant-eating
creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and ranging from eight to
14 feet long, are found from northern South America to as far north
Virginia.
   They face a growing threat from Florida's development boom.
   A total of 133 manatee deaths were reported last year, including
a record 43 from being hit by boats; there were 39 boat-related
deaths in 1987. The 45 deaths so far this year exceeds the 1987
period. Through March, 15 deaths have been blamed on boats, and 23
carcasses were recovered last month alone.
   ``Our guess is that the numbers increased through the '60s and
'70s as there was more protection, but in the '80s they've held
about steady,'' said Dr. Bruce Ackerman, a state marine mammal
researcher. ``If that's the case, the fact that deaths are
increasing is of considerable concern.''
   Even if boat-related deaths were reduced, the manatee faces other
obstacles such as a low reproductive rate and diminishing habitat,
officials say.
   ``We're not that optimistic. ... Their ability to recover from
any kind of problem is limited, even if everything was perfect,''
Ackerman said.
   The rehabilitation of injured manatees is a painstaking process
that takes months. There is also the question of what awaits them
and babies born in captivity once they are returned to the wild.
   ``There's no problem with breeding in the wild. The problem we
have is habitat destruction,'' said J.P. Garner, assistant manager
of Homosassa Springs Park, where nine manatees are kept.
   Manatees rely on seagrass beds for food and have begun to
congregate around the warm-water discharges of power plants, where
boat traffic is often heavy.
   Patrick Rose, a marine mammal coordinator for the state
Department of Natural Resources, said Florida is focusing efforts on
tying manatee protection to county growth management plans. In
addition, there has been an extensive campaign to increase public
awareness about the creatures' plight.
   Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffet gave a big boost to the manatee
cause eight years ago when he became chairman of the ``Save the
Manatee Club,'' which now boasts an international membership of
about 22,000.
   ``They have absolutely no ability to be aggressive,'' said Rose.
``People identify with them as the ultimate victim.''
   More than five months after being picked up, Marjory remains in
guarded but stable condition in a Seaquarium tank, Bossart said.
``She's feeling a lot better and is able to dive better.''
   Unlike many others of the gentle mammals, she still has a
fighting chance.

<HEAD>Occidental To Redevelop Oil Field Where 167 Workers Were Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Ltd. says it plans to
redevelop the Piper Alpha oil field where 167 workers were killed
last summer in the North Sea oil industry's worst disaster.
   Occidental Petroleum said Thursday that its new single, fixed
platform, would keep the main controls and sleeping quarters
``completely isolated'' from the drilling and processing equipment.
   Most of the victims of the July 1988 explosion and fire died in
an accommodation area located near processing equipment. Some
industry critics since have called on oil companies to remove living
areas from drilling platforms.
   A public inquiry into the cause of the disaster is currently
under way.
   Occidental said it awarded contracts worth 175 million pounds, or
approximately $264 million, to four British companies for the
redevelopment.
   ``We are fully sympathetic towards the people still trying to
come to terms with their grief following last year's tragic
accident,'' said John Brading, chairman of Occidental U.K., whose
parent company Occidental Petroleum Corp. is based in Los Angeles.
   ``The company must also be mindful of its responsibilities to its
1,000 employees in the United Kingdom and a further 2,500 people who
will find jobs as a direct result of these contract awards.''
   The company said it hopes to get the field back into production
in 1992.
   The consortium operating the field, made up of Occidental, Texaco
Britain Ltd., Lasmo North Sea PLC and Union Texas Petroleum Ltd.,
have agreed on the plans for the project.
   The new rig will be designed to handle 120,000 barrels of oil a
day for export via the existing pipeline system leading to the
Occidental consortium's oil handling terminal at Flotta, in the
Orkney Islands. The old rig produced 160,000 barrels a day.
   Brading said that the platform's new design ``incorporates all of
the lessons learned to date from the disaster and has the
flexibility to include any recommendations ... following the
conclusion of the Piper inquiry.''
   ``Our intention is that the new production facilities will
include state-of-the-art safety concepts and technology,'' he said.
   Occidental said it shortly would submit the redevelopment plans
to the government for approval.
   The contracts were awarded to Brown and Root Vickers Ltd.;
British Steel PLC; McDermott Scotland Ltd.; and Press Offshore Ltd.

   Integrated Resources Inc.'s stock price plunged
nearly 50 percent after the insurance and mutual fund company said
it was halting payment on $864 million in short-term debt.
   Integrated, which has $7.8 billion in assets, said Thursday the

subsidiaries nationwide, which would continue to make payments to
creditors.
   On Wednesday, banks withdrew Integrated's access to short-term

   Integrated said it did not have the money to pay off its debt,
including some $373 million in commercial paper and loan shares that
come due in the next 45 days. The debt payments amount to about $8
million a day.
   Integrated also has $491 million in short-term bank credit lines
mostly payable on demand.
   The company's stock plunged $5.75 to close at $6.25 a share in
New York Stock Exchange trading Thursday. Volume was 1.7 million
shares, about four times the trading activity on Wednesday. The
stock closed at $15.37{ on Tuesday.
   ``The company believes it has a short-term liquidity problem,''
Integrated spokesman David Caouette said. ``We're working with a
group of banks and ... negotiations are being closely held and
they're progressing.''
   Integrated, founded in 1969, is a diversified financial services
company with operations in mutual funds and money management,
limited partnerships, and life insurance and annuities. It has $1.1
billion in capital.
   Analysts said Integrated has fared poorly in recent years as it
expanded but was unable to establish a foothold in the insurance
field. The company also says it has had problems because of high
up-front costs such as fees, commissions and carrying costs for
investments later sold as partnerships.
   Integrated issued a statement saying it had scheduled a meeting
of creditors and short-term credit suppliers for Monday to discuss
reaching a debt restructuring package.
   Integrated has said it is trying to arrange new credit with some
of its banks and exploring other sources of capital. On Wednesday,
its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., halted sales of
Integrated's short-term commercial paper.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the debt-rating service, on Thursday
lowered Integrated's rating on bonds, preferred stock and commercial
paper affecting about $1.2 billion in securities. It was the second
rating downgrade in two days.

<HEAD>Indicted Bond Trader Quits Drexel, Sets Up Own Firm</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, the fallen Drexel Burnham Lambert
financier, is striking out on his own.
   But what isn't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow
the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long the
venture will last with Milken facing a lengthy jail term.
   Milken, 42, resigned Thursday after 19 years at Drexel, where he
began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate
America in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade
securities called junk bonds.
   Milken, who made a reported $550 million in 1987, said he is
forming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raise
money to start up, grow or stay in business.
   But he faces $1.85 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegal
profits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment, the government's largest securities crime
prosecution to date.
   People involved in Milken's plans for the new firm, International
Capital Assets Group, said Milken does not intend to raid Drexel's
Beverly Hills, Calif., junk bond division, which he founded and ran
until his March indictment.
   The principals in the new firm, which now has a handful of
employees and a temporary Los Angeles office, are not going to be
``Drexel people,'' Milken associates said.
   But Milken still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk
bond employees and Drexel clients, and no one is ruling out
defections. Milken associates did not release details on his plans,
including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed.
   A Drexel official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with Milken's new
firm because it will not be in the brokerage business.
   Under Drexel's still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider
trading and other fraud charges with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing business
with Milken, directly or indirectly.
   The Drexel official said the provision likely will be reviewed on
a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the New York
investment firm's clients and Milken may occur. For instance, Milken
may be able to refer clients to Drexel and vice versa but not
receive any fees.
   Milken's resignation ends the relationship between one of the
most important financial players of the decade and the firm he
helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth
largest.
   ``Michael Milken made many important contributions to Drexel
Burnham, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad
event,'' Drexel stated. ``We wish him well in his new endeavor.''
   Milken widely was credited with creating a $175 billion-a-year
junk bond market. His pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously used
mainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the
decade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and
corporate raiders a tool for financing growth, mergers and takeovers.
   But the federal government alleges Milken used his powers through
Drexel to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemes
with now-jailed stock speculator Ivan Boesky.
   He also is accused of insider trading in a separate SEC lawsuit.
No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case.
   Milken had been on leave from Drexel since his criminal
indictment. His brother, Lowell, who also was charged in the case,
announced Thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicing
law.
   ``I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave Drexel as
part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look
forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,''
Michael Milken said in a statement.
   Milken joined Drexel full-time in 1970 after graduating from the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. In 1978, he moved
Drexel's junk bond division to Beverly Hills.
   Milken's trial in federal court in Manhattan is set for next
March. He is free under a $700 million bond package.
   Lawyers close to the case indicated Milken's decision to resign
was calculated. By quitting, Milken pre-empts the firm's agreement
with the SEC to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by a
federal judge.
   With Milken's resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of the
Drexel pact are moot and mount further challenges. They also are
expected to challenge the provision barring Drexel and Milken from
doing business with the same clients.

<HEAD>Japanese Buying An American Institution, The Thermos Bottle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Thermos Co. built its business on keeping hot
drinks hot, but some construction workers who sip their lunchtime
coffee from Thermos bottles say the company's sale to a Japanese
firm leaves them cold.
   ``The Japanese are buying up America,'' said Derryl Caldwell, a
hardhat working downtown. ``We like American-made products because
it gives jobs to Americans and helps our economy.''
   Electrician Gary Callahan said he'd stop buying Thermos products
if new owner Nippon Sanso K.K. moves the company's manufacturing
plants out of the United States.
   But Nippon Sanso has no such plans for Thermos, according to Bank
of Tokyo Vice President Yasuo Kezuka, who helped arrange the $134
million purchase from Household International Inc. The deal was
announced Thursday.
   Kezuka said Nippon Sanso will retain all of Thermos' operations,
which include a propane-grill factory and corporate headquarters in
Freeport, Ill., a factory in Batesville, Miss., two plants in the
United Kingdom and one in Canada.
   A Thermos plant in Taftville, Conn., is being closed and is not
included in the sale, said Ron Slade, Thermos' personnel director in
Freeport. The company employs 1,900 people worldwide.
   Kezuka relayed a statement from Nippon Sanso, which already has a
line of steel vacuum bottles, saying the company ``will try to make
good synergy by combining the Japanese technique and the famous
Thermos brand. They will try to keep a leading position in the
housewares products area.''
   Nippon Sanso is a major manufacturer of industrial gas and is
diversifying into consumer products, Household International said.
   Thermos invented the glass vacuum bottle in 1907 and developed a
large line of insulated containers for toting food and drink.
   Although it is best known for its bottles and lunchboxes,
including the cartoon-character lunchbuckets that are still popular
with children, Thermos also makes gas grills, insulated coolers and
other household and recreational products.
   Household International, based in the Chicago suburb of Prospect
Heights, said it expects to close the cash transaction by the end of
August.
   Thermos is the largest of six manufacturing subsidiaries put on
the block by Household, which hopes to focus its business on
financial services. It owns Household Finance Corp.
   Thermos had sales of about $194 million in 1988.
   Household said in January it planned to divest all of its
manufacturing operations. In April it spun off to its shareholders
three manufacturing companies: Eljer Industries Inc., Scotsman
Industries Inc. and Schwitzer Inc.
   The company expects to sell its five remaining manufacturing
companies by the end of the summer, said spokesman Robert Hartney.
They are: GC-Thorsen, Albion Industries, King-Sealy, Omni Products
International and WaterTest Corp.
   Household's financial-services businesses are Household Finance,
Household Bank, Household Commercial Finance and the Alexander
Hamilton Life Insurance Co.

<HEAD>Paramount Increasing Pressure on Time, Prods Board for Response</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc., still awaiting a
response to its unwanted $10.7 billion takeover bid for Time Inc.,
has stepped up the pressure on the media giant by indicating it
might sweeten its offer.
   But investors were unimpressed Thursday by the prospect of a
higher bid for Time. The company's stock fell $3.62{ to $171.50 a
share on the New York Stock Exchange on reports the Time board was
leaning toward making a cash tender offer for Warner Communications
Inc. as a way to foil Paramount's $175-a-share bid.
   Time and Warner previously agreed to merge in an all-stock deal.
   In a letter sent Thursday to Time's directors, Paramount Chairman
Martin S. Davis said, ``Since our offer commenced, no representative
of Time has contacted us to discuss our proposal.''
   The Time board, which was considering how to fight Paramount and
whether it could salvage Time's merger with Warner, seemed to be in
no rush to reply to the offer or Davis' letter.
   Time spokesman Edward Adler said the company had no comment on
the letter and would not say when it would respond.
   George Sard, a spokesman for Paramount, an entertainment and
publishing conglomerate, declined to comment on the purpose of the
letter, saying it ``speaks for itself.''
   However, observers said the letter was intended to pressure the
Time board. Davis said Paramount might be willing to raise its bid
if a review of Time's financial records justified a higher offer.
Davis called for a meeting between the two companies at which
Paramount could examine Time's books.
   Time stock _ which has traded as high as $182.75 a share since
the Paramount bid was announced _ fell on the prospect of a Time bid
for Warner, which cast doubt on the Paramount offer. Time has a $5
billion line of credit that it could use to help finance a bid.
   An offer for Warner was one of several options the Time board was
believed to be considering. The others included a recapitalization
of the company, a cash tender offer for Paramount or a continued
pursuit of its planned merger with Warner. Warner also could launch
a cash tender offer for Time.
   Stock in Paramount, formerly called Gulf &amp; Western Inc., was
unchanged at $59.50 a share Thursday, while Warner picked up 62{
cents to close at $55.62{ a share.
   Under the planned Time-Warner merger, Time stockholders would get
a share in the new company for each share they own while Warner
shareholders would get 0.465 of a share of the new company for each
of their Warner shares.
   However, if the two companies were to pursue their merger, it was
widely expected the deal would have to be renegotiated because
Time's stock price has soared from the $126 level it fetched before
Paramount announced its bid.
   In a separate development Thursday, Time and Warner said New York
city officials approved the proposed transfers in ownership of the
six cable franchises in the city owned by either Time or Warner.
   Time and Warner together own cable systems serving about 5.5
million subscribers, but must get permission from local cable
authorities in each case to combine their respective operations
under a Time Warner umbrella.

<HEAD>Gerber, Bristol-Myers Plan To Market Infant Formula to Moms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pediatricians' group is upset with plans by the
baby food maker Gerber Products Co. to market a new infant formula
directly to parents rather than through physicians.
   Gerber disclosed Thursday that it would break with the customary
practice in the infant formula business by advertising its new
Gerber Baby Formula in television commercials and direct mailings to
parents starting in August.
   The new formula, which will be manufactured by Bristol-Myers Co.,
already a big player in the $1.65 billion infant formula market,
will be available starting in September.
   The proposed marketing approach immediately drew fire from the
American Association of Pediatrics, which opposes advertising infant
formula to consumers for fear that it would discourage breast
feeding.
   ``I'm disappointed that Gerber _ with an impeccable reputation in
the field of infant nutrition _ would resort to this tactic,'' said
Dr. Joe Sanders, associate executive director of the academy, based
in Elk Grove Village, Ill.
   Gerber officials said their ads would emphasize that breast
feeding is the preferred method for feeding infants. They said it
would also encourage mothers to talk with their physicians before
deciding on a formula.
   The announcement was unusual in that it links Gerber, which has
twice discontinued infant formula products, with a company that is
already a major factor in that business.
   Bristol-Myers, based in New York, claims a 37 percent share of
the market, with products including Enfamil and ProSobee.
   Abbott Laboratories Inc. has about 52.3 percent of the market,
while Amrican Home Products Corp. is third at 9.7 percent, according
to Gerber's figures.
   Under the agreement, Bristol-Myers will manufacture the new
formula and be responsible for assuring the quality of the product,
while Gerber market it.
   ``Infant formula is a logical extension to our 61-year dedication
to helping parents feed babies,'' said Robert L. Johnston, head of
the Gerber Products division at the Fremont, Mich.-based company.
   Gerber makes about 180 baby food products. The formula will be
available in powdered, concentrated liquid and ready-to-use liquid
forms.
   Gerber spokesman Steven Poole his company sold an infant formula
called Modilac for about 10 years ending in the mid-1960s. It was
discontinued because it was too costly to make and sell at a
competitive price.
   He said Gerber had also made a special formula for infants who
could not tolerate milk but discontinued it about three years ago.
   Bristol-Myers spokesman Dave Dubber said his company approached
Gerber about marketing a new line of formula.
   ``Gerber has a food reputation in this market. We feel they have
a chance to strengthen our position in the market,'' he said.
   He said the Gerber product also will give Bristol-Myers another
outlet for formula. Bristol-Myers sells its infant formula through
pediatricians while Gerber Baby Formula will be sold in stores.
   Infant formula makers have generally avoided marketing directly
to parents. But last year, Carnation Co. came out with two formula
products, Good Start and Good Nature, that were initially promoted
directly to parents.
   The company has quit marketing Good Start to parents, reportedly
under pressure from pediatricians and the Food and Drug
Administration, but still markets Good Nature formula for older
babies to parents.
   Sanders of the pediatrician's group said he ``cannot help but
wonder if there is a subliminal message here that says if you choose
not to breast feed, here is an alternative just as good.''
   Tim Atwater, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based advocacy group
Action for Corporate Accountability, said Gerber has a built-in
conflict by advocating breast feeding while selling a substitute.
   ``They will only make money when moms choose not to breast
feed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Suffers Biggest Plunge in Recent Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar today suffered its biggest
single-day plunge in recent years against the Japanese yen, traders
said, while stock prices gained moderately.
   The dollar closed at 145.05 yen, down from Thursday's closing of
151.30 yen.
   The 6.25-yen drop was reportedy the dollar's largest daily
fluctuation between sessions ever, though an official of the Bank of
Japan, the nation's central bank, said no records were available.
   Several traders contacted by The Associated Press said they could
not remember a larger day-to-day loss.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
489.90 points Thursday in its largest single-day loss this year,
recouped 142.08 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish the week at
33,055.17.
   Volume traded on the first section totaled 500 million shares, up
from 650 million the previous day.
   Traders attributed the dollar's retreat to concerted intervention
overnight by the U.S. and European central banks in overseas markets.
   The Bank of Japan was reported to have sold $200 million to $300
million this morning to accelerate the currency's downward trend,
they said.
   An official of Fuji Bank, a major Japanese commercial bank, said
the dollar ``made a major correction'' after weeks of excessive
rallies against other currencies.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Thursday the nation's
merchandise trade deficit fell to $8.26 billion in April from
March's revised deficit of $9.54 billion.
   Stock dealers said trading was thin in anticipation of the
release of further U.S. economic indicators, including the nation's
consumer price figures for May, due later today in Washington.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rallied somewhat today in early
European trading after plunging in the United States and Tokyo.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Traders said reports of coordinated central bank intervention _
intended to bring the U.S. currency down _ had tended to strengthen
the dollar.
   They said sentiment remained much in favor of the dollar and
attributed Thursday's substantial single-day drop in the United
States to technical selling.
   ``The (dollar's) drop was just too much. Sentiment cannot have
changed so radically,'' said one Italian trader. He said the central
bank intervention wasn't heavy enough to affect rates and the dollar
remained well bid.
   Another Italian trader noted that ``many European banks found the
dollar at relatively cheap levels this morning and started buying
the U.S. unit.''
   The West German Bundesbank started the intervention early today
and was followed by several other European central banks. However,
traders said the intervention was modest.
   In Tokyo, the dollar suffered its biggest single-day plunge in
recent years today but rallied in later European trading. The dollar
fell 6.25 yen to a closing 145.05 yen in Tokyo. Later in London, it
was quoted at a higher rate of 147.05 yen.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.53075 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5195 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday
included: 2.0055 West German marks, down from 2.0235; 1.7290 Swiss
francs, down from 1.7490; 6.8068 French francs, down from 6.8680;
2.2459 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2915; 1,451.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,472.00, and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1993.
   Gold opened in London at $365.80 a troy ounce, compared with late
Thursday's $362.50. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $365.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $365.80 compared with $361.71 late
Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $5.10 to close at $366.67.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.31 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $5.29.

<TEXT>
   The administration is hailing the House version
of savings and loan bailout legislation as a major victory for
taxpayers after the resounding defeat of an attempt to weaken
President Bush's key reform proposal.
   Shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, the House capped a 13-hour
session by voting 320-97 to solve the worst financial crisis since
the Depression with the most expensive government bailout in
history. It will cost, according to the congressional General
Accounting Office, $285 billion over 30 years _ $157 billion of that
from taxpayers.
   The legislation also includes a series of what Bush has labeled
``never again'' provisions. In what the president identified as the
heart of his proposal, it requires S&amp;L owners to risk more of their
own money in a capital cushion between S&amp;L losses and the government
deposit insurance fund.
   ``The American taxpayers won a major victory today when the House
of Representatives voted for strong, tangible capital requirements
for the nation's savings and loans,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady said in a statement.
   ``We applaud the House leadership for moving this bill rapidly
through the House,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The House action paves the way for a conference early next month
with the Senate, which passed its S&amp;L bill in April, and for final
enactment before Congress goes on vacation in August.
   The sharpest conflict between the two chambers will likely be on
their funding plans. The Senate would allow Bush to keep some S&amp;L
spending out of the budget deficit through a plan to sell bonds
through a new quasi-private agency. But the Democratic-dominated
House would swell the deficit by $44 billion, increasing pressure on
the administration to agree to a tax increase, in a bid to cut
long-term interest costs.
   On capital, the House would require S&amp;L owners to risk $3 in
``real money'' capital for every $100 in lending, while the Senate
standard is $1.50.
   Despite heavy industry lobbying, the House, on a 326-94 vote,
rejected an amendment offered by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., which
would have given 241 S&amp;Ls a chance, through an administrative
appeal, to win exemption from new capital requirements.
   Hyde was arguing on behalf of institutions currently benefiting
from an accounting break known as ``supervisory good will.''
Regulators granted the $19.7 billion break to institutions, many of
them in Illinois, that took ailing institutions off the government's
hands in the early 1980s. Supervisory good will allows many of them
to operate without risking any of their owners' money.
   Hyde said the government should keep its word, but his critics
said the policy change was warranted because of the huge bill to
taxpayers.
   Earlier this week, Hyde appeared to have a good chance of
success, but Thursday morning Bush threatened to veto the bill if
House members adopted the amendment.
   ``There should be no mistake. This matter goes to the very heart
of my determination to clean up the abuses of the past among the
savings and loans, about which every voter is entitled to be
outraged,'' the president wrote.
   Both House and Senate versions of the S&amp;L bill reorganize the
bureaucracy to give the administration greater control over S&amp;L
regulators. And, they provide more money _ the House, $75 million,
and the Senate, $50 million _ to detect and prosecute fraud in
financial institutions.
   Among the other differences between the two chambers:
   _The House, unlike the Senate, requires the industry-owned
Federal Home Loan Banks to spend $75 million a year, rising to $150
million by 1995, to subsidize housing for the poor. It barely
defeated, by a 208-204 vote, an attempt by Rep. Steve Bartlett,
R-Texas, to delete the subsidy program, which was written by Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee.
   _By a 214-200 vote, the House also adopted anti-discrimination
provisions sponsored by Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Gonzalez
forcing banks and thrifts to disclose their record of serving the
poor, minorities and women.
   _The Senate permits S&amp;Ls to hold 11 percent of their assets in
high-yield, high-risk debt instruments known as junk bonds, more for
state-chartered S&amp;Ls if they raise extra capital. However, the House
voted 303-114 to adopt an amendment by Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D.,
banning thrifts from holding junk bonds and giving those that
already own the bonds two years to sell them.

   G.D. Searle &amp; Co. has agreed to settle the
claims and lawsuits of more than 100 people linked to its Copper-7
contraceptive device, but a spokeswoman said about 350 other cases
still are pending in courts.
   The agreement, which requires approval from the affected clients
of the Minneapolis law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller and Ciresi,
bars disclosure of any details, said Searle spokeswoman Kay Bruno.
   The settlement also bars the parties from disclosing how many
individuals were covered by the settlement, although the law firm
previously said it represented more than 100 people.
   Even so, Ms. Bruno said the settlement leaves about 350 other
Copper-7 lawsuits in state and federal courts.
   ``At last count, 330 cases involving the Copper-7 had been
disposed of in our favor. Of the 19 that went to trial, we won 15
and lost four,'' said Ms. Bruno.
   ``Two of those are pending appeal and of the two completed, we
have paid a total of about $300,000,'' she added.
   Ms. Bruno confirmed the June 9 agreement in response to questions
from reporters. She also said the settlement ``does not have a
materially adverse effect'' on the financial positions of Searle or
its parent, Monsanto Corp.
   Women who have brought lawsuits against the Skokie-based
pharmaceutical concern contend the Copper-7, once one of the
nation's most widely prescribed intrauterine devices, caused pelvic
inflammations, ectopic pregnancies or perforation of the uterus, and
could result in infertility.
   A Baltimore lawyer whose firm is representing clients in 40
lawsuits and evaluating the claims of several hundred more called
the settlement ``a hopeful sign.''
   ``I couldn't estimate what the settlement may have been worth. My
guess is, that like our firm, Robins, Kaplan, Miller had one group
of cases pending in court and a second group whose cases were being
investigated for possible lawsuits,'' attorney H. Robert Erwin Jr.
said from Baltimore.
   ``Typically, IUD cases can range from $10,000 if the causation is
weak and the injury nominal to $250,000 or more if you have a young,
married couple rendered childless due to an infection from an IUD.''
   Searle pulled the product from the market, along with a second
IUD, in January 1986, citing the high costs stemming from hundreds
of lawsuits. The company has maintained in court documents the
product ``cannot cause the various injuries plaintiffs claim.''
   Esther Kociemba, represented by the Minneapolis firm, was awarded
$8 million last year by a jury in St. Paul, Minn. It could not be
determined whether that case was part of the settlement.
   Michael Ciresi, who has been the firm's lead attorney in Copper-7
cases, did not return messages left with his office.

   A new magazine devoted to the pros and cons of
biodegradable diapers and other ways of dealing with debris promises
to do more than just talk trash.
   If you say, ``What garbage!'' you're not a likely reader of
Garbage.
   But the publishers of this new magazine say the ``throwaway
society'' has gone beyond the concern of the counterculture to
become a mainstream issue.
   ``I think we all feel vaguely uneasy and vaguely guilty when you
bring the groceries home and realize that 60 percent of what you've
bought is packaging,'' said editor-publisher Patricia Poore.
   Formally known as ``Garbage: The Practical Journal for the
Environment,'' it will start publishing in August. Ms. Poore, 33,
said it will have a pro-environment tilt but she promises to be
even-handed.
   ``You have to be pro-environment if you want any quality of life
and possibly if you want any life at all,'' she said, but her
magazine will also print the downside to proposed solutions to
environmental problems.
   When an environmentally sound way of doing things turns out to be
more costly, especially for the poor, Garbage will so report, said
Ms. Poore. ``There often is no easy solution,'' she said.
   The first question the magazine had to confront was whether it
should be printed on recycled paper. The answer may seem obvious,
Ms. Poore said, but it was not.
   ``The editor in me wanted recycled paper,'' she said. ``The
publisher in me didn't.
   ``Recycled paper looks like whole wheat,'' she said. (This was
the publisher speaking.) ``It has gooky things in it. They say it
will break on the press.
   ``The publisher in me said there was nothing wrong with premium
paper. And the printer told us they would charge 30 percent more to
print it on recycled paper!''
   But the art director and the managing editor marched in and said
Ms. Poore would be a hypocrite if she printed Garbage on virgin
paper. The printer, in environmentally conscious Burlington, Vt.,
relented and promised to charge nothing extra for the first three
issues and see how things come out.
   Research located a recycled paper that ``is very white, and film
coated and is easily recyclable itself,'' Ms. Poore said, so the
environment (and the editor) won the battle, for the moment.
   Ms. Poore owns The Old-House Journal, which, like Garbage, is
based in Brooklyn, N.Y. The Old-House Journal was a neighborhood
paper for owners of brownstones in Brooklyn when she bought it 11
years ago, just as the preservation movement was catching on. It now
has a circulation ``approaching 165,000.''
   Garbage, she said, will be the only environmental magazine that
is not issued by activists and therefore free ``to have a sense of
humor.''
   ``If you're the Sierra Club, you've got to take a worst-case view
and a sense of humor is a dangerous thing to have,'' she said.
   The pros and cons of biodegradable diapers will be examined in
the first issue.
   Pro: they self-destruct.
   Con: they introduce human waste into landfills and possibly water
tables.
   The magazine's conclusion: cloth diapers are better, from the
environment's point of view.
   In a solicitation for subscriptions that was mailed to 700,000
homes a week ago (printed on recycled paper, too), Ms. Poore
explains the choice of the magazine's name:
   ``Here we were, planning a new environmental journal, but my
staff and I found ourselves referring to it as `the garbage
magazine.' It dawned on us that that was the right name ... It
doesn't beat around the bush, but goes right to the heart of the
problem: our throwaway society.''

   Fathers who take time off for the birth of a
baby will become the majority in the coming decade, says a new study
that finds dads joining moms in the struggle to cope with work and
family responsibilities.
   ``Balancing work and family responsibilities is becoming a total
work force issue, not just a women's issue,'' reports Sandra Burud
of Burud &amp; Associates in Pasadena, Calif., in the analysis ``The
1990s Father: Balancing Work &amp; Family Concerns.''
   ``We tend to think working moms have a monopoly on guilt, but
it's not true,'' added James Levine of Bank Street College of
Education in New York.
   While fathers continue to face traditional pressure to do well at
work, they also want to spend more time with their children,
reported Levine.
   He and Burud were among several researchers included in the study
compiled by the Bureau of National Affairs, an independent
Washington research group.
   Men are ``feeling that they're repeating the same pattern of
their own fathers, not being around enough,'' noted Levine in the
analysis issued to coincide with Fathers Day.
   A generation ago it would not have occurred to most new fathers
to take time off for the birth of a child, an increasingly common
practice today, said Barney Olmstead, co-director of New Ways to
Work in San Francisco.
   Joseph Pleck of Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., predicts that
fathers taking time off for the birth of a child will become
increasingly commonplace.
   In the 1990s, he said, ``it will become the dominant pattern for
fathers to take one or two weeks off and that the proportion of
fathers who take longer periods of time will grow.
   ``Men are spending more time with their kids, and men and women
are sharing the time they're staying home with sick children,''
reported Carol Ann Rudolph of Child Care Management Resources in
Bethesda, Md. ``But when child-care arrangements break down, it
still is the woman who misses work more often than the man.''
   Fran Rodgers of Work-Family Directions reported that many men are
beginning to seek a balance between work and family _ ``they don't
want to work overtime, they don't want to relocate, and they don't
want their performance measured in terms of hours put in on the
job.''
   ``The intensity of feelings is greater for women, but they're
there for both'' she said.
   While so-called ``family-friendly'' company policies have largely
concentrated on women, more and more they will need to consider
males also, according to the study.
   ``Fathers still define themselves primarily in the family as the
provider,'' observed Stephen Segal of the Philadelphia firm Family
Partners. But, he added, they also are increasingly wanting to be
with their children.
   ``Fathers are connecting with their kids, their young kids, in a
stronger way, and there are expectations for them to connect in a
stronger way than their fathers had, and that sets up the conflicts
for the father as he moves through his career,'' Segal said.
   But, he added, ``It's not altogether socially acceptable for men
to stay home when their kids are sick and such.''
   Some companies are in the early stages of developing ways to aid
working fathers, commented Levine, who operates the Fatherhood
Project at Bank Street College.
   The BNA study said that where child-care facilities are provided,
fathers are increasingly likely to use the facilities and
increasingly often are the ones taking children to medical
appointments and for other obligations.
   Yet, said Patricia D. Hawkins of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, these are relatively rare occasions. ``You
either have to be in a very senior position where you can call your
own shots, or be a specialist,'' she said.

   For the first time since President Bush was
elected on a no-tax-increase pledge, a congressional subcommittee
has voted to raise taxes.
   The House Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources is
calling for a boost in the tax that employers pay for federal
unemployment benefits, which would bring in an estimated $10.6
billion over the next five years. When fully in effect in 1992, it
would cost employers an additional $4 a year for each employee.
   The increase would finance improvements in jobless benefits and
higher spending for child care and welfare. It would also leave $161
million next year, and $1.7 billion over five years, toward reducing
the budget deficit.
   The package was approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote over
Republican opposition. It now goes to the full committee.
   Before the vote, Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant treasury secretary
for tax policy, said the administration is strongly opposed. In the
first place, he said, the unemployment fund does not need more money
_ a statement that was challenged by Democrats on the panel.
   ``Second,'' Gideon wrote, ``increasing the amount of wages
subject to federal unemployment tax is a tax increase and is opposed
by this administration.''
   Bush was elected after a campaign in which his opposition to a
tax increase was repeated several times a day. He also has predicted
that if taxes were raised, Congress would spend the money rather
than cut the deficit.
   ``It's basically a $10 billion tax increase ... and a wish list
of social spending,'' Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo., a member of the
subcommittee, said of the bill. ``Many of the proposals have merit
but I don't think we have the money.''
   He predicted the tax increase will make it far more difficult for
the Ways and Means Committee to meet its deficit-reduction goal.
   Present law requires employers to pay a tax of 0.8 percent of the
first $7,000 earned annually by each employee, a maximum of $56 per
worker. The rate is due to drop to 0.6 percent in 1991.
   The subcommittee's bill would raise the taxable wage to $8,000 in
1990, $9,000 in 1991 and $10,000 in 1992. Thus, the employer's
maximum tax per employee would rise to $60.
   Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee,
rejected the administration's argument that the trust funds from
which unemployment compensation are paid need no extra money.
   ``These accounts currently do not have enough funds on reserve to
cover increased outlays if a recession occurs in the next few
years,'' Downey wrote in presenting his recommendation to the
subcommittee. He noted the administration's estimates are based on
economic assumptions that many economists say are too rosy.
   ``Even with the administration's optimistic assumptions over the
next five years, the administration has projected that the loan
account (which helps states replenish their jobless benefits) will
not have enough reserves by the end of 1994, when its shortfall will
be $3.5 billion,'' Downey said.
   Gideon also opposed the tax increase on grounds that because of
the way the unemployment-benefits system is structured, raising the
federal tax would automatically increase employers' state taxes.
   Among the spending improvements voted by the subcommittee were a
$1.77 billion increase in federal grants to states for such social
services as Meals on Wheels and child-care services; a boost in
Supplemental Security Income, a welfare program for elderly and
disabled, of $2 a month for individuals (to $370) and $3 a month for
couples (to $553); and making it easier for states to trigger
payment of extended unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.

   The Transportation Department is taking the
first step toward nationwide random alcohol testing of airline
pilots, train engineers, ships' officers, pipeline workers and bus
and truck drivers.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told Congress on Thursday
he had asked department lawyers to examine rule-making that would
expand the department's random drug-testing program to include
alcohol. Rules on drug testing of 4 million transportation workers
take effect at the end of the year.
   Skinner said alcohol testing raises complex issues and should not
begin hastily as proposed in a House bill requiring random testing
for both drugs and alcohol among railroad workers. Skinner said he
would recommend that President Bush veto that bill, if adopted,
because it would require the department to start over with its
testing program.
   Skinner testified at a hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science
and Transportation Committee which is considering its own version of
mandatory drug and alcohol testing for transportation workers.
   The Transportation Department last November ordered drug testing
programs in private transportation industries, but the programs face
several court challenges and the congressional bills would give
testing the force of law.
   The Supreme Court has approved some drug testing but has yet to
rule on random testing.
   At the hearing, the proposed Senate bill brought general support
from transportation industry representatives and strong objections
from groups representing the employees who would be tested. The bill
is nearly identical to measures passed by the Senate, but not the
House, in both 1987 and 1988.
   ``I have decided that we must step forward and address the issue
of alcohol misuse in transportation now,'' Skinner told the
committee.
   He noted that a Coast Guard program of mandatory post-accident
alcohol testing for the maritime industry begins in December, but
said more thought is needed before extending the testing to other
modes of transportation. He noted that alcohol is legal while the
drug testing covers illegal substances.
   Skinner said the House version of the anti-drug bill would
mandate random alcohol test rules just 90 days after enactment of
the bill. ``I look to the long term, and I know that to develop a
program that will achieve its objective and withstand legal
challenge requires more care and consideration,'' he said.
   Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said alcohol and
drug use by transportation workers cannot be ignored. He said
railroad accidents linked to drug or alcohol occurred once every 12{
days last year.
   ``Call it intimidation. Call it whatever you will,'' Hollings
said. ``But the fact is that random testing is the only method we
have to reasonably ensure that transportation employees will not use
drugs on the job.''
   Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, sponsor of the House drug bill, said
the bill requiring random testing of railroad workers has bipartisan
support. He accused Skinner of wanting anti-drug measures left to
the ``whims of the transportation secretary.''
   Richard B. Stone of the Air Line Pilots Association said errors
in testing could result in the loss of 200 pilots.
   Stone said no crash of a scheduled airliner has been linked to
alcohol abuse. The National Transportation Safety Board blamed a
January 1988 Colorado crash on cocaine use by the pilot, but Stone
said other possible causes of that crash were not adequately
investigated.
   Stone said random testing would cost the industry millions of
dollars but ``would not produce much.''
   Michael O'Connell, lawyer for a national association of
owner-operated trucks, said ``millions of innocent drivers will be
victimized'' by random tests.
   O`Connell introduced Sandy Craig of Anderson, Ind., who owns and
drives a single truck with her husband, as an example of a driver
who would have to give random urine samples.
   Mrs. Craig, interviewed after the hearing, said she opposes
roadside random testing because it would delay her trips, ``and I
think the procedure proposed is humiliating.''

<HEAD>British Scientists Say They Cannot Duplicate Cold Fusion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers at Britain's Atomic Energy Authority
say they were unable to reproduce cold fusion, something two
University of Utah scientists earlier this year claimed to have
achieved.
   After spending $480,000 over three months trying to repeat the
experiment, the scientists at the British Atomic Energy Authority's
Harwell Laboratory near Oxford said Thursday they failed.
   ``Not every mad idea works out,'' saidteam leader David Williams,
who nonetheless spoke admiringly of the previous work by the two
scientists.
   But one of the two, Martin Fleischmann of Southampton University,
stood by his findings.
   He told Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, ``We
cannot find any flaw in our technique, and we are very happy with
the work we have done so far.''
   Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, of the University of Utah, said on
March 23 they had generated energy with palladium and platinum
electrodes dipped in a beaker of heavy water at room temperature.
   Heavy water is made of oxygen and deuterium, a form of hydrogen
with a neutron in the nucleus.
   In fusion, tremendous amounts of energy are released when the
nucleus, or core, of one hydrogen atom fuses with the nucleus of
another hydrogen atom.
   In contrast, nuclear power plants generate energy from fission,
which is the splitting of atoms.
   Nuclear fusion is the energy source of the sun, and thousands of
researchers have been trying to achieve it for 20 years.
   Reporting on his team's results, Williams said it was unable to
detect a single neutron, the key sign indicating a fusion process is
occurring. It also found no heat produced.
   Williams told the British Broadcasting Corp: ``We've used three
different types of heat-flow instrument, we've used all sorts of
different types of neutron counters, we've used them upside down,
inside out, changed the solution. We've checked, we've calibrated:
everything.''
   ``We're very disappointed. This would have been a very
significant discovery,'' he said.

   The Agriculture Department has a new list of
experts who can help new and veteran small-scale farmers find just
the right information about raising game birds, exotic herbs and
hundreds of other specialties.
   It's a 109-page soft-cover book _ The Directory for Small-Scale
Agriculture _ which its chief promoter says will be ``a handy tool''
for anyone seeking to establish a small farm or improve the
operation of an existing acreage.
   Howard W. (Bud) Kerr Jr., director of the department's Office for
Small-Scale Agriculture, said Thursday that the publication is ``not
only for those who have the acreage but for those who are
contemplating getting into the ownership of a small parcel of
ground.''
   Kerr added in an interview: ``They have dreams, they have
visions. They don't know how to network, how to reach the right
source of information.''
   The book tells how to trace subject matter to hundreds of sources
listed alphabetically, with addresses, telephone numbers and
specialties. Kerr said a user with questions can ``go to the horse's
mouth for an answer.''
   For example, someone in Georgia (or elsewhere, for that matter)
might want to know about short-stake tomatoes, peppers and cole
crops. There's an address and phone number for an expert at the
University of Georgia.
   What about greenhouse production of European cucumbers, or
perhaps khigh bush and rabbit eye blueberries? There's a listing for
someone at USDA's South Central Family Farm Research Center,
Booneville, Ark.
   The latest in research on fresh market vegetables in New
Hampshire? Plant scientists at the University of New Hampshire,
Durham, will be able to help.
   And if a Virginia broccoli growers has problems with club root
disease, perhaps a call to Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State
University, Blacksburg, could help.
   Kerr said the directory is a pioneer effort for his office, which
is part of the department's Cooperative State Research Service, an
agency that has close working ties with land-grant and other state
institutions.
   In a statement included in the directory, Kerr said the intent is
to ``link the vast network of people in the vast federal and state
systems'' with others who work the nation's small farms.
   ``Seven out of every 10 family farms in America are small-scale
farms grossing $40,000 a year or less,'' he said. ``Apart from
production, these small-scale farms also contribute to the
preservation of the environment, the stability of the community
structure which maintains a varied landscape for people to live, and
the supply of agricultural materials for food and industrial
purposes.''
   Kerr said the book can be ordered from: Superintendent of
Documents, Government Printing Office, North Capitol Street NW,
Washington, D.C. 20402. Refer to stock number 001-000-04539. Or
telephone 202 783-3238. The cost is $5.50 per volume; foreign orders
are $6.88 each.

   Agriculture Department economists are
forecasting a significant rise this summer in broiler production.
   Over all of 1989, broiler output is expected to rise 5 percent
from last year, when production was up 4 percent from 1987.
   However, the department's Economic Research Service said broiler
production in the first quarter of this year rose only 3 percent,
compared with a 7 percent gain during January, February and March of
1988.
   Thus, the agency said in the June issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, broiler output in the second quarter probably will be up 4
percent from a year earlier, while third-quarter production may gain
7 percent.
   Analysts said the production increase is being fed by ``high
prices and lower feed costs'' and that net returns to broiler
producers have been on the plus side for a year.
   Broiler wholesale prices based on a composite city market
averaged almost 64 cents per pound in April, well above the 49 cents
of a year earlier, the report said. The average in the first three
months was 59 cents.
   ``With higher summer demand for broilers and tighter second-half
beef supplies, wholesale prices may average 68 to 70 cents for the
second quarter and 65 to 71 cents for the third,'' the report said.

   The Agriculture Department says it has found no
significant environmental impact from field trials of tomatoes
engineered genetically to resist insects.
   The Monsanto Co., Chesterfield, Mo., is conducting the field test
in Hughson, Calif., the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service said Thursday.
   Scientists used a delta endotoxin gene found naturally in the
bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis, which is toxic to certain
destructive caterpillars. Monsanto is also testing the experimental
tomatoes in Florida and Illinois.

   American Honda Motor Co. Inc. has recalled about
77,000 1988 Prelude automobiles to eliminate potential accelerator
pedal and front-seat problems.
   The company said in a news release received Thursday that rubber
blocks would be installed under accelerator pedals in all 77,000
Preludes. Under extreme pressure, the pedal could be caught by a
stopper covered by floor material.
   Also, the company said it would reinforce front-seat anchors that
don't meet federal strength specifications in about 25,000 of the
cars. All work would be done at no cost to the consumer, Honda said.

   Mazda Motor Corp.'s new two-seat
convertible is being billed as a sports car for the masses.
   The Japanese automaker introduced the car Thursday, saying its
base price of $13,800 leaves it alone in a segment of the market
that had been populated by the Pontiac Fiero and other cars not so
long ago.
   Mazda is counting on consumers to make the distinction between a
sports car, which its new Miata MX-5 is, and a ``sporty'' car, like
the RX-7 or Nissan's 300ZX or 200SX.
   ``It's our belief that many of those sporty-car buyers would like
a sports car,'' said George McCabe, vice president for sales of
Mazda Motor of America Inc. ``It's a sports car for the masses.''
   Prices for ``sporty'' cars have been pushed into the $20,000
range because of currency exchange rates and the addition of an
array of electronic gadgetry, leaving a gap in the market at the
lower end.
   Options on the Miata could push it into the $16,000 range,
officials said.
   Mazda began full-scale development of a two-seat car without a
lot of the electronic additions on the more-expensive models in
1986. Development costs were held to a modest $100 million because
it shares some features with the Mazda 323.
   Mazda plans limited production of the car. The company expects to
sell about 20,000 during the last half of this year and twice that
many during 1990. The assembly plant in Japan has a
60,000-car-a-year capacity.
   For now, the car is being marketed only in the United States,
with distribution in Japan and Europe possible next year, officials
said.
   The rear-wheel-drive car carries a 116-horsepower, four-cylinder,
1.6-liter engine. And that could pose a problem with insurance
companies, officials said.
   ``It's true that insurance has really impacted the sports car
category in the last couple of years,'' McCabe said at a news
conference. ``We don't expect the insurance companies will view the
Miata in a negative light.''

   The United Auto Workers will gather for their

   Underneath the speeches, political wrangling and hoopla in
Anaheim, Calif., will be rumblings of dissent.
   Union President Owen Bieber, the Administration Caucus he runs
and the union's increasingly cooperative attitude toward management
have been sharply criticized by the New Directions movement,
spearheaded by Jerry Tucker of St. Louis, Mo., and Don Douglas of
Detroit.
   While the two are seeking seats as regional directors, they may
be dark-horse candidates. In local delegate elections, New
Directions candidates in Tucker's and Douglas's regions came up
short.
   Nevertheless, Tucker, who goes into the convention as director of
one of the UAW's largest regions in a position he won through a
federally supervised election last year, has said the New Directions
movement has widespread support, and that could show up in reports
from the convention's credentials and resolutions committees.
   The credentials committee certifies the seating of delegates.
It's possible that challenges could by mounted by New Directions
forces, which have contended that some delegate elections were won
by Administration Caucus supporters through questionable, and in
some cases illegal, means.
   Tucker has asked the union's hierarchy to review some of the
elections and has hinted that lawsuits could be filed over local
delegate elections. After all, Tucker has said in the past, that's
how he was elected director of UAW Region 5 in the first place.
   New Directions supporters also may show up around the middle of
the week-long convention if a resolution surfaces that would seek
delegate endorsement of more UAW representation on automakers'
boards of directors.
   Bieber sits on the board of Chrysler Corp., a position granted
during the early 1980s when the UAW signed concession contracts with
the nation's No. 3 automaker. The Detroit News reported Thursday
that the resolution also would support increased union cooperation
with management.
   Both of the issues are at the core of New Directions' arguments
with Bieber and the Administration Caucus.
   Despite potential challenges, Bieber is virtually assured of
election to a third, three-year term at the head of the huge union,
which during his administration has looked outside the auto industry
for members.
   Joining the traditional delegates from auto factory shop floors
will be representatives of Michigan state workers, clerical workers
from New England colleges and jai alai players.
   Among those addressing the convention are newly elected House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, Sen. Edward Kennedy, former Rep. Barbara Jordan, New York
Gov. Mario Cuomo and NAACP President Benjamin Hooks.

   Stock prices were higher at midday Friday as
investors were relieved that the latest British inflation report
contained little to provoke an immediate hike in interest rates.
   One trader said participants felt a ``modicum of comfort'' after
the data showed a 0.6-percent increase in Britain's retail price
index for May, compared with a 1.8-percent rise in April. This put
the annual inflation rate at 8.3 percent.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was
up 9.4 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,139.0.
   Turnover at midday registered 273.2 million shares.
   Traders said the market headed higher from the outset, bolstered
by sterling's renewed strength and a perception that the pressure on
an imminent rise in interest rates had eased.

<HEAD>New Teflon Designed for High-Tech Uses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. has developed a new version
of its familiar Teflon frypan coating for computers, fiber optics
and other high technology uses.
   Teflon AF is a descendent of the non-stick substance that was
discovered 51 years ago, specialty business director David C.
Sanders said Thursday.
   The AF stands for amorphous fluoropolymers, the chemical compound
that is credited with making the new product an improvement over the
stuff that is best known for keeping food from sticking to pots and
pans.
   ``This product is a quantum leap forward in polymer technology.
It is designed specifically for advanced, high technology
applications and can be tailored for many high performance uses,''
said Thomas R. Darling, Du Pont venture manager for Teflon AF.
   With performance characteristics that far exceed ordinary Teflon,
the new product is expected to meet design engineers' material needs
in a variety of high technology areas, including high-speed computer
circuitry, the company said in a statement.
   Du Pont has targeted several markets for the new product,
including aerospace, automotive, aircraft, biomedical, specialized
chemical handling and possible petroleum exploration, Darling said.
   ``We view this as a complimentary addition to the Teflon product
line. It's not likely it will compete with markets Teflon now
serves. It will open up new markets for this particular type of
Teflon and it tends to be in areas of fairly high technology,''
Darling said.
   He said the new Teflon is soluble, unlike the original, solid
version. It has electrical properties that are expected to be ideal
for high-speed advanced generation computers and other high
technology needs of the 21st century.
   The company said the new product can also function in severe
temperatures and can be used in such chemical applications as
semiconductor processing.
   Darling said more uses for the new product are sure to be
discovered over the years.
   ``I do expect this will have a long and healthy life. It has
performance features new to the Teflon current family and over the
long term we will continue to find uses for it as they have'' for
the older version, Darling said. ``Du Pont technology can help
customize and tailor the material to meet specific, and as yet
unknown, needs.''
   The company has built a Teflon AF plant in Fayetteville, N.C.,
which is expected to begin operations at the end of July or in early
August, Darling said.
   The original Teflon was discovered accidentally April 6, 1938, by
a young chemist named Roy J. Plunkett.
   In addition to cookware, it coats chemical tanks, jogging suits
and lightbulbs.
   Its greatest commercial use is in wire coating, followed by
gaskets and shaft seals and pipe and tank coatings.

<HEAD>Goldome Rescinds Controversial Severence Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goldome today rescinded its policy of
requiring laid-off workers to sign an agreement promising not to
talk to the media about losing their jobs in order to receive full
severance pay.
   The policy had embittered current and former employees who felt
the company was threatening laid-off workers.
   Goldome Chief Executive Officer Thomas Cooper said, ``Our
intention, to help assure the confidentiality of employee, customer
and corporate information ... has been submerged by misperceptions
of the agreement. This makes its continued use counterproductive.''
   As many as 150 people had been terminated in recent weeks and
asked to sign the ``Release and Confidentiality Agreement,'' which
prevented them from suing Goldome or discussing their layoff with
anyone except ``counsel, personal tax adviser, immediate family or
as required by law.''
   If laid-off employees refused to sign, their severance benefits
would have been cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six.
   Sources within the company said management thought news of
Goldome's layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from the
bank.
   Although many companies require new employees to sign
confidentiality agreements, it is highly unusual for a company to
require terminated employees to sign such an agreement as a
condition of receiving severance pay.
   ``It's not illegal, but I wouldn't consider it morally right,''
said an analyst with Mercer, Meidinger and Hansen, a leading human
resources consulting firm in Washington.
   Nearly all of Goldome's laid-off workers signed the agreement,
sources said.
   The confidentiality requirement came after the company reduced
its severance policy May 1. Companies are not required by law to
provide any severance pay, but most offer it as part of a benefits
package to attract qualified employees and as a humanitarian gesture.
   Goldome, which lost $119 million last year, is in the middle of a
restructuring effort.

   CHICAG0 (AP) _ Kraft's efforts to appease winners in its botched
``Ready to Roll'' game aren't winning over everybody.
   ``I don't mean to sound greedy, but the settlement offer is kind
of skimpy and it's a far cry from what was being offered,'' says
Larry Bernstein, who matched game pieces for a $17,000 van.
   Bernstein was one of an estimated several hundred people who
matched game pieces for a Dodge Caravan in a contest designed to
have only one van winner. Kraft on Thursday offered those winners
$250 and a special drawing for four vans.
   ``I'm not really too pleased,'' he said. ``You're talking $17,000
versus $250. I suspect lots of people will want to go ahead with the
lawsuits.''
   At least three class-action lawsuits have been filed against the
company.
   The suburban Chicago-based company, known formally as Kraft
General Foods Group of Philip Morris Cos., also offered to make up
for the mistake by quadrupling the number of prizes and giving away
cash to all winners.
   Kraft told the Sun-Times the mistake was made by the unidentified
companies that prepared the game, not Kraft.
   ``There was a mistake, obviously, but it was clearly
unintentional,'' said Mitch Weinick, president of Refrigerated
Products for Kraft USA. ``Because our customers are so good-natured
and good-humored, we're trying to do right by them.''
   The promotion was run only in the Chicago and Houston
metropolitan areas. The contest required consumers to match left
halves of a pictured van contained in specially marked packages of
Kraft Singles cheese with right halves appearing in coupons in
Sunday newspaper advertisements.
   Bernstein wasn't the only one balking at the deal.
   ``I look at it this way,'' said Sharon LaMont, who also had
matched game pieces for a van. ``If they had cheese on sale for
$1.39 and I offered to buy it for 14 cents, do you think they'd let
me have it?''
   The Skokie resident joined one of the class-action lawsuits.
   ``We have five secretaries just taking the calls,'' said attorney
Burton Weinstein, who filed a lawsuit. He said his firm is
representing at least 300 people.
   Diana Redmond, a Rockford resident who hasn't decided whether to
join the lawsuit, said a drawing that included everyone who matched
game pieces for the van wouldn't be fair.
   ``I'm one of the people who followed instructions specifically
and put the entry in the mail on Monday. I feel I should have a
little better chance.
   ``Instead,'' she said, ``they're giving a lot of
Johnny-come-latelies ... the people who started scrounging through
their garbage after they read about this, the same chance as me to
win.''
   In separate negotiations with Illinois and Texas officials, Kraft
entered into voluntary compliance agreements that, in effect, free
the company from charges of violating consumer laws in its ``Ready
to Roll'' game. Under the agreements, Kraft is voluntarily offering
the extra contest payments and holding the alternative drawing.
   Investigators ``have found no ground to suggest that there was
any effort to deceive or otherwise violate any consumer protection
law,'' said Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan.
   Kraft said virtually every package of cheese contained a game
piece that matched the pieces found in Sunday newspaper inserts.
   After hundreds of people called Sunday night to claim they'd won
the grand prize, Kraft declared the contest null and void. The
company also pulled packages of the cheese slices from grocery store
shelves.
   Kraft spokesman Mike Caruso said the company's attorneys believe
it's not liable for the prizes because ``of the nature of the
mistake. It was appropriately revoked.''
   In addition to the van, Kraft had planned to award 100 bicycles,
500 skateboards and 8,000 packages of cheese.
   The company said in addition to the $250 cash prizes for those
who matched game pieces for the van, it would award $50 to bicycle
winners, $25 to skateboard winners and $5 to cheese winners. The
drawing for the vans was set for July 14.
   Only one winner will be allowed per household. The deadline for
submitting winning entries is midnight Friday.

   Stock market trading got off to a powerful start
today and share prices were mixed.
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange surged to 107.85 million
shares in the first 30 minutes of trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 6.16 to 2,481.16
by 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced advances on the Big Board, with 561
down, 359 up and 499 unchanged. The NYSE composite index of all its
listed common stocks was unchanged at 178.97.
   Investment analysts attributed the unusually heavy trading volume
on Wall Street to manuevers associated with the expiration of
stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
This ``triple witching hour'' takes place once a quarter.
   The June contract on Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index ceased
trading on Thursday and settled based on today's opening stock
market prices. The S&amp;P 500-stock index futures is the most heavily
traded contract of its kind.
   Reports on inflation and the housing industry went largely
ignored in the early crush of business.
   The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose a sharp
0.6 percent in May, pushed up by strong increases in food and
gasoline costs. Last month's rise, close to analysts' estimates,
followed a 0.7 percent April increase.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said housing construction
continued to decline in May and starts on new homes fell 2.1 percent
from the previous month to the lowest level since the last recession
in 1982.
   In the early going, Eastman Kodak rose \ to 49. The company said
it is consolidating some operations which could cause the
elimination of some jobs.
   Exxon led the list of actively trading NYSE issues, rising [ to
43~.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 28.36 to
2,475.00.
   The NYSE's composite index fell 1.86 to 178.97.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with 1,078
down, 444 up and 466 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 179.48 million shares, against 170.54
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>China's Credit Could Weaken, Hurting Its Ability to Finance Growth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's credit ratings are at risk due to its
political upheaval, and the nation may face increased difficulty
raising money in world financial markets for economic development
projects, experts say.
   Moody's Investors Service recently put its ratings of Chinese
bonds on review for a possible downgrade. Japan's credit-rating
agencies also said they are re-examining their assessment of China's
debt.
   Should the credit-rating companies lower their ratings, China may
have to pay a higher interest rate on future bond issues.
   The price of existing Chinese bonds has plunged on European
markets in reaction to the government's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators. China has more than $1 billion worth of bonds in
circulation on the Euromarkets.
   In addition, the turmoil has delayed a new $100 million bond
offering in Japan by one of China's provincial development
corporations, stalled a $120 billion Japanese bank loan to a Chinese
petrochemical company, and held up a $60 billion agricultural loan
from the World Bank.
   Analysts say it's too soon to say what lasting impact the
upheaval may have on China's ability to borrow overseas from
commerical and governmental sources. But many believe damage has
been done, no matter what the outcome of the nation's power struggle.
   ``It's already going to be marginally more expensive (for China
to borrow), but the question is, how much higher,'' said Rick
Harbaugh, an analyst for the WEFA Group, a financial forecasting
firm.
   Harbaugh said he believes China increasingly will rely on its $19
billion in foreign reserves this year for funding instead of foreign
debt. These reserves consist of convertible currencies, such as
dollars, pounds and yen, held by the Chinese central bank.
   WEFA recently released a grim forecast for China's economy for
the rest of the year. It said production of goods has faltered, and
the confidence of foreigners who invest in China has been shaken.
   China's reliance on foreign finance has grown as its free-market
economic system has expanded. The nation has about $40 billion in
outside credit from all sources, according to Moody's and WEFA.
   Of that, about $12 billion is government debt, either in direct
loans from other nations or from governmental bodies such as the
World Bank, said Stephen Taran, Moody's China analyst.
   The rest, about $28 billion, is commercial debt, he said. This
includes about $6 billion in bonds, with the remainder in bank loans
and credits from foreign companies that sell goods to China on
credit.
   China has floated most of its bonds on Asian exchanges. No bonds
have been sold in the United States.
   Moody's has given the Chinese bonds it rates a rank of A-3, which
it considers a ``middle-high'' rating on its scale of Aaa to C.
   When Moody's originally rated the bonds, ``we made some
judgements about the possible range of political instability that
might take place in China,'' said David Levey, another Moody's
analyst.
   Under the re-evaluation, he said, the company will look again at
all the factors that it took into account for the original rating to
see what has changed.
   Among these factors is China's economy and whether the Chinese
government has lost some element of its long-term support among the
population, he said. But undertaking the re-evaluation won't be
easy, he said.
   ``Lots of things we would like to know are shrouded in secrecy
and obscurity,'' he said.
   Another bond-rating service, Standard &amp; Poors Corp., hasn't
formally rated China's debt. But it said in a statement last week
that despite the recent turmoil, it considers China's ability to
meet debt obligations on time as ``satisfactory but vulnerable to
adverse developments.''
   ``China's strong export growth, balanced current account, modest
external debt burden and large international reserves continue to
provide ample ability to service foreign debt,'' S&amp;P said.
   No matter what the outcome of the review of China's debt, an
executive at a major Wall Street investment house said her company
hasn't put much faith in the ratings.
   ``We think the ratings do not take sufficient account of the
political risk in China, and we think events bore us out,'' she
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Harbaugh, the WEFA analyst, also advised traders in Chinese bonds
to be cautious. ``I think they should certainly be skeptical, but I
think probably things will work out,'' he said.

   Troubled Coleco Industries Inc. has agreed
to sell most of its assets to Hasbro Inc. for $85 million in cash, a
deal analysts said means the demise of the toymaker that introduced
the hottest-selling toy in U.S. history, the Cabbage Patch doll.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said Paul Valentine, a toy analyst with New York-based
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, Avon-based Coleco, now
operating under Bankruptcy Court protection, also will receive
warrants to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro stock.
   Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro, the largest U.S. toymaker, will
receive Coleco's product line, which includes the Scrabble and
Parcheesi board games as well as the Cabbage Patch dolls, Coleco
Chairman Morton Handel said.
   In addition to buying inventory and the equipment to make the
products, Hasbro will buy certain accounts receivable, Handel said.
   Coleco will retain all of its cash assets and certain real estate
that it will convert to cash, Handel said. At the completion of the
transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million in cash _ the
$85 million from Hasbro and about $65 million Coleco had in the
banks in mid-March, Handel said.
   The cash will be used to pay off the company's debt, he said.
When Coleco filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, it listed
debt of $540.3 million.
   The agreement still must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
Handel said. The deal is also subject to the approval of Original
Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and Coleco
directors.
   If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's remaining 250 employees
are expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by Hasbro,
Handel said.
   ``Coleco was pretty much the victim of its own success,'' said
David Leibowitz, senior vice president of New York-based American
Securities Corp. ``Cabbage Patch in 1985 was the largest single
selling toy of all time, selling $600 million-plus at wholesale.''
   The success of the homely Cabbage Patch dolls forced Coleco to
expand, borrowing money to do so, he said. When Cabbage Patch Kids
sales tumbled and new products _ including the Adam home computer
and toys based on Rambo movies _ did not sell, the company could not
pay off the new debts, he said.
   Valentine said Arnold Greenberg, the former Coleco chairman,
managed the company too aggressively without focusing on cost
controls.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' Valentine said. But, he added, it was Greenberg who
transformed Coleco into a major company.
   Greenberg's Russian immigrant father, Maurice Greenberg, founded
the company as the Connecticut Leather Co. in Hartford in 1932,
selling leather and shoe heels and soles. The company expanded into
toys in 1954.
   Arnold Greenberg joined Coleco full time in 1966. He bought the
license to the Cabbage Patch Kids in 1982 after several major toy
companies turned down the dolls, which were designed with their own
set of adoption papers.
   For growing Hasbro, which in the last decade has bought such
big-name toymakers as Milton Bradley Co. and introduced a steady
stream of new products, the deal means yet another line of toys.
   Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and
the Transformers, had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from just
$104.3 million in 1980.
   ``Under Hasbro, I think Cabbage Patch will grow substantially
over the next few years,'' Valentine said. ``Even Barbie has her ups
and downs. The Cabbage Patch Kids won't wilt forever.''

<HEAD>Gallo Pulls High-Alcohol Wines From San Francisco's Seedy Tenderloin
District</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The E.&amp; J. Gallo Winery, responding to
activists' demands, says it will pull two brands of high-alcohol
wine from store shelves in the city's seedy Tenderloin neighborhood
in a six-month experiment.
   The Modesto-based Gallo, the world's largest winery, said if the
removal of the offending wines succeeds in reducing alcoholism in
the area, the company will pull its Thunderbird and Night Train
Express brands in other neighborhoods.
   The company has never removed a product from the shelves before,
said Gallo spokesman Dan Solomon.
   The action came Wednesday after Tenderloin area distributor
Gallo-Bay Cities, a Gallo-owned business, met with a group called
Safe and Sober Streets, which recently kicked off a public protest
of high-alcohol brands in their district. Canandaigua's Wild Irish
Rose was also singled out, as well as the two Gallo brands.
   The protesters said they couldn't walk the streets of the
Tenderloin without tripping over or being menaced by apparent
alcoholics.
   Gallo, a privately held company, has $1 billion in annual sales
and 28 percent of the U.S. wine market.
   The Sober Streets group went from store to store to ask
proprietors to take the cheap wines off their shelves. One grocer
said he resumed selling the wine after he lost $850 in sales in a
single day.
   Solomon characterized the action as an experiment by the Gallo
organization to test the premise that alcoholics deprived of their
cheap wine will turn to other types of alcohol.
   ``We believe, and the evidence tends to support, that if
alcoholics are deprived of one source, be it beer, wine or cheap
distilled spirits, they will find another, regardless of difficulty
or cost,'' he said.
   ``If what we have done in this neighborhood improves the
alcoholism problem in this area, we'll do the same thing in other
neighborhoods,'' he said.
   Solomon refused to say whether he meant San Francisco, California
or the entire country.
   The high-alcohol wines are typically made from the cheapest
vinous ingredients with a hint of grape flavor, then mixed with
grape brandy to bring the mixture to about 18 percent alcohol by
volume. Regular table wine is about 12 percent. The high-alcohol
wines sell for about 90 cents to $1.25 a bottle, or fifth of a
gallon.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain On Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were slightly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
growing confidence among traders that the Midwestern weather is due
for a change.
   Forecasters continued to predict hot, dry conditions in the Corn
Belt by late next week, and some traders were even beginning to take
a bullish view of the dampness that has prevailed in the region this
week.
   ``Crop development is being impeded by this cold, wet weather,''
said Gerald Zusel, manager of Board of Trade floor operations for
Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Temperatures dropped so low Thursday that some frost damage to
corn was reported in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota, but crop
losses were not extensive.
   The advancing winter wheat harvest kept a lid on early gains in
the wheat market.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 2 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.95} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 2{ cents higher with July at $2.61} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents
to 1{ cents higher wiith July at $1.67} a bushel; soybeans were 3{
cents to 6 cents higher with July at $7.37{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 71.82
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .18 ent higher
with August at 81.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent to .50

<HEAD>Records Indicate Rockwell Workers Overexposed To Radiation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of workers at two Rockwell
International facilities in Southern California were exposed to
excessive levels of radiation in the 1960s, federal documents show.
   No overexposures were shown for subsequent years.
   The documents, released Thursday by the Department of Energy
under the Freedom of Information Act, exclude two overexposure
incidents Rockwell officials have confirmed took place in the 1970s
and '80s.
   Also omitted from the records were the settlements Rockwell paid
recently in at least three workers compensation cases involving
cancer deaths allegedly caused by radiation exposure. Rockwell
didn't admit liability when it paid the settlements in 1987-88.
   The released documents are called unusual occurrence reports. The
Energy Department requires contractors such as Rockwell to file such
reports after safety or equipment problems.
   ``We fully recognize we have a very serious responsibility to the
public, and that's why we monitor our activities so closely,'' said
Pat Coulter, spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division. ``That's
why when there is a deviance, we record it and make sure it doesn't
happen again.''
   Most of the unusual occurrence reports described minor equipment
malfunctions that apparently didn't involve worker or environmental
safety.
   The two facilities, one in the Canoga Park area and the other the
company's Santa Susana Field Laboratory in the hills bordering Los
Angeles and Ventura counties, have worked for more than 30 years for
the energy and weapons programs of the Energy Department and its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission.
   Workers during several episodes between 1960 and 1967 were
exposed to higher-than-acceptable limits of rems per year at the two
plants, according to the documents. Allowable limits, measured by
film badges worn by workers, are three rems per calendar quarter or
five rems per year.
   A report, for example, on a 1961 incident shows that an employee
was assigned to work in a nuclear reactor room although his
quarterly exposure was already near the 3 rem limit, prompting his
dose to rise to 3.455 rem.
   Five rems is equivalent to between 100 to 200 chest X-rays or
about 50 times the natural background radiation from the sun, rocks
and soil.
   Experts say five rems isn't considered a high radiation dose, but
warned a worker exposed to that level for 30 years has up to three
extra chances in 100 of dying of cancer.

   Most employers should be required to provide
health insurance, according to polls of doctors and the public, but
a manufacturing group is worried about the cost.
   ``The cost of health care for American business has tripled over
the past eight years,'' said Laura Brown, a spokeswoman for the
National Association of Manufacturers. ``We haven't seen parallel
improvements in quality.''
   Mandated coverage, she said, would only worsen an ``enormous''
financial drain on revenues that could otherwise go for capital
improvements, worker training and industrial technology.
   A poll, published in today's issue of American Medical News, said
that 57 percent of the public and 34 percent of doctors questioned
believed all employers should be required to provide
health-insurance coverage.
   An additional 22 percent of the public and 36 percent of the
physicians surveyed believed that coverage should be required in
most cases, but that small businesses and part-time employees should
be exempt.
   Only 19 percent of the public and 27 percent of the physicians
said the government should not mandate coverage; 3 percent in both
surveys were undecided, the report said.
   The Gallup Organization conducted the polls for the American
Medical Association, whose House of Delegates meets here for its
annual policy meeting next week.
   The polls did not specify whether employers would pay the full
cost.
   More than 35 million Americans lack health insurance, according
to some estimates, and AMA trustees in March said the government
should require that all employers gradually provide health insurance
for full-time employees.
   A bill sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. to mandate
coverage for employees who work more than 17{ hours a week and their
dependents is before a Senate committee. The bill applies to all
businesses, but contains a clause under which small companies could
get government subsidies.
   Gallup questioned 1,500 randomly selected U.S. adults via
telephone during late January and early February, with a sampling
error estimated at 2.5 percentage points.
   For the doctors' poll, Gallup queried 1,004 U.S. physicians from
the AMA's list in late January and early February. The margin of
error is calculated at 3.5 percentage points.
   American Medical News is the weekly newspaper of the
Chicago-based American Medical Association.

   The stock market was mixed late this morning and
the pace of activity eased after a powerful trading surge in the
early going.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.29 to 2,479.29 by
noon on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced advances on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 656 down, 570 up and 571 unchanged. The NYSE
composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.07 to
179.04.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 155.33 million shares at midday,
up from 84.31 million shares at the same point in the previous
session.
   Stock trading got off to a brisk start before settling down; more
than 107 million shares changed hands in the first half hour of
trading.
   Investment analysts attributed the unusually heavy trading volume
on Wall Street to manuevers associated with the expiration of
stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.
This occurence commonly called the ``triple witching hour'' takes
place once a quarter.
   Reports on inflation and the housing industry had little impact
on stocks.
   The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose a sharp
0.6 percent in May, pushed up by strong increases in food and
gasoline costs. Last month's rise, close to analysts' estimates,
followed a 0.7 percent April increase.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing
construction continued to decline in May and starts on new homes
fell 2.1 percent from the previous month to the lowest level since
the last recession in 1982.
   Warner Communications led the list of actively trading NYSE
issues, climbing 3] to 59 on volume of more than 3.9 million shares.
   Time today launched a $70 a share tender offer for Warner and
rejected a $10.7 billion buyout bid from Paramount Communications.
   Time stock fell 5 to 166{ and Paramount was off | at 58~.

   Pan Am Corp. submitted a revised bid for
Northwest Airlines today that includes an additional $200 million in
equity while oil billionaire Marvin Davis said he has revised his
offer for the carrier for the last time.
   Northwest's machinists' union also met today's deadline for
revised offers, the union's president said, but previous bidder MEI
Diversified of Minneapolis said it would not make a new offer.
   Northwest parent NWA Inc. had set today as a deadline for revised
offers after rejecting all offers in the first round of bidding.
   A group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi is the only
other suitor known to have met the initial deadline. Checchi said
today he would not comment on whether the group would submit a new
offer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is an equity partner in the Checchi
group.
   Northwest stock rose 12{ cents to $107.62{ a share today in
mid-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts have
said the winning bid could be as high as $120 a share, but the
company repeatedly has said it may not sell the airline.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said his revised bid for the
nation's fourth-largest airline includes $200 million in equity from
Corporate Partners, an investment fund organized by Lazard Freres &amp;
Co. and managed by Lester Pollack and Ali E. Wambold. That brings
the total amount of equity in the Pan Am proposal to $600 million,
Plaskett said.
   No other details were disclosed, but Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon said the bid still includes bank financing and subordinated
debt placed with private institutions. The earlier Pan Am bid
included $2.7 billion in bank financing.
   ``This new equity has allowed us to make a proposal that is
vigorously competitive and attractive to NWA's shareholders,
employees and others who have a strong stake in Northwest's
long-term future,'' Plaskett said.
   Plaskett said Pan Am met with First Boston, Northwest's financial
adviser, before revising its proposal. He said he believes the new
offer ``addresses the concerns'' NWA had about the original Pan Am
bid. NWA appointed a special committee to review the offers.
   A spokesman for Davis, who opened the bidding for Northwest on
March 28 with an offer of $2.7 billion, or $90 a share, said the oil
mogul has submitted a ``new and very full'' offer.
   ``It's one which he and his advisers believe provides the
greatest value to shareholders while at the same time ensuring that
the company is not overly leveraged,'' the spokesman said. ``This is
Mr. Davis' final bid for the company.''
   Guy Cook, president of the International Association of
Machinists District Lodge 143, said the union has submitted a
revised bid, but he did not disclose details. The machinists' union
accounts for about 20,000 of Northwest's 35,000 employees.
   MEI Diversified, led by Minneapolis banker Carl Pohlad, issued a
statement saying it would not revise its offer. The group includes
Minneapolis financier Irwin Jacobs.
   Two other rumored bidders for NWA _ the New York takeover firms
of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and Forstman, Little &amp; Co. _ have
declined comment.
   The four-member committee of the NWA board announced June 5 that
it had rejected all the first-round bids and asked for ``enhanced''
revisions. It has not identified bids or bidders, but it said it
would favor a high price, a low level of debt and an ability to
complete a deal quickly.
   Analysts expect the special committee to make a decision on the
revised bids next week. The company asked bidders to keep their
offers open through June 30.

<TEXT>
   Investigators have found severe cracks in the
engines of grounded Boeing 737-400s operated by British carriers,
the Times of London reported today.
   The Department of Civil Aviation, which ordered the aircraft
grounded last week, and the Department of Transport said they could
not confirm or deny the report.
   Jack Gamble, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said
the Seattle-based company also could not confirm or deny the report.
   ``We know of some cracking found in suspect engines sent to Paris
for repair, but we can't confirm it,'' he said today.
   The Times said the cracks were more serious than the breaking of
fan blades in two engines, which occurred during two British flights
last week. It said the new cracks have been found on previously
untested engines.
   ``The damage is so fundamental that any hope of getting the
aircraft flying in time for the holiday peak has been dashed,'' said
the report by the newspaper's air correspondent, Harvey Elliott.
   The newspaper said detailed reports on the cracks have been sent
to the French manufacturer, SNECMA, which makes the engines in
conjunction with General Electric under the joint name CFM
International.
   On Monday, the Department of Civil Aviation grounded the 12
British-operated Boeing 737-400 aircraft powered by CFM56-3C engines
after the two incidents on British planes last week.
   In the United States, Boeing Commercial Airplanes and CFM
recommended Tuesday that 737-400s with the -3C engines, and some
other engines that had been operated at high thrust levels, be
grounded for engine modifications. The Federal Aviation
Administration followed with its own grounding order Wednesday.
   The five U.S. planes with affected engines, all operated by
USAir, were back in service Thursday, Gamble said. USAir exchanged
the planes' engines for ones with lesser maximum thrust, he said.
   The other 28 affected 737-400s are all operated by airlines
outside the United States.
   In the British incidents, a Dan-Air 737-400 returned to London's
Gatwick Airport and a British Midlands 737-400 made an emergency
landing at East Midlands Airport after engine vibrations. Both
airlines said the turbofan blades had been damaged.
   In January, a British Midlands Boeing 737-400 crashed near East
Midlands airport, killing 47 people after the pilot reported one
engine failed in flight. The investigation, not yet complete, has
found that the pilot shut down the good engine before trying to land.

   Consumer prices rose a sharp 0.6 percent in
May, pushed up by strong increases in food and gasoline costs, the
government said today.
   The rise in the Consumer Price Index, the government's primary
gauge of inflation at the retail level, followed an even stronger
0.7 percent April increase that was the largest jump in more than
two years, the Labor Department reported.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the price increase
``disappointing'' but said administration officials ``continue to
believe that inflation will remain low and under control.''
   During the first five months of the year, consumer prices rose at
an annual rate of 6.7 percent, a significantly faster pace than the
4.4 percent price increases registered in 1987 and 1988.
   Inflation at the wholesale level has been even stronger, rising
at an annual rate of 9.4 percent so far this year.
   ``Reports of inflation's demise have been grossly exaggerated,''
said economist David Berson of the Federal National Mortgage
Association. ``The core rate doesn't appear to have subsided and,
with the economy running close to full employment, will edge up as
the year the goes on.''
   Despite the persistently strong price increases, some other
analysts believe inflation now may begin to level off and that it
could start to drop again late this year.
   ``It's not a good report, but we can look forward to a plateauing
of this increase,'' said Stacy Kottman, research director at the
Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University. ``In the
last half of 1989, the (inflation) range will come down.''
   Today's report will be closely scrutinized by the Federal Reserve
Board, which last week slightly eased its grip on the money supply
in the belief that the slowing economy will help to tame inflation.
   Analysts believe the central bank will wait for further evidence
that inflation is under control before it eases any more.
   In May, the overall inflation rate was heavily influenced by a
1.6 percent increase in energy costs. These costs had shot up 5.1
percent in April, when there was an all-time record increase in
gasoline prices of 11.4 percent.
   Last month's increase in gasoline costs was a still-strong 3.9
percent, which accounted for about one-fourth of the overall
increase in the CPI for May.
   Food and beverage prices, meanwhile, increased 0.6 percent last
month after rising 0.5 percent in April. The May increase included a
sharp 3.2 percent jump in prices for fruits and vegetables. Beef
prices rose 0.5 percent and poultry prices 3.2 percent.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, other consumer
prices rose 0.5 percent in May, up from a 0.2 percent increase in
April. Many analysts closely watch these figures and believe they
represent the important ``core'' level of inflationary pressures in
the economy.
   In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 1.3
percent in May after rising 0.5 percent a month earlier.
   Average weekly earnings in May, before adjusting for inflation,
were $331.20, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.4
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the
12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 1.9 percent.
   The various May price changes left the overall Consumer Price
Index at 123.8 percent of its 1982-84 base. This means that a
hypothetical selection of goods costing $100 during the base period
would have cost $123.80 last month, 70 cents more than in April.
   The 0.6 percent increase in prices last month was slightly higher
than most analysts had expected. The consensus projection had been
0.5 percent.
   The Labor Department offered these other details of price changes
in May:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Apparel prices increased 0.8 percent after rising 0.3 percent in
April. Smaller-than-usual seasonal price declines for women's and
girls' clothing were largely responsible for the seasonally adjusted
increase.
   _Entertainment costs rose 0.1 percent in May after jumping 0.6
percent in April. Admission charges for movies, theaters, concerts
and sporting events were down.
   _Medical care prices rose 0.7 percent and advanced 7.3 percent
over the past 12 months. Drugs and medical supply costs rose 1.1
percent in May.
   _Transportation costs rose 1 percent in May after shooting up 2.1
percent in April, with both months' figures boosted by the sharp
gasoline price increases.
   Before it moved last week to ease credit, the Federal Reserve
since March 1988 had been pushing interest rates upward in an
attempt to curb inflation by restraining economic growth.
   Signs that the economy is in fact slowing have proliferated in
recent months. Most recently, the Fed reported Thursday that factory
operating rates declined last month and industrial production levels
held steady.
   Economist Maury Harris of PaineWebber Inc. in New York said the
easingof factory use bodes well for slowing inflation because it
reduces the likelihood of production bottlenecks and shortages that
can push up prices.
   ``This is telling us that the economy still has plenty of room to
run and the inflationary pressures are going to be cooling off,''
Harris said. ``It's going to take the pressure off ... inflation.''
   Harris said he expects inflation to drop back down to the 4
percent range in the second half of the year, which should prompt
the Fed to again relax its monetary policy.

<TEXT>
   Britain's annualized inflation rate rose to 8.3
percent in May from 8 percent in April, the government said Friday.
   The latest rate was lower than financial markets had expected but
was higher than the peak of 8 percent that Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson had forecast in March.
   The Department of Employment said its retail price index rose 0.6
percent in May from the previous month.
   The index stood at 115 in May, compared with 114.3 in April and
106.2 in May 1988. The index uses a January 1987 base of 100.
   Market forecasts called for an 8.4-percent annual rate and a 0.7
percent monthly rise.
   Employment Secretary Norman Fowler said that if mortgage interest
payments were excluded the rate of inflation would have been 6
percent in May.
   He said inflation ``is likely to fall back later in the year as a
result of policies already in hand.''
   ``There is continuing evidence that the action taken by the
chancellor is beginning to work,'' Fowler said, pointing to a recent
slowdown in retail sales and consumer borrowing growth as well as
moderation in the rate of increase of producer prices.
   The government has pushed up interest rates 10 times in the last
year to 14 percent from 7.5 percent in an effort to fight resurgent
inflation.
   The annual inflation rate in May 1988 was 4.2 percent.

   General Electric Corp. reached a tentative
agreement Friday with 700 union workers, averting a threatened
strike at three plants, a company official said.
   Details of the three-year agreement with members of Local 241 of
the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers
were not released.
   The workers are employed at GE plants in Camden, Moorestown and
Gibbsboro in southern New Jersey.
   Don Norton, a company spokesman in Valley Forge, Pa., said union
members are to vote Sunday on the agreement.
   Union president Frank Ward had said the union was seeking an 18
percent increase over three years.
   Last Sunday, about 500 union members overwhelmingly rejected
management's latest offer, which included a 2 percent salary
increase over three years and cash incentive bonuses worth $1,200,
officials said.
   The current contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Friday and union
members had planned to strike, Ward said.
   The union represents technical engineers, laboratory personnel,
writers and illustrators. The average salary is about $25,000, Ward
said.

   Stock prices move higher Friday after a rebound in
the value of the British pound.
   Traders also were relieved that British inflation was in line
with expectations at 8.3 percent in May.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 14.3
points, or 0.7 percent, higher at 2,143.9, its peak for the day. The
day's low came at the opening, when the index was down 5.5 points.
   Volume was 513.8 million shares, compared with 593.4 million
Thursday.
   Some selective buying at the outset of a new two-week trading
account also helped boost prices late in the day. London's stock
exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week trading
periods for accounting purposes.
   The pounds's performance against the dollar was the major source
of encouragement for the market, which has been plagued recently by
worries that British interest rates might be pushed higher to
bolster the pound.
   The pound was quoted late in the day at $1.5340 up from $1.5195
late Thursday.

   A civil trial is to begin Monday on Home
Shopping Network's $1.5 billion lawsuit alleging that faulty GTE
Corp. equipment kept thousands of customers on hold waiting for idle
sales operators.
   The trial in Pinellas Circuit Court also includes Stamford,
Conn.-based GTE's countering slander suit against the video
retailer. The case is expected to last six weeks.
   Home Shopping Network sued GTE; a subsidiary; and GTE Florida,
the local telephone company in 1987 alleging fraud linked to
telephone equipment. The St. Petersburg-based video retailer is
seeking $500 million in damages and $1 billion in punitive damages.
   The newtork claims it lost $500 million in revenue because GTE
telephone equipment kept thousands of customers waiting for sales
operators who weren't busy.
   The GTE companies have denied wrongdoing and sued alleging
slander and libel. They claim Home Shopping is blaming the
telecommunications companies for its own managerial problems.
   The 12 counts in the original Home Shopping complaint have been
reduced to four _ fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of
trust and confidence, and breach of fiduciary duty.
   Home Shopping maintains that GTE employees lied to the cable
television retailer and installed malfunctioning equipment and later
covered up the problems.

   More than 10,000 coal miners in four
states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in
Virginia and West Virginia who have waged a bitter strike since
April against the Pittston Coal Group.
   Miners in Pennsylvania and Kentucky today became the third and
fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies. The sympathy
strikes began Monday in West Virginia and spread to Indiana late
Thursday.
   One United Mine Workers representative said today that the
Indiana walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of CBS'
``48 Hours,'' which focused on the Pittston strike, in which 1,600
miners have been off the job since April.
   Pittston dropped out of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association
to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have
failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
   UMW officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are
responsible for the wildcat strike. Some said they are asking union
members to return to work, but Tommy Buchanan, international
executive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham, Ala., said
today the final decision on whether 5,000 Alabama miners will join
the strike will be with union President Richard Trumka.
   ``It might be two days. It might be a week. It will start
whenever it comes down from the union president,'' Buchanan said.
   Union spokesman Joe Corcoran was not in his office and has not
returned phone calls this week.
   The head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no
plans to confer with the Pittston on the wildcat strikes.
   ``I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their
company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to
run my company,'' said Robert H. Quenon, president of Peabody
Holding Co., the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of the
Bituminous Coal Operators Association.
   Quenon flew to Charleston from St. Louis on Thursday to meet with
reporters and express Peabody's and the association's concerns about
the walkout.
   An estimated 2,300 United Mine Workers members stayed away from
their jobs today in Pennsylvania. Most worked for Rochester &amp;
Pittsburgh Coal Co. operations in central Pennsylvania, where 1,600
miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said company
spokesman Hank Waneck said.
   About 290 miners at Peabody's Camp No. 1 mine in Morganfield,
Ky., didn't report for work today, said company spokesman Tom Clarke.
   At least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in Indiana
today, spokesmen said. Mark Arnold, a spokesman for UMW District 11
in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show.
   ``When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them off
to where they decided to walk out,'' he said.
   About one-third of West Virginia's 24,000 miners were reported
off the job today. Some 600 miners in Wise County, Va., who walked
out earlier in the week returned to work this morning.
   The coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than
Pittston violate a no-strike clause in the 1988 national contract
the union signed with the association. Pittston did not take part in
that agreement.
   Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in
the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout.
   ``I think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership
role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work,'' Quenon
said. ``That's why we have a union. That's why we have an agreement
with the union _ to set out the terms and conditions under which we
will have labor to run our coal mines.
   ``And we expect that to be honored.''

   The stock market remained mixed this afternoon as
traders awaited an expected surge in activity later today due to the
expiration of various futures and options.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.49 to 2,476.49
at 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues outpaced advances on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 731 down, 617 up and 553 unchanged. The NYSE
composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.11 to
178.86.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 184.22 million shares with two
hours left to go, exceeding Thursday's full-day volume of 179.48
million shares.
   Stock trading got off to a brisk start before settling down; more
than 107 million shares changed hands in the first half hour of
trading.
   Another surge in volume is expected to take place as the market
closes.
   Investment analysts attributed the unusually heavy volume on Wall
Street to manuevers associated with the expiration of stock-index
futures, index options and options on individual stocks. This
occurence commonly called the ``triple witching hour'' takes place
once a quarter.
   Reports on inflation and the housing industry had little impact
on stocks.
   The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose a sharp
0.6 percent in May, pushed up by strong increases in food and
gasoline costs. Last month's rise, close to analysts' estimates,
followed a 0.7 percent April increase.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing
construction continued to decline in May and starts on new homes
fell 2.1 percent from the previous month to the lowest level since
the last recession in 1982.
   Warner Communications led the list of actively trading NYSE
issues, climbing 3 to 58| on volume of more than 5.7 million shares.
   Time today said it was launching a $70 a share tender offer for
Warner and rejected a $10.7 billion buyout bid from Paramount
Communications.
   Time stock fell 5\ to 166\ and Paramount was off 1[ at 58].

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Goldome bank on Friday rescinded its
controversial policy of threatening to cut the severance pay of
laid-off workers unless they signed an agreement not to talk about
losing their jobs.
   ``Our intention, to help assure the confidentiality of employee,
customer and corporate information ... has been submerged by
misperceptions of the agreement. This makes its continued use
counterproductive,'' Thomas Cooper, the chief executive, said in a
statement.
   Cooper said Goldome wants to cut staffing levels by 20 percent,
or about 980 jobs nationwide. He said the company has already
completed more than half of the job cuts, either through layoffs,
attrition or the sale of business units.
   Goldome, one of the nation's largest thrifts, has lost $167
million in it last six quarters. Sources within the company said
Cooper wanted to keep the layoffs secret so customers would not lose
confidence and withdraw their money.
   As many as 150 people had been terminated in the last 10 days and
asked to sign the agreement, which prevented them from suing Goldome
or discussing their layoff with anyone except ``counsel, personal
tax adviser, immediate family or as required by law.''
   If laid-off employees refused to sign, their severance benefits
would have been cut to two weeks pay, down from a maximum of six.
   Nearly all of Goldome's laid-off workers signed the agreement
because they could not afford to lose the money, sources said.
   Goldome, based in Buffalo, employs 4,900 nationwide and has
operations in two dozen states.

   A former stockbroker has been charged with
conspiracy and fraud in a 122-count federal indictment that accused
him of using insider information to reap more than $230,000 in stock
trading profits.
   Danny Omar Cherif, 35, of Aurora also was charged Thursday with
multiple counts of unauthorized entry to a bank and one count each
of perjury and obstruction of justice.
   Cherif, who worked at the First National Bank of Chicago from
1979 until 1987, used his access card to enter the bank without
authorization 32 times after he was fired as an assistant vice
president in the international banking department, Assistant U.S.
Attorney James Conway contends.
   While in the bank mainly during weekends and late evenings,
Cherif obtained sensitive information on mergers, acquisitions or
buyouts the bank was involved in, Conway contends. He then traded
stocks based on the information.
   William Bronec Jr., 36, of Riverside, an associate of Cherif who
also worked at First National for a time, was charged with one count
of conspiracy.
   Conway says Cherif's relatives and friends including Bronec
earned an additional $200,000 from the scheme.
   Cherif worked as a broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s
Oakbrook Terrace office after he left First National. He was fired
May 21, two days after he was arrested by FBI agents and the case
made public.

   Corn and soybean futures prices posted strong
gains Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by forecasts for
warm, dry weather in the Midwest next week. Wheat futures closed
mixed.
   Meteorologists are continuing to call for a change to warmer and
drier-than-normal conditions in the Corn Belt by late next week,
stirring memories of last year's drought.
   Corn futures also were supported by expectations that the
Agriculture Department will extend certain corn loans to farmers
that would keep some corn in storage that otherwise would move onto
the market.
   The dollar's weakness was another bullish factor, since a weaker
dollar could encourage foreign purchases of U.S. grain.
   ``The soybean complex has been trading with a kind of a wary eye
on that dollar situation,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain-market
analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Improving harvest weather in the Great Plains kept pressure on
wheat prices.
   At the close, wheat was \ cent lower to 3\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.94 a bushel; corn was \ cent to

<HEAD>Attorney Accuses FAA of Shirking on New York Airport Investigation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney representing a fired Eastern Airlines
manager said Friday the Federal Aviation Administration has been lax
in taking action against falsification of records that led to fuel
contamination at New York's LaGuardia Airport.
   Ira J. Furman, an attorney in Woodmere, N.Y., said he represents
a former Eastern maintenance manager at LaGuardia who has talked to
the FAA, the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office about alleged
violations that occurred at least a year ago.
   The former manager, whose was not identified, has said he
initialed documents saying tests were made on jets parked overnight
at LaGuardia when no tests actually were made, Furman said. The
tests are to ensure the plane's fuel does not have too much water in
it. Excess water can damage an engine or cause engine failure.
   ``This is like a whitewash,'' Furman said. ``The FAA should have
shut down operations at LaGuardia.''
   ``It has taken a while for us to look into this case,'' said
Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman in FAA's Eastern District office.
However, she said the delay was ``in the interest of thoroughness.''
   Furman, a deputy director of the National Transportation Safety
Board until 1987, said his client was granted immunity in the case
last September.
   Eastern's maintenance and safety operations have come under
increased scrutiny since the walkout of its Machinists union on
March 4, with regulators trying to determine whether the strike has
led to unsafe practices in Eastern's maintenance.
   Early last month, Eastern surrendered its repair station
certificate at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport
after the FAA determined the carrier failed to properly record and
inspect maintenance work.
   The suspension of the JFK certificate was for actions that
predated the start of the Machinists strike that was joined by
pilots and flight attendants. The walkout virtually grounded
Miami-based Eastern and pushed it into bankruptcy court
reorganization.
   On May 12, the FAA completed a special investigation of
record-keeping at Eastern's maintenance posts in Miami and Atlanta
to determine if violations of record-keeping rules such as those
found at Kennedy were widespread.
   The final report hasn't been submitted to acting FAA
Administrator Robert E. Whittington. But Jack Barker, an FAA
spokesman in Atlanta, said Monday the agency told Eastern informally
that the inspection had revealed no irregularities.
   The former manager at LaGuardia asserted that Eastern's
maintenance department there didn't even have the necessary tools to
conduct the fuel tests and said he sometimes signed documents using
made-up initials for nonexistent managers, Furman said.
   Jim Ashlock, a spokesman for Eastern at its Miami headquarters,
said there are no indications that aircraft safety was compromised
at LaGuardia. He said the airline has cooperated with the FAA in
examining all available records relevant to the manager's
accusations.
   The former Eastern manager said he became concerned after a
superior told him they would not hire a lawyer for him if an
accident occurred as a result of the non-testing. He refused to
falsify any more documents, Furman said. Two weeks later the manager
was fired on what he says are false charges that he smoked marijuana
on the job, Furman said.
   The manager alerted the FAA and the Justice Department about the
allegations in 1987 after losing an arbitration case over his
firing, and has given the FAA tape recordings and written documents,
Furman said.
   The manager ``has put himself on the line,'' the attorney said.
``The FAA had it laid out on a silver platter for them.''
   The FAA's inaction ``calls into question the effectiveness of the
FAA in rooting out problems at Eastern,'' Furman said.
   Since 1983 176 accidents, resulting in 45 deaths, were caused by
excess water in fuel, according to the National Transportation
Safety Board. None involved jets or major commercial carriers.

<HEAD>Court Approves $2.5 Billion for Dalkon Shield Victims</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Guerry in 3rd graf is cq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court Friday approved the
bankruptcy reorganization of A.H. Robins Co., including $2.5 billion
for women who claim they were injured by the company's Dalkon Shield
birth control device sold widely in the 1970s.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld all parts of the
long-awaited restructuring of Robins, which will become a subsidiary
of New York-based American Home Products Corp. in a $700 million
stock swap.
   ``I think it's just tremendous news for all Dalkon Shield
claimants,'' said Guerry Thornton, attorney for the Dalkon Shield
Victims Association in Atlanta. ``It means the decade wait for fair
treatment and vindication of their rights is almost over.''
   Robins, a Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, sought
Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors in August
1985.
   The company faced millions of dollars in damage claims from women
who said they suffered injuries including infections, sterility,
miscarriage and having children born with birth defects caused by
the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device.
   Robins distributed about 4.5 million Dalkon Shields in the United
States and abroad before taking the device off the market in 1974.
Robins paid about $520 million to settle 9,400 of some 15,000 Dalkon
Shield lawsuits before seeking bankruptcy protection.
   Alan B. Morrison, attorney for the Public Citizen Litigation
Group in Washington, D.C., lead lawyer for opponents of the
reorganization plan, said no decision had been made whether to
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In a series of four unanimous opinions, a three-judge panel of
the appeals court upheld the entire scope of Robins' reorganization.
   In addition to a $2.5 billion settlement trust fund for about
200,000 Dalkon Shield claimants, the reorganization includes full
payment to Robins' other creditors.
   The restructuring was designed over three years and approved in
July 1988 by U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. and U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell N. Shelley, who presided jointly in the
case.
   The ruling includes approval of a one claimant-one vote plan by
which 95 percent of Dalkon Shield claimants ratified the settlement,
and a separate cash settlement by Robins' insurance company.
   Lawyers for a group of claimants who opposed the plan contended
that ratification vote Dalkon Shield users was flawed. They argued
before the appeals court in December that women with larger claims
should have had a greater voice in deciding the issue.
   The reorganization plan also bars claimants from filing
third-party lawsuits to seek damages from Robins' officers or its
insurer, another aspect opposed by some claimants.
   Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., Robins' insurer, paid $425 million
to the trust to settle any claims against it. The claimants
contended Aetna was an active participant in marketing the Dalkon
Shield and should have been liable for claims beyond those covered
by the $2.5 billion trust.
   But the three-member appeals court panel rejected the argument,
citing the likelihood of conflicting decisions on liability if Aetna
had to face trial in different courts on essentially the same
question.
   The court also ruled that while the one claimant-one vote method
of approving the reorganization denied weighted voting, ``at most,
harmless error was committed'' because almost 95 percent of
claimants endorsed the plan.
   Based on expert testimony, $2.5 billion was the estimated cost of
full compensation for all Dalkon Shield claimants, Robins attorney
James C. Roberts said.
   Only $100 million of the $2.5 billion compensation package to
Dalkon Shield claimants has been available during the appeal.
   Michael Sheppard, director of the trust fund's claims resolution
facility, said $52 million of the initial $100 million already has
been paid to 77,662 claimants.
   Also at issue on appeal was whether Judge Merhige interfered with
the five-member trustee board handling the claimants' compensation
fund.
   Last November, Merhige removed three of the trustees because of
slow progress in setting up a procedure for resolving initial
claims. The appeals court on Friday upheld the judge's action.

   A rally in the dollar fizzled Friday one day
after a sharp sell-off, leaving it higher against the British pound,
Canadian dollar and Swiss franc but lower against other major
currencies.
   The dollar rose from late Thursday levels in Asian and early
European trading despite central banks' dollar sales, but it failed
to hold ground after a U.S. report showed inflation in May at the
high end of expectations.
   Thursday's panicky selling appeared to have altered the bullish
psychology that had carried the dollar to its highest levels since
1987 or late 1986 against some currencies, traders said.
   ``The same inflation number last week would have pushed the
dollar definitely higher,'' said Bernd Becker, chief trader for
Oesterreichische Laenderbank in New York.
   The Commerce Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6
percent in May. High inflation increases the chance the Federal
Reserve will keep interest rates high to keep the economy from
overheating.
   Higher rates attract global money into dollars. But nervous
speculators used the report as an opportunity to sell.
   Also pushing down the dollar, Becker said, was a report out of
Japan quoting sources saying the central banks of Japan and West
Germany had agreed to intervene jointly to hold down the dollar
outside their home markets.
   ``I think the market really got shaken by what happened,'' Becker
said, referring to Thursday's session, in which the dollar lost 2.5
percent or more of its value against the pound, West German mark and
Japanese yen.
   ``Billions of dollars were bought at top levels when it looked
like it was a one-way street up. Now speculators are going to use
any higher levels to sell,'' he said.
   Dealers said trading was erratic, with the dollar's movement
exaggerated by thin volume. Many market players chose to stay on the
sidelines after being burned by Thursday's sharp swings.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5340 to buy one pound, more than $1.5195 late Thursday. In New
York the pound fell to $1.5410 from $1.5510 late Thursday in New
York.
   The dollar fell 6.25 yen to a closing 145.05 yen in Tokyo. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 145.50 yen. In New York the dollar fell
to 144.70 yen from 145.40 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.9810 West German marks, down from
1.9845; 1.7110 Swiss francs, up from 1.7095; 1.1973 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1966; 6.7290 French francs, down from 6.7390; and
1,441 Italian lire, down from 1,443.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.9915 West German marks, down from 2.0235; 1.7213 Swiss francs,
down from 1.7490; 6.7620 French francs, down from 6.8680; 2.2385
Dutch guilders, down from 2.2915; 1,443.50 Italian lire, down from
1,472.00; 1.1973 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1993.
   Gold prices rose overseas, catching up with gains made Thursday
in the United States. But they fell in U.S. trading.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $5.10 a troy ounce to close at a bid
$366.67. Gold rose in London to a late bid of $363.75 from
Thursday's $362.50. In Zurich, gold rose to a bid $363.75 from
$361.71 late Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $365.10 an ounce from $367 on Thursday. Later,
Republic National Bank of New York said gold was bid at $364 as of 4
p.m. EDT, down from $366.80 late Thursday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce, compared with
Thursday's $5.29. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.285 an ounce from $5.309 Thursday.

<HEAD>Kodak Consolidates Divisions, To Cut Hundreds of Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastman Kodak Co. said Friday it will
consolidate its consumer photography products and picture finishing
operations, cutting costs and hundreds of jobs.
   Four operations will be merged in the newly created Consumer
Imagery Division, said company spokesman Paul Allen.
   Kodak said the move would strengthen its consumer photography
business, part of the firm's imaging segment, which made a dismal
showing when Kodak's first-quarter earnings were announced in May.
   By year's end, the new division will include the consumer
products, photofinishing and United States sales divisions, he said.
It also will include the administrative service area within the
photo products group, said Allen.
   ``If you look at the stock over the last couple of weeks, there
has been a lot of speculation after the first-quarter earnings
release... that there could be a major restructuring or a hostile
takeover or spinoff,'' said Alex Henderson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``I am very strongly of the opinion that those basic rumors that
got the stock to rally ... are unfounded.''
   Kodak stock fell 12{ cents Friday to $48.62{ in consolidated New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Kodak profits were down 23 percent in the first quarter and the
company had problems making money selling products overseas, caused
by the increasing strength of the U.S. dollar overseas and foreign
competition. Kodak has also had to absorb costs from last year's
purchase of Sterling Drug Co.
   In the imaging segment, operating earnings fell from $201 million
in last year's first quarter to $160 million the same period this
year.
   Kodak's plan included cutting several hundred jobs from the work
force, but the exact number would not be determined until summer's
end, said Allen.
   The job cuts would occur in support areas and would be primarily
confined to the company's Rochester headquarters, said Allen.
   ``There will be no major impact in the field among our sales
force or at our manufacturing facilities,'' Allen said.
   Kodak Vice Chairman J. Phillip Samper said the company ``will
view consumer photography as single business'' driven by the
recognition that ``consumers see photography as a natural sequence
involving cameras, films and photofinishing.''
   Separately, Xerox Corp. announced in Rochester that 680 employees
nationwide have been accepted in a voluntary reduction program that
Xerox announced in March, including 170 in the Rochester area where
Xerox has its largest manufacturing work force.
   While the voluntary reductions won't guarantee against future
layoffs, said spokesman John Rasor, Xerox had originally predicted
that only 250 to 350 would take advantage of the program.

   Petroleum futures prices fell sharply Friday as
the market relaxed its concerns over supply problems and traders
cashed in gains achieved earlier in the week, analysts said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, finished 62
cents lower at $19.95 a barrel. The drop retraced most of the 69
cents the contract had gained since last Friday's $19.88 close.
   Other contract months showed smaller declines.
   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for July delivery
dropped 1.30 cents to 58.14 cents a gallon, while July heating oil
fell 0.55 cent to 45.71 cents a gallon. Other product contracts also
declined.
   Analysts said the market had been overbought in recent days.
   ``You're bound to see profit-taking coming in basically as a
result of it,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy
investments at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Some observers had attributed the recent rise in July crude oil
to concerns about pipeline distribution problems that resulted in
some customers receiving foreign crude in place of West Texas
Intermediate.
   Although the delivered crude met specifications, customers used
to receiving West Texas Intermediate were concerned about supplies,
analysts said.
   ``The short-term scare is over,'' said James Steel, an analyst
with Refco Inc. ``That led to a relaxation in the market and made
the market go down.''

<HEAD>Honeywell To Cut 300 Corporate Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. will cut its corporate staff by
300, mostly through layoffs, the defense contractor and building
controls maker said Friday.
   Seventy-five of the jobs will be lost to attrition, while the
balance of the cuts will be made with layoffs and some early
retirements, said Susan Eich, a company spokeswoman.
   The company's stock jumped $1.50 a share Friday to close at
$75.12{ in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Employees will know by June 26 if they are going to be laid off,
Eich said. The same day, Honeywell will open an office designed to
find new jobs outside the company for the laid-off workers, she said.
   About 200 of the cuts will be made at the company's Minneapolis
headquarters in such departments as human resources, legal,
communications and general office services. Honeywell has about
18,000 employees in the Twin Cities and 78,000 employees worldwide.
The rest of the cuts will be scattered in field offices across the
country, she said.
   The company said it was trimming its workforce to save money.
   In 1988, Honeywell lost $435 million. In the first quarter of
1989 it had earnings of $62.9 million, or $1.36 a share.
   The layoffs announced Friday followed a cut of 1,200 employees
announced in December.

<HEAD>Eastern Agrees to Sell Philadelphia Assets to Midway Instead of USAir</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strikebound Eastern Airlines has agreed to sell
its eight Philadelphia airport gates, 16 jets and other assets to
Midway Airlines for $206.5 million, Eastern said Friday.
   The move heads off threatened antitrust action by the Justice
Department to block Eastern's earlier proposed sale of the
Philadelphia gates and two U.S.-Canadian routes to USAir Group Inc.
   Eastern announced the Midway deal at a federal bankruptcy court
hearing over its earlier agreement with Washington-based USAir. U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland gave Eastern permission to
terminate that agreement, but still must approve the sale to
Chicago-based Midway.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9,
five days after the start of a strike by Machinists that was joined
by pilots and flight attendants.
   The sale of the Philadelphia assets is part of Eastern's plan to
reorganize as a smaller carrier and sell $1.8 billion in assets.
Lifland on Wednesday had approved Eastern's agreement to sell 15
aircraft for $277.5 million to UAS-Invest Inc.
   The unions have opposed the plan, but have been unsuccessful in
finding a buyer for the entire airline.
   On Thursday, William Winpisinger, president of the International
Association of Machinists, said he saw a ``seven-in-10 chance'' that
the bankruptcy court would approve Eastern's downsizing plan.
   Referring to Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas
Air Corp., Winpisinger said, ``It's distinctly possible he can win
and survive.'' Winpisinger made his remarks to the Indiana State
AFL-CIO annual convention in French Lick, Ind.
   A buyout plan for Eastern proposed by the unions and Chicago
commodities trader Joseph Ritchie remains under discussion, but
Lifland has said the first priority should be talks over the
airline's proposed reorganization.
   Midway agreed to purchase Eastern's eight Philadelphia gates, its
routes from Philadelphia to Toronto and Montreal, two landing slots
at New York's LaGuardia Airport, two slots at Washington National
Airport, and 16 McDonnell Douglas DC-9 aircraft.
   Used DC-9 jets generally fetch around $3 million each, industry
experts say.
   Eastern attorney Bruce Zirinsky told Lifland the airline held
negotiations through Thursday night and into Friday morning with
officials of Midway, which previously had expressed interest in
Eastern's Philadelphia assets.
   The Justice Department planned to sue to block the planned $85
million sale to USAir of Eastern's airport gates in Philadelphia and
its Philadelphia-Toronto route. The sale also would have included
Eastern's Philadelphia-Montreal route but the department didn't
object to that element.
   The department contended the sale to USAir threatened to lessen
competition in airline service between Philadelphia and other
cities. USAir already has nearly a third of the flights into and out
of Philadelphia.
   The state of Pennsylvania also challenged the proposed USAir
purchase, saying the transaction could lead to higher ticket prices.
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed in what happened. But the deal is
over. That's it,'' said USAir spokesman John Bronson in Pittsburgh.
   Dan Ashby, a spokesman for the pilots union, said the unions
planned to object in court to the proposed Midway sale.
   ``We believe that Philadelphia is an integral part of the Eastern
system,'' Ashby said. He contended Lorenzo wants to sell Eastern's
assets in that city because they compete with Continental Airlines'
hub in nearby Newark, N.J. Continental, a non-union carrier, is a
Texas Air subsidiary.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Expected To Rally After Surprising USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Live cattle futures prices posted modest gains Friday on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and experts predicted a surge next week
after a government report showed an unexpectedly sharp drop in May
placements of cattle on feedlots.
   On other markets, energy prices tumbled; grains and soybeans were
mixed; and precious metals retreated.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent to .30 cent higher with the contract
for delivery in June at 71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
unchanged to .18 cent lower with August at 80.97 cents a pound; live
hogs were .05 cent to .60 cent higher with June at 48.22 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .38 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher
witth July at 33.92 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures prices had been rising ahead of the Agriculture
Department's monthly cattle-on-feed report.
   Expectations were that it would show about a 15 percent decline
in the number of cattle placed on feedlots last month in the seven
largest producer states compared with the record-high placements of
May 1988.
   But the USDA indicated an even sharper drop in May placements,
reporting 25 percent fewer cattle were moved from pastures to
feedlots last month than a year ago.
   The seven-state total of 1.6 million cattle was 11 percent below
the 10-year average and represented the lightest May placements
since 1981. The placements brought the total number of cattle on
feed in the seven states to 7.5 million, 3 percent below a year ago.
   There are two major reasons for the lower placements. Last year's
drought dried up pasturelands and forced calf-and-cattle producers
to sell more of their animals to feedlots earlier in the year than
normal, which led to record-high placements in May 1988.
   This year's spring rains had the opposite effect.
   ``The rain improved your pasture conditions and just slowed down
that movement of cattle off of pastures into the feedlots,'' said
Dale Durchholz of Agri-Visor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   The low placements will result in tighter supplies of
slaughter-ready cattle in late summer and early fall, and will
likely push cattle and beef prices higher.
   Analysts said the contracts for August and October cattle
deliveries should see the greatest gains on Monday, with prices
expected to open .50 cent to 1 cent higher.
   Petroleum futures prices plummeted on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on signs of easing supplies of crude oil for prompt
delivery and reports that the OPEC cartel may raise its production
ceiling by 1 million barrels per day in September.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 62 cents
lower with July at $19.95 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to .63
lower with July at 45.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.34
cents lower to .10 cent higher with July at 58.14 cents a gallon.
   Most corn and soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago
Board of Trade, boosted by forecasts for a warmup in the Midwest
next week. Wheat futures closed mixed.
   Corn futures also were supported by expectations the Agriculture
Department will extend certain corn loans to farmers, which would
keep in storage some corn that would otherwise move onto the market.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 3\ cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.94\ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 3{
cents higher with July at $2.62} a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2
cents lower with July at $1.64{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower
to 7{ cents higher with July at $7.33 a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures prices fell modesty after rising for four
straight days on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled $1.90 to $2 lower with August at $368.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 2.5 cents lower with July at $5.305 a
troy ounce.

   The stock market moved ahead Friday in the
heaviest trading volume in about five months as buyers braved the
``triple witching hour.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.38 to 2,486.38,
but lost 27.04 points from a week earlier.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 811 up, 626 down and
544 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 244.51 million
shares, up from 179.48 million in the previous session.
   The unusually heavy volume on Wall Street reflected trades
associated with the expiration of stock-index futures, index options
and options on individual stocks. The set of expirations occur once
each quarter in something commonly called the ``triple witching
hour.''
   Most of the trading was concentrated around the opening and
closing of the session.
   Traders paid little attention to two government economic reports.
   ``I don't think the market moved on economic news today,'' said
Newton D. Zinder, analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., adding
that traders were preoccupied with ``triple witching hour''
strategies.
   The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6
percent in May, driven up by strong increases in food and gasoline
costs.
   Last month's rise, close to analysts' estimates, followed a 0.7
percent April increase and was taken as a sign that inflation
continues to be a problem for the American economy.
   In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing
construction continued to decline in May and starts on new homes
fell 2.1 percent from the previous month to the lowest level since
the last recession in 1982.
   Warner Communications dominated the list of actively traded
NYSE-listed stocks on news that Time intends to launch a $70-a-share
tender offer for Warner instead of merging with Warner in a stock
swap.
   More than 8.2 million Warner shares changed hands in
NYSE-composite trading and the stock wound up with a gain of 3| at
59\.
   Time, which also said it has rejected a $175-a-share takeover bid
from Paramount Communications, tumbled 9 to 162{. Paramount pulled
back by 1] to 58[.
   Another media stock, MCA, gained 1\ to 60 in response to a
Business Week magazine report that the company may be a takeover

   Court approval Friday of A.H. Robins Co.'s
reorganization should end more than a decade of waiting for
thousands of women seeking compensation for injuries from the Dalkon
Shield birth control device.
   ``There is some justice in the world,'' said Karen Hightower,
director of the Dalkon Shield Victims' Association in Atlanta and a
claimant. ``This is absolutely wonderful.''
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed A.H. Robins
bankruptcy reorganization plan with $2.5 billion set aside for women
claiming injuries from the intrauterine device sold widely in the
early 1970s.
   The money cannot be distributed until appeals to the plan are
exhausted. About 200,000 claims against the Richmond-based
pharmaceutical manufacturer are outstanding.
   An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is possible, but analysts and
attorneys said the high court is unlikely to hear the case because
the appellate court gave an across-the-board ratification.
   Constance Miller of the International Dalkon Shield Victims
Education in Seattle, who opposed the plan, said she believes the
reorganization does not provide adequate compensation.
   ``I feel very disappointed,'' Ms. Miller said. ``We're not being
treated fairly in this whole business.''
   She said the ruling means women who have not yet filed claims or
gotten medical records together need to do so before time runs out.
   Sandy Reina, a claimant who leads a victims' association in Baton
Rouge, La., said the decision is important for women awaiting
payments before they can undergo reproductive surgery or attempt in
vitro fertilization.
   ``A lot of the women here are about to fall apart from wondering
what was going to happen,'' Ms. Reina said. ``I think most of us are
ready to go forward and get this thing over with.''
   Ms. Reina said she had a total hysterectomy after years of pain
from wearing the Dalkon Shield.
   ``For me personally, it's time to let the manufacturers wake up
and tell them `Don't put any more things out there and use us as
guinea pigs,''' she said.
   Robins distributed about 4.5 million Dalkon Shields in the United
States and abroad before taking the device off the market in 1974.
Robins paid about $520 million to settle 9,400 of some 15,000 Dalkon
Shield lawsuits before seeking bankruptcy protection in 1985.
   Ms. Hightower said she has received calls ``daily and nightly''
from claimants worried because the appeals decision had taken since
December to be handed down.
   ``So many of them believed they had been used by A.H. Robins and
were beginning to doubt the court system,'' she said. ``Now they can
see there's a light at the end of the tunnel.''
   Ms. Hightower, who became pregnant in 1972 while using the Dalkon
Shield and gave birth to a brain-damaged child, said approval of the
plan will help ease some of her anger toward A.H. Robins.
   ``Once these women get a check in their hands, it won't
compensate for their injuries or the children they don't have, but
it's proof that they did something about it,'' she said.

   Four groups said Friday they remain in the
running to buy Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc., a major takeover
firm also was rumored to be a front-runner and one former suitor
dropped out.
   Pan Am Corp., oil billionaire Marvin Davis, Northwest's
machinists' union and a group led by Los Angeles investor Alfred
Checchi said they met Friday's deadline for revised bids for the
owner of Northwest Airlines, the nation's fourth-largest carrier.
   Two of those bidders, who asked not to be identified, said they
believed the New York takeover firm Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Roberts Co.
also submitted an offer. Kohlberg Kravis would not comment.
   Analysts have said the winning Northwest bid could be as high as
$120 a share, or $3.5 billion.
   NWA stock closed up 12{ cents at $107.62{ Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   MEI Diversified Inc. of Minneapolis, led by Minnesota Twins owner
and banker Carl Pohlad and including financier Irwin Jacobs, said it
would not revise its initial offer. MEI President Donald Benson did
not return telephone calls seeking comment on why MEI was dropping
out.
   A four-member committee of the NWA board announced June 5 it had
rejected all first-round bids. It asked for ``enhanced'' revisions,
saying it would favor a high price, low level of debt and an ability
to complete a deal quickly in lieu of takeover scrutiny by federal
regulators.
   NWA has declined to identify the bidders or say when a decision
would be made.
   NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier has said the board may decide not
to sell the company, possibly opting instead for a special dividend
payment to shareholders, acquisition of another company, liquidation
of the airline or sale of more than 20 percent of NWA stock to a
friendly third party.
   ``I don't think the bidding will go a third round and I think
you'll get a decision next week,'' said Mike Hamilton, an analyst
with Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood of Minneapolis.
   KKR, which specializes in buying companies with borrowed money in
deals known as leveraged buyouts, completed the largest deal in
history with the $24.53 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier
this year.
   Checchi, a former Marriott Corp. executive, has been described by
Rothmeier as a friendly suitor. His group includes Gary Wilson, a
former NWA board member, and Frederic Malek, an unsuccessful
candidate for the president's job at United Airlines who once headed
Marriott's hotel group.
   KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is an equity partner in the Checchi
group, which also has backing from Elder IXL Ltd., an Australian
investment holding company.
   A source in the Checchi group confirmed it met Friday's bidding
deadline but declined to elaborate.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said his company's revised bid
includes $200 million in equity from Corporate Partners, an
investment fund organized by Lazard Freres &amp; Co. and managed by
Lester Pollack and Ali E. Wambold.
   That brings the total amount of equity in the Pan Am proposal to
$600 million, Plaskett said.
   No other details of the offer were disclosed but spokeswoman
Pamela Hanlon said the bid still includes bank financing and
subordinated debt placed with private institutions. The earlier Pan
Am bid included $2.7 billion in bank financing.
   Analysts said Pan Am has an uphill battle for Northwest because a
merger probably would result in more debt than any other proposed
deal.
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest carrier, is more than $900
million in debt and Plaskett has said the company needs to acquire
another airline or be acquired.
   A spokesman for Davis, who opened the bidding for Northwest on
March 28 with a $90-a-share or $2.7 billion offer, said Davis has
submitted a ``new and very full'' offer.
   No details were disclosed, but the spokesman said it was Davis'
final bid.
   Guy Cook, president of the International Association of
Machinists District Lodge 143, would not disclose details of the
union's revised bid. The machinists account for about 20,000 of
Northwest's 35,000 employees.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nation, the 125-year-old weekly magazine,
jumped into the takeover fray for Time Inc. on Friday _ but its
buyout proposal offered more in the way of wry commentary than cash
or stocks.
   ``Ever since the Reagan Administration abandoned its enforcement
of the antitrust laws and the Congressional Democrats abandoned
their plan to put a cap on conglomerate size, we've been looking for
a way to do our part to protect the free enterprise system,'' wrote
Editor Victor Navasky.
   ``Now we have found it.''
   Navasky said he made his overture in a letter to Time Chairman J.
Richard Munro that is being reprinted in the July 3 issue of The
Nation, due to appear on newstands next week.
   ``A white knight is coming to your rescue,'' Navasky wrote Munro,
who heads the Time board that on Friday rejected a $10.7 billion
buyout offer from Paramount Communications Inc.
   Mimicking the lingo of investment bankers _ and casting a
broadside at the debt-financed buyout trend of the 1980s _ Navasky
wrote that his company was highly confident it could do better than
Paramount's $175 a share bid.
   ``Like other potential suitors, our plan is to pledge the assets
of Time Inc. as collateral on the loan we take to buy you out, so
cash will be no problem,'' he wrote.
   In support of the bid, Navasky noted that The Nation, which has
been published continuously since 1865 and lost money for all but
three of those years. ``Our tax-loss carryforward is staggering,''
he said.
   He also pointed out that delays in completing the deal should be
no problem for the weekly, because ``nothing we do takes more than a
week.''
   Once the deal was complete, Navasky said, The Nation would give
Time's Book-of-the-Month Club, Home Box Office cable service, People
and Time magazines and all the company's other properties their
independence.
   ``... as a magazine founded by abolitionists, we believe in
freeing the corporate slaves,'' he wrote.
   He said that idea should appeal to shareholders, who would retain
proportionate shares in all of the enterprises, and the editors and
publishers of Time's various enterprises, who wouldn't have
Paramount or The Nation looking over their shoulders.
   ``...we are even prepared to consider having the various sections
of Time (``Nation,'' ``World,'' ``Milestones,'' etc.) spun off as
independent entities,'' Navasky wrote.
   ``But all of that is subject to negotiation.''

   Supermarkets in four states plan to hand out
coupons in exchange for purchases, which will be tracked by special
cards distributed to customers, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The program in supermarkets in Colorado, Illinois, Florida and
New York is aimed at encouraging customer loyalty and finding out
what people buy, said Montine Clapper of Safeway Stores.
   The cards will electronically record the items bought and their
value, Clapper said.
   In Colorado, participating customers can earn up to seven coupons
a month at the rate of one coupon for every $50 spent in Safeway
stores, she said.
   Each month, participants will get a list of about 100 name-brand
products that qualify for discounts and a statement detailing their
purchases and how much credit they've earned.
   At the end of three months, customers will receive a voucher that
can be applied toward purchases at the store.
   The program will work similarly at Pathmark, Vons, Publix and
Giant Food stores in the other states, Clapper said.
   ``It's free and convenient ... no register tapes to count,'' she
said. ``We're getting information on our customers as to shopping
habits, trends, what they're interested in ... so we can better turn
around and see what they're interested in seeing in our Safeway
stores.''
   Safeway's program began with a test in Greeley about 1{ years
ago, then expanded into Colorado Springs, Fort Collins and Denver
area stores, Clapper said. By the end of the summer, more than
three-fourths of the 93 Safeway stores in the state will offer the
program.
   The program is run by Citicorp POS Information Services Inc. of
Stamford, Conn., which provided the computer hardware and software,
Clapper said. POS stands for point of sale.

<TEXT>
   The House passed a $157 billion savings and
loan bailout Thursday night, supporting President Bush's demand for
tough industry reforms but rejecting his plan to prevent the costs
from swelling the federal deficit.
   On a 320-97 vote the House approved the biggest financial rescue
in history from a crisis caused largely by risky and often
fraudulent lending of federally insured deposits, primarily in
Texas, California and Florida.
   Fifty-one Democrats and 46 Republicans voted against the bill.
Voting for the bill were 196 Democrats and 124 Republicans.
   ``The American taxpayers won a major victory today when the House
voted for strong, tangible capital requirements ...,'' said Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady. ``They have taken a very positive step
toward ensuring the resolution of the savings and loan crisis.''
   At the White House, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said in a conference call to news organizations, ``We are pleased by
this bipartisan step toward final passage ... We applaud the House
leadership for moving this bill rapidly through the House.''
   The vote on final passage occurred after Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa,
the leading Republican crusader against S&amp;L abuses in the House, won
an amendment to eliminate several special-interest provisions
benefitting specific companies.
   Among the provisions eliminated were those aimed at helping
Sears; Chemical Bank of New York; First Interstate Bank of Los
Angeles; Citicorp; Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and other brokerage
houses; Citizens Federal Savings Bank of Miami and Great Western
Savings Bank, one of the largest S&amp;Ls in California.
   Bush had threatened earlier Thursday to veto the measure if the
House adopted an industry-sought amendment by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., to give 241 thrift institutions a mechanism to escape having
to raise $6 billion in new capital as a hedge against future loan
losses.
   The amendment was defeated by a 326-94 vote after Bush issued his
veto threat and Democrats repeated assertions that it would gut the
reforms needed to prevent an recurrence of the crisis.
   ``This amendment would have allowed weak institutions to delay
and delay and delay the day of reckoning,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y. ``And while they delay and delay and delay, the
taxpayers pay and pay and pay.''
   The bill next goes to a conference committee of lawmakers who
will iron out differences from a Senate version approved two months
ago. With S&amp;L losses mounting at a rate of nearly $40 million a day,
the administration wants the bill enacted into law before Congress
takes its August vacation.
   Before enacting the bill, the House rejected on a largely
party-line 280-146 vote Bush's plan to finance the bailout through
high-cost, 30-year off-budget bonds rather than new borrowing
directly through the Treasury.
   ``This is a vote to save the taxpayer $5 billion in interest
costs,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.
   Only Democrats Carroll Hubbard of Kentucky, Tommy Robinson of
Arkansas and Ralph Hall of Texas supported Bush's plan. Also
rejected by a similar margin was an effort to force a tax increase
or massive spending cuts to pay for the bailout.
   However, the House amended Bush's original proposal on a 208-206
vote to make the industry subsidize low-income housing by $75
million to $150 million a year and outlaw S&amp;L investments in junk
bonds.
   The House also adopted a amendment opposed by the administration
as well as the S&amp;L and banking industries to make lenders disclose
data on their lending by race and locality in an effort to wipe out
so-called ``redlining'' discrimination.
   Basically the bill calls for spending a total of $285 billion _
including interest over the next 30 years _ to close or merge
between 450 and 600 of the nation's 2,938 S&amp;Ls whose estimated
losses total about $100 billion.
   Of the total spending, about $157 billion would come from
taxpayers and the balance from the industry, according to the
General Accounting Office.
   Only 56 of the House's 175 Republicans ended up supporting Hyde's
measure after GOP Leader Bob Michel reluctantly switched sides in
response to a strong letter from Bush appealing for support.
Democrats voted 212-38 to reject the amendment.
   Hyde's measure would have required federal regulators to grant
hearings to marginally healthy S&amp;Ls before phasing out exemptions to
capital requirements granted by regulators in the early 1980s for
``supervisory good will.''
   In a letter to Michel just before the vote, Bush said approval of
the Hyde amendment ``would render this bill unacceptable to me.''
The president said that ``giving recognition to good will as capital
... is not justifiable.''
   ``There should be no mistake,'' Bush wrote. ``This matter goes to
the very heart of my determination to clean up the abuses of the
past among the savings and loans, about which every voter is
entitled to be outraged.''
   In April, the Senate defeated by a 50-48 vote an effort by
Democrats to make the bailout part of the deficit. And Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, has collected signatures from 40 colleagues over the
last week pledging to support Bush's financing plan.
   Hyde said his ``good will'' amendment was intended only to grant
the constitutional right of a hearing to the 8 percent of the
industry that took over failing thrifts in the early 1980s and saved
taxpayers $13 billion then.
   ``The S&amp;Ls who find themselves victimized by this legislation are
not the bad guys, the high flyers,'' he said. ``The only sin they're
guilty of is trusting the federal regulators. They deserve a hearing
before the sword falls, before the scarlet letter is placed on their
forehead.''
   Critics, however, said Hyde's amendment would have gutted the
chief reform elements of the bailout _ assuring that every S&amp;L owner
puts up some of it own money as a buffer between risky loans that
may go bad and the federal deposit insurance fund.
   The fund is now running an estimated deficit of $55 billion that
is growing by at about $40 million a day because the government
lacks the money to close some 450 insolvent S&amp;Ls and pay off their
depositors.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices edged lower Friday following the
government's report that consumer prices rose sharply in May.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped 3-16 point,
or $1.87 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction from price, was unchanged from late Thursday
at 8.30 percent.
   Analysts said bond prices were weakened by the Labor Department
report that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in May,
sending inflation to an annual rate of 6.7 percent for the first
five months of the year.
   High inflation is a bad sign for credit markets because it erodes
the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds.
   ``The CPI number scared a few people,'' said John Sebastian,
executive vice president of Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   The market had rallied in recent weeks on the dollar's rapid
advance and signs that the economy was moderating. But bond prices
declined sharply Thursday when the dollar tumbled in foreign
exchange. The inflation report made traders more apprehensive.
   ``We've seen the slowdown in the economy. Unfortunately we
haven't seen the slowdown in the inflation numbers,'' said Steven A.
Wood, an economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets Group in San
Francisco.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues slipped 1-16 point to 5-32 point,
intermediate maturities also declined 1-16 point to 5-32 point, and
20-year issues fell 5-32 point, according to figures provided by
Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.16 at 1,169.25.
   In corporate trading, industrials also declined. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, slipped 1.69 to 322.50.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 7-32 point. The average yield to
maturity was 7.30 percent, down from 7.33 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.40 percent as the
discount increased 5 basis points to 8.13 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 8.38 percent as the discount jumped 7 basis
points to 7.95 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.54
percent as the discount soared 7 basis points to 7.94 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for
short-term loans, was quoted late Friday at 97-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   State gaming regulators Friday approved
Donald Trump's $63 million offer for the Elsinore's Atlantis Casino
Hotel, ending a struggle over New Jersey's first failed casino.
   The commission said it was not convinced Trump was gaining too
much power in Atlantic City and voted to approve the billionaire
developer's purchase of the closed casino, which Trump plans to turn
into a luxury hotel.
   ``I am satisfied ... that the proposed acquisition of Atlantis
would not unacceptably affect the competitive climate that exists in
Atlantic City,'' commission chairman Walter Read said before the 5-0
vote.
   The commission rejected recommendations by the Division of Gaming
Enforcement to impose several major conditions on the deal,
including a ban on future Trump acquisitions of casino-zoned real
estate.
   Trump representatives told the commission the conditions would
end the deal. Trump already owns two Atlantic City casinos and has a
third under construction.
   Over objections from two commissioners, the panel did require
Trump to gain commission approval before building more hotels or
buying more land zoned for casinos.
   The Atlantis acquisition leaves Trump with control of 34 percent
of the city's casino hotel rooms, 31 percent of casino floor space
and revenue, and 48 percent of casino meeting and exhibition space,
according to the commission.
   Commissioners Frank Dodd and David Waters said the restrictions
amounted to meddling into Trump's affairs, which they said could
inhibit further investment in the resort city.
   ``We want Atlantic City to develop but we're stifling the
potential,'' Dodd said.
   Trump did not attend the meeting. His brother Robert, executive
vice president of The Trump Organization, said he was ``delighted''
by the vote and did not object to the conditions.
   Trump plans to keep the hotel open and more than 600 employees
working while refurbishing begins. Elsinore had warned its
increasingly bleak finances threatened to close the hotel in coming
days.
   The commission this spring denied Atlantis' owners a new license,
citing Elsinore's chronic and worsening debt. It was the first time
a New Jersey casino lost a bid for relicensing since casino gambling
was established more than a decade ago.
   Elsinore and Trump struck a deal in April shortly before the
license expired and a state-appointed conservator was to take title.
Trump then announced plans to end gambling at the boardwalk property
and remake it into a luxury hotel.
   Conservator Joseph Nolan and a lawyer for the gaming division had
said they suspected Elsinore ignored offers from others who would
revive the gaming hall to the benefit of casino competition.
   Approval of the Trump sale came at the end of a three-day hearing.
   John L. White, the conservator's lawyer, argued the Trump deal
would harm competition in Atlantic City and give the New York
developer a dangerous level of control over the state's gaming
industry.
   ``The minute this organization does something to increase or
decrease prices, the competition is going to have to fall into line
or face going out of business,'' White said.
   Trump representatives denied the accusation, saying Trump's
holdings are not large enough to give him unusual influence in New
Jersey gaming.

   Wimpy owner United Biscuits PLC said Wednesday it is negotiating
with several companies to sell its restaurant division, which also
includes 284 Pizzaland and Perfect Pizza restaurants. Thursday's
Financial Times of London listed Grand Met as one of several British
restaurant companies that might have an interest in buying the
business. Grand Met declined to comment.
   Wimpy has 386 outlets in Britain, compared with McDonald's 305.
   Stephen Carnes of Dain Bosworth Inc., an analyst in Minneapolis,
said Grand Met could possibly convert some of the restaurants into
Burger Kings. The restaurant locations are valuable because Britain
is a tight market, Carnes said.
   ``Over there it's really full up,'' Carnes told the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis. ``They grow vertically.''
   The Star Tribune said the two other companies most often
mentioned in the British press as potential buyers are Whitbread and
Co. PLC, a major brewer, and Allied Restaurants.
   Grand Met acquired Burger King in January when it bought
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co. for $5.7 billion. The Burger King
subsidiary is based in Miami.

<HEAD>Cracks Found on 737-400 Engines, British Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cracks have been found on the engines of new
Boeing Co. 737-400 jets operating in Britain, the British Civil
Aviation Authority said Friday.
   CAA spokeswoman Anne Noon in London said she didn't know the size
of the cracks, their precise location or which airlines operated the
planes with engine cracks.
   But she said the cracks were not found on planes involved in
incidents last weekend in which fan blades broke and severe
vibration occurred, prompting the CAA to ground 12 737-400s in
Britain.
   The planes, built at Renton, Wash., a Seattle suburb, had been in
commercial service since October.
   The Times of London on Friday reported that the cracks in engines
of grounded 737-400s were more serious than the breaking of fan
blades in two engines, which occurred during two flights last week.
   It said the new cracks were found on previously untested engines.
   Officials at the General Electric Co.'s aircraft engine plant in
suburban Cincinnati said Friday they could not confirm the newspaper
report.
   GE spokesman David Lane said he had no other information about
the newspaper report.
   ``Our people are continuing to look very closely at this
situation,'' he said. ``To this point, it's just premature to come
to any conclusion.''
   Jack Gamble, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the
Seattle-based company could not confirm or deny the report either.
   ``We know of some cracking found in suspect engines sent to Paris
for repair, but we can't confirm it,'' he said Friday.
   The London newspaper said detailed reports on the cracks have
been sent to the French manufacturer, SNECMA, which makes the
engines in conjunction with General Electric under the joint name
CFM International.
   On Monday, the Department of Civil Aviation grounded the 12
British-operated Boeing 737-400 aircraft powered by CFM56-3C
engines. Two of those engines have been taken to the SNECMA factory
near Paris and stripped down for inspection, Noonan said.
   In the United States, Boeing Commercial Airplanes and CFM
recommended Tuesday that 737-400s with the -3C engines, and some
other engines that had been operated at high thrust levels, be
grounded for engine modifications.
   The Federal Aviation Administration followed with its own
grounding order Wednesday.
   The five U.S. planes with affected engines, all operated by
USAir, were back in service Thursday, Gamble said. USAir exchanged
the planes' engines for ones with lesser maximum thrust, he said.
   The other 28 affected 737-400s are all operated by airlines
outside the United States.
   In the British incidents, a Dan-Air 737-400 returned to London's
Gatwick Airport and a British Midlands 737-400 made an emergency
landing at East Midlands Airport after engine vibrations. Both
airlines said the turbofan blades had been damaged.
   Boeing planes have had other crack-related problems, but not with
engines. Instead, the cracks have occurred in fuselages and have
been blamed on metal fatigue and other problems of aging jets.

<HEAD>Regents Ban Channel One From New York Classrooms</HEAD>

   The New York Board of Regents on Friday
unanimously banned the Channel One news service containing
commercials from being beamed into the state's high schools.
   The regents rejected Whittle Communications' program, saying they
were worried the ``active commercialization'' of the programs would
send the wrong message to high school students.
   ``It's a very tempting package that has a flaw,'' said state
Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol in opposing the plan. ``That
flaw is that it's wrong. It's wrong legally, educationally,
financially and morally.''
   Some regents also expressed anger with Whittle's aggressive
lobbying in support of Channel One.
   The decision is a blow to the Tennessee-based Whittle, which has
said it wants to sign up 40 percent of the nation's 20,000 high
schools.
   Earlier this month, California officials threatened their schools
with a loss of funding if they signed contracts with Whittle. That
means Whittle has been rejected in the nation's two largest states.
   Laura Eshbaugh, a Whittle executive, said she was disappointed
with the decision by the New York board, but said Channel One would
be able to survive the rejection.
   ``We certainly would regret if this action means the students of
New York state would not have the opportunity to participate in the
program we are offering,'' Eshbaugh said.
   Whittle had taken its case to the public in the days leading to
Friday morning's board meeting. The company ran two full-page
advertisements in The New York Times and Meyer said some Regents
were bombarded by ``junk fax'' messages in support of Whittle.
   In return for an agreement to show the daily programs, Whittle
had offered to wire high schools with complete closed circuit
television systems, including satellite dishes, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   The most controversial aspect of its daily 12-minute news program
was trhat it contained two minutes of commercials for candy, jeans,
acne cream and other products aimed at teen-agers.
   Sobol said he's not sure it's good for society that while many
parochial school students pause for a moment of prayer in the
morning, public high school students were being asked by Whittle to
stop for two minutes of commercials.
   ``What it says to children is we don't care much about you,''
Sobol said, ``but we care what we can get out of you.''
   Several regents said they worried the commercials could cause
poor students who couldn't afford items advertised to feel
inadequate. They also said the program seems geared to suburban,
white students instead of the more troubled city schools that are in
dire need of the technology Whittle could provide.
   But Eshbaugh noted that schools contain many other forms of
advertising, such as wall posters, advertisements in yearbooks and
magazines and brand names emblazoned on the clothing students wear.
   ``Commercialization is there,'' she said. ``However any of us
might not like it there, it's there to stay.''
   The regents said the discussion with Whittle has caused them to
examine the extent of other advertising in school. The Education
Department will also look into other ways of getting more technology
and television programs into school, Sobol said.
   Some education officials also criticized the quality of Whittle's
news program. Sobol said if the state government tried to produce a
daily news program for distribution~~~almer 1b3011 Mtngly dh2

<HEAD>Senior Hong Kong Chinese Official Offers Reassurance on Colony's
Future</HEAD>

   Hong Kong's trade minister expressed confidence
Friday that China will honor its vow to protect the freewheeling
British colony's capitalist system after the 1997 takeover, despite
new anxiety raised by the bloody political repression in Beijing.
   ``The situation in China must have raised doubts as to whether
the Sino-British agreement on the future of Hong Kong will be fully
and faithfully implemented,'' John Chan, secretary for trade and
industry, told the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and
the Hong Kong Association in a speech.
   ``It is important not to lose heart, not to be defeatist,'' he
said. ``If anything, the tragic events in China have served to
accentuate the importance of the Joint Declaration to Hong Kong, not
detract from it.''
   Hong Kong will become part of China in 1997 under a
Chinese-British declaration signed in 1984. China has pledged to
maintain Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after the takeover
under what Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping has called the principle of
``one country, two systems.''
   Speaking to reporters before the speech, Chan said he was
confident China would abide by the agreement because it has an
excellent record for honoring international commitments.
   ``What gives the agreement its teeth is that it's a binding
agreement,'' he said.
   Chan, senior Hong Kong-Chinese member of the British colonial
government, was in the United States for an official visit scheduled
prior to China's June 3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing.
   The crackdown jolted Hong Kong's stability, led to a surge in
emigration requests and raised new questions about the colony's
future under Chinese rule. It has been the major topic in Chan's
talks with U.S. officials and business executives during his visit.
