   A Civil Air Patrol plane
crashed into the Gulf of Mexico during a training flight Sunday
afternoon, killing the pilot and three teen-age cadets, authorities
said.
   The single-engine Cessna 182 was reported down shortly before
2:00 p.m. three miles off the southernmost point of St. Petersburg
Beach, which is across Boca Ciega Bay from St. Petersburg.
   ``We sent a cutter and a helicopter out to the scene and all
they found was debris on the surface of the water,'' said Lt. David
Vaughn of the Coast Guard's St. Petersburg station. ``Divers later
found the wreckage in about 25 feet of water with the bodies of
four people inside.''
   The plane had taken off from a small St. Petersburg airport. The
cause of the crash was not known.
   A second small plane crash Sunday near Mound City, Kan., killed
a St. Joseph, Mo., couple and their 16-year-old granddaughter,
authorities said.
   The single-engine Mooney crashed into a field 5{ miles north of
Mound City at about 1 p.m., said Jim Grayson, a dispatcher for the
Kansas Highway Patrol.
   The victims were identified as James W. Worley, 66, who was the
pilot; his wife, Josephine G. Worley, 57, and their granddaughter,
Angela J. Procella, 16, of Kirbyville, Texas.
   In the Florida crash, a 46-year-old pilot was at the controls,
and three cadets aged 14 to 18 came along on the training flight,
said Cmdr. Frank Sportell of the Civil Air Patrol's Pinellas County
squadron.
   ``This was what is known as a Civil Air Patrol cadet
orientation,'' Sportell. ``These young people weren't familiar with
flying and this was just to give them a chance to get up in the air
with a senior pilot. They were not flying the plane.''
   The civilian organization, which helps search for downed
aircraft, often enlists young people interested in aviation careers.
   The dead were identified as pilot Wayne McNight, Shawn Kelley,
18, Joseph Flythe, 17, and Damion Weber, 14, all of the St.
Petersburg area, the Coast Guard said.

   Some 35,000 Midwestern telephone workers walked out Sunday,
joining 150,000 Baby Bell employees on strike in the East and West.
   But two of the seven regional telephone companies reached a
settlement with their workers Sunday, averting a walkout by 83,000
employees.
   Members of the Communications Workers of America struck
Ameritech, which serves 12.3 million customers in Illinois,
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin, after a midnight CDT
deadline passed.
   The strikers at Ameritech joined fellow CWA members and
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers members at three
other ``Baby Bells'' _ NYNEX, Bell Atlantic, and Pacific Telesis _
who walked out a week earlier.
   But the CWA and U S West, based in the Denver area, extended
talks after a midnight MDT strike deadline and reached a settlement
nine hours later, keeping 42,000 workers on the job.
   In St. Louis, negotiators with Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
and its union reached a tentative agreement at about 7:15 p.m.
Sunday, averting a strike by some 41,000 telephone workers in five
states.
   ``We're pleased with it,'' said Gaye Williams Mack, a
spokeswoman for District 6 of the Communications Workers of
America. ``We're very pleased that we were able to avert a strike,
especially.''
   Union spokesman Jennings Wooldridge said the company had agreed
to a 5.25 percent increase in base wages for the first year, plus a
$1,000 bonus, and a 2.25 percent increase in the second and third
years, as well as an increase in cost-of-living allowances.
   The company also dropped its attempt to make employees pay a
portion of health insurance premiums for dependents, Wooldridge
said, but there were some increases in certain health care costs.
   Southwestern Bell spokesman David Martin confirmed that the two
sides had reached an agreement, but released no details. The
company has 11 million customers in Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Arkansas and Texas.
   The strike had been put on hold as negotiators continued talking
past the midnight Saturday deadline. The bargainers broke off the
talks at 6 a.m. and resumed Sunday evening.
   The regional companies already on strike have said that most
direct-dial calls were going through normally on automated
equipment. Some union jobs were filled by management employees, but
the walkouts disrupted installations and repairs, operator-assisted
calls and inquiries to directory assistance.
   The chief issues in most of the talks have been wages and
efforts by several companies to get workers to pay part of their
health insurance costs.
   At U S West, spokeswoman Debbie Thomas said bargainers would
continue working to ``resolve details and complete other
formalities.''
   Union spokesman Bill Frazee said he expected the document to be
completed in a few days and brought to a vote by members within
weeks.
   Frazee said the new pact ``retained basically the same
health-care program'' and provides a 5 percent immediate raise,
plus smaller wage increases in the second and third years, a $600
bonus and a wage increase based on productivity.
   The company would not immediately release details of the
contract.
   CWA Vice President Walter Maulis said union members at U S West
were ``proud to have negotiated an agreement that secures a fair
share of the company's outstanding profits for the workers who made
their financial success possible.''
   US West services 11.8 million customers in Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Iowa, Utah, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Washington and Oregon.
   Ameritech has 35,000 CWA workers on strike, said company
spokesman Steve Ford. Ameritech's 18,000 members of the IBEW
settled previously with the company's subsidiaries, Ford said.
   Strikes by CWA and IBEW members began a week ago at New
York-based NYNEX, which serves New York, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut;
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which serves Delaware, Maryland,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District
of Columbia; and San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, which serves
northern Nevada and all of California.
   No formal talks were scheduled in those strikes over the
weekend, but Bell Atlantic and union representatives met for about
an hour informally Sunday.
   One of the Baby Bells settled Aug. 5 with all its workers _
Atlanta-based BellSouth, which serves nine Southeastern states. The
Baby Bell companies were created in 1984 by the breakup of American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   Scattered instances of vandalism have been reported. During the
weekend, a telephone cable was cut with a hacksaw in New Hampshire,
disrupting service to about 600 customers in Auburn, New England
Telephone reported Sunday.

<HEAD>China Orders New Work Rules for Students</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf `The new...' with 1 graf to add dropped word `attempt.'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered that this year's
college graduates must work for one or two years before pursuing
graduate studies, an official report said Saturday.
   The new rules appeared to be another attempt to prevent a
recurrence of this spring's popular, pro-democracy student movement
that was crushed by troops on June 3-4.
   About 3,500 students planned to start master's and doctoral
degree programs this fall, the official China Daily newspaper said.
But a State Education Commission circular said students, especially
those in the social sciences, must first gain work experience.
   The new order does not affect students who already have work
experience, the paper said.
   The government already has cut the number of incoming college
freshmen nationwide by 30,000 to 610,000 students in an apparent
effort to curb student unrest.
   The paper quoted an unnamed education commission official as
saying the new regulation was part of the government's efforts to
reform university enrollment and job assignment systems.
   He said the new order would significantly improve the
backgrounds of people in the fields of applied and social sciences.
   The report said more than half of this year's new graduate
students worked before continuing their studies.

<HEAD>Report: Iran Tried to Buy Toxins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has tried to buy poison-producing strains
of fungus from Canada and the Netherlands, according to The New
York Times.
   The disclosure that Iran was seeking the toxins renewed concerns
that the country is trying to develop a weapon from the substances,
Western intelligence officials said in Sunday editions of the Times.
   American officials said the efforts could be part of a research
program to develop a defense against biological weapons. But, an
American official, speaking about the Bush administration's
decision to urge the Canadians and Dutch to block the sale, said:
``There are enough bad vibes that we want to stand in the way of
it. We're bending over backwards to be careful.''
   The Iranians were seeking to buy types of fungus found on wheat
and grass that produce toxins called mycotoxins which can harm
humans and animals by inhibiting the ability of cells to synthesize
proteins, the newspaper said.
   The United States in 1982 asserted that mycotoxins were used in
a weapon that sprayed ``yellow rain'' on the Hmong tribespeople in
Laos by communist forces.
   Iran began trying to buy the fungus last December when a man
identified in intelligence files only as Mr. Moallem got in touch
with Dr. H. Bruno Schiefer, director of the toxicology research
center at the University of Saskatchewan.
   Schiefer thought it unusual because the purchase of such fungus
is usually from one of many laboratories around the world and not
from one scientist to another, the paper said. So Schiefer
contacted the Canadian government and he subsequently declined to
sell them the fungus.
   Soon after that, the Iranian Research Organization for Science
and Technology tried to buy 11 types of fungus from the Fungus
Cultures in the Netherlands, the paper said.
   The Dutch rejected the offer.

<TEXT>
   The Rolling Stones launched their 1989
tour Saturday night when they pulled into a tiny New Haven nighclub
for a tuneup that thrilled 700 fans who paid $3 apiece for the
impromptu gig.
   ``Welcome to New Haven,'' Mick Jagger shouted as the band took
the stage at Toad's Place. ``This is our debut show of the 1989
tour.''
   The Stones, who have been rehearsing for the last six weeks in
the tiny northwest Connecticut town of Washington, brought the
house down with an 11-song, hour-long set.
   The tour is the Stones' first in eight years.
   The band opened the set with ``Start Me Up,'' and played several
songs from their new album, ``Steel Wheels,'' which is to be
released Aug. 29.
   The show featured the classic songs that have made the Stones
one of rock's most enduring bands including, ``Jumpin' Jack
Flash,'' ``Honky Tonk Woman,'' ``Brown Sugar,'' and ``It's Only
Rock 'n' Roll.''
   Jagger, who wore a T-shirt promoting the 1989 North American
tour underneath a blue shirt, traded licks on the guitar on several
songs with Stones guitarists Keith Richard and Ron Wood.
   The Stones have traditionally tried to opened new tours with
impromptu shows at small venues.
   Word that the Stones were going to play at Toad's leaked out
over the last several days, said Storm Norman, music director at
WEBE-FM in Westport. Fans lined up outside the club and hundreds
were turned away before the Stones took the stage at 10:45 p.m.
Saturday.
   The audience, included a number of Washington, Conn., residents
who worked for the Stones during their stay at a former girl's
boarding school in Washington.
   Jennifer Almquist, 39, who runs an art gallery in Washington,
worked for the last six weeks as Jagger's housekeeper. Almquist,
who attended her first Rolling Stones concert in Newark, N.J. in
1964, said she enjoyed her job.
   ``I just spent the last 30 days being his housekeeper and it
changed my life,'' Almquist said.
   Also in the audience was singer-songwriter Daryl Hall.

   Republican Dr. Bob Lanier will meet Democrat Pete
Geren in a runoff for a congressional replacement for Jim Wright,
the former House speaker toppled by ethics charges, Fort Worth-area
voters decided Saturday.
   Lanier, host of the nationally syndicated TV health show ``60
Second Housecall,'' garnered 21,978 ballots, or 39 percent of the
vote, to 17,751 votes, or 32 percent, for Geren, a Fort Worth
lawyer and former aide to Sen. Lloyd Bentsen.
   That made a runoff necessary, since one candidate had to garner
more than 50 percent of the vote to win.
   Democrat Jim Lane came in third with 12,308 votes, or 22
percent. The remaining five candidates _ two Democrats, two
Republicans and a Libertarian _ trailed far behind. The highest
vote-getter of the five was Republican Laraine Bethke, who had
1,313 votes, or 2.4 percent.
   Geren immediately predicted a runoff victory, pointing out that
Saturday's combined Democratic vote topped the total achieved by
Republican candidates. ``Well, the Democrats won tonight,'' Geren
said at a victory party in west Fort Worth. ``It took us four
candidates to do it, but when you total it up, we got nearly 60
percent of the vote. I call that a victory.''
   Shortly after the results came in, Wright endorsed Geren. ``He's
a good man ... I think he will be a good congressman,'' said the
former congressman, who had not endorsed anyone running in the
special election.
   Lane said he also would lend his support to Geren.
   Lanier said he wasn't surprised Wright had come out for Geren,
and said it was ``a formidable endorsement.'' But Lanier predicted
he, too, would win the runoff.
   Under state law, candidates from both parties run in a single
special election, with a runoff between the two top vote-getters if
no one gets a majority. The law requires the governor to schedule
the runoff 20 to 30 days after the votes are officially counted,
which usually occurs within a week of the election.
   In an emotionally charged referendum in Dallas, voters approved
2-to-1 a proposal to reorganize the city council to equalize voting
power between whites and minorities. The proposal received 41,456
votes to 20,823 against.
   Voters in the Dallas suburb of Coppell faced suspension of bus
service at midnight Sunday after voting to withdraw from the Dallas
Area Rapid Transit Authority. The suburbs of Carrollton, Irving,
Plano and Rowlett decided to keep the service.
   At the American Legion post where Wright and his wife, Betty,
cast ballots earlier Saturday, a steady stream of voters turned out
during an overcast, 80-degree morning.
   Turnout had been expected to play a large part in the election
because few issues divided the candidates, and many residents
remained angry that they had to vote for anyone other than the
popular Wright.
   In the congressional race, Lanier and Geren had been the
front-runners in a recent opinion poll.
   Each man had his party's endorsements, but Lane, who stressed a
pro-choice stand on abortion, had endorsements from labor groups
and Wright's son. Wright did not endorse anyone.
   Also on the ballot were Democrats George Petrovich Jr. and Bill
Turner, Republicans Bethke and Jim Hunter, and Libertarian Robert
Buckingham Jr.
   After the 1988 election, the Texas congressional delegation had
20 Democrats and nine Republicans. The Democrats had a 34-year lock
on the 12th District under Wright.
   Wright, who was revered for his talents at serving constituents
and bringing federal money and jobs to Fort Worth, resigned his
House seat June 30 after an ethics investigation turned up 69
instances of alleged rules violations.
   Democrats went into the election controlling the House by an
80-seat margin, but faced embarrassment if they lost in a district
where registered Democrats predominate.
   In special elections earlier this year, Democrats held a seat in
Alabama and won one in Indiana, and Republicans held a seat in
Wyoming.
   In Dallas, the 10-4-1 proposal called for expanding the City
Council from 11 members to 15, with 10 elected from single-member
districts, four elected from overlapping ``super districts'' and
the mayor elected citywide. Currently, eight members of council are
elected from single-member districts and three _ including the
mayor _ are elected at large.
   Proponents said the plan would give minorities a greater voice
in city government. Opponents said it would dilute minority voting
power. Others said the plan wouldn't substantially change the
ethnic makeup of council districts.
   The transit referendum on whether five Dallas suburbs would
withdraw from Dallas Area Rapid Transit bus service could affect
the long-range fate of a $2.45 billion plan to crisscross the
metropolitan area with 66 miles of light rail by 2010. The plan
also called for 18 miles of rail connecting downtown to the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and 37 miles of bus and car
pool lanes for suburban commuters.
   Opponents said the plan would cost the suburbs a lot more than
the bus service would be worth.

<TEXT>
   Telephone workers in five Midwestern states went on strike early
Sunday, but negotiations between unions and regional telephone
companies serving 19 other states continued past midnight deadlines
in an effort to avert walkouts.
   Week-old strikes continued to disrupt service in another 15
states.
   Strikes began at 12:01 a.m. local time Sunday against Michigan
Bell, Ohio Bell, Indiana Bell, Illinois Bell and Wisconsin Bell,
all subsidiaries of Ameritech, said Steve Rosenthal, a spokesman
for the Communications Workers of America in Washington.
   But Rosenthal and Mark Belkin, a CWA spokesman, said early
Sunday that progress had been made in negotiations with
Southwestern Bell and U S West. Talks continued past midnight
deadlines.
   ``We've passed the deadline,'' Belkin said just minutes past
midnight Sunday. ``Reports from the negotiating table are that
there is progress being made. There has been a call for an
extension of the contract. However, we understand large numbers of
workers are walking out of buildings and not abiding by the
extension.''
   U S West spokeswoman Debbie Thomas said, ``What we've heard is
that they've stopped the clock ... and they're going to continue
bargaining. Obviously, the assumption is that they must be close or
else they probably wouldn't continue to bargain.''
   In the Southwestern Bell negotiations, company spokesman David
Martin said the company gave the union a new proposal about 15
minutes before the strike deadline, which had 41,000 union
employees in five states poised to walk out.
   ``I think we're still hopeful we can get a contract,'' Martin
said. He said the issues still on the table dealt with wages and
health benefits.
   But negotiations with the Chicago-based Ameritech, which serves
12.3 million customers and has nearly 40,000 CWA workers, collapsed
late Saturday.
   ``We were unable to reach a fair agreement with the (Ameritech)
companies,'' Rosenthal said. ``We are prepared to continue to
negotiate, but at this point we are on strike.''
   The three so-called ``Baby Bells'' met with or exchanged
proposals and counterproposals Saturday with representatives of the
CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   The unions set a midnight deadline for walkouts, local time.
   Strikes by the two unions against three other regional telephone
companies _ Bell Atlantic, Pacific Telesis and NYNEX _ began last
weekend. A seventh Baby Bell, Atlanta-based BellSouth, was the only
one to reach a tentative settlement last weekend.
   The Baby Bell companies were created by the 1984 breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which was not directly affected by
this month's walkouts. AT&amp;T settled with the two communications
unions earlier this year. Officials at the regional companies
already on strike said last week that most direct-dial calls were
going through normally on automated equipment, but the walkouts
disrupted repair services, operator-assisted calls, and inquiries
to directory assistance. Those strikes affected 15 states and the
District of Columbia.
   Rosenthal said the key issues dividing the unions and the phone
companies were wage increases and management efforts to make
workers help pay health insurance costs.
   Various local issues are also being discussed. In some cases,
the talks involve Baby Bell subsidiaries as well as the main
regional companies.
   Companies made strike preparations, including briefing
management employees on filling union jobs. U S West said it
planned to pull its advertising from various media outlets Monday
if there is a strike, in order to reduce demand for services.
   ``Normally, we advertise to stimulate business,'' said U S West
spokeswoman Debbie Thomas. ``If we get in a strike situation, we
would not want to overload our business offices.''
   The regional companies that faced Saturday strike deadlines were:
   _ U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., serving 11.8 million
lines in 14 states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming. It has 42,000 CWA workers and 2,000
IBEW workers, according to Rosenthal.
   _ Southwestern Bell, based in St. Louis, serving 11 million
customers in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. It has
44,000 CWA, no IBEW workers.
   _ Ameritech, based in Chicago, serving 12.3 million customers in
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. It has 39,500 CWA
workers, who are continuing talks, and 18,000 IBEW workers, most of
whom have reached a separate settlement with one Ameritech
subsidiary, Illinois Bell.
   Walkouts continued at San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, which
provides service in northern Nevada and all of California;
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which serves Delaware, Maryland,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District
of Columbia; and New York-based NYNEX, which serves all or parts of
New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, and Connecticut.
   No formal talks were held Saturday in those walkouts. However,
informal talks were held in the Bell Atlantic strike, and CWA
officials told the compnay they were prepared to bargain around the
clock, Rosenthal said.
   The one Baby Bell that settled, Atlanta-based BellSouth,
provides service in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. A
contract with its 64,000 CWA workers late Aug. 5 averted a walkout.

   Lightning forced the Air Force early
Sunday to postpone the launch of a military navigation satellite
for the fourth time in a week.
   As rain fell on the launch pad and lightning crackled nearby,
the countdown on the Delta rocket continued down to the 4-minute
mark and was held there as officials hoped for a break in the
weather.
   The launch team had only a 21-minute period starting at 2:11
a.m. in which to place the Navstar satellite into a desired
11,000-mile-high orbit. When the weather did not clear in time, the
effort was called off.
   The official reason for the scrub was ``lightning within five
miles of the launch pad.''
   The launch was rescheduled for no earlier than Friday. Officials
said the long delay is necessary because of other launch activity
in the next week.
   A schedule conflict with last Tuesday's launch of space shuttle
Columbia and thunderstorms resulted in three earlier postponements.
   The $65 million Navstar satellite is to join a network of
navigation spacecraft that can tell U.S. and allied military forces
where they are anywhere in the world - on land, sea or in the air,
and in any weather.
   The satellite is the third of 21 improved Navstars that the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992. The first
two were launched in February and June.

   Two bicycle-riding Sinhalese gunmen on
Sunday assassinated the government television's chief news editor,
the third prominent broadcast official to be killed in the past 24
days, military officials said.
   Kulasiri Amaratunga, 62, was shot in the neck Sunday morning at
his home in Mount Lavinia, a seaside resort town 6 miles south of
Colombo, according to the officials, who under briefing rules
cannot be identified.
   The assassins cut the telephone lines at Armatunga's house and
escaped on their bicycles, the officials added.
   They blamed the killing on the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese extremist group accused of killing two other broadcast
personalities last month as part of its violent campaign against
the Sinhalese-dominated government. More than 4,000 people have
been killed in the past two years after the front condemned the
government for its peacemaking efforts with the Tamil minority.
   All three government broadcasters who were killed were Sinhalese.
   The Sri Lankan military officials reported 13 other killings in
other violence during a 24-hour period ending at 8 a.m. Sunday.

<HEAD>Syrians Reportedly Overtake Strategic Mountain Town; Rocket Duels
In Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>

   Syrian troops reportedly overran a
Christian-held strategic mountaintop town Sunday, tightening the
noose around the Christian heartland as savage rocket and artillery
duels raged in Beirut.
   There was no immediate casualty report from the confrontation in
the town of Souk al-Gharb, but police said at least four people
were killed and 27 wounded in the indiscriminate exchanges across
the capital Sunday.
   A police spokesman acknowledged that the count did not include
many civilians trapped under blazing buildings in Christian east
Beirut.
   ``No one can reach them because of the intensity of the
shelling,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
standing regulations.
   The new casualties brought the overall toll to 626 killed and
1,660 wounded since March 8 when the latest confrontation erupted
between army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 predominantly
Christian troops and Syria's 40,000 soldiers and their Moslem
militia allies.
   The siege started one week after Aoun blockaded illegal ports
run by Moslem militias south of Beirut in an effort to recoup $100
million in customs dues lost annually.
   A spokesman for Aoun said the mainly Christian units controlling
Souk al-Gharb foiled an attempt to capture the town and mounted a
counterattack, engaging Syrian, Palestinian and Druse forces in
fierce close-quarter combat.
   But an official of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party said the Syrian army's 41st brigade, led by Brig.
Gen. Hashem Moallak, overran Souk al-Gharb and surrounding hilltop
hamlets Sunday.
   It was the first major ground thrust reported since the current
round of fighting erupted in March.
   The Druse official, who refused to be named, said Druse
militiamen and Palestinian dissidents opposed to Palestine
Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, took part in the
tank-led attack on Souk al-Gharb, 15 miles southeast of Beirut.
   Police said they could not confirm or deny either of the
conflicting claims but reported heavy fighting in Souk al-Gharb.
   Since September of last year, Aoun has headed a Christian
government rivaled by a Moslem Cabinet that is led by Salim Hoss
and backed by Syria.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Sunday Times reported that Israel believes two
Israeli soldiers held captive by an Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem
group died shortly after being ambushed in southern Lebanon in 1986.
   In Jerusalem, the army's chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. Ephraim
Lapid, refused to confirm or deny the report but said Israel
considers its prisoners of war to be alive unless it has
documentary proof to the contrary.
   ``By proof, we do not mean through the British media or other
media, but through the Red Cross,'' he said.
   The weekly, quoting unidentified senior sources in the Israeli
government, said Sunday that intelligence officers interrogating
Sheikh Abdul Karim Obeid have concluded the soldiers died from
wounds after being ambushed near Beit Yahoun in February 1986.
   Israeli commandos captured Obeid, the reputed leader of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern Lebanon, in a daring raid
inside the Lebanese border July 28. Israeli officials have said
they were willing to exchange Obeid for three captured Israeli
soldiers including the two cited in the Times story.
   The newspaper also said the parents of the soldiers were
informed by the military that their sons were dead, but both
families told the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot that they received
no such report. The family of one of the soldiers, Yosef Fink,
refused to comment when contacted by The Associated Press.
   The newspaper said Israel had long been aware that the soldiers,
Fink and Rahamim Alsheik, were injured when they were captured Feb.
17, 1986, but believed that at least one of the soldiers survived.
   After questioning Obeid, the Israeli government believes one of
the soldiers died 15 minutes after the ambush and the other died
hours later, the weekly said. Security officials said they believed
last week that neither Hezbollah nor Iran knew that Israel had
learned its soldiers were dead, the weekly reported.
   The newspaper said the third Israeli missing in Lebanon, air
force navigator Ron Arad whose fighter jet was shot down over Sidon
in Oct. 16, 1986, is believed to be alive but is being held by
Lebanese militia with closer ties to Syria than Iran.
   The weekly, quoting security sources in Jerusalem, said Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir has told his Cabinet not to publicly
discuss the matter of the two ambushed soldiers and has tried to
keep it secret from the United States to offset U.S. pressure to
free Obeid in exchange for Western hostages in Lebanon.
   ``Israeli leaders know that agreeing to such an American request
would help mend the recent strains in Israeli-American ties; but
they fear that Obeid's release would prompt criticism at home that
Israel risked the lives of its soldiers for an operation that
solely benefited America,'' the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Rioting Follows Protestant March in Northern Ireland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police were attacked with
gasoline bombs early Sunday in rioting that followed a Protestant
parade celebrating a 300-year-old victory over the forces of a
Roman Catholic king.
   Police used batons to disperse the crowd of 200 gathered in an
area of the city where disturbances are common after the annual
Apprentice Boys' Parade.
   ``Officers were attacked by petrol bombs thrown by a riotous mob
of 200,'' said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, a
British police force.
   No injuries were reported, he said on condition of anonymity.
   Twenty years ago, the Apprentice Boys' Parade caused riots in
Roman Catholic districts of Londonderry and led to the dispatching
of British troops to Northern Ireland three days later on Aug. 14,
1969.
   Catholics plan their own march Monday to mark the anniversary,
followed by a speech by Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a prominent
figure in the republican movement in the 1960s.
   On Saturday, four hours before thousands of Protestants marched
peacefully along city streets banging drums, security forces found
a bomb in a bar near a gate to the Catholic section of Londonderry,
known as Bogside.
   The bomb went off as it was being defused by British army
experts. It shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall,
but no one was injured.
   The Irish Republican Army later claimed responsibility and said
in a statement that the bomb was timed to go off while security
forces toured the area to demonstrate the IRA could strike in spite
of tight security.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Telephone workers and regional phone companies serving 19 states
continued talks past a strike deadline Sunday, but nearly 40,000
workers in five Midwestern states walked out when negotiations
broke down there.
   Communications Workers of America members walked out at
Chicago-based Ameritech and its subsidiaries shortly after 1 a.m.
EDT (midnight CDT.)
   In Colorado, CWA and U S West representatives bargained through
the night, while in St. Louis, negotiators for the union and
Southwestern Bell broke early Sunday morning to get some rest but
planned to resume their talks later in the day. No strike was
called at those two companies.
   ``All of our people are still working, and we hope we can keep
everybody at work today while we negotiate this afternoon and get a
settlement late this afternoon or early this evening,'' said
Jennings Wooldridge, a CWA spokesman in St. Louis, referring to the
Southwestern Bell situation.
   ``We're apart on some major items that are on table,'' he said.
``There are some things we can't accept, things we need to work
out.'' Wooldridge would not specify what issues remain unresolved.
   In a telephone recording on the U S West talks, CWA local
president Mary Blue said that as of 8 a.m. EDT, ``intense
negotiations are still continuing. we are not officially on strike
at this time. everything is on hold. But it could go either way.''
   U S West spokeswoman Debbie Thomas also said the two sides are
``still talking.''
   The walkout at Ameritech brings to four the number of so-called
``Baby Bells'' affected by strikes. Ameritech and its subsidiaries
serve 12.3 million customers in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio
and Wisconsin.
   Strikes by CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers members began a week ago at New York-based NYNEX,
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, and San Francisco-based Pacific
Telesis. Together, they serve 15 states.
   No formal talks were held Saturday in those walkouts. The chief
issues in most of the talks has been wages and company efforts to
get workers to pay part of their health insurance costs.
   The walkouts have disrupted operator and repair services, but
most direct-dial calls are not affected.
   The Baby Bell companies were created in 1984 by the breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The only regional company to settle
so far is Atlanta-based BellSouth, which provides service in nine
states.
   Ameritech has 39,500 CWA workers on strike, and 18,000 IBEW
workers, most of whom have reached a separate settlement with one
Ameritech subsidiary, Illinois Bell.
   Southwestern Bell has 11 million customers in Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Texas, and has 44,000 CWA workers and no
IBEW workers.
   U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., serves 11.8 million
customers in 14 states: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming. It has 42,000 CWA workers and 2,000
IBEW workers.

<TEXT>
   Rescue workers on Sunday located
the wreckage of a plane that crashed six days ago with Rep. Mickey
Leland and 15 other people aboard. U.S. officials said no survivors
were found.
   The plane crashed in Gambela, a town in southwestern Ethiopia 30
miles from the Sudanese border and 60 miles from the refugee camp
where the aircraft was headed, said James Haley, a spokesman for
the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   The plane went down in rugged highlands near two dirt airstrips
the pilot may have been trying to reach because of bad weather near
the refugee camp.
   ``The crash site was located. U.S. helicopters put down. They
have confirmed 13 dead, and the presumption is that the other three
are also dead,'' Haley said in a telephone interivew.
   In Washington, the Pentagon issued a statement saying U.S.
helicopters discovered the crash site, ``Air Force jumpers jumped
out of a UH-60 helicopter and ... they confirmed there were no
survivors at the site.''
   However, spokesman Mel Sudin, who read the statement, also said
the jumpers accounted for only 13 people and that it appeared that
three were missing.
   Leland, a Texas Democrat who heads the House Select Committee on
Hunger, was accompanied by eight Americans. They included three
members of his staff, a friend of the congressman, three workers
for the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the wife of
one of the AID officials.
   President Bush said in Washington, ``Barbara and I were truly
saddened to hear that the discovery of Mickey Leland's aircraft
revealed that apparently there were no survivors of this tragic
accident. Mickey Leland and the other members of his traveling
party, both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause
_ trying to feed the hungry.
   ``I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for many
years. His sense of compassion and desire to help those in need has
aided millions of people from Houston to Addis Ababa.''
   The twin-engine Twin Otter vanished Aug. 7 in bad weather. The
rescue workers did not immediately speculate on the cause of the
crash.
   However, Gambela and the village of Dembidola just to the north
had been an early focus of the search because there are two rough,
dirt airstrips nearby.
   The pilot may have diverted to one of those strips because of
heavy clouds and low visibility at Leland's intended destination.
   The Ethiopian government said peasants had heard a light plane
circling one and possibly two other dirt strips 90 miles southeast
of Gambela on Monday.
   Since the plane disappeared, an aerial and ground search by U.S.
and Ethiopian personnel had been carried out daily. At one point,
weather satellites detected what appeared to be airplane distress
signals far from the intended flight path, but a search of those
areas turned up nothing.
   The seven others on board were all Ethiopian. They included a
three-member crew, an officer with the Foreign Ministry, an officer
of Ethiopia's Research and Rehabilitation Commission, another
official and an employee of AID.
   Earlier Sunday, U.S. and Ethiopian rescuers had extended their
search for Leland's Twin Otter airplane into eastern Sudan. On
Saturday, searchers had concentrated their efforts on valleys and
mountains in a 100,000-square-mile area about the size of Wyoming.
   Another Embassy spokesman, John Guerra, said four U.S. Army
Blackhawk helicopters and six other aircraft searched Sunday along
the path the plane was to take to the camp in Fugnido, 480 miles
southwest of Addis Ababa.
   Ethiopian authorities said it was cloudy in the search area and
visibility was poor Sunday. Bad weather had dogged the operation
since it began Tuesday.
   Fugnido is the site of one of four refugee camps in southwestern
Ethiopia run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Fugnido
houses more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and a civil
war in their own country.
   A C-141 Hercules aircraft with additional personnel and
equipment arrived Saturday to help in the search.
   The reinforcements, including 100 more searchers, were sent
mainly to relieve fliers of two Hercules already involved in the
effort. They had been flying from dawn to sunset since they arrived
from West Germany on Tuesday.

   Space shuttle Columbia
swooped out of orbit and landed safely in the Mojave Desert on
Sunday at the end of a secret mission in which the astronauts
released a superspy satellite to photograph military targets around
the globe.
   Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw, commander of the five-man crew,
guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a touchdown on a hard clay
runway at 6:37 a.m. PDT after a flight that covered more than 2
million miles in five days, one hour.
   ``A super team and a great machine _ welcome home, Columbia,''
Frank Culbertson, an astronaut who served as the spacecraft
communicator at Mission Control in Houston, told the crew as the
spacecraft rolled down the runway after a perfect landing.
   After securing systems aboard the spacecraft for nearly an hour,
the astronauts left the vehicle and did a walkaround inspection.
They found a few of the 30,000 heat protection tiles missing, a
normal condition.
   Then they were driven to a nearby facility for physical exams
and showers.
   An hour before landing, Shaw fired twin braking rockets to drop
the shuttle out of orbit and start it on a fiery dive through the
atmosphere and into this desert air base 80 miles north of Los
Angeles.
   Mission Control lifted its curtain of silence to report the
successful firing. ``All parties here report a good deorbit burn;
all systems aboard Columbia are clean,'' Brian Welch, the control
center commentator, reported.
   Sonic booms cracked overhead as Columbia descended through a
clear sky and made its sweeping approach to runway 17 on Rogers Dry
Lake.
   The weather here was ideal, with clear skies, unlimited
visibility and mild temperatures.
   Although as many as half a million people have flocked to the
desert air base to watch previous shuttles land, Sunday's touchdown
was closed to the public because of the classified nature of the
mission.
   Most news about the flight has been blacked out on Pentagon
orders since an overhauled Columbia lifted off from Cape Canaveral
last Tuesday on its first flight in 3{ years.
   NASA was allowed to make only periodic statements that
spacecraft and crew were fine and to disclose the landing day and
then the time.
   Sources close to the project said the main goal of the flight
was the deployment of a sophisticated, 10-ton spy satellite
designed to snap highly detailed photographs of military
installations, troop movements and other targets of interest around
the world.
   It would help the United States verify Soviet compliance with
arms treaties, just as Russian satellites do over the United States
and Europe.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice confirmed Wednesday that a
satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in
orbit, but he wouldn't discuss its purpose.
   To prepare for the trip back to Earth, Columbia commander Shaw
and pilot Richard Richards conducted a series of tests Saturday to
make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready.
   In addition, mission specialists David Leestma, James Adamson
and Mark Brown stowed several experiments. Some of those tests were
believed to be connected with the ``Star Wars'' missile defense
project, while others involved determining how people can serve as
military observers from space.
   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, last flew in January 1986, landing
10 days before the Challenger explosion that killed the crew of
seven. After the accident NASA concentrated on making safety
modifications to the two newer shuttles, Discovery and Atlantis,
before turning attention to Columbia.
   Discovery and Atlantis each has made two space trips since
flights resumed last September.
   Columbia's return restored the shuttle flight to three vehicles
at a time when the launch rate is increasing, with three more
flights planned this year and nine in 1990. Another orbiter is
being built as a replacement for Challenger and is scheduled for
its first launch in early 1992.

   Nearly 1,000 peace activists,
politicians and relatives of victims of last year's Ramstein air
disaster marched Sunday to protest exercises by low-flying NATO
warplanes.
   Hans Georg Wagner, an opposition Social Democrat from the
Saarland state legislature, said the exercises over populated
regions of West Germany amounted to acts of ``terror,'' and he
demanded an immediate end to the practice.
   It was at the U.S. Air Base at Ramstein that three Italian
aerobatic jets performing in an air show collided on Aug. 28, 1988,
falling in ball of fire into the crowd of spectators. Seventy
people were killed in the accident.
   The Ramstein disaster led to widespread protests against
low-flying exercises by national and NATO defense forces.
   Public opposition intensified after a U.S. Air Force fighter
plane crashed into a row of apartment houses in the city of
Remscheid on Dec. 8. Six West Germans and the American pilot died
in that accident.

<HEAD>HUD Secretary Got Tons of Letters Seeking Favors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elderly man decked out in his Sunday best
posed proudly in the sunlight of a liquor store parking lot, hoping
the new Cabinet secretary would see a family resemblance in that
dignified profile.
   He wrote to Samuel R. Pierce Jr., the secretary of Housing and
Urban Development, that his mother's maiden name, too, was Pierce,
and she was from Arkansas.
   Pierce wrote back that he was from Virginia, and he was sure
they weren't kin.
   That letter was one of hundreds amassed by Pierce during the
eight years he served at HUD during the Reagan administration.
   Normally, a housing secretary's government files would be packed
off to the National Archives where they would receive scant
attention from historians, who would find sexier things to write
about than the tenure of a man who managed to remain in obscurity
throughout his time in office.
   But the $2 billion scandal of influence peddling and outright
theft that pervaded the department during the Pierce years has
changed all that. For a time during the past couple of weeks, the
crowd of reporters wanting to thumb through his files was so big
the public affairs office at HUD was taking reservations.
   One theme comes through the 48 boxes of speeches, letters,
bureaucratic jargon, ``grip 'n' grin'' photographs and mind-numbing
meeting minutes: Many of Pierce's pen pals were on the make.
   The vast majority wanted a job, some money, some time. They
tugged at every string they could find, a chance meeting at a
cocktail party, a handshake at a graduation ceremony, a family
friend in Congress, a seat in Congress, a seat at the Cabinet table.
   ``Dear Sam,'' began the 1981 letter from the late CIA Director
William Casey, trying to boost the fortunes of the son of a
deceased law partner.
   ``He's had a lot of experience in HUD, is a GS-14, is a proven
Republican, has philosophical credentials, and is the kind of
fellow who ought to be brought up from the bureaucracy into policy
work,'' Casey wrote of his friend's son.
   While the letters were as different as the people who composed
them, one thing all of the writers had in common was the
probability that they would be horrified at the thought of their
letters being dug out of the files by squads of chortling reporters.
   Finding the word ``CONFIDENTIAL'' across the top of a letter
discovered in these files now has an effect entirely opposite from
the one intended. Instead of ``keep this to yourself,'' it now
means ``Xerox me.''
   One such confidential memorandum was written in 1985 by Bernice
Williams, who at the time was director of the office of small and
disadvantaged business utilization.
   Ms. Williams had gotten into a spat with Deborah Gore Dean, who
was Pierce's executive assistant and now is a central figure in the
investigations of influence peddling. Pierce himself had said that
Ms. Dean enjoyed power and was not reluctant about using it to
flatten people in her path.
   While the files do not show what started the tiff, the incident
that brought it to a memo-writing fury was when Ms. Dean sent HUD
employees to Ms. Williams' office to cart away the furniture.
   After leading off with Ms. Dean's ``lack of sophistication and
immaturity,'' Ms. Williams went on to call her a liar and say, ``I
am not intimidated by your threats.''
   ``It is my hope that attitudinal vindictiveness be put aside in
the interest of effectively carrying out the secretary's goals and
objectives,'' Ms. Williams wrote.
   A formal reply to Ms. Williams was not found in the files, but
the fact that someone had marked her errors of spelling and grammar
gives some indication of what the tone must have been.
   Some of the papers in the files are dripping with irony, such as
the note Pierce sent to all HUD employees four years ago, urging
them to report any ``knowledge of waste, fraud and mismanagement.''
   ``The law provides broad protection from any reprisal being
taken against you for making such reports, and I give you my
personal assurance that I will not tolerate any such reprisal,''
Pierce wrote.
   On the back of Pierce's memo was typed a three-paragraph letter
from John Kieren, a HUD employee from Milwaukee, who blew the
whistle on wrongdoing in the department, got fired and spent 18
months in court to get his job back.
   ``My experience to report fraud, waste and mismanagement was a
horror story that I for one do not want to experience again,''
Kieren wrote.
   Other letters, now viewed with the 20-20 vision of hindsight,
might make their authors squirm.
   Pierce received a pair of thank-you letters from Charles Dempsey
and Paul Adams, both of whom have served as the agency's top
investigators and have been instrumental in exposing fraud and
waste in Pierce's department.
   ``I've told you previously how much I appreciated your support
and backing,'' Dempsey wrote in thanking Pierce for attending his
1985 retirement party as the department's inspector general.
   In his own note, Adams, who succeeded Dempsey, wrote that Pierce
made the event ``an evening neither Chuck nor the others who were
there will soon forget.''
   Some of the paper in the files gives a glimpse of what Pierce
himself was like. It seems that rarely did anyone he know
experience an illness or a death in the family that Pierce didn't
write a thoughtful note. In one case he wrote a letter of
condolence over the passing of ``Muffin,'' apparently a family's
pet.
   He also was mindful of the perks of his office, once inquiring
as to the free use of a restored presidential yacht, and demanding
in his extensive travels that he be accorded treatment befitting a
member of the president's Cabinet.
   In 1987, that trait nearly provoked an international incident at
Dulles Airport outside Washington, when Pierce's first-class
reservations on a flight to Paris were loused up.
   Pierce demanded an aisle seat in the first-class cabin, and an
airline employee, Sami Asfahani, went aboard to find a place for
the secretary to sit.
   ``In the course of events, Mr. Asfahani politely requested
members of a Saudi Arabian prince's party to rearrange their
seating so that I could secure the type of aisle seat I had
requested,'' Pierce wrote in a letter to the chairman of the board
of Pan American Airlines.
   ``Certain members of the prince's party overreacted in my
opinion,'' Pierce wrote.

Taiwanese ship captain was intimidated into confessing to
smuggling, a pro-Beijing newspaper said Sunday.
   The Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po said the Zhuhai
Intermediate People's Court on Saturday upheld the action of
Chinese customs officials and ordered the captain to pay $5,770 in
court costs.
   On March 6, a Chinese patrol boat seized the 1,963-ton Taiwanese
ship, Kuang Ta No. 2, near Hong Kong while it carried 31 crew
members and 4,760 cartons of cigarettes. Authorities released the
ship and crew several days later after captain Tsai Cheng-Hsiung
signed a confession that he was smuggling cigarettes.
   On April 11, the captain filed suit in Zhuhai, a Chinese port
about 40 miles southwest of Hong Kong. In the suit, the Kuang Hwa
Steam Ship Co. argued that the confession was signed under
``threat, tiring interrogation and the acute desire to release the
ship and crew.''
   It demanded $4.3 million in compensation and return of the
confiscated cigarettes.
   In its decision, the court rejected the company's argument that
the confession was extorted and that ship was in international
waters, the paper said.
   The Chinese had said the ship was in Chinese waters and its crew
planned to sell cigarettes to Chinese fishermen, a violation of
Chinese customs laws.
   Both the Nationalist government in Taipei and the Communist
government in Beijing have claimed to be the sole legitimate ruler
of China since 1949, when Communist forces drove the Nationalists
from the Chinese mainland.
   Recently, the two countries have relaxed restrictions on
Taiwanese visiting China.

<HEAD>British Liberties: Among The Casualties Of Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Behind the lives destroyed in 20 years of violence
in Northern Ireland lies another casualty: the corruption of civil
liberties in Britain itself.
   In its attempts to crush the Irish Republican Army, a nation
that ranks among the world's older democracies has adopted laws
which opponents say would look more at home in a dictatorship.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher defends the practice of
detaining suspects for a week without charging them or banning
British radio and television stations from broadcasting interviews
with IRA members as part of the price for fighting terrorism.
   ``To beat off your enemy in a war you have to suspend some of
your civil liberties for a time,'' she said after last October's
imposition of the broadcast ban, which also covers members and
sympathizers of 10 other militant groups.
   ``None of us can be neutral as between the terrorist and the
law-abiding citizen,'' added Mrs. Thatcher, who survived an IRA
hotel bombing in 1984 that killed five people, including two senior
Conservative Party figures.
   Her critics, however, detect a gradual warping of democratic
freedoms since ``the troubles'' flared and Britain dispatched
troops on Aug. 14, 1969 to keep Northern Ireland's Protestants and
Catholics apart. Twenty years later, the troops remain.
   The Financial Times of London, in an editorial in December,
commented on ``a lengthening list of recent government decisions
each of which has given greater weight to reasons of state than to
the civic rights of the individual. Most, but not all, arise from
the troubles in Northern Ireland.''
   However, the most controversial legislation, the Prevention of
Terrorism Act, is a legacy of a Labor government _ enacted in 1978
after 21 civilians were killed by an IRA bomb in an English pub.
   The act, which applies throughout what is known formally as the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, includes
police powers to detain suspects for up to a week without charge.
   In the decade of rule by Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative
government, Northern Ireland's death toll climbed past 2,700 and
Britain has been cited 21 times _ the most by any country _ for
violating the European Convention on Human Rights.
   Her government imposed the broadcast ban on paramilitary groups
and limited, or proposed limiting, the right of a suspect to remain
silent.
   Since last fall, courts in Northern Ireland have been able to
interpret an accused's silence after arrest as an indication, in
some circumstances, of guilt. Those circumstances are:
   _ Failing to mention during interrogation any fact offered in
defense at trial.
   _ Refusing to be sworn or answer questions at trial.
   _ Failing to explain any possessions or marks on the defendant's
clothing or person at the time of arrest.
   _ Failing to give an account for being at a particular place at
the time of arrest.
   The courts themselves, which are convened without juries which
might be intimidated or split along sectarian lines, are also an
extraordinary step taken in 1973 to combat terrorism.
   Last month, a government advisory panel proposed limiting the
right of silence for ordinary criminals in England and Wales.
   Regulations under the anti-terrorist act have been used to
compel photographers and television stations to hand over material
to help police investigations.
   TV networks complained their crews were put in added danger
after being compelled last year to hand over unscreened footage of
an IRA funeral march in which two British soldiers were murdered by
a mob.
   ``We'd been pushed another step down a road with an uncertain
ending,'' commented Roger Bolton, an executive with London's Thames
Television station, after giving police tape of an interview with a
suspected terrorist.
   Britain's run-ins with the European Court of Human Rights are
partly due to the fact that this country has no written bill of
rights or constitution and thus issues are automatically
transferred to the court in Strasbourg, France, instead of being
filtered through domestic courts.
   Last November, Britain refused to implement a ruling by the
19-judge court that the anti-terrorism act's detention powers
violate the European Human Rights Convention and should be repealed.
   The case was brought by four Northern Ireland men who were held
for between 4{ days and a week in 1984 and then released.
   Britain invoked an article of the convention that says the
ruling need not be accepted ``in time of war or public emergency
threatening the life of the nation.''

   US West and the Communications Workers of America
announced Sunday that they had agreed on a three-year contract,
nine hours after a strike deadline at the regional phone company
had passed and been extended.
   Details of the verbal agreement were not immediately released. U
S West spokeswoman Debbie Thomas said the bargaining teams would
continue working throughout the day to ``resolve details and
complete other formalities.''
   ``We're really pleased we got the settlement,'' she said. ``We
think it's going to be beneficial to the employees and to the
company and to the union, and also to our investors.
   ``And the customers will benefit as well because CWA employees
will be able to remain on the jobs.''
   CWA Vice President Walter Maulis said the union was ``proud to
have negotiated an agreement that secures a fair share of the
company's outstanding profits for the workers who made their
financial success possible.''
   CWA represents 42,000 US West workers in Arizona, Colorado,
Idaho, Iowa, Utah, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Washington and Oregon.
   ``We here in District 7, while pleased to have reached a
tentative agreement with U S West, stand in solidarity with our CWA
brothers and sisters who are currently on strike,'' Maulis said.
   Strikes by CWA and International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers members began a week ago at New York-based NYNEX,
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, and San Francisco-based Pacific
Telesis. Together, they serve 15 states. Workers struck
Chicago-based Ameritech at midnight CDT Saturday.
   In St. Louis, talks with Southwestern Bell broke early Sunday
morning so negotiators could get some rest, but they planned to
resume their talks later in the day. The contract expired at
midnight Saturday.
   The previous US West contract also expired at midnight, but
negotiators extended the deadline in an effort to reach the
settlement.
   Thomas said the mood at company headquarters was ``tired and
relieved.''

<HEAD>Grain Farmers Get Easy Targets in Foreign Currency Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities have set relatively easy
targets for collective farms in an experiment designed to increase
grain production by paying for excess crops in convertible
currency, a newspaper said Sunday.
   The newspaper Labor said farms will be paid in dollars and other
world currencies for any high-quality grain they produce above
their average for 1981-85. The entire Soviet Union produced an
average of 180 million metric tons of grain during that period, far
less than the 210-211 million metric tons produced in the record
years of 1986 and 1987.
   Soviet authorities hope to stimulate domestic grain production
enough to reduce purchases of grain on the world market.
   Farms will be allowed to spend their hard currency as they wish
to obtain Western combines, food-processing equipment and other
items, the newspaper said. It was not clear if the farms could
choose to buy consumer goods.
   For peas and oil crops, the standard will be more difficult: the
average production of 1986-88, which were fairly good years.
   The two-year experiment will apply to collective and state
farms, the newspaper said. Authorities are still debating whether
to allow farmers on the new leasing program to join.
   American economist Marshall Goldman, commenting on the program
when it was proposed in June, said it could undercut the attempt to
convert farms to individual leaseholds.
   He predicted that collective farms seeking to break previous
records to obtain foreign currency will be unwilling to allow
individual farmers to break out on their own and lease part of the
farm's land.

<TEXT>
   A new school is being named after
David ``the bubble boy,'' the youngster unable to fight disease who
died at the age of 12 after spending most of his life in a series
of bubble-like sterile isolators.
   David's parents were joined Friday by relatives and officials of
the Conroe Independent School District during ground-breaking
ceremonies for David Elementary in this community north of Houston.
   ``He inspired all of us,'' said his mother, Carol Ann. ``I want
students to be inspired by his experiences as well.''
   David, who died 5{ years ago, lived all but the last two weeks
of his life in sealed, sterile surroundings. The news media
throughout that time and since have upheld an agreement not to
disclose his family's last name.
   School district Superintendent Richard Griffin said schools are
rarely named after students, but David deserved it because his life
typified ``the courage so important to the American character.''
   David's life will be remembered in a selection of material in a
reading room of the school's library, Griffin said. He said the
school also will have an outdoor education center because district
officials ``felt that would please David.''
   David attended elementary school through the fifth grade in The
Woodlands and developed a ``wonderful interest'' in education, his
mother said.
   He also had a keen interest in the outdoors and dreamed of
``running through the grass barefooted,'' she said.
   ``It's fitting that the school would be here, in the forest,''
she said.
   David's isolation was needed to keep out germs because he was
born with a condition known as severe combined immunodeficiency
disease. About 30 to 50 children are born with this disorder in the
United States each year, and they have little or no natural
resistance to infections.
   Doctors tried to construct his immune system by giving him
healthy bone marrow, the source of disease-fighting blood cells,
donated by his sister. The transplanted cells did not survive, but
they apparently infected him with a common virus which caused
runaway cancer of his white blood cells, and he died Feb. 22, 1984.
   It was the first conclusive evidence of cancer developing in a
human after infection by a virus, said Dr. William T. Shearer,
David's physician at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.

<TEXT>
   In another sign of improving Israeli-Soviet
relations, Israel's Agriculture Ministry and the Soviet Academy of
Sciences have signed an agreement to create a joint agricultural
company, officials said Sunday.
   The announcement, carried by Israel radio, came one day after
the Soviet news agency Tass reported the two countries had agreed
on their first joint venture, which will make medical equipment.
   Amram Olmert, director of Israel's government-run Agrideb
company, expressed hope that the new farm sector company, Agromir,
would help solve the Soviet food crisis.
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic ties with Israel to protest its
occupation of territories belonging to Moscow's Arab allies in the
1967 Middle East war. But cultural and tourism exchanges have
expanded since the two countries exchanged interest offices in 1987
and 1988.
   Olmert told Israel radio that Israel's advanced agricultural
technology contributed to the Soviet desire ``to cooperate on a
concrete, business basis, without any political implications.''
   The radio reported that the agreement was signed Saturday at the
end of a 12-day visit by a five-member delegation from the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, which surveyed Israeli agricultural techniques.
   Israel radio said Olmert will travel to Moscow in September, to
be followed by other Israeli specialists in October.
   The daily Hadashot newspaper said the Soviets will import farm
and dairy equipment from Israel, as well as 200 cows. It also said
Agromir will create a crop and poultry farm near Moscow.

<HEAD>Issue of Deposit Insurance Lingers Past Bailout Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the self-congratulatory back slapping
surrounding enactment of landmark savings and loan legislation last
week, many experts say the government failed to address one of the
root causes of the bailout _ the deposit insurance system itself.
   President Bush signed the bill, at $159 billion the largest
financial rescue in the nation's history, in a Rose Garden ceremony
attended Wednesday by smiling Cabinet secretaries and leaders of
Congress.
   ``It'll safeguard and stabilize America's financial system and
put in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happen
again,'' he said before handing out souvenir pens to legislators
who helped pass the law.
   But a growing group of conservative, and some
not-so-conservative, thinkers believe Bush can't really make that
promise until policy-makers tackle the politically explosive issue
of deposit insurance reform.
   White House economic advisers, just before President Reagan left
office, tried to raise the issue, suggesting that deposit insurance
ought to be ``curbed.'' But, even that vague recommendation raised
a firestorm of criticism in Congress.
   Rather than mire emergency S&amp;L legislation in endless debate,
the Bush administration decided to postpone the question by
ordering the Treasury Department to study the issue and report its
findings in 18 months.
   Academic analysts, however, say the debate should not have been
postponed. They argue that it is deposit insurance that not only
put each taxpayer on the hook for $1,000 over 30 years, but
encouraged S&amp;Ls to run up the losses in the first place.
   In a phenomenon economists call ``moral hazard,'' thrifts that
had lost their owners' investment had every incentive to gamble
with federally insured deposits.
   If outlandish loans to sperm banks and windmill farms paid off,
S&amp;L owners recovered earlier losses. If the investments soured, as
they usually did, the insurance fund had to pay.
   ``The perverse incentives of federal deposit insurance allowed
the drunk drivers of the S&amp;L world to operate without paying any
more for insurance than their sober brothers,'' said Bert Ely, a
financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.
   He advocates privatizing the system by allowing banks to form
syndicates to cross-guarantee one another. Banks with risky
portfolios would pay higher deposit insurance fees, instead of the
flat rate all banks pay to the government no matter how well run.
   Ely's plan is just one of many floating around. Some, like his,
would do away with the federal system established in 1934 as the
cure to the wave of bank failures that swept the nation in the
early years of the Depression. Others would tinker with, but not
abolish, the system in an attempt to inject more ``depositor
discipline.''
   John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the nation's largest bank,
advocates reducing the $100,000 per account insurance limit and
subjecting deposits over that to a 10 percent to 15 percent
``haircut'' in the event of failure.
   That system, similar to Great Britain's, would, in effect,
impose a deductible.
   Just as motorists who have to pay the first $200 damage from an
auto accident in theory drive more carefully than fully-insured car
owners, depositors who could lose some of their money will pay more
attention to where they open accounts.
   Other reform proposals, such as one offered by William M. Issac,
former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., would limit
depositors to one insured account in an attempt to get at the
practice of brokering deposits, that is splitting large sums into
$100,000 pieces and parceling them out to different institutions so
the entire amount is insured.
   All of the proposals likely will be examined by the Treasury
Department in its study. After that, in early 1991, the issue
returns to Congress.
   But few are expecting Congress to approve anything but
incremental changes at most.
   ``I suspect it will not promote anything radical,'' said L.
William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, which under last week's
legislation now insures S&amp;L deposits as well as bank accounts.
   ``We have just invented a whole new logo (for banks and S&amp;Ls)
saying the government's full faith and credit is behind those
deposits. I think any attempt to change that will be very
difficult,'' said Seidman, whose agency released its own study
early this year concluding that the benefits of deposit insurance
outweigh the drawbacks.
   Those who oppose tinkering with deposit insurance make three
arguments: that the system has worked, preventing bank runs for the
past five decades; that doing away with the system would force
banks to lend only to big organizations, drying up credit to small
businesses, and that curbing deposit insurance would help big bank
holding companies at the expense of small community institutions.
   One premise of advocates of insurance reform is that a bank run,
a contained bank run, is not something to fear more than the
failure of any other kind of business. Rather, the threat of a run
acts to encourage sound banking.
   ``The Depression so traumatized us that we don't even want to
think about a bank failure,'' said George G. Kaufman, a professor
at Loyola University in Chicago. ``An individual bank run is really
not bad at all except for the individual bank. If a bank thinks
there is a possibility of a run, they're going to behave a lot
differently than if they don't.''
   The flaw in that argument, according to Robert Litan of the
Brookings Institution, a liberal oriented think tank in Washington,
is that regulators can never be sure a bank run won't spread. Even
the healthiest banks don't have enough cash to pay off all
depositors all at once and just a hint of trouble can spark a run.
   ``In theory, there's nothing wrong with letting one bank fail,''
Litan said. ``But any policy-maker faced with that choice generally
doesn't want to go down in the history books as running an
experiment that allowed the system to go down.''
   Moreover, according to Seidman, for depositor discipline to
work, depositors must be able to easily and quickly determine their
bank's condition.
   ``I don't think we can depend upon depositors to know on a daily
basis the condition of their banks. We (at the FDIC) have great
problems doing that, even with thousands of bank supervisors,'' he
said.

   Up a grimy staircase, through a dim
hallway and into a fourth-floor apartment, the Beatles are playing
and Kolya Vasin is preaching to a new generation the Beatles gospel
he accepted a quarter-century ago.
   From long ago and far away, the Beatles have had a grip on
Soviet youth, many of whom have lost faith in government and been
denied free access to religion.
   ``In your country, rock 'n' roll is just music,'' 19-year-old
Dima Vasiliev, a budding guitarist, told an American reporter.
``Here it's our soul, our heart. If there weren't rock and roll,
I'd be a Young Pioneer or Komsomol member,'' he said, referring to
Communist Party youth groups.
   ``The Beatles and what they did had a special effect on
Russia,'' said Vasin, 43, who describes himself as the Fab Four's
biggest Soviet fan and a ``Beatleologist.''
   With his long black beard, he could be mistaken for a Russian
Orthodox priest but for the Paul McCartney T-shirt he wears.
   ``Here, in a spiritual hunger, it's indescribable. It's a
substitute for religion,'' he said.
   Memorabilia is everywhere in Vasin's single grubby room, his
part of an apartment shared with two other families.
   It is a shrine, museum, dining room, living room and bedroom all
in one. Shelves from ceiling to floor are filled with Beatles books
and buttons. Walls are lined with ``A Hard Day's Night'' and
``Yellow Submarine'' posters and portraits of John, Paul, George
and Ringo.
   Like an eternal flame, a lamp atop the bookshelf continuously
throws orange light onto a photograph of John Lennon, who was
murdered in 1980. A small sign in front reads in English, ``Bless
You.''
   Vasin's proudest possession is a red, white and blue soccer
jersey he says Lennon wore. He said he got it through a friend of
singer Joan Baez.
   About a dozen teen-agers are sitting around a table as Beatles
music blares from a tape recorder.
   ``What's the name of that song?'' Vasin demands of one.
   The boy shrugs his shoulders.
   ``I'll have to call your mother about that tomorrow,'' Vasin
says jokingly.
   Vasiliev calls Vasin his spiritual father who ``taught us that
there's more than what school and parents taught us.''
   The teen-agers come by regularly to sing, dance and talk music.
   Vasin takes his Beatlemania seriously. He's been at it for 25
years, since a friend played him a tape recorded off British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Something happened,'' he recalled. ``The words used were the
best. It was a high. Like God, sacred. A love hit me which I didn't
have before, only love for my mother.''
   Vasin, a painter, made himself an expert on Beatles trivia.
   He collected more than 15,000 Beatles photos, all of their
albums, bootlegged recordings and every scrap of paper about them
he could find.
   As ``I Saw Her Standing There,'' ``Help,'' and ``Norwegian
Wood'' resounded, he showed a reporter two Beatles
``encyclopedias'' he painstakingly compiled, including newspaper
clippings, photographs and poetry by or about the Beatles.
   Two articles serve as reminders that Beatles music and the
lifestyle they represented once were officially frowned on.
   ``These bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive
passions,'' the satirical magazine Krokodil wrote in 1964. In the
same year, the head of the Soviet Composers Union titled his
condemnation of the Beatles in Literary Gazette, ``From the Life of
Bees and Dung Bugs.''
   Beatles records were banned, but Vasin and other Soviet Beatles
fans found other sources: foreign radio broadcasts and smuggled
albums. Still, just listening wasn't enough.
   By 1966, he recalled, ``People you would meet on the street
talked not about their illnesses or studies. The subject was the
Beatles. They were also the main subject of telephone calls.''
   The group's music spawned dozens of copycat groups in the Soviet
Union and gave birth to original Soviet rock, such as the group
Aquarium, which recently signed a U.S. recording contract and whose
lead singer, Boris Grebenshchikov, credits the Beatles with
changing his life.
   Fans held Beatles festivals, swapped tapes and photos, bought
their albums for exhorbitant prices on the black market, and some
sported their familiar haircuts and dressed like them in jackets
with round collars and no lapels. Vasin says some were arrested for
``hooliganism'' and ``anti-social behavior.''
   One teen-ager at Vasin's apartment said police fined his father
for playing Beatles music too loudly.
   The first positive press report about the group appeared in
1968, and Vasin recalls in a Soviet rock history book titled ``Back
in the U.S.S.R.'' that he was so happy he ran around Leningrad with
the article in his hand shouting, ``We've won!''
   More than two decades after they rocketed to the top of Western
music charts, the Beatles began to receive official recognition
here.
   The state record company Melodia in 1986 issued ``A Taste of
Honey'' and ``A Hard Day's Night.'' Some singles had been released
earlier without mentioning the group's name, because Melodia didn't
legally obtain permission to distribute them.
   Soviet Beatlemania has not gone unnoticed by the people who made
the music.
   In November, Melodia released ``Back in the U.S.S.R.,'' a
collecton of old rock 'n' roll songs McCartney recorded exclusively
for Soviet fans. He also paid tribute to them in January in a
phone-in show on the BBC's Russian service. He said he would like
to perform in the Soviet Union and that he admired Soviet fans for
following the Beatles despite official harassment.
   ``It didn't put us off, Russians. We love you madly,'' he said.

   Add one more issue to the list of conundrums
Congress will have to unravel when it returns from its summer
recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in North America
should be renamed.
   It's a perennial duel between an Ohio congressman protecting the
honor of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. president after whom the
peak is named, and an Alaska senator defending his state's right to
name its own land features.
   The motives of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, are easy to discern.
   ``His long-range goal is to see if the mountain can be renamed
with Alaskans' wishes,'' says Connie Godwin, his spokeswoman.
   It takes only a quick look at the background of Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio, to explain why he cares about the name of the
20,320-foot mountain in central Alaska, a continent away from the
people he represents.
   ``McKinley is from my district,'' Regula says.
   McKinley, assassinated in 1901, was not only from Regula's
district, but once held Regula's seat in Congress and is buried in
the district. Regula is even a graduate of the William McKinley
School of Law.
   McKinley _ the mountain _ is in Denali National Park, which was
renamed in 1980 from McKinley National Park. Denali is an Indian
word for ``The Great One,'' and many Alaskans would like to see the
mountain bear the same name.
   ``It's owned by 230 million Americans,'' Regula said last week.
``Alaska gets millions of dollars in taxes, and taxpayers from the
entire country have a right to decide what happens there.''
   A provision forbidding the government to rename the mountain was
buried in the fine print of the annual Interior Department spending
bill that the House passed July 12. When the Senate approved its
version of the legislation two weeks later, the Mt. McKinley
language was removed.
   It's a legislative dance that has been going on for years, and
Regula has always prevailed.
   ``Ted goes along with a one-year prohibition, but not with
statutorily naming it Mt. McKinley,'' says Regula.
   Like most geographic features, Mt. McKinley was not given its
name by law. Rather, its name is officially recognized by the Board
of Geographic Names, a division of the Interior Department.
   It was named Mt. McKinley in 1896, when McKinley was Ohio
governor and the Republican presidential candidate against Democrat
William Jennings Bryan.
   In 1975, the Alaska state legislature passed a resolution
requesting that the park and the mountain be renamed to Denali.
Congressional hearings were held two years later. In a compromise,
the park was renamed in 1980 but the mountain retained its name.
   Negotiators from the two chambers probably will meet next month
to work out a compromise bill.

<HEAD>Bradley Collects More than $2 Million in 1989 for Senate Re-Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANE E. ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sen. Bill Bradley dipped into the money pools
of New York and Hollywood for more than $2 million in campaign
funds during the first seven months of the year even though there
is no GOP challenger in sight for his 1990 re-election bid.
   The effort vaulted the New Jersey Democrat into second place
among 1990 Senate incumbents for dollars raised this year _ behind
Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., and left him with more than $3.4 million.
   Actress Mary Tyler Moore, author Neil Simon, and ``Amadeus''
star Tom Hulce have written checks to the New Jersey Democrat's
re-election campaign.
   So have Warner Communications Chairman Steven Ross, MTV founder
Robert W. Pittman and Viacom International President and CEO Frank
J. Biondi Jr.
   Bradley's biggest money source from Jan. 1 to June 30 was a
$1,000-a-head New York City fund-raiser April 10 that netted $1.1
million, the most ever for a Bradley event.
   How do observers explain the nation appeal of Bradley?
   ``He's got sort of a magical nature about him that sort of
transcends politics,'' said Charlie Cook, who publishes The Cook
Political Report.
   ``His fund-raising prowess is extraordinary,'' said Tom Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
``He's one of the party's celebrities, a rising star.''
   Despite the contributions and Republican Gov. Thomas Kean's
recent assertion that Bradley is unbeatable, the campaign is taking
nothing for granted as it looks for an additional $6 million.
   ``Let's remember there is a governor's race in New Jersey,''
said Nick Donatiello, Bradley's campaign manager, in explaining the
lack of GOP candidates stepping forward so far.
   ``This is going to be an expensive Senate race,'' predicted
Donatiello. ``We would like to have $9 million to spend on the
campaign.''
   In 1984, Bradley spent $5.1 million to hold onto his seat,
compared with $956,000 spent by Republican Mary Mochary.
   Although Bradley has been mentioned for years as presidential
material, Donatiello put aside questions that Bradley might be
filling his coffers in anticipation of a 1992 White House bid.
   ``There's always the speculation,'' he said. ``We fully expect
to spend all the money we raise for the 1990 campaign on the '90
campaign.
   ``In order to run in New Jersey, you have to buy five Senate
races'' worth of media time _ for New Jersey, Connecticut,
Pennsylvania, Delaware and the most expensive media market of all,
New York, he said.
   Cook agreed.
   ``It's fairly prudent for a senator to run a decent amount of
TV. Secondly, think about what percentage of the U.S. population is
within those media markets. He's going to get a piece of the
country in terms of 1992,'' Cook said.
   Mann said Bradley has opted to be safe and at the same time
leave his political options open.
   ``Politicians always run scared, assume the worst and prepare
for it,'' said Mann. ``Therefore, you raise money if you're able to
as a way of discouraging whatever potential opposition may surface
and being ready to wage a serious campaign if you need to.''
   Looking at Bradley's ability to raise $4.3 million toward 1990,
Mann said: ``All of it fits in well with a potential run for the
presidency in 1992 or 1996 in any case. It seems very sensible even
if he hasn't decided if he's going to do that.''

<HEAD>Woolstock Not So Keen on Woodstock `Copy' Party, But Sponsor Undaunted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER MUNNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of little Woolstock, Iowa, say
they're not about to allow a concert in the town park on the
anniversary of the Woodstock rock festival because they're worried
about drugs and undesirables.
   But the radio station sponsoring the event said the show will go
on whether the city likes it or not, on private land if need be.
And besides, how many undesirables are going to show up at supper
time on a week night? Even if there are free hot dogs?
   The City Council in the north-central Iowa town of 230 people
voted 4-1 Friday to prohibit radio station KRIT in Fort Dodge,
about 20 miles from Woolstock, from holding a two-hour concert at
the park Tuesday night to observe the 20th anniversary of Woodstock.
   In 1969, a long list of leading rock groups attracted more than
500,000 people to a dairy farm in the Catskills of New York state,
actually about 45 miles from Woodstock.
   KRIT officials said they were inspired to hold the concert
because Woolstock is just a letter away from Woodstock, but despite
that similarity they said the town really doesn't have to fear it
will be overrun.
   Woolstock officials said they didn't want to take a chance.
   ``We're not an anti-social town,'' said Councilman Norval Story,
who voted with the majority. ``We like to have these gatherings.
But we were kind of concerned about the element that might come in.
The drug problem is bad enough as it is.''
   Story and Woolstock Mayor Kenneth Spellmeyer said the event
could have been sponsored at the park if KRIT had given the town a
little time to plan. Instead, they said, town officials learned of
the event in newspaper accounts last week.
   ``I think they're blowing it up a little,'' said KRIT news
director Amy Alberts.
   ``Look, it's from 6 to 8 p.m., no alcohol will be allowed and
it's in a fairly remote area on a Tuesday night, so you're not
going to have that many people,'' she said.
   Instead of Jimi Hendrix or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, the
musical talent is Scott Dohrmann of Barnum and Kevin Lind of Fort
Dodge, both guitarists.
   ``They're the most wholesome guys in the whole world,'' Ms.
Alberts said. ``Sure, there will be music from the '60s and a sound
system, but there won't even be any drums.''
   ``And there can't be all that many people. If anybody has to
work the next day, they certainly aren't going to drive too far.
It's Tuesday night, after all.'' However, there will be the
attraction of free hot dogs and soft drinks, courtesy of KRIT.
   Dorhmann does not have a telephone listing and no one answered
the telephone at Lind's residence.
   As for the failure to notify town officials in advance, Ms.
Alberts said the radio station didn't know it needed to ask for
permission. Besides, she said, the town didn't have to do anything.
   ``It's up to KRIT to do all the planning. It was our event. If a
family were planning a reunion in the Woolstock city park, it's the
family that puts it together,'' she said.
   Ms. Alberts said the radio station is determined to hold the
event regardless of whether it has the blessing of the Woolstock
council.
   ``This is going to happen no matter what,'' she said. ``Before
the council met, an area farmer called us and said he suspected
they would vote it down. He said we could use some of his land.
   ``And we got a call from a person in Woolstock who said he had a
big lot where we could hold it.''
   She said radio officials will visit the proposed sites and make
a decision on where to hold the show by Monday morning.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Schools, Colleges, Strain Under Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deep cuts in state spending will mean larger
classes, closed schools, fewer teachers and fewer sports programs
for the 1 million students returning to Massachusetts public
schools and colleges next month, educators say.
   At the state's 29 public colleges and universities, students
will feel the effects of a $39.3 million cut in higher education
funding ordered by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. The 1,800 public
schools will have to shoulder their share of a $210 million
reduction in state aid to cities and towns.
   Educators use words like ``disaster,'' ``tragedy,'' and
``devastation'' to describe the impact.
   The governor, who touted his state's booming economy during his
unsuccessful presidential campaign last last year, only to be
blindsided by a surge in red ink this year, expressed deep regret
in announcing the cuts last month. But he said he had little choice
but to carve $491 million out of the state's 1989-90 budget.
   The cuts and the withholding of funds were needed to bring the
budget to $12.2 billion, in keeping with a balanced-budget
provision in the Massachusetts Constitution.
   Schools in communities small and large are feeling the pinch.
For example:
   _ Brockton is considering a plan to charge high-school atheletes
to take part in sports programs.
   _ The small central Massachusetts community of Belchertown may
begin making students pay to ride the school buses.
   _ Springfield will have to lay off at least 300 and possibly as
many as 800 teachers out of a faculty of 2,000 because of a severe
budget crisis in that city. All but a few athletic programs have
been cut including soccer, ice hockey and swimming, according to
Assistant Superintendent Ann Southworth.
   _ Some 8,000 college students _ most of whom would attended
community colleges, designed to serve the poorest sector of the
community _ will be turned away.
   ``It is a cruel blow to schools,'' state education Commissioner
Harold Raynolds Jr. said last week. ``There won't be a single
school across the commonwealth that is intact as it was last
spring.''
   Higher education Chancellor Franklyn Jenifer said that despite a
7.7 percent tuition increase and steep hikes in student fees, the
budget crisis has halted a push to advance the state's public
college and university system into the nation's top rank.
   ``We will at best be doing worse than we were last year, and
last year was a bad year,'' Jenifer said. ``We've taken the
position that one maintains quality at all costs. Access to
mediocrity is no access at all.''
   Higher education budget cuts will translate into 1,900 canceled
course sections for the 120,000 full-time students, Jenifer's staff
has calculated. Some 1,200 part-time faculty and staff positions
are being cut, and 8,000 student slots, most in community colleges,
were eliminated for the fall term.
   No one will be turned away from public elementary and secondary
schools. But because of faculty and staff cuts, some of the 824,000
public school students will be in bigger classes than before.
   Staff and faculty reductions at public schools across the state
are expected to reach 8,000, according to the Massachusetts
Teachers Association.
   In Boston, a parents group and the Boston Teachers Union have
gone to court to block a plan to close six public schools and
consolidate three others.
   ``Two years from now, people are going to be saying, `How come
our kids can't compete?''' said Rosanne Bacon, president of the
Massachusetts Teachers Union. ``We're unwilling to spend our money
on our kids. This is not the way they do things in Japan.''

<HEAD>Navy Moving To Outflank Opponents Of Its Nuclear Blast Simulator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barred from the Chesapeake Bay by Congress and
hounded by environmentalists in North Carolina, the Navy now is
trying to outflank its opponents as it eyes the Gulf of Mexico to
test whether ship electronics can withstand a nuclear blast in
space.
   ``We've started a very active public information and
availability program on the Gulf Coast,'' said Capt. W.E. Mahew,
manager of the Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment
Simulator For Ships (Empress II) program.
   ``There was too much misinformation about what the program was
(when it was proposed for the Chesapeake Bay) and we were never
able to counter that information,'' he said. ``The guy who got
there first and told the story first was the only who was
believed.''
   Empress II consists of a barge-mounted, truncated cone of
antennas _ 128 feet high and 200 feet in diameter _ that surround a
pulser which can simulate the electromagnetic field that would be
generated by a nuclear blast in space.
   The system generates an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) that lasts
just 10 billionths of a second, but measures 50,000 volts per meter
at 100 meters from the barge in all directions. The EMP is fired at
passing ships to test the effectiveness of measures designed to
protect electronics systems from the EMP that would be generated by
a nuclear blast in space.
   While the Navy insists that the EMP generated by Empress II
poses no risk to the environment and that exclusion zones around
the barge will protect the electronic systems of nearby planes and
boats, it has had a difficult time thus far making its case.
   ``They just have not accurately assessed the impact of this on
human health, and what makes this particularly sad is that most of
the people being exposed are people in the service,'' said Andrew
Kimbrell, an attorney for the Foundation on Economic Trends.
   ``What we're seeing here is similar to the Army allowing those
soldiers to be exposed to the first nuclear blasts (after World War
II) and we know the high incidence of cancer that resulted there,''
he said.
   The foundation, a Washington-based watchdog group on emerging
technologies, has filed suit in U.S. District Court seeking to halt
Empress II tests off the coast of North Carolina until the Navy
adequately assesses the impact of the tests on human health and
animal life and on the electronic circuitry of nearby airplanes and
boats.
   The Navy began operating the Empress II off North Carolina in
the summer of 1988 after Congress enacted legislation prohibiting
it from operating in the Chesapeake Bay until the Navy demonstrated
that the tests could be conducted no where else with less
environmental impact.
   After the lawsuit was filed, the Navy chose a new site off North
Carolina and conducted an environmental assessment that concluded
the Empress II tests would have no significant environmental impact
at the new site. As soon as the 30-day period for public comment on
that assessment ended last month, the Navy resumed the Empress II
tests at the new site.
   In the meantime, letters went out July 26 announcing that the
Navy planned to begin the environmental assessment that could lead
to a new test site for Empress II about 20 miles off the
Alabama-Mississippi coast in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Mahew said the Navy needs the Gulf site because weather
conditions limit use of the North Carolina site to the summer
months. Originally, winter testing was to have been conducted in
the Chesapeake Bay. He said the Navy is planning 60 days of Empress
II tests in the Gulf annually between October and April.
   Long before plans for the Gulf site were announced, however,
Mahew said Navy personnel were meeting with state and local
officials and environmental groups in Alabama, Mississippi and
Louisiana in order to ``get ahead of the opposition.''
   ``We're laying it all out,'' he said. In four years of Naval and
independent research on the effects of EMP, he argues, ``We've
never been able to demonstrate any harm to human health, we've
never been able to demonstrate any harm to marine biota.''
   Despite those claims, and despite its best public relations
efforts, the Navy appears to be facing a long legal battle before
it can pursue its plan for year-round Empress II tests in the
Atlantic and the Gulf.
   ``I'm not an expert in the politics of the region,'' Kimbrell
said when asked to assess the prospects of the Navy winning the
public acceptance for Empress II in Alabama and Mississippi that
eluded it in Virginia and Maryland.
   ``However, they won't have any better legal atmosphere because
they're still going to have to comply with what is a federal law,
the National Environmental Policy Act,'' he said.

   Friends and colleagues, some in tears, streamed
into the downtown Houston office of Rep. Mickey Leland on Sunday
morning as news spread that wreckage of the Texas congressman's
plane was discovered in Ethiopia.
   U.S. officials said there were no survivors.
   ``This is a very difficult time for Houston. We have lost one of
our most important leaders, and I've lost a very good friend,''
said Rep. Mike Andrews, his voice breaking.
   Andrews, like Leland a Houston Democrat, was among the first to
arrive at the office after word came that supporters' hopes that
Leland and his entourage had somehow survived since Monday had
proven futile.
   ``I know our prayers and thoughts are with his family, his wife,
their young son, and soon-to-be new baby,'' Andrews said. ``Mickey
Leland was a very special person. I will miss him very much.''
   Leland's wife, Alison, was in seclusion Sunday morning at their
Houston home and planned to make a statement later in the day, a
spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, Leland staff members were closeted in his
eighth-floor offices at a downtown Houston skyscraper. People could
be seen hugging and crying in the office. Volunteers delivered
coffee and soft drinks to aides who had kept a vigil at the office.
   ``It's very somber, very sad. They are still in shock,'' said
Kippy Caraway, who was helping Leland's staff.
   State Rep. Harold Dutton, a friend of Leland's since childhood,
was in the office off and on all night, and was there when the call
came in that the wreckage had been found.
   ``We got a call from our Washington office around 6,'' Dutton
said, his voice wavering. ``As you can well imagine, it's pretty
somber up there. A lot of people are calling in and expressing
their sentiments.''
   Paul Joseph, a family friend and consultant for food-lifts to
African countries, said: ``Mickey Leland has made the supreme
sacrifice as a humanitarian. Only good can come from him.''
   ``We've lost a real leader, and real leaders in our political
world are few and far between,'' said Bill Ramsey, a Democratic
Party consultant and friend who had been frequently at Leland's
office in the past week.
   ``I guess everyone was hoping it would not come out this way,''
said John Odom, a Leland friend and Democratic candidate for
attorney general.
   ``At a personal level, I've lost a friend. But more than that,
he was an international leader, and it will be difficult if not
impossible to replace him,'' Odom said.

   Breaking a revered Italian custom, the culture
minister has ordered state-run museums to remain open on August 15,
a national holiday.
   In past years tourists have had to put up with almost everything
in Italy being shut down on the national holiday, called
``Ferragosto.''
   The new culture minister, Ferdinando Facchiano, said the museums
should stay open so foreign tourists and others could enjoy Italy's
art.
   However, one of Italy's most famous museums, the Uffizi Gallery
in Florence, may be closed. Its employees have threatened to strike
from Monday to Wednesday, saying the work order violates an
agreement on opening hours on holidays.

   Lightning set oil tanks ablaze at an oil depot in

firefighters were killed, at least 12 people were missing and 86
injured.
   Fires were extinguished in five tanks by Sunday night, about 36
hours after the fire started, leaving one tank still ablaze, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Premier Li Peng flew Sunday morning to the burning Huangdao
depot, about 350 miles southeast of Beijing, to encourage the
firefighters, it said.
   The central government sent 20 tons of dry ice and 100 fire
engines to the scene, and the navy's North China Sea fleet sent
hydroplanes and lifeboats to help.
   The depot is located on an island nearly five miles from the
urban area, Xinhua said.
   The fire broke out at about 10 a.m. Saturday when lightning
struck one tank, then spread to other tanks Saturday afternoon, it
said. The burning tanks contained a total of 40,000 tons of crude
oil.
   National television news said 12 people were missing and 86
injured, but Xinhua said 16 were missing and 64 injured. Both
reports said five people were killed.
   Local officials did not answer their telephones Sunday afternoon.

<TEXT>
   At 6 p.m., it was a rumor. By 8 p.m., it
was a sellout. By midnight, it was a memory.
   The Rolling Stones commandeered a small club Saturday for a
surprise start to their 1989 tour, ending their exile at a vacant
girls school by rocking for 700 fans with good connections to the
rumor mill who paid $3 apiece for an hourlong, greatest
hits-dominated set.
   ``Thank you. Good, good, good. We've been playing for ourselves
the last six weeks,'' Mick Jagger told the screaming crowd at the
Stones' first U.S. appearance in eight years. He was referring to
the group's weeks of rehearsals at the Wykeham Rise School in rural
Washington, Conn.
   While the Stones were the stars Saturday night, everybody inside
Toad's Place was eager to grab a bit of the spotlight with stories
detailing leaks about the ``secret concert.''
   A 50-ish woman came with her tuxedoed husband, who worked
security at Wykeham; it was their first time (and probably last,
she said) seeing the Stones. A friend of a friend of the Stones'
masseuse provided another tip. A local 21-year-old got a phone call
at 6:50 p.m. Saturday from a buddy who heard the buzz near the club.
   David Foster of Boston was visiting his girlfriend, Linda, in
New Haven when a friend called. He had just seen the owner of
Toad's in a liquor store stocking up on Rebel Yell, Keith Richards'
whiskey of choice, which was enough to confirm the rumor for them.
   ``I have tickets to see them at Foxboro (Mass.). I think I'll
give them to the needy,'' said a suddenly benevolent Foster. ``Why
fight 80,000 people after you've seen 'em with 300?''
   Outside, the word spread: The Stones were coming. The crowd
ignored the sign outside announcing the previously scheduled bill:
``Tonight. Rock Dance Party with the Cruiser. Admission $3.01.'' By
8 p.m., the doors were closed as latecomers sprinted down York
Street in a vain effort to get in.
   ``It's happening, man. They're here,'' said one depressed fan.
Another offered $20 to anyone on the guest list who could smuggle
him in, but he found no takers. Still more looked for unattended
doors behind the club, hoping to slip in. Eventually, several
hundred people filled the quiet block near the Yale campus.
   Inside, the crowd was a mix of New York chic and Ivy League
prep. Yalies in sweatshirts rubbed shoulders with black-clad
Manhattanites, some of whom appeared stunned by the ways of
suburban club life.
   ``You've got to PAY for drinks?'' asked one incredulous
scene-maker, his eyes growing large behind tinted shades, after
picking up his rum and Coke.
   Why New Haven? ``It was a thank-you to Connecticut for the
hospitality,'' explained harried Stones tour publicist Lynn Tanzman.
   The decision was made at the last minute. Toad's co-owner Brian
Phelps said he was called Friday about the show, setting off a
whirlwind 24 hours.
   The band played 11 songs in 56 minutes: ``Start Me Up,''
``Bitch,'' ``Tumbling Dice,'' ``Sad, Sad, Sad'' (new album), ``Miss
You,'' ``Little Red Rooster,'' ``Honky Tonk Women,'' ``Mixed
Emotions'' (new single), ``It's Only Rock and Roll,'' ``Brown
Sugar'' and ``Jumping Jack Flash.'' Two keyboardists and three
background vocalists rounded out the band.
   ``Great. Exciting. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. The blues at its
best,'' exulted Andy Broughal, 21, one of the select first 700 of
the expected 3 million fans who will see the Stones. The tour
resumes in Philadelphia on Aug. 31.
   By an hour after the show, things were back to normal. Bouncers
asked for two forms of ID, not required if you were on the guest
list. The piped-in music was back on, Charlie Watts' drum kit taken
down. The block-long line outside was gone.
   Phelps, after the biggest night in his club's 14-year history,
had just one regret.
   ``I never met 'em. At one point, I was downstairs with 'em
before the show, but they were into their own thing,'' he said.
``And 10 minutes after the show, they were gone.''

   Rep. Mickey Leland, never freed of his torment
over a dying girl in Ethiopia years ago, was drawn again and again
to the place he called ``the end of the Earth.''
   George Thomas ``Mickey'' Leland, a six-term Houston Democrat and
chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, was on his fifth
visit to refugee camps near the Sudan border when the plane
carrying his party crashed.
   The wreckage was found Sunday, six days after the plane vanished
after taking off in bad weather from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian
capital, and heading for the Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles
southwest.
   Although there were no immediate positive identifications of the
bodies found by paramedics dropped from a helicopter, rescuers said
no one could have survived the fiery crash.
   President Bush quickly expressed condolences to the 44-year-old
congressman's wife as well as to the families and friends of those
``who died with him'' on what the president called a ``noble
cause.''
   It was in 1985 when Leland recalled standing in a refugee camp
10 months earlier and asking a relief official about a little girl
``who looked to be about 70 or 80 years old _ a skeleton of a
person with a thin layer of brown skin draped on her, who had just
a faint breath of life in her.''
   ``While I was talking to him, she died. I can see her face right
now. Every day I see her face,'' Leland said at the time.
   Twice chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Leland
evolved, by his own account, from a firebrand ``black activist,''
to an ``activist on behalf of humanity everywhere, whether it is in
Ethiopia, South Africa, Chile, in any part of the world where
people are desperate and hungry for the freedoms and rights they
deserve as human beings.''
   His deeds reflected the breadth of that concern. Just as he
pressed for famine relief in Africa, he fought as relentlessly to
feed the homeless in the United States. He went to Vietnam to
retrieve three children for their families in America. Last
October, he went to Cuba, where he helped negotiate the release of
three political prisoners and their families.
   In a bid to bridge festering hostility between black and Jewish
communities, he supervised for 10 years a program under which poor
black kids from Houston were sent to Israel for six weeks to learn
about the Jewish culture and heritage.
   A Roman Catholic, Leland once bicycled through Israel and often
cited the Talmud, the Jewish commentary on the Old Testament. ``If
you save one life, you save the whole world,'' was his favorite
passage.
   ``He's someone who cared and made a difference ... a militant
man who found he could change the system more from the inside than
the outside,'' said Rep. Gary L. Ackerman, D-N.Y., who served with
Leland on the hunger committee and thrice joined him on trips to
Ethiopia.
   After offering that assessment of his friend, Ackerman went to
Ethiopia to join the search. He was aboard the Air Force helicopter
that found the wreckage.
   When Leland moved from the Texas Legislature to Congress in
1979, replacing the retired Rep. Barbara Jordan, he almost
immediately began pushing for a special committee on world hunger.
Even after he recited the horrors he witnessed in a 1983 trip to
Ethiopia, he was opposed by people who argued yet another select
committee was a waste of money, and by those who viewed it as an
infringement of their own turf _ foreign relations, agriculture and
appropriations.
   Leland wouldn't back off. Instead, he rallied all the volunteer
organizations concerned with hunger, and enlisted the help of
celebrities like Valerie Harper, John Denver and Cliff Robertson.
House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., D-Mass., lent his prestige.
Leland invited members of the established committees to join his
unofficial caucus on hunger. Finally, in the spring of 1984, he got
his committee _ and the momentum that resulted in $800 million for
famine relief the following fiscal year. He personally convinced
President Reagan to divert a ship loaded with food to Ethiopia.
   As a member of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications, he repeatedly tangled with the television
networks over black representation, on and off camera, in their
shows. A year before Diahann Carrol and Billy Dee Williams appeared
on ``Dynasty,'' he needled ABC executives about why the show didn't
have any black characters.
   Leland said he learned his values from his mother, a teacher who
had put herself through school working as a short-order cook. As a
pharmacy student at Texas Southern University, he joined a
volunteer group which operated free health clinics. He was drawn,
too, to the Black Panther Party, which also operated free clinics
and gave breakfasts to needy black children.
   His political influences ranged from Stokely Carmichael, to
Malcolm X, to Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, and he eventually
formed his own Black Community Action Team, known as the Black
Cats, and helped establish three health clinics in Houston. Texas
conservatives assailed him a radical, an image not helped during
his days in the state legislature by his seven-inch Afro, a leather
shoulder bag, and his dashikis _ long since replaced by three-piece
business suits.
   ``I never considered myself to be a radical because I fought for
the rights of human beings,'' he said. In 1972, in his first race
for public office, he was elected to the Texas House, where he
championed health issues, included a generic-drug law over the
stiff lobbying of the pharmaceutical lobby.
   When he ran for Congress in 1978, he had no Republican
opposition and defeated a Socialist Workers Party candidate with
more than 96 percent of the vote. He won re-election five times
with similar ease, despite a 1988 primary challenge from Elizabeth
Spates, who charged that Leland had lost touch with constituents
while seeking national exposure as spokesman for the hungry and
homeless.
   ``There's people I've not touched in a long time,'' he
acknowledged. ``I have been on the road quite a bit.''
   But he earned respect even from staunch conservatives like
Illinois Rep. Henry J. Hyde, the ranking Republican on the House
Select Committee on Intelligence, who recently wrote in the Houston
Chronicle that Leland's ``personal diplomacy'' with Ethiopian and
Sudanese officials ``opened up life-sustaining corridors in the
border region between the two countries _ a peaceful (relief)
supply route.''
   Leland, who also served on the Committee on Post Office and
Civil Service, often thrust himself into the position of mediator
in matters of international or inter-racial consequence.
   He was closer to Cuban President Fidel Castro than any other
member of Congress. ``While I disagree with his fundamental
ideology, I respect him for his intellect,'' Leland said. Castro
returned that sentiment, and Leland was often tapped to open
avenues of communication between the United States and Cuba.
   In April, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations paid
special tribute to his work in uniting blacks and Jews.
   In the 1984 Democratic presidential primary, Leland supported
former Vice President Walter Mondale over the Rev. Jesse Jackson,
angering many of his black colleagues in the process.
   But Jackson chose Leland as one of the top four fund-raisers in
his 1988 presidential campaign, and praised the ``consistent streak
of humanity in Mickey Leland'' during an election year trip to
Houston.
   Leland often had been mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate
in Houston. Despite his political roots, he maintained a close
relationship with the city's business establishment, and he and his
wife, Alison, and their son, Jarret, shared a fashionable home in
an upscale neighborhood.
   The Americans for Democratic Action called him a ``liberal
hero'' early this year, and Leland relished the label despite the
bashing that many fellow Democrats took over the ``L word'' in last
year's presidential campaign.
   ``Some of use are not afraid to be called liberal and
progressive, and to continue to fight for our place in the sun,''
he said. ``Eventually, we'll get there.''

<HEAD>Christians Repulse Syrian Offensive; 19 Killed in Beirut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian fighters on Sunday fought off a
Syrian assault on a major Christian stronghold near Beirut, and
fighting in the capital killed at least 19 people and trapped
scores more in burning buildings.
   The attack on the Souk el-Gharb garrison in the mountains
overlooking Beirut was the first time the Syrians and their allies
have tried to push into the Christian heartland since March 8, when
the latest round of violence began in the civil war.
   ``This is a sterling victory,'' the Christian army commander,
Gen. Michel Aoun, said on Voice of Lebanon radio. ``The Syrian
enemy and its surrogates have been dealt a crushing defeat.''
   As Aoun claimed victory, Druse leader Walid Jumblatt canceled a
news conference at which he had been expected to announce the
capture of Souk el-Gharb.
   Police confirmed the Christians repulsed the Syrian-led attack.
   About 2,100 Syrian troops, Druse militiamen and radical
Palestinian guerrillas, backed by tanks and armored personnel
carriers, attacked the one-time resort, which controls a network of
roads twisting through the mountains of central Lebanon.
   A Christian army communique claimed 150 Syrians were killed in
five hours of fighting. But a senior army source said 10 Syrians,
20 Druse and 20 Palestinians were confirmed killed.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to give
army casualties but said there were ``plenty.''
   He said another 12 Syrians were killed in fighting along
Beirut's Green Line, which divides the city into Christian and
Moslem sectors. There was no word from the Syrians, who rarely
announce their losses.
   The fall of Souk el-Gharb would have been a major setback for
the Christians. Its loss would leave the Christian suburbs of
Baabda and Yarze, where the bulk of Christian forces and armor are
deployed, vulnerable to attack.
   Aoun lives in a bunker under the shell-blasted presidential
palace in Baabda. His senior aides are based in the Defense
Ministry compound in Yarze.
   Aoun warned that with the attack on Souk el-Gharb, the Syrians
were expected to escalate their ``barbaric bombardment'' of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said at least 19 people were killed and 80 wounded in
Beirut, a virtual ghost town since the bulk of its 1.5 million
residents began fleeing the fighting.
   ``Where are our Arab brethren?'' screamed an announcer over the
Christian Voice of Lebanon radio.
   ``Beirut is being wiped off the face of earth as if by an
earthquake. Our wounded are bleeding to death in the streets and in
basements,'' she said, her voice choking with emotion.
   ``It's World War III here,'' cab drvier Bashir Harakeh said in a
telephone call from a shelter in Moslem Bourj el-Barajneh.
   The casualty count Sunday did not include dozens of civilians
buried in shell-wrecked apartment blocks or trapped in basements of
burning buildings.
   Even if firefighters could get past the rubble to reach the
buildings, they could not put out the flames because the city's
water pumping system was destroyed three weeks ago.
   Many people lay bleeding in the streets, because rescue teams
could not reach them.
   Since the duels began March 8, 641 people have been killed and
1,713 wounded. That does not include casualties from the Souk
el-Gharb battle or the Syrian deaths reported along the Green Line.
   The duels began after Aoun blockaded illegal militia-run ports,
which reportedly were costing the government $1 million a year in
lost customs dues.
   The Syrians retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave.
   Police said about 400 Syrian guns and multi-barrelled rocket
launchers began blasting the Christian heartland at dusk Saturday
in one of the most intense bombardments since March.
   The barrage continued through Sunday.
   The Syrians used Soviet-designed BM-21 rocket launchers, which
can fire 40 projectiles a minute, as well as 180mm and 240mm
mortars.
   Aoun's gunners hit back with an estimated 25,000 rounds of 130mm
mortar and 155mm howitzer fire against Syrian artillery positions
along west Beirut's beaches, police said.
   They also blasted Syrian supply routes through the Bekaa Valley
in east Lebanon.
   Three shells hit the Turkish Embassy in Baabda, causing damage
but no casualties. French Ambassador Rene Ala's residence in Yarze
was damaged, police said.
   The Hotel Dieu Hospital in east Beirut and west Beirut's Barbir
Hospital were hit, but patients and staff had taken shelter in
underground bunkers.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross appealed for a
cease-fire, claiming the number of casualties was ``increasing hour
by hour.''
   The United States, France and the Arab League have appealed for
a cease-fire. France dispatched envoys to Arab capitals, including
Damascus, Syria, seeking diplomatic action.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun maintains they betrayed that
mandate when they sided the Moslems in the war.
   Syria refuses to negotiate with Aoun, who has vowed to drive the
Syrians out of Lebanon.

   With the government distracted
by a damaging leadership struggle, anti-apartheid activists said
Sunday the next phases of their nationwide defiance campaign wil
include challenges to segregation of beaches and schools.
   The defiance campaign, launched Aug. 2 when blacks and Indians
peacefully sought treatment at segregated white hospitals, has been
condemned by the National Party government as an attempt to provoke
confrontation and violence.
   Since Friday, however, top government officials have been
preoccupied by a dispute between President P.W. Botha and Education
Minister F.W. de Klerk, who heads the National Party and is
expected to succeed Botha after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.
   Botha, 73, brought the long-running rift into the open when he
announced Friday he had not been consulted about de Klerk's planned
meeting on Aug. 28 with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, a
prominent critic of South Africa's racial policies.
   De Klerk conferred with his Cabinet colleagues on Saturday and
reportedly obtained full backing from them heading into a formal
Cabinet meeting with Botha on Monday.
   Political writers said de Klerk was likely to demand that Botha
stop interfering in government affairs pending his retirement next
month. Botha could accept the ultimatum, quit immediately, or try
to fire de Klerk and other ministers, newspapers suggested.
   In any case, Foreign Minister Pik Botha has said he and de Klerk
will keep their appointment with Kaunda.
   The Sunday Star of Johannesburg described Botha as ``an unguided
missile trying to inflict maximum damage before the September
elections'' and warned in an editorial that his ``childish rage''
could jeopardize important diplomatic initiatives.
   City Press, the country's largest-selling newspaper for blacks,
headlined its lead editorial Sunday: ``In the name of God, P.W.
Botha, please go!''
   Groups affiliated with the Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition
organizing the protests, said they planned to defy beach
segregation laws in the port city of Durban and demand integration
of ``whites-only'' schools in racially mixed inner-city
neighborhoods.
   Organizers were quoted by the City Press and other papers as
saying they did not want to reveal too many details at this stage,
but they said a mass rally was planned for next Sunday at one of
the remaining whites-only beaches in Durban.
   Plans also were announced for a meeting Thursday in Johannesburg
to launch a campaign called ``All schools for all people'' to
protest segregation of government schools. The Sunday Star said
blacks living in central Johannesburg will be encouraged to take
their children to under-utilized white schools near their homes.
   Several inner-city neighborhoods have became racially mixed in
recent years as the government eased enforcement of residential
segregation laws. But black children in these areas must travel
long distances to outlying black townships if they wish to attend
public schools.
   In another development, 11 white policemen were scheduled to
appear in court Monday to face armed robbery charges after they
allegedly robbed black entrepreneurs in several townships near
Johannesburg.
   Police have released only a few details about the case and said
that ``senstive'' investigations were continuing following the
arrests last week.
   Local press reports said the suspects, all in their 20s, had
targeted the owners of licensed and unlicensed taverns in the
townships and had stolen at least $40,000 over a four-month period.
The constables reportedly told their victims they were members of
the White Wolves, a name which has surfaced in recent months in
connection with acts of terror by white right-wing extremists.
   Police officials have insisted there is no evidence the White
Wolves actually exists.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Government and Contras Disagree Over Arms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan government and the Contras
disagree on a key issue of the new Central American peace proposal,
with a rebel spokesman saying Sunday the combatants would return to
their homeland carrying their guns.
   ``Our men are going to go into Nicaragua armed,'' Adolfo Calero,
a leader of the Nicaraguan Resistance said Sunday on ABC's ``This
Week With David Brinkley.''
   Alejandro Bendana, a Nicaraguan foreign ministry official and
also a guest on the show, said: ``They don't need guns at this
point.''
   The presidents of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica
and Guatemala signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling for the
demobilization and disbanding of the Contra rebels by early
December. The Contras, backed by the United States since 1981, have
been fighting to oust the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.
   The plan does not mention the mechanics for disarming the
rebels. It calls for an International Commission of Support and
Verification to aid the Contras in resettling in their homeland or
a third country. The Honduran government, which hosts the majority
of more than 10,000 combatants, has said the rebels must leave
their base camps near the Nicaraguan border.
   Calero cited his distrust for the Sandinista government and a
March 1988 bilateral agreement for saying the rebels who return to
Nicaragua should carry their weapons, largely supplied by the
United States. The 1988 accord, which never was put into place
because of disagreements, would have allowed the Contra combatants
to hold on to their arms in special zones set up inside Nicaragua.
   ``We have to realize the Sandinistas have lied, deceived, broken
promises all along,'' Calero said.
   Bendana said: ``The Contras can come back in. There is an
amnesty in place. ... The point is they don't need guns at this
point.''
   Asked about Bendana's assurances, Calero smiled, saying: ``It's
a lie,'' and he called for the demobilization of the Sandinista
army, which stands at about 80,000-strong and is the largest in
Central America.
   ``Contra commanders who are living in Miami condominiums really
don't command that much respect from Contra foot soldiers,''
Bendana said.
   ``Why should any standing, legal government want to demobilize
its force to protect itself?'' he said when pushed on the
demobilization question. ``Once the war is over we want to go back
to normalcy.''
   Calero said the agreement by the Central American presidents was
a disappointment.
   ``We feel that we've been let down by the United States and by
the Central American presidents who should know better,'' he said,
adding the United States ``could have lobbied harder, they could
have shown more support so that our forces would remain in place
until after the elections as the only guarantee for free elections
in Nicaragua.''
   The Nicaraguan government has scheduled general elections for
February.
   Bendana said his government would ``use every political, legal,
and moral means at our disposal to try to persuade these people to
come in within the civic, within the legal arena.''
   ``Let's slug it out on the radio stations and the newspapers,
openly, in political rallies, by way of political platforms put
before the Nicaraguan people so the Nicaraguan people and not the
United States and not at the point of a gun, can decide what kind
of government they want on February 25th, under international
observation,'' the Nicaraguan official added.
   Some 50,000 Nicaraguans, many of them civilians, have been
killed in the fighting in the rural northern mountains and central
plains.

   The army's chief spokesman said Sunday he
refuses to accept that two Israeli soldiers taken captive in
Lebanon were killed, despite a British news report that they have
been dead more than three years.
   ``My consideration is that they are alive and we must do our
utmost to bring them home,'' Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid told a news
conference.
   He refused to confirm or deny the report in the Sunday Times of
London that Israeli investigators who questioned a kidnapped Moslem
Shiite clergyman have concluded the two Israeli soldiers are dead.
   `We consider our prisoners of war ... as living until positive
evidence proves the contrary,'' Lapid said.
   Israeli officials have offered to trade the cleric and hundreds
of other Moslem Shiite prisoners held by Israel for the two Israeli
infantrymen, an Israeli airman, and the 16 Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   Lebanese Shiite leaders have called for Israel to first release
its prisoners and let Palestinian deportees return to the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Lapid's news conference was called after the London newspaper
report gained widespread attention in the Israeli media.
   The British weekly quoted unidentified security sources in
Jerusalem as saying Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has tried to keep
the two deaths a secret from the United States to avoid pressure to
free the cleric in exchange only for Western hostages.
   Israeli commandos on July 28 abducted the radical Shiite cleric,
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid. Israel says he is a leader of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, which is believed to be an
umbrella for groups holding Western hostages.
   The Sunday Times quoted unidentified senior Israeli government
sources as saying Obeid's interrogators believe the infantrymen,
Yousef Fink and Rahamim Alsheik, died of wounds within hours after
their car was ambushed in south Lebanon in February 1986.
   The London weekly said the Israeli airman, Ron Arad, who was
shot down in October 1986, is believed to be alive and held by a
Lebanese militia with closer ties to Syria than Iran.
   The newspaper said Israeli military officials had told the
parents of Fink and Alsheik that their sons were dead. The Israeli
daily Yediot Ahronot quoted both families as denying the report.
   There are 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Maury Povich, host of the TV program ``A
Current Affair,'' and his studio audience have learned to what
lengths comedian Tom Arnold will go to to express his devotion to
fiancee Roseanne Barr.
   Asked by Povich during a recent taping of the show if he had any
message for the nation's media, Arnold dropped his pants and
exposed his backside, revealing a tattoo that read ``Rosey.''
   The interview was to be broadcast Monday, but it wasn't
immediately clear if the backside shot would be shown.
   Arnold told Povich that he and Ms. Barr would wed in January. He
also said the star of the TV series was not surprised that she was
recently passed over for an Emmy nomination for her hit TV series
``Roseanne.''
   Arnold said reports that Ms. Barr offered some men $50 to rough
up a photographer were true, but that it was a joke.
   ``But she would never have anybody beat up because I know she
could do it herself. I mean, why would she pay?'' he said.

   Former President Ronald Reagan will take a
break in writing his memoirs with a September trip to the East
Coast to receive a special United Nations medal for his peace
efforts, his spokesman said.
   The trip will also feature a Reagan speech before the United Way
charities, presentation of an award at West Point and a luncheon in
his honor sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange.
   The Business Council for the United Nations medal will be
presented to Reagan during the 23rd annual United Nations
Ambassadors' Dinner on Sept. 20, spokesman Mark Weinberg said
Friday.
   Reagan is being honored for his ``outstanding contributions to
the attainment of lasting world peace,'' the United Nations
organization said. Last year, the first time it was presented, the
medal was given to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

   Singer-songwriter Julian Lennon says he's learned
to separate himself from the legend of his late father, John Lennon
of the Beatles, and wishes other people would, too.
   ``I've only basically come to terms with it in the last two or
three years after throwing myself into this industry,'' said
Lennon, 26, who is touring to promote his third album, ``Mr.
Jordan,'' and performed here Saturday. ``I didn't feel the pressure
of being someone's son. People would ask, `How do you feel about
this shadow?' There was no shadow for me.
   ``Basically, what people were saying is I'm not good enough to
take Dad's place. I'm not in competition with my father, not inside
my heart.
   ``They want Dad around. I wish they'd wake up. There's a few too
many people living in the past,'' he said. ``I've woken up and I'm
looking after myself. It's about bloody time.''

   Singer Mary Travers says the audience for the
veteran folk trio Peter, Paul &amp; Mary is spreading across
generations.
   ``There's something very special about looking down in the front
rows and seeing a father and his daughter both singing `Puff, the
Magic Dragon,''' she said.
   Ms. Travers, a grandmother now, told the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram that the group tries to do about 60 concerts a year
and still relies on an all-acoustic sound.
   ``Two guitars, a bass and three voices,'' she said in an
interview before a Dallas concert. ``Seems like enough to me.''

   Nancy Reagan dropped plans to put a drug
treatment center in a local neighborhood after residents
complained, but says that doesn't mean she has said no to fighting
the war against drugs.
   The anti-drug effort remains her principal concern, the
68-year-old former first lady said in a recent interview, and she
recently established her own foundation dedicated to the cause.
   Mrs. Reagan attempted to locate a Nancy Reagan Center in the
Lake View Terrace area that would have been operated by the
non-profit drug abuse agency Phoenix House. The center had received
more than $4.5 million in donations and pledges, but residents of
the area 25 miles northwest of downtown vehemently opposed it.
   ``The last thing I wanted (was) to upset the community,'' she
said.
   The new Nancy Reagan Foundation has written to drug education
and treatment programs in the Los Angeles area, urging them to
apply for varying matching grants. ``I am going to give (and) will
be giving money to places that I think need it,'' Mrs. Reagan said.

   Singer Steve Earle says he won't leave
his country music roots behind just because of the rock 'n' roll
success of his song ``Copperhead Road'' and the opportunity to tour
with Bob Dylan.
   ``I don't really think of myself in terms of a rock star,''
Earle, 34, said in a recent interview from his hometown of San
Antonio, Texas. ``I still feel like a hillbilly singer with
delusions of grandeur.''
   The ``Copperhead Road'' album, his third, has sold 900,000
copies worldwide.
   Earle is traveling with his band, the Dukes, as the opening act
for Dylan's 1989 tour. But that doesn't mean he socializes with
Dylan, who travels in his own bus.
   ``I've talked to him one time,'' Earle said. ``He comes in right
before he plays, there's one encore and he steps onto the bus and
he's gone.''

<HEAD>Walesa to Meet Kiszczak, May Be Prime Minister Candidate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Sunday
he plans to meet communist Prime Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak in
the near future, and a Solidarity official said Walesa might
himself be willing to head Poland's next government.
   In comments relayed by an aide in the Baltic port of Gdansk,
Walesa said, ``I do not want to, nor should I be prime minister. I
have my own candidates.''
   But Senator Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Walesa's envoy in talks with two
minor parties on formation of a Solidarity-led coalition
government, said Sunday of Walesa, ``it is true he is considering''
becoming prime minister.
   The opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza had raised the
possibility of Walesa's becoming prime minister last week, and
another Solidarity lawmaker, Senator Aleksander Paszynski, said it
was raised in talks with the other parties.
   Walesa left his home in Gdansk Sunday afternoon for Warsaw,
where on Monday he was expected to take part in coalition talks
with political leaders of the other parties in parliament.
   Replying to the appeal of newly elected Prime Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak, who announced Saturday he wanted to meet Walesa
``as soon as possible,'' Walesa said he too wants such a meeting.
   ``I will meet with Gen. Kiszczak in the nearest future ... We
cannot avoid difficult topics,'' Walesa said, according to the aide.
   Kiszczak was elected prime minister Aug. 2, but his efforts to
form a government ran into trouble four days later when Walesa
announced he would oppose any government formed by the longtime
interior minister.
   Solidarity senator Kaczynski said Walesa authorized him to
conduct talks with the Democratic Party and the Peasants Party, two
small parties that hold the balance of power in the parliament
because Solidarity and the communists each have less than 50
percent of the seats.
   The talks that began Thursday continued through the weekend at
an undisclosed site, Kaczynski said, speaking by telephone from his
home in Warsaw.
   ``They are conducted amid different difficulties with good will
on all three sides,'' he said. The Democrats and the Peasants were
leaning toward the idea of a coalition with Solidarity, he said,
but that there was no way to say where those talks would lead.
   Peasant Party deputies have said voters reacted badly to the
choice of Kiszczak as prime minister, the election of Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski to the new post of president and the selection of former
prime minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as the new head of the
communist party.
   The reshuffle at the top leaves the impression among voters that
nothing has changed despite Solidarity's victory at the polls in
June, when union-backed candidates swept all 161 seats open to the
opposition in the 460-member Sejm and 99 of 100 seats in the newly
created Senate.
   ``If one recognizes that these elections were really won by the
opposition, then it should be ready to take over the government,''
said Solidarity member Paszynski in a telephone interview.
   Walesa was a ``logical'' candidate for prime minister, even
though he is not an expert on the economy, he said.
   The political stalemate at the top echelons of power and growing
frustration over steep price hikes Aug. 1 and soaring inflation has
frustrated Poles, prompting a number of work stoppages in protest
over economic chaos.
   Solidarity says the new government must have public support in
order to be able to rule _ backing that a communist-led coalition
will be unable to achieve.
   Communist leaders have repeatedly urged Solidarity to join a
so-called ``grand coalition'' in which the opposition would be
offered several ministries, but Solidarity has declined, saying
that option would change nothing.
   But the prospect of a non-communist led government appears to
have disconcerted Poland's main Warsaw Pact ally.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry official in Moscow on Friday
criticized attempts to use the formation of the Polish government
``for destabilizing the sitution in the country,'' according to the
Tass news agency.

   Housing the nearly 1,000 magicians who
gathered for a weekend convention was no easy trick.
   There are nearly as many magicians as there are residents during
the 52nd annual Abbott Magic Get-Together in Colon.
   ``We don't have any hotels in town,'' said housing coordinator
Debbie Bordner. Some magicians end up staying in Battle Creek or
Kalamazoo, 35 to 40 miles away from the hometown of Abbott Magic
Co., which organizes the gathering.
   Over the years, many have found lodging with Herman and Helmine
Oldenberg, both 72, who have opened their home to as many as 20 of
the visiting tricksters.
   ``We only have one shower so they have to line up for a
shower,'' Oldenberg said.
   ``And I don't understand our hot water heater,'' Mrs. Oldenberg
added. ``It never runs out of water.''
   Last year, Oldenberg said, we had six upstairs, three in the
basement, two on the patio, two in the camper trailer, four in the
truck camper and three in their own camper out front.'' This year,
they are housing five.

   The DeMarco family hasn't run into any
big problems in the first month of a covered-wagon journey from
Ohio to California, but the five children are getting a bit
restless.
   ``Every day (2{-year-old) Martina will ask, `Are we going to
California today? Are we there yet?' The kids don't have the same
conception of time and distance,'' said Pam DeMarco.
   She and her husband, Thomas-Angelo, passed through Knightstown,
30 miles east of Indianapolis, last week in their tractor-drawn
Conestoga-style wagon, chosen to symbolize their search fo a better
life.
   The DeMarcos, recently of Kipton, Ohio, built the covered wagon
for cheap transportation and as a protest against 20th century
lifestyles.
   ``A lot of people come up and say, `I envy you,''' said DeMarco,
37. ``They say to my wife, `You can leave your refrigerator and
washing machine and not know where you're going to stay.' Hey, a
quarter million people went west in covered wagons.''
   They hope to reach Southern California, where they have friends,
by Christmas. They hope to buy a farm one day.
   An Air Force veteran and woodworker by trade, DeMarco says his
business was failing last year and he was forced to vacate a home
he had been restoring. Mrs. DeMarco, an American history buff,
suggested the family move west by covered wagon, and they pieced
the vehicle together from an old farm wagon and other salvaged
parts.
   ``People come up and have some innate sense of why we're doing
this,'' DeMarco said. ``They say things like, `You must love
America.' Yeah, that's right.''

<HEAD>Bennett Says Drug Users, Not Government, Blame for Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug users, rather than failed government
policies, are to blame for the spread of drugs throughout society,
drug policy director William J. Bennett said Sunday.
   He also defended the Reagan administration's efforts to combat
drugs, including former First Lady Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No''
campaign.
   Bennett by law must forward a new national strategy for fighting
drugs to Congress by Sept. 5. It is expected to call for a major
boost in federal spending and emphasize both tougher penalties for
individual drug use and mandatory treatment for addicts.
   Bennett was asked on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' if his approach
marks a reversal from the Reagan administration policy, which cut
funds for treatment and emphasized drug interdiction and arrests of
kingpins.
   The $21 billion spent fighting drugs during the Reagan
administration ``wasn't wasted, and it wasn't all wrong. ... ''
said Bennett. ``There were some real successes during the Reagan
era.
   ``I don't think anyone can deny that drugs are pervasive
throughout much of America,'' said Bennett, but recent statistics
indicate that casual drug use is down.
   ``Although some people like to criticize the educational efforts
and the first lady's efforts, they obviously have had some
effect,'' said Bennett, who as Reagan's education secretary
published a booklet on how to keep drugs out of schools.
   ``We are shifting strategy, but let's remember we have not had
the opportunity before to have a comprehensive look,'' said Bennett.
   ``The government may not have been as effective ... (or) as
smart as it should have been. ... But it's the people who are
taking drugs that are causing these tragedies, not the
government,'' he said.
   Asked if he would recommend raising taxes for the drug fight,
Bennett replied, ``Don't think we need taxes.''
   But he insisted, ``The money will be there. We will put our
cards on the table. We will suggest what we want to do and we will
propose spending more money. Then we will see what the Congress
wants to do.
   ``It means making some difficult choices,'' he said.
   Bennett, citing reports of bootleg sales of methadone by addicts
to buy crack, said drug treatment programs need ``much more
accountability.''
   Without it, Bennett warned, ``at some point the American people
will say, `The heck with it.'
   ``The more I've seen of (treatment), the more impressed I am by
the need for efforts in prevention. It's terrible to get into this
business, it's very hard to get out of it,'' he said.
   He scoffed at the notion that research can find a way to end
people's cravings for drugs.
   ``We're not going to uncover anything in a laboratory that ...
we can put in a pill and give it to somebody and they're not going
to want drugs anymore,'' said the onetime philosophy professor.
   And despite five months of ``conscientious'' study of the
issues, Bennett said he has found ``no magic bullet.''
   His recommendations won't be like ``Batman (coming) through the
transom saying, `Here it is, and it's over,''' Bennett said.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Broadcaster Killed, 38 Others Reported Slain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Sinhalese radicals assassinated a
prominent broadcaster in his home near the capital Sunday during
ethnic violence that also killed 38 other people across the
country, officials said.
   Kulasiri Amaratunga, the 62-year-old chief news editor of state
television, was shot in the neck, according to military officials.
   Before escaping on bicycles, the assassins cut telephone lines
at the house in Mount Lavinia, a seaside resort six miles south of
Colombo, the officials said.
   They blamed the killing on the People's Liberation Front, a
Sinhalese group accused of killing two other broadcast
personalities last month as part of a campaign against the
Sinhalese-dominated government. All three victims were members of
the majority Sinhalese ethnic group.
   The militants believe the government and supporters they have
targeted are too soft on minority Tamil rebels, who are fighting
for an independent homeland.
   Military officials also blamed the front for eight killings in
central Sri Lanka. They said the victims were fatally shot Saturday
in Laggala village, about 65 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The bodies were hanged from trees and cement posts in the
village, the officials said.
   They said the victims were identified as five local politicians,
two government officials and a school principal.
   Officials said ethnic violence since Saturday also claimed 30
other lives across Sri Lanka.
   Police officials said 14 villagers of Embilipitiya, 80 miles
southeast of Colombo, were shot and killed by unidentified
attackers.
   Military officials said Sinhalese gunmen shot and killed two
Buddhist monks and one of their students Saturday night in their
temple at Yakkala village, about 20 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Sri Lankan troops shot and killed six civilians who did not stop
at government checkpoints in different places across the country,
officials said.
   Sinhalese radicals fired at a police patrol in the Galle area,
70 miles south of Colombo, killing an inspector and injuring two
constables on Saturday, officials also said.
   In addition, four unidentified bodies were found in central and
southern Sri Lanka since Saturday, officials said.
   They also said two Tamil rebels were shot to death by Indian
peacekeeping troops in the northeastern Trincomalee district.
   During the six-year Tamil insurgency, about 15,000 people have
died in Sri Lanka's ethnic violence. About 11,000 died in the Tamil
insurrection, and the remaining died in the Sinhalese backlash.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population.
   India became involved in this nation's ethnic problems because
of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.

   Depression can hamper a woman's mothering
abilities by hindering her relationship with her infant, according
to a study aimed at keeping such infants from developing their own
problems.
   Researchers found depressed mothers to be less attentive to
their children and less emotionally engaged with them than
non-depressed mothers, said study co-author Donna Gelfand.
   One depressed mother even failed to notice that her baby had
fallen off her own lap, said Gelfand, head of the psychology
department at the University of Utah.
   She spoke in an interview before presenting her work Sunday at
the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association. The
study was done with Douglas Teti of the University of Maryland's
Baltimore County campus.
   The depressed mothers did not have simply occasional periods of
low spirits that everyone feels. Instead, they had long-lasting
depression that had persisted for an average of a year when they
entered the study.
   Previous studies have found that infants of such chronically
depressed mothers are at risk for problems such as excessive crying
and other poor control over emotional behavior, Gelfand said. In
later childhood, they may have trouble getting along with peers and
teachers and lag in school achievement, she said.
   It is not clear whether such problems stem from the mother's
depression earlier in the child's life, or her depression at the
time the problems manifested themselves, or a combination of both,
she said.
   The study included 37 depressed mothers and 37 non-depressed
mothers. The two groups were matched for socioeconomic and marital
status, and age of the child. The infants were three months to 12
months old at the beginning of the study, which has gone on about a
year so far.
   Mothers were studied in their homes by observers who had not
been told which women were depressed, a precaution to avoid biasing
their appraisals. The mothers were observed while they fed their
babies, played with them and filled out a questionnaire.
   In all three situations, depressed women tended to be less
sensitive to their infants' needs than the non-depressed mothers,
and they failed to pick up cues from their children as well as the
other mothers did, Gelfand said.
   They were also less emotionally engaged with their children and
less attentive, she said.
   Depressed mothers were also more likely to perceive their
children more negatively than the non-depressed mothers viewed
their own children. For example, they rated their children as less
intellectually capable and less rewarding, Gelfand said.
   In addition, ``they see themselves as inadequate mothers'' in
such tasks as feeding, bathing, dressing and teaching, Gelfand said.
   ``The depressed mothers just view parenthood as extremely
demanding, almost more demanding than they can bear,'' she said.
   Researchers have started to look at the children as they reach
ages 1 and older, and found the offspring of depressed mothers to
be less responsive to the mother, less interested in her and less
emotionally attached. They also seemed to be generally less happy,
Gelfand said.
   Researchers are testing a program to prevent infants' problems
that can result from a mother's depression. The program includes
weekly visits by a nurse to stimulate the mother's interest in her
baby. Later, to counter a tendency to become housebound, depressed
mothers are encouraged to become active outside the home.
   Too few women have completed the program yet to provide a good
estimate of its effectiveness, Gelfand said.
   Lynn Rehm, professor of psychology at the University of Houston,
said the study's findings on the effects of a mother's depression
generally agree with previous research.

<HEAD>Bonn to Close Refugee-Swamped Embassy in Budapest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany will close its embassy in
Budapest on Monday because the staff's ability to assist hundreds
of East German refugees seeking exit visas to the West is ``totally
exhausted.''
   Refugees have been holed up nearly two weeks at the Budapest
embassy, as well as in West Germany's missions in East Berlin and
Prague.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Claus Wunderlich, who made the
announcement Sunday, refused to say how many East Germans were at
the Budapest embassy.
   News reports last week estimated 300 were in the embassy and
said more were arriving each day. Many traveled to Budapest and
were caught trying to escape to Austria after Budapest removed
barriers along its Western border.
   ``The reception capacity for East German asylum seekers at the
representation in Budapest is totally exhausted,'' the ministry
said in a statement delivered to news agencies. ``The embassy must
therefore be closed for the time being, beginning Monday, Aug. 14.''
   The embassy will be closed to the public, and the refugees
already there will be asked to leave and informed again that only
East Germany can grant them exit visas, officials at the ministry
said.
   Bonn closed its East Berlin mission on Tuesday after 131 East
Germans sought refuge there, and officials have said it will not be
reopened until normal diplomatic operations can be resumed.
   Eberhard Grashoff, spokesman for the mission, said 10 of the
East Germans voluntarily left the facility Sunday but that the
others were still camped on the protected mission grounds.
   The West German mission in Prague, where about 20 East Germans
are thought to have taken refuge, will remain open for the time
being.
   East Berlin's Communist leadership has said it will not punish
those who sought refuge in West Germany, and Bonn authorities have
told the East Germans they need permission from their government to
leave for the West.
   The refugee situation in Budapest developed this summer after
Hungary dismantled the barriers on its border with Austria. At
least 1,500 East Germans are estimated to have escaped to the West
through Hungary since May.
   Most of those at the West German Embassy in Budapest are East
Germans who were allowed to travel to Hungary, then attempted to
escape to Austria and were caught by Hungarian border guards.
   The Hungarians have in some cases noted the failed escape
attempt in the passports of the East Germans. Out of fear that they
would be punished back home, the East Germans have sought West
Germany's protection.
   East Germans can obtain permission to travel to neighboring
Hungary, a Warsaw Pact ally, with relative ease, but applicants for
emigration visas often must wait years for an answer.
   A Hamburg-based newspaper, The World on Sunday, said the West
German intelligence service has determined that 1.5 million East
Germans want to emigrate to the West, or nearly 10 percent of the
16 million population.
   West Germany expects about 100,000 East Germans to make their
way to West Germany by the end of the year, through legal
emigration and escapes.
   The recent increase in escape attempts is believed to be
grounded in an increasing sense of hopelessness among East Germans.
   Neighboring Hungary and Poland have followed the Soviet Union's
lead and adopted market-oriented economic reforms and broadened
personal freedoms. But East German leader Erich Honecker has shown
no inclination to do so.
   In a commentary on the eve of Sunday's 28th anniversary of the
Berlin Wall's construction, the Communist Party newspaper Neues
Deutschland accused the West of trying to ``economically plunder
and destabilize East Germany.''

<TEXT>
   China's decision to force students who planned to
start graduate school to work first appears an effort to combat
youthful idealism with exposure to the real-life complexities of
China's political, social and economic problems.
   The announcement Saturday was reminiscent of the Cultural
Revolution of the 1966-76, when virtually all Chinese college
students were sent to work on farms to learn working-class
attitudes.
   The new order, issued by the State Education Commission and
announced in the China Daily, said only that the goal of the
program was to ``increase the percentage of graduate students with
practical work experience.'' It said the order was aimed at
``especially those in the social sciences.''
   The social sciences are perceived as the most dangerous field of
study because they expose students to alternate political and
economic theories.
   Some fields, like sociology, were banned altogether for many
years under Communist rule.
   The government order that students work for one or two years
first did not say what kind of jobs they would be given or exactly
how many would be affected.
   It said students with prior work experience _ about half of the
originally planned incoming graduate class of 35,000 _ would be
exempt.
   Last week, education authorities denied Western reports that all
college graduates assigned to government jobs will be required to
spend a year working ``at the grassroots'' in small cities or rural
areas.
   A spokesman for the State Education Commission, contacted by
telephone, said a 6-year-old order had indeed required students
assigned to jobs in provincial government and higher levels to do
so. However, he said few students were actually sent to such
assignments.
   The government already has cut the number of incoming college
freshmen nationwide by 30,000 to 610,000 students in an apparent
effort to curb student unrest.
   Many college students who graduated in June already have begun
their government-assigned jobs, including those assigned to
provincial governments or the central government.
   China's education system has a history of combining study with
assigned work for the purpose of political indoctrination. Even
after the Cultural Revolution, middle school and college students
have often been required to spend several weeks each summer in
social service.

   Searchers on Sunday found the

disappeared. All 16 people aboard were believed dead.
   The plane crashed near the town of Gambela about 100 miles

officials said. Leland, D-Texas, was on tour in his capacity as
chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   James Haley, chief spokesman for the embassy in Addis Ababa,
said 12 bodies were initially found at the site 300 miles southwest
of the capital. An earlier report said 13 bodies had been found.
Haley said all others aboard were believed dead.
   Haley said the wreckage was found in terrain so rugged that
medical teams had to be lowered initially from helicopters. He said
helicopters were able to set down no closer than a half mile away.
   In Washington, the Pentagon said in a statement that U.S. Air
Force searchers confirmed there were no survivors at the site.
   Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer said the plane had
``basically disintegrated.'' He said the condition of the wreckage
had made the body count difficult.
   He quoted reports from the scene that said the plane, which lay
in a ravine, had burned after the crash.
   ``It was pretty awesome, unsurvivable,'' said the pilot of a
U.S. Air Force C-130 plane that flew over the site, a steep slope
4,300 feet up a 5,500-foot mountain. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Searchers had no immediate report of what caused the crash.
Officials did not explicitly say when the aircraft went down, but
it was believed to have crashed Aug. 7 on the same day it left the
capital for the refugee camp.
   President Bush expressed sadness over the deaths. ``Mickey
Leland and the other members of his traveling party, both Americans
and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the
hungry,'' he said in a statement from the White House.
   Leland's party consisted of eight other Americans, including two
Leland staff members; one aide to Rep. Ronald V. Dellums,
D-California; a friend of the congressman; three officers of the
U.S. Agency for International Development; and the wife of one of
the AID officials. The other seven aboard were all Ethiopian: a
U.S. Embassy employee, three government officials and a crew of
three.
   The chartered Twin Otter plane disappeared en route to the
Fugnido refugee camp near the Sudanese border, one of four in
southwestern Ethiopia run by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. Fugnido is home to more than 300,000 Sudanese who have
fled famine and civil war in their own country.
   Gambela and the village of Dembidola just to the north had been
an early focus of the search because there are two dirt airstrips
in the area.
   Officials believe the pilot of the twin-engine plane might have
diverted to one of those strips because of heavy clouds and low
visibility at Leland's destination.
   The Ethiopian government said peasants heard a light plane
circling near dirt strips about 90 miles southeast of Gambela on
Aug. 7.
   In Houston, friends and colleagues of Leland streamed into his
downtown office as news spread that the wreckage had been
discovered.
   Rep. Mike Andrews, also a Houston Democrat, said with a breaking
voice, ``This is a very difficult time for Houston. We have lost
one of our most important leaders, and I've lost a very good
friend.''
   Leland arrived in Ethiopia early on Aug. 7 and boarded the Twin
Otter with his party several hours later. Bad weather delayed
takeoff for two hours, and officials said conditions were marginal
for flying when they finally set off from Addis Ababa's Bole
Airport.
   By the time it was learned that they had not reached their
destination, it was getting dark. Bad weather made it impossible to
mount a search until Tuesday.
   The wreckage was first sighted by the crew of a U.S. MH-60
Blackhawk helicopter carrying Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., one of
two colleagues of Leland who came to Ethiopia to take part in the
search, officials said.
   Haley said other American and Ethiopian helicopters and at least
one Soviet chopper were sent to the scene.
   He said the helicopter crews and medical evacuation personnel
would spend the night in Gambela, a town about 50 miles from the
Sudanese border, and recovery of the bodies would begin Monday.
   The search effort grew steadily through the week. More than 10
U.S. Air Force planes, including a high-altitude U-2 reconnaisance
craft, were eventually committed to the effort.
   The Ethiopian air force and Civil Aviation Authority added an
equal number of aircraft, despite cool relations that have existed
between the United States and the Marxist government of this East
African nation since 1974.
   Robert Houdek, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Addis Ababa, said
Ethiopia's help in the search was bound to help improve relations.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 10 grafs to UPDATE with protests in East Germany
and Budapest. Pick up 7th pvs, ``The August...''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germans vandalized the Berlin Wall, an
official called for its removal, and an East German tried to escape
to the West on Sunday, the 28th anniversary of the day construction
began on the infamous barrier.
   Security forces also dispersed about 50 East Germans who tried
to demonstrate in East Berlin in front of the West German mission,
which was closed last week after a crowd of East Germans arrived
seeking refuge.
   Witnesses said the demonstrators tried to lay flowers at the
mission gates in an apparent act of solidarity with their
countrymen holed up inside demanding exit visas to the West. No
protesters were arrested.
   Dorothee Wilms, the West German minister for inter-German
affairs, criticized East Germany's effort ``to build up and perfect
the inhumane barriers'' between East and West. Her deputy chief,
Ottfried Hennig, predicted the wall would be taken down by the end
of the century.
   An unidentified assailant hurled a firebomb at the wall near the
Brandenburg Gate early Sunday, West German police said. The bomb
exploded when it crashed against the wall, but it burned out
without causing serious damage.
   The East German state news agency, ADN, said several masked
assailants from West Berlin damaged border barriers in the southern
sector of East Berlin.
   ADN, which did not describe the damage, said a diplomatic
protest would be lodged with West Berlin authorities.
   Witnesses at the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing between East
and West Berlin reported Sunday that at least one man attempted to
flee across the heavily guarded crossing just before noon. He was
arrested by East German border guards before reaching Western
territory, the witnesses said.
   In Budapest, Hungary, 200 people gathered at downtown
Voeroesmarty Square to protest the wall. The speakers, who included
young East German tourists, called for its demolition.
   Several displayed placards with slogans proclaiming, ``Make
Love, Not Wall,'' and ``We Have No Need of Any Control.'' No
violence was reported during the 40-minute demonstration.
   The August 13th Society, a human rights organization that
monitors East European refugee affairs, estimates that at least
40,000 East Germans have escaped across the borders with West
Germany since the wall was erected.
   Prior to 1961, hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled to the
West, draining the Communist state of many of its top scientists,
artists and intellectuals. The number of escapes surged over the
last few months after Hungary began dismantling its border barriers
with Austria.
   East Germans can usually obtain permission to travel to Hungary,
a neighboring Communist ally, and an estimated 1,500 of them have
illegally crossed from there into Austria this summer.
   Several hundred East Germans have recently sought refuge at West
German embassies, which has prompted Bonn to close its embassy in
Budapest and its mission in East Berlin.
   East Germany on Saturday defended the Berlin Wall and said hopes
for its removal are ``illusory.'' Neues Deutschland, the newspaper
of the East German Communist Party, said the wall is ``a step
toward peace'' and that it will remain in place to prevent East
Germans from fleeing to the West.

<HEAD>New Junta Announces Economic Reform Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's new military leaders on Sunday
announced an economic reform program that includes a 20 percent cut
in government spending and possible decreases in government
subsidies of consumer goods.
   Col. Salah Din Mohamed Karrar, a member of the 15-member council
in charge of the economy, said in an interview with the Sudan News
Agency that he was optimistic Sudan would be able to reach a loan
agreement with the International Monetary Fund soon.
   Improving Sudan's faltering economy, which is burdened by a $13
billion foreign debt and an exhausting civil war in the south, has
been one of the main targets of the new regime, which took power in
a military coup June 30.
   Karrar said the Finance Ministry had ordered government units to
cut spending by 20 percent, but he did not specify how much money
that would save.
   One of the junta's first acts was to cut the Cabinet from 30 to
22 ministers.
   Karrar also said that government subsidies to some of the main
consumer goods would be ``reconsidered,'' but he did not say which
commodities would be affected.
   The ousted elected government of Sadek el-Mahdi had budgeted
$183 million for subsidies this fiscal year.
   Karrar said he was optimistic Sudan would reach agreement with
the IMF next month without affecting the welfare of Sudanese
people. He gave no details.
   In February 1986, the IMF declared Sudan ineligible for further
loans for defaulting on debt payments. U.S. economic assistance was
halted in January because the Khartoum government was late in
paying off loans.

<HEAD>Investigators Wonder If Crack Smoke Killed 10 Infants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical examiners in Philadelphia are trying
to determine whether 10 infants died over the last three years as a
result of inhaling secondhand crack smoke from adults. The 10 all
had chemical evidence of cocaine in their blood.
   The coroner, Haresh G. Mirchandani, came up with the theory
after the April 6 death of a 10-month-old girl named Tasha. Testing
showed there was cocaine in the her blood, some of which had gotten
there the night before her death.
   Mirchandani said the baby died after apparently inhaling smoke
from crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine, generated by her
mother and other adults in the house.
   The deaths of Tasha and nine other babies might show, according
to the medical examiner's theory, that children are highly
susceptible to serious illness and death from breathing in crack
smoke when the drug is smoked by adults around them.
   Mirchandani stressed last week that more research was needed
before his theory could be proven.
   Mirchandani's study involved the cases of six girls and four
boys _ ranging in age from 28 days to 10 months _ who died in the
city in the last three years.
   Each infant had either cocaine or its chemical residue in their
blood, tissue, or organs, the study found.
   Several babies had parents, siblings, or baby sitters who used
crack. Several slept in small, poorly ventilated rooms in crowded
row houses. In some instances, police or residents said they saw
lingering clouds of crack smoke or discarded crack vials in the
homes, according to the investigation.
   Mirchandani said the investigation started the day after Tasha's
death. He refused to provide the full names or addresses of the
infants or their relatives.
   An autopsy performed on Tasha's body revealed small amounts of
active cocaine as well as the drug's residue. Mirchandani
determined that the presence of the active cocaine, which is
usually broken down by the body in two hours, showed the baby had
been exposed to it shortly before she died _ ``only a few hours
before death,'' Mirchandani said.
   The residue indicated exposure to the drug of a long-term
nature, he said.
   Mirchandani visited the baby's 22-year-old mother May 1.
   ``She admitted being a crack addict,'' he said. She ``said she
used cocaine before and during the pregnancy.''
   Mirchandani said the mother was not breast-feeding the child.
She had not put the drug in the child's food or milk, and there was
no sign the child could have found the drug lying around and eaten
it.
   Recent studies of the dangers of the passive inhalation of
cigarette smoke led Mirchandani to the possibility that the same
was true of the passive inhalation of crack smoke. He said even
though the mother ``said she didn't smoke around the baby,'' the
child's room was not well-ventilated and other adults addicted to
the drug smoked it in the house.
   Similar cases in Philadelphia and New York City supported the
doctor's theory, he said.
   ``Cocaine can be toxic at any dose, and is proven to be
dangerous and deadly in even small doses ... even in adults,'' he
said. ``I would expect a much heightened toxicity for infants. It's
common sense. Something that is toxic for adults ... would be even
more toxic for an infant.''

<HEAD>At Least a Month's More Work in Murder Investigation, Task Force
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Green River Task Force is a month or more
away from completing a study of thousands of documents, videotapes
and other possessions of a former law student called a suspect in
the killings of 40 young women.
   ``There's more of it here than even I thought there was,'' Capt.
Bob Evans, commander of the King County Police task force, said of
the material seized from William Jay Stevens II, 38.
   Asked if police had found anything to connect Stevens with any
of the Green River victims, Evans replied, ``Not yet.''
   Stevens denies he is the killer. ``People should know the fact
that I have never hurt anyone in my life,'' he said in a statement
released earlier through his attorney.
   Stevens has not been charged with any violent crimes, including
the Green River killings, a series of slayings from 1982 to 1984,
mostly of prostitutes in Seattle and Portland, Ore. The case takes
its name from the stream south of Seattle river where the bodies of
the first victims were found.
   Police have blamed the deaths of 40 young women and the
disappearance of eight others on the serial killer.
   Stevens is in the King County Jail, serving a one-year sentence
for a 1979 burglary and additional time for escape.
   He's due to be released Sept. 25, but Evans said he doubts the
12-member task force will be finished by then with analyzing the
thousands of items in 55 boxes and bags taken in a July 12 search
of the home of Stevens' parents and a rental house Stevens used as
a student in Spokane.
   Police would have no hold on Stevens after Sept. 25, Evans said.
   ``We're still going through the paperwork and expect to be doing
that for another month or so,'' Evans said.
   ``There's been nothing so far to diminish our interest or to
indicate we should feel any more strongly about him.''
   Stevens walked away from a work-release program in Seattle in
1981, and wasn't apprehended until January of this year, when it
was learned he was living at his parents' home in Spokane and
attending Gonzaga University Law School.
   Among the possessions seized by the task force were police
badges and paraphernalia.
   Investigators have suspected the Green River killer could be a
police officer or someone posing as one.
   
   In an affidavit filed to support a search warrant in the case,
some people who knew Stevens said he liked pornography, frequented
prostitutes and carried photographs of mutilated women.
   Among items seized in the search were 1,800 videotapes. A sample
of the videotapes show they ``ranged from TV shows to hard-core
pornography,'' Evans said.
   He said he will have the task force look at all the tapes ``only
if I have to. I don't want to, but if necessary, I will do that.''
   Besides the tapes, the material includes massive amounts of
paperwork, much of it receipts and personal documents. Evans said
detectives have followed up much of their reading with interviews,
but he had no estimate of the number conducted.
   Evans said investigators are seeking both possible links to the
killings and alibis for Stevens.
   ``We're working very, very hard to prove that he's someone not
of interest to us,'' he said.
   Detectives are looking at people other than Stevens, but Evans
declined to say whom.
   ``There always have been other people we have been checking out
and there will be until there are no leads to follow.''

<HEAD>Virginia Firm Took Fees From HUD Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Virginia consulting firm collected huge fees
through a Department of Housing and Urban Development program,
including $1.5 million for one project, according to a published
report.
   And that project was approved by a senior official in March on
his last workday at the agency after he waived numerous HUD
regulations, The Sun reported Sunday.
   The consulting fees appear to be the largest yet uncovered in
programs operated by the troubled federal housing agency, which has
been rocked by disclosures of favoritism and irregularities in many
programs.
   The Sun reported that Land Development Financing, led by Curtis
J. Mimna and his associate, Terry T. Mooney, stood to gain up to
$4.9 million in consulting fees on projects under the Title X land
development program until HUD Secretary Jack F. Kemp announced that
he was halting the program in late June.
   Under Title X, a developer acquires land, builds roads and
installs utilities on parcels of land that are then sold to
builders who construct houses and apartments. If a project fails _
and about half of all Title X projects have, according to HUD
officials _ HUD pays the mortgage lender the balance due on the
loan.
   Kemp said he would end the program because it was costly to
taxpayers and had not helped provide adequate housing for the poor.
   The largest Title X loan ever approved by HUD, for $78.2
million, was granted March 3 to McNair Farms, a proposed
development in Fairfax County, Va. Mimna's LDF received a $1.5
million consulting fee for obtaining the HUD-backed mortgage, the
newspaper reported.
   The loan was approved by James C. Nistler, deputy assistant
secretary of HUD for single-family housing, on his last day at the
agency. HUD documents indicate that Nistler intervened personally
in the processing of the application, issuing a series of
directives to expedite the project and waive regular HUD procedures.
   Mimna's brother, Michael, said his brother left the Washington
area several months ago and that he did not know how to reach him.
   The documents reveal numerous apparent deviations from normal
HUD procedures in the handling of McNair Farms.
   _Normally, independent cost figures computed by HUD staff are
used to determine how much a mortgage should be. But in the case of
McNair Farms, the developer's own cost figures were used.
   _The mortgage amount approved was $2 million more than the costs.
   _A full environmental impact statement was not done, despite
environmental concerns about wetlands and flood plains on the
property.
   _Some of the mortgage proceeds were permitted to be used to pay
off debts on land that was not covered by the Title X loan.
   _Detailed working drawings and specifications, normally required
before approval, were not submitted.
   According to the documents, the project was approved after
numerous meetings involving Nistler, Mimna and Tricia Canzeri,
whose husband, Joe, was briefly a special assistant to President
Reagan. Canzeri also was a top adviser to Vice President Dan
Quayle's campaign, and organized an inaugural gala for President
Bush.
   James L. Clouser, executive vice president of Merrill Lynch MSB,
a New York-based lending affiliate of the national brokerage firm
that provided the mortgage on McNair, said Mimna told him several
months ago that he had made Mrs. Canzeri a partner in his
consulting firm while seeking approval of the McNair project.

   Showers and thunderstorms drenched sections of Kansas and much
of the Eastern Seaboard on Sunday, and rain fell on much of the
rest of the nation. Low-temperature records were tied in three
Southern cities.
   Downpours in southwest Kansas overnight dumped more than 4
inches of rain at Coldwater and Offerle. Light rain continued into
the afternoon.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms hit much of the Atlantic
Coast, with the heaviest rain over Florida and southern New
England. Up to 3 inches of rain soaked Massachusetts in the 24
hours ending at midafternoon Sunday.
   Thunderstorms also extended from northern Oklahoma to
west-central Texas, and over the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Fort Myers, Fla., tied its record low for the date at 70
degrees; Meridian, Miss., tied its 62-degree record and New Orleans
tied its 68-degree mark.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Lompoc, Calif., to 107 in Needles and Palm Springs,
Calif. Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 30 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   Monday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Gulf Coast states to the Great Lakes region and northern
Atlantic Coast states; and scattered showers and thunderstorms from
Montana to Utah and Colorado.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast,
in the 70s from the upper Mississippi Valley to northern New
England, in the lower 90s across southern Texas and southern New
Mexico and west of the Rockies and above 100 degrees in the desert
Southwest.

<HEAD>Darman: Tax Raise May Be Considered</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will consider raising
taxes next year unless Congress agrees to cut Medicare and other
domestic programs, budget chief Richard G. Darman said Sunday.
   The Office of Management and Budget director said he will
recommend that Bush seek fiscal 1991 cuts in the growth of
Medicare, agriculture, veterans and other entitlement programs, but
not Social Security.
   Darman, on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' repeated Bush's resolve not
to raise taxes, but said:
   ``When the Congress comes back in September, if they don't fully
implement the bipartisan budget agreement, we will have to have a
sequester, and it will drive us toward having to face the tax issue
the following year, which we shouldn't do.''
   He said the administration and the legislative branch must find
savings of $25 billion to $30 billion to avoid an automatic,
across-the-board cut under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit
reduction law.
   He complained that Medicare payments for doctors' fees have
risen ``at about 15 percent a year. That can't go on forever; it's
going to consume the whole budget. So we have to restrain the
growth there.''
   ``There are going to be some wealthy doctors, presumably, who
aren't quite so wealthy in the future,'' he predicted.
   ``I think it will be necessary to recommend additional
structural reforms in the entitlement programs _ not Social
Security, but in the other entitlement programs,'' said Darman. He
singled out Medicare, ``agricultural programs, veterans programs,
and other such entitlement programs.''
   Darman said he did not regard the military budget as ripe for
cuts. He said it has fallen in real terms by 12 percent over the
last five budgets.
   He defended the half-billion-dollar B-2 Stealth bomber, which he
acknowledged is ``a big, pricey item.''
   Nothing is more important than avoiding nuclear war, he said,
``so if it's an effective deterrent, it's well worth the
investment,'' Darman said.
   Darman recently decried Americans' tendency to spend now and
saddle later generations with the bills.
   ``I am sure there is more than enough blame to go around,
although I would not like to have any attached to the present
administration or the prior administration with which I was
associated,'' said the former Reagan aide.
   He also defended Bush's call for a manned mission to Mars in the
next century that will cost more than $400 billion in today's
dollars over the next three decades.
   ``It's a rather long time, we don't have to spend it all
tomorrow,'' said the budget chief.
   ``The key is that we start the planning so that we don't miss
this opportunity to expand human horizons,'' he said. If ``we
penny-pinch everywhere at the risk of sacrificing some of the most
exciting possibilities for humans in the future, that's not being
responsible either.''

<HEAD>Workers Repairing Storm-Ravaged LA Aqueduct Get Break From Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLANCHA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers repairing the flood-damaged
aqueduct that supplies millions of Southern Californians with water
got a break in the weather Sunday, but expected to be on the job
two more weeks.
   Some 30 workers using bulldozers and other heavy equipment
labored under sunny skies to scoop tons of mud, rocks and other
storm debris out of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in Inyo County about
180 miles north of Los Angeles.
   ``They're continuing right along today, making good progress,''
said Los Angeles Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Dorothy
Jensen.
   A two-mile stretch of the aqueduct was buried when a flash flood
hurled tons of debris down upon it Tuesday. Then a storm Thursday
buckled a 1,000-foot stretch of the aqueduct's concrete lining.
   The aqueduct carries water from streams in the eastern Sierra
Nevada range to Los Angeles and other Southern California
communities.
   Two 30-person teams were each working 12-hour shifts, and
repairs were expected to take two weeks, the spokeswoman said.
   The city, which gets 75 percent of its water from the aqueduct,
wasn't expected to experience shortages in the meantime, but water
officials urged residents to voluntarily conserve.
   A series of intense, widely scattered storms deluged parts of
San Diego, Imperial, San Bernardino, Riverside, Mono and Inyo
counties throughout most of last week before moving into Nevada.
   Until the aqueduct is fixed, the water department will provide
Los Angeles with water by drawing supplies from reservoirs south of
the broken part of the aqueduct and making extra purchases from the
Southern California Metropolitan Water District.
   Ms. Jensen said the damage was the worst since similar storms
ravaged the aqueduct in 1968.

<TEXT>
   Soviet youth poured into Moscow to hear American
heavy metal heroes Sunday but 10,000 security men and rockers with
``Just Say Nyet'' buttons kept the concert from getting too
intoxicating.
   ``If the police weren't here, there would be drugs and drinking
and making love,'' said Anna Rvinskaya, an 18-year-old Moscow
mother dressed in the metal bracelets and tight, short blue-jean
skirt favored by her motorcycle gang.
   ``But what can you do with police everywhere?'' she shrugged.
   And they were everywhere, among the 100,000 people gathered for
the second day of ear-shattering heavy metal sounds from the likes
of Bon Jovi, Scorpions and Ozzy Osbourne. It was Moscow's biggest
festival of foreign rock music, which for years was condemned as an
infectious item of Western decadence.
   Moscow militia in blue, riot police in black, KGB agents in dark
civilian clothes and young toughs in uniform track suits and
T-shirts lined the stage and aisles throughout the packed Lenin
Stadium in Moscow's Luzhniki District.
   Soviet impresario Stas Namin said he and the foreign organizers
of the concert had requested the overwhelming security. He said
Soviet authorities have never allowed so many young people to
gather in one place, and they didn't know what to expect.
   Authorities might be suffer extra anxiety since the crowd came
dressed in chains and skin-tight leather.
   Motley Crue incited the crowd to scream obscenities in English,
which Soviet government television broadcast nationwide in its
coverage of ``fragments'' of the concert. And some fans shed their
clothes for a brief streak across the stands.
   But mountains of vodka bottles piled up outside the stadium, and
suggestions of more outrageous behavior remained onstage.
   It was an appropriate action for a concert billed as an
anti-drug and anti-alcohol event. Many rockers wore buttons
emblazoned, ``Just Say Nyet.''
   The audience poured into Moscow from all over the Soviet Union.
Oleg Galkin of Astrakhan said he hitchhiked for 48 hours to reach
the festival, and he doesn't even like heavy metal.
   ``I would rather have heard Led Zeppelin, Dire Straits or Pink
Floyd,'' he said.
   Hundreds of youths who could not afford the scalpers' price of
up to $112 a ticket milled around outside the stadium. But no
matter _ the music could be heard a half-mile away.
   Motorcycle gangs, rarely seen on the streets of Moscow, showed
off tattoos, brass knuckles and flags of the American Confederacy.
   They were joined by frumpy grandmothers and officials in
business suits sitting stiffly in a stadium full of singing,
screaming and dancing fans.
   Other rockers in the two-day festival, broadcast in the United
States on pay television Sunday, were Cinderella and Skid Row from
the West and Nuance and Brigada S from the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Teen Survival Program Faces Licensing, Legal Challenges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A wilderness survival program for troubled
teens is fighting for its own life after running afoul of state
officials and a teen-age girl who claims she was kidnapped and
abused by the program's operators.
   Challenger Foundation II is designed to quell rebellious
behavior and build confidence in teen-agers by forcing them to
confront their problems in the setting of the rugged southern Utah
desert.
   During their first three days in the desert, for example, they
may eat only wild plants that they pick or animals and insects that
they catch.
   The state attorney general's office says such a program amounts
to therapy, which Challenger II lacks a license to provide.
   In addition, a judge has ruled that Challenger operators
violated the civil rights of 17-year-old Elizabeth Zasso of Mt.
Kisco, N.Y., by abducting her from a dentist's office and forcing
her into the program at her father's request.
   Ms. Zasso is suing the program and its operators for $230
million, and a big award could put the school out of business.
   Challenger is threatened with further legal action from the
state attorney general unless the operators can demonstrate that
participating teens are provided adequate food, water and clothing,
as well as such necessities as toilet paper and sleeping bags.
   Program founder Stephen Cartisano, a former Air Force special
forces sergeant billed in ads as a ``real-life Rambo,'' has filed a
countersuit charging the state with harassment.
   Several state officials say they will decide this week whether
Challenger must obtain a license as a therapeutic care provider to
continue operation. Currently, the program's counselors don't have
the training required for such a license.
   Cartisano, who was in southern Utah over the weekend, did not
return telephone calls to his office in Provo.
   Ms. Zasso's attorneys didn't respond to a telephone request for
comment.
   The company's ads promise that for $12,500 per teen, Challenger
``stops self-destructive behavior and places parents back in
control.'' Its detractors say the 63-day survival program is cruel
and dangerous.
   In the first stage of the program, the teens drink stream water
they must purify with chemicals and substitute sagebrush for toilet
paper.
   During the two latter stages, the participants' diet included
oatmeal, lentils, cheese, meat, raisins and other foods provided by
Challenger.
   During stage three, each 12-member group is given two wooden
handcarts which they pull across about 130 miles of desert,
emulating Mormon handcart pioneers who settled Utah in the 19th
century.
   A graduate of the program, Krista Palmer, 15, of Provo said it
helps youths overcome social and behavioral problems by building
confidence and self esteem.
   ``It wasn't my idea of a picnic. It was a hard program,'' said
Ms. Palmer. ``It helped me realize my potential, to see what I
could do physically, emotionally and spiritually.''
   She said that before her mother ordered her into the program
last May, she was shy and lacked confidence. Now, she said she
feels confident talking with strangers and peers, and she's
confident that she can boost her grades beyond her current
C-average.
   She also believes she is better able to resist the temptation of
drug abuse.
   Before the experience, ``My self-esteem was low enough I didn't
think I was worth enough to say no. I was headed for the drugs and
alcohol.''
   In her lawsuit, Ms. Zasso said she was working as a dental
assistant in Mt. Kisco on June 15 when Challenger employees lured
her into a dark hallway, subdued her and hustled her to a nearby
airport for a flight to southern Utah.
   Ms. Zasso had left home to live with her boyfriend's family and
had refused to return home.
   She said she was subjected to a strip search and then forced to
walk as much as 18 miles at a time without food and clean water.
The suit also alleges that she was denied medical treatment for a
concussion.
   She remained in the program for 42 days until 3rd District Judge
Dennis Frederick, who is considering the suit, found her rights had
been violated and ordered her release.
   Zasso praised the program in a videotaped interview conducted by
Challenger employees in the desert, but she later testified that
she feared she would be forced repeat the program if she didn't
tell the counselors what they wanted to hear.

<HEAD>GOP, Democrats Square Off in Race for Wright Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Republican physician was the highest vote-getter
in a special election to replace Jim Wright in Congress, but the
Democrat who will face him in a runoff predicted victory in the
heavily Democratic 12th District.
   Dr. Bob Lanier garnered 21,978 ballots, or 39 percent of the
vote, in Saturday's special election, but Democrat Pete Geren was
elated about his 32 percent showing _ 17,751 votes _ in the
district that encompasses most of Fort Worth.
   Geren received a ringing endorsement from Wright, who had
expressed no favorite in the primary.
   ``I want to ask all of you to redouble your efforts because
here's a man I want to be my successor,'' the popular Wright told
supporters at a Fort Worth party for Geren. ``He is steeped in the
traditions of our state and country.''
   Democrat Jim Lane finished third in the race with 22 percent of
the vote, the only other candidate to garner more than 3 percent.
   ``Well, the Democrats won tonight,'' Geren, an attorney, told
cheering supporters late Saturday. ``It took us four candidates to
do it, but when you total it up, we got nearly 60 percent of the
vote. I call that a victory.''
   Wright resigned the seat June 30 after an ethics investigation
uncovered 69 instances of alleged house violations.
   In other election results, a Dallas government redistricting
plan that supporters said would foster minority representation
passed by a 2-to-1 margin. And Dallas Area Rapid Transit officials
won a significant battle when voters in four of five Dallas suburbs
decided to retain the agency.
   Because no one in the eight-candidate race to replace Wright
received a majority of the votes, a runoff is necessary. Gov. Bill
Clements will set a date after election results are certified.
   Lanier, host of a nationally syndicated TV health show, ``60
Second Housecall,'' pointed to his success in a district
traditionally dominated by Democrats, and Wright in particular.
   Wright first won election in 1955 and was re-elected 17 times in
the next 34 years, often with token or no opposition. He received
88 write-in votes in Saturday's special election.
   However, Ronald Reagan and George Bush carried the district in
the last three presidential elections.
   ``Remember, now it's halftime,'' Lanier told supporters Saturday
night. ``Take a breather, go to church, come back on Monday and
let's get after it.''
   In an emotionally charged referendum, Dallas voters
overwhelmingly approved a proposal to reorganize the city council,
ostensibly to equalize voting power between whites and minorities.
The proposal received 41,456 votes to 20,823 against.
   However, an analysis by The Dallas Morning News of voting
patterns in Saturday's election showed that more than 85 percent of
those who voted in the city's predominantly minority districts
opposed the plan. The plan passed citywide because of overwhelming
support from white voters.
   The so-called ``10-4-1'' plan calls for the addition of two
single districts and four quadrant representatives, leaving the
mayor as the only at-large member of the city council.
   Opponents, who had their own plan, argued that adding seats
would dilute minority strength.
   A lawsuit challenging the current 8-3 plan is scheduled to be
heard Sept. 5 by U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer, who also is
reviewing the 10-4-1 plan.
   The five suburban elections were crucial to about one-fifth of
the Dallas transit agency's sales tax income, and to the fate of a
regional transportation system.
   Voters in Carrollton, Rowlett, Irving and Plano decided by
margins of 59 percent or more to stay in DART. Coppell rejected
DART by a 20-vote margin, but officials there said a recount is
likely.
   In June, DART approved a $2.45 billion plan to crisscross the
metropolitan area with 66 miles of light rail by 2010. The plan
also called for 18 miles of rail connecting downtown to the
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and 37 miles of bus and car
pool lanes for suburban commuters.

<HEAD>Israel, SLA Captured Assistant to Hezbollah Car Bomber</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli security forces and South Lebanese Army
militiamen captured a Lebanese man who allegedly assisted a suicide
car bomb attack that wounded five Israeli soldiers, the army said
Sunday.
   The 28-year-old man, identified as a mercenary of the Moslem
fundamentalist Hezbollah group, was captured in south Lebanon on
Wednesday, the day of the car bombing attack, but the army withheld
the information until Sunday, an army statement said.
   The army would not give his name, and a military spokesman would
not say if the man was being held by Israeli or SLA security forces.
   Five Israeli soldiers were wounded, one critically, when a car
packed with 550 pounds of explosives blew up near a convoy of
Israeli and SLA troops.
   The Shiite Moslem group Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the
bombing and released a videotape showing the driver, Sheikh Assad
Biro, who killed himself in the attack.
   There was no immediate word from Hezbollah on the arrest.
   The army statement said the purported assistant was a resident
of the village of Markaba, about a mile from the Israeli border. It
said he was recruited by Hezbollah in Beirut to organize attacks in
Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon.
   The alleged assistant let Biro stay the night before the bombing
at his home in the security zone, the statement said. It said the
two tried unsuccessfully to plant an explosive device that day.
   The man helped Biro get to the area where the car bomb detonated
but was not in the car at the time, the army said.
   The security zone is a six- by 10-mile-wide strip in southern
Lebanon where Israel maintained a military force after the
withdrawal of most of its troops from Lebanon in 1985.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is a fundamentalist Iranian-backed
Shiite faction in Lebanon that is considered to be the umbrella
organization for extremist groups holding foreign hostages in
Lebanon. Sixteen foreigners are being held, including eight
Americans.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Victory Day Holiday Again Provokes Outcry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `Japan surrendered...,' to CORRECT date to May
sted March.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Japanese-Americans are trying to
change the name of Rhode Island's Victory Day holiday because they
say the popular name _ ``V-J Day'' for ``Victory in Japan'' _ is
racist.
   The holiday Monday is still celebrated only in Rhode Island,
where by tradition it creates a long weekend when virtually
everything shuts down and people head to the beach.
   This year, the Japan Society of Rhode Island has hired lawyers
to try to change the name.
   ``Unfortunately, the name Victory Day has caused persistent use
of the appellation `V-J Day' by the public, by the press,
businesses, state offices,'' said one of the lawyers, Jennifer Wood.
   Wood declined to say how the group might pursue a lawsuit, but
said she has asked Attorney General James E. O'Neil's office to
press for a name change or a way to force people to use the
holiday's official name.
   Thomas Connell, spokesman for O'Neil, said the attorney general
cannot ``require the citizens of the state to call the holiday by a
particular name.''
   ``It's not the holiday itself that's bothering me. It's the
name,'' said Hiromi Mineo Lima, 44, a Rhode Island resident for 16
years. ``I feel a bit of discrimination against the Japanese race.''
   Rhode Island veterans' groups are adamant that the name should
remain unchanged.
   ``Leave that ... holiday alone,'' said Lionel Poissant, state
service officer for the Rhode Island Veterans of Foreign Wars.
``It's too bad they didn't think of that when they attacked us.''
   Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945. Germany's surrender, the old
``V-E Day'' for ``Victory in Europe,'' came May 7, 1945.
   Attorney Wood said the holiday's nickname ``discriminates on the
basis of race against Japanese-Americans'' and ``impugns the
character of Japanese-Americans in the United States, many of whose
families have been here for generations, or many of whom fought in
World War II.''
   Mindful of the popularity of the long weekend, politicians have
never seriously discussed repealing the holiday, established in
1948.
   There have been attempts in the General Assembly to change its
name to ``Peace Day'' or ``Remembrance Day,'' but all have been
sunk by the powerful veterans' lobby.
   The legislature did pass a resolution in 1987 reaffirming the
``Victory Day'' name after concerns were raised that the holiday
would make it more difficult for Rhode Island to attract Japanese
business.
   ``They started the war. We won the war,'' said Rene Bobola,
president of the Central Falls Veterans Council. ``We insulted
them? They insulted us by attacking.''

   President Bush said Sunday that Rep. Mickey
Leland was ``engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the hungry''
when his plane crashed on its way to a refugee camp in Ethiopia.
   The president, who ordered U.S. military aircraft into the
search for Leland last week, was among the first to express
condolences when an Air Force helicopter carrying one of Leland's
friends and congressional colleagues found the charred wreckage in
a mountain ravine.
   Bush, at Camp David, Md., for the weekend was notified by
telephone by his national security adviser soon after the downed
plane was found.
   Flags were quickly lowered to half staff at the White House and
elsewhere in official Washington and national leaders expressed
sorrow at the loss of the Texas Democratic congressman and other
members of the traveling party.
   Leland, chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger,
vanished Monday after taking off from Addis Ababa for a refugee
camp on the Sudanese border. It was his second trip to the Horn of
Africa since March to promote relief efforts for hundreds of
thousands of Sudanese who face starvation.
   ``I have known, admired and worked with Mickey Leland for many
years,'' Bush said. ``His sense of compassion and desire to help
those in need has aided millions of people from Houston to Addis
Ababa.''
   House Speaker Tom Foley said the House had lost one of its most
dedicated, committed and energetic members.
   Foley has authorized Majority Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa.,
and Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif, chairman of the Congressional
Black Caucus, to travel to Addis Ababa and accompany the bodies of
Leland and U.S. staff back to the United States.
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel has designated Reps. Bill
Emerson, ranking Republican on the hunger committee, and Jack
Fields, R-Texas, to accompany the group.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Leland
``a respected public servant who was dedicated to the people of
Texas and to all Americans.''
   Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., is already in Ethiopia and was on
the helicopter that found the wreckage. Rep. Alan Wheat, D-Mo.,
also went to the African country earlier to aid the search.
   ``In his search to look at into the plight of the world's most
desperate and hungry individuals, Rep. Leland represented the best
in compassion that we as a nation possess,'' Foley said. ``His was
a mission which, as we all know all too well now, was fraught with
potential danger.''
   Gray said Leland's loss ``is the world's loss'' and ``deprives
us all of a man whose compassion, commitment and leadership in the
war against hunger saved the lives of tens of thousands of the
world's children. Those of us who are his colleagues and friends
can best keep his spirit alive by renewing our commitment to the
cause for which he gave his life: eradicating hunger both here and
around the world.'
   Leland's wife, six-weeks pregnant with their second child,
remained in seclusion at her home in Houston.
   Members of the congressman's Washington staff, which had
conducted numerous press briefings during the search, received
congressional colleagues and friends privately in Leland's Rayburn
House Office Building suite of offices on Sunday.
   Among those visiting was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who had prayed
with Leland's staff and friends during the weeklong vigil. He told
reporters the Houston Democrat had worked tirelessly to ``prick the
conscience of Congress'' about the starving in Africa.
   ``I have watched him stand in these halls and literally break
down crying, trying to appeal to other congresspeople to be
sensitive to the fact that people in Ethiopia ... were clutching to
his ankles and dying before his eyes, with worms and flies
devouring their bodies.
   ``And with that sense of passion and moral imperative he kept
going back again and again and again,'' Jackson said.
   Dellums said the those aboard the aircraft _ including a staff
member, Joyce Francine Williams _ ``gave their lives nobly, in an
effort to advocate on behalf of people much less fortunate than
themselves.
   ``And I believe that the nation and the world have lost a
considerable number of very caring and compassionate and concerned
human beings,'' said Dellums.
   Describing him as someone ``who wore his feelings and compassion
right out in the open, in a very vulnerable and caring and
wonderful way,'' Dellums said he would miss Leland ``beyond
comprehension.''
   Other House and Senate members, the State Department and civil
rights leaders were among those expressing their grief.
   ``There is a special Jewish word that describes Mickey Leland,
`mensch' _ it means `a real human being.' The Anti-Defamation
League has been privileged to know and work with him,'' said league
national director Abraham H. Foxman.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said Leland died as he lived: ``On
a mission of mercy and hope for victims of poverty, injustice,
racism and hunger. Where ever suffering people existed on our
planet, Mickey Leland wanted to be there to help.''
   The State Department called Leland an outstanding statesman and
humanitarian and praised his relentless efforts on behalf of the
hungry.
   Mark L. Edelman, administrator of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which had four employees aboard the
plane, said the traveling party represented the best in America's
tradition of reaching out to those in need.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said: ``Mickey Leland was a strong
representative, a champion of the helpless and he was my good
friend. Mrs. Bentsen and I jin his family and many friends around
the world in mourning his death.''
   Texas' other senator, Republican Phil Gramm, said his heart went
out to Leland's family ``in this tragic time. He will be missed.''
   Hosea Williams, a veteran civil rights leader and Atlanta city
councilman, called Leland ``truly a human rights warrior.''
   ``I don't know that I've met a congressman in Washington that
was more sensitive or committed,'' Williams said. ``Not only Texas
but the country has lost one of its most relevant black leaders.''
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, said Leland brought ``a real sense of
urgency on poverty'' to his work in Congress.
   ``Mickey was sensitive to the issue of hunger and it bothered
him deeply that in Africa, the homeland, hunger was ravaging the
population,'' Lowery said.
   In Houston, friends and colleagues streamed into Leland's
downtown office as news spread that the wreckage had been
discovered.
   Rep. Mike Andrews, a Houston Democrat, said with a breaking
voice, ``This is a very difficult time for Houston. We have lost
one of our most important leaders, and I've lost a very good
friend.''

   Soviet authorities, dealing with a strike in
Estonia, face new work stoppages in the republics of Azerbaijan and
Georgia over nationalist issues, union leaders said Sunday.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said Sunday that as many as
40,000 Russian-speaking workers in Estonia were striking to protest
what they feel are discriminatory laws recently passed on
preserving the Estonian language and limiting the voting rights of
immigrants. Pravda sided with their demands.
   The People's Front of Azerbaijan called a general strike Monday
in ``non-strategic industries'' to demand local Communist Party
officials move to a more democratic structure, said activist Aidin
Amirbekov in a telephone interview.
   In Georgia, pro-independence activists had called for a general
strike to begin Tuesday. There were conflicting reports on whether
it would proceed.
   The ethnic Russian strikers in Estonia won support from a key
source Sunday. Under the headline, ``And what about civil rights?''
Pravda charged that the new Estonian election law, which sets tough
residency requirements, violates the Soviet constitutional equal
rights provision.
   ``As is known, the Constitution has not yet been abandoned,''
Pravda said.
   The article criticized the Estonian lawmakers, who have led the
call for human rights guarantees, for restricting the voting rights
of non-Estonians.
   The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the
same district for two years or anywhere in Estonia for five years.
Candidates must live in the same place for five years, or in
Estonia for 10 years.
   A new language law requires most workers to learn Estonian. Many
Russian workers have not, even after decades of living in Estonia,
and natives complain that many police and ambulance personnel
cannot understand their language.
   A Moscow activist said workers in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku
demonstrated for a second night Sunday, but Amirbekov, speaking
from the town, denied that report.
   Amirbekov said workers at manufacturing plants are being asked
to strike Monday to support demands that local leaders ``find
political solutions instead of military ones'' to the republic's
ethnic violence, which has caused dozens of deaths. He said workers
in strategic industries, such as Baku's extensive oil complex, were
asked to stay on the job.
   Some activists in Baku are demanding removal of Soviet troops
from the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and an end to
curfews in the republic, but Amirbekov said authorities believe
relations are too tense to consider that step.
   Azerbaijan, which traditionally is Shiite Moslem, has been
embroiled in a dispute with neighboring Armenia, whose population
is mainly Christian, over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its population is
predominantly Armenian, and Armenia wants to annex it.
   In Estonia, work has at least partially halted at 26 enterprises
in the capital of Tallinn and at 13 factories in Kohtla-Jarve, the
labor newspaper Trud said Sunday. Train workers were on strike and
the state airline Aeroflot carried only emergency supplies and
passengers, Trud said.
   The Russians, most of who work in heavy industrial plants, also
object to a new national decision to give Estonia and the two other
Baltic republics, free rein over its economy. In asserting their
rights, ethnic Estonians have angered immigrant workers from Russia
and elsewhere.
   The workers are demanding that factories with a mainly
Russian-speaking labor force remain the property of the national
government rather than be handed over to Estonia.
   Artur Kapityem at the Russians' strike headquarters in Tallinn
said by telephone that leaders were in Moscow to meet with Kremlin
leaders since they have refused to negotiate with Estonian
officials.
   ``We no longer trust the republic's leadership,'' Tass quoted M.
Lysenko of the strike committee as saying.
   Kapityem denied Pravda's report that criminal charges had been
filed against labor leaders under an emergency Estonian decree
banning the strike.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population. Russians make up about a third of the 1.6 million
people.

   The oldest space shuttle
glided to a perfect landing in the Mojave Desert on Sunday,
completing a secret mission to deploy a spy satellite and
reportedly conduct ``Star Wars'' experiments.
   ``A super team and a great machine _ welcome home, Columbia,''
Frank Culbertson, an astronaut from Mission Control in Houston,
said as the five-man crew landed shortly after sunrise, ending a
five-day, one hour and 56-minute journey of more than 2 million
miles.
   Columbia, though dirty, sustained little damage to the tiles
that protect it from the heat of the fiery re-entry, and no tiles
appeared to be missing, said Ed Jenner, shuttle support manager for
the Air Force at Edwards.
   It was the first mission in 3{ years for Columbia, which
inaugurated shuttle flights in 1981. Columbia's last flight ended
10 days before the January 1986 Challenger disaster that killed its
crew of seven.
   ``It was an apparently perfect landing,'' observed Nancy Lovato,
a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``Welcome home, space cowboy!'' friends and relatives yelled at
pilot Richard Richards shortly before he and the other astronauts
departed aboard two Gulfstream jets bound for Johnson Space Center
in Houston.
   Richards told a crowd of about 100 spectators that Columbia's
mission represented ``a reaffirmation that human beings belong in
space. We can do wonderful things there. We can excite our kids and
make our planet a better place to live.''
   The astronauts and their wives arrived in Houston around 4 p.m.
CDT. They were greeted by their families and about 300 cheering
friends and co-workers.
   ``It was a real privilege to participate in the restoration of
Columbia to flight status,'' the shuttle's commander, Air Force
Col. Brewster Shaw, told the crowd at Ellington Field. ``It was a
privilege to accomplish what we accomplished on this flight for the
United States of America.''
   ``It wasn't nice; it was fantastic,'' added Richards, a Navy
commander and one of three space rookies on the flight.
   After a 15-minute ceremony, the astronauts shook hands and
hugged many of the well-wishers before climbing into vans and
heading home with their families.
   The landing ended the 30th mission of the shuttle program.
Columbia, for a years a ``hangar queen'' that was stripped of parts
to keep other shuttles flying, had undergone more than 250
modifications called for after the Challenger disaster.
   The other crew members were Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, Army Lt.
Col. James Adamson and Air Force Col. Mark Brown.
   The shuttle's sonic booms startled slumbering Los Angeles as it
hurtled across California. Minutes later, Shaw guided the 97-ton
orbiter to a 6:37 a.m. PDT landing on a hard clay runway, the
aircraft trailing a plume of dust.
   A news blackout was imposed on the mission by the Air Force. But
Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said Wednesday that a satellite was
deployed by the astronauts during their first day in orbit on
Tuesday.
   Rice maintained the official silence about the satellite's
purpose, but it is widely believed to be a 10-ton spy satellite
designed to take detailed photographs of military targets over a
wide area of the globe, including most of the Soviet Union. It
would help the United States verify Soviet compliance with arms
agreements.
   The shuttle crew also reportedly monitored military sites on
Earth and was believed to have conducted experiments related to the
``Star Wars'' missile defense program.
   The shuttle landed in perfect weather, with unrestricted
visibility. The few people gathered to watch on Rogers Dry Lake
also were treated to a view of the Perseid meteor shower, which
sprinkled the sky with shooting stars.
   The Air Force base 80 miles north of Los Angeles has been host
to as many as half a million people for shuttle landings but was
closed to the public Sunday because of the Pentagon's demand for
secrecy.
   The news media were allowed to watch and record the landing from
about two miles.
   The Department of Defense said secrecy was needed to ``limit an
adversary's ability to determine the mission of a given DOD shuttle
flight.''

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Leader Released, Says He Is Under House Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fundamentalist Moslem preacher charged
with anti-government activities has been released from jail, but he
said Sunday he was under virtual house arrest.
   Omar Abdel-Rahman, who is blind, was acquitted twice of charges
connected to the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in October
1981. He and 48 other defendants now are being tried on charges of
illegal possession of weapons, attempting to kill a police officer
and assault.
   The charges are punishable by death.
   On Thursday, a state security court trying the 49 ordered the
release of 25 prisoners, including Abdel-Rahman. It ordered one
defendant, who is charged with bombing a theater in the southern
town of Fayoum, to remain in detention. The 23 others accused in
the case had not been jailed.
   Abdel-Rahman, contacted by telephone at his home in Fayoum,
said, ``I'm in good health.'' He has high blood pressure and
diabetes.
   ``There are security forces around my house,'' he said. ``They
have stopped me from going out to pray at the mosque. They are not
letting me out at all and are arresting my visitors.''
   Maj. Gen. Wagih Issa of the Interior Ministry denied
Abdel-Rahman's claims and said, ``He is free to move. Whoever wants
to visit him may do so freely.''
   The ministry, which is in charge of internal security,
reportedly had invoked emergency regulations to extend the
detention of the 25 who were released under the court order.
   Abdel-Rahman returned to his home Friday night.
   The emergency law has been in force since Sadat's assassination.
It gives police broad powers of search and arrest without charge
and bans unauthorized demonstrations and strikes.
   Abdel-Rahman, a former theology professor at Assiut University
south of Fayoum, heads a fundamentalist Moslem group that demands
the immediate and full full implementation of the Islamic law, or
Sharia.
   The government claims 90 percent of the existing law conforms to
Sharia.
   Abdel-Rahman was accused of inspiring the gunmen who killed
Sadat and was acquitted. He also was found innocent in a later
trial of 300 Moslem fundamentalists charged with an attempted coup
after Sadat's assassination.
   In both cases, the prosecution said Abdel-Rahman was the
spiritual leader of an underground group called Jihad that was
dedicated to the overthrow of the government. He was released in
1985 following the second acquittal.
   The current charges against him and 48 others involve an
anti-government demonstration on April 7 that the prosecution
claims Abdel-Rahman led.
   Police rounded up about 2,500 Moslem fundamentalists for
questioning after the demonstration.

<HEAD>Spokesman Says PLO Agrees To Elections If They End Israeli Occupation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization said Sunday the PLO is ready for elections in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip if it is guaranteed the balloting will end
Israeli occupation of the territories.
   ``I hereby announce that the PLO is ready for elections tomorrow
if it is guaranteed freedom and democracy,'' said Bassam Abu
Sharif, a spokesman for PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, told the
British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``We are ready if the world community will guarantee that the
elections we go to will be one step in a process that will lead to
an end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza,'' he
said in the interview in Tunisia, where Fatah, the main group in
the PLO, held its congress last week.
   The congress called for intensified military action to end the
Israeli occupation of the territories and rejected Israeli Premier
Yitzhak Shamir's plan for elections.
   ``What we are after is freedom, like any other people,'' Sharif
said. ``We are asking the Israelis to come and sit down and talk to
us.''
   But he said that as long as Israel occupies the territories the
PLO will continue to lead the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. More than 530 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have been killed
in the uprising that began in December 1987.
   Shamir has proposed elections in the occupied lands and talks
with the elected Palestinian representatives on an interim
self-rule solution for the 1.7 million Arabs in the territories.
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli government official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he saw nothing new in Abu Sharif's
statement.
   He said the PLO's repeated demand for guaranteeing creation of a
Palestinian state before any negotiations amounts to rejection of
Israel's call for talks without conditions.

<TEXT>
   A senior aide to U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh owned Rite Aid Corp. stock when he participated in the
1986 appointment of an executive of the drugstore chain to the
state pharmacy board, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday.
   The aide, Murray G. Dickman, also was a guest of Rite Aid
chairman Alex Grass and his two sons, both company executives, on a
January 1983 trip by corporate jet from Harrisburg to New Orleans
to watch Penn State play in the Sugar Bowl, according to the
newspaper.
   At the time, Dickman was secretary of administration under
then-Gov. Thornburgh. Dickman is now assistant to the attorney
general.
   Rite Aid, the nation's largest retail pharmacy chain, and its
president, Martin L. Grass, have been indicted in Cleveland on
state bribery charges.
   Grass, who is accused of delivering a $33,000 bribe and other
benefits to a member of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy, is to be
arraigned Tuesday.
   Dickman said he was infuriated by implications in the Inquirer's
story about his time in state government.
   ``I did nothing improper according to the laws,'' Dickman said
in an interview Saturday night with The Associated Press. ``I am
truly offended.''
   Dickman owned 400 of 40 million shares in Rite Aid, U.S. Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel said. Based on the stock's 1986
price range on the New York Stock Exchange, his interest was worth
between $9,700 and $14,200.
   ``That's not a very big stake in the company,'' Runkel said.
Runkel, who also served in Thornburgh's gubernatorial
administration, added that under Pennsylvania law, Dickman did
nothing improper.
   As secretary of administration, Dickman was the key aide on
appointments to state boards. He approved a recommendation that
Thornburgh name Rite Aid executive Frederick H. Wendte to a seat on
the Board of Pharmacy, the Inquirer said. The governor went along
with the recommendation on June 4, 1986.
   Dickman said Saturday that he was aware of the appointment, but
to insinuate that he had an effect on the decision was
``preposterous.''
   He said he sold the stock in 1986, most likely toward the end of
the year.
   Dickman left Thornburgh's cabinet on Nov. 15, 1986 to accept a
$100,000-a-year job as a senior vice president of the
Harrisburg-based company. Thornburgh's second term as governor
ended in January 1987.
   Thornburgh accepted a seat on the Rite Aid board of directors in
April 1987 and served until he became attorney general in August
1988. Dickman left his Rite Aid job in November 1987 and joined
Thornburgh in the Justice Department last August.
   He was not required to list the Rite Aid stock on disclosures
filed publicly with the state Ethics Commission and did not do so.
He disclosed it within Thornburgh's administration on the more
detailed reports required by the governor code of conduct.
   Dickman called the 1983 Sugar Bowl trip ``a social call'' from
his friend Roger Grass, then a Rite Aid vice president.
   The trip was not disclosed although Thornburgh's code of conduct
barred officials from accepting gifts or entertainment.
   Dickman said he cleared the trip with the governor's Office of
General Counsel.
   ``It doesn't appear that the legal advice was sound,'' Runkel
quoted Thornburgh as having said Friday.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people marched
through Roman Catholic neighborhoods of West Belfast on Sunday and
cheered for the violent campaign of the Irish Republican Army.
   ``I want to praise the real freedom fighters in this country ...
I want to praise the men and women of the Irish Republican Army,''
Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, told thousands
of cheering supporters who stood in a pouring rain.
   The province's new chief police constable, Hugh Annesley, showed
up at the march and Adams pointed him out to the crowd, joking that
he was the man wearing five flak jackets.
   ``Welcome to west Belfast!'' Adams roared.
   The march of the republican forces _ those who seek a united
Ireland _ was a much more overtly political march than a big
Protestant parade in Londonderry Saturday that commemorated the
300th anniversary of a defeat of the Catholic King James II.
   Some marchers in Belfast carried placards with the names of
those killed on the their side in 20 years of ``the troubles,'' and
fife and drum bands chanted ``I.R.A.''
   Though much of the republican emphasis last week was on the
anniversary of the British government's long-discarded policy of
imprisoning terrorist suspects without trial, Sunday's speeches
focused on Monday's 20th anniversary of British troops in the
province.
   The army was sent into Londonderry on Aug. 14, 1969, following
fierce battles between police and Roman Catholics.
   ``The British army came in 1969 not because we were being
attacked, but because for the first time since the beginning of
this state _ this misbegotton tuppence ha'penny bastardized state _
we were fighting back,'' said Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a fiery
leader in the Catholic civil rights marches of the 1960s.
   ``The reasons they are still here 20 years after is because we
are still fighting back,'' she said.
   In a speech in which she compared the throngs of reporters and
photographers to ``some kind of diseased butterflies that seem to
thrive on other peoples' problems,'' she said little had been
gained in 20 years.
   The principle of ``one man, one vote'' had been secured, but
real political power had been taken away, she said.
   Catholics were twice as likely as Protestants to be unemployed
20 years ago, but now she said they are 2{ times more likely to be
without work.
   ``Everything we got out of them we squeezed out of them,'' Mrs.
McAliskey said. ``Yet it was nothing, because every time we gained
something they clawed it back. ... Have we come 20 years for
nothing? No. Something has changed, and I'll tell you what has
changed ... We have changed.''
   The thousands who marched up the Falls Road to Andersontown on
Sunday represent only a minority within Northern Ireland's Roman
Catholic community. In election after election, Sinn Fein has
pulled about half as many votes as the Social Democratic and Labor
Party, which is committed to peaceful change.
   The Social Democrats have taken no part in the marches this
weekend.
   Security was strict along the parade route, and march organizers
complained that the crowd was constrained too closely by armored
Land Rovers.
   There were no incidents during or after the parade, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, a British police force.
   A dozen people were arrested early Sunday in Londonderry after
20 gasoline bombs were thrown at officers, the constabulary said.
No one was injured.
   More than 2,700 people have died in 20 years of violence in
Northern Ireland, which is divided between Catholics who generally
favor a united Ireland and Protestants who support continued
British rule.
   Two-thirds of the dead were civilians.

<HEAD>Arson Blamed in Fatal Rooming House Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arson caused a fire blamed for the deaths of
three people in a rooming house that had no fire escape and a
substandard sprinkler system, investigators said Sunday.
   About 10 people representing local, state and federal
investigative agencies, most of whom had previously said they
suspected arson, met for two hours to discuss Tuesday's fire at the
Ben Crest Plaza rooming house.
   The group reached ``a final conclusion that it was arson
involving the use of an accelerant,'' said Howard Whitehead,
assistant district attorney for Essex County. An accelerant is a
substance such as gasoline used to accelerate a fire. He said it
would take a week or more before the accelerant was identified.
   After the fire struck, tenants clad only in their night clothes
had to leap from windows to escape the flames. Some swung down on
ropes the management had provided as fire escapes. More than 19
tenants and rescuers were hurt.
   Before the fire, the city had filed a criminal complaint against
the building's owner, Leo Allard, for failing to install a
sprinkler system covering each room as required by a 2-year-old
ordinance.
   Whitehead said authorities had no suspects or possible motive in
mind. ``There are two angles to this, motive and opportunity, who
was around at the time,'' he said.
   Whitehead declined to provide further details, such as where the
fire might have begun, saying he didn't want to influence anyone
who would be questioned. Some 50 or 60 people, including the
rooming house tenants, were interviewed already.
   Authorities were still hunting for two rooming house residents
seen around the time of the fire who haven't been seen since
although they are assumed to have escaped safely, he said.
   Whitehead said a search dog trained to locate human remains
failed to find any trace of the missing men inside the burned-out
building.
   In the meantime, the rooming house, actually two joined
buildings _ one five stories, the other four stories _ was being
torn down, floor by floor.
   The demolition could yield more clues, Whitehead said.
   Attending Sunday's meeting were representatives of the state
fire marshal; the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms;
state police; Lynn fire and police officials; Whitehead, and Lynn
Mayor Albert DiVirgilio.

   A 16-year-old Palestinian died Sunday of wounds
suffered in a clash with soldiers, and troops dispersed bands of
masked youths attacking Gaza Strip workers applying for entry
permits to Israel.
   Arab hospital officials said 11 Palestinians were shot and
wounded Sunday in clashes with Israeli soldiers in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The death raised to 536 the number of Arabs killed in the
20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories.
Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain in the violence.
   Also Sunday, one of Israel's leading religious figures said that
under Jewish law, the concept of preserving Jewish lives took
precedence over all other commandments, including settling the
biblical land of Israel.
   But Rabbi Ovadia Yosef of the ultraorthodox Shas political party
did not make the anticipated religious ruling on returning
territories to preserve Jewish lives.
   He said relinquishing territories at this time is not realistic
because there is no Arab partner for peace.
   Jewish settlers living in the occupied West Bank claim there is
a religious imperative for them to settle there.
   Yosef, addressing an assembly of about 1,000 ultraorthodox Jews
in Jerusalem, did not retract his statement made to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak last month that Israel could return
territories to avoid loss of lives in a war.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking at the same assembly,
said he favored territorial compromise so Israel could maintain a
Jewish majority in its own state.
   ``Between claiming our right to the (biblical) land of Israel _
and I don't doubt that right _ and losing the Jewishness of the
state ... I want a Jewish state within its own borders with the
Jewish traditions,'' he said.
   Rabin's left-leaning Labor party favors territorial compromise
while Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc is
opposed.
   The latest Palestinian to die in the uprising was Fayez Jaber
Abu Obeid, 16. The army said he was shot during a clash with troops
Saturday at the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, and he died
at Tel Hashomer Hospital.
   Also in the Gaza Strip, a 32-year-old taxi driver, Mustafa
Darwish Abu Dahrouj, was fatally shot Saturday, and Palestinian
sources said he was killed because it was believed he collaborated
with with Israeli authorities.
   He was the 95th Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs as a
suspected collaborator.
   Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at youths
throwing stones at about 5,000 Palestinian workers applying for
entry permits near the Erez crossing in the Gaza Strip, Arab
witnesses said.
   An army spokesman said troopers dispersed rioters but no one was
injured seriously. He would not say if tear gas and rubber bullets
were used.
   Israel, in an effort to limit the uprising, is requiring all
Palestinians with jobs in Israel to have entry permits.
   Both Israel and leaders of the uprising are trying to control
the workers' movements.
   A military official said the fighting at Erez began after
officials turned away hundreds of people from an application office
because of the large number of workers waiting. The office has been
handling up to 1,000 applicants daily.
   About 50,000 Gazans work in Israel and for many families their
jobs are the only income. The military official said about 40,000
permits have been issued.

<TEXT>
   Five volunteer firefighters and a
sixth person have been arrested and charged with setting 16 fires,
a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The arrests Friday grew out of an investigation by police and
the arson squad of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office into 50
suspicious fires, according to The Record of Hackensack.
   The 16 fires occurred in a railroad boxcar, trash bins, brush
and abandoned mattresses between January 1988 and last June. No one
was injured.
   The prosecutor's office said the fires ``were started by the
five borough firemen and one juvenile female who enjoyed watching
her boyfriend fight the arson blaze.'' There was no other
indication of motive.
   The six were charged in East Rutherford Municipal Court with
failure to report or control dangerous fires, the Record reported.
All but the juvenile, whose name police did not release, were
charged with criminal mischief. Four of the people charged were
released on their own recognizance.
   Kurt Dechert, 21, and Randall Gillies, 20, were also charged
with arson. Dechert was released on $50,000 bail. Gillies was
released on $20,000 bail, the Record said.
   Also charged were Dechert's brother, Peter, 18, James Rivelli,
19, and Sean Reilly, 20.
   The five volunteer firefighters were to be suspended from the
East Rutherford department until the outcome of their cases, Fire
Chief Alfred Klamerus told the Record.

<TEXT>
   For more than a year platoon leader Falk Turba
patrolled the border between East and West Germany, his automatic
rifle at the ready to stop anyone attempting to flee to the West.
   In July, he slipped away from his comrades, tossed his rifle
aside and scrambled over the barbed-wire and concrete barriers to
West Germany.
   ``I just couldn't take it anymore,'' Turba said in an interview
in West Berlin on Sunday, the 28th anniversary of the building of
the Berlin Wall.
   Turba, 20, spoke of the daily life of communist East Germany's
elite border troopers _ young men selected by Communist Party and
military officials because of their loyality to the state.
   Turba, who grew up in Dresden, said border guards were told in
April that a shoot-to-kill order against civilians trying to flee
East Germany had been lifted.
   But he said most of his comrades had quietly ignored the order
during their border service.
   ``Only about 10 percent of the hard-core, gung-ho troops would
shoot at an unarmed civilian attempting to flee,'' Turba said.
``They're the macho types who like strutting around with their
machine guns looking tough.''
   But he said it was a great risk for the border guards to allow
someone to escape.
   ``If you let someone escape, you go to prison,'' he said. ``It's
also very risky because you patrol in pairs, and you never know
what the other guy is thinking or what he would do.
   ``But I hoped, and many others did as well, that I would never
have to arrest someone.''
   He said electronic listening devices and alarm systems, attack
dogs and rows of barbed-wire usually slowed would-be escapees long
enough that border troops could arrest them.
   Many of those caught were given long prison terms.
   According to West German statistics, 191 people have been killed
trying to escape since the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 and the
border between the two Germanies was sealed by barriers.
   But about 218,000 people managed to escape including 2,614
border troops, according to the statistics.
   Turba said he decided to flee because he had little hope of
political and economic changes in his country.
   Unlike Hungary and Poland, where reform communists have
succeeded in expanding freedoms, East German leader Erich Honecker
maintains a hard-line policy.
   Turba said a growing number of border guards are openly
questioning the nation's border policy, which East German officials
contend is necessary ``to protect socialism from Western
plunderers.''
   ``You sit in your freezing bunker or guard tower and begin to
ask yourself what this border is for and what you are doing,''
Turba said. ``You reach a point where you realize its senseless and
brutal.''
   He said morale among border units is slumping because the
increasing number of escape attempts brings additional pressure
from their officers.
   Frustration and disillusionment lead many troopers to break
regulations, according to Turba.
   ``Some people bring books to read in the towers. Others rig
their field radios to tune into Western broadcasts. The political
officer once took off to go hunting,'' he said.
   On July 12, Turba told his comrades he had problems with his
motorcycle and he needed to take it for a test drive. He roared
over a hill, coasted to the border barriers and bounded to freedom.
   ``There are a lot of weak points along the border and we know
them best,'' he said.

   President Bush expressed his ``profound
sadness'' Sunday at the crash in Ethiopia of an airplane that was
carrying Rep. Mickey Leland and 15 other persons.
   Returning to the White House by helicopter from Camp David, Bush
also conveyed his thanks to the government of Ethiopia and the U.S.
military team that found the wreckage.
   ``I want to ... simply express the profound sadness that we feel
at the loss of the lives in Ethiopia,'' said the president.
   He said he had not yet spoken with the Texas congressman's wife,
Alison, ``but I certainly express my profound sadness, profound
regrets over all of this to her, and to their child.''
   His somber mood lifting for a moment, Bush recalled with a smile
that ``in a happier time,'' both Lelands had been his guests at a
recent barbecue for members of Congress on the South Lawn of the
White House.
   ``It's a sadness for everybody. He was an outstanding man, a man
of great humor,'' Bush said of the Democratic congressman from his
hometown of Houston.
   ``Everyone from Texas knew of his lively nature and his
commitment to helping others. So it is with profound sadness that I
convey to his family and to his colleagues and to his staff the
regrets that all Americans feel,'' the president said.
   Bush also thanked ``everybody that involved themselves in this
almost unprecedented search, and certainly the government of
Ethiopia, who could not, I'm told, have been more cooperative.''
   Asked if the Ethiopians had requested assistance to determine
how the crash occurred, Bush replied: ``Not that I know of, but
they certainly will get any cooperation on that from us, just as we
did, have fully cooperated on the search.
   He added, ``It has been unprecedented and the result is terrible
but I must commend the courageous men and women in the armed
services that joined in this search. It was really a very difficult
search, and they did it well, against bad weather, a lot of things.
So it was quite special and showed us pulling together.''
   When a reporter asked if Bush had anything to say about the
cause Leland died for _ fighting world hunger _ the president said
no.
   ``This isn't a time to say anything but how sad and profoundly
sad I feel about the fate of the people on that plane,'' said Bush.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Frederick C.
McClure, Bush's chief liaison to Congress, and a deputy, Nicholas
Calio, would join a congressional delegation that will fly to Addis
Ababa on an official mission to bring back the bodies after they
are identified. It was uncertain when they will depart.
   Earlier, the White House issued a statement from Bush in which
the president said he was ``truly saddened to hear that the
discovery of Mickey Leland's aircraft revealed that apparently
there were no survivors of this tragic accident.''
   ``Mickey Leland and the other members of his traveling party,
both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _
trying to feed the hungry. I have known, admired and worked with
Mickey Leland for many years. His sense of compassion and desire to
help those in need has aided millions of people from Houston to
Addis Ababa,'' it said.

   A 166-foot fish processor sank in
Ketchikan Harbor at the southeastern point of Alaska, leaving
behind an oil slick, the U.S. Coast Guard said Sunday.
   The Ocean Pacific began to list slightly Saturday evening and by
about 9 p.m., all crew members were safely evacuated to another
fishing vessel tied up nearby, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Greg
Robinson.
   Four of the 68 people aboard received minor injuries, were
treated at a local hospital and released.
   The steel-hulled vessel was carrying between 15,000 and 18,000
gallons of fuel, Robinson said.
   It was not immediately known why the ship sank or how much fuel
had escaped. Divers were on the scene Sunday in the 24 fathoms of
water, sealing fuel vents to prevent further seepage of oil,
Robinson said.

<HEAD>Report: Expelled Soviet Diplomat Interested in Radar System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet diplomat expelled two weeks
ago had tried to obtain information about the advanced radar system
on Sweden's new warplane JAS 39 Gripen, a newspaper said Sunday.
   The Stockholm daily Svenska Dagbladet did not identify the
official but said he was posted at the Soviet consulate general in
Goteborg.
   According to the paper, he tried for several years to obtain
information from employees of Ericsson Radar Electronics AB in
nearby Molndal.
   Foreign Ministry sources and news reports said Swedish security
interests did not suffer but would have been at risk had the Soviet
diplomat continued his activities.
   The diplomat was expelled two weeks ago, but the Foreign
Ministry did not announce the expulsion until Friday.
   A ministry spokesman Sunday refused comment on the newspaper
report.
   Last year, two Soviet citizens were expelled from Sweden.
   In October 1988, a Stockholm-based Soviet trade official was
asked to leave Sweden after being accused of industrial espionage.
   That April, a Soviet businessman living in Goteborg was expelled
after trying to obtain information about foreign and Swedish
technology.

   A Continental Airlines 727 was forced to abort its
takeoff in Denver on Sunday when its tail engine disintegrated,
scattering pieces of metal and rotor blades on the runway.
   The pilot of Flight 1249 to Portland, Ore., reported ``a
flameout'' at 1:33 p.m. and was forced to return to the gate, said
Richard Boulware, spokesman at Stapleton International Airport. He
said there were no injuries reported among the 128 passengers and
seven crew members.
   A preliminary look at the Boeing 727's No. 2 engine, which is
mounted in the tail of the plane, showed an apparent failure in the
turbine section, said Continental spokesman Ned Walker in Houston.
   He said an initial examination of the engine showed no external
damage but inside ``apparently some blades in the turbine section
were missing. It appears it was completely contained within the
turbine section.''
   Airport workers ``discovered a substantial number of rotor
blades and scrap metal on the runway,'' Boulware said.
   ``It is very unusual to have an engine do that on a 727. I can't
remember the last time it happened, if it actually ever happened
before,'' said Tom Cole, a spokesman for Boeing in Seattle. He said
the engine was manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   ``Shortly after the captain initiated his takeoff roll, an
indicator came on in the cockpit showing one of the engines was not
at full power,'' said Walker. The pilot followed procedure by
returning to the gate, Walker said.
   ``We were getting ready to taxi off,'' said passenger Steve
Bremmer, 39, of Portland. ``He (the pilot) kept going and going.
The nose lifted up just a bit but it was mushy. The pilot set it
down. He put the engines in full reverse.''
   Walker said the airline believes a portion of the engine
``disintegrated'' but did not explode, since the debris did not
penetrate other portions of the aircraft.
   The pilot told passengers that an engine fan blade broke and
that the pieces were sucked into the engine, causing it to blow
apart, said passenger Carl Miller, 34, of Portland.
   Earlier, Boulware said indications were that the engine had
exploded.
   Walker said 727s, which have all three engines mounted near the
rear of the plane, are designed to take off with just two engines.
   The No. 2 engine has come under scrutiny recently in DC-10
aircraft, which are larger than 727s, but Walker said there is ``no
comparison whatsoever to the DC-10 question.''
   The failure of a No. 2 engine is believed to have been involved
in a crash and two other incidents, including the crash of United
Flight 232 in Sioux City, Iowa, last month.
   In that accident, in which 111 people died, the tail engine
exploded, severing all three of the plane's hydraulic flight
control systems.
   Last week, a Northwest DC-10 made an emergency landing in Denver
after its No. 2 tail engine apparently started disintegrating in
flight, nicking the hydraulic lines but not severing them.
   On Friday, a third DC-10 bound for Denver aborted takeoff in
Boston because of a stalled compressor in the tail-mounted engine,
officials said.
   Cole, the Boeing spokesman, said there are 1,764 727s flying,
and it is the most used plane in the world.
   The passengers of Flight 1249 were put on another flight to
Portland on Sunday afternoon, Walker said. Federal authorities have
been notified of the incident, he said.

   Four heavily armed fugitives in
south-central Brazil on Sunday released their three hostages,
including two television reporters, and made a getaway in a plane
provided by authorities, police said.
   Police said four traded their captives for an aircraft and pilot
to end a three-day standoff with police on a highway near the town
of Presidente Prudente, 635 miles southwest of Rio de Janieiro.
They were armed with hand grenades, submachine guns, pistols and
shotguns.
   Police said the hostages were unharmed.
   ``I lived for four days with a pistol at my head but not for one
minute did I believe I would die,'' said Monica Calassa, one of the
hostages. ``A person who trades her life for that of another can't
die like that.''
   It was not clear where the plane was headed. The fugitives, two
married couples, earlier had indicated they wanted to be flown to
Paraguay.
   Brazilian media identified the fugitives' leader as Rui Ribeiro
de Campos and said he owns a farm in Paraguay.
   ``The plane departed late this afternoon but is flying at a very
low altitude and we are not able to pick them up on the radar,''
policeman Nivaldo de Pirondi said by telephone from Presidente
Prudente.
   The pilot was Aniceto de Oliveira Gomes, a rancher and mayor of
the rural town of Pantalina in central Goias state, Pirondi said.
He voluntered to fly the hostages to a destination of their choice,
Pirondi said.
   Police said a sixth man, apparently a friend of Gomes', had
accompanied the pilot on the flight.
   The plane's departure ended a three-day standoff between more
than 100 police and the fugitives, who had led police on a 500-mile
chase through three states since Wednesday.
   On Wednesday, the fugitives were paid a $42,000 ransom and given
an armored car and driver in exchange for a 9-year-old boy thay had
kidnapped on Aug. 3. Three local newswomen offered to take the
place of the young boy, and the kidnappers later released the one
of the reporters.
   However, Goias state authorities on Wednesday failed to provide
a plane for their escape, and the kidnappers began their flight.
   The kidnappers stopped only for gasoline and food from a
roadside cafeteria. To eat, one kidnapper stepped from the car
holding a pistol to a newswoman's head.
   Several previous attempts to negotiate the hostages' release had
failed.

   A man tried to swim handcuffed across part
of Lake Erie on Sunday in a symbolic fund raiser for China's
beleaguered pro-democracy movement, but had to stop short of his
goal when a support boat sank.
   ``We weren't doing bad; we're just disappointed we didn't
finish,'' said Maynard ``Magilla'' Schaus, who with three Chinese
students was trying to swim 10 miles from Crystal Beach, Ontario,
to the Erie Basin Marina here. They were forced to stop about eight
miles into the 10-mile swim.
   Two swimmers from the Erie, Pa., area had better luck than the
38-year-old Buffalo actor and writer. Bob North, 35, and Harvey
Snell, 38, came ashore in North East, Pa., on Sunday morning after
a 26- to 30-mile swim that began the previous evening at Long
Point, Canada.
   It was the first time anyone had completed a swim across the
lake since 1975.
   The outboard boat that sank during Schaus' shorter swim was one
of two support boats, and carried a styrofoam replica of the
``Goddess of Democracy'' statue that Chinese students erected in
Beijing's Tienanmen Square before the June military crackdown.
   The boat began taking on water about two miles from Buffalo and
sank within two minutes, Schaus said. The swimmers had been in the
water for about seven hours when it was called off at 3:30 p.m.
   A passing boater and the Erie County sheriff's marine patrol
helped the swimmers and the people in the boat that sank, Schaus
said. He said the marine patrol gave him a ticket for having an
unregistered rowboat _ the boat that didn't sink.
   Schaus said he didn't know why the other boat sank, but
speculated that a large wave or a loose drainage plug may have been
the cause.
   Schaus has made the swim twice before for other charities, but
Sunday was the first time he did it handcuffed, which he said was a
metaphor for the loss of freedom in China. To swim, he used a
modified dog paddle.
   Xianglong Zhang, one of the students at the State University of
New York at Buffalo who swam with Schaus, said he was more
disappointed for Schaus than in his own failure to finish the swim.
   ``Without this accident, he would have been successful in
reaching here,'' said Zhang.
   Schaus said he made the effort ``to demonstrate that there are
Americans who care about standing up for freedom, people who
believe in the tenets this country was founded on.''
   The swim was sponsored by the Chinese Students Club at the
university to help victims of the crackdown on the pro-democracy
movement and provide information on the movement.
   The sponsors were unable to say how much money was pledged.

<TEXT>
   The new release ``The Abyss'' appeared to make
a splash at the weekend box office with an estimated $8.6 million
in receipts, putting the film second only to ``Parenthood''
nationwide, an industry source said Sunday.
   The Ron Howard-directed ``Parenthood'' was expected to take in
$9.6 million, and the third-place spot was expected to go to ``A
Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child,'' bringing in some $8.3
million, said the source, who asked not to be identified.
   Complete figures were due Monday.
   ``The Abyss,'' the $43 million underwater adventure by 20th
Century Fox, made a solid opening Wednesday, taking in $2.1 million
at the national box office, Daily Variety reported.
   ``The Abyss'' stars Ed Harris as the foreman of an experimental
underwater oil rig commandeered by a group of Navy SEALS to salvage
a U.S. nuclear submarine. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays the
foreman's estranged wife.
   The film was shot in large part in an unfinished South Carolina
nuclear power plant's cooling tank, filled with 7.5 million gallons
of heated and filtered water.
   The movie underwent 3{ months of principal filming, 40 percent
of it underwater. Its filming required director James Cameron,
actors, camera operators and a squad of technicians to remain
underwater for up to 10 hours a day.

   A meeting that had been planned as a celebration
of hope became a memorial service Sunday when Rep. Mickey Leland's
high school and college classmates heard that the congressman's
plane had crashed in Ethiopia.
   ``Sometimes, they fall for a purpose,'' Howard Johnson of the
Houston Independent School District told about 400 people gathered
in the Phillis Wheatley High School auditorium.
   Many in the audience were classmates of Leland from his days at
Phillis Wheatley and Texas Southern University.
   The airplane carrying Leland and 15 other people disappeared on
Monday en route to a refugee camp, and Sunday's service had been
planned as one of hope for the 44-year-old Texas Democrat's safety.
   But searchers found the wreckage of the plane scattered on a
rugged mountainside. All aboard were believed dead.
   Leland's trip to Ethiopia was typical of the man, said Phillis
Wheatley classmate Madeline Williams. ``He just set out to do
things and didn't care whether or not it endangered his life,'' she
said.
   Leland had been touring Ethiopia in his capacity as chairman of
the House Select Committee on Hunger, and Johnson urged his
audience to continue the congressman's quest to help the hungry.
   ``Mickey would love that,'' Johnson said.

   Students from Virginia waved from a

   Crowds estimated by police at 150,000 watched the cavalcade.
   Leaders of big business have joined festival president Sir
Yehudi Menuhin, the violinist, to launch a $16 million trust fund
to support the festival.
   In the next three weeks, 1,150 shows will be given 9,500
performances by 8,600 participants _ 60 percent professional and 40
percent amateur _ at the official Edinburgh festival and the
unofficial Festival Fringe, which runs in tandem with it. The
festival ends Sept. 3.
   The Georgians, who danced behind a hammer-and-sickle flag at the
traditional parade, are among 87 dancers, musicians and singers
from the Soviet Union performing in and around Edinburgh.
   There are 35 U.S. groups presenting some 100 plays and shows,
with professional and college groups taking over church halls and
clubs.
   ``Is There Life After High School?'' is a song-and-sketch comedy
presented by the E.C. Glass High School of Lynchburg, Va., which

   Firefighters hustled to stamp out dozens of
small fires ignited by lightning Sunday, but held their own against
major forest and range fires that have scorched about 91,000 acres.
   Brief thunderstorms helped keep major fires from growing, but
the lightning that accompanied them sparked nearly 100 new
outbreaks in the Boise and Payette national forests alone,
officials said.
   Firefighters who parachuted into affected areas and firefighting
aircraft put out most of the new fires before they burned more than
an acre, said U.S. Forest Service fire information officer Carol
Tocco.
   In the Boise National Forest in central Idaho, firefighters
moved closer to containing a 45,524-acre fire and a 20,380-acre
blaze.
   The two fires were 90 percent contained by Sunday afternoon, and
officials projected full containment by Monday evening.
   Firefighters were having less success with two fires that have
scorched 13,300 acres in Payette National Forest.
   The fires had combined by Sunday to form one larger fire.
Efforts to contain it were augmented by two Army Blackhawk
helicopters that ferried firefighters to isolated edges of the
blaze.
   More than 6,500 firefighters and 1,400 military personnel have
battled 10 major fires in Idaho during recent weeks.

   Sixteen inmates seized an
Australian missionary and 13 other people as hostages Sunday during
religious services at the city jail, and the inmates demanded talks
with three government officials.
   Police said the convicts grabbed weapons from prison guards,
took the hostages and demanded to meet with House Speaker Ramon
Mitra, Sen. Santanina Rasul and Douglas Caga, governor of Davao del
Sur province.
   It was not known what their demands would be.
   One policeman was wounded when the convicts later opened fire on
a crowd gathered outside the Metropolitan District Command
Detention Center, witnesses said.
   In Manila, an aide to Mitra said Monday the House speaker had
not decided whether to go to Davao City, 600 miles southeast of the
capital.
   The hostages included Jackie Hamil, an Australian lay
missionary, nine women and a 9-year-old boy, police said. It was
not immediately clear who the two other hostages were.
   Police said the hostage-takers were the same convicts who broke
out of the Davao Penal Colony in April and seized several hostages
to protest conditions at the prison.
   They surrendered after being promised they would be transferred
to the Muntinlupa prison in a Manila suburb. But the promise was
never fulfilled.
   The leader of the group was believed to be a former air force
soldier, Mohammed Naser Samporani, 36, who is serving a 27-year
sentence for murder, police said.

   A Norwegian trawler caught an unmarked
submarine in its fishing net but the sub's crew used axes and
blowtorches to cut the vessel free and it fled without identifying
itself, a news report said Sunday.
   The trawler Orion was fishing Saturday near Bear Island, 250
miles off of northern Norway, when the submarine ran into its nets,
dragging the Orion backward, the ship's owner Jens-Petter Kraknes
told the Norwegian news agency NTB.
   It reported Kraknes said he decided not to release the submarine
unless it identified itself and the sub surfaced quickly. The
submarine crewemen refused to identify their craft and instead used
axes, blowtocrhes and sledgehammers to cut away the net, NTB said.
In about an hour the sub was freed and sailed away, Kraknes told
NTB.
   His report said the Orion fishermen saw no markings on the
vessel, which was in international waters, but they took
photographs of the vessel and they will be sent to Norway's
Northern Defense Command.
   Arild Isegg of the Norwegian Defense Ministry told NTB he was
``just about positive'' there were no submarines from the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area, which is used by both
NATO and Soviet vessels.
