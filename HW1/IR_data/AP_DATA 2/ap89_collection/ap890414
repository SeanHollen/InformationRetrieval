   Sandi Patti won or shared five awards
and Amy Grant was voted artist of the year Thursday night at the
20th annual Gospel Music Association awards show.
   Ms. Patti was voted No. 1 female vocalist for the eighth
straight year, but her two-year reign as top artist was broken by
Ms. Grant, whose songs have crossed over to the pop music charts.
   Ms. Patti also won inspirational song of the year for ``In
Heaven's Eyes,'' inspirational album for ``Make His Praise
Glorious,'' choral collection album for ``Sandi Patti Choral
Praise'' and instrumental album for ``A Symphony of Praise.'' The
instrumental award was for the musicianship on the album and not
for her vocals.
   ``In heaven's eyes, there are no losers,'' Ms. Patti said in
accepting her award for top inspirational song.
   Ms. Grant, in accepting the top award at the close of the
3{-hour gala, said singing gospel music has brought her closer to
her associates in the industry. ``In this field, you are with
family,'' she said.
   Ms. Grant also won for contemporary gospel album and short-form
video, both for ``Lead Me On.''
   The new a cappella group Take 6 won four honors to go with the
two Grammy awards it won in February. Take 6 won group of the year,
best new artist, top black gospel album for ``Take 6'' and No. 1
contemporary black gospel song for ``If We Ever.''
   Wayne Watson, who has had 15 straight single songs on the Top 10
of the gospel music charts, was named male vocalist of the year.
Among the other five finalists was Larnelle Harris, who had won the
honor three times previously.
   ``I try to be grateful to the Lord and not get puffed up,''
Watson said in his acceptance speech. Watson also won
song-of-the-year honors for his ``Friend of a Wounded Heart.''
   Veteran gospel singer Shirley Caesar also was a double winner,
taking awards for black gospel song for ``Hold My Mule'' and
traditional black gospel album for ``Live in Chicago.''
   Two heavy metal categories were added to the awards this year
for the first time, and both were won by the four-member group
Stryper. Their ``In God We Trust'' was voted recorded metal gospel
song of the year and also metal album of the year.
   Bruce Carroll was a double winner, taking honors for country
gospel recorded song for ``Above and Beyond'' and country gospel
album for ``Richest Man in Town.''
   The awards are called the Dove Awards to signify the bird that
appeared in the biblical account of the baptism of Christ. Winners
were chosen by the singers, musicians and songwriters in the
3,000-member association, based in Nashville. The ceremonies were
not televised.

   Gymnich Castle, which housed former
President Reagan and other government guests, will become part of
an exclusive resort for well-heeled golf enthusiasts under its new
Japanese owner.
   Developer Masao Nangaku on Thursday unveiled a $72 million
project to turn the castle grounds into a luxurious complex,
including an 18-hole golf course and a hotel for 1,250 guests.
   The 14th-century castle has been used in the past as a
government guest house.
   Reagan and his wife Nancy stayed at Gymnich Castle, about 18
miles from Bonn, on their visit to West Germany and the Western
economic summit in May 1985.
   Baron Joerg Adolf Sigismund von Holzschuher sold the moated,
rose-colored stone castle to Nangaku in 1987 for $15 million. The
castle grounds have belonged to the German aristocratic family
since the 12th century.
   Work on the grounds will not begin until reconstruction of the
main house atop the Petersberg hill overlooking the Rhine River is
completed this year.
   Nangaku heads the Minami-Holdings GmbH company based in nearby
Duesseldorf. He is reputed to be one of Japan's wealthiest men and
a major collector of the works of the late Spanish artist Salvador
Dali.

   White House and congressional budget
negotiators reached a tentative agreement Thursday night on a
framework for the fiscal 1990 budget that sidesteps political pain
for members of both parties.
   Bargainers worked until after 11 p.m., alternatively thrashing
out the details behind closed doors in a Capitol office, and
shopping around parts of the tentative deal to their colleagues.
   Sources said the participants had reached a consensus, but did
not completely rule out a last-minute snag before presenting it to
President Bush at a White House meeting set for Friday morning.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., told reporters as
Thursday's session ended that the negotiators would reconvene in
the morning shortly before the session with Bush.
   ``I'm fairly optimistic we'll have something,'' he said.
   ``It's likely there will be agreement sometime prior to'' the
White House meeting, said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking
Republican on the House Budget Committee. ``In fact I'd say I'm
almost certain.''
   The month-long talks have been aimed at reaching agreement on a
plan that would slice the deficit for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 to $100 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced
budget law.
   Because the Bush administration and congressional leaders have
agreed to use optimistic economic projections, they have said they
can hit the target by agreeing to $28 billion worth of savings.
   The fiscal 1989 deficit is expected to exceed $170 billion, and
many economists and others believe that the budget negotiators
would have to find billions of dollars more in savings if they used
more realistic assumptions. The optimistic projections negate the
need for even tougher savings decisions.
   Negotiators have been discussing splitting the savings evenly
between spending reductions and new revenues.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing Ways
and Means Committee, confirmed Thursday that the bargainers had
agreed to pick up $5.3 billion in additional taxes.
   Bush has insisted often that he will live up to his campaign
pledge of opposing what he calls ``new taxes.'' The agreement _
which leaves the decisions on the types of taxes for later _ allows
Bush to claim he has honored that promise.
   Bush favors raising $4.8 billion by cutting capital gains taxes,
which he says would prod the economy. Democrats oppose the idea.
   The rest of the revenue would come from selling federal assets
and raising fees the government charges for certain services.
   On the spending side, about half the savings would come from
restraining the projected growth in benefit programs that are
automatically paid to recipients, such as the Medicare health
program for the elderly and disabled.
   Negotiators have discussed gimmicks, such as claiming up to $2
billion in savings by moving the U.S. Postal Service
``off-budget,'' and close to $1 billion by shifting some farm
subsidy payments planned for 1990 into this year.
   Even if an agreement is announced, Congress will have to enact a
budget resolution reflecting the pact. The legal deadline for that
resolution is April 15, and as usual lawmakers will miss it by at
least several weeks. Spending and tax legislation reflecting the
budget's strictures then follows.

<TEXT>
   ``Finished this day and I hope it's good,'' John
Steinbeck wrote in his journal in 1938.
   The book he had just completed was ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' a
novel that would awaken the social conscience of Americans in a way
that ``Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' ``The Jungle'' and few other works f
fiction have.
   Viking Press, which published ``The Grapes of Wrath'' on April
14, 1939, is marking the 50th anniversary of the book with a
commemorative edition containing an introduction by Studs Terkel.
It is also publishing ``Working Days,'' journals Steinbeck kept
during the research and writing of what critics consider his
greatest work.
   When he sat down to write his saga of the Joads, a Dust Bowl
family migrating to California for a new life, Steinbeck, 36, had
already attained celebrity with ``Tortilla Flat,'' ``Of Mice and
Men'' (which had been made into a long-running Broadway play) and
four other novels.
   He wrote what he called his ``big book'' in a five-month
marathon, scribbling a prodigious 2,000 words a day. Steinbeck
scholar Robert DeMott, who edited the journals for publication,
notes that the manuscripts strikingly show little revision.
   But the author had already laid much groundwork, having studied
the migrant farmers from Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and Arkansas _
derisively dubbed ``Okies'' _ for a series of articles that
appeared in The San Francisco News. He had bought an old bakery
truck and equipped it with blankets, food and camping equipment and
spent time in a migrant resettling camp. (Contrary to popular myth,
he never made the trek from Oklahoma to California, as did his
fictional Joads.)
   Steinbeck had also written a 70,000-word precursor to ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' that he destroyed, saying the novel was too
vicious and ``smart-alec,'' too much of a political tract. But it
rid him of some of the venom he felt against the Associated Farmers
Inc. and others he felt responsible for the workers' plight, and
allowed him to write what he thought was a more rounded novel.
   Indeed, the question most frequently debated about ``The Grapes
of Wrath,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, is whether it is art or
firebrand propaganda.

<TEXT>
   ``Sure, cried the tenant farmers, but it's our land. We were
born on it, and got killed on it, and we died on it. Even if it's
no good, it's still ours. That's what makes it ours. ... That makes
ownership, not a paper with numbers on it.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Immediately after its release, newspaper editorials, legislators
and farmers decried the novel as a distorted portrait of migrant
life. The book was burned in several cities, including Salinas,
Calif., Steinbeck's hometown, and was banned in many libraries and
schools.
   Eleanor Roosevelt defended the book in her weekly column, and in
1940 a congressional committee held hearings in Oklahoma to find
out whether the squalid conditions and brutal treatment of the
workers recounted in the novel were accurate. The committee's
findings vindicated the author.
   Upon Steinbeck's death in 1968, The New York Times wrote the
following about the book: ``The timorous and savagely reactionary
among us were fretfully afraid that Steinbeck had gone too far in
his novel's portrayal of the desperately distressed in America.
Bless their hearts, they were dead right. He was out to rouse, not
to soothe us into asking human beings to starve quietly and
inconspiculously during those years of Depression and despair.''
   Terkel said he finds modern-day critics who call ``The Grapes of
Wrath'' propaganda ``pretty tiresome.''
   ``You can can say `Moby Dick' is propaganda,'' the author and
radio raconteur said in a telephone interview from his Chicago
office.
   Terkel, who toured the Midwest in 1987 when family farms were
foreclosing one after another, and who witnessed the drought of
1988 played out on the six o'clock news, finds Steinbeck's words
startlingly relevant today.
   ``It's as though we never experienced the Depression and hadn't
learned anything from it,'' said Terkel, who planned to mark the
anniversary by reading from the novel on his radio show,
interspersed with selections from ``Dustbowl Ballads'' by Woody
Guthrie.
   It should be noted that while critics hashed out the literary
merits of the book, the public snapped it up in droves. It was the
best-selling book of 1939 and one of the top 10 best-sellers in
1940. It also prduced a successful movie adaptation starring Henry
Fonda that won director John Ford an Academy Award.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' remains one of Viking's all-time
best-sellers today and has sold some 14 million copies worldwide,
said Viking spokesman Paul Slovak.

   ``In the evening a strange thing happened; the 20 families

<TEXT>
   In awarding Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962,
the Swedish Academy cited the ``towering standard'' the author set
in ``The Grapes of Wrath'' more than two decades earlier, although
he had produced more than a dozen novels and plays since that work.
   DeMott, founder of The Steinbeck Quarterly and an English
professor at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, says in the preface
of ``Working Days'' that Steinbeck's legacy was ``his willingness
to risk everything to write the best he could with what what gifts
he had, and in doing so to reveal, unblinking, the enduring human
spirit among the ruthless shapes of paradise.''

   Violence and human sacrifice among believers in
occult religions usually involve a mixture of pantheistic beliefs
that often are distortions of ancient rituals.
   That kind of mingling and twisting of strange, heterodox ideas
and practices seemed apparent in the gruesome killings of at least
13 people near Matamoros, Mexico, across the Rio Grande from
Brownsville, Texas.
   There were hints of assorted primitive religions and
superstitions, perhaps stemming from traditions such as these, or
aberrations of them:
   _Satanism is characterized by its antagonism toward the
Christian deity and worship of the adversary, Satan. Devotees
consider him a supreme being of evil, rivaling God.
   Their rites consist of mockery or perversion of Christian
ritual, sometimes called the Black Mass at which Satan is believed
to preside. Ritual killings sometimes have been associated with the
cult.
   It also has been linked to assorted sexual, sado-masochistic and
psychopathic activities, including grave robberies and
blood-letting, both animal and human.
   Symbols of the cult include the pentagram, a five-pointed star
with the single point down, and the ``horned god'' in the form of a
goat.
   _Voodoo is a set of animistic beliefs and rites stemming from
Africa, and sometimes interweaving Roman Catholic practices in its
form that became pervasive in Haiti.
   Voodoo worshipers believe in one God but also in numerous
spirits or lesser deities. Magic and witchcraft have proliferated
in relation to voodoo, including casting of spells and fates on
others, good or ill. This often involves use of effigies of
another, along with bits of clothing or hair from the person.
   Certain advanced practicioners, or ``houngans,'' are considered
healers, also enabled to take posssession of the spirit of others.
Singing and dancing are part of the rituals.
   The chief deity is called ``Damballah,'' sometimes symbolized by
a serpent.
   _Santeria is an offshoot of voodoo that has spread into Latin
America and which calls its main god ``Chango,'' a god of fire and
stone. Santeria, like voodoo, involves use of various botanical
ingredients and other items considered magic.
   Related cults have derived from Santeria with pantheons of gods
such as Elegba, god of luck; Ogun, god of metal; Ifa, god of
divination, and Eshju, the trickster.
   Practices of Santeria and its related cults include animal
sacrifice, polygamy, ecstatic dancing and the appeasement of gods
by various offerings.
   Derivatives of these cults and aberrations of them also have
turned up in various parts of the United States.

   Villagers in southern Lebanon got their
wish. The Irish government has decided to keep its 750-man
batallion in the United Nations peacekeeping forces here.
   The government in Dublin had been reconsidering the Irish
battalion's presence in Lebanon because four of its soldiers had
been killed and one wounded in three attacks in the past three
months. Three of them were killed by a landmine March 21.
   ``We greatly need the Irish contingent in south Lebanon,'' said
Abbas Fawaz, the mayor of Tibnin, a town 11 miles north of the
Israeli border.
   The estimated 100,000 Shiite Moslems living in 20 hamlets around
Tibnin, the Irish headquarters, ``enjoy their protection,'' Fawaz
said.
   Before making the decision, the Irish Cabinet reviewed a report
by Lt. Gen. Tadhg O'Neill, chief of staff of the Irish army, who
had come here to investigate the landmine explosion March 21.
   The Cabinet renews Ireland's commitment every six months, and
the Irish political opposition had called for a policy review after
the deaths. The fourth death occurred earlier.
   ``Our presence here is very vital to the security of the area
and to the locals who depend on our humanitarian aide,'' said Lt.
Col. Pat McMahon, commander of the Irish contingent in the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
   On March 30, hundreds of Tebnin's 5,000 residents participated
in a memorial ceremony for the three Irish soldiers killed by the
landmine.
   ``The Irish contingent lives among its people in the south,''
said one of the banners at the ceremony. ``Aggression against it is
aggression on the southerners.''
   The U.N. peacekeeping force, made up of 5,800 personnel from
nine nations, has monitored a narrow strip of 65towns and villages
in south Lebanon since March 1985.
   The population in the force's area of operation increased from
about 50,000 when the force first arrived to about a half million
people today.
   ``Before UNIFIL came to south Lebanon ... the area was a free
terrain to militiamen and terrorists who spread fear and death
everywhere,'' said Fawaz, 64, who has been mayor for 20 years.
   ``Now everyone is moving around here peacefully and freely,
thanks to the Irish battalion.''
   An Irish sergeant about to be moved out on routine rotation said
he was leaving with mixed feelings.
   ``There are a lot of poor people here who are in great need of
our humanitarian work, which is worth risking my life for,'' said
the sergeant who could not allow his name to be used because of
standing regulations.
   An Irish major at headquarters in Tebnin said it ``would be a
fire zone without us.''
   ``When the Irish battalion first came here, the villagers did
not have any electricity and had shortages of water,'' he said,
``But we helped them, and now they are confident in their future
because of us.''
   The Irish battalion has lost 30 soldiers in attacks by various
groups over the years.
   Investigations were still under way to determine who planted the
landmine that exploded under a UNIFIL jeep near Haddatha on March
21 and killed the three soldiers, Lt. Col. Patrick Hayes said.
   The other two recent attacks were carried out by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, which controls a
narrow strip of Lebanese territory that Israel refers to as its
``security zone.''
   Israel maintained the zone when it pulled out the bulk of its
invading army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985, ending a
three-year occupation.
   The terrain, which extends from the Mediterranean Sea in the
west to the slopes of snow-peaked Mount Hermon in the east, serves
as a buffer against cross-border infiltrations by Palestinian
guerrillas into northern Israeli settlements.
   Col. McMahon blamed Israel for the South Lebanon Army attacks on
the Irish battalion. He said such hostilities were due to ``the
lack of control from the Israeli army command on the SLA
militiamen.''
   Hassan Fawaz, the son of Tebnin's mayor who owns a gift shop
near the Irish battalion headquarters, said, ``Tebnin residents
notify the Irish command about the possibility of any attack on
them that we come to know of.''
   The younger Fawaz stressed the economic value that the Irish
battalion represents to the area. The troops spend at least
$500,000 annually on souvenirs and goods they buy duty-free from
local stores.

   Abbie Hoffman, the Yippie who clung to his '60s
ideals amid an onslaught of '80s yuppiedom, was remembered Thursday
as a radical and a joker who could provoke a laugh even as he
outraged and informed.
   ``It's like a hallucination,'' Jerry Rubin said of Hoffman's
death. ``I still don't believe it, frankly. I still think it's an
Abbie media event.''
   Hoffman, 52 years old and still anti-establishment as ever, died
peacefully in his bed Wednesday, according to Michael Waldron, his
landlord in New Hope, Pa.
   An autopsy to determine the cause of death was inconclusive, and
Bucks County District Attorney Alan Rubenstein said toxicological
tests would begin Friday.
   Hoffman's mother said the family assumed Hoffman had committed
suicide. He had sounded very depressed in recent telephone
conversations with his brother, Jack, she said.
   ``He had to do what he had to do,'' Florence Hoffman, 83, said
from her Worcester, Mass., home. ``I don't know why; I don't know
what happened.''
   Rubin, who co-founded the Youth International Party with Hoffman
during the heyday of drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and pie-throwing,
recalled that ``Abbie was a very, very serious person. But he did
it all with a smile.''
   ``During the Chicago (Seven) trial, he got the prosecution
laughing, he got the judge laughing, he got the jury laughing _ he
blew kisses to the jury. He was extremely disarming,'' said Rubin,
now an entrepreneur.
   His hair a tangle of long, wild curls, Hoffman could be seen
with the word ``FREE'' written on his forehead. He was arrested 42
times, the last two years ago when he protested CIA recruitment at
the University of Massachusetts.
   In a satiric gesture, he threw dollar bills on the floor of the
American Stock Exchange in the late '60s, and people scrambled to
pick them up. He went on television in the early '70s and talked
about censorship, while his upper body was blacked out because he
was wearing an American flag shirt.
   He wrote books ``Revolution for the Hell of It'' and ``Steal
This Book.''
   ``He was always thinking ahead and always laughing,'' agreed
folk singer Pete Seeger, who most recently worked with Hoffman on
environmental causes.
   Hoffman's chutzpah also carried him through 6{ years on the run.
   In September 1980, he turned himself in to New York authorities
on a 1973 charge of selling 3 pounds of cocaine. For three years,
he had lived as screenwriter Barry Freed in Fineview, N.Y. _
playing on a softball team against the U.S. Customs Service and
speaking on local television and radio shows about environmental
issues.
   As Freed, he even testified before Senate subcommittee hearings
_ and posed for a picture with an unaware Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
   ``The humor promoted the message,'' said fellow '60s denizen
Mark Rudd, now an author and lecturer living in Albuquerque, N.M.
``He was a genius at crystallizing people's feelings.''
   ``Once, in 1968, we are at a movement conference that was
getting too serious. He got up while I was talking and put on a
great show of skill with his electric yo-yo.''
   But there was a darker side, as well.
   Friends reported that Hoffman had seemed depressed before his
death, according to Bucks County District Attorney Alan M.
Rubenstein.
   ``A longterm depression was the flip side of his high. The thing
about Abbie is that he was a visionary, possibly because he was
manic-depressive,'' Rudd said.
   ``He was 52 years old and I think he gave up,'' said his
brother, Jack Hoffman, of Framingham, Mass. ``I know he was
disappointed in the young people of today. He didn't feel he was
getting through to them. He was disenchanted.''
   ``The question of disillusionment? Never, never, never,'' Rudd
said. ``He had never given up. He was very hopeful.''
   ``I think (he felt) more disappointment than bitterness,'' Rubin
said. ``I think he was disappointed that the social excitement of
the '60s did not continue.''
   Just last week, Hoffman, who criticized college campuses in
recent years as ``bastions of rest,'' said while appearing at
Vanderbilt University that he was saddened by the interest today's
young people have in the 1960s.
   ``When you see young people nostalgic for a youth they didn't
even experience, it's a little sad,'' he said during the appearance
with Timothy Leary. ``They're supposed to be out making one for
themselves.''
   On another occasion, he said: ``1968 was a great, wonderful
year. They don't make years like that anymore. And if it weren't
for our efforts, we'd have a president today sending troops off to
exotic countries like Lebanon and Grenada and bombing cities like
Tripoli.''
   Hoffman made the most out of his own life, compatriots said.
   ``He caused millions of youths to unite behind him to protest
this war in Vietnam,'' said Bobby Seale, the former Black Panther
leader.
   ``He was an important person of my generation and he will be
dearly missed,'' said California Assemblyman Tom Hayden, a Chicago
Seven defendant.
   ``He embodied the great American virtue of protest and
dissidence and speaking truth to authority,'' Rudd said. ``He was
kind of like our Thoreau.''
   Jack Hoffman borrowed a quote from his brother to praise his
iconoclastic life.
   ``Abbie would probably like to be remembered in these, his own
words: `There is absolutely no greater high than challenging the
power structure as a nobody, giving it your all and winning.'''

<HEAD>Former '60s Radical Abbie Hoffman Found Dead</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `An autopsy ..., to UPDATE with results inconclusive,
toxicology tests slated.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Abbie Hoffman, the 1960s radical who lived
a life of tumult and uproar, died peacefully in his bed, his
landlord said Thursday. He was 52.
   Michael Waldron, who rented an apartment in a 400-foot-long
converted turkey shed to Hoffman, said he had been busy with
projects and concerned about the environment in his last few weeks.
   ``I saw him every day. He was always writing, working, cooking
all types of French meals. He was an excellent chef. He came here
to write and relax, and he liked to go out and take walks in the
neighborhood,'' Waldron said.
   ``He always was up and ready to conquer the world.''
   An autopsy Thursday on Hoffman was inconclusive and
toxicological tests were scheduled Friday, authorities said.
   District Attorney Alan M. Rubenstein examined Hoffman's
apartment and said it was ``immaculate,'' with no sign of drugs.
His living room was filled with electronic equipment, including
computers and telephone answering machines.
   Waldron discovered Hoffman's fully dressed body under the covers
of his bed after Hoffman's common-law wife, Joanna Lawrenson,
called Wednesday from her apartment in New York City and said he
wasn't answering his telephone.
   ``I went to his front door. I banged on the door, and then on
the windows. I went around the back and looked in a window, and I
was able to see him lying on the bed,'' Waldron said.
   ``I kept banging and he wasn't responding, and I figured that
something must be wrong, that he was having problems. I went back
to my house and got my key and opened the door, and I found him,
dead in bed, looking peaceful and comfortable,'' Waldron said.
   Hoffman, a good horseman, had been planning to buy a horse and
was working on two books when he died, Waldron said. Hoffman had
written such books as ``Revolution for the Hell of It'' and ``Steal
This Book.''
   Hoffman was very upset about the recent oil spill in Alaska, and
he talked about organizing a boycott of Exxon, Waldron said.
   Jack Hoffman, 49, of Framingham, Mass., borrowed his brother's
words to praise his iconoclastic life.
   ``Abbie would probably like to be remembered in these, his own
words: `There is absolutely no greater high than challenging the
power structure as a nobody, giving it your all and winning.'
   ``Abbie Hoffman ridiculed the powerful and defended the
powerless. He was a true American hero, patriot and dissident. We
live in a freer society today because of him. Abbie Hoffman changed
the world.''
   Hoffman rose to prominence with the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals who stood trial on charges of conspiring to disrupt the
bloody 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was
acquitted of conspiracy and a conviction of crossing state lines
with intent to riot was overturned.
   He also founded the loosely organized Yippie movement, or Youth
International Party, in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest
the government and the Vietnam War.
   Hoffman lived as a fugitive in a cocaine-trafficking case for
years and served two years in work-release program when he
surrendered.
   By his own count, Hoffman was arrested more than 40 times. He
said the government had 67,000 pages of files on him.
   Hoffman, divorced twice, was the father of three children.
Besides his brother, he also is survived by his mother.
   Hoffman said his brother, a native of Worcester, Mass., had
decided to donate his organs and that the body would be cremated.
Tentative arrangements were made for memorial services in Bucks
County, New York and Worcester.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Freezes Action on Three Judicial Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure of three candidates for federal
judge to answer whether the White House screened them on how they
would rule on cases has frozen Senate committee action on the
nominations for at least a week.
   ``We have a responsibility to advise and consent to the
selection of judges and to know what the process was in that
selection,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said Thursday after
calling for a halt in Judiciary Committee action.
   Responding to Kennedy, Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., postponed
for one week consideration of District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer of
Los Angeles as an appellate judge and Robert C. Bonner of Pasadena,
Calif., and Melinda F. Harmon of Houston as district judges.
   None of the three responded to written questions from Kennedy on
whether they had been screened by the administration on how they
might decide cases that could come before them.
   Some lawmakers also were critical of a letter on the subject
sent by the Justice Department on Wednesday. ``It is one of the
most dramatically inept letters I have ever seen come before this
committee,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.
   Kennedy had asked Judge Rymer to ``list all interviews or
communications you had with the White House staff or the Justice
Department regarding your nomination and the dates of such
interviews or communications and identify all persons present or
participating in such interviews.''
   His questions, submitted in writing by Biden, asked if she had
``any communication with any member of the White House staff or the
Justice Department referring or relating to your views on any case,
issue, subject or area of the law that could come before the court
to which you have been nominated.''
   They also asked for names and dates as well as ``any
communication relating to your judicial philosophy or your legal
writings or judicial opinions.'' Similar questions were put to
Harmon and Bonner.
   Biden said that when there was no response to the questions he
contacted the Justice Department and received a ``draft'' letter
replying to the queries. The letter was a draft and not the
finished product because Attorney General Richard Thornburgh could
not show the letter to each of the candidates before sending it to
the committee, the chairman said.
   Phrased as if written by a nominee, the letter said:
   ``1) I did not make any commitments with regard to how I might
rule on any specific case or issue nor were any such commitments
sought.
   ``2) My personal views on controversial cases or issues were not
solicited in a manner to suggest that it should commit myself to
rule in a particular way on issues or cases to advance my nomination
   ``3) I do not believe I have been subjected to an `ideological
litmus test.'
   ``4) I have no doubt that everyone who interviewed me expected
me, if nominated and confirmed, to exercise my best independent
judgment on every matter brought before me.''
   David Runkel, a spokesman for the attorney general, said ``we
think the letter is responsive.''
   Kennedy said that he had not heard of the letter until he was on
his way to the Judiciary Committee session and wanted more time to
consider the issue.

   A contest billed as the nation's first
indoor croquet tournament will include the use of balls that don't
need grass to slow them down.
   At least 50 players from 14 colleges have signed up for the
Third National Collegiate Croquet Tournament at the former Bible
Speaks headquarters in Lenox.
   The three-day tournament, which began today, marked the U.S.
debut of croquet balls invented 18 months ago by Townsend Croquet
Ltd. of England, said organizer Xandra Kayden of Cambridge.
   The hollow balls, filled with fluid and glass beads, create an
internal resistance that slows them as if they were on grass,
company owner Charles Townsend said in a trans-Atlantic call
Thursday. ``The insides swish around and absorb the energy of the
ball on a hard surface,'' he said.
   ``They're wonderful,'' said croquet coach Steven Sprague of
Lenox, whose mother discovered the balls in a Christmas catalog.
``It slows the ball down a little differently than balls slowed by
grass, but you get used to it.''
   Townsend said he invented the balls at the request of several
Britons who wanted to use village halls for croquet matches during
their wet winters. He also invented spikeless wickets that can be
taped to floors.
   The balls have been used in a few small tournaments in England,
but not, to Townsend's knowledge, in the United States. Ms. Kayden
said the Lenox tournament is the first to be played indoors and to
use the balls.

   Steve Lawrence, Nancy Sinatra, Joanne Worley
and Earl Holliman were among the celebrities who turned out to
honor singer Jack Jones as he was awarded a star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame.
   Jones' star is beside one honoring his father, actor-singer
Allan Jones.
   ``There are some good singers and there are some great singers
and then there are some totally original singers,'' singer Mel
Torme said of Jones.
   Jones, 47, earned two Grammy awards for best male vocal
performance for his 1960s hits ``Lollipops and Roses'' and ``Wives
and Lovers.'' But he may be best known to television audiences as
the singer of TV's ``Love Boat'' theme.
   ``Obviously I can't be blase about the whole thing,'' Jones
said. ``This is a big thing.''
   Jones has recorded more than 50 albums. His latest, ``I Am a
Singer,'' will be released this summer on USA Records.

   For weeks after the November election, Susan
Estrich, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis' presidential campaign manager,
disappeared.
   Now Estrich has revealed she was at a health spa with her
husband in Tecate, Mexico, and as she herself describes, she needed
a break.
   ``I had spent 1988 (and three months of the year before) as
Michael Dukakis' campaign manager _ 16 to 18 hours a day, every
day, sitting. My only exercise had been tossing and turning at
night,'' Estrich writes in the April issue of Conde Nast Traveler.
   ``By election day,'' she added, ``Dukakis had lost 40 states and
I had gained 20 pounds.''
   Estrich's disappearance was mysterious enough to warrant
attention in Boston area newspapers which noted that even top
campaign aides had no idea where she was. They simply reported her
quietly packing boxes at the campaign headquarters and leaving.

<HEAD>Foiled Coup Strengthens Haitian Leader's Hand</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The failure of an attempted coup
against Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril has left the Haitian leader in a
stronger position to carry out his U.S.-backed program of
democratic reform and drug busting.
   But events of the past two weeks exposed the continuing threat
to stability posed by the impoverished Caribbean nation's poorly
trained and corruption-ridden army.
   It is a question now of whether Avril, a former adviser to the
Duvalier family dictatorship who became president in a military
coup seven months ago, has the power and the will to fulfill his
pledge of ``irreversible democracy.''
   ``So far, all we have are his democratic promises,'' said a
Western European diplomat. ``Haitians have grown skeptical of such
promises.''
   Diplomats said the trigger for the April 2 coup attempt was
Avril's dismissal the previous week of four army colonels accused
of drug running. Loyal troops rescued the president as he was being
driven, handcuffed, to the airport to be deported.
   The government said the plot was hatched by former Haitian
interior minister and longtime Avril foe, Roger Lafontant, who
lives in the neighboring Dominican Republic, and other exiles
linked to Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who fled into exile in
France in February 1986.
   Four officers _ not those dismissed earlier _ were identified as
ringleaders: Col. Guy Francois, commander of the 750-man Dessalines
Battalion; Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the 400-man Leopards
Corps; Col. Phillipe Biamby, commander of the 1,100-man
Presidential Guard; and Col. Qualo Leonce, an administrative
officer and godson to Lafontant.
   Avril deported Rebu, Biamby and Leonce to New York, where they
were detained by U.S. immigration officials, and Francois
subsequently was given asylum by the Vatican Embassy in
Port-au-Prince.
   No sooner had Avril escaped the coup attempt than the Leopards
and Dessalines rebelled. Loyalist troops crushed the mutiny in a
two-day assault on the Dessalines barracks, adjoining the National
Palace. The Leopards ended their revolt with no further fighting.
   Defeat of the Dessalines Battalion, the army's second biggest
unit and traditional maker and breaker of Haitian presidents, would
appear to remove one of the most serous threats to Avril's
authority.
   The battalion, widely regarded as the most repressive and
corrupt in the army, was previously led by Col. Jean-Claude Paul,
who was indicted on drug charges in Miami and died last November,
reportedly after drinking poisoned soup.
   ``Nobody has been as powerful as Avril is now,'' said Pierre
Raymond Dumas, a prominent Haitian author and military expert.
   He said Avril still faces the task of training the army into a
disciplined force. ``What we have is an armed gang, not a real
army.''
   During their 29-year rule, Jean-Claude and his father, Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who died in 1971, corrupted the officers
corps and encouraged rivarly among units. They promoted zealots
regardless of merit and created a private militia of thugs known as
the Tonton Macoute.
   Avril has fired or forced into retirement more than 140 officers
since coming to power in a Sept. 17 coup led by noncomissioned
officers preaching democracy and respect for human rights.
   He has partially restored the 1987 constitution _ suspended by
his predecessor, the tyrannical Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy _ and
approved the establishment of an electoral council to organize
elections of a civilian government.
   Democratic reform and a crackdown on drug trafficking are among
conditions set by the United States for restoring $70 million in
aid suspended after the abortive elections of November 1987 in
which thugs supported by the army massacred 34 voters at polling
stations.
   U.S. Ambassador Brunson McKinley said the prospects for
democracy are good, provided Avril ``can hold together and continue
to move toward the goal of elections.''
   Although human-rights organizations have accused Avril of
continued abuses, U.S. officials have said they are satisfied with
progress he has made in moving toward democracy.
   ``I expect that within weeks the State Department will announce
a resumption of aid,'' said Larry Birns, director of the
Washington-based Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which has been
critical of U.S. policy on Haiti.
   ``I'm extremely skeptical about Avril as a person, but this
whole affair may force him to accelerate democratization, because
he needs U.S. aid,'' Birns said.
   Avril ``now realizes that without a civilian political base he
is vulnerable to coups. He will likely speed up the democratic
process, not out of any noble cause, but for his own survival.''

<HEAD>Democrats Gird for Bruising Battle over Wright</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are girding for a bruising
battle over the ethics case of their speaker, Jim Wright of Texas,
and acknowledging that the worst may be yet to come.
   ``We haven't hit bottom yet,'' said Rep. Charles Wilson, a
fellow Texan who is among Wright's most battle-ready defenders.
Wilson said he expects more damage to Wright when the House ethics
committee releases its report Monday and formally charges the
speaker with several dozen rules violations.
   But even before the charges were lodged, Wright was beginning
his counteroffensive. In a carefully scripted and sometimes
emotional speech on Thursday, he vehemently denied any intentional
wrongdoing.
   ``I am confident that in the 34 years I've served in the
Congress, I have not violated any of those basic rules nor any
commonly accepted standard of ethical behavior,'' Wright told a
packed room of reporters and television cameras.
   With his top leadership lieutenants and many Texas colleagues at
his side, Wright grew emotional as he defended his wife against a
charge she did not do adequate work for the $18,000-a-year salary
she was paid by a Fort Worth business partner.
   ``My wife is a good, decent, caring, thoroughly honorable
person,'' he said, his voice choking. ``I'll damned well fight to
protect her honor and her integrity against any challenge by any
source, whatever the cost.''
   The defense buoyed Democrats who already support the speaker,
and many seemed prepared to fight.
   ``If you live in a glass house, you shouldn't throw rocks,''
said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas. ``Most of us in the House are
prepared to eat a steady diet of glass for the next few weeks.''
   But others were dreading the battles to come and some expressed
doubts whether the party could afford politically to maintain
Wright as its most visible spokesman _ particularly if the case
leads to punishment.
   ``The ground would start to move under him if he were
reprimanded,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   ``The mood is bleak,'' Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., told The New
York Times. ``There is recognition by virtually all of the people I
would consider professional politicians that he will not survive.''
And he added: ``For the first time, a couple of Texans have said to
me they think it's all over.''
   The ethics committee, six Democrats and six Republicans, put the
final touches on its report late Thursday and scheduled a Monday
morning news conference to release it. The report will include a
``statement of alleged violations'' enumerating several dozen
specific violations of House rules, said sources familiar with the
investigation.
   Under the rules, the panel's standard for issuing such a
citation _ the equivalent of an indictment _ is that it has found
``reason to believe'' the violations occurred. For the committee to
prove those charges requires the more difficult standard of ``clear
and convincing'' evidence.
   Wright asked that he be allowed as soon as possible to go before
the ethics panel and present his defense and begin offering
rebuttal evidence.
   Along with the concern over Wright's standing came worry that
the ethics committee might be setting a new and more difficult
standard for congressional behavior, particularly in calling a
spouse's income a ``gift'' and in determining that the business
partner who paid Mrs. Wright, George Mallick, had a direct interest
in legislation before the Congress.
   Mallick paid Mrs. Wright's salary and gave the Wrights free use
of a condominium in Fort Worth and a 1979 Cadillac. Under the
rules, a lawmaker can accept no more than $100 a year in gifts from
a person with direct legislative interests.
   On that issue, the most potentially damaging to Wright among all
the charges, the ethics committee voted 8-4 to find ``reason to
believe'' the gifts to the Wrights were improper, with Democrats
Chet Atkins of Massachusetts and Bernard Dwyer of New Jersey siding
with the six committee Republicans.
   One source said the panel based its finding not on any specific
interest Mallick had, but on the more general grounds that as an
investor in real estate and oil and gas ventures he had an inherent
direct interest in congressional action on matters such as savings
and loan regulation and taxation.
   The other issues were more clear cut, the source said. On
whether the car and condominium constituted unreported gifts, the
panel was unanimous. The vote was 10-2 to place Mrs. Wright's
salary in that category. And it also was 10-2 to hold that Wright
sought to evade outside income limits through bulk sales of his
book, ``Reflections of a Public Man.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable television executives have for the first
time publicly demonstrated their ability to transmit a
high-definition TV signal completely through a ``typical'' cable
system.
   The test was carried out Thursday on Jones Intercable facilities
in Anne Arundel County, Md., northeast of Washington and on Media
General Cable equipment in Fairfax County, Va., last week.
   The demonstration was designed to show that regular coaxial
cable can carry an HDTV picture to a TV receiver with existing
technology and without significant loss of quality.
   Officials of the National Cable Television Association declared
the test a success and said it shows that it is not necessary to
have expensive fiber-optic cable systems to provide advanced
television service.
   Telephone companies, currently barred from providing cable
programming or cable service in their telephone areas, are seen as
having a potential major role in the market and are advocating use
of glass fiber cables that transmit voice, video and data signals
on laser beams.
   Brenda Fox, NCTA vice president and general counsel, told
reporters at Thursday's demonstration that it shows coaxial, or
bundled wire, cables can ``retransmit the quality of picture and
sound that everyone talks about in high-definition television.''
   She said the 40-channel Jones Intercable is a typical cable
system and the successful test shows ``we can transmit an HDTV
signal on classic systems around the country.''
   Proponents of high-definition television say it can provide
pictures with the quality of 35mm film and sound equivalent to
compact disc recordings.
   Thursday's demonstration did, indeed, show very high-quality
images of ice skaters, the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, movie clips
and boxer Mike Tyson on three separate receivers: a 50-inch
projection TV; a 32-inch cathode ray tube set; and a smaller CRT in
which the HDTV signal was converted to the so-called NTSC signal
that standard sets display.
   The demonstration utilized a Japanese MUSE-E HDTV signal that
was sent from Home Box Office facilities in Long Island, N.Y., to
the SATCOM K1 satellite and relayed to a Jones Intercable receiving
dish on the ground.
   From there the signal was sent through 28 miles of coaxial
cable, including 26 amplifiers, and then displayed on the three TV
sets, NCTA said.
   Cable executives said it was the first ``end-to-end'' HDTV test
in which all elements of a delivery system, from program
origination point to the TV set, were used.
   Paul Heimbach, HBO's vice president of engineering, said the
test provided a ``very acceptable'' signal at the end.
   HBO may be one of the first companies in this country to provide
HDTV programs, particularly if the Japanese, as expected, begin to
introduce HDTV receivers, VCRs and video discs into this country.
   The Japanese already are far ahead of U.S. companies in
developing HDTV and made a small-scale test of a
satellite-delivered system earlier this month.
   Heimbach said that since most of HBO's programs already are 35mm
films, it would be a natural progression for HBO to enter the HDTV
arena once the demand is there.
   HDTV won't be cheap. TV sets are expected to be in the
$3,000-$4,000 range initially. And it is possible that programming
will cost more than at present.
   But Heimbach said preliminary results of a recent survey of
consumers in Kansas City, Mo., showed about a third of those who
viewed an HDTV test said they'd willing to pay more to receive HDTV.
   NCTA will continue to test HDTV systems as they become
available. A number of American, Japanese and European systems have
been proposed, but so far only Japan has developed equipment
capable of testing.
   The Federal Communications Commission ruled last year that any
U.S. HDTV system cannot make existing NTSC TV sets obsolete. The
MUSE-E system is not compatible with current sets.
   Fox said cable executives want to try to reach agreement with
over-the-air broadcasters on a common HDTV standard.
   ``We're not trying to beat the other guy,'' she said.

<HEAD>Letters Columns Swell With Alaskans' Angry Responses To Spill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In newspaper columns and editorial
pages, Alaskans are unleashing their fury at the oil spill that has
defiled Prince William Sound and imperiled livelihoods drawn from
the sea.
   The volume of letters to newspaper editors in some areas remains
high even three weeks after the spill that sent 10.1 million
gallons of oil into the sound, and at least two editorial boards
have recast their positions on a tax change for oil companies.
   Editors of the two Anchorage daily newspapers said they can
think of no other issue that has generated so much mail. Much of it
has hammered the oil industry.
   ``We're busier than we've ever been,'' said Michael Carey,
editorial page editor of the Anchorage Daily News, which on April 9
devoted a section front and inside space to letters about the spill.
   Anchorage Times Editor in Chief William J. Tobin said most of
his in-state mail has condemned Exxon, the owner of the tanker
involved in the spill.
   ``The tone of the letters from outside (the state) says, in
effect, `Alaska, we mourn with you in this terrible tragedy,'''
Tobin said.
   ``I really haven't seen (a letter) yet that was favorable to the
oil companies,'' said Andy Williams, editorial page editor of the
Fairbanks Daily News-Miner.
   Even industry friend Val Molyneux, president of the Alaska
Support Industry Alliance, was cautious in a letter sent to the
Homer News and several other papers.
   ``We, as Alaskans, share in a collective sense of loss and shock
as a result of the tragedy in Prince William Sound,'' Molyneux
wrote. ``There must be a lesson learned.''
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Molyneux said that despite
the Exxon accident, Alaskans should not forget the good things the
oil industry has brought.
   ``I still believe the long-term future of the state is in the
resources, and the major resource is oil,'' Molyneux said.
   That is apparently on the minds of few letter writers.
   ``The oil industry has created a system that is a disaster
waiting to happen,'' wrote Lara Purtel in the Anchorage Daily News.
Another reader, James Sykes, said oil companies had little
incentive to guard against spills or conduct speedy cleanups
because of liability limits, spill-related tax write-offs and the
ability to raise gasoline prices.
   Among the few letters supportive of the oil industry was one
from Suzanne McLaughlin of Anchorage.
   ``Oil really does feed my family and pay my taxes,'' she wrote
in a letter in The Anchorage Times. ``And don't kid yourself _ it
does yours, too.''
   Oil finances 85 percent of Alaska's state budget, and it was oil
wealth that created the Permanent Fund, a state savings account
that generates annual dividends for Alaskans. The 1988 payment for
every qualified man, woman and child in the state topped $800.
   To most editorial writers, the figures behind the industry's
impact on Alaska wealth are as familiar as their home phone
numbers. But two newspapers say the statistics are no longer
sufficient to support positions they held less than a month ago
giving tax breaks to the oil industry.
   The tax structure was altered to reduce the burden on oil
companies as marginal oil fields declined, but the still-rich
Prudhoe Bay region was inadvertently included as well. An effort is
underway to revise the structure, which now provides oil companies
with a $150 million annual tax break.
   The Ketchikan Daily News modified its position on the proposed
revision, and the Juneau Empire reversed its stand.
   Ketchikan Daily News Publisher Lew Williams said his newspaper
had been ``wavering'' on the tax issue, ``but there's no wavering
now. We've got to make some changes and get some money'' from the
oil companies.
   ``Before, we felt as though the oil industry had been paying its
share of the cost of running state government,'' said Carl Sampson,
Empire managing editor. ``Two and a half weeks ago, though, we
started thinking about ... some of the non-monetary costs that
would come out of the oil spill.
   ``We felt as though there had been a betrayal of trust between
Alaskans and the oil companies.''

<HEAD>Wright Problems Becoming Democratic Party Problems</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ohio Democratic Party chairman put the
best political face on the nerve-wrenching drama surrounding the
speaker of the House: ``My candidate for mayor of Toledo isn't
going to be hurt by Jim Wright,'' he said.
   But many Democrats fear Wright's troubles are their troubles.
   The Texas congressman is the party's highest ranking elected
official and one of its most visible spokesmen.
   As such he is an easy target for Republicans, their House
leadership sharpened by the recent selection of Wright tormentor
Newt Gingrich as GOP whip.
   Among House Democrats as well as among party officials across
the country, the concern was palpable Thursday as it became clear
the House ethics committee was prepared to charge Wright with
violating House rules.
   ``I'm not hearing much,'' said Iowa Democratic Party chairman
Bonnie Campbell, when asked if Wright was becoming a political
issue in her state. ``To the extent I do, it's Democrats fearing
the worst.''
   The speaker went on the offensive, declaring that he was
``confident that in the 34 years I have been in the Congress, I
have not violated those basic rules, nor any commonly accepted
standard of ethical conduct.''
   He vowed to ``fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy
that I possess'' to clear ``my good name.''
   Watching on television as Wright defended himself was Charles
Whitehead, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party.
   ``It certainly doesn't help us,'' Whitehead said later. ``It
gives the Republicans an awful lot of openings.''
   Jim Ruvolo, Whitehead's Ohio counterpart, said, ``It obviously
depends on the extent of the charges, how seriously they're
perceived in terms of his personal integrity. If he makes a
convincing case that these are minor infractions and he regrets
them, then they may not have long repercussions.
   ``If he's unable to do that, clearly then it's a problem for
Democrats and some Democrats have to sit down and talk to him about
it,'' Ruvolo said. ``The next couple of days will tell because it's
going to be on the news tonight.''
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., said, ``I think there's deep concern,
both as to the person of the speaker and the Congress itself. Agony
is probably the best word.''
   But Greg Schneiders, a Democratic political consultant,
questioned whether there would be much political impact from
Wright's problems.
   ``Voters are so cynical about politicians in general that
whenever they hear about a politician doing something or being
charged with unethical activity, they say, `So what else is new?'
They assume that about politicians until it gets to a point where
it is really unacceptable,'' Schneiders said.
   He said he does not believe the allegations against Wright have
``captured the public imagination.''
   Whitehead disagreed about the depth of cynicism.
   ``I don't think it's gotten that bad yet,'' he said. ``They're
cynical, yes. They expect some wrongdoing. And in Wright's defense,
I think this will be played out of proportion.''
   When the speaker appeared before reporters to defend himself, he
was flanked by the House Democratic leadership.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., next in line to
Wright, said the speaker's arguments were ``very moving and very
persuasive. Support for the speaker remains very, very strong
indeed among many Democrats.''
   Asked whether he'd be more comfortable with Wright or Foley
speaking for his party, Whitehead replied:
   ``At this particular time, I would feel much more comfortable if
it was Tom Foley and I would think that any Democrat who would be
honest and candid would say that.''

<HEAD>Democratic Whip Says He and Not Campaign Committee Purchased Bond</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho blames an
error by an investment firm for records listing his campaign
committee as the buyer of a $100,000 junk bond when in reality he
purchased it himself.
   ``I borrowed the money, made the investment, sold it, made a
profit and reported the transaction on my financial disclosure
statement for 1986 as I am required to do,'' the California
lawmaker said Thursday in a statement.
   Conversion of campaign funds to personal use is against House
rules.
   The third-ranking Democrat in the House acknowledged that
records of the brokerage firm of Drexel, Burnham, Lambert listed
``Coelho for Congress'' as the purchaser of the bond on April 10,
1986.
   An aide, David Dreyer, said it remains unresolved why Coelho's
records show he bought it the following month.
   ``We're going by our records,'' Dreyer said. The bond was sold
in October on the vice of Coelho's accountant, the statement said,
at a profit of $6,882.
   Drexel propelled itself into the vanguard of the 1980s corporate
buyout binge by developing the technique of financing such
operations with junk bonds, so called because they pay high
interest but also represent high risk. Since then, however, the
firm's Beverly Hills-based junk bond operation has been rocked by
scandal.
   Drexel's junk bond king Michael Milken and two others were
indicted March 29 by a federal grand jury in New York on fraud and
racketeering charges.
   Coelho's statement said that as the ``result of an error made by
Drexel, Burnham, Lambert Inc., my campaign committee was
inaccurately carried as the purchaser, even though it provided no
money for the investment.''
   ``Repeated efforts by my staff to correct what I now believe to
be a computer error made by Drexel finally resulted in my name
being accurately listed,'' he said. He said his decision to buy
``had nothing to do with either Drexel, Mike Milken or an employee
of Drexel, and neither Drexel nor Milken recommended it to me.''
   ``The purchase was reviewed and approved by my accountant as
reasonable and prudent, and I relied on my accountant for that kind
of advice,'' he said.
   ``It was this kind of situation,'' he said, ``among other
reasons, that prompted me to put my investments in a blind trust.''
   A letter to Harris Trust and Savings of Chicago, made public by
Coelho's office, said Drexel erroneously set this account under
Coelho for Congress.
   ``It has since been changed to Tony Coelho and ... I would
appreciate it if you would reissue the check to Tony Coelho
personally,'' said the letter dated Oct. 21, 1986, and signed by
Coelho administrative assistant Fred Hatfield.
   Aides to Coelho and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said that
Cranston, at the urging of Coelho, wrote to the Securities and
Exchange Commission to warn of the harmful effect on the Los
Angeles-area employment situation if the agency went ahead with a
plan to close Milken's Beverly Hills headquarters.
   Coelho, himself, however, did not write such a letter, Dreyer
said.

   The House ethics committee will have
considerable work to do on the Jim Wright case, even if it grants
the speaker's request to appear quickly to defend himself against
allegations he broke House rules.
   There could be weeks and even months of committee legal
proceedings before the panel _ officially called the Committee on
Standards of Official Conduct _ would make a recommendation to the
full House.
   Those recommendations could include no punishment, a fine, a
reprimand, a censure, or, in the most extreme case, expulsion. A
reprimand involves a House vote. A censure requires the additional
step of calling the member to the front of the chamber, to have the
censure resolution read to him.
   The next step for the committee in the Wright case will come
next week, when it issues a statement of alleged violations.
   This is similar to an indictment, and based on a finding that
``there is reason to believe'' violations occurred. Each alleged
violation must be listed as a separate count.
   The statement will then trigger other proceedings.
   The accused would have at least 21 days to provide a response,
which must be in writing.
   Wright could object to any count ``on the grounds that it fails
to state facts which constitute a violation.''
   If Wright files any motions, such as a motion to dismiss, the
committee would have 30 days to make a ruling. The speaker would
then have 14 days to respond to each count not dismissed.
   Any of these timetables can be changed by the panel chairman,
Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., who can make proceedings go faster or
slower.
   After the timetables expire, the committee would vote either to
hold a disciplinary hearing or to defer action. The latter course
is reserved for cases where a judicial proceeding is pending.
Failure to achieve a majority for either action would constitute a
dismissal of the statement of alleged violations.
   A disciplinary hearing is held in two parts.
   The first phase would determine whether or not the counts have
been proved. Counts are considered proved by a majority vote.
During this phase, witnesses for and against the person charged
could be heard and cross-examined. The burden of proof rests with
committee staff.
   The second phase would determine what action to recommend to the
House.
   If the committee decides a violation is technical, it could
direct that the violation be reported to the House without a
recommendation for a sanction.
   A reprimand is considered appropriate for serious violations,
censure is for more serious violations and expulsion is for the
most serious violations.
   A fine is considered appropriate if it is likely the violation
was committed to secure a financial benefit.

<HEAD>First Jury Conviction Obtained in Procurement Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation into the military's
$150-billion-a-year purchasing system is ``exanding and
continuing,'' a prosecutor said after the first jury convictions in
the Pentagon procurement scandal.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica said Thursday after
guilty verdicts were obtained against California businessmen George
Kaub and Eugene Sullivan that his office is moving ahead with the
investigation into kickbacks and payoffs.
   Kaub and Sullivan, former vice presidents of Teledyne
Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., were the first people to go
trial as a result of the investigation, which began in mid-1986.
   About a dozen people and defense contracting firms had pleaded
guilty, including three men who were indicted with the Teledyne
executives in January. Teledyne Industries, the parent of Teledyne
Electronics, had also pleaded guilty to conspiracy and filing false
statements in advance of the trial. The company paid about $4.3
million in fines, penalties and damages.
   A jury deliberated nearly 36 hours over four days before finding
both men guilty of conspiracy and wire fraud in a scheme
prosecutors said involved paying a private consultant who in turn
bribed a Navy engineer for illegal assistance in helping Teledyne
win a lucrative contract.
   Kaub was also convicted of filing false statements, a charge
that derived from providing documents to the Defense Department
which omitted information about private consultants.
   The jury failed to reach a verdict on the conspiracy and wire
fraud charges against Dale Schnittjer, another former Teledyne
executive. U.S. District Judge Richard Williams then dismissed the
charges. All the defendants were found innocent of bribery.
   Aronica called the convictions ``significant'' and said they
marked only the start of the prosecutorial phase of the Ill Wind
investigation. ``The investigation is expanding and continuing,''
he said.
   Mark Tuohey, Kaub's attorney, said he would appeal the guilty
verdict against his client, who faces a maximum sentence of 40
years in jail and a fine of $2 million for conviction on eight
counts. Kaub hung his head and stared at the defense table after
the bailiff read the verdict.
   Sullivan, whose lawyer, George O'Connell, said he would also
appeal, could be sentenced to 20 years in jail and fined a maximum
of $1 million. He appeared impassive after hearing he had been
convicted on four counts.
   Williams set sentencing for June 7.
   Aronica argued during the trial that the defendants knew private
consultant William Parkin engaged in illegal practices when
Teledyne Electronics hired him in November 1985 to help secure a
$24 million contract for hand-held radar equipment.
   Parkin, who had already pleaded guilty and was cooperating with
the government, was paid an initial $10,000. After Teledyne won the
contract in July 1987, he began receiving payments on an additional
$150,000 that the company had promised him.
   Defense attorneys, however, said their clients were the victims
of a conspiracy devised by Parkin, consultant Fred Lackner, Navy
engineer Stuart Berlin and Michael Savaides, another former
Teledyne employee who worked in Washington and had pleaded guilty.
   Like Parkin, Lackner and Berlin were indicted at the same time
the executives were and entered guilty pleas.
   Much of the evidence in the case came from wire taps on Parkin's
telephone. The wire fraud counts stemmed from those tape-recorded
conversations.
   Schnittjer's attorney, Stanley Mortenson, said his client came
to Teledyne Electronics after the company had been awarded the
radar contract.
   But Aronica said Schnittjer was the person who paid Parkin about
$18,000 he was to receive once the Pentagon ordered the equipment
from Teledyne.
   The jury found Schnittjer innocent of four wire fraud counts,
but it could not reach a unanimous decision on whether Schnittjer
was guilty of conspiracy and one count of wire fraud.
   Williams dismissed those counts.
   The Pentagon procurement investigation was publicly disclosed in
June 1988, when federal agents armed with search warrants descended
on defense contractors from coast-to-coast.

<HEAD>EEC, Aerosol Makers Agree On Cuts In Chlorofluorocarbons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aerosol makers in European Economic
Community nations have agreed to sharply reduce the use of
chemicals that harm the earth's protective ozone layer, the EEC
Commission has announced.
   The commission said the Federation of European Aerosol
Manufacturers will voluntarily reduce the use of
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, in aerosol cans by 90 percent by Dec.
31, 1990.
   ``Since the use of CFCs in aerosols accounts for about 45
percent of the total use of CFCs in the Community, we will be
achieving with this voluntary agreement ... a higher reduction than
the 20 percent reduction required'' under the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, the commission said in a statement Thursday.
   The Montreal treaty, signed by 40 nations, is aimed at lowering
the use of chlorofluorocarbons, which have been blamed for the
deterioration of the ozone layer that protects the Earth from the
cancer-causing effects of ultraviolet rays and increases the
greenhouse effect, or heating of the environment.
   Exempted from the voluntary accord with the EEC Commission,
however, are aerosols used in electronics and pharmaceuticals and
some specialized industrial uses, the EEC Commission said.
   It said it will seek similar accords with other trade groups
that use CFCs in their industries, such as makers of refrigerators,
air conditioners, solvents and foam plastics.
   When released into the environment, CFCs rise into stratosphere
where ultraviolet rays break them up releasing chlorine and bromine
atoms that can keep destroying the ozone layer for years.

<HEAD>Pentagon Advisory Board Says Keep Some MX Missiles on Tracks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advisory board to the Pentagon is fueling
new debate on mobile nuclear weapons by saying at least some MX
missiles should travel on their rail-car launchers at all times if
that mode of basing is adopted.
   The Air Force previously has sought to ease public concerns
about nuclear weapons on the rails bysaying such missiles would
leave their armed garrisons only in times of crisis.
   But the influential Defense Science Board said that plan would
be more likely to provoke the Soviets or any other adversary.
   ``The problem with keeping them in the garrison at all times is
that a president could raise tensions higher simply by sending the
trains out _ and wouldn't be prepared to take that risk,'' one
source said Thursday.
   ``That doesn't help your nuclear deterrent any. But if you have
at least a few out there all the time, the Soviets know you're
serious and that you've got a mobile missile that they can't strike
first.''
   The review by the science board was first reported Thursday by
the Los Angeles Times. The Defense Department declined public
comment on the matter.
   The Bush administration _ like Reagan administration before it _
is struggling to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear missile
to America's arsenal. The idea is to make it more difficult for the
Soviet Union to target U.S. forces and thus deter Russia from ever
considering a first-strike attack.
   The Air Force and Pentagon have told Congress they would like to
buy 50 more huge MX missiles and place them on rail-car launchers.
Congressional Democrats, however, would prefer to see the
development of a small, one-warhead Midgetman missile that could be
deployed on a truck launcher.
   Proponents and critics alike agree that placing 50 new MX
missiles on rail cars would be vastly less expensive, about $12
billion, compared with almost $25 billion for 500 Midgetman
missiles. But there is also agreement that a Midgetman force would
probably be more survivable against attack.
   That is because the Air Force, in pushing for mobile MX
missiles, has always stressed it would mollify public safety
concerns by keeping the missiles inside armed garrisons _ ready for
dispersal on the regular rail network only at times of high tension.
   It is that assumption that the science board is preparing to
challenge, said one source.
   The board, comprised of respected civilian scientists and
engineers along with former defense officials, ``has not submitted
a final report yet and probably won't for awhile,'' said one source.
   ``But it does look like they're raising an issue that gets
people excited up on Capitol Hill.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said Thursday he already had heard ``rumblings'' about
the proposal.
   ``It's a way of justifying rail mobile,'' McCain said. ``The
complaint has been that they don't have enough warning time. By
keeping some of them in motion, there's much greater flexibility.''
   McCain, who opposes the idea of trying to fund both the MX
missile and the Midgetman, said the proposal will likely surface in
the first debate ``to lend support to rail garrison.''

   Helicopters from the carrier USS Theodore
Roosevelt rescued 15 Britons from four yachts foundering in rough
seas off Corsica.
   The U.S. 6th Fleet said the 35-foot Harlequin called for help
before dawn Thursday when its captain fell and broke a leg as the
sailboat struggled in 30-foot seas and 70-knot winds. Three other
sailboats sent distress calls by sunrise.
   Capt. Dayton W. Ritt, the Roosevelt's commanding officer, said
helicopters took off from the nuclear-powered carrier at first
light. Fourteen men and one woman were flown to safety during the
six-hour rescue.
   The skipper of the Harlequin, Malcolm Cross, was in stable
condition with a fractured right leg, doctors said. The other crew
members were in good condition aboard the carrier, which is to make
a routine port visit to Monaco today.
   The sailboats were part of a 16-boat flotilla en route from
Toulon, France, to Bonifacio, Corsica.

<HEAD>GAO Report: Seven of Nine Clean Coal Projects Behind Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of nine clean coal technology projects
financed by the federal government are so far behind schedule the
Energy Department can't estimate when they might be done, and three
others are suffering delays, the government says.
   But it is too soon to tell whether the delays ``will affect the
timing of the commercial availability of the clean coal
technologies,'' Keith Fultz, an energy expert with the General
Accounting Office, told a House subcommittee Thursday.
   In his report to the Energy and Power Subcommittee, Fultz blamed
coordination, equipment and financing problems for delays in
demonstration projects that account for about $8 million of the $42
million spent so far by the federal government.
   Four clean coal technology projects ``are in trouble at this
point,'' he said:
   _Ohio Ontario Clean Fuels Inc.'s coal-oil coprocessing project
at Warren, Ohio was about 13 months off track because of difficulty
in getting environmental permits when it experienced economic
problems. The Energy Department could not provide new estimates for
when the project might be completed.
   _Energy International Inc.'s underground coal gasification
project at Rawlings, Wyo., has postponed its completion date by 15{
months because the company has been unable to get private financing.
   _M.W. Kellogg Co.'s advanced coal gasification project proposed
for New York is nine months off schedule because of problems
finding buyers for the power the project would generate.
   _Energy and Environment Research Corp.'s gas reburning project
was delayed for a year because of problems coordinating with
utilities participating in the project, complying with
environmental requirements and needed cost-cutting measures.
   Fultz said he's concerned that the clean coal demonstration
projects having the most difficulty are the ones in which the
federal government has agreed to pick up a large share of the costs.
   ``These four projects have the highest rate of federal money,''
he said. ``Two of them are 50 percent (taxpayer backed) and the
other two are 38 percent. That's an average of 43 percent to 44
percent which is far above the overall average of about 30 percent
to 31 percent.''
   The government, utilities and other private industries are
sharing the cost of developing new ways of burning coal so the
plentiful fuel can provide more power with less pollution.
   Gasses from coal-burning power plants help cause both acid rain
and the greenhouse effect, or overall warming of the globe.

   A used car dealer and a federal employee who
handled Oliver North's expenses were being brought in as witnesses
to shore up the prosecution claim that North misspent profits from
arms sales to Iran.
   The witnesses were summoned to rebut testimony North gave during
his six days on the witness stand in U.S. District Court. The last
of those six days was Thursday, when the defense rested its case.
   The suburban Washington used car dealer sold North a heavy duty
station wagon in 1985 for $8,038. Under cross-examination from
prosecutor John Keker, North said he helped pay for the GMC
Suburban out of a $15,000 fund he kept in a metal box bolted to a
closet floor at his house.
   North paid off the $3,038 balance on the $8,038 vehicle four
days after making the down payment. Keker asked North whether he
got $3,000 in cash that day from Richard Secord, whose office is a
mile or two from the car lot in Virginia.
   North said he got ``a lot of money from Gen. Secord on a lot of
occasions'' and didn't remember that particular day.
   North had enlisted Secord to run arms secretly to the Contras,
and North replenished a fund kept in an office safe with $150,000
to $200,000 in cash from Secord, a co-defendant in the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The prosecution is calling the former National Security Council
employee who reimbursed some of North's travel expenses, to
reinforce the charge that North converted to his own use $4,300 in
travelers checks from Contra leader Adolfo Calero.
   North maintains he used the checks to reimburse himself for
out-of-pocket costs. In question are more than $2,000 in expenses
for which North sought reimbursement from the government after
paying for business trips with travelers checks.
   Calero gave North travelers checks to help the Contras and the
Iran arms initiative and over time, $90,000 to $100,000 from Calero
was funneled through North's office safe.
   As North's criminal trial draws to a close, his lawyers are
trying to introduce evidence showing that in all his actions, North
was only doing the bidding of top administration officials.
   One document shows that North and CIA director William Casey met
at least 26 times and talked by phone on at least 157 occasions
from Jan. 3, 1984, through Nov. 24, 1986.
   The defense also wants to introduce a document showing that
national security adviser Robert McFarlane was completely in charge
of responding to a series of questions on North's Contra
activities. North is now accused of making false statements in
connection with those responses, which denied he was helping the
rebels.
   The document is a computer note saying that McFarlane received
congressional letters and ``he finally sent them to Ollie and asked
for draft letters. ... McFarlane made himself the action officer on
this. ... and I think this is one issue he wants to do his way.''
The computer note was written by the NSC's legal counsel.
   North faces 12 charges, including lying to Congress and
obstructing a presidential inquiry.

   President Bush is weighing a visit to Poland
and Hungary in July as opportunity beckons for the United States to
promote political reform and capitalism in Eastern Europe.
   The two countries are at the head of the pack, Poland in
recognizing the trade union movement Solidarity, Hungary in raising
living standards and even permitting a stock exchange to operate.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a speech last month in
Vienna, called on the Soviet Union to scrap the Brezhnev Doctrine.
That is the principle that Moscow has the right to dispatch the Red
Army to protect an endangered Communist government in any East
European country.
   Baker's speech shows the Bush administration is not sure Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is willing to accept radical change
in Eastern Europe. The Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and
Czechoslovakia in 1968 were on Baker's mind.
   But times and the Soviet leadership have changed. Gorbachev is
determined to improve political and economic conditions at home. He
may want to encourage similar reforms among the East European
allies.
   Baker, who is starting to feel his way in foreign policy, was
impressed by the reports of reform he received in Vienna from the
foreign ministers of Poland and Hungary. The pace in Poland has
picked up since, and Bush is preparing to announce on Monday a
major program of economic benefits.
   Looking for opportunities to make a difference, the president
and the secretary of state hope to encourage further cautious
applications of American capitalism and Western-styled democracy in
Eastern Europe.
   It is a policy that is bound to play well in the United States.
   One of every eight Americans has roots in Central and Eastern
Europe. In many cases, the ethnic and cultural affinity is strong
after the passage of two or three generations. Conservatives
especially would like to ``liberate'' Eastern Europe from what they
call the Soviet empire.
   Symbols are important. A Bush trip after his summit meeting in
July with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and
West Germany could enhance his political standing at home while
emboldening the East Europeans.
   President Nixon visited Poland and Romania. President Carter
went to Poland. Otherwise, U.S. presidents have not been to the six
countries _ Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania
and Bulgaria _ allied to the Soviet Union since World War II.
   The trick in considering high-level political visits is to
arrange them in a way that encourages change instead of appearing
to endorse the local government.
   Mark Palmer, the U.S. ambassador to Hungary, suggests one way is
to be sure to meet with church and opposition figures as well as
the party leadership. That is what former Secretary of State George
P. Shultz did in the Ukraine and in Soviet Georgia.
   ``The peoples of Eastern and Central Europe want the kind of
political institutions taken for granted in the West,'' Palmer
wrote in a recent East-West Forum publication. ``Eastern Europeans
want newspapers that print news, not propaganda; trade unions that
represent workers, not a single political party; universities that
are free to develop ideas and innovation; and governments elected
by the people.''
   The American diplomat suggested a presidential visit to all six
countries. He said the United States is probably more popular in
Eastern and Central Europe than in any other part of the world.
   But, Palmer wrote: ``It is up to the peoples of the region to
insist upon progress toward pluralism and openness.''
   The United States and other Western countries, the U.S.
ambassador said, can play a broad and important secondary role with
diplomatic exchanges and clever private initiatives.
   Among Palmer`s suggestions:
   _Credits, from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and other institutions, that are tied to specific reforms,
including sharp cutbacks in the role of ministries, the Communist
party and the government in the East European economies.
   _Western investments that encourage a diversification of
manufacturing and a greater emphasis on consumer goods,
agricultural commodities and tourism.
   _Expanded contact between Western and Eastern political parties
and trade unions.
   _Sending 1,000 English teachers a year to high schools in
Central and Eastern Europe and admitting 2,000 students from there
to study annually in the West.
   ``It is time,'' Palmer said, `'for the West to perceive this
region as a new frontier, one in which a new level of effort and
perseverance will yield substantial results in the long term.''

   A CIA officer publicly condemned former White
House aide Oliver North for his actions during the Iran-Contra
affair, but the agency says he was not espousing an official CIA
position.
   ``The agency doesn't comment on a current matters in
litigation,'' said CIA spokesman Bill Devine.
   CIA officer Arthur S. Hulnick, speaking at American University
on Tuesday, condemned North's actions and said the covert operation
should have been handled by the CIA.
   ``You shouldn't use a bunch of amateurs to try to carry out a
covert action when they don't know what they're doing and that you
shouldn't use guys at the National Security Council staff _ willing
though they may be _ because as Ollie North admitted the other day,
he wasn't trained for it and we are,'' Hulnick said.
   Following his speech, in remarks to an Associated Press
reporter, Hulnick compared North's defense _ that he was just
following orders _ to the defense used by Nazi war criminals at the
Nuremberg trials.
   ``I thought we settled this 40 years ago,'' he said.
   Hulnick said North's defense is also the same one used by Army
Lt. William Calley, which didn't wash when the Vietnam War officer
said he had massacred civilians at My Lai because he was following
orders.
   Devine said Hulnick is a full-time agency officer and the CIA's
coordinator for academic affairs, but Hulnick is ``not exactly in
the loop'' regarding the Iran-Contra affair. Devine would neither
confirm nor deny if Hulnick is an active case officer.
   ``He's a man with a long career in the agency,'' DeVine said.
   During his speech, Hulnick said the Reagan administration's
Iran-Contra program was ``bad policy, badly carried out. We've
learned a lesson from that.''
   Hulnick said such covert actions in the Bush administration
would likely be carried out by CIA, not the NSC.
   ``There's an interesting signal being sent,'' Hulnick said.
``When the Bush administration came into office they selected an
officer to serve as intelligence manager in the National Security
Council staff who is not a covert action guy, in fact he's not even
an agency (CIA) officer.''
   The appointee is Bill Working, the NSC's senior director for
intelligence programs.
   ``He's a former Air Force officer whose job on the intelligence
community staff was to deal with the budget and management. What
this tells me is that the administration is going to be more
interested in long-term planning to deal with things like the START
treaty rather than in covert action of some kind or another,''
Hulnick said.

   Governors can encourage more international
trade by businesses within their states and should appoint
top-level ``trade czars'' to give exports a higher priority, a
group of the nation's governors said today.
   The National Governors' Association's task force on foreign
markets said in a report that states must develop new links with
foreign countries if their citizens are to succeed in a future
economy that will be increasingly dependent on international trade.
   ``While the federal government sets the rules on trade, success
in developing and expanding foreign markets depends on the
decisions of thousands of corporations and business people,'' said
Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, a Democrat and chairman of the
governors' association. ``State governments are positioned to
help.''
   The task force of governors, which included unsuccessful
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, the three-term
governor of Massachusetts, was releasing the report at a news
conference today.
   The governors have made international trade a focus of their
gatherings this year. In February the governors' association
released a report calling on states to require more international
instruction in public schools and to offer foreign languages to
students as early as the first grade.
   The report said each state should come up with its own realistic
and innovative plan for finding new markets and developing new
products that will be in demand by foreign nations. Governors can
elevate foreign trade to a top priority and increase public
awareness of the connections between their own economy and
international markets, it said.
   ``We can do something about international competition,'' Baliles
said. ``We can develop an export culture. We can develop programs
that identify markets.''
   The report suggested governors appoint a ``trade czar,'' an
official with state cabinet-level rank who would direct and
coordinate the state plan for encouraging international trade.
   It said state governments should help firms obtain financing for
export deals, either through direct loans and loan-guarantee
programs, or by serving as brokers and clearinghouses to match
commercial lenders with businesses.
   The report recommended groups of states consider pooling
resources for trade and tourism promotion and strengthen cultural
exchanges with foreign countries.
   States and governors have looked for ways to increase
international trade in recent years, and many governors have gone
on foreign trips to promote trade.
   The report cited recent successes in new markets, such as the
sale of Mississippi catfish to the Soviet Union. It said Virginia
chicken processors have begun exporting chicken feet, once
discarded as waste, to the Far East, where they are considered a
delicacy.
   ``Business as usual is just not enough,'' the report said. ``As
the world gets smaller, state initiatives must become more
far-reaching.''

   The ruling Sandinista party says it
will build up its defenses in response to Congress' decision to
give $50 million in humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front on Thursday issued a
statement after the Senate vote, saying its members ``repudiate the
approval of these new funds by the U.S. Congress for the mercenary
forces.''
   Both houses voted overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of the new
aid.
   ``This has violated one more time the rights and the order of
international justice and makes fun of the will of the Central
American presidents, as expressed in the document of Costa del Sol,
El Salvador, on Feb. 14,'' the Sandinista party said.
   The statement referred to an agreement by the presidents of El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Honduras to come up
with a plan by mid-May to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel force
known as the Contras.
   The statement, signed by the Front's nine commanders, called the
humanitarian aid package ``threats by the U.S. government to apply
new forms of force'' against the leftist Nicaraguan government.
   The Sandinista party said it would ``build up its military
defense plans, taking into account that the war is not over,
despite advances reached in the deepening strategic defeat of the
mercenary forces.''
   It also called the Contras ``an instrument of Yankee imperialist
aggression.''
   An estimated 11,000 Contra rebels have lived with their families
in Honduran border camps since Congress cut off military aid in
February 1988.

<HEAD>Bush S&amp;L Plan Clears Early Hurdles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After clearing its first two hurdles
relatively intact, President Bush's $90 billion plan to bail out
and reform the savings and loan industry is gaining momentum in
Congress.
   The package survived its biggest challenge so far on Thursday
when congressional Democrats capitulated to Bush's financing
scheme, which is designed to keep the $50 billion taxpayer cost
from showing up in the federal deficit.
   The House Banking Committee's financial institutions
subcommittee, a legislative safehouse for the savings industry in
the past, approved the overall plan after amending it to let S&amp;L
owners put up less money to stay in business than Bush had wanted.
   A day earlier, the Senate Banking Committee approved the package
after also weakening, but to a lesser degree, the capital standards
that thrifts must meet in the future to qualify for federal deposit
insurance.
   The federal S&amp;L insurance fund is now more than $25 billion in
the hole because of loans that turned sour and, in many cases,
fraudulent lending and accounting practices using
government-insured deposits.
   Another $50 billion in uncovered loan losses loom just over the
horizon for 350 more insolvent thrift institutions that the
government is keeping open now only because it doesn't have the
money to close or merge them.
   The full Senate plans to take up the bill Monday with the aim of
passing it Wednesday before recessing for Passover. In the House,
the bill now goes to the full Banking Committee, where Bush may win
back some of the tougher capital and regulatory requirements he
lost in the subcommittee.
   ``The Senate gave Bush about 80 to 85 percent of what he wants
and we gave him 60 to 65 percent,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., a subcommittee member who was on the losing side of a 24-23
vote to cut Bush's proposed capital requirements.
   ``By the time it's all over, he may get 90 to 95 percent of what
he wants,'' Schumer said, referring to the $6 that S&amp;L owners would
have to have in capital for every $100 they lend _ the same level
now required of banks.
   The subcommittee, on an amendment by its chairman, Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., and Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., voted to keep the
present requirement _ $3 in capital for every $100 of lending.
   But it also tightened the standards in one significant way by
saying at least half that amount, or $1.50 for each $100 in loans,
must be in ``tangible'' assets or real money that the owners could
lose.
   The administration and congressional auditors have blamed part
of the S&amp;L crisis on ``smoke and mirrors'' accounting practices
that Congress and regulators authorized, allowing thrifts to count
non-cash items such as good will and deferred loan losses as
capital.
   The administration is still unhappy with House and Senate
provisions that would permit capital-deficient thrifts to continue
growing. Under its proposal, capital-weak institutions would have
been required to shrink their operations or merge with a healthier
partner.
   ``It's really building the skyscraper on quicksand,'' said L.
William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
which under the bill will have expanded responsibility to insure
deposits in S&amp;Ls as well as commercial banks.
   The House panel also voted to increase from $50 million to $75
million the amount Bush had requested for the Justice Department to
pursue criminal fraud and conspiracy charges against S&amp;L executives
who loaned or invested deposits illegally.
   And it amended Bush's plan to allow banks to begin buying up
both insolvent and healthy thrift institutions immediately. In
deference to small banks and the thrift industry, Bush had proposed
allowing banks to buy only ailing S&amp;Ls for the next two years and
healthy ones as well after that.
   ``The one question we are repeatedly asked is what are we doing
to bring more capital into a capital-deficit industry,'' said Rep.
Doug Barnard, D-Ga. ``This is the one thing we can do.''
   Opponents, however, fear that change will increase taxpayer
costs because banks will buy only healthy S&amp;Ls, leaving the
government stuck to pick up all the losses of the insolvent ones.
   While the banks won that issue, they lost another one to the
insurance industry. The subcommittee voted to declare a 2{-year
moratorium on allowing more than $100,000 of multimillion-dollar
bank investment certificates to be covered by federal insurance.
   In the past two years, banks have started using the certificates
offering fixed interest rates to lure pension plan funds away from
insurance companies, which have no federal deposit insurance.
   The real estate industry also won a major victory in both House
and Senate versions through amendments that would require state
licensing of appraisers. That legislation had been stalled for
years out of fears that real estate brokers would use it to
monopolize and sharply increase appraisal fees.

<HEAD>Government Will Want Average Worker's Earnings Through May 4</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once the Monday deadline for filing 1988
federal income-tax returns passes, the average worker still will
have to toil an additional 17 days before having earned what
government tax collectors will demand for 1989.
   ``Tax Freedom Day'' arrives this year on May 4. It has not been
later since the Tax Foundation began calculating this measure of
the burden imposed on workers by federal, state and local
governments. It was Feb. 13 in 1930.
   By the foundation's calculations, the average worker will work
124 days this year just to pay taxes. So, if the government
demanded its money up front, it would take all of the average
worker's income through May 4.
   That is the same as the last two years _ in fact, it is the same
as in 1981, when Congress and President Reagan agreed on the
biggest tax cut in the nation's history.
   ``Americans ... are not better off than they were in 1981,
despite economic growth, cuts in income tax rates and repeated
claims that government spending has been cut to the bone,'' the
foundation said Thursday in announcing Tax Freedom Day.
   The reasons: 13 federal tax increases enacted since 1981; the
giant 1986 tax overhaul, which, to millions of taxpayers, took away
more than it gave; Social Security taxes that have been growing
more rapidly than the economy, and steady state and local tax
increases caused in part by a reduction in federal aid.
   If you prefer worrying about your taxes on the installment plan,
the foundation offers this option: The average worker will put in 1
hour and 46 minutes each 8-hour day this year to pay federal taxes
and another 56 minutes for state and local taxes. The federal take
is down by a minute from 1988; the state-local burden is unchanged.
   The foundation, a Washington-based research organization,
assumes for the purposes of its calculation that all taxes are paid
by individuals, including those collected from corporations.
   As the foundation offered its unique look at the tax system,
there were these developments:
   _The Internal Revenue Service geared up for the last three work
days of the 1988 return-filing season, promising its toll-free
telephone system will be open to answer questions Saturday morning
and until 7 p.m. local time Monday. IRS offices offering advice to
walk-in taxpayers plan extended hours on Monday.
   The IRS earlier projected that 32 million couples and
individuals (out of 109 million expected to file sometime this
year) would wait until the final two weeks of the season.
   The deadline this year is Monday midnight because the statutory
deadline, April 15, falls on a Saturday. Because Monday is a
holiday, Patriots' Day, in Massachusetts, where one of the IRS's 10
service centers is located, filers in New England and most of New
York state have until midnight Tuesday.
   _Groups opposed to current levels of military spending prepared
to demonstrate in more than 50 cities in a protest dubbed ``Build
Homes Not Bombs Tax Day Actions.'' The actions range from urging
late filers at the Post Office in Milwaukee to attach protest
stamps to IRS envelopes, to construction of a cardboard ``tax
shelter'' in Santa Rosa, Calif.
   _The Coalition Against Regressive Taxation, composed of special
interests fighting any rise in excise taxes to fight the federal
deficit, released a study indicating that over the past 10 years
the share of all federal taxes falling on the poor has risen by 12
percent while the burden on upper-income Americans has dropped by
4.3 percent. The group says this would be worsened by higher taxes
on gasoline, alcohol or tobacco.
   The 50 percent of taxpayers considered to have middle income _
between $20,000 and $60,000 _ saw a 3.4 percent rise in their share
of the burden. Those with incomes under $20,000 constitute
about-one-third of the population; those over $60,000, about
one-sixth.

   Organizers of a convention of newspaper

into each other, said James Squires, editor of the Chicago Tribune
and one of the organizers of the annual meeting.
   Ambassador Moshe Arad said Squires had failed to inform him
until this week of the invitation extended to the PLO ``and an
attempt to put them on the same platform in direct sequence to each
other reflected an attempt to embarrass us.''
   Arad said he ``could not imagine'' that Squires had not known
Shaath would appear so closely following Shamir. ``Still you
preferred to withhold this information,'' he said. ``I find the
entire handling of the invitation most inappropriate and
unethical.''
   Squires insisted that Arad ``was given no misleading
information'' about the speaking engagements, saying ``it's
ridiculous for them to dictate to us how we run our meeting.''
   ``It's none of Mr. Arad's business who we choose to invite to
the ASNE meeting,'' Squires said. ``It's exactly the kind of
absurdity that this Middle East conflict is producing.''

<HEAD>Exxon Making Oil Spill Down Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Exxon Corp. is releasing a $15 million
down payment for the Alaska oil spill in an agreement announced one
day after Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan publicly complained about
delays.
   ``I am pleased that Exxon has acknowledged its long-term
responsibility to provide not only for the cleanup but for the
far-reaching effects (of the spill),'' Lujan said Thursday when the
agreement was announced.
   The ``up front'' money is to help assess the environmental
damage caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill and plan for a recovery.
   On Wednesday, Lujan had complained that Exxon was not moving as
fast as he would like in providing the money. He said government
and Exxon attorneys had been negotiating for 10 days without an
agreement.
   But the department announced late Thursday that the oil company
had earlier in the day agreed on procedures for transferring the
$15 million to the government, with about half of that immediately
to be distributed to four federal agencies already working in
Alaska.
   The government has said it wants the $15 million in advance so
authorities, including the state of Alaska, can develop a long-term
recovery plan and assess the extent of damage along Alaska's
southern coast to wildlife, waterfowl, fish and public lands.
   Lujan has said that eventually these costs, separate from the
direct cleanup costs, are likely to be ``in the tens of millions''
of dollars.
   Lujan said he considers the money ``an initial step'' in Exxon
paying for the environmental damages caused by one of its tankers
when the vessel ran aground in Prince William Sound, spilling more
than 10 million gallons of oil into the pristine waters.
   Exxon spokesmen said in response to Lujan's complaints that they
were perplexed by his remarks. The spokesmen said the oil company
all along has been willing to provide the money, although
procedures had to be worked out.

<HEAD>Wright's Statement Defending Himself Against Ethics Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Wright Probe Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from House Speaker Jim
Wright's statement Thursday as he defended himself against ethics
charges.
   It appears from news accounts that the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct has made a decision that there may be some reason
to believe that I, in my personal business dealings, could have
violated some rules of the House. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I have asked the committee for the opportunity to appear ... to
answer every question they may wish to ask, and to demonstrate that
there is clear and convincing proof that I have not violated those
rules of the House.
   I am confident that in the 34 years I've served in the Congress,
I have not violated any of those basic rules nor any commonly
accepted standard of ethical conduct. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I think I am the most fortunate of men to have been privileged
to serve in this institution.
   And certainly under no circumstances would I knowingly or
intentionally violate any of its rules.
   And I am convinced that I can demonstrate that to the
satisfaction of the committee or of any other reasonable person. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I'm not accused of any personal immorality or of any dishonesty
or of misusing tax dollars.
   We're dealing here with three issues concerning my personal
finances and the technical reporting requirements of the Congress.
...
   ... Questions concern whether my wife's employment, at a salary
of $18,000 a year, for a small corporation in which we provided
half the capitalization and owned half the stock, was truly and
properly employment, or whether it was some concealed gift.
   The second question involves whether or not my business partner,
George Mallick, had a direct interest in legislation, as defined
under the rules of the House.
   And the third question involves whether royalties that I
received from a book that I wrote were properly received as
royalties, or whether they actually should have been reported in
some other way as a gift or an honorarium.
   I am prepared to demonstrate that in each of these instances, no
rule has been violated. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I must say that I do find that personally offensive, for anyone
to suggest that my wife, Betty, did not perform services worth
$18,000.
   It is quite interesting to observe, I believe, that both before
and after the few years that she worked for our small investment
corporation, Betty made considerably more money than the $18,000 a
year that she accepted from the corporation for serving it in many,
many capacities. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Those who are married to people in public office, in the
Congress, are entitled to lives of their own.
   Perhaps half of the wives of members of Congress, spouses of
members of Congress, are engaged or employed in a professional or
business relationship on their own. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I want to say to you that my wife is a good, decent, caring,
thoroughly honorable person.
   I'll damned well fight to protect her honor and her integrity
against any challenge by any source, whatever the cost. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I've known Mr. Mallick and he's been a personal friend of mine
for the better part of 30 years _ more than a quarter of a century.
   In all the years that I've known him, he has never once asked me
to intercede in his behalf with any branch of government, any
agency of government, to do anything for him personally in my
official capacity.
   Not one time has he ever asked me to vote for or against any
piece of legislation, any provision of law, any amendment.
   It just never has happened _ not one single time. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I have not received gifts of the type forbidden from Mr. Mallick.
   And even if I had, they would not be forbidden, because he has
never had a special interest in legislation. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Now, the third question involves the publishing of books that I
wrote _ a little book called ``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   I have written other books that have been published and I got
advance payments for the other books and relatively smaller
royalties.
   But the rules of the House do not stipulate what size royalty
you should get.
   The rules clearly exempt royalty income from books from the
outside earning limitations that are imposed. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I've abided by the rules.
   I have been interested in a widespread distribution of the book,
yes.
   I want people to buy the book, yes. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It has been suggested that because one or more organizations to
which I had made a speech had seen fit to purchase copies of the
book, distribute them among their members, or students or others,
that therefore, I was trying to avoid the outside earning
limitations imposed on honoraria, and actually was receiving a
honorarium for the speech.
   Well, that was never my intention.
   I never asked anybody to buy books in exchange for my making a
speech. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I've reported my wife's source of income, I've reported every
penny of income that I made from the sale of the books and from the
corporation in which we own half interest.
   The question involves whether I should have reported them in one
column or in another column.
   And I believe I reported them in the right column. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I am 66 years of age.
   Sixty-six years of living and giving, striving and sometimes
failing, and sometimes succeeding, treating my fellow man with
decency, and dignity, and respect, I believe have earned me a
reputation as a person of decency, and as a person of honor, and as
a person of integrity.
   I know that my wife deserves to be known in that way, and that,
to me, is the most important thing, and the only really important
thing, and for my good name which is the legacy I intend to leave
my children and my grandchildren.
   I will fight to the last ounce of conviction and energy that I
possess.

<HEAD>Testing Recommended For TB, AIDS Patients To Combat Link</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spread of AIDS-virus infections in the United
States could trigger dramatic increases in tuberculosis cases,
according to federal health officials.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, responding to an
increasing link between AIDS and tuberculosis, urged doctors
Thursday to give TB tests to patients infected with the AIDS virus
and to make AIDS testing available to TB patients.
   The number of the nation's 20,000 annual tuberculosis patients
who are also infected with the AIDS virus is unknown. But one study
cited by the CDC, matching reported TB cases with AIDS cases in 43
states, found that 4 percent of AIDS patients also were listed as
TB patients.
   The CDC also reported Thursday that the focus of AIDS in the
United States is shifting away from the Northeast as more and more
cases are showing up in smaller cities.
   Only 32 percent of the nation's AIDS cases in 1988 were reported
from New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, compared with 54
percent four years earlier.
   ``It's moving outside of the major metropolitan areas, and
outside the Northeast,'' said CDC AIDS specialist Dr. Jeannette
Stehr-Green, noting that the proportion of cases in urban areas
under 500,000 population increased from 12 percent in pre-1986
years to 19 percent in 1988.
   Tuberculosis is one of a number of ``opportunistic infections''
which can prey on the weakened immune systems of AIDS patients, and
can serve as an early indicator of the disease.
   But ``tuberculosis is one of the few infections associated with
HIV that's transmissible by the airborne route _ so there are
public health implications here,'' said Dr. Carol A. Ciesielski, a
CDC tuberculosis specialist.
   The CDC, in a report from its Advisory Committee for the
Elimination of Tuberculosis, said all patients diagnosed with
tuberculosis should be offered AIDS testing and counseling.
Likewise, AIDS-infected persons should be given tuberculosis tests.
   The reason, Ciesielski said, is that TB, unlike many infections
that can plague AIDS patients, ``is curable and preventable. By ...
testing early, you can give them medicine to prevent them
developing it, preventing a new case from occurring.''
   Tuberculosis, a bacterial infection of the lungs, can be cured
or prevented in most cases with drugs. Studies have suggested that
a latent infection with TB bacteria ``may often progress to
clinical TB'' early in the course of a person's infection with the
AIDS virus, the CDC said.
   In some areas, the link between TB and AIDS can be high. A
Florida study found that 10 percent of AIDS patients were also TB
patients; a study at a New Jersey hospital found a connection in 21
percent, the CDC said.
   Minority populations, in some high-AIDS areas, ``have been at
particular risk'' of AIDS-associated TB, the CDC said. Studies in
New York City, Florida and Newark, N.J., found that blacks and
Hispanics accounted for more than 80 percent of the TB-AIDS cases.
   In its report Thursday on the eight years since AIDS was first
reported, the CDC said the rate of increase in the number of
documented AIDS cases has declined.
   The number of AIDS cases, as compared with the year before, shot
up 215 percent between 1982 and 1983. Since then, the increase has
slowed: up 117 percent in 1984, 84 percent in 1985, 60 percent in
1986, 60 percent again in 1987 and 34 percent last year, when
32,311 cases were reported, said Stehr-Green, chief of the CDC's
AIDS reporting and analysis section.
   In the latest monthly count from the CDC, the nation has
reported 90,990 AIDS cases. And 52,435 of those patients, or 58
percent, have died.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar lost ground against the Japanese
yen Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
moderately rebounded in the afternoon session despite losses in
early trading.
   The dollar closed at 132.45 yen, down 0.35 yen from Thursday's
132.80-yen finish. The currency opened at 132.00 yen and fluctuated
in a range of 131.92 yen to 132.53 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
192.51 points Thursday, regained 86.50 points, or 0.26 percent, to
finish the week's trading at 33,150.44 points.
   Although the index shed 138.67 points by the end of the morning
session, it gained ground in the afternoon.
   Dealers said the market's main index recovered as institutional
investors started to pick up cheaper issues.
   In the currency market, traders said the dollar fell in Tokyo
after slipping in New York to 132.06 yen, down 0.99 yen from its
133.05 yen close on Wednesday.
   The U.S. currency weakened in overseas dealings after a rise in
Swiss interest rates and the appointment of a new West German
finance minister, the traders said.
   Nervousness over U.S. trade figures was also discouraging
trading in the foreign exchange market, a dealer at a Japanese
commercial bank said on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Frees Former President Convicted In Coup Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court today threw out the
convictions of former President Sokomanu and three politicians who
were accused of trying to overthrow the elected government of this
South Pacific island chain.
   The official Radio Vanuatu said the Vanautu Court of Appeals'
ruling was greeted with wild celebrations in Port Vila, the capital.
   The court ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict
Sokomanu, his nephew Barak Sope and two other politicians allegedly
involved in the coup attempt.
   On March 7, Sokomanu was sentenced to six years in prison, Sope
and opposition leader Maxime Carolot were sentenced to five years
and former member of Parliament Willie Jimmy was sentenced to two
years.
   Sokomanu was accused of inciting mutiny within Vanuatu's
paramilitary forces in December in an attempt to replace the
elected government of Prime Minister Walter Lini with an interim
administration headed by Sope.
   Sokomanu, who had been president since 1980, was dismissed from
office in January by the Electoral College, which accused him of
gross misconduct.
   Sokomanu and the other defendants were arrested in late
December. At the time of his arrest, Sokamanu acknowledged that his
action was unconstitutional but said Lini was unable to govern
after suffering a stroke.
   Sope, a minister for transport, tourism and public works, had
been engaged in a power struggle with Lini for more than a year.
   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, had been
jointly administered by Britain and France since 1906 until it was
granted independence in 1980. Vanuatu, about 1,200 miles northeast
of Sydney, Australia, has a population of about 130,000.

   A private environmental group charges that
Japan is speeding the destruction of tropical rain forest in
southeast Asia because of its demand for timber.
   ``Tropical forests are being destroyed, for ineffective plywood
uses and even disposable chopsticks,'' said Robert Buschbacher,
director of the World Wildlife Fund's forestry program.
   ``As forests are eradicated in Asia, Japan will look towards
South America _ specifically the Amazon _ to exploit,'' Buschbacher
said in a statement released with the report on Thursday.
   The report, entitled ``Timber from the South Seas,'' said that
in 1987 Japan got 96 percent of its tropical hardwoods from Sarawak
and Sabah in Malaysia, and from Papua New Guinea. A statement by
the fund said some of the world's most biologically valuable
forests are threatened with destruction in Sabah and Sarawak, on
the island of Borneo.

<TEXT>
   The government is seeking $1.4 million in
fines from an Illinois manufacturer of catalytic converter
replacement pipes that the Environmental Protection Agency charges
are ineffective.
   A formal complaint was filed by the Justice Department on behalf
of the EPA in federal court in Chicago against Ced's Inc., of
Addison, Ill., the EPA said Thursday.
   The EPA accused the company, which also does business as
Products for Power, of failing to abide by a 1987 settlement
agreement in which the company allegedly said it would pay $75,000
in fines and stop selling the replacement pipes.
   The pipes, rather than helping automobile performance, ``are
merely lengths of plain exhaust tubing cut to fit in place of
catalytic converters and offer no performance advantages over
properly functioning catalytic converters,'' said the EPA.

<TEXT>
   A suspected member of a drug-smuggling
cult was forced to dig up the remains of the 13th victim of revenge
and sacrificial killings as public officials decried the
``massacre.''
   Authorities are looking for the sect's alleged ringleader,
Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whom members called ``godfather.'' The
five men in custody said Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24,
called the ``witch,'' believed human sacrifices protected the cult
from harm.
   Cameron County Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito in Texas said that
Constanzo, a Cuban who has contacts in Miami, was last seen in
Brownsville.
   In Matamoros, City Council members and civic leaders issued a
``Declaration Against Drug Trafficking'' on Thursday that said,
``Those connected to the massacre who poisoned the public should be
prosecuted.''
   State Attorney General Anibal Perez Vargas talked with Matamoros
authorities, then said, ``We will not rest until we uncover all the
vermin that use legal activities as a front to break the law.''
   Using a pick and shovel and his hands, Sergio Martinez, 22, dug
alone for more than an hour Thursday afternoon to uncover the body
on the ranch near Matamoros, where authorities unearthed a dozen
bodies Tuesday, including that of University of Texas student Mark
Kilroy.
   Martinez turned to police at one point and asked to be allowed
to rest and then asked for a tractor to dig the hole. ``Come on,
use your hands,'' policemen yelled at him.
   The 13th victim, about 30 years old, had a rectangular cut over
the left side of his chest, which showed signs that his heart had
been ripped from his body, authorities said.
   Federal Judicial Police commander Juan Benitez Ayala said they
fear there are more bodies to be found.
   One investigator said some blood-stained children's clothing has
been found at Ms. Aldrete's house, but they have received no
reports of missing children.
   Helen Kilroy, the mother of Mark Kilroy, asked 1,200 people at a
Mass in Brownsville on Thursday to pray for the dead and the men
who killed them.
   ``Pray for the people who have done these things,'' Mrs. Kilroy
said at St. Luke's Catholic Churh. ``Pray that they are caught and
that the Lord will enter their hearts, and they will know what they
have done is wrong.''
   In a dramatic public confession Wednesday, some of the five men
in custody were paraded onto a balcony where they told reporters
the slayings were intended to provide a ``magical shield'' for
members of a drug-smuggling ring.
   A cauldron with a turtle, brains and other items were found near
the graves at the ranch along with bowls containing burned goats'
heads and a mutilated rooster.
   So far, the only victim to be publicly identified was Kilroy,
who was abducted from the streets of Matamoros last month during
spring break.
   The search for Constanzo has been focused on the Miami area,
where his family lived in a middle-class neighborhood in the late
1970s and early 1980s, authorities said.
   Those who know Ms. Aldrete say her alleged ties to the sect have
taken them by surprise.
   ``Apparently, Sara was leading a double life: as a witch in
Mexico and as a dean's honor roll student at Texas Southmost
College,'' said Cameron County Sheriff's Deputy Carlos Tapia in
Texas.
   Texas Southmost College is a two-year college in Brownsville
with an enrollment of 6,500.
   A search of her home in Matamoros revealed an altar and
blood-spatters, but no bones or bodies, Gavito said.
   The bodies of the victims were at funeral homes pending
identification, authorities said.
   Officials said the sect was shipping more than a ton of
marijuana to the United States each week, and that U.S.
investigators are helping Mexican authorities in the investigation.

   The major bribery scandal shaking the Japanese
government widened further today as the country's second most
powerful leader admitted his wife was paid about $60,000 by Recruit
Co.
   Shintaro Abe, secretary general of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, acknowledged earlier news reports that Recruit
Co. paid his wife, Yoko, about $2,300 monthly as a consulting fee
from February 1986 to August 1988.
   ``I put my secretary entirely in charge of my fund-raising
affairs and neither my wife nor myself knew anything about it,''
said Abe in a news conference this morning. ``But I have found such
a deal took place and I admit it was a result of my ignorance.''
   Abe refused to give any further details. He said the fees
totaling about $60,000 were deposited into a bank account of his
secretary, who has been sick and hospitalized.
   Abe, the second most powerful Liberal Democrat after Takeshita,
was foreign minister and secretary general of the party when his
wife was paid the money. His disclosure followed statements by
Takeshita in Parliament Tuesday that he received about $1 million
from Recruit, an information services conglomerate.
   Both Abe and Takeshita are among 17 politicians and about 150
other influential people known to have bought at discount prices
hundreds of thousands of unlisted shares in a subsidiary of Recruit
_ transactions that generated substantial profits when the share
price soared after over-the-counter trading began.
   The stock transactions were not considered illegal, but Recruit
also paid hundreds of millions of yen to dozens of influential
politicians as political contributions, raising suspicions that it
was seeking favors in return.
   So far, 14 people, including two former vice ministers and an
ex-chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Hisashi
Shinto, have been arrested on charges of bribery and securities law
violations in connection with the affair, and three Cabinet
ministers, including former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, have
been forced to resign due to their links to the scandal.
   Today's disclosure showed Abe continued to receive funds from
Recruit even after the scandal surfaced last summer and
contradicted a declaration by the Liberal Democratic Party earlier
this year that no members of the current Takeshita administration
received donations from Recruit after last summer.
   Opposition parties, which are stalemating parliamentary debate
on the national budget for the fiscal year that began April 1,
quickly stepped up their criticism of Takeshita and his
administration.
   ``How can he not know about the deposits?'' said Yukihisa
Yoshida, a official of the Democratic Socialist Party, a major
opposition group. ``It is extremely serious that he was receiving
money even after the Recruit scandal surfaced.''
   Shun Ohide, a official of the Japan Socialist Party, the largest
opposition group, said: ``Abe has been reported to be closely
linked to Recruit and I think it (today's revelation) was only part
of it. After all these revelations, the Liberal Democratic Party
should resign.''
   Despite media surveys showing his public support rate has
dropped below 10 percent _ to 7.8 percent in a poll by the
nationwide television network TV-Asahi _ Takeshita has refused
calls for his resignation, vowing to carry out political reforms
and restore public trust in his administration.

   A man suspected of leading a cult that performed
human sacrifices on a Mexican ranch was exposed to secretive
Afro-Caribbean religions that ritually slaughter animals and rely
on magic.
   But a Santeria priest and others familiar with the practices of
Santeria, voodoo and other obscure religions likened the Mexican
drug-smuggling cult more to the mass suicide in Jonestown led by
Jim Jones.
   At least 13 bodies have been found this week in shallow graves
in Matamoros, Mexico. Suspects in the slayings have said they
killed at the demand of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whom they called
``godfather.''
   They said Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, called the
``witch,'' believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult
protection from harm and helped them in a drug-smuggling operation.
   Constanzo, a Cuban-American who grew up in suburban Miami, is
still being sought.
   ``He's had some sort of exposure to Santeria, I wouldn't deny
that, but I wouldn't say he's a Santeria priest,'' said Willie
Ramos of Miami, a Santeria high priest.
   Santeria is a largely underground religion that melded the
beliefs of slaves from present-day Nigeria with Hispanic culture in
the Caribbean and parts of South America.
   ``Let's compare it to Jonestown in the sense that the guy in
Jonestown was deranged and demented. He got all these people to
follow him to the extent that he got these people killed,'' Ramos
said.
   Human sacrifice has never been practiced ``in the approximately
400 years that the Afro-Caribbean cults have survived in the New
World,'' he said.
   Mercedes Sandoval, a professor at Miami-Dade Community College
who has studied Santeria for nearly 40 years, said religious
beliefs could not be blamed for the slayings.
   ``It was not the religion that got them into drugs. It was the
drug dealing that led them to try to get protection through
religion,'' Ms. Sandoval said.
   Dr. Charles Wetli, Dade County deputy chief medical examiner who
has studied the religions for a decade as part of his work, agreed
with Ms. Sandoval.
   ``The drug-smuggling activities and the homicides are totally
unrelated to the religion,'' Wetli said. ``If you're a drug
smuggler, you can pray to some of these gods to help you with your
drug smuggling.''
   Blood from Santeria animal sacrifices can form an alliance with
gods of nature and protect the believers, a reason offered by
Mexican authorities as a motive for the killings at the ranch
across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Ms. Sandoval said.
   Constanzo ``probably was seeking assistance from magical systems
to get protection, and then he himself developed his own ritual.''
   Ms. Sandoval estimated as many as 25,000 people in south Florida
are regular Santeria followers, and they also can be found in New
York, New Jersey, California, Venezuela, Colombia and Spain.
   Constanzo's family, which lived in a middle-class neighborhood
west of Miami until 1984, left headless chickens, geese and goats _
animals used in Santeria rituals _ on doorsteps and street corners,
said neighbors.
   Ms. Sandoval said symbols of Santeria were present in the farm
shack where investigators believe the victims were killed, but
television pictures also revealed human skulls commonly used in the
practice of palo mayombe.
   Palo mayombe, with origins in Congo, uses human skulls in its
rituals, but Ms. Sandoval and Wetli said they are obtained through
medical supply stores, from medical school students and, only
occasionally, through grave robbing.
   ``I think what we have here is a case of some very sociopathic
people ... that may have been exposed to Santeria or some other
magical system,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ``I think we are dealing with
a deranged person.''
   Former neighbors recalled the Constanzos as Santeria followers
and referred to Constanzo's mother as a witch.
   Norma Brito, who bought the Constanzo's house after a bank
foreclosed on it in 1984, said she found the remains of an altar
with candles, wax and fruit when she moved in.

   The ritualistic killings of at least
13 people in Matamoros and the recent slayings of 12 in this
U.S.-Mexican border town are linked only by drugs, not cults, an
authority said.
   Police this week were investigating the discovery of at least 13
bodies in shallow graves in Matamoros, just south of Brownsville,
Texas. Suspects in the slayings have said they killed at the demand
of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, whom they called ``godfather.'' They
said Constanzo, 26, and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, called the
``witch,'' believed human sacrifices gave the members of cult
protection from harm and helped them in a drug-smuggling operation.
   Earlier this month, authorities in Agua Prieta discovered the
bodies of three women and nine men in a blood-splattered well and a
lime-treated spectic tank on an abandoned ranch about 1,000 yards
from the U.S. border. Police said the killings were believed to be
drug related.
   ``There is a special motive involved in the Agua Prieta case
which has nothing to do with voodoo or witchcraft or religion or
satanism,'' Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said in Tucson,
Ariz., on Thursday. ``The mutilation of the bodies, in my judgment
_ the killings were torture killings as a result of retaliation, a
squabble amongst dopers.''
   Dupnik would not elaborate on the motive, ``but it has nothing
to do with cults or religion or satanism.''

<TEXT>
   Some countries now support the
Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia, a change that poses ``the
greatest danger to our nation,'' Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk said.
   A text of the prince's statement, seen today in Bangkok, was
made Wednesday during a Cambodian New Year's Day message over
resistance radio.
   Sihanouk leads a three-party guerrilla coalition fighting
Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in 1978 and installed an
allied government in Phnom Penh. Vietnam announced last week it
will withdraw its remaining 50,000 troops by Sept. 30 and asked
other countries to abide by pledges to stop aiding the guerrillas.
   The occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam has been, along with the
Soviet presence in Afghanistan, one of the major East-West issues.
   China had vowed not to improve relations with Moscow until the
Vietnamese left Cambodia. And Vietnam's own efforts to obtain aid
and recognition from the United States in the aftermath of the
Vietnam War were frustrated by Washington's insistence that Hanoi
withdraw its troops from Cambodia first.
   The prince previously has criticized Thailand, which gives
sanctuary to his guerrillas, for hosting Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen for an unprecedented visit to Thailand in January.
   Sihanouk's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, said recently that he
was saddened because Thailand and its allies in the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations have lessened their once-firm support for
key resistance proposals on ending the war.
   In the broadcast, Sihanouk said, ``Some foreigners, governments,
and some major newspapers of the Western world have currently
changed their attitude to wanting to embrace Vietnam's colonialism
and (the Heng Samrin government in Phnom Penh). This poses the
greatest danger to our nation.''
   These groups, the prince said, ``are doing what they can to make
us remain Vietnam's slaves all our lives.''
   Some governments and groups have been kept a distance from the
resistance because of Sihanouk's alliance in the guerrilla
coalition with the fanatical communist Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge
killed hundreds of thousands of people in Cambodia before Vietnam's
invasion toppled it. With 30,000-40,000 troops, it is the mightiest
of the guerrilla groups.
   Apparently in response to this, Sihanouk said, ``We do not need
to love the Khmer Rouge. However, if we do not fight within this
tripartite framework, it is impossible because we need to have
strength and unity among the three parties to fight the Vietnamese
enemies.''
   Sihanouk is to meet with Hun Sen, prime minister of the Phnom
Penh government, next month in Indonesia for their fourth round of
bilateral peace talks.
   In the broadcast, Sihanouk said he agreed to the meeting because
otherwise he would be accused of blocking the peace process and
because French government emissaries told him on March 26 that Hun
Sen had two concessions to make. The prince said he did not yet
know what these concessions were.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herbert Mills, part of the venerable Mills
Brothers group remembered for such hits as ``Paper Doll'' and
``Glow Worm,'' has died at the age of 77.
   Mills, who sang with the group for six decades, died Wednesday
at Valley Hospital.
   He performed with brothers Donald and Harry in a trio whose
harmonies weathered musical changes from the big band era through
rock 'n' roll.
   The original group quit performing after Harry's death in 1982,
although Donald and his son, John, continued as a duo using the
Mills Brothers name.
   Mills, a Las Vegas resident for more than 20 years, was born in
Piqua, Ohio on April 2, 1912. He began singing with his brothers
when he was 10 years old and by 1925, the Mills Brothers were
regulars on a Cincinnati radio show.
   The Mills Brothers became famous in 1943 with their hit ``Paper
Doll,'' soon followed by ``You Always Hurt the One You Love.''
Their string of hits continued into the 1950s with ``Daddy's Little
Girl'' and ``Glow Worm.''
   The fourth Mills Brother, John, died in 1936 and was replaced by
their father, John Sr., until 1957, when the group became a trio.
   Officials at Valley Hospital did not release the cause of death.
   Mills is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a daughter; his brother,
Donald; two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

   A citizens' group says it plans to challenge
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision permitting the
operator of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant to boil away 2.3
million gallons of radioactive water.
   Some of the water is left over from the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident, which occurred at the Middletown, Pa.,
plant on March 28, 1979.
   In a 5-0 vote, the commission on Thursday upheld a February
decision of its Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, which concluded
that the evaporation plan ``will have extremely small radiation
exposure consequences, both to workers and the general public.''
   However, a citizens' group based near the plant said it would
continue to fight the plan.
   Frances Skolnick of the Susquehanna Valley Alliance said the
decision ``isn't unexpected.''
   ``It enables us to go outside of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and to the courts,'' she said. ``We will definitely seek
relief.''
   She said it had not decided where the challenge would be filed.
   The alliance joined a second group, Three Mile Island Alert, as
an intervenor in the NRC's review of the matter last year. The
groups had asked General Public Utilities Nuclear, the plant
operator, to consider other alternatives, including storing the
water in tanks for perhaps 30 years to allow radiation to decay.
   But the licensing board, which studied the issue on behalf of
the commissioners, found on Feb. 3 that the storage plan ``is not
obviously superior to the evaporation proposal.''
   The NRC vote clears the way for issuing an amendment to the
plant's operating license permitting GPU Nuclear to begin
evaporating the water. The amendment is to be issued by the
commission staff, but NRC spokesman John Kopeck said he did not
know when.
   About 260,000 gallons of water was contaminated in the plant's
Unit 2 reactor building basement as the result of the 1979
accident. The rest of the water was used in cleanup operations
afterward.
   GPU Nuclear proposed to dispose of the water by boiling it into
steam released from a 100-foot-high stack, and packaging impurities
for shipment to a low-level radioactive waste dump.
   Last spring, GPU Nuclear raised eyebrows among local citizens by
spending $800,000 on the evaporation system even before the
licensing board had held hearings to decide whether the system
could be used.
   The $7 million evaporation process is part of the $1 billion
cleanup of Unit 2. During the accident, uranium fuel was allowed to
lose the vital cooling water that normally covers it, causing
material in the radioactive core to melt.

   Sandi Patti has been voted gospel
music's No. 1 female singer for the eighth straight year and Amy
Grant has been chosen top artist for the third time.
   The two heartfelt vocalists shared major honors Thursday night
with the new a cappella group Take 6, which won four awards at the
20th annual Gospel Music Association awards show.
   Ms. Patti, who has dominated Christian music awards this decade,
won five honors and Ms. Grant earned three.
   Besides winning female vocalist of the year, Ms. Patti won top
inspirational song for ``In Heaven's Eyes,'' No. 1 inspirational
album for ``Make His Praise Glorious,'' choral collection album of
the year for ``Sandi Patti Choral Praise'' and instrumental album
for ``A Symphony of Praise.'' The instrumental award was for the
musicianship of others on the album and not for her vocals.
   ``I sure like what I'm doing,'' Ms. Patti said later. ``I'd do
it if there were awards or not.''
   Ms. Grant broke Ms. Patti's two-year reign as artist of the year
and also won for best contemporary gospel album and short-form
video, both for ``Lead Me On.''
   She said the recording of ``Lead Me On'' was interrupted by the
birth of her son, Matthew, in 1987.
   ``I don't feel like the same girl who started the project,'' she
said, chuckling.
   Ms. Grant, of Nashville, also was voted artist of the year in
1983 and 1986.
   Take 6, which won two Grammy awards in February, added to their
award stockpile even though they have been singing for only two
years and have released just one album.
   The Nashville group was voted group of the year and best new
artist, and won top black gospel album for ``Take 6'' and No. 1
contemporary black gospel song for ``If We Ever.''
   Wayne Watson, who heeded his parents' suggestions to concentrate
on music rather than playing baseball, was named male vocalist of
the year.
   ``I try to be grateful to the Lord and not get puffed up,'' said
Watson, who sings about starving children, people with AIDS and
those who are unfulfilled in religion.
   Watson, of Houston, also won song-of-the-year honors for his
``Friend of a Wounded Heart.''
   Veteran gospel singer Shirley Caesar also was a double winner,
taking awards for black gospel song for ``Hold My Mule'' and
traditional black gospel album for ``Live in Chicago.''
   Two heavy metal categories were added to the awards this year,
and both were won by the four-member group Stryper. Their ``In God
We Trust'' was voted recorded metal gospel song of the year and
also metal album of the year.
   Bruce Carroll was another double winner, taking honors for
country gospel recorded song for ``Above and Beyond'' and country
gospel album for ``Richest Man in Town.''
   The awards, presented at a 3{-hour gala at the Tennessee
Performing Arts Center, are called the Dove Awards to signify the
bird that appeared in the biblical account of the baptism of Christ.
   Winners were chosen by the singers, musicians and songwriters in
the 3,000-member association, based in Nashville. The ceremonies
were not televised.

   Carold Copeland's 1972 high school class
ring has finally found its way back to him _ 17 years and several
thousand miles later.
   The 37-year-old Copeland had given up on the ring after it was
stolen from his apartment in 1972.
   Last week, Richard Dickerson walked into Copeland's radiator
shop, pulled out the ring and asked, ``Does this look familiar?''
   Dickerson, an Oklahoma City native, found the ring in 1972 in a
restaurant washroom in Saigon, Vietnam, where he was on military
duty. He tossed it in a bag and forgot about it.
   Years later Dickerson came across the ring and asked a friend
working at Shreveport television station KSLA to try to locate its
owner. The friend's wife called school officials, who determined
the ring's owner through the initials on it.
   Dickerson sent the ring to the friend at the television station
to pass along to Copeland. The friend, though, absent-mindedly
placed it in a desk, where it has been for the last year or so.
   In August, Dickerson, 44, joined KSLA's marketing department.
Last week, when a desk was being cleaned out, the ring was found.
Dickerson took it to Copeland.
   ``It's kind of amazing that my ring went around the world and I
didn't,'' Copeland said.

<HEAD>Agency Quits Verifying Social Security Numbers for Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Security Administration will stop
verifying citizens' Social Security numbers for credit bureaus and
financial institutions because of a recent Supreme Court ruling on
the privacy of government records.
   Commissioner Dorcas R. Hardy announced the decision late
Thursday, days after a senator called the verification practice for
private businesses ``the largest breach of privacy in the history
of the program.''
   ``The Social Security Administration takes very seriously its
important responsibility of protecting the privacy of the records
it maintains on over 200 million Americans,'' Hardy said in
announcing the change.
   She said a Supreme Court decision March 22 ``significantly
narrowed the circumstances under which information on individuals
can be released.'' Under that 9-0 decision, the court said the FBI
may withhold its ``rap sheets'' on 24 million Americans from public
disclosure.
   The move will stop the SSA from verifying 140 million names and
Social Security submitted by TRW Credit Data, Hardy said. The firm
made the huge request last year, prompting Hardy to order a review
of the legal status of the release of such information.
   Sen. David H. Pryor, D-Ark., who raised the issue Monday at a
hearing of the Senate Committee on Aging, hailed the decision. But
he told The Washington Post, ``This action comes too late to
protect some 150,000 people whose files were violated during a test
run conducted for TRW and for more than 3 million people on whom
verifications were conducted for Citibank and other firms in past
years.''
   Pryor this week wrote Secretary of Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan to investigate verifications by TRW and
Citicorp. Pryor had called them ``the largest breach of privacy in
the history of the program.''
   Since the late 1970s, Social Security has routinely performed
``negative verifications'' by telling businesses upon request
whether a name and Social Security do not match. It would not say
whether a name and number match.
   No other information, such as wages and benefits, was given
without the individual person's permission. And the agency would
not grant requests for a person's Social Security number.
   The verifications were made under an interpretation of the
Freedom of Information Act.
   The agency will continue to verify Social Security numbers for
employers who must have the correct numbers for workers, Hardy said.

<TEXT>
   Maronite Catholics are locked in a
civil war with their Moslem countrymen in Lebanon but they live in
peace with Moslem neighbors on this Mediterranean island, itself
divided by another war.
   Yet both Maronite communities are struggling for survival _
those in Lebanon against political domination by Syrian-backed
forces, and their brethren in Cyprus against shrinking numbers.
   Cyprus lies only 100 miles northwest of Lebanon, where a civil
war between Christians and Moslems has raged for 14 years.
   Some 5,000 Maronites live in Cyprus, divided since 1974 when the
Turkish Army invaded in the wake of a short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
   Only 350 Maronites still live in northern Cyprus, controlled by
Turkey and largely populated by Moslem Turkish Cypriots.
   Clustered in four villages on the northwestern tip of the
island, the community is dwindling as young people move to the more
prosperous Greek Cypriot sector in the south, which is mainly
Christian.
   As the community in Kormakiti, Asomados, Karpacha and Ayia
Marina dwindles, so does the culture their ancestors first brought
to Cyprus 900 years ago when they fled Moslem persecution in Syria
and parts of Lebanon.
   The main Maronite sect, named after the 5th Century monk St.
Maroun, whose monastery in Syria was destroyed in 938 A.D. by
Moslem invaders, lived in the mountains.
   ``The new generation is going to Greek Cypriot schools and they
don't speak Arabic. Only the old people speak Arabic now,'' said
Archbishop Butros Gemayel, a relative of former Lebanese President
Amin Gemayel.
   He was elected last June in Lebanon and is the first
Cyprus-based Maronite archbishop in 300 years.
   The Maronites have remained neutral in the conflict between the
island's Turks and Greeks and are the only people outside the
United Nations peacekeeping force allowed to cross the island's
dividing Green Line unhindered once a month.
   ``We have nothing against the Turks. We saved many Turkish lives
during the war,'' said John Mavrides, the Parliamentary
representative of the Maronite community.
   ``Special sentiments link us to Lebanon, but the people of
Kormakiti are the only ones who still speak some Arabic,'' said
Mavrides.
   Kormakati, population 230, is the main Maronite village, 22
miles northwest of the capital, Nicosia.
   It has a school with 18 pupils under age 10, a church run by
94-year-old Father Antonios Terzi and the ``Lebanon'' cafe but no
hospital.
   ``The sick have to go to Kyrenia or Nicosia, but if it's very
serious, we call the doctor from a nearby Turkish Cypriot
village,'' said Amida Hannarusso, who runs Kormakiti's only cafe.
   In the 16th century 80,000 Maronites lived in 70 villages in
Cyprus. But, like other groups on the island, they suffered
persecution and massacres by the various invaders, including the
Moslem Turks.
   They survived. But when the Turks invaded in 1974, many of the
young people moved south with 200,000 Greek Cypriots who either
fled or were expelled by the invaders. Some 70,000 Turkish Cypriots
fled north.
   Most of the Maronites remaining in the north are old people who
mainly work the land.
   The Greek Cypriot authorities send food supplies twice a month
to the Maronite villages and provide free education for Maronite
children whose parents live in the north. Maronites in the Greek
Cyriot sector also provide financial assistance.
   Those who moved south have largely integrated, scattered over
the Greek sector, rather than living in exclusively Maronite
neighborhoods.
   Valentino Piribitsi, a Maronite born in Cyprus three years
before the Turkish invasion, said: ``We're all Cypriots.''
   Piribitsi has lived in Nicosia since his parents left Kormakiti
in 1980 so he and his sister could attend a Christian secondary
school.
   However, another young Maronite, Kyriakos, who declined to give
his family name, said he feels his brethren are discriminated
against by the Greek Cypriots, who are mainly Greek Orthodox.
   ``If a Maronite and a Greek Cypriot with the same qualifications
apply for a job, the Greek Cypriot would be chosen in most cases,''
said Kyriakos, 22.
   Gemayel acknowledged his community now faces ``an identity
crisis'' in Cyprus.
   The Maronite link with Lebanon is still strong because ``that's
where their roots are, that's the religious center,'' he said.
   But if the island was reunited and the Cypriot national identity
becomes stronger than loyalty to the community, ``the Maronites'
longing for Lebanon will only be religious, rather than ethnic,''
he lamented.
   Kyriakos noted: ``I don't care much about Lebanon, like the
older generation does. I don't identify with the Lebanese. I'm
Cypriot.''

   Two graduate students says they detected
indications of cold fusion in an experiment they conducted with
heavy water, while Georgia Tech researchers now are saying their
own results may have been flawed.
   Van L. Eden and Wei Liu, physics students at the University of
Washington, said Thursday they failed to duplicate exactly the
highly publicized experiment by University of Utah chemist B.
Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann of England's University of
Southampton. But they did get indications fusion may have taken
place in their experiment last week.
   Pons and Fleischmann said they apparently produced nuclear
fusion in a table-top experiment using ordinary lab equipment.
   Meanwhile, Georgia Tech researchers disclosed on Thursday their
experiment may have been skewed by inaccuracies in a key piece of
equipment that measured an emission of neutrons, a sure sign of
fusion. The researchers said their probe may give false readings
caused by heat at low temperatures.
   ``It's not as sure a thing as it was,'' senior researcher James
Mahaffey said in Atlanta. ``It seemed like a sure thing. Now, I'm
getting nervous.''
   Mahaffey said the experiment would be run again to determine if
the equipment caused error in the project's results.
   He acknowledged that Monday's announcement of success might have
been premature.
   Normally, a nuclear fusion reaction requires extreme
temperatures and pressures; fusion at low temperatures _ so-called
cold fusion _ could mean a cheap, clean and nearly inexhaustible
power source.
   The Georgia Tech experiment _ and another announced Monday by
researchers at Texas A&amp;M _ appeared to confirm a March 23 reaction
obtained by Pons and Fleischmann.
   In Eden and Liu's experiment, a mass spectrometer detected a
possible indicator of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen
commonly produced in fusion reactions.
   The indicator was found when the experiment was run using
deuterium, a hydrogen isotope and component of deuterium oxide, or
heavy water. Eden said the indicator was not detected when the test
was repeated with ordinary water.
   Both researchers cautioned that the results were preliminary and
needed review by other scientists. They also said they had not
ruled out other explanations for what they observed.
   ``We knew we had seen something that was exciting,'' Eden said.
``It is open to alternative interpretation. There is no question
about that.''
   Eden he and Liu put together the experiment with existing lab
equipment, metals in stock and ``some heavy water sitting around
the lab.''
   He said their major out-of-pocket expense was for ``about three
pizzas'' bought by Liu.

   A convicted cocaine dealer seeking a light
sentence cited his 540-pound build, but the judge said the argument
carried little weight.
   James Edward Roath said he felt ``less than a human being''
because of his obesity. Dealing drugs made him feel needed, argued
Roath's attorney, Donald Lykkebak.
   ``Where was his conscience?'' Circuit Judge Robert McGregor
responded. ``That is a matter of the mind, not of the body.''
   The judge sentenced Roath, 32, to 3{ years in prison and a
$50,000 fine.
   Holding onto a table and podium for support, Roath apologized to
the judge Wednesday and tried to get him to agree to a shorter
sentence than that allowed by state guidelines.
   The judge was not moved, however. He said Roath should learn to
cope with his handicap and not use it as an excuse for
``contributing to a national epidemic of cocaine.''

   Afghanistan's ambassador to India,
speaking on the first anniversary of the Geneva Accord that led to
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from his country, accused the
United States today of ignoring ``the spirit and the letter'' of
the U.N.-sponsored agreement.
   ``The Geneva Accord is fully implemented by Afghanistan and the
Soviet Union, but unfortunately the other parties concerned have
not implemented it and the situation has gotten more tense than
ever before,'' Abdul Samad Azhar told reporters.
   He repeated his government's accusations that the United States
and Pakistan were continuing to arm Moslem guerrillas who have
trying the past decade to overthrow the Soviet-style party that
took power by coup and assassination in 1978.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan pledged in the Geneva Accord not to
interfere in each other's internal affairs. The Soviet Union, whose
troops fought alongside Afghan government troops against the
guerrillas for nine years, and the United States, one of the
guerrillas' staunchest backers, signed as guarantors.
   Under the accord, Moscow withdrew its 115,000 soldiers from
Afghanistan in phases. The last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan on
Feb. 15.
   The Soviets continue to supply President Najib's army with
weapons, including long-range Scud-B missiles now used by
government troops against the guerrillas besieging the strategic
eastern city of Jalalabad.
   ``The Soviet Union fully implemented the accord. They withdrew
their troops,'' Azhar said. ``But the other side, the United States
of America, did not respect the letter and spirit. They are
continuing supplying weapons to the rebels. Every day more
sophisticated weapons are being supplied.''
   Asked what these weapons were, the ambassador listed
anti-aircraft Stinger missiles and surface-to-surface missiles that
he said had ranges of 18 to 50 miles.
   Azhar also criticized the slowness with which foreign aid is
arriving for the reconstruction of his country. A year ago, he
said, there had been talk of an international program similar to
the Marshall Plan for Europe after the devastation of World War II.
   ``Unfortunately, in practice we see a Marshall Plan for the
destruction of Afghanistan, not the reconstruction,'' the
ambassador said.
   Western nations have been reluctant to send aid that could help
prolong the longevity of the Najib government. In addition, with
civil war raging throughout much of Afghanistan, relief agencies of
the United Nations and other international groups say they are
hamstrung in operating outside Kabul.
   The ambassador reiterated his government's position that it was
willing to call new elections under U.N. supervision. The
mujahedeen guerrillas, whose name means Islamic holy warriors, have
refused to participate in any election while Najib and his People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan remains in power.

   A proposal to place video surveillance
cameras on bridges leading to their ritzy island is winning support
from residents despite warnings it would focus a spotlight on the
town's elitist image.
   More than 40 residents turned out in support of the plan to
record every car, truck, bicycle and pedestrian heading to the
island when it was discussed Wednesday by the Public Safety
Committee.
   But others recalled negative national publicity the town
received about a law requiring blue-collar workers to carry
identification cards, declared unconstitutional by a federal judge
in 1985.
   ``This type of situation might work against us in our public
image,'' Phillip Radlauer said. ``We've been taking a terrible
beating as an elitist community.''
   Robert Oreck, a landlord, proposed the plan to increase security.
   ``Let's put the criminals on notice _ Palm Beach, Florida, is
not the place to ply their trade,'' Oreck said.
   Town Attorney John Randolph said the plan does not appear to be
unconstitutional.
   ``There is no expectation of privacy in one's use of a public
street,'' he said.
   Security concerns have been heightened after a woman from nearby
Lake Worth was killed Feb. 6 and her body was dumped in the road
next to the Bath &amp; Tennis Club.
   Proponents of the plan also cited the case of Mark Baltes, who
was run over and killed in 1986 by a car driven by a man who lived
in West Palm Beach.
   Under the plan, police officers would review tapes made during a
specified period before and after a crime.
   The committee sent the proposal to the Town Council, which meets
Monday.

   A bored firefighter who jokingly told two
teen-agers calling the station to set a fire must pay for the
damage to a vacant house which the youths subsequently torched, a
judge has ruled.
   Barry Scott McDonald, 21, was found guilty of storefront burning
and ordered to pay for the $1,630 damage the blaze did to the
house's front porch.
   Under Maryland law, someone who incites such a crime can be
punished the same way as the person who commits it.
   ``Apparently they (the teen-agers) knew some of the guys at the
station and were joking back and forth. People in the background
were shouting addresses and places to set fires,'' McDonald's
attorney, Barry Diamond, said Thursday in recounting the telephone
call.
   ``But the kid who actually set the fire pointed his finger at my
client,'' he said.
   In Anne Arundel County Circuit Court on Tuesday, Diamond told
Judge Bruce C. Williams that the July 31 call to the Orchard Beach
fire station came on a night when the firefighters on duty,
including McDonald, had nothing to do.
   Soon after, the fire department was called to a fire at an
abandoned house a few blocks away.
   McDonald thought the teens could tell he was kidding, Diamond
said.
   But McDonald told colleagues after the fire was reported, ``See,
I told you he would do it,'' Assistant State's Attorney Philip
Caroom said.
   McDonald, a volunteer with the 45-member company since 1985, was
suspended from firefighting duties after the blaze, said company
Chief Walt Snyder.
   Both McDonald and the teen-agers live in Orchard Beach, a tiny
community about 10 miles south of Baltimore.
   Williams sentenced McDonald to probation before judgment, which
allows him to keep a clean criminal record if he completes his
three years of probation without incident.
   He also will have to pay court costs and perform 50 hours of
community service, although he is barred from taking part in any
firefighting work.
   The names of the teen-agers and the status of their cases were
withheld because of juvenile court confidentiality rules. However,
Caroom said they were ordered along with McDonald to pay for damage
to the house.
   Storefront burning refers to arson at an unoccupied building.
Under Maryland law, it is less serious than arson but still carries
a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison.
   ``I would say he's extremely lucky that the kids did select an
unoccupied structure and that there was minimal damage done to
it,'' Caroom said.

<HEAD>Eldest Son Of Late President Chiang Dead At 54</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chiang Hsiao-wen, eldest son of the late
President Chiang Ching-kuo, died of throat cancer today, a hospital
said.
   Chiang, 54, died at Taipei's Veterans General Hospital where he
was admitted in September when doctors discovered a large tumor in
his throat during a medical checkup, the hospital said in a
statement.
   Chiang was chairman of the state Taiwan Power Co. for two years
before serving briefly as vice president of a petrochemical firm
run by the ruling Nationalist Party. He resigned from the
petrochemical company in 1970 when he suffered brain damage while
being treated for diabetes. Since then he led a secluded life.
   Chiang was born in the Soviet Union when his father was working
at a metallurgical plant in the Urals. His father went to the
Soviet Union in 1925 to study and later married a Russian, Faina,
who lives in Taiwan.
   The elder Chiang died in January 1988. He had two other sons and
a daughter _ Hsiao-wu, who heads the Taiwan mission in Singapore;
businessman Hsiao-yung in Canada; and daughter Hsiao-chang, who
lives in Berkeley, Calif.
   Hospital officials said Chiang Hsiao-wen's wife, Nai-chin, his
daughter, Yo-mei, and brother Hsiao-wu were at his bedside when he
died.
   Funeral services will be held April 25.

   A prisoner has filed a lawsuit seeking $100 for
each of 250 hair follicles he contends fell out after he used a
hair gel.
   Gregory Smith, who is in the St. Louis City Jail awaiting trial
on a rape charge, said in his lawsuit filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court that he lost much of his hair after using Pro 39 Gel
Pomade for five weeks.
   Smith, 28, is seeking $25,000 in damages plus about $1,000 in
attorney fees and for reimbursement of the cost of the gel. He said
he began using the product on Oct. 13, while in jail, and continued
using it until Nov. 19. ``On that date, after washing my hair and
scalp, my hair came out,'' he said.
   The lawsuit said Smith used no other hair products during that

   Thieves operating out of a railroad
station near Bombay have come up with a new ploy: a cup of tea that
packs a powerful and costly punch, an Indian news agency reported
today.
   United News of India said the thieves mingle with licensed tea
vendors on the platform at Kalyan, 25 miles northeast of Bombay,
and sell tea spiked with intoxicants. Gang members then board the
trains as passengers, wait for their victims to nod off, and
relieve them of cash and other belongings.
   UNI said a memo warning of the scam had been received recently
by the Central Railways Authority. The news agency did not say how
long the gang had been operating or how many people might have been
victimized.

   Disc jockeys at a rock station didn't think
they'd get a response when they invited former Gov. Harold Stassen
to call in and win $99.50 on his 82nd birthday.
   The perennial presidential candidate took advantage of the

   John Hines and Bob Berglund, the morning hosts at WLOL-FM,
declared Thursday, Stassen's birthday, ``Harold Stassen Call In and

   At 8:45 a.m., they got the call.
   ``Bergie,'' Hines told his partner over the air, ``say good

   ``Well, you're kidding,'' a shocked Berglund said. ``Good

   ``Good morning,'' Stassen replied.
   ``Somebody told him and he called in,'' said producer Mark

   Stassen was Minnesota governor from 1939 through 1943.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has
reduced its operations in Peru's cocaine-producing jungle for
security reasons, U.S. officials said.
   The cutback began two months ago after the security chief of the
U.S. Embassy received a minor leg wound in January by gunmen firing
at a U.S. helicopter from the ground, said embassy spokesman
Charles Loveridge.
   The violence occurred in the Upper Huallaga valley near Tingo
Maria, 240 miles northeast of Lima. Officials say more than 60
percent of the world's coca, the raw material of cocaine, is grown
in the region.
   Operation Snowcap, under which DEA agents advise Peru's Civil
Guard on eradicating coca fields and cocaine-producing
laboratories, was suspended in mid-February, said Catherine Shaw of
the department's office of International Narcotics Matters in
Washington.
   ``They're regrouping, looking for ways to make the base camp
more secure,'' she said.
   The United States has been slowly building up its anti-drug
force in the region the last two years, but violence stemming from
an alliance between drug traffickers and Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas has recently increased security risks, U.S. officials
said.
   Loveridge said the United States was temporarily halting its
coca eradication program and interdiction efforts to allow time to
analyze the effectiveness of the anti-drug effort.
   He declined to say exactly how many U.S. officials have been
withdrawn but said about 12 still are stationed in the region.
   ``It certainly is not an end to our efforts. We will be out
there and fighting drugs for a long time to come,'' Loveridge said.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said in Washington the
decision does not mean a reduction in the number of U.S. agents in
Peru, only a reassignment.
   ``There are other kinds of work that can be done down there,
such as intelligence, that sort of thing,'' he said.
   Loveridge said construction is continuing on a fortified
helicopter base near Tingo Maria and U.S. agents are continuing to
train and advise Peruvian police in anti-drug operations.
   Nine U.S. helicopters, rented from private companies and loaned
to the Peruvian government, are still in operation in the region,
Loveridge said.
   Ms. Shaw, who said she was not aware of any particular threats
against the agents, added, ``There have been, over the years, many
threats against the eradication workers.''
   Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., disclosed the suspension
Wednesday at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on
crime, which he chairs.

   A Soviet submarine taking part in naval maneuvers
got caught in the fishing net of a Danish trawler in the Baltic Sea
and had to be cut loose, the official Tass news agency said today.
   The incident took place April 4 during joint maneuvers with the
East German navy and three days before a Soviet nuclear submarine
caught fire and sank off Norway, the news agency said. Forty-two
sailors died in the Norwegian Sea accident.
   Tass said ships escorting the submarine displayed warning flags
indicating underwater maneuvers were underway and that vessels in
the area were warned by radio to exercise caution.
   Despite the warnings, Tass said, ``Danish authorities reported
that the Soviet submarine had been caught in the net of a trawler
from Bornholm Island. As this posed a threat to fishermen, the net
was cut off.''
   Tass said there were no injuries and that the trawler was
undamaged.
   ``Certainly we regret the occurred incident,'' Tass quoted an
unidentified government spokesman as saying. ``It is important to
note, however, that all precautionary measures under the existing
international practice were taken to conduct the exercises.''
   The news agency said the maneuvers took place on open seas south
of Bornholm Island, 100 miles southeast of the Danish mainland.
   Tass did not say why it took 10 days to report the incident.

   The letter was signed, but police said they could not confirm

   White said he was thrilled to receive the letter and accepts the
apology.
   ``But I hope he has learned his lesson. He got off lucky this

   White said his car was stolen from his apartment parking lot.
The car was damaged before it was recovered and the stereo system

<HEAD>Sinhalese Evacuated After 41 Die In Car Bombing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Sinhalese in the port of
Trincomalee took refuge in a navy dockyard today after 41 people
were killed in a car bombing, military officials said.
   Indian peacekeeping troops patrolling the city reported no new
violence, but a curfew imposed after Thursday's blast remained in
effect. Indian and Sri Lankan officials blamed the bombing on Tamil
militants.
   Sri Lankan military officials in Colombo said three people died
in hospitals today of injuries suffered in the blast. Thirty-eight
others died on Thursday, and at least 54 were injured.
   Most of Trincomalee's estimated 12,000 Sinhalese residents were
evacuated to the dockyard for their safety, the Sri Lankan
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Tamils account for about 60 percent of the city's 35,000 people,
while Sinhalese make up 35 percent. There also is a small Moslem
minority.
   Nalin Seneviratna, head of the provincial council in
northeastern Sri Lanka, said the car that exploded outside a hotel
and shopping arcade was packed with an estimated 110 pounds of
explosives hidden under a pile of coconuts.
   He said all but two of those killed were Sinhalese who were
shopping for gifts and sweets to mark their New Year's Day, which
was celebrated Thursday. The others were members of the Tamil
minority, which observed the New Year's Day today.
   Shortly after the explosion, angry Sinhalese attacked Tamils. At
least four Tamils were stabbed to death and seven were wounded,
said Seneviratna.
   Sri Lankan military officials blamed a group of Tamil
extremists, the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, for
the blast. Indian officials blamed the largest Tamil rebel militia,
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
   A spokesman for the Tigers in Colombo denied responsibility for
the explosion.
   The bombing was linked to the killing of six Tamil villagers on
Tuesday in remote Kurinchkerni village in Trincomalee district,
about 145 miles northeast of the capital Colombo, military
officials said.
   Indian peacekeeping troops have been in northern and eastern Sri
Lanka since July 1987 to disarm Tamil rebels and enforce a peace
accord aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency that began in 1983.
   At least 12,500 people, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed in
the Tamil insurrection and the backlash from Sinhalese extremists
opposed to the peace accord.
   Sinhalese militants claimed the accord gave too many concessions
to the Tamil minority and began a bloody campaign to dislodge the
government for signing the agreement with India.
   India became involved in the ethnic troubles of its southern
neighbor because of 60 million politically powerful Tamils in south
India.
   Tamils, mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people. Militants have waged a war against the government
for an independent state in the north and east of the island
nation, where they are a majority.
   They claim they are discriminated against by the mostly Buddhist
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa had ordered a one-week truce and
offered amnesty to Sinhalese and Tamil rebels willing to surrender
arms. The explosion occurred on the second day of the cease-fire
that began to coincide with the local New Year.

<TEXT>
   A man who fails to support his child's
mother emotionally and financially prior to birth loses his
standing in an adoption case, the Florida Supreme Court has ruled.
   ``Because prenatal care of the pregnant mother and unborn child
is critical to the well-being of the child and of society, the
biological father, wed or unwed, has a responsibility to provide
support during the pre-birth period,'' Justice Leander Shaw wrote
for the majority in a 6-1 opinion Thursday.
   Failure to provide that support can constitute abandonment.
Normally, a father's consent is required for adoption, but a father
who abandons his unborn child loses that right, the high court held.
   The ruling is important because it sets the precedent that the
father's level of ``prebirth support'' can be considered by a judge
to determine his standing in an adoption case.
   The ruling came in the case of an infant identified only as John
Doe to protect his identity. A judge in Orange County rejected the
request of the biological parents, dubbed Richard and Mary Roe, to
regain custody from the adoptive parents, Bob and Jane Doe.
   The Roes were unwed when the baby was born Sept. 12, 1986.
   The 5th District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach reversed the
decision, but allowed the baby to stay with the adoptive parents
pending the Supreme Court ruling.
   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice Parker Lee McDonald wrote
that the majority has deprived the biological parents, now married,
of their child ``without a finding that the natural parents are
unfit in the slightest. I think it is a sad day.''
   When Mary Roe became pregnant, the father said he wasn't ready
to commit to marriage, in part because of financial pressure, and
urged her to have an abortion, Shaw wrote.
   She refused, lost her job and lived off public welfare and
charity. While Roe failed to provide support, they continued to see
each other and he initially voiced no objection to adoption,
although never giving formal consent.
   The Supreme Court also ruled the mother couldn't withdraw her
consent to the adoption, although she attempted to do so only a few
days after the child was given to the Does three days after the
baby was born.
   She contended her consent had been given under the duress of her
personal circumstances, but those circumstances changed when Roe
agreed to marry her.
   The high court held a mother can revoke her consent after
adoption only if another person had exerted coercion, duress or
fraud to procure that consent.

<TEXT>
   Former Interior Minister Karl Blecha
resigned today from his remaining government and party posts
because of a scandal over the mysterious sinking of a ship in 1977.
   Blecha, 55, once considered one of the most powerful officials
in the Socialist Party, stepped down as a parliamentary deputy and
as a deputy party chairman.
   He relinquished his ministerial post on Jan. 19.
   The Austria Press Agency quoted Blecha as saying he resigned
from his offices in order to fight allegations made against him in
connection with the so-called Lucona scandal.
   A parliamentary committee is investigating possible insurance
fraud in connection with the 1977 sinking of the vessel in the
Indian Ocean. Six sailors died.
   Blecha has denied aiding Udo Proksch, the main suspect in the
sinking who remains at large. Proksch is wanted on suspicion of
murder and insurance fraud.
   The Lucona's cargo was officially described as materials for a
uranium processing plant and was insured for $16 million. The
insurance company refused to pay, claiming the cargo was scrap
metal.
   Testifying before the investigating committee this week, Robert
Koeck, a senior security official in the Interior Ministry, said
that as interior minister Blecha had given instructions to stop
police investigations into the sinking.
   Leopold Gratz, another powerful Socialist Party official who
also is accused of aiding Proksch, resigned as president of
Parliament on Jan. 25. Both men have denied wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Former President Heading Conservative List In European Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing said
today he will give up his seat in the National Assembly to head the
French conservative campaign in elections June 18 for the European
Parliament.
   Giscard d'Estaing, 62, also said he would be interested in
becoming speaker of the 518-member Parliament, made up of
representatives elected from the 12 countries of the European
Economic Community.
   The national council of the center-right Union for French
Democracy (UDF) voted Thursday night to join the rightist Rally for
the Republic (RPR) in backing a list of candidates headed by the
former president.
   One of the component parties of the UDF, the Union of the
Center, is expected to decide later this month to back a separate
list led by Simone Veil, a former speaker of the European
Parliament, rather than the joint UDF-RPR list.
   The UDF council rejected 49-13 a proposal, from a group calling
itself the ``Renovators,'' for calling a joint convention to try to
put together a list of younger candidates who might unite the
conservative and centrist forces.
   The Renovators, who include some of the most popular younger
leaders of both the UDF and RPR, have made a move in recent weeks
to displace a generation that has led the French center-right the
past 15 years.
   Giscard d'Estaing, president of France from 1974-81, is chairman
of the National Assembly's foreign affairs committee and president
of the UDF.
   He is not prohibited from sitting in both parliaments, but
giving up the National Assembly seat would emphasize his commitment
to working on the European political scene.
   Interviewed on French radio, Giscard d'Estaing said he would
like to be speaker of the European Parliament because he felt
``very involved in this European affair.''
   He said he would urge the centrists not to run a competing list
of candidates.
   Each member country elects members of the European Parliament in
mid-June for a five-year term using its own election laws. In
France, the system of proportional representation is used. The
Socialists have chosen former Premier Laurent Fabius, speaker of
the National Assembly, to head their list.

   The U.N. World Food Program is sending
an emergency shipment of 5,500 tons of rice to Laos to make up for
severe food shortages caused by drought, an official said today.
   The shipment is only enough food for a fraction of the more than
730,000 people affected by last year's drought, said Jane Blaxland,
director of operations of the agency's office for Thailand and Laos.
   A study by the World Food Program and the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization estimated the drought caused a shortage of
68,200 tons of rice, she said.
   The U.N. agency paid for the rice from emergency money and is
calling on the international community to finance further
shipments, Miss Blaxland said.
   The drought severely affected about 60 percent of the population
in Savannakhet, Champassak and Khammouane provinces, which a World
Food Program news release said normally account for 40 percent of
the country's rice.
   It said Laos is expected to face an acute food shortage
beginning this month as stocks from the 1988 growing season become
exhausted.
   ``Some people have been selling their buffalos since January to
buy rice,'' said Miss Blaxland, who visited Champassak two weeks
ago. ``We saw trucks full of buffalos leaving those districts to be
sold.
   ``We think we've seen the effects of malnutrition just about to
start among the children,'' she said.
   Laos, which has been under Communist rule since 1975, is one of
the world's poorest nations, with a per capita income estimated at
$135 in 1985.

   A fierce shelling duel between Syrian and
Christian gunners kept civilians off the streets today and delayed
a French humanitarian mission to Lebanon.
   Only a handful of people ventured out of basements and
underground bomb shelters early in the day to shop for food
supplies after the clashes subsided into sporadic mortar exchanges.
   By police count, 215 people have been killed and 727 wounded
since the current confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces started
March 8.
   A police spokesman said 25,000 shells and rockets slammed into
Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors in the 20-hour duel that
coincided with the 14th anniversary of the outbreak of civil war in
1975.
   The exchange eased hours after an Arab League panel meeting in
Kuwait issued its third cease-fire appeal the past month.
   ``The committee repeats its calls for a cease fire ... and
continues its intensified efforts to put an end to the suffering of
the Lebanese people,'' said a statement by the six-member panel
headed by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah.
   The statement also noted ``the failure of the warring sides in
Lebanon to abide by their pledges to consolidate the cease-fire.''
   The committee, formed in January, earlier wrapped up talks with
a delegation of right-wing Christian Lebanese politicians on ending
the current violence and solving a six-month political crisis that
threatens to cement the nation's de facto partition into sectarian
cantons.
   Two French navy vessels, the hospital ship La Rance and a
tanker, the Penhors, remained outside Lebanese territorial waters
awaiting sailing orders from French Humanitarian Assistance
Minister Bernard Kouchner, who is in Beirut.
   The hospital ship was due to drop anchor in Lebanese waters
Thursday and take Moslem and Christian wounded on board, but the
shelling forced ``postponement of the operation until further
notice,'' said a source with the Moslem Cabinet of acting prime
minister Salim Hoss.
   The tanker was to deliver fuel oil to Moslem- and
Christian-controlled ports so that power stations can continue
providing electricity.
   The main power distribution plant in Beirut's Christian Jamhour
suburb was struck in a rocket barrage Thursday, blacking out the
city and surrounding areas.
   ``The French-donated supplies of fuel oil will help us generate
power, but it cannot be distributed unless the Jamhour distribution
station is repaired,'' the electricity authority said in a
statement.
   ``Repair work cannot be launched unless a cease-fire is
reached,'' the statement added.

<TEXT>
   Two guerrillas were killed by security
forces this week after negotiators had worked out a plan for the
insurgents to withdraw safely to Angola, a territorial official
said today.
   Gerhard Roux, spokesman for the South African-installed
administrator of Namibia, confirmed the deaths, which were reported
by a South African newspaper Thursday. He said details would be
available later today.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said about 350
guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization had
withdrawn and about 900 remained in Namibia as of today, a day
before a deadline for them to leave.
   He said about 1,600 guerrillas infiltrated into northern Namibia
beginning April 1, the first day of a cease-fire and a year-long,
U.N.-supervised process to make the territory independent. During
the next eight days, 263 guerrillas and 27 members of the South
African-led security forces reportedly were killed in fighting.
   Botha's estimate of SWAPO infiltrators was lower than previous
South African estimates of 1,900. He said 22 had been captured.
   Last weekend, South African, Cuban and Angolan officials worked
out an arrangement guaranteeing safe passage for guerrillas to
Angola if they reported to U.N.-monitored checkpoints. As of this
morning, however, only five guerrillas had reported to the
checkpoints _ the others who withdrew apparently did so on their
own.
   A U.N. official, Cedric Thornberry, said Thursday the insurgents
probably were reluctant to surface because of the ``menacing
presence'' of security forces near the assembly points.
   The cease-fire has not been reinstated since last week's
fighting, although South Africa has said its forces would fire at
guerrillas only if attacked.
   The deadline for the withdrawal is Saturday, but Botha said his
government is prepared to extend it.
   Botha also agreed with the United Nations that South African
soldiers would not be allowed to interrogate guerrillas who report
to the checkpoints. Territorial officials said Wednesday that such
interrogation would take place, and some South African soldiers
tried to get access to four guerrillas at a checkpoint Thursday but
were rebuffed by Australian and British members of the U.N.
moinitoring force.
   U.N. investigators have supported South Africa's contention that
the guerrillas' incursion violated an accord requiring they stay at
Angolan bases at least until May 15, when they could enter Namibia
as unarmed refugees.
   SWAPO's exiled president, Sam Nujoma, has called on his fighters
to withdraw but has not told them to report to the checkpoints. An
undetermined number have gone back into Angola on their own, and
police say others are likely to try to remain in Namibia in
civilian guise.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia since World War I. In December,
it agreed to begin a transition to independence in exchange for
Cuba withdrawing its estimated 50,000 troops from Angola.
   SWAPO has been fighting against South African rule since 1966
and is favored to get the most votes in pre-independence elections
scheduled for November. There is uncertainty whether it will get
the two-thirds support needed to have full control over formation
of a new government.

<HEAD>Despite Success, Bypass Surgery Not Always Best Course of Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coronary bypass surgery may not be the best
solution for everybody, but it still offers greater benefits to
nearly all heart-disease patients than drugs and diet alone,
according to a study published today.
   ``If you're an 80-year-old who isn't terribly active, but want
to see your grandkids grow up, medical treatment may be
sufficient,'' said Dr. Robert Califf of the Duke University Medical
Center and principal author of the study.
   ``But if you're an 80-year-old who enjoys playing golf and other
exercise, then surgery may very well be worth it,'' he said
Thursday in a telephone interview from his office in Durham, N.C.
   Blockages of the coronary arteries lead to heart attacks, which
claim about 500,000 victims each year and are the leading cause of
death in the United States.
   Debate has raged within the medical community in recent years
over the most efficient and cost-effective manner of treatment.
   ``This message is that while bypass leads to a better outcome,
we're not prescribing surgery for every patient with blocked
arteries,'' Califf said.
   Califf said the new research, published in today's editions of
the Journal of the American Medical Association, better defines the
relative benefits and risks, giving doctors and patients more
information on which to base a decision.
   Currently, about half of all new cases of heart disease are
treated with drugs and diet and lifestyle management, which usually
involves weight loss, exercise and lowering such risk factors as
cholesterol intake and stress.
   Treatment of the remaining cases is split about evenly between
coronary bypass, a procedure in which doctors surgically attach new
blood vessels to improve blood flow, and angioplasty, which
involves surgical insertion of a balloon to widen narrowed arteries.
   The scientists limited the study group to 5,809 coronary disease
patients who received either medical treatment (2,847) or bypass
surgery (2,962) between 1969 and 1984.
   The study found that the greater benefits afforded by coronary
bypass surgery applied across the spectrum of patients, regardless
of age or degree of heart dysfunction, and that both the one-year
and five-year survival rates after surgical treatment climbed
dramatically between 1970 and 1980.
   But Califf said researchers determined that all methods of
treating coronary disease had improved so much in the 15-year
period that bypass surgery, ultimately, may be the best course of
treatment only for those patients with the most severe coronary
blockages.
   Coronary bypass procedures cost about $30,000, compared to ``an
absolute maximum of several thousand'' dollars for drug, diet and
lifestyle therapy.
   The study did not measure the cost-effectiveness of the two
treatments, although Califf is involved in several of a number of
ongoing studies that will do so.
   The study also did not examine angioplasty _ average cost
$12,000 _ as an alternative, and in an editorial in the same issue,
Dr. J. Willis Hurst suggested the time had come for a comparative
study including angioplasty.
   ``Just as general agreement is reached regarding the value of
bypass surgery compared with medical management, we now must
consider the indications for coronary angioplasty,'' said Hurst, of
the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.

<HEAD>`Welcome to the Club,' A New Cy Coleman Musical, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS three grafs with other reviews. No PMs planned. Waara in

<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   There should be room on Broadway for a brash,
boisterous musical that doesn't aspire to more than a few laughs
and a good time.
   But ``Welcome to the Club,'' the new Cy Coleman-A.E. Hotchner
musical, sets its sights low and delivers just that. If it weren't
for Coleman's thoroughly professional score, ``Welcome to the
Club'' would be the most horizontal musical in town.
   The setting is a New York City alimony jail, and the subject is
divorce. Four men and one woman _ a country-western star not unlike
Dolly Parton _ languish in this prison for nonpayment of alimony.
   Hotchner, best known for his autobiography of Ernest Hemingway,
has devised the most minimal of stories, a collection of stock
situations that emphasize crude and rude stereotypes, not people.
   There's the Jewish drugstore owner, played by the ever-mugging
Avery Schreiber. His gorgon of a wife (Marilyn Sokol) wants his
money so she can find happiness in Miami Beach. He plans to escape
to Brazil where American law can't reach him.
   Another member of the club is an insurance man whose wife
suffers from ``B-mania'' caused by excessive shopping at such
places as Bergdorf's, Bendel's, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman's.
   Then there's the cynical writer getting back at his wife by
putting her in his latest magazine article. And of course, the plot
needs the naive young couple whose marriage is falling apart
because of a meddling mother-in-law.
   The best thing about ``Welcome to the Club'' is Coleman's score.
The man who wrote ``Sweet Charity,'' ``Little Me'' and ``Barnum''
is an expert craftsman, capable of the breeziest of melodies. If
anything makes this musical move, it's the music.
   His score is a series of pastiches that includes a
country-western lament, a Rossini-like number for the entire cast,
a sexy, double entendre song and one of those big, belting ballads
_ here called ``The Name of Love'' _ that can rouse any audience to
applause. Of the other numbers, a sweet love song called ``At My
Side'' also lingers after the show. It is done with charming
innocence by Scott Waara and Jodi Benson, the young lovers.
   The show has been cast with strong performers. The classiest is
Marcia Mitzman, playing the writer's ex-wife. She manages to
project a sympathy that isn't apparent in the book. Terri White
growls her way through the blues-tinged ``Piece of Cake'' and then
doesn't have anything to do for the rest of the show.
   Sally Mayes wails effectively as the country singer done wrong,
and she has an amusing musical battle with Scott Wentworth as they
sing about the merits and demerits of the North and South.
   Hotchner's book collapses in Act 2, forcing Coleman to devise
numbers that kill time rather than advance the plot. The ending
also is unsatisfactory. For a musical about divorce, it's strange
that almost everybody ends up back together at the final curtain.
   Despite Coleman's flavorsome score, ``Welcome to the Club'' is a
bargain-basement revue masquerading as a musical.
   In other New York reviews, Frank Rich wrote in The New York
Times that the play ``offers less in the way of gritty domestic
reality than most television commercials for leading headache
remedies. Reflecting the absence of credible characters or drama or
emotions, Mr. Hotchner's book dispenses with scenes and story for
idle song cues.''
   ``This show was a miscalculation from the very second it was
conceived,'' wrote Howard Kissel in the Daily News. ``... A full
evening of spitefulness and recriminations is unimaginably gross.''
   Clive Barnes wrote in the New York Post: ``There are just so
many jokes or joke-variants available about wives, mother-in-laws,
divorce and assorted marital unhappenings that Hotchner can make,
and he probably makes most of them. But this remains a one-joke
revue in search of a story.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of two Czech teenagers
who hijacked a Hungarian plane last month have asked West German
authorities to extradite their children, the Communist Party daily
Rude Pravo reported today.
   Stefan Macicko and Dusan Styk, aged 16 and 17 years
respectively, shot their way onto a Malev Airlines jetliner March
29 and commandeered the plane to Frankfurt after the plane crew
told them the plane was incapable of flying all the way to the
United States.
   Czechoslovakia and West Germany have no extradition treaty and
on past occasions of airline terrorism, hijackers were always
prosecuted under West German law.
   ``The parents ... are aware of the seriousness of criminal acts
committed by their children as well as the ensuing consequences,''
the newspaper quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Ivan Kulhanek as
saying.
   ``Although this is a very serious criminal act, the emotions of
parents cannot be overlooked,'' the daily added.
   ``The request should be judged from the point of view of good
neighhborly relations between Czechoslovakia and West Germany. Our
side has also confirmed the principle of reciprocity in case a West
German plane would be hijacked to Czechoslovakia,'' Kulhanek said.
   Letters in which the parents ask for extradition of their
children to Czechoslovak authorities were handed over to the West
German Embassy on Thursday, the paper reported.

<HEAD>House Approves Resolution To Remove Confederate Flag, Then Reverses

   A resolution from a black legislator
that tiptoed through the Alabama House kicked up a roar when
lawmakers realized they had agreed to remove the Confederate battle
flag from the Capitol dome.
   The unsuspecting lawmakers, on an uncontested voice vote,
approved a resolution by Democratic Rep. Demetrious Newton to
remove the Confederate banner.
   But the lawmakers quickly reversed themselves when they found
out what they had done.
   The flag has been a source of controversy for black leaders, who
have described it as a symbol of bigotry and oppression.
   The resolution proposed by Newton said the Confederate flag atop
the dome was in deplorable condition, and called for it to be
``taken down for complete repair and not returned to its position
until inspected and approved by the sponsor of this resolution.''
   Several minutes after the House approved Newton's resolution, a
white lawmaker, Republican Rep. Arthur Payne, discovered its
contents and asked that the vote be reconsidered.
   The House voted 60-15 to reconsider the resolution and send it
to the Rules Committee, a traditional graveyard for such flag
resolutions.
   Newton said that he had never seen a voice vote reconsidered
before.
   ``I think it was not fairly done. But that is the way the old
cookie crumbles,'' Newton said.
   Newton added he would have returned the flag to the Capitol dome
``at such time as it looked good and was attractive to all
Alabamians.''
   Last year, former state Rep. Thomas Reed and 13 other black
legislators attempted to remove the flag but were blocked by law
enforcement officers and arrested. They were convicted of
trespassing and fined.
   Later, Reed, state president of the National Association for the
   Advancement of Colored People, and the NAACP sued to remove the
banner. U.S. District Judge Robert Varner ruled last month the
banner did not violate the constitutional rights of blacks.
   Gov. Guy Hunt, the state's first Republican governor this
century, has said repeatedly he thinks the Confederate flag is a
historic symbol and he will not remove it unless instructed to do
so by the Legislature.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross
protested to Israel today over the killing of at least five Arabs
during a raid in the occupied West Bank.
   The all-Swiss organization appealed to the Israeli government to
stop violating ``fundamental principles of humanitarian law.''
   The Red Cross ``vigorously protests against this latest tragic
incident during which troops opened fire without discrimination and
without restraint,'' the agency said.
   The Arabs were killed Thursday during a pre-dawn raid on the
West Bank village of Nahalin by Israeli forces. The ICRC statement
said 30 also were wounded.
   The ICRC, a neutral body that monitors compliance with
international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Conventions,
also expressed concern about increasingly frequent use of firearms
and physical violence against ``defenseless civilians.''
   The ICRC, though usually discreet, has repeatedly issued public
criticism of Israel's handling of the 16-month Palestinian uprising
in the occupied territories.

   Congressional approval of a compromise $49.7
million package of non-military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels gives
President Bush bipartisan support to pressure the Sandinista
government into keeping its promises on instituting democratic
reforms, lawmakers say.
   ``I think we've made a step in the right direction,'' Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Thursday moments after the
Senate voted 89-9 to approve the plan. ``Now we can be an active
player in that part of the world.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who hammered out the plan
with Senate and House leaders, has said the history of disagreement
between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Republican White
House over Central America has hamstrung U.S. policy toward the
region.
   The accord provides ``an opportunity to put behind us one of the
most divisive foreign policy issues in post-war history and embark
on a new, more hopeful diplomacy toward Central America,'' Baker
said earlier in the week.
   The overwhelming Senate vote came Thursday night, just a few
hours after the House passed the plan by a similarly decisive
margin, 309-110. House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas said the
legislation ``sets in motion a united, single-voice policy.''
   In Nicaragua on Thursday, the ruling Sandinista party condemned
the Contra aid package, saying it threatens the Nicaraguan
government and ``makes fun of the will of the Central American
presidents.'' Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega also promised to
push for democratic reforms in his country and moved up elections
by 10 months, to February 1990.
   Despite the strong support on both sides of the aisle in
Congress, the plan had its critics.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of the strongest supporters of the
Contras, attacked the plan as ``little more than seven months of
beans and Band-Aids.'' He objected unsuccessfully to an unusual
feature effectively giving Congress veto power over further aid
after Nov. 30.
   Helms and others conservative senators were upset because Baker
agreed not to spend any money on the Contras after that date if
just one congressional committee withheld consent.
   Helms charged that the agreement amounted to an unconstitutional
legislative veto, and produced a letter he received from former
U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Robert Bork supporting his argument.
   ``Some have defended this arrangement by asserting that, while
it would clearly be illegal if written into a statute, it is all
right as a gentleman's agreement,'' Bork said. ``That observation
in no way alters the fact that constitutional processes are being
circumvented.''
   Bork, a Supreme Court nominee of former President Reagan, was
rejected by the Senate in August 1988.
   The compromise plan represents a truce in the rancorous,
8-year-old fight between the White House and Congress over aid to
the rebels.
   The plan would give the Contras food, clothing and medical
assistance to sustain them through next February. But it would bar
aid for weapons and ammunition to renew the guerrillas' fight
against the government.
   Supporters of the compromise said it would put Nicaragua's
Sandinista leadership under intense international pressure to keep
its promises, permit free national elections next February and
observe other ``deadlines for democracy'' set by agreements among
Central American presidents over the last two years.
   Although the aid package includes money for the Contras through
February, Congress will be given an opportunity in November to
review the situation and halt the aid if it sees fit.
   In debate on the House floor, Republican Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois, a supporter of the agreement, told his colleagues that
what it ``lacks in perfection it makes up in real effective help
for the cause of progress and democracy in Nicaragua and Central
America.''
   ``I wish we could do better but as legislators it's not given to
us to act only when conditions are perfect,'' Michel said.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a longstanding Contra supporter, said
he would go along with the compromise.
   ``I support this bill on the theory that if you can't get
dinner, take a sandwich and keep hope alive,'' Hyde said.
   ``It's a crow sandwich,'' replied Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a
consistent Contra aid opponent.
   ``My problem is that price of crow has gone up. We're paying too
much here to allow the architects of a disastrous Contra policy to
save face.''
   Voting against the measure were Sens. Brock Adams, D-Wash.; Bill
Bradley, D-N.J.; Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.;
Arlen Specter, R-Pa.; and Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo. Not voting were
Sens. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn. and David Durenberger, R-Minn.

   The prosecution rested its case against
defendant Richard Ramirez after a witness said Ramirez displayed
gruesome photographs of a murder victim and boasted: ``There's
blood behind the Night Stalker.''
   The close of the prosecution's case was far ahead of schedule.
   ``We had less actual testimony than we had at the preliminary
hearing, Deputy District Attorney P. Phillip Halpin said outside
court Thursday. He said he had dropped some witnesses in order to
present all of the evidence in 31 days of testimony over two months.
   Ramirez, 29, a drifter from El Paso, Texas, is charged with 13
gruesome murders and 30 related felonies in a string of nighttime
attacks that terrified Southern Californians in the summer of 1985.
   Superior Judge Michael Tynan scheduled the trial to resume May 1
with defense testimony.
   The final prosecution witness was David Laws, a sheriff's deputy
who guarded the defendant in his high-security area of the county
jail for a year and a half.
   Laws said that on Oct. 30, 1986, Ramirez summoned him and showed
him two grisly pictures of a murder victim.
   ``He said, `People come up here and call me a punk, and I show
them the pictures and say, `There's blood behind the Night
Stalker,' and they go away all pale,''' Laws testified.
   He identified one of the pictures he said Ramirez had displayed.
It showed victim Maxine Zazzara, who was stabbed and had her eyes
gouged out.
   Gerald Newbold, a sheriff's deputy who guarded Ramirez shortly
after his Aug. 30, 1985, arrest, testified he saw Ramirez drawing
``666'' and a pentagram, symbols of devil worship, in his own blood
on his cell floor.
   After six months of jury selection, testimony in the nearly
4-year-old case began Jan. 30. By the time the prosecution case
wound up Thursday, Halpin had called 137 witnesses and presented
521 pieces of evidence, including many gruesome photographs of the
Night Stalker victims.
   At one point, the trial was recessed for three weeks when
defense attorney Daniel Hernandez said he was too exhausted by
stress to continue. Another attorney, Ray Clark, was then appointed
to assist him and the trial went on.
   Clark has said the defense case will take two to four weeks. If
the estimate is correct, the trial could wrap up in far less than
the two years jurors had been told to expect.

<HEAD>Insurance Company Executive Imprisoned For Refusing Army Service</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 28-year-old insurance
executive who served with the army in Namibia was sentenced today
to 18 months in prison for refusing to complete his military
service.
   Saul Batzofin is the fourth conscientious objector sent to
prison in the past 13 months. Military service is mandatory for all
able-bodied white men in South Africa.
   Batzofin completed his initial two-year service in the army
seven years ago, but last year he refused to report for a required
call-up camp.
   He said a major factor in his decision was his army service in
the Ovambo region of northern Namibia, where South African troops
were fighting black nationalist guerrillas.
   The army ``does not act in the interests of the people of
Namibia,'' Batzofin said in a statement prior to his trial.
``Residents of Ovamboland were treated with disrespect and
contempt.''
   He also said corpses of slain guerrillas were kicked and put on
public display at army bases, then buried in shallow graves so that
wild animals could dig up the bodies.
   ``My response as a young conscript to incidents of this type was
an absolute horror and abhorrence of war in general,'' Batzofin
said.
   Fighting between guerrillas and security forces in Namibia
flared up again April 1 at the start of U.N.-supervised transition
period that is to end with territory becoming independent of South
Africa.
   Batzofin pleaded guilty, and his attorneys asked the presiding
magistrate to sentence him to community service rather than prison.
   But Magistrate P.H. Bredenkamp said today he had no option,
because the law mandates a prison sentence for all draft resisters
equal to 1{ times the amount of service they still faced.
   Batzofin's company, Liberty Life, has pledged to let him return
to his job as a career development officer when he gets out of jail.
   Last year, David Bruce, 25, and Charles Bester, 18, were
sentenced to six years in prison for refusing to enter the
military. Dr. Ivan Toms, who ran a clinic in a black squatter camp,
was sentenced to 21 months for refusing to report to a call-up camp.
   Batzofin was a member of the End Conscription Campaign, a
nationwide group opposed to mandatory military service that was
banned by the government last year. The organization was critical
of the army's role in Namibia and also in black townships, where
troops have been used to control anti-apartheid unrest.
   In August, Batzofin and 142 other young men publicly stated that
they would refuse military service.
   Batzofin's supporters in the courtroom showered him with yellow
flowers as he was led away by wardens after the sentencing. The
supporters lingered in the chamber and sang ``God Bless Africa'' _
an anti-apartheid anthem _ after the magistrate left.

   A former Wedtech Corp. executive who admitted
stealing millions of dollars from the now-defunct defense
contractor and bribing several public officials could be out of
jail by November, prosecutors say.
   Mario Moreno, a key government witness at the racketeering trial
of ex-Rep. Mario Biaggi, was sentenced at a secret court session
Thursday to 18 months in prison for conspiring to bribe public
officials and other corruption charges.
   Moreno, 47, former vice chairman of Wedtech, could have been
sentenced to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. He has been
in custody since November and will be eligible for parole after
serving two-thirds of his sentence, or one year, authorities said.
   The sentencing by U.S. District Judge Charles E. Stewart was not
announced by prosecutors until after it was completed.
   In two weeks on the witness stand at the Biaggi trial, Moreno
admitted he and three other Wedtech officials paid millions of
dollars in bribes to obtain government contracts for Wedtech.
   Biaggi, 71, was sentenced to eight years in prison in November
after he was convicted of turning Wedtech into a racketeering
enterprise that paid millions in bribes and kickbacks.
   Five co-defendants also were convicted of various charges with
Biaggi, who began serving a prison sentence this week on an
unrelated bribery case.
   In a four-page letter assistant U.S. attorney Edward J.M. Little
sent to Stewart on Tuesday and made public Thursday, the prosecutor
detailed the extent of Moreno's cooperation.
   It said he supplied information that led to the conviction of
Biaggi, Biaggi's son, the former commander of the New York National
Guard, former Bronx Borough President Stanley Simon, former White
House aide Lyn Nofziger, the former head of the Small Business
Administration's New York office, two former Maryland legislators
and several others.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III was investigated but
never charged with any wrongdoing in the Wedtech scandal, although
a special prosecutor criticized Meese's ethical decisions in the
case.
   Two former Meese business associates are slated to go on trial
next week on racketeering charges.

   The latest California condor egg laid at the
San Diego Wild Animal Park is fertile, bringing to four the number
of live eggs produced this year in a captive breeding program
designed to save the dying species.
   Condor keepers declared the egg fertile Wednesday after holding
it up to a high-intensity lamp and detecting a developing embryo,
park spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   The egg, laid Sunday, was the second produced this breeding
season by the condor couple who last year produced Molloko, the
first California condor to be both conceived and born in captivity.
   Hanscom said the first egg should hatch late next week. Both
eggs are being artificially incubated.
   Only 28 California condors are known to exist, and all are in
captivity.

<TEXT>
   A man accused in the savage murder of a
pregnant woman, her husband and their two children was placed on a
suicide watch in an isolation cell following his initial court
appearance.
   Newton Carlton Slawson, 34, remained under 24-hour watch today
in the Hillsborough County Jail after telling a staff pychologist
that he would kill himself at the first opportunity, said jail
commander Maj. Jim Cook.
   At an initial hearing Thursday, Slawson was silent as
Hillsborough County Judge Vincent Giglio read the charges against
him. Slawson is charged with four counts of murder and one count of
manslaughter.
   No arraignment date was set.
   Police said Slawson calmly confessed to the savage slayings of a
onetime coworker, Gerald Wood, 23; his wife Peggy, 21, the fetus
sliced from her womb; and their toddlers, Jennifer, 4, and Glendon,
3.
   Slawson told police he flew into a rage he couldn't control in
the Woods' Tampa apartment Tuesday night, authorities said.
   ``We just don't know why,'' said Deputy Police Chief Tom
DePolis. ``I guess the guy was a walking time bomb.''
   Police said they picked him up about 10 blocks from the Woods'
house and recovered a .357-caliber Magnum pistol and a 6-inch
folding knife from his car.
   Slawson moved to central Florida in November from Concord, N.C.,
according to his uncle William Newton.
   Single and a loner, the construction laborer and warehouseman
took a job at a compost company in eastern Hillsborough County in
February. It was there that he met Wood, a forklift driver.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Appeals Decision Clearing De Benedetti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor has appealed a court decision
clearing financier Carlo De Benedetti of wrongdoing in connection
with Italy's biggest banking scandal in decades, news reports said
today.
   Banco Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private bank, collapsed in
1982 after it was unable to collect $1.3 billion in loans made to
10 dummy companies in Latin America. The loans were issued after
letters of assurance were received from the Vatican bank.
   De Benedetti was notified in 1987 he was under investigation for
possible extortion in connection with his sale of Banco Ambrosiano
shares shortly before it went bankrupt. Last week, two Milan
magistrates indicted 35 people in connection with their
investigation of the scandal. They cleared De Benedetti of any
wrongdoing in connection with the bank failure.
   De Benedetti's economic empire includes the Olivetti computer
group and Mondadori, one of Italy's giant publishing houses.
   Italian news agencies and state television said prosecutor Pier
Luigi Dell'Osso disagreed with the magistrates' conclusion about De
Benedetti and had asked the Court of Appeals to indict the
financier for alleged extortion of Roberto Calvi, the Banco
Ambrosiano chairman whose body was found hanging from a London
bridge in 1982. A court ruled in January that Calvi was murdered.
   De Benedetti was vice chairman of the bank for 65 days when
Calvi was chairman.
   Last week, De Benedetti said he was satisfied because he had
always ``acted in the full respect of the law.''
   Those indicted last week included Licio Gelli, a financier who
was charged with complicity in fraudulent bankruptcy. Gelli has
been accused in other investigations of masterminding a ring of
right-wing terrorists.
   He was grandmaster of a secret lodge that investigators linked
to a plot to topple the government.

   Federal drug and perjury charges against a
friend of Mayor Marion Barry Jr. are prompting critics to raise new
questions about the mayor's ability to lead the city's anti-drug
war.
   Charles Lewis, 48, a former city employee, was charged in a
10-count indictment Thursday with lying to a grand jury seven times
about whether he used, bought, shared or offered to sell cocaine.
He also faces three counts of cocaine possession.
   It is the second time in five years that an associate of the
mayor's has faced drug charges.
   ``It heightens the circumstantial perception that there's more
there than we've been told,'' said Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., an
outspoken critic of the Barry administration. ``When do you reach
the point where you can conclude that where there's smoke, there's
fire?''
   One of the perjury charges alleges that Lewis lied about whether
he possessed cocaine on Dec. 22, a day that Barry has acknowledged
visiting Lewis' hotel room at a Ramada Inn in the city.
   ``What was the mayor doing with Mr. Lewis?'' asked council
chairman David Clarke.
   Lewis also is charged with lying about whether he bought or used
drugs with two companions on Dec. 21, a day on which Barry
reportedly visited his room twice.
   The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Jay B. Stephens,
stressed that the indictment does not accuse the mayor or anyone
but Lewis of wrongdoing.
   But one top city official who spoke only on condition of
anonymity said, ``I wouldn't rest easily if I were the mayor.
Stephens made clear he isn't done _ which could mean a lot more can
happen.''
   Lewis' indictment marks the second time Barry's reputation has
been clouded by charges that his friends use drugs. In 1984,
convicted cocaine dealer Karen Johnson spent 11 months in jail on
contempt charges after she refused to tell a grand jury whether she
used drugs with Barry and other top city officials.
   Barry, who is married, acknowledged having a ``personal
relationship'' with Johnson, but denied using drugs with her.
   The Lewis indictment, which comes as Barry is struggling to slow
a drug-fueled record murder rate, threatens to further undermine
the mayor's leadership and credibility on drug issues.
   The mayor's attorney, Kenneth Mundy, said of the indictment:
``It does not refer to any allegedly perjurious statements by Mr.
Lewis to the grand jury which involve the mayor.'' Mundy said that
left the message that ``the mayor's conduct, whatever else it might
have been, was nothing criminal.''
   Mundy also confirmed that he had met with Barry on Thursday, but
declined to discuss their conversation.
   Barry has repeatedly asserted that Lewis never used drugs in his
presence.
   The U.S. attorney's office began its probe Dec. 22 when city
police officers were called off an attempt to make an undercover
drug purchase from Lewis after Barry showed up at his hotel room.
   Stephens said the investigation has cleared police of any
misconduct but continues to focus on the Ramada Inn episode and
other related events, including a $260,000 joint personnel project
involving the city and Virgin Islands governments. Lewis was fired
from the project a year ago amid concerns about cost overruns.
   Although Lewis checked out of his hotel room Dec. 23, before
police could search it or officially link traces of cocaine found
in the room to him, Stephens said investigators may have gathered
physical evidence that will stand up in court.
   Barry, who found out about the indictment while testifying on
the city's drug problem before a House panel, refused to comment.
   If convicted, Lewis faces a five-year maximum penalty on each
perjury charge, plus up to one year for each cocaine possession
charge. Lewis is already under indictment in the Virgin Islands.
   He is awaiting trial there on April 17 on two counts of
possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute
after he allegedly tried to sell crack cocaine to an undercover FBI
agent.

<HEAD>1,400 People Evacuated After Mystery Odor Fells 19 At Student Musical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,400 people were evacuated
from an auditorium after spectators and performers at a student
musical became ill from an unidentified odor, authorities said
today.
   Officials said 19 young people were taken to four hospitals
following the incident late Thursday at Santa Monica Civic
Auditorium. No one was injured seriously.
   The stricken children _ most in their early teens or younger _
complained of dizziness, nausea, chest pains and difficulty
breathing, authorities said.
   Firefighters who searched the arena in this seaside community 20
miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles could not find any source
for the mysterious odor, said Fire Department dispatcher Mike
Shields.
   Police Lt. Roy McGinnis said school officials were to conduct a
more detailed inspection today.
   People began to feel ill about 9 p.m. as a musical titled
``Stairway of the Stars'' was under way in the sprawling arena,
authorities said.
   ``A few girls fainted during a performance. They allege it was
paint fumes, but there was no painting going on inside the
building,'' said auditorium employee Bobbie Burnett. ``Then others
got sick. It was like a chain reaction.''
   Students from several local schools were taking part in the
event.

   Thousands of right-wing war veterans,
some scrawling anti-communist slogans with their own blood,
demonstrated today against a dissident cleric who visited North
Korea for reunification talks.
   About 2,000 radical students supporting the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan
battled riot police with firebombs and rocks at five college
campuses in the capital today for a second day. Police said there
were some injuries and arrests but had no figures.
   About 10,000 veterans and supporters staged a mostly peaceful
march to the presidential mansion to call for the punishment of
Moon, who was arrested Thursday after returning from communist
North Korea. The protesters demanded dissident groups be disbanded
and their members jailed.
   Protesters chanted ``Destroy communists!'' and ``Execute the
Moon Ik-hwan clique!'' before riot police turned them away several
blocks from the mansion. Some marchers, including a few in
wheelchairs, attempted to force their way past police but were
stopped.
   At a rally before the march, cheering veterans burned large
effigies of Moon embracing North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. Some
enraged veterans cut their fingers and drew anti-communist slogans
with their blood as the crowd cheered.
   Many of the protesters were elderly veterans of the Korean War
that ended in 1953, but younger veterans from the Vietnam War also
took part. South Korea sent troops to Vietnam to support the United
States and South Vietnam.
   Police earlier arrested about 60 members of right-wing youth
groups who briefly occupied the Seoul offices of the country's main
dissident movement, the United National Democratic Movement, to
protest Moon's visit to the north.
   Student leaders demanded the release of Moon and other jailed
dissident leaders and called for the overthrow of President Roh
Tae-woo. The student protests today were smaller than violent
clashes Thursday involving at least 10,000 students in five cities.
   North Korea today condemned Moon's arrest and said it
constituted ``a vicious challenge to human rights, democracy and
the peaceful reunification of the nation.'' The government's
statement was carried by the Korean Central News Agency and
monitored in Tokyo.
   Despite the controversy over Moon, South Korean officials said
today they will attend an inter-Korea sports meeting Tuesday in the
border town of Panmunjom. National Unification Minister Lee
Hong-koo said the meeting, the third since March 9, is aimed at
forming a single delegation to the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing,
China.
   Moon created a major political controversy in the South by
making a secret visit to North Korea last month to meet with
communist leader Kim to discuss ways to reunite the Korean
peninsula.
   Moon and a companion were arrested Thursday after landing in
Seoul. The 71-year-old dissident was charged with being a North
Korean agent _ a charge that could carry the death penalty if he is
found guilty.
   Police today arrested Im Jae-kyung, vice president of the
opposition Hankyoreh newspaper, for trying to arrange a trip to
North Korea to interview Kim, officials said. Police earlier
arrested one of the paper's editorial writers who wanted to visit
the north to meet Kim, police said.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of the
peninsula at the end of the Second World War. North Korea invaded
the south in 1950 at the start of the bloody Korean War, which
ended in 1953.

   A gene that is thought to be responsible for
the development of colon cancer has been identified by researchers.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, researchers
from Maryland, Texas and Utah reported that a gene called p53 tends
to be found in a mutated form in colon cancer tumors.
   The discovery eventually could lead to specific tests to detect
the disease before other symptoms occur and while the cancer is
still curable, the study said.
   The researchers said they also found that almost all colon
cancers lose additional genetic material as the tumors progress.
   ``Several genetic changes are probably required for the
development of these cancers,'' said Bert Vogelstein, an associate
professor at Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore.
   The report said that 53 of 56 colon tumors excised by surgery
and analyzed showed the loss of genetic material and that patients
with the most genetic changes were those most likely to experience
a return of their colon cancer.
   The study said the p53 gene is a suppressor gene that can
inhibit tumor growth. Normal cells have two such genes. Colon
cancer cells, however, have no normal copies of the gene. One copy
is lost and the other is mutated.
   Studies suggest that mutation of suppressor genes remove part of
the body's resistance to tumor growth.
   Colon cancer is diagnosed in 147,000 people a year in the United
States, and about 61,000 die of the disease. It ranks second in
frequency and death among the types of cancers.
   The research for the report was performed at Johns Hopkins, the
University of Utah, and at M.D. Anderson Hospital and the Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advance of Science.

<HEAD>Official For Defunct Minnesota Military Contractor Accused Of Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of a defunct military
contractor has been accused of defrauding the Army by providing
inferior parts for M-16 rifles and other weapons.
   Douglas W. Mordal, formerly a supervisor at J.C. Manufacturing
Inc. in surburban Spring Lake Park, is charged in a federal
complaint filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in St. Paul.
   Mordal is accused of using inferior and softer metals and
testing procedures to fill seven orders of parts for M-16s, M-60
machine guns and M-203 grenade launchers.
   Some gun experts say that rifle and gun bolts manufactured with
softer steel are subject to backfiring or jamming. They're also
subject to faster wear.
   The contracts, filled between January 1983 and March 1987, were
worth a total of more than $2.2 million.
   The complaint says Mordal is scheduled to plead guilty Wednesday
before federal Judge Robert Renner.
   Mordal's attorney, Joseph Friedberg, declined to comment. Mordal
did not immediately return a telephone message left today at his
home in surburban Elk River.
   Joseph Walbran, an assistant U.S. attorney handling the case,
said the charges against Mordal are ``an event in a continuing
investigation.'' He declined to say whether other company officials
will be charged.
   The company is alleged to have sold the weapons parts
fraudulently by using a softer alloy steel than call for in their
contracts with the U.S. Armament Munitions and Chemical Command.
   Experts on guns asked to explain the possible effect of using
softer metals said it could cause problems, the Star Tribune
reported today.
   Wade Hanson, a salesman for Burger Brothers Sporting Goods in
Bloomington, said weapons made parts of with softer metals may be
subject to a dangerous ``blowback'' effect that could send the
shell backward.
   J.C. Manufacturing, formed in 1973, filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 in October 1986. It filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy in January.

   The next launch of space shuttle
Atlantis could be scheduled for the end of the month if NASA
officials turn up no problems during today's flight readiness
review.
   A launch date announcement was expected late this afternoon at
the conclusion of the review, which assesses all aspects of the
mission.
   The target date for several weeks has been April 28, but
officials admit that the schedule is tight and could decide to
delay the launch a day or two.
   Directing the review is shuttle chief Richard Truly, nominated
Wednesday by President Bush to be head of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   Astronaut Dave Walker will command Atlantis' crew of five. The
others are pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Mary Cleave,
Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   The astronauts are to release the $378 million Magellan
spacecraft on the start of a 466-day journey to Venus. Magellan is
to orbit Venus and map its cloud-covered surface with
high-resolution radar.

   The nation's radio talkmasters, who discovered
their clout in the drive to kill the congressional pay raise, will
meet in June to do what they do best _ talk, and organize their
budding political power.
   ``What we're going to do is see what things we all have in
common and try to get people to participate at the appropriate
moment,'' said Boston's Jerry Williams of WRKO, an old hand at
generating a public furor via the airwaves and the host of the
conference here.
   ``A good many people who listen to talk radio feel frustrated
that they never knew what to do'' in responding to issues, Williams
said in a recent interview. ``We just lead them down the path,
(telling them) here are the principles.''
   Beginning June 9, Williams will have most of the visiting talk
show hosts on his afternoon program. Among those expected to attend
are Michael Siegel of KING in Seattle, Roy Fox of KFYI in Phoenix,
Tom Leykis of KFI in Los Angeles, Al Rantel of WNWS in Miami, and
former Philadelphia Mayor Frank Rizzo, now a talk show host on WCAU
in Philadelphia.
   Radio hosts have long used the airwaves to stir up interest in
local issues, but last February they took the technique nationwide.
   Led by talk show hosts, listeners flooded Congress with a
torrent of tea bags bearing the message ``Read my tea bag: no 50
percent raise.'' The public pressure helped quash a salary hike for
congressmen, judges and others on the federal payroll.
   Now, Siegel, in Seattle, is trying to generate national interest
in a campaign to boycott Exxon to protest its response to the Exxon
Valdez oil spill. He has been interviewed on other radio stations
around the country and says he is receiving 200 letters a day, many
containing demolished Exxon credit cards.
   The entertainment media have gone far in the past year with the
radio talk show host. The 1988 film ``Talk Radio'' depicted a
badgering Texas talk show host and the televsion series ``Midnight
Caller'' features on an ex-cop who uses the airwaves to fight crime.
   The talk show hosts have loosely formed a federation but, as
yet, it has no name. Williams is considering ``Vox Pop,'' short for
the Latin phrase vox populi, or voice of the people.
   Williams and other radio hosts say they are lobbyists for their
listeners.
   But others see them as demagogues who gloss over the
complexities of issues and sell a largely conservative brand of
conventional wisdom to their audiences.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., a supporter of the pay-raise bill,
spoke out against the radio-driven pressure against the measure.
``We became cartoon cannon fodder for trash televison and for talk
radio,'' Fazio said from the House floor. ``We fell prey to the
deception of the rabble rousers.''
   ``I'm a little bit concerned that the local disc jockeys and
talk show hosts are using serious national issues for
audience-building,'' said James H. Quello, a member of the Federal
Communications Commission. ``Some of them remind me of college
sophomores at a rally.''
   For sophomores, the radio hosts make good money. A host in a
major market can easily make more than $100,000 a year and
sometimes much more, according to Phoenix radio host Barry Young.
   And they can be worth that to their stations. In a random
sampling, talk shows on three AM stations rated by The Arbitron Co.
all increased their market share by last fall compared to the
previous year. In less than a year in 1988 the Jerry Williams Show
went from a 7.9 percent share to a 9.3 percent share.
   Murry Levin, a political science professor at Boston University
and author of ``Talk Radio and the American Dream,'' listened to
700 hours of local talk radio programing and is convinced of its
power.
   Talk radio, he said, ``is the only medium that provides an
outlet for working-class people.''
   Siegel, despite his success in getting support on the oil spill
issue, says the audience, not the host, sets the agenda. ``We don't
have control over these people.''

<HEAD>Federal Investigation of Former Boston Mayor Reportedly Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 10-year federal investigation of former Mayor
Kevin H. White's conduct in office and personal finances has ended,
a newspaper reported.
   The Boston Globe, citing unidentified sources, said in today's
editions that the U.S. attorney's office has sent a letter to White
telling him the investigation is finished. White, who served as
mayor for 16 years until 1984, was never charged with wrongdoing.
   The investigation into allegations of political corruption in
City Hall resulted in the indictment and conviction of at least 23
former city officials and several businessmen.
   ``It was the largest and most intense investigation in history,
short of a political assassination,'' White's lawyer, Thomas E.
Dwyer Jr., said earlier.
   The Globe said Dwyer would not comment except to say he is
confident White can now examine his personal records that were
locked up at the Boston Public Library during the investigation.
   ``Neither Mayor White nor myself desires to comment on the
status of any matter,'' Dwyer said.
   White did not return a call from the Globe seeking comment. In
the past, he has said he had nothing to hide from the investigation.
   Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, who stepped down March 31 as acting U.S.
attorney for Massachusetts, confirmed that before leaving office he
sent a letter to Dwyer at the former mayor's request.
   But O'Sullivan would not discuss the details, and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ralph Gants, who heads the office's political corruption
unit, declined to comment.

   Opponents said the bill approved Thursday would not deter the
use of powerful weapons in crimes and could interfere with citizens
and hunters.
   And it could face opposition in the Senate, where the chairman
of the Judiciary Committee suggested an alternative that would
require owners of assault rifles to register with police.
   Several representatives said the legislation was a reaction to
the shooting deaths of five Stockton, Calif., schoolchildren in
January.
   ``It's not a Stockton-related issue,'' said Democratic Rep.
Nicholas Tsiongas. ``We have a very aggresive and violent society
and that's why we had problems with guns.''
   ``I don't think it's going to deter crime,'' said Rep. Michael
Zanni, also a Democrat. ``A number of these weapons that are
mentioned are very expensive hunting rifles.''
   The House legislation passed 63-30 after nearly two hours of
debate.
   House members approved on a 70-18 vote a measure extending the
waiting period on handguns from 72 hours to one week and
implementing a one-week waiting period on shotguns and rifles.
   A gun control bill is pending in the Senate, but no vote has
been planned.
   Meanwhile, in Michigan, a bill was introduced in the Legislature
on Thursday to regulate the sale of semiautomatic weapons,
including assault rifles.
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Nick Smith, a Republican, said it would
keep the weapons away from criminals while protecting the rights of
private citizens.
   The measure drew support from the state sheriffs association,
but was opposed by a representative of the National Rifle
Association.

<HEAD>Government Body Calls For Review Of 1950s Show Trials In Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government advisory body has called
for a review of the show trial of former Premier Imre Nagy, who was
executed in 1958, the state news agency MTI reported.
   Meanwhile, the government daily Magyar Hirlap reported today
that Premier Miklos Nemeth plans to reshuffle the government next
month.
   Nagy, a critic of the Soviet Union, was ousted and arrested in
1956 after Soviet soldiers and tanks crushed a revolt that demanded
Red Army forces leave Hungary. He was executed on charges of
``conspiracy and creating a secret organization aimed at forcibly
seizing power and overthrowing the Hungarian People's Democracy.''
   The decision to reassess Nagy's and other Stalinist show trials
of the 1950s is widely seen as the first step toward Nagy's
rehabilitation, which is being demanded by several independent
political groups in Hungary.
   Political rehabilitation would involve Communist Party officials
saying it was a mistake to try him and that he was an honest man.
   But Communist Party chief Karoly Grosz recently ruled out Nagy's
political rehabilitation, saying that during the 1956 revolution he
made ``too many mistakes.''
   A purely legal rehabilitation would be a different matter, Grosz
added. Under that form of rehabilitation, judicial authorities
would say that a person convicted on a given charge should not have
been convicted.
   The bodies of Nagy and four of his associates have been exhumed
from their unmarked graves in recent weeks. The government has
given permission for a funeral to bury Nagy's remains June 16, the
31st anniversary of his execution.
   Acting on information from Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar, the
advisory body said judicial authorities should look into the Nagy
trial in line with an earlier government resolution to review the
show trials.
   ``They want the review to be thorough, but done as fast as
possible so that a satisfactory general solution can be found after
the examination of other trials conducted in the same period,'' MTI
reported Thursday.
   It said the body would welcome a decision to review the penal
code regarding anti-state offenses and would propose abolition of
capital punishment in such cases.
   The abolition of capital punishment for anti-state crimes would
pave the way for the summary rehabilitation of the revolutionary
leaders.
   Nemeth's plans to reshuffle the government follow Wednesday's
top-level changes in the Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
   ``A necessary harmony in outlook and unity of action was
missing'' in government in recent months, Nemeth was quoted as
saying in Magyar Hirlap. ``This situation cannot continue any
longer.''
   Nemeth did not mention any names with the exception of Minister
of Health and Social Care Judit Csehak, who had asked not to be
renominated for Politburo membership Wednesday.

   A pair of toy pistols grounded three international
flights and hundreds of passengers when officials at Logan
International Airport decided to err on the side of caution.
   Officials halted flights for several hours after a security
agent checking hand luggage and passengers Thursday night spotted
two guns among the bags moving through her X-ray machine.
   When the agent looked up, she thought she saw someone take the
handbag and run into the crowded concourse, Phil Orlandella,
spokesman for the airport, said.
   ``We went into an emergency procedure and sealed off the area,''
Orlandella said. ``Better safe than sorry.''
   A British Airways 747 carrying 356 passengers was backing away
from the gate at about 9:15 p.m. when the pilot was signaled to
return.
   ``We decided we would take the conservative approach,'' said
Denis Campbell, an assistant manager for the airline.
   Campbell said passengers were asked to deplane and undergo a
security check a second time. The check turned up two toy guns in a
cellophane-covered package that a 12-year-old girl had carried onto
the plane in her bag.
   Orlandella said the security agent who spotted the suspicious
items was asked to try to identify the woman she thought had made
off with the bag.
   The agent at one point identified a passenger on the British
Airways flight, but a second security check of the woman and her
traveling companions revealed nothing, he said.
   ``But we decided she could have passed the guns on to somebody
else, so we ran the whole group through again,'' Orlandella said.
``We also checked the whole aircraft from front to back and side to
side.''
   Orlandella said Air France and Swissair also had a jumbo jet
each held back but that all three flights had departed by 11:30 p.m.

<HEAD>Man in Courtroom Says He Has Bomb and Demands To See Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two sheriff's officers were praised for
tackling a man in a courtroom and seizing what was believed to be
an explosive device after the man said he had a bomb and demanded
to speak to President Bush.
   The incident occurred Thursday when James Cecil, 36, of
Lakewood, faced a judge on firearms charges.
   When Cecil suddenly announced he had a bomb and wanted to speak
to Bush, who was visiting a school about 7 miles away, Union County
sheriff's officer Charles Marchese tackled him and officer Ronnie
Malcolm seized his briefcase, said Union County Sheriff Ralph G.
Froelich.
   Froelich said Malcolm didn't believe the man had a bomb until he
opened the briefcase and saw what appeared to be an electronic
explosive device.
   ``Instead of panicking and dropping it, he slowly moved over and
walked into an adjoining room with solid concrete walls, risking
his own life,'' Froelich said. ``I'm very proud of the way they
conducted themselves.''
   The device in the briefcase was ``a suspicious device; they're
not classifying it as a bomb,'' said county police Sgt. Anthony
Reilly.
   Cecil also claimed he had planted other bombs in the building,
which houses the county administration and Superior Court, said Ed
Tucker, first assistant prosecutor for Elizabeth.
   Bomb-sniffing dogs and 40 police officers searched for other
explosives in the building for five hours, but none was found, said
county police officer Ellen Merino. There were no injuries, she
said.
   Cecil was being held today in the Union County Jail facing
charges of assault and terroristic threats. Froelich said
additional charges were expected.
   The incident took place in the third-floor courtroom of Superior
Judge Leonard Sachar at about 1:30 p.m. Bush gave a speech Thursday
at Union High School and left Newark International Airport at 2:32
p.m.
   Cecil ``freaked out and said `I have a bomb here,' or something
to that effect, and everybody started scrambling,'' Tucker said.

   Dale D. Myers, the acting administrator of
NASA and one of the men brought back to the agency following the
Challenger accident, is resigning on May 13, officials announced
today.
   Myers, 67, became acting administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration last week following the
resignation of administrator James C. Fletcher.
   Richard Truly, chief of NASA space flight program, is nominated
by President Bush to become administrator, but has not yet been
confirmed by the Senate.
   Bush announced Wednesday that he plans to nominate J.R.
Thompson, head of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala., to succeed Myers as deputy administrator.
   Myers has served two tours in NASA's headquarters office. He was
associate administrator for manned space flight from 1970 to 1974,
an era that included much of the Apollo moon landing program.
   From 1977 to 1979, Myers served as under secretary of the
Department of Energy.
   President Reagan persuaded both Myers and Fletcher to return to
NASA in the wake of the Jan. 28, 1986 Challenger accident. They
reorganized the NASA management structure and directed the program
that corrected problems on the space shuttle and enabled the
spacecraft to resume flights.
   Myers was awarded distinguished service medals by both NASA and
the Department of Energy, and he is a member of the National
Academy of Engineering.

<TEXT>
   A huge convoy carrying much-needed
food and fuel to Kabul broke through a guerrilla blockade along a
major supply route today.
   The convoy of up to 100 trucks and tanks pushed down the Salang
Highway running south from the Soviet border to the capital. The
strategic road, 260 miles long, has been closed for a week by
Moslem insurgents.
   The guerrillas are hoping to starve the capital until it
surrenders.
   As the convoy moved down the highway, soldiers fired from tanks
and machine gun posts into the surrounding mountains where the
insurgents are hiding.
   The firing continued for nearly two hours, with thick black
smoke billowing from the hills about six to 10 miles away.
Helicopter gunships provided protection for the convoy. Several
trucks appeared to have been damaged and one truck was carrying
several wounded men.
   A second military convoy moved out of the capital overnight and
down another vital road used to carry supples to the city of 2.25
million people, diplomats said. Government soldiers have been
trying to clear the road to the besieged city of Jalalabad. The
road has been closed to routine traffic for nearly two weeks. The
guerrillas said they control about 20 miles of the highway, the
major route to the border with Pakistan.
   One diplomat said the guerrillas had seized a convoy of empty
trucks returning to Jalalabad, parked them along the road and then
placed mines inside.
   The Soviet Union has been airlifting food and military equipment
to Kabul to help the government of President Najib hold out against
the rebels.
   Supplies also are being airlifted into the strategically
important cities of Jalalabad and Khost, said one senior Soviet
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The diplomats said the Salang Highway had been cut by rebel
commander Ahmad Shah Masood and his Jamiat-i-Islami group, which
has struck deals in the past with the pro-Soviet government to
allow some convoys through.
   The guerrillas have made blockades a primary tactic in their
fight to overthrow the Marxist government that seized power in an
April 1978 coup.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said Thursday
that also said fighting had eased around Jalalabad, a provincial
capital 70 miles east of Kabul.
   He added, however, that fierce fighting continued near the
southern towns of Khost and Ghazni.
   Amani said six government soldiers died while beating back
guerrillas on three fronts around Khost. At least 185 guerrillas
were killed, he said.
   The Moslem insurgents based in Pakistan and supported by the
United States, Saudi Arabia and China launched their offensive
around Jalalabad on March 6 but have not succeeded in dislodging
government troops.
   The Soviet source said about 2,000 government troops had died
since the guerrillas began bombarding the city with tens of
thousands of rockets. He said 8,000 rebels had been killed in
retaliatory strikes.
   He did not know how many civilians have died in the siege.
   The Afghan armed forces are equipped with sophisticated weapons
from the Soviet Union.
   ``They can have the hardware at our disposal in any numbers they
want,'' the official said. ``Jalalabad must be held. It will be
held.''
   Soviet officials have denied Moscow sent arms since the troop
pullout but that Soviet weapons left are not affected by the Geneva
accord, which prohibits any outside interference.
   Still, the Soviets have continued to supply President Najib's
army with weapons, including long-range Scud-B missiles now used by
government troops against the guerrillas besieging Jalalabad.
   In New Delhi, Afghanistan's ambassador today accused Washington
of violating the accord by arming the guerrillas.
   ``The Geneva Accord is fully implemented by Afghanistan and the
Soviet Union, but unfortunately the other parties concerned have
not implemented it and the situation has gotten more tense than
ever before,'' Abdul Samad Azhar told reporters.
   If Jalalabad falls, it would be the largest city captured by the
rebels in the decade-long civil war and would give them a base to
set up their interim government formed in February in Pakistan.
   The Soviet military forces completed their withdrawal from
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, ending more than nine years of direct
involvement in the civil war.

<HEAD>Simplified Health Rules Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most members of the House Ways and Means
Committee are sponsoring a bill by Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., to simplify rules that prohibit employer-financed health
insurance plans from discriminating against lower-paid workers.
   The rules, aimed at encouraging extension of medical insurance
to a greater number of employees, were enacted as part of the 1986
tax overhaul. They have been assailed widely on grounds they impose
a heavy burden of paperwork on employers; some businesses say the
rules are so onerous that they have threatened to drop all employee
health insurance.
   ``It is my hope that recordkeeping and data collection
requirements of employers, particularly small employers, will be
significantly reduced,'' Rostenkowski said in introducing his
modification bill Thursday.
   Although he remains firmly committed to seeing that higher-paid
employees do not get a disproportionate share of benefits,
Rostenkowski said, those requirements ``should not be so
administratively burdensome on small or late employers that they
discourage the establishment and maintenance of fringe-benefit
programs for broad classes of employees.''
   The disputed rules generally require employers to conduct
detailed, complicated tests to determine whether their
fringe-benefit plans, principally health insurance, discriminate
against those making less than $50,000 a year.
   The rules went into effect on Jan. 1 but the Internal Revenue
Service waived them until July 1 and agreed that no employer would
be penalized if a good-faith effort to follow the rules were made
the remainder of 1989.
   Rostenkowski's bill stops short of repealing the rules, which
are known by their location in the tax code, Section 89. Many
members of Congress have endorsed repeal.
   Under Rostenkowski's bill, employers that provide a health plan
would have to offer coverage costing workers $10 a week or less
($25 or less for a family plan) to 90 percent of employees.
Higher-paid workers would be taxed on the value of coverage that
was better than provided other employees.
   The bill is being sponsored by 28 members of Ways and Means,
including all Democrats on the panel.

   More than 200 paintings and sculptures, many
never before exhibited and only recently rescued from decades of
neglect, have gone on display in a show that encompasses 164 years
of American art.
   The show, which opened today in Manhattan before beginning a
seven-city national tour, is composed almost entirely of works
donated by the artists to the National Academy of Design as a
requirement for membership.
   ``It's interesting, because our artists choose differently than
curators would choose,'' said John Dobkin, director of the Academy.
``These are works I would hope that the artists feel very strongly
about.''
   The Academy was formed in 1825 by a group of artists as a
school, rather than a museum, ``to elevate the character and
condition of the arts of design in our country.''
   From the beginning, artists were required to submit a
self-portrait or other likeness upon their election as an associate
member, and an example of their work upon induction as an
academician.
   ``The artists have been remarkably generous,'' Dobkin said in an
interview Thursday before a preview showing in a Fifth Avenue
mansion donated to the academy in 1940.
   But as the collection grew over the years, the academy was
unable to keep up with it.
   Dobkin said that when he became director in 1978, ``the storage
facility was so inadequate and the conditions for the paintings
were so lamentable that scholars hadn't been able to look at the
collection for years.''
   Funds were solicited from such sources as the National Endowment
for the Arts and the New York State Council for the Arts.
   ``And now we have felt ready after being in business since 1825
to have this large exhibition,'' Dobkin said.
   About half of the more than 150 paintings and 50 sculptures
chosen from the 2,000-item collection have never before been on
public exhibition.
   Included in the show are works by such artists as Thomas Eakins,
Winslow Homer, William Merritt Chase, Philip Pearlstein and
Alexander Stirling Calder, whose son, also named Alexander, is a
famous abstract sculptor of mobiles and stabiles.
   Dobkin estimated the total collection to be worth hundreds of
millions of dollars.
   No attempts were made to organize the show chronologically or by
style, which can make for somewhat jarring juxtapositions. Muted
pastoral scenes are hung next to bold abstracts; a study of a row
of 1950s-style cars is across the room from tiny portraits and
still-lifes.
   ``They aren't all masterpieces by any means,'' Dobkin admits.
But he adds, the artists ``gave these pieces and these are the
pieces they wanted their fellow artists to judge them by.''

      The show will go on the road later this year through 1992 with
stops in Nashville, Tenn.; Raleigh, N.C.; Atlanta; Santa Clara,
Calif.; Chicago; St. Louis and Denver.

   Three bombs exploded today at
the house of Vice President-elect Francisco Merino, injuring one
child and causing extensive damage, authorities said.
   Merino and his wife, Maria Antonieta, were visiting in the
United States and were not present at their home in the affluent
Maquilishuat neighborhood of San Salvador when the house was
attacked at dawn.
   The couple's four young children and three friends were asleep
in the house when four bombs were thrown over the wall surrounding
the garden.
   One bomb did not explode, and experts later defused the device.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   But President-elect Alfredo Cristiani, who visited Merino's
house shortly after the attack, blamed the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, a leftist rebel organization that has waged a
civil war against the U.S.-backed government for the last nine
years.
   Cristiani told reporters the attack ``demonstrates that they
(the guerrillas) are savages, who are not interested in peace, but
only in terrorizing the civilian population. I think very little
can be achieved, as far as pacifying the country, through dialogue
with these kind of people.''
   The master bedroom and dining room were heavily damaged by the
blasts.
   Cristiani said one of the friends visiting the Merino children
suffered cuts from the explosions. He described the injuries as
slight.
   Cristiani and Merino, both of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, were elected March 19 and are due to take
office June 1 from President Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian
Democratic administration.
   Merino was due back in El Salvador later today.

   Baker told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the
risk to the Soviet leader could come from opponents of change,
entrenched elements of the bureaucracy and from ``sources of
nationalistic discontent.''
   He said Gorbachev's economic program, known in Russian as
perestroika, is in the best interest of the United States and the
world because it would lead to a more secure and stable Soviet
Union.
   ``We very much want perestroika to succeed,'' Baker said in
response to a question after a speech. ``We very much want the
General Secretary to succeed.''
   But, Baker said, political reform in the Soviet Union is
proceeding faster than economic reform. ``That might trigger
something,'' he said. ``These things generally have to proceed
apace.''
   Baker, due to meet with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow May 10-11, said ``there is some
risk'' to the Soviet leadership.
   ``If they are unable to get the economic part of this going and
going well so there are consumer goods on the table and in the
markets, that's going to give rise to some feeling on the part of
some that this idea of perestroika doesn't mean much to the common
man in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Baker added: ``I see a chance of it, and I think it would be
unfortunate.''
   In his speech, the U.S. official mixed praise of Gorbachev with
criticism. He called again for renunciation of the Brezhnev
Doctrine, which asserts Moscow's right to intervene militarily on
the side of East European governments under internal attack, and
for destruction of the Berlin Wall, which divides East and West in
Europe.
   Baker also criticized Soviet military support to Nicaragua and
the sale of new bombers to Libya, which he said supports terrorism.
   ``There remain too many areas where the slogans of new thinking
lack content.'' he said.

   Navy officials have confirmed that two Navy
training jets collided before they crashed, killing two people, but
said the cause of the collision was still being investigated.
   The crash of two T-2C Buckeye jets occurred Thursday about 50
miles north of the Meridian Naval Air Station in rural east-central
Mississippi. Two pilots who ejected suffered only minor injuries.
   The jets are used to train Navy and Marine pilots. One student
and one instructor were aboard each jet.
   The dead were identified as Lt. j.g. Jerome Reese Schuchart, 28,
of Seattle, and Ensign Duane James Hofhine, 23, of Cedarburg, Wis.
Schuchart was Hofhine's flight instructor, said Navy Petty Officer
Dave McBride of the Meridian Naval Air Station.
   The survivors were identified as Lt. Terry Lynn Tuggle of
Aurora, Colo., an instructor, and Ensign Bruce Hart Szymanski of
Fredonia, N.Y., a student.
   Tuggle and Szymanski ejected from their plane as the two
aircraft collided over rural Noxubee County. The two were
hospitalized but later released, McBride said.
   Johnny Spann, who owns a garage off old U.S. Highway 45, heard
one plane crash. ``We seen parachutes and pieces falling,'' he said.
   An ejection seat landed near his garage, and a piece of a jet
hit a house nearby, Spann said. About 30 minutes later two pilots
walked out of the woods.
   ``They had their parachutes all rolled up and everything,'' he
said. ``They looked like they was fine. We offered them a ride.
They said they'd just walk on down.''
   The pilots were picked up by a helicopter after reaching a
crossroad, he said.

   An autopsy on Abbie Hoffman was
inconclusive, but officials hoped toxicology tests would determine
how the 1960s radical died. Friends and family said he had been was
depressed and may have committed suicide.
   Hoffman, 52, was found dead in his bed by his landlord Wednesday
night.
   Kate Fluehr, a spokeswoman for Bucks County District Attorney
Alan Rubenstein, said today that the laboratory tests to find the
cause of death had begun, but the results would come sometime next
week at the earliest.
   Hoffman's mother said at first that the family assumed Hoffman
had taken his life. He sounded very depressed in recent telephone
conversations with his brother, Jack, 83-year-old Florence Hoffman
said Thursday night.
   ``He had to do what he had to do,'' she said from her Worcester,
Mass., home. ``I don't know why. I don't know what happened.''
   But today she said she was encouraged that the initial autopsy
was inconclusive and added, ``It's very possible that he had a
heart attack.''
   Rubenstein said an autopsy performed Thursday night at
Doylestown Hospital failed to uncover the cause of Hoffman's death.
   Mark Broderick, director of student activities at Loyola College
in Baltimore, said he also believed Hoffman sounded depressed when
he called to cancel a speaking engagement hours before he was to
arrive on Tuesday.
   ``He said that his mother was dying, that he really couldn't
leave her,'' Broderick said.
   But Mrs. Hoffman said she had not seen her son in weeks. She
also said she was under treatment for breast cancer but did not
consider the condition terminal.
   Michael Waldron, who rented Hoffman an apartment in a
400-foot-long converted turkey shed in New Hope, said Hoffman was
busy with projects and concerned about the environment through his
last few weeks.
   Hoffman was very upset about the recent oil spill off the coast
of Alaska, and he talked about organizing a boycott of Exxon Corp.,
which is responsible for the massive slick, until the spill was
cleaned up, Waldron said.
   Hoffman rose to prominence with the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals who stood trial on charges of conspiring to disrupt the
1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was acquitted of
conspiracy and a conviction of crossing state lines with intent to
riot was overturned.
   He also founded the loosely organized Yippie movement, or Youth
International Party, in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest
the government and the Vietnam War.
   By his own count, Hoffman was arrested more than 40 times. He
said the government had 67,000 pages of files on him.
   Hoffman, divorced twice, was the father of three children.
   Jack Hoffman said his brother's body would be cremated.
   Formal arrangements were pending, while tentative plans had been
made for memorial services in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts.

   The nation's worst oil spill is provoking boycotts of some Exxon
stations, galvanizing protests from enraged citizens and talk
jockeys, and leading to reports of bomb threats.
   It's also inspiring some slick jokes.
   But the shipload's worth of Exxon-bashing during the past three
weeks isn't funny to some gas station operators, who quickly point
out that the public shouldn't equate them with the giant oil
corporation.
   And many station operators maintain they've witnessed few, if
any, effects of organized efforts against Exxon Corp.
   A Phoenix-based group calling itself Friends of Prince William
Sound _ where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a charted reef
and spilled some 10.1 million gallons of oil _ turned out about 50
marchers on Tuesday outside a Phoenix Exxon station, carrying signs
with slogans such as:
   ``Exxon: sign of the double cross.''
   An estimated 2,000 people held a two-hour rally Wednesday at
Seattle's Alki Beach to protest the oil spill, forcing Seattle
police to close Alki Avenue, the thoroughfare that provides the
only access to the beach.
   Radio station KUBE-FM created and promoted the event. Announcers
Charlie Brown and Ty Flint spent 12 hours broadcasting calls from
the public about the oil spill. Four other radio stations joined in
a simulcast.
   On Thursday, more than 500 people jammed a National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration hearing in Seattle that became a forum
to vent anger over the spill. The public meeting was the last of
four called by the agency to identify issues pertinent to the
establishment of a national marine sanctuary along the Northwest
coast.
   ``I'm heartbroken over what happened in Alaska,'' said John
Church, who pasted up bright red ``Remember Valdez'' signs
throughout the building. ``I used to fish in Cordova, and to see
pictures of those sea otters floating dead in the water is
heartbreaking. I don't want this to happen in Washington.''
   Meantime, Michael Siegal of KING in Seattle is trying to
generate national interest in a boycott against Exxon. He has
appeared on other radio stations around the nation and said he is
receiving 200 letters a day, many with cut-up Exxon credit cards.
   At radio station KARN in Little Rock, Ark., talk show host Pat
Lynch said Thursday that he has had guests on twice this week to
discuss the Alaska spill, and he found listeners were livid.
   ``Listeners are just plain upset and there is, I think, an
unusual sense of rage,'' he said. ``I think it hinges on two
things, one of which is the out and out undisguised greed of price
increases coming at this time, and also the certain knowledge that
the consumer will bear the cost of the Valdez cleanup.''
   In Los Angeles, morning show host Peter Tilden of KLSX-FM, a
rock 'n' roll station, solicited volunteers to help in the cleanup.
   He also asked listeners to slice Exxon credits cards and boycott
the oil company.
   To others in radio and television, the issue has been a laughing
matter.
   ``Exxon sprung into action immediately, and sent in their crack
cleanup crew _ a guy named Raoul with a squeegee and a dirty rag,''
Johnny Carson joked recently on NBC-TV's ``The Tonight Show.''
   He also quipped: ``I don't think Exxon's new slogan helps at
all: `Exxon, we're not as bad as Union Carbide.'''
   But all joking aside, Wayne Konitshek, managing director of the
Colorado Service Station Dealers Association, said three bomb
threats and two protests have been reported at Exxon service
stations since last weekend.
   He said the association is attempting to make the public aware
of the difference between independently owned stations and company
owned stations.
   Independent dealers, he said, ``are as innocent as the otters in
Alaska.''
   Nonetheless, many station operators from Maine to California
said it was business as usual in the wake of the spill. Others
attributed any decline in sales to a recent increase in prices at
the pump.
   Richard Brown, manager of an Exxon station in suburban New
Orleans, said some customers have threatened to stop buying gas in
protest of the oil spill and the rising price of fuel.
   ``But there's really been no decrease in business,'' he added.
   Tom Hamilton, a mechanic at Dave's Bustleton Exxon in
Philadelphia, said some customers have asked about a recent 6 cents
per gallon increase in the price, but none has commented seriously
about the spill.
   ``They say some things about it in jest,'' he said.
   For its part, Exxon responded to two consumer groups' boycott
call earlier this week with a statement issued from its New York
headquarters, reiterating its regret about the oil spill.
   ``All of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that
our effort in Alaska will convince them that we continue to be a
responsible company and one people like to do business with,''
Exxon said.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 14 grafs to UPDATE with coup leaders escaping into
Sudan, Sudanese troopers moved toward border. Pickup 10th graf, ``Itno

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chad's government says it thwarted a rebellion
against President Hissene Habre, and Sudan said the three leaders
of the attempted coup escaped to the neighboring African nation.
   Sudanese soldiers were moved to the border with Chad and were
disarming Chadian troopers who had crossed the border, a Sudanese
official said.
   Chad's government identified the plotters as Hassan Djamous,
commander-in-chief of the armed forces; Idriss Debi, his
predecessor in the post; and Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahamat Itno.
   The government, in a communique released Thursday night through
the Chadian Embassy in Paris, said the coup leaders ``entered into
rebellion against the institutions of the republic'' on the night
of April 1-2.
   The communique said the armed forces were ``ordered to destroy''
the plotters and ``put an end to the rebellion by annihilation.''
   It described the coup leaders as ``individuals motivated and
manipulated by overwhelming ambition.''
   Asked about the fate of the ringleaders, the Chadian Embassy
only would say the plot had been uncovered and its authors and
accomplices rendered harmless.
   Diplomatic sources in N'Djamena, capital of the northern African
nation, said April 5 that Itno was arrested and that Djamous and
Debi had disappeared.
   The sources also said military movements occurred in the capital
the weekend of April 1-3 and that people trying to get in or out of
the city were stopped at roadblocks.
   In a report from N'Djamena, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse quoted unidentified sources as saying Djamous and
Debi were wounded Tuesday in fighting with troops who had pursued
them across the border into Sudan's Darfur province. It said
Djamous was taken prisoner but Debi escaped. In a statement
released Thursday night in Khartoum, the governor of the province,
Tigani Sysi said the Itno, Djamous and Debi crossed into Sudan a
week ago.
   The Sudanese armed forces General Command issued a statement
saying Chadian soldiers had intruded into Darfur and that Sudanese
soldiers were sent there for security and to expel the Chadians.
   The statement gave no number for the Chadian intruders, but a
magazine, Al-Adwaa, said 2,000 Chadian soldiers crossed over
following the coup attempt.
   The Sudanese governor confirmed the presence of Chadian forces
in his region, but said Sudanese troopers were disarming the
Chadian soldiers.
   Itno took a leading role in negotiations which led to the Habre
government's reconciliation with numerous political oppponents who
had been engaged in a drawn out civil war with the government.
   Itno also joined in negotations that led to the 1987 pact with
rebel leader Acheik Ibn Omar, who was appointed foreign minister
earlier this year.
   Habre has ruled Chad since 1982, when he ousted a Libyan-backed
government led by Goukouni Oueddei.
   Libya maintained troops in northern Chad and supported Chadian
factions opposed to Habre until 1987, when a stunning Chadian
military offensive drove the Libyans out.
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's leader, then recognized Habre's
government and agreed to a cease-fire, although a permanent
settlement has proved elusive and occasional clashes have been
reported.
   Habre has tried to unite the many rebellious factions in the
country, sometimes through repression and sometimes by making pacts
that gave the rebel leaders important posts in his government.

<HEAD>Former Charter 77 Spokesman Released</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former spokesman for the Charter
77 human rights group was released from jail today, the state-run
news agency reported.
   CTK quoted the prosecutor's office in Brno, Moravia, as saying
Stanislav Devaty was released because ``the reasons for his
detention have ceased to exist. The investigation on his activity
continues.'' It did not elaborate.
   Devaty reportedly started a hunger strike when he was arrested
March 16 in connection with a petition he organized last fall
calling for freedom for political prisoners. He was not convicted
on any charges, but activists in Prague said authorities planned to
charged him with incitement in connection with the petition.
   The International Helsinki Federation, a Vienna-based group
monitoring human rights in the East bloc, on Tuesday appealed to
the Czechoslovak government to release the activist.
   Devaty, 37, was arrested in Prague and taken to his hometown of
Gottwaldov in Moravia. Fellow Charter 77 signatories said he had
been fasting since his arrest and had been force-fed since Easter.
   An April 8 appeal to the Prague government, signed by 29
Czechoslovak activists, said Devaty ``is capable of total
self-sacrifice.''
   There was no immediate word on Devaty's whereabouts.
   Charter 77 _ the Soviet bloc's oldest, unofficial human rights
organization _ was formed in January 1977. It was named for the
document issued by founding members calling on Czechoslovakia to
respect civil liberties.

   A 900-pound pet pig has been found

distraught owners reported a pignapping.
   Tiffany Marie's owner, Bob Urbanski, said he received an
anonymous phone call late Thursday threatening to harm the pig

   ``He said if we were not there in an hour, Tiffany Marie would

   The 2-year-old spotted sow _ who likes corn chips and strawberry

Chicago.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief of Soviet Georgia
resigned today in an emergency meeting about violent, nationalist
demonstrations in the southern republic, and he was replaced by the
local KGB chief, officials said.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told
reporters in Moscow the Georgian party leader, First Secretary
Dzhumber I. Patiashvili, offered his resignation and the Central
Committee accepted it.
   Givi G. Gumbaridze, 45, who has been Georgia's KGB chief for two
months, was named to replace Patiashvili, said Zhorab Lomidze,
deputy director of the official Georgian news agency Gruzinform.
   The committee also removed two other members of Georgia's ruling
Politburo, Premier Zurab Chkheidze and President Otari Cherkeziya,
Gerasimov said.
   That means they lose their seats on the top party body, but they
remain premier and president, he said. ``They voiced a desire to
leave their (government) posts, but it is not a question that is to
be resolved by the plenary (party) meeting,'' Gerasimov said.
   However, Lomidze said Cherkeziya had not been removed from the
Politburo. Asked later by telephone about the conflicting report,
Gerasimov said he could not immediately clarify it.
   In shaking up the leadership of the southern republic in the
Caucasus Mountains, Georgian party officials were following a
pattern set last year in the neighboring republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan. After four months of nationalist protests, the Armenian
and Azerbaijani party chiefs were fired, apparently as a sign of
displeasure with their handling of the unrest.
   Regarding today's meeting in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital,
Gerasimov said that after a heated discussion the committee
unamimously ``met the request of comrade Patiashvili and relieved
him of the post of the first secretary of the Georgian Communist
Party.''
   Gerasimov did not give a reason for the shake-up or say exactly
what was discussed. But he said earlier that the leadership had
accepted responsibility for ordering soldiers to clear
pro-independence demonstrators in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, on
Sunday. At least 19 people were killed.
   Signs posted at Tbilisi State University after the clash called
Patiashvili a ``killer.'' Patiashvili, 49, was elected first
secretary in July 1985.
   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, a Georgian
who preceded Patiashvili as the republic's party chief, attended
today's meeting.
   The official news agency Tass said the Politburo decribed the
situation in the republic as ``strained,'' with universities and
schools still shut by boycotts. It said factories and public
transport were operating normally.
   Lomidze, however, said some businesses in Tbilisi were not
operating at normal levels because of a strike that began a week
ago in the city of 1.2 million people, 900 miles south of Moscow.
   Leda Archvadze, the sister-in-law of arrested Georgian human
rights activist Zviad Gamsakhurdia, said a memorial has appeared
outside Government House, the site of the bloody confrontation.
   ``There are mountains of flowers. Every day people place fresh
flowers,'' she said in a telephone interview today from Tbilisi.
   About 2,000 people marched through the streets Thursday for a
funeral for one of the victims, psychiatrist Zia Djinjaradze, 42,
according to human rights activist. No funerals were scheduled
today, but more were planned Saturday and Sunday, said Lomidze and
Ms. Archvadze.
   Nationalists have demanded the resignation of the local
government and a special session of the Georgian Parliament to
consider secession from the Soviet Union, according to official and
unofficial sources.
   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4, when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.
   Gerasimov told reporters on Thursday that a commission is
investigating whether soldiers who broke up Sunday's protest had
short metal shovels customarily used for digging trenches.
   If an investigation finds soldiers beat the protesters with
shovels, ``there is a question of whether these people should be
punished,'' he said.
   The Red Army newspaper today quoted medical examiners conducting
the investigation as saying they had found no evidence on victims'
bodies of gunshot or stab wounds.
   A curfew remains in effect in Tbilisi, Gerasimov said. Foreign
reporters have been barred from traveling to Georgia since unrest
there began.

   Fire swept through the 50-year-old

   No one was injured in the fire, which broke out about 2 a.m. in
the offices of the provincial education department.
   The cause of the fire is under investigation.
   Provincial Gov. Emilio Osmena estimated damage to the
three-story structure at $714,000. But other officials said another

   Osmena said it would take at least a year to restore the damaged

   Should NASA resume its program to
fly ordinary citizens on the space shuttle?
   Final Frontier, The Magazine of Space Exploration, wants
Americans to answer that question by calling 1-900-786-3663.
Dialers will hear a recorded message from former moon-walking
astronaut Buzz Aldrin, who will ask them to respond yes or no.
   The number will be open through June 30, and Final Frontier said
it will forward results to NASA; the National Space Council, headed
by Vice President Dan Quayle; congressional space committees, and
other space decision makers.
   Callers must use a touch-tone phone. They will be charged $1.25
for each call.
   NASA's plan to fly ordinary citizens on the space shuttle has

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. faces federal
supervision and a future without financier Michael Milken in its
out-of-court settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission
over Wall Street's biggest-ever securities fraud case.
   The agreement Thursday resolved civil charges that included
insider trading in more than 20 alleged fraud schemes and marked
another milestone in the government's crackdown on white-collar
corruption.
   It also cleared the way for Drexel to plead guilty to six felony
counts and pay a record $650 million in fines and restitution in a
separate settlement of criminal charges with the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office.
   Separately, Milken agreed today to set aside more than $600
million in assets that could be forfeited if he is found guilty of
charges in a sweeping fraud and racketeering charges that names
him, his brother Lowell and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg.
   The assets are being set aside under an agreement between
defense attorneys and federal prosecutors, who could have sought to
freeze all of the Milkens' assets pending the outcome of their
trials.
   Michael and Lowell Milken _ who himself agreed to set aside $50
million in assets _ also each agreed to post $1 million bail
secured by other assets in order to remain free pending trial.
Newberg is scheduled to be arraigned April 25.
   On Thursday, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder called the Drexel
settlement, reached after four months of often-bitter negotiations,
``the most far-reaching relief ever obtained by the commission
against a major regulated entity.''
   Drexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm, agreed to
submit to extensive monitoring by the SEC for three years; set up a
securities compliance watchdog committee and a disciplinary panel;
and appoint a new chairman, general counsel, ombudsman and
accounting chief subject to SEC approval.
   In addition, Drexel agreed to terminate all relations with
Milken, who helped transform Drexel into a Wall Street powerhouse
by peddling high-risk securities known as junk bonds, and to bar
its employees from direct or indirect business dealings with him.
   The settlement also ensures Drexel's cooperation in any future
government investigations.
   ``We think it achieves everything that's needed for the
protection of the investing public,'' SEC Enforcement Director Gary
Lynch said. ``It will also give us the ability to bring other
people to justice that might not be brought to justice if we had
stayed at war for another three to five years.''
   Milken could be rehired only if he is exonerated of all 98
racketeering and fraud charges filed by the government in a
separate indictment that seeks $1.8 billion in forfeitures from him
and two others.
   Drexel and Milken have been the main government targets since
the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal of 1986. Boesky, now in
federal prison, has been a leading source of evidence against
Drexel, Milken and others.
   Drexel said in a summary of the agreement that it was paying the
largest penalties ever in a securities case and making
``comprehensive and unprecedented structural changes'' that place
the private firm under tight scrutiny.
   ``We expect that as a result of this settlement agreement and
other steps we will take, Drexel will become the standard in the
securities industry,'' said Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H.
Joseph.
   Drexel, which said it lost an estimated $2 billion in business
during the government's investigation and spent hundreds of
millions of dollars defending itself, also immediately named as its
chairman John S.R. Shad, who started the Drexel probe during his
1981-87 term as SEC chairman.
   In addition, Drexel will pay $15 million in civil penalties, an
amount already accounted for under the total $650 million in
penalties it has agreed to pay the government.
   The 184-page SEC complaint filed last September described 21
alleged fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 and portrayed
Drexel, Milken and others as systematic cheaters who engaged in
stock manipulation, insider trading and other frauds.
   The pact still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Milton
Pollack, who temporarily has been barred from any rulings in the
case while the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to hear a
defense request to remove him because of an alleged conflict of
interest.

   Several members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee have privately raised doubts with the Bush
administration about the nomination of Donald Gregg to be
ambassador to South Korea because of his possible role in the
Iran-Contra affair, congressional sources Friday.
   However, Secretary of State James Baker III has reiterated his
support for Gregg's nomination to the high-profile diplomatic by
President Bush, Gregg's former boss.
   Gregg's nomination, which will be debated by the Senate
committee next month, is one of several that have run into
opposition in the light of disclosures about the Iran-Contra affair
that have surfaced in the trial of former White House aide Oliver
North.
   On Thursday, Michael Armacost, Bush's nominee for ambasasdor to
Japan, ran into questioning about documents indicating he attended
a 1985 meeting at which it was decided to release military aid to
Honduras in return for that nation's continued backing of the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   Armacost denied attending that meeting but promised to search
his records and report back to the panel. The congressional sources
said Friday that Armacost, who served in the No. 3 post at the
State Department in the Reagan administration, will tell the
committee he was invited to attend the White House meeting but did
not go.
   Also on Thursday, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called Baker to
ask that Gregg's nomination for South Korea be withdrawn, said
congressional sources commenting only on condition they not be
named. Margaret Tutwiler, Baker's spokeswoman, confirmed that
Cranston called the secretary but declined to say why.
   Baker then talked to Gregg ``and the status of the nomination
remains the same. The president supports his nominee,'' she said
Friday.
   When Bush was vice president, Gregg was his national security
adviser. His name is mentioned in several documents that became
public during the 1987 congressional investigation of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The final report from that investigation says that Gregg, a
former CIA official, knew that North was directing the Contra
supply effort _ at a time when official U.S. aid was banned _ but
that he contended he did not tell Bush.
   Another nomination facing some opposition is that of John
Negroponte as ambassador to Mexico. Negroponte was ambassador to
Honduras from 1981 to 1985 and some Democrats want to know whether
he was involved in the inducements promised the Honduran government
in exchange for its support of the Contras.

   Scores of flights were canceled in Rome and Naples
on Friday when Italian pilots went on strike for two hours and
flight attendants staged a daylong walkout.
   The strike by four flight attendants' unions, which began at
midnight Thursday, grounded nearly all planes of the state carrier
Alitalia and its domestic branch, ATI. Foreign airlines were not
affected.
   The flight attendants are protesting a deadlock in negotiations
to renew their contracts, which expired 17 months ago. They are
asking for a reduction in work hours, more time off and a salary
increase.
   Alitalia pilots have called daily two-hour strikes until April
21 to protest delays in their own contract talks.

   The prosecution rested today without
calling a key witness in the trial of a Christian Science couple
accused of murder and abuse in the death of their daughter from
untreated diabetes.
   William and Christine Hermanson are charged with third-degree
murder and felony child abuse in the Sept. 30, 1986, death of
7-year-old Amy after seeking the aid of spiritual healers but not
doctors.
   Defense attorneys were successful today in blocking the
testimony of a witness who had said with the jury out of the
courtroom that the Hermansons had gotten medical help when they
needed it but didn't seek insulin injections that could have saved
their daughter's life.
   Attorney Charles Arnold said the surprise testimony late
Thursday violated state rules of discovery requiring lawyers to
notify the other side of damaging testimony expected to be
introduced.
   After the prosecution acknowledged the defense hadn't been told
about the witness, Sarasota Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan reversed
himself and ruled today that the testimony was inadmissible.
   The witness, Mary Christman, said Thursday that she visited the
Hermansons three days after Amy's death and learned William
Hermanson previously had taken Novocain for a tooth problem.
   His wife suggested she had anesthesia during childbirth, Mrs.
Christman testified without the jury present.
   ``I said, `God, Chris, if Bill had Novocain and you had two
Caesarean sections, which I've had myself, how could you have done
that without any anesthetic?''' Mrs. Christman testified.
   Mrs. Hermanson replied, ``Well, that was a different
situation,'' she said.
   The couple is accused of third-degree murder and child abuse in
Amy's death in 1986. Prosecutors say the parents turned to
spiritual healing and prayer instead of medical attention that
could have saved Amy's life.
   The defense says the issue is religious freedom and cites a
state law exempting parents who have religious beliefs against
medical treatment from neglect charges. The Hermansons say they
were following Christian Science doctrine when they relied on
practitioners of spiritual healing for the child's recovery.
   ``I was frustrated and baffled when a simple shot of insulin
would have saved her life ... She looked like a refugee from a
death camp,'' Mrs. Christman said. ``(Mrs. Hermanson) said Amy felt
no pain, there was no illness. It was `negative transfers' that she
was picking up from other people.''
   Mrs. Hermanson contended Amy's body would have rejected insulin
because her husband's body rejected Novocain, Mrs. Christman
testified.
   Three times Thursday, Mrs. Hermanson broke down and cried
quietly at the defense table during the testimony of her daughter's
teacher, Laura Kingsley. The teacher said Amy was once bright and
creative but turned lethargic.
   Another witness, Helen Falb, an employee at the Hermansons'
academy, said that Amy looked ``skeletal'' a few weeks before her
death and said she had been vomiting and unable to sleep. Ms. Falb
said she did not tell the parents about the conversation.
   ``I knew about their religion and I know they wrote my paycheck
and I didn't want to create a stir,'' she testified.
   A 1975 Florida law states that parents who withhold medical
treatment for religious reasons cannot be considered ``abusive or
neglectful'' to their children.
   Five similar cases are pending nationwide.

   His sport coat was a blue-and-gold plaid,
but for once Gov. Bill Clements' jacket wasn't the loudest in the
Capitol.
   More than 40 House members donned their most outlandish plaids
Thursday to mark Clements' 72nd birthday, pass a resolution in his
honor and sing ``Happy Birthday'' to him.
   Rep. Tom Craddick, chairman of the House Republican Caucus,
organized Plaid Day, named for the governor's favored jacket
material.
   Some lawmakers had trouble finding just the right attire.
   ``(Rep.) Ashley Smith paid $2.50 for his at Goodwill,'' Craddick
said. ``Some borrowed them from some of the clubs around town that
lend you a coat when you go in without one.''
   The lawmakers' garish coats ranged from red plaids to greens to
a sky blue number with navy velvet collar and lapels that was worn
by Rep. Jerry Yost.
   All provided fodder for jokes.
   ``I had a 1948 Ford when I was in high school. These were the
seat covers,'' Rep. Richard Smith said of his red plaid jacket. He
later admitted to having worn it while being sworn in as a city
councilman in the 1970s.
   Rep. Ron Wilson said he doesn't own any plaid but did the next
best thing. He made his own, plastering a cream-colored sport coat
with brown packing-tape stripes. It featured a tic-tac-toe layout
on the back, complete with Xs and Os.
   ``Ten years from now, everybody's going to be wearing these
things. I'm telling you,'' Wilson said.
   Rep. Mark Stiles disagreed. ``Is that Ron Wilson or an unclaimed
UPS package?'' he asked.
   Clements, laughing, offered the lawmakers some fashion advice.
   ``I'm not sure exactly what response I should make about this
sport coat problem,'' he said. ``I can understand _ looking at some
of these sport coats _ why you all are wearing dark blue all the
time. I would have thought my taste in sport coats would give you a
better understanding about what's apropos and what isn't. Looking
at some of these, I just can't believe it.''

   A mystery man in a white limousine
surprised shoppers at a grocery store by handing out some green
goods of his own _ dollar bills.
   The stretch limousine bearing the license tag FOOD4U stopped at
a Megamarket store Thursday and a man who was described as a TV
preacher look-alike entered the store and talked to a manager
before doling out the cash.
   Walt Smith said he was flabbergasted when the man told him ``to
expect a miracle,'' patted him on the back and handed him a dollar.
   ``Pretty soon he's buying people's groceries,'' Smith said.
   ``He had a lot of gray hair in one of those Elvis hairdos, and
I've never seen so much diamonds and gold in my life,'' Smith said.
``It really was the funniest thing I ever saw.''
   Megamarket manager Mike Anderson, who wasn't working when the
giveaway occurred, said he was told the man wasn't in the store
very long.
   ``He just sort of popped in and popped out.''

   The State Department, responding to a call by
a group of senators, today registered its opposition to any effort
to grant the Palestine Liberation Organization membership status in
the United Nations.
   ``In our view, the self-declared Palestinian state, which we do
not recognize, does not meet the generally accepted international
law criteria for statehood,'' a department statement said. It added
that the PLO ``does not qualify for membership in U.N. agencies.''
   The 38 senators had urged Secretary of State James A. Baker III
on Thursday to oppose U.N. recognition of the PLO as a member
state, an upgrading of its current observer status.
   ``Any successful move by the U.N. or related agencies to
recognize the `state of Palestine' would force us to seriously
consider a range of punitive action, including withholding U.S.
financial participation from those agencies,'' the lawmakers said
in a letter.
   Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., and those who joined him said
the PLO was engaged in ``a public relations ploy to make
headlines'' rather than ``confidence-building measures to make
progress.''
   The senators said Yasser Arafat's group should not be treated as
a state because it does not control territory or any population and
is not a government.
   The State Department responded today that ``the United States is
ooposed to efforts to grant the PLO rights and privileges exceeding
its status as an observer organization within the U.N. system.''
   The statement, which was issued by the press office, said the
United States does not recognize the self-declared Palestinian
state.
   To gain recognition as a member state, the PLO would have to
apply to the Security Council, where the United States is one of
the five permanent members with veto power.
   If the United States did not block the PLO's application,
two-thirds of the 159 General Assembly members would then have to
vote for its admission as a member state.
   Baker, testifying Thursday before a Senate appropriations
subcommittee, told Kasten he had not seen the letter. He said the
United States would continue its talks with the PLO despite
statements by some PLO elements that appeared to challenge Israel's
right to exist.
   Baker also said the willingness of Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to consider holding elections on the West Bank and
in Gaza, followed by negotiations on a permanent settlement, was a
new and hopeful idea that should be fully explored.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., read several recent statements by
PLO officials that he said seemed to suggest they remain committed
to the creation of a Palestinian state and the destruction of
Israel.
   ``Statements such as those are clearly not helpful,'' Baker
said. ``We do look at statements such as that very carefully
because we want to continue the dialogue with the PLO under the
conditions under which they were started.''
   But he said that the PLO is composed of ``many dissident
elements, some of which are opposed to any dialogue with the United
States and some which have not renounced terrorism.''
   ``To date we are satisfied that the PLO is committed to what it
has told us, that it recognizes Israel's right to exist and that it
has renounced terrorism in all of its forms,'' Baker said.
   Baker said Shamir's proposal to hold elections among Palestinian
Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza was ``new, different and
significant.''
   He said the United States would encourage Shamir, Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein, who will be here
for talks next week, to preserve flexibility ``so that the options
may be explored and if possible capitalized upon.''
   Responding to questions, Baker said it would be difficult to
conduct elections if the violence associated with the Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories continues.
   ``Surely there has to be a greater degree of calm or tranquility
before you get to elections,'' he said.
   Baker's chief deputy, meantime, told a Jewish audience the PLO
may be sincere in its declaration that it no longer seeks to
destroy Israel.
   ``The evidence is mixed,'' Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger told leaders of the United Jewish Appeal.
   ``At the moment the jury is out,'' he said, when asked at a
luncheon whether he believed statements by Arafat in December that
the organization supported Israel's right to exist.
   ``There are questions that need to be answered, it is no longer
clear in either direction,'' said Eagleburger, traditionally a
strong supporter of Israel.

<HEAD>YSL Chairman Says Company Reorganizing, Dismisses Health Rumors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The house of Yves Saint Laurent is undergoing a
major managerial restructuring, but company officials say the
``king of couture'' will remain in control of creation, if not in
top form.
   Company chairman Pierre Berge said the reorganization will give
him absolute management authority, while Saint Laurent himself
stays on as the couturier.
   In an interview Friday, Berge brusquely dismissed rumors about
the health of the 52-year-old Saint Laurent.
   ``I give you my word of honor that he has neither cancer nor
AIDS, for which he is not even seropositive,'' Berge said. ``He is
working at home in Paris right now.''
   Berge said the company is being restructured to avoid any
possibility of an unfriendly takeover well into the next century.
   Overall, with couture, ready-to-wear, perfume and accessories
sales, the YSL empire is estimated to be worth nearly $2 billion.
   ``We have an eye on the future, hoping to go public on the
French stock market by 1990,'' Berge added.
   For several seasons, the reclusive Saint Laurent has been
refusing interviews and looking less-than-healthy as he walks, or
sometimes staggers, on runways after shows.
   Saint Laurent's swollen appearance, facial tics and difficulty
walking have given rise to speculation about his health.
   ``There's nothing new about Saint Laurent's illness,'' Berge
said. ``It's been talked about for 15 years. Everyone knows he has
had psychological problems, that he takes too many tranquilizers,
and that he sometimes looks somewhat confused.
   ``The company has a big insurance policy for him, and four times
a year he must have a complete physical checkup. Basically, he is
OK.''
   Berge, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal, said that
when the Saint Laurent company goes public on the French stock
market, it will in effect create a new company.
   Management will be headed by four men: Saint Laurent; Berge;
Alain Minc, head of Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti's French
holding company; and Jean-Francis Bretelle, managing director of
Yves Saint Laurent SA.
   ``I have a special role,'' said Berge, 58. ``In France we will
have a legal status that does not exist in America, I believe. It
will be a `Societe en commandite par actions.' That basically means
that no matter what stockholders vote, I alone will have the last
word.''
   When asked if that means he will he become the absolute dictator
of the YSL operation in France, Berge replied: ``That's right. At
last, at last.''
   At the moment, Saint Laurent and Berge are majority
shareholders, which they became when they bought back the Saint
Laurent perfume business two years ago from the Squibb Corp.,
backed by De Benedetti and his associates.
   Berge and Saint Laurent have been associated since they started
their fledgling fashion house in 1961.
   They first met and became friends after Saint Laurent's
sensational 1958 ``trapeze'' line collection for Christian Dior, as
Saint Laurent, age 21, took over designing for the Dior empire
following the couturier's death in 1957.
   Saint Laurent came to Paris in 1954 from his birthplace in Oran,
Algeria, and was soon introduced by Michel de Brunhoff, the editor
of Vogue, to Christian Dior. He was so impressed by Saint Laurent's
sketches he hired him on the spot as an assistant.
   Since the beginning, Saint Laurent has had a powerful impact on
fashion. He was the first couturier to make elegant trousers for
women, starting with the tuxedo suits of 1966, still a Saint
Laurent trademark.
   Since then he has put women into sophisticated versions of
Russian fete clothes, Chinese, Arab or Indian-inspired styles,
ruffled babydoll dresses, outfits based on works by modern painters
like Mondrian and Picasso, and more.
   From his youthful days, he became a classic designer with an
unerring contemporary fashion sense, a feeling for what chic women
want to wear.

   A federal grand jury today indicted the
head of Pennsylvania's student loan agency and his former top aide,
charging that they were involved in a scheme to extort money from a
contractor.
   The indictment names Kenneth Reeher, executive director of the
Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, who is the state's
highest-paid employee; and Harry Casoni, a former deputy who
retired in 1986.
   Also charged was Gabler Educational Management Services Inc., of
Libertyville, Ill., according to an announcement by U.S. Attorney
James West. He said the company is expected to plead guilty to a
bribery charge later today.
   The investigation, which has spanned more than a year,
continues, he said.
   Reeher, the only state employee to make more than $100,000 a
year, counting bonuses, has denied any wrongdoing.
   John Ebersole, a spokesman for the student loan agency, said
Reeher ``told us he would have no comment today. He expects to meet
with the officers of the board early next week, and he may have
something to say at that time.''
   The agency operates a financial-assistance program for college
students and holds contracts with lenders and agencies in other
states to service student loans.
   Last week, officials said an internal review of the case found
no evidence of wrongdoing by any current loan agency employee or
official.
   Casoni retired in 1986, the same year the agency entered into a
$1.7 million no-bid contract with the Illinois company.
   According to the indictment, Reeher, 66, and Casoni, 55, told
Gabler Educational Management Services it would receive a lucrative
no-bid contract if the two men were given money and property.
   The indictment charges Reeher and Casoni with one count each of
extortion and bribery, three counts each of interstate travel in
aid of racketeering and one count each of conspiracy.
   The charges carry a maximum 80 years in jail and $3.47 million
in fines.
   The bribery count against the company carries a maximum $500,000
fine. West said the company also faces other financial sanctions.

   A National Council of Churches delegation
met with Pope John Paul II on Friday, capping five days of talks
aimed at strengthening relations between the Roman Catholic Church
and other Christian denominations in the United States.
   The 11-member delegation, representing various Anglican,
Protestant and Orthodox churches, included four ordained women.
   The Roman Catholic Church bars women priests, and the pope on
several occasions has warned that ordination of women in the
Anglican Communion, which includes the U.S. Episcopal Church, poses
serious obstacles to Christian unity.
   Delegation leaders said ordination of women was not raised in
the meetings, noting there are divisions among the non-Catholic
U.S. churches themselves on the issue. They said, however, that the
women delegates were treated with respect by the pope and other
Vatican officials.
   ``We have been treated very well,'' said the president of the
council, the Rev. Patricia A. McClurg, an ordained Presbyterian
minister. ``We found that we all share the same faith.''
   Noting that the pope cited the angel's message to the women at
Christ's tomb, McClurg said, ``I found that as a sign of respect
for women.''
   The pope recalled his meeting with Christian leaders in
Columbia, S.C., during his 1987 visit to the United States and said
all Christians ``must walk the path of reconciliation.''
   ``I am confident that, as we seek to remain ever faithful to the
Lord, the cause of ecumenism in the United States will steadily
progress,'' he added.
   Delegation leaders said the visit, the first by the council to
the Vatican since 1969, was intended primarily to strengthen
relations between the group and the U.S. Catholic bishops'
conference and to learn how the Vatican Curia, the church's central
administration, works.
   The Rev. Arie Brouwer, a minister of the Reformed Church in
America and the general secretary of the council, described the
visit as a ``spiritual retreat together.''
   ``In the United States we are supposedly the melting pot, and
sometimes it's good to come and see how the other pots melt,' said
Bishop Philip R. Cousin of the African Methodist Episcopal Church.
``Positive steps toward unity can only begin when people begin to
understand each other.''
   Three Catholics were in the delegation, including Archbishop
James Francis Stafford of Denver, chairman of the U.S. bishops'
committee for ecumenical and interreligious affairs.
   ``It has been an enriching exchange for members of the Curia to
see the richness of Christian life in the United States,'' he said.
   The delegation met with officials of the Vatican Secretariat of
State, Secretariat for Christian Unity, Congregation of the
Doctrine of the Faith and the Justice and Peace Commission.
   Topics included relations with churches in the Soviet Union, the
role of the church toward apartheid in South Africa and the
church's adapation of various cultures.

<HEAD>East St. Louis Mayor Found In Contempt and Ordered To Jail</HEAD>

   A county judge today ordered East St.
Louis Mayor Carl Officer and the city attorney to jail after
finding them in contempt of court for failing to appear at an
earlier hearing.
   ``Your Honor, I was suffering from the effects of the flu,''
Officer said, attempting to explain to St. Clair County Judge
Sheila O'Brien why he did not appear before her March 31 to discuss
his city's leaking sewer system.
   The jailing order was the latest in a series of confrontations
and financial problems for the poverty-stricken city of 55,000
across the river from St. Louis.
   ``This is the most bizarre and outrageous situation I have ever
seen in a court of law,'' city attorney Eric Vickers said, shouting
as he challenged the judge's order. ``It is obvious this court has
no sense of fairness and decency.''
   ``Don't fight with me, Mr. Vickers,'' the judge responded.
``You're picking a fight you will not win.'' She set bond at $3,500
for each of the two men on the six-month jail sentence.
   Accusing East St. Louis officials of ``callous disregard'' for
the court's orders, Ms. O'Brien also reinstated an order of March 3
that the city post a $500,000 bond to guarantee that its sewers
will be fixed in 90 days.
   The order also requires the city to pay the costs of the lawyers
who took the sewage system complaints to court. Earlier, she had
dropped those requirements at Vickers' request.
   At the heart of the controversy is a two-acre pond at the Villa
Green housing project, which has filled with raw sewage, and was
ordered drained by the judge by early March.
   At the March 31 hearing, however, East St. Louis Public Works
Director Jesse Walker told Ms. O'Brien that his employees were
pumping sewage around the clock to keep it from backing into the
Villa Griffin pond, but a shortage of machines and manpower was
hindering progress.
   Sheila Shunick, a lawyer for tenants at the Villa Griffin
housing project, requested that the city show cause why it should
not be held in contempt. Ms. O'Brien granted her request.
   Ms. O'Brien has been holding hearings at two-week intervals on
the city's progress in stemming the flow of sewage from leaking or
blocked pipes.

   A bizarre series of shootings that
apparently began at the home of a local rancher and spread to a
nearby winery left at least one person dead and several wounded,
authorities said.
   Sonoma County Sheriff's Sergeant Gary Zanolini said one body was
found in a car near the Dunbar School in Kenwood. There were
unconfirmed reports of at least one other person killed.
   Authorities said they were looking for one or more people in a
1972 burgundy Ford.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department said Friday it has
approved the first field test of a genetically engineered cotton
plant that protects itself from destructive insects.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said permission was given to the
Agracetus Co., Middleton, Wis., for testing the new cotton variety
in Starkville, Miss., beginning immediately.
   Glosser said the testing procedure was reviewed by his agency
and determined to be ``well designed and environmentally safe.''
   The company's scientists inserted a gene into the cotton plant
from a common soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringienensis. The gene
produces a protein that is toxic to caterpillar-type insects but
not to humans, mammals or most other insects.
   Glosser said if the cotton performs as the company hopes, it
would mean the plants are protected against such pests as the
bollworm, tobacco budworm and armyworm. The department estimates
these pests cost U.S. cotton producers about $128 million in 1988,
including lost yields and costs of insecticides.

   President Corazon Aquino may visit
the United States to urge Congress to pass a bill granting her
country $200 million in aid, a U.S. businessman said Friday.
   It would be her second visit to the United States in little more
than two years.
   John Mulroney, president of Rohns and Haas Co., a
Philadelphia-based chemical manufacturing firm, said he met Mrs.
Aquino at the presidential palace and she told him of her tentative
plans. She did not say when she might make the visit, he said.
   Earlier this month, Mrs. Aquino told two visiting U.S. lawmakers
the aid money would be a signal to other countries.
   Officials said their country needed about $10 billion in
assistance to spur economic recovery.
   Japan, France, Australia and other countries indicated a
willingness to provide aid but only the United States has announced
a specific amount.
   Mrs. Aquino first visited the United States in November 1986.

   Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot
to $62 million today _ a national record _ as gamblers and dreamers
from as far away as Europe clamored to play.
   The geographical range is ``something we've never seen before,''
Illinois Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said Thursday.
   Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed
Lotto booths, where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just
about double the average, said Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans
of America, which runs the six Lotto kiosks.
   ``Who knows when the wheel of fortune spins or not?'' said
ticket-buyer Arthur Beane, a salesman from South Carolina.
   ``I want to win,'' said Florida developer Jack Ross.
   Ticket sales were also particularly brisk at lottery outlets
near Illinois' borders with Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri, as
residents from those states flocked to get in on the action.
   ``They're ordering them by the hundreds. One runner from Indiana
just bought $3,200 worth,'' sat Pat Poulos of the Deluxe Restaurant
in Danville.
   The Illinois jackpot had risen to $58 million by Friday morning.
And shortly after noon, lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem announced it
had swollen to $62 million _ topping the old record of $61.98
million set last October in California.
   Three winning tickets were bought in the California lottery, and
two of the three tickets had been purchased by groups of
co-workers, so the winnings were actually split more than 40 ways.
The largest lottery prize that went to a single ticket buyer was
claimed last September, when a Florida woman won $55 million.
   Ticket sales have increased the Illinois jackpot _ already
swollen by rollovers from three straight winless drawings _ by $5
million each day since Sunday.
   More than 23 million tickets had been sold by late Thursday.
   Ms. Rem said officials have received inquiries about the drawing
from California, Tennessee, Texas and other states.
   ``We've also gotten calls from Europe _ England, the Netherlands
_ with people asking how they can play,'' she said.
   Ticket sales have broken records every day this week. A total of
7.5 million tickets were sold Wednesday, a 20 percent increase over
the previous mark for a Wednesday set in 1986, Ms. Rem said.
   Each $1 ticket has two plays. In each bet, the bettor _ or the
computer _ picks six numbers between 1 and 54. The odds of winning
the Lotto on a two-play ticket are 12.9 million to one.

   U.N. agencies are preparing a $40 million
program to assist 70,000 Somalis displaced from their homes by war,
officials said Friday.
   U.N. agencies have been asked to submit a report on the program
to the office of Undersecretary-General Abdulrahim Farah by April
24, said agency officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Somalia has a population of 5.3 million and is one of the
poorest nations in the world.
   The government of President Mohammed Siad Barre has been
battling a rebellion by the Somali National Movement for seven
years in the north of the country.
   In addition, a war broke out between Ethiopia and Somalia in
1977 for control of the Ogaden region.
   About 70,000 Somalis are displaced in their own nation.
   Because they have not crossed any borders, they have not been
assisted by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   That Geneva-based U.N. agency has spent $60 million to $70
million in each of the last 10 years to assist Ethiopians in
Somalia and Somalis who sought refuge in Ethiopia.
   Somalia says there are 840,000 refugees in Ethiopia. Some
refugee officials believe the true number is closer to 400,000.
   Somalia also receives much U.S. aid, expected to reach $55
million in fiscal year 1989, because the United States has signed
agreements under which the U.S. military may use Somali bases in
the event of conflict in the Middle East.
   The United States already has a large naval base at the Somali
port of Berbera on the Gulf of Aden.

<HEAD>Cavazos Says Newspapers Must Help Improve Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Friday
urged newspaper editors to support public school improvement
efforts, saying such help is vital.
   ``I'm really here to enlist your help,'' Cavazos told the
American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``We must have your support
in these endeavors if they are to be successful.''
   Cavazos said high dropout rates, low test scores, drug abuse and
a high degree of adult illiteracy mean the nation is beyond the
``at risk'' description in a 1983 report and already in trouble.
   Newspapers should urge more parental involvement in school
management and educational decisions, more teacher responsibility
and more focus on early childhood education, he said. They should
also insist on curricular reform and should promote university
efforts to help primary and secondary schools, he added.
   Cavazos also urged the editors to support some of the education
priorities of the Bush administration, among them ``educational
deregulation'' that would allow the waiving of federal regulations
in some districts with innovative reform plans, and public school
choice programs that let parents decide which school their children
will attend.
   The secretary said open choice and competition have helped
higher education in the United States and could do the same at
lower levels.
   But he cautioned that any public school choice program must be
``very, very sensitive to equity in the system'' _ particularly
concerning minorities and the disadvantaged who may live near
sub-standard schools _ by improving ghetto schools and making
transportation available to students who opt to go elsewhere.
   Where schools are clearly unacceptable, Cavazos said during
questioning, ``the state ought to take them over, get them in
better shape or close them down. This country should not tolerate
third-rate schools.''
   In response to a question from ASNE President John Seigenthaler,
editor and publisher of the Nashville Tennessean, Cavazos stressed
that the school-choice plans favored by the administration involve
competition only among public schools.
   ``We are not prepared to move ahead ... in the federal
government'' into giving parents vouchers which they could use at
private schools, he said. ``At this time we have not moved into the
private school area.''

<TEXT>
   Tanks and armored vehicles rumbled through three
restive cities in the Baltics this week, frightening residents
already shaken by a fatal clash between the military and
demonstrators in Soviet Georgia, activists and journalists said
Friday.
   Military officials said it was only a training exercise, and the
heavy armor did nothing more threatening than drive around. But the
timing frightened and infuriated residents of Riga, Tallinn and
Tartu, journalists said.
   In addition, ``a monstrous number of troops'' appeared Monday
and Tuesday in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan in Soviet
Central Asia, following a nationalist meeting Sunday, according to
Moscow activist Viktor Rezunkov. There were no tanks and no curfew,
he added.
   Residents of downtown Riga, the capital of Latvia, woke up
Monday to the thunder of tank treads on the cobblestones, said Alex
Grigoriev, editor of the Popular Front newspaper Atmoda, or
Awakening. They looked out their windows to find 10-20 tanks and
other armored vehicles rolling down the street at full speed, with
guns aimed both forward and sideways _ at them, Grigoriev said.
   ``There was panic and indignation,'' he said. ``It was seen as a
provocation and an effort to exert pressure.''
   Ivar Kezbers, a secretary of the Latvian Communist Party,
appeared on television in Riga on Thursday to join the public
complaints and deny military claims that local officials had been
warned about the maneuvers, said Mikhail Bonden, correspondent for
unofficial journal Express-Khronika.
   Five tanks were seen Thursday on the streets of Tartu, Estonia's
university city, shortly before a large student demonstration
against military service, said Tartu resident Petr Vikhalem.
   Friday's Tartu newspapers said the tanks had lagged behind their
unit, which passed through the city during the night, Vikhalem
said. But people assumed the tanks' appearance was related to the
demonstration, he said.
   Armored personnel carriers were seen in the Estonian capital of
Tallinn on Friday, about three miles from downtown, said Tarmu
Tammerk of the newspaper Kodumaa, or Homeland.
   Estonian Radio journalist Sulev Hallik said he had seen no
unusual military activities even though his office is located near
Tallinn's tank regiment. ``It's warm here, but without tanks,'' he
said.
   No explanation was given immediately for the vehicles Tammerk
reported, but Hallik said military vehicles sometimes pass through
the city's outskirts.
   An editor at Estonian TV said Friday he had heard nothing of any
tanks. Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said he knew
nothing about it.
   All three cities have had demonstrations drawing tens of
thousands of people demanding greater autonomy. Estonia's
parliament last fall declared the republic sovereign and gave
itself the right to overturn Soviet laws.
   But activists in the Baltics have taken great pains to prevent
violence that could be used to justify the imposition of martial
law. There have been tense moments between Baltic natives and
Russians, but no violence for at least six months.
   The tanks in Riga were the most obvious, taking up stations at
major downtown intersections for two days, Grigoriev said. Lt. Gen.
Fyodor Kuzmin, commander of the Baltic military district, said on
Latvian TV the tanks ``were on maneuvers,'' Grigoriev reported.
   ``The general said they were training. But for what would they
be training in downtown Riga?'' asked Grigoriev. People feared the
troops might be preparing to put down demonstrations in Riga as
they did in Georgia, he said.
   On Sunday, troops charged Georgian pro-independence
demonstrators rallying in the capital of Tbilisi, and at least 19
people were killed.
   ``It's rather strange that right after Georgia there would be
tanks on the streets of Riga for the first time since the 1940s,''
said Bonden.
   The tanks' appearance coincided with a discussion by the Latvian
government of a proposed law requiring public sector workers to
speak Latvian. That bill is opposed by the ``Interfront'' movement,
a group of Russian nationalists who successfully backed Kuzmin's
election to the new Soviet parliament, Bonden said.
   Kuzmin said the tank exercises had been planned for some time
and local authorities had been forewarned, Grigoriev said. But
Kezbers, the party official, denied that on Latvian TV Thursday and
called the action ``a mistake by the soldiers,'' Grigoriev said.
   Kezbers called the presence of troops in Riga the day after the
tragedy in Georgia and parliamentary run-off elections
``unhealthy,'' Bonden said.
   The dozen armored personnel carriers appeared briefly in Tartu
shortly after noon Thursday, hours before a long-planned student
demonstration demanding the right to do their military service in
Estonia. Tammerk said such protests have been held almost daily in
Estonia recently, due to growing maltreatment of Estonian
conscripts in the army.
   ``They are being labeled fascists, even by officers,'' he said.
Letters in newspapers have offered ``horrific accounts'' of
torture, sexual abuse and beatings, he said.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel and Premier Indrek Toome wrote
Thursday to the Soviet Presidium and Defense Minister Dmitri T.
Yazov proposing that Estonians be permitted to perform their
military service in one of the Baltic republics, Tammerk said.

   Testimony in Oliver North's Iran-Contra trial
ended today and the judge said the jury will be isolated when it
starts considering North's fate toward the end of next week.
   ``It seems to us, both sides feel, it's appropriate to sequester
during the ... deliberations,'' said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell.
   Opening statements in the trial took place Feb. 21 and 48 people
have testified since then. Gesell said final arguments will begin
Tuesday, with the jury to be sequestered starting Wednesday night
at the earliest.
   One of the prosecution's final witnesses today was a former
National Security Council official who said North, then an NSC
aide, was so pinched for money that he complained about not having
enough to buy lunch and gasoline.
   But North's complaints suddenly stopped in mid-1985, said Mary
Dix, who was the NSC's director of administration. By that time,
North was controlling a secret cash fund run out of his office safe
intended to provide covert aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The fund was financed by Contra leader Adolfo Calero and former
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.
   The prosecution is seeking to portray North as a career military
officer who became money-hungry while working at the NSC.
   North is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 home security
system from Secord in 1986 and of converting to his own use $4,300
in travelers checks out of the secret stash he kept in the office
safe.
   Ms. Dix testified that North, then a Marine lieutenant colonel,
complained on five occasions through mid-1985 that he was strapped
for cash.
   On a few occasions in the hallway as she was going home, North
would run after her ``yelling Mary, Mary,'' she recalled. She said
that ``he would need cash to go home,'' complaining that he didn't
have enough to buy gasoline.
   In other instances, ``Colonel North would get very upset'' if
the petty cash box for paying cab fare was empty, Ms. Dix said.
   When North wasn't reimbursed rapidly enough for office expenses,
``He would be pretty frantic'' in trying to get NSC staffers to
process his expense accounts, ``to turn them around as soon as
possible.''
   ``He said his credit cards were charged to the max,'' she said.
   On a few other occasions while she was in her office, ``he would
run by. ... His face was red. ... He was very upset with my
staff,'' about not being reimbursed fast enough.
   ``I would herd him from my area,'' she recalled.
   North said at one point that there was ``not enough for cash to
go home'' and ``not enough for lunch money,'' she testified.
   Prosecutor David Zornow asked if North's complaining stopped.
   ``It stopped to the best of my recollection in mid-1985,'' Ms.
Dix replied.
   North testified Monday that the $3,000 balance on a used GMC
Suburban vehicle he bought in October 1985 was paid from money he
kept in a metal box in a closet at his home.
   But the salesman who sold the vehicle, William Howell, testified
today that North said he was going to get the money from the White
House credit union.
   ``It was my understanding that the money was to come from the
White House credit union ... the balance,'' Howell said.
   From February to May 1985, Secord, who had been enlisted by
North to run weapons to the Nicaraguan rebels, arranged four
private sales of arms for the Contras.
   Some $90,000 to $100,000 from Calero was funneled through
North's office safe, as well as $150,000 to $200,000 in cash from
Secord. North said he destroyed the ledger detailing how the money
was spent on orders from CIA Director William Casey.
   In testimony Monday, North said he paid off the $3,038 balance
on the $8,038 vehicle four days after making the down payment.
Prosecutor John Keker asked North whether he got $3,000 in cash
that day from Secord, whose office is a mile or two from the car
lot in Virginia.
   North said he got ``a lot of money from General Secord on a lot
of occasions'' and didn't remember that particular day.

   Exxon Corp. has sent the Alaska Public
Radio Network more than $32,000 for expenses the 24-station network
has incurred in news coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   ``The check's in the mail,'' Exxon spokesman Jan Cool said
Thursday. ``APRN will decide how the money will be distributed to
the stations that covered it.''
   Susan Braine, acting executive director, said network officials
decided it was ethical to accept Exxon money for coverage of a
story in which the oil company is involved.
   ``Exxon has underwritten our programs in the past,'' she said.
``A lot of the oil companies have supported us. It doesn't mean
that we won't report anything negative about them.''
   In many of Alaska's small towns and villages, the network's
member station is the only or primary source of news. The stations
are heavily subsidized by the state through the Alaska Public
Broadcasting Commission, and also rely on underwriting and
donations.
   But unlike underwriting, in which a company or other benefactor
provides money for the network to spend as it wishes, Exxon's
contribution is being made after the fact for coverage of a
specific news event involving the company.
   ``That's an interesting ethical question that I haven't ever
heard of before,'' said Frank Wetzel, ombudsman for The Seattle
Times.
   Wetzel said in a telephone interview that the ethical dilemma is
eased somewhat by the fact that network reporters already have
covered the spill without knowing that Exxon would be paying for
the coverage.
   ``But I wonder about the future,'' he said. ``Will there be some
very subjective withholding of criticism of Exxon now that the
reporters and producers know that their work is being financed by
Exxon? It's a pretty close question, I think.''
   Cool said that while ``the situation is unique,'' Exxon
considers the money just one contribution out of many it makes
routinely. She discounted suggestions that the network's
objectivity might be compromised.
   ``They certainly haven't been pro-Exxon in their coverage,''
Cool said. ``We did this really as a public service for the people
of Alaska who wanted to know the state of the oil spill.''
   Exxon made the contribution after officials learned the network
had asked Rep. Mike Davis to submit a supplemental state budget
request for the $32,283, Cool said.
   The network has maintained round-the-clock coverage of the
spill, sending six reporters and one technician to Prince William
Sound in the three weeks since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   Braine said the network would welcome additional money from
Exxon if it was offered.
   Wetzel, however, questioned the wisdom of accepting Exxon's
money when it's earmarked for spill coverage.
   ``If Exxon wanted to make a general contribution, that would be
one thing,'' he said. ``But it has the earmarks of financing
coverage of your own mess.''

   Doughnuts and coffee, pizza and headache
tablets will be available here and there when procrastinating
Americans, unable to put it off any longer, take those dreaded
federal tax forms to post offices for mailing by midnight Monday.
   Taxpayers seeking a sporting chance will find it in Virginia and
Texas, where special postal facilities to accept tax mail will be
added attractions at some baseball fields.
   For most Americans, tax returns must be postmarked by midnight
Monday. As usual, officials expect a crush at post offices.
   In a bid to make the best of the situation, a choice of
refreshments, provided by local broadcasters, will offered to
taxpayers in Salt Lake City.
   Doughnuts will be available at the main post office there thanks
to KDAB, while KLZX will offer pizza at the downtown station and
KKAT will provide refreshments at the West Valley station,
according to postal officials.
   Radio WIBA will include headache tablets in its offer of coffee
and doughnuts for late mailers at the Madison, Wis., Main Post
Office.
   Headache powders will be provided along with coffee by KSSN at
the Little Rock, Ark., general mail facility in North Little Rock.
   A special ``Tax Dodge'' station will operate on University
Boulevard in Little Rock, where KZOU-FM is sponsoring a party and a
special postal station will be set up. There will also be a
fund-raiser for the local United Fund, for taxpayers who have
anything left to give.
   Refreshments will be served and balloons handed out at the
Alexandria, Va., main post office, while nearby Ballston Mall in
Arlington serves up a party in the food concourse, where a special
postal station is set up for the event.
   A special late tax-acceptance facility is being set up at The
Diamond, the field where the Richmond, Va., Braves baseball team
plays. A postal official will throw out the first ball in the
Braves' game against Toledo and a postal chorale will sing the
national anthem.
   Meanwhile, a special postal facility will operate at Texas
Stadium between Dallas and Fort Worth, where Internal Revenue
Service and postal workers will be on hand until midnight.
   In Boise, Idaho, KIZN Radio will provide coffee and doughnuts at
the Main Post Office.
   In Memphis, Tenn., the Peabody Hotel is sponsoring an annual IRS
party, including paying postage for tax mailers who send in their
returns from the special mail booth in the lobby.
   Volunteer IRS officials will be available to answer questions at
postal facilities across the nation including, for example, Austin,
Texas; Minneapolis; Bluefield, W. Va.; Anchorage, Alaska;
Philadelphia; and St. Louis.
   In addition, many post offices will be offering curbside pickup
of returns.
   Postal clerks in Seattle will fan out to four shopping centers
across town to accept returns on Monday, with local radio and
television stations planning live broadcasts at some locations.
   Special collection cans, red ones, will be set out in the
Sacramento, Calif., postal area for April 17 postmarks.
   The mobile post office in Van Nuys, Calif., will be parked in
the parking lot at the main post office to handle last-minute
returns. A special window will be set up for people who need just
two stamps for their taxes, and workers will be stationed along the
curb to pick up returns from motorists.
   In Wichita, Kan., Postmaster Mary A. Brown expects her office to
handle 80,000 extra pieces of mail on Monday and is posting
collectors outside the main post office and a second facility to
collect returns until midnight.
   Even more traffic problems than normal are expected in San Diego
this year. Three collection lanes will be open at the main post
office on Midway Drive, but a sold-out Neil Diamond concert at the
San Diego Sports Arena will be bringing in added traffic and likely
will slow things down.
   Residents of one region get an extra day to file this year,
having until midnight Tuesday. That's because Massachusetts
celebrates a state holiday, Patriot's Day, on Monday.
   As a result, taxpayers whose returns and handled by the IRS
Center in Andover, Mass., have until Tuesday midnight to file,
according to IRS officials in Boston. That region includes all of
New England and part of upstate New York.
   Even though one day later than most of the rest of the country,
the Springfield, Mass., post office will hold its traditional
tax-night party, complete with coffee and a postal-workers band
singing such songs as ``Return to Sender.''
   An estimated 10,000 people attended last year, in attire ranging
from tuxedos to bathrobes.
   Students from Springfield Technical Community College and
representatives of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue will be
on hand to help last-minute filers, many of whom show up each year
with boxes of documents and do their tax calculations on the spot.

   Adm. William J. Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said Friday he will travel to the Soviet Union in
June, the first modern-day visit by such an officer.
   U.S. and Soviet officials are still working on the exact date
and other details, according to Crowe, who made the announcement
during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The visit is part of an exchange in which Marshal Sergei F.
Akhromeyev, the Soviet Union's first deputy minister of defense and
chief of general staff, traveled to the United States last July.
Akhromeyev visited North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma and South Dakota.
   ``This is a very positive development,'' said Sen. John Warner
of Virginia, ranking Republican on the committee. He noted that the
panel has advocated ``more exchange between our senior military
officers in terms of visits and meetings with the senior Soviet
military.''
   In the past, high U.S. and Soviet military officials have met in
connection with World War II conferences in Berlin and Yalta, said
Pentagon officials.
   During Friday's hearing on a wide range of issues, Crowe also
said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ``facing some gut-wrenching
decisions'' on the budget. Meanwhile, congressional leaders joined
President Bush at the White House to announce a $28 billion
deficit-reduction plan.
   The agreement calls for restraining overall fiscal 1990 growth
in military programs to below the rate of inflation. The Pentagon
would be held to about $299 billion in outlays, virtually the same
as this year. Military spending authority, which includes
commitments that span more than one fiscal year, would be about
$305.5 billion.
   ``This is going to be a tough, tough puzzle for the Defense
Department and it is going to require some reductions in some of
the pillars,'' Crowe told the committee. ``Whether they are force
reductions or not at this early stage remains to be seen.''
   Cheney hinted this week that the B-2 stealth bomber and other
high-tech weapons that haven't yet gone into production may be
prime targets as he tries to cut about $10 billion from the fiscal
1990 budget proposed by former President Reagan.
   Defense sources, who requested anonymity, also said Cheney is
considering a slowdown in production of Trident missile submarines
_ building one every two years instead of one a year _ and might
also order some cuts in troop strength.
   Cheney is facing an April 25 deadline for presenting the Bush
administration's military budget proposal to Congress.

<TEXT>
   In the three weeks since the Alaskan oil spill, irate consumers
have been cutting up their Exxon cards, comedians have been
savaging the petroleum giant, and environmental groups have used
the disaster to galvanize protest.
   Many gas station operators say, however, that they've witnessed
few effects of an organized boycott against Exxon Corp. They are
quick to add that the public should not hold them responsible.
   Radio announcers have been particularly vocal about the spill
and encouraging listeners to take action.
   Station KUBE-FM, for example, organized and promoted a two-hour
rally Wednesday at Seattle's Alki Beach to protest the spill.
Announcers Charlie Brown and Ty Flint spent 12 hours broadcasting
calls from the public about the oil spill. Four other radio
stations joined in a simulcast.
   An estimated 2,000 people attended the rally, forcing Seattle
police to close the only access to the beach.
   Meantime, Michael Siegal of KING in Seattle is trying to
generate national interest in a boycott. He has appeared on other
radio stations around the nation and said he is receiving 200
letters a day, many with cut-up Exxon credit cards.
   Elsewhere in Seattle, more than 500 people jammed a National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hearing Thursday that became
a forum to vent anger over the spill. The meeting was the last of
four called by the agency to identify issues pertinent to the
establishment of a national marine sanctuary along the Northwest
coast.
   ``I'm heartbroken over what happened in Alaska,'' said John
Church, who pasted up bright red ``Remember Valdez'' signs
throughout the building. Valdez is the Exxon tanker that ran
aground on a charted reef March 24 in Prince William Sound,
spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil.
   At radio station KARN in Little Rock, Ark., talk show host Pat
Lynch said Thursday that he has had guests on twice this week to
discuss the Alaska spill.
   ``Listeners are just plain upset and there is, I think, an
unusual sense of rage,'' he said. ``I think it hinges on two
things, one of which is the out and out undisguised greed of price
increases coming at this time, and also the certain knowledge that
the consumer will bear the cost of the Valdez cleanup.''
   In Los Angeles, morning show host Peter Tilden of rock station
KLSX-FM solicited volunteers to help in the cleanup. He also asked
listeners to slice Exxon credits cards and boycott the oil company.
   To others in radio and television, the issue has generated slick
jokes.
   On NBC-TV's ``The Tonight Show,'' host Johnny Carson said, ``I
don't think Exxon's new slogan helps at all: `Exxon, we're not as
bad as Union Carbide.'''
   But joking aside, Wayne Konitshek, managing director of the
Colorado Service Station Dealers Association, said three bomb
threats and two protests have been reported at Exxon service
stations since last weekend.
   He said the association is trying to make the public aware of
the difference between independently owned stations and company
owned stations.
   Independent dealers, he said, ``are as innocent as the otters in
Alaska.''
   Nonetheless, many station operators from Maine to California
said it was business as usual in the wake of the spill. Others
attributed any decline in sales to a recent increase in prices at
the pump.
   Richard Brown, manager of an Exxon station in suburban New
Orleans, said some customers have threatened to stop buying gas in
protest but said there has been no decrease in business.
   For its part, Exxon responded to two consumer groups' boycott
call earlier this week with a statement issued from its New York
headquarters, reiterating its regret about the spill.
   ``All of our customers are very valuable to us and we hope that
our effort in Alaska will convince them that we continue to be a
responsible company and one people like to do business with,''
Exxon said.

   A pair of disc jockeys who hold regular
``Call In and Win'' days for celebrities _ but never get a call _
were astonished when former Gov. Harold Stassen phoned in to claim
$99.50 on his 82nd birthday.
   WLOL-FM disc jockeys John Hines and Bob Berglund declared
Thursday ``Harold Stassen Call In and Win Day.'' At 8:45 a.m., they
got the call.
   ``Bergie,'' Hines told his partner over the air, ``say good
morning to Harold Stassen.''
   ``Well, you're kidding,'' a shocked Berglund said. ``Good
morning.''
   ``Good morning,'' Stassen replied.
   Stassen told Hines and Berglund he felt first rate.
   ``Somebody told him and he called in,'' said producer Mark
Bauer. ``I don't think he was listening.''
   Stassen, reached at his home in Sunfish Lake, confirmed on
Friday that he made the call. The perennial presidential candidate,
who claims to be last surviving U.S. signer of the United Nations
charter, says he'll use the money for his project to improve the
United Nations.

   Sheelah Ryan, biggest single winner of a
lottery jackpot in U.S. history, dipped into her $55 million prize
to help a group of university students trying to find homes for
more than 100 stray cats.
   Ms. Ryan, owner of two cats, sent a $1,000 check to the cat
project at the University of Central Florida. The group has taken
charge of animals that have been living off student handouts,
digging in trash cans for food and killing rodents, birds and other
small animals.
   ``She said she is really interested in the project because the
students have gotten involved in something positive,'' said Bill
Morris, the project's coordinator.
   In a note accompanying the check, Ms. Ryan wrote, ``Please tell
the young people involved in the project that I think they're
great.''
   Ms. Ryan, 63, of Winter Springs, has also set up a foundation to
help the needy. She could not be reached for comment Friday.
   Ms. Ryan won the jackpot in a Florida lottery Sept. 3, 1988. All
she wants in return for her donation, Morris said, is to be kept
informed how the cat project is going.

   Actress Kim Ulrich, who plays a young nurse
on the NBC television series ``Nightingales,'' says she and her
colleagues sympathize with critics who don't like to see them
running around in their underwear.
   ``I think that the fact that we've had to do all the underwear
scenes and all of the aerobic scenes, we've kind of banded together
to fight them,'' she said recently.
   Critics have complained the show focuses on sex rather than
nursing and casts the nursing profession in a bad light.
   The actress, who plays the character Allyson Yates in the
series, said she doesn't enjoy those sexy scenes.
   ``There are maybe a few people who do enjoy running around in
their underwear, and I'm not one of them,'' said the actress, who
is married to casting director Robert Ulrich.

   Conductor Zubin Mehta tore his sleeve once in
exuberance over Beethoven, then finished it off with Mahler.
Finally, he flung off his tail coat as the crowd wildly applauded.
   The occasion was the opening concert of a European Youth
Orchestra tour planned for Spain, Britain and India. The tour will
bring together two major Indian musicians for the first time at
home - Mehta and sitarist Ravi Shankar.
   Mehta, music director of the New York Philarmonic and life music
director of the Israel Philarmonic, tore his sleeve Thursday night
during the initial Beethoven overture of Leonore III.
   A seamstress sewed a patch on the tear at intermission, but
Gustav Mahler's symphony No.1 split it again, making it even larger
for two encores. To thundering applause, Mehta finally pulled off
his jacket and threw it on the stage.
   The tour was organized to commemorate the 100th anniversary of
the birth of the late Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru.

   The government reported Friday that business
inventories rose 0.5 percent in February while sales fell 0.9
percent, a combination that analysts said could point toward
production cutbacks if it continues.
   Inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally
adjusted $763.6 billion in February following a 0.8 percent
increase in January, the Commerce Department reported.
   Sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted $507.3
billion in February after rising 1.1 percent in the previous month.
The decline was the first since sales fell 0.2 percent in November
1987, the month after the stock market crash, and marked the
steepest drop in more than two years.
   February's report was consistent with a host of other
indications that economic growth is slowing as the record peacetime
expansion extends into its seventh year.
   If increases in inventories are not accompanied by rising sales,
analysts say the result could be production cutbacks that hold down
economic growth.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said the inventory buildup isn't alarming yet, ``but
unless we can get some sales they are quickly going to be at a
disturbing level.''
   ``The accumulation rate really has been heavy enough that we
could develop excesses rather quickly if sales did soften,''
Dederick said. ``I view this as a danger area.''
   February's business activity produced an increase in the ratio
of inventories to sales to 1.51 to 1, meaning it would take 1.51
months to exhaust inventories at February's sales pace. The ratio
had been 1.48 to 1 in January.
   February's increase in inventories was led by a 0.8 percent rise
in stocks held by retailers, followed by a 0.5 percent gain in
manufacturer inventories and a 0.2 percent gain at the wholesale
level.
   In the retail category, stockpiles of unsold cars were up 0.4
percent as sales declined 2.4 percent. Auto sales have been weak
this year, and carmakers are offering new incentive programs in
hopes of luring more people to dealerships.
   February's decline in business sales included a 1.7 percent drop
in manufacturer sales, a 0.6 percent drop in retail sales and a
virtually unchanged level of sales activity for wholesalers.
   Analysts have blamed February's poor sales figures on harsh
weather that followed a warm-weather surge in January. March's
advance report on retail sales showed purchases edged up 0.1
percent.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Widens Sharply as Improvement Fizzles</HEAD>

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened
sharply in February, the government said Friday, bolstering
economists' belief that improvement in the nation's trade
performance is fizzling.
   The Commerce Department said the monthly, seasonally adjusted
deficit swelled 20.9 percent to $10.5 billion, up from a revised
$8.68 billion in January. The deterioration reflected a 5.3 percent
increase in imports, which swamped a slight 0.6 percent improvement
in sales of U.S. goods abroad.
   The trade gap for the first two months of the year is running at
an annual rate of $115 billion, scarcely below the $119.76 billion
deficit for all 1988.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said, ``I continue to be
encouraged that the annual deficit will show further improvement in
1989,'' but most private economists disagree.
   The rise in oil prices to the $20-a-barrel level will inflate
imports, while the strength of the dollar will make the price of
American goods more expensive, discouraging export sales, they say.
   ``Trade fizzled some time ago and this fits in with the theme
that we're still on an unacceptably high plateau,'' said Robert
Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   ``The good news is that after worsening in the fourth quarter,
the trade deficit seems to have narrowed a bit, but the bad news is
that still leaves us no better off than last spring,'' he said.
   A dramatic 21 percent decline in the trade gap last year, from a
peak of $152.1 billion in 1987, accounted for nearly half of
overall economic growth as measured by the gross national product.
The Bush administration is counting on further trade improvement to
bolster the economy and help it meet its pledges to reduce the
federal budget deficit without new taxes.
   The February performance reflected a 5.3 percent jump in
imports, which rose to a seasonally adjusted $39.4 billion. The
higher figure included increases of $1.0 billion in sales of
foreign capital goods to businesses and $800 million in purchases
of foreign cars.
   ``It's clear that major improvement in trade continues to be
held captive by our addiction to imports,'' said economist Jerry
Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``The U.S.
continues to suck in ... industrial materials, parts and
equipment.''
   U.S. oil imports managed to decline 7.2 percent in February to
$3.24 billion despite the third consecutive increase in the price
of a barrel of oil, $15.08, up from $14.46 a month earlier.
   ``We know that has to go up because oil prices are now about $20
a barrel. That's going to add $1 billion a month to the deficit,''
said economist Michael K. Evans, who owns a Washington consulting
firm. ``We're going to have a lot more increases in the trade
deficit. It's going to go to $12 billion a month pretty soon and
it's going to stay there.''
   U.S. exports were up a lackluster 0.6 percent as drops in
agricultural and manufactured products nearly offset gains in sales
of industrial products and autos.
   As usual, the United States posted its largest trade deficit
with Japan in February, $4.65 billion, up 31.7 percent from a
three-year low of $3.53 billion a month earlier.
   The deficit with Western Europe was $624 million, a
deterioration from January's rare $46 million surplus.
   Willard A. Workman, director of international policy for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the February report indicates that
the drop in the deficit with Japan in January was ``only a blip on
the trade radar scope.''
   The stall in trade fits in with other evidence of slower growth
in reports released Friday, including two consecutive flat months
of industrial production in February and March, a moderation in
wholesale price inflation and the sharpest drop in business sales
in February in more than two years.

is an understanding between the U.S. and Israel about our
four-point peace initiative.''
   Shamir met last week with President Bush, who supported Shamir's
idea for elections in the occupied territories but said the United
States could not accept permanent Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Earlier Friday, Israeli sources confirmed a Jerusalem Post
report that a cable with Shamir's proposal was sent to Israeli
embassies abroad.
   Shamir's plan offers elections to choose representatives from
the occupied territories to negotiate an interim settlement with
Israel.
   In later negotiations on a final status for the territorities,
``Israel will be prepared to discuss any option which will be
presented,'' a source quoted the cable as saying. The source spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The government statement appeared to leave open the possibility
that Israel would be willing to consider PLO demands for a
Palestinian state despite Israel's stated opposition to such
proposals.
   Several West Bank Palestinians have offered a counterproposal
that says residents should elect members of the PLO's Palestine
National Council instead of representatives for talks with Israel,
Israel radio and Palestinian sources said.
   At a later stage, three of those elected would be nominated to
negotiate a two-year interim agreement with Israel, according to
the reports.
   ``Palestinians see Shamir's plan as an attempt to bypass the
PLO,'' said Palestinian journalist Daoud Kuttab. ``But we are ready
to consider elections to the (council.) This would neutralize the
problem we have with Shamir's idea.''
   The Palestinian plan also calls for partial Israeli army
withdrawal before elections are held under international
supervision.
   In the last stage, the PLO and Israel would negotiate the final
status of the occupied lands in the framework of an international
peace conference.
   Shamir has rejected international supervision of elections,
talks with the PLO and an international conference.
   Shamir's peace plan essentially repeats the 1978 U.S.-sponsored
Camp David Accords, which led to peace with Egypt but have been
rejected by the Palestinians because they promise only limited
self-rule. But it adds the elections for Palestinian negotiating
representatives.
   Like the Camp David Accords, the new plan would leave
negotiations on the final status of the territories until the third
year of a five-year period of autonomy.
   The territories are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.

   A series of shootings at a ranch, a
winery and two homes today left at least five people dead, and
authorities say they are looking for a missing winery worker and
his three young daughters.
   A statewide alert was issued for Ramon Salcedo, about 50, after
three persons were found dead at the home of his mother-in-law and
another woman was found dead at his home. The fifth victim was shot
to death at the Grand Cru Winery, where Salcedo worked.
   Authorities did not identify the victims.
   Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelson said it appeared that
Salcedo, went to the ranch of a prominent local man, Bob Kunde, and
wounded ranch worker Kenneth Butti in the shoulder.
   Then, said Michaelson, the gunman went to the Grand Cru Winery
and shot a male co-worker to death before fleeing in an aging
maroon Ford sedan. The body was found in a car near the winery.
   A woman answering the phone at the winery said officials there
would have no comment.
   Michaelson said the gunman then went to his home in nearby Boyes
Hot Springs. The body of a woman was found there, and Salcedo's
three girls, ages 2, 3 and 4, were reported missing.
   Later, Lt. Gary Zanolini said, the bodies of two adults and a
child were found at the home of Salcedo's mother-in-law in Cotati,
about 5 miles west of here.
   ``I've never spoken to him,'' said Carol Settles, who lives near
the Salcedo home.
   ``They are pretty quiet ... except for him yelling,'' said
Settles. ``I never heard what he was saying. I heard them arguing,
but not the words.''
   Butti was listed in fair condition at Santa Rosa Memorial
Hospital.
   Glen Ellen is a town of 1,500 in the wine-making region of
Sonoma County, north of San Francisco.

<TEXT>
   A convoy bringing food and fuel to
Kabul broke through a guerrilla blockade Friday, with Afghan
soldiers and helicopter gunships providing cover as the trucks
rolled down the Salang Highway.
   The government said another major highway was reopened Friday,
allowing trucks to carry supplies to Jalalabad, which has been
under rebel fire for more than five weeks.
   Fighting continued on the Salang Highway for nearly two hours,
and thick, black smoke billowed from the mountains a few miles
away. The highway, a vital supply route leading into the deprived
capital, was closed a week ago by Moslem guerrillas who are hoping
to starve the city into surrender.
   The convoy comprised up to 100 vehicles. As it moved slowly down
the highway, soldiers fired from tanks and machine gun posts into
the surrounding mountains, where the guerrillas are hiding.
   Several trucks appeared to have been damaged and one was
carrying several wounded men. Diplomats who spoke on condition of
anonymity said about 600 trucks were still stranded along the
Salang.
   Another convoy moved out of the capital and down the highway
linking Kabul and Jalalabad, a provincial capital about 70 miles
away.
   The government said the convoy took supplies to government
soldiers who had been depending on air drops. The road, which also
is used to ferry supplies to Kabul, was closed to routine traffic
almost two weeks ago.
   The guerrillas say they control about 20 miles of the highway,
the major route to the border with Pakistan.
   The guerrillas have made blockades a primary tactic in their
fight to overthrow the Marxist government, which seized power in an
April 1978 coup.
   The Soviet Union has been flying food and military equipment to
Kabul. Supplies also are being flown to Jalalabad and Khost, said
one senior Soviet source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source indicated Moscow would send the Afghan government any
arms it needed to hold Jalalabad.
   ``They can have the hardware at our disposal in any numbers they
want,'' the official said. ``Jalalabad must be held. It will be
held.''
   The source said about 2,000 government troops had died since the
guerrillas began bombarding the city. He said 8,000 rebels had been
killed in retaliatory strikes.
   If Jalalabad falls, it would be the largest city captured by the
rebels and would give them a base to set up an interim government.
   The Afghan armed forces are equipped with sophisticated weapons
from the Soviet Union, including long-range Scud-B missiles.
   Soviet officials have denied Moscow has sent any new arms to
Afghanistan since the Red Army pullout was completed Feb. 15. A
U.N. accord that mandated the withdrawal prohibits outside
interference, but the various signatories have accused each other
of violating that provision.
   At the United Nations, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said
U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer has offered to act as a go-between
to foster peace in Afghanistan.
   Wakil, who addressed the Security Council this week, said
Hammer, chairman of Occidential Petroleum, invited him to Los
Angeles in the next few days to discuss peace prospects. But he
said the State Department prohibited the meeting.
   ``We received his invitation and communicated it to the State
Department to get a travel permit. However, this was denied,''
Wakil said. ``It was quite strange to see in this advanced and very
civilized nation, where Americans speak of democracy and free
movement, that such rights are denied.''
   The U.S. government routinely restricts the travel of officials
of communist countries and those with which the United States has
no diplomatic relations.
   Hammer, known for his efforts to establish ties between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has visited Afghanistan several
times in the past two years.

<HEAD>Pentagon Official Sees Shift of Research and Development Overseas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon research official said Friday that
the U.S. defense industrial base is being hurt by American
companies' increasing shift of research and development activities
overseas.
   ``I'm very concerned about the movement of research and
development offshore,'' said Craig I. Fields, deputy director for
research of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   Fields said that while companies may have made the ``right
business decision'' in the short run, such a trend is likely to
have an adverse impact on this country's long-term military and
economic capabilities.
   He also expressed concern about the ``increasing dependency of
the Defense Department on foreign components and technologies.''
   DARPA has sought to bolster U.S. capabilities by channeling
research funds into key technologies _ including advanced
semiconductors, supercomputers and so-called artificial
intelligence _ with both military and civilian applications.
   Fields, speaking at a conference sponsored by the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, said much more needs to
be done to coordinate U.S. longer-term defense research aims with
programs of civilian agencies such as the Commerce Department.
   ``It has to be a government-wide posture, not a defense posture
alone,'' he said.
   Jacques Gansler, a former Pentagon official, called for the
formulation of an overall ``defense industrial technology
strategy'' to guide military research and development efforts.
   Currently U.S. weapons ``are being designed so that they are
incredibly expensive and so complex that they won't work,'' said
Gansler, senior vice president of Analytic Sciences Corp., a
research company in suburban Arlington, Va.
   He said that with greater emphasis on manufacturing process
technology, the nation's defense industries should be able to
achieve higher quality production at lower cost.
   Also speaking at the conference was John Pike, associate
director for space policy of the Federation of American Scientists,
a Washington-based public interest group.
   Pike, a long-time critic of the Star Wars missile defense
effort, said that the program _ formally called the Strategic
Defense Initiative _ now appears to be firmly entrenched and on the
verge of demonstrating ``real technological results.''
   With the scaling-down of Star Wars goals from a complete nuclear
shield to defense of selected U.S. military targets, Pike said,
``at least we're dealing with a system whose cost and performance
goals are not obviously absurd.''
   Reagan announced the research effort in a televised speech in
March 1983. For the current fiscal year, $4.1 billion is provided
for SDI. Reagan's last budget requested an increase to $5.9 billion
for the 1990 fiscal year.
   ``Beginning this year we are going to start seeing real tests of
real hardware,'' including high-powered lasers, Pike said.

<TEXT>
   About 60 miles south of Valdez, Ed
Morris walks a sad beat on beautiful but hauntingly empty Green
Island.
   Morris is a regular visitor to this and other oil-stained
islands in Prince William Sound. His job is to collect dead animals
and birds and occasionally a half-dead sea gull or otter, so mired
in oily goo that it can't float or fly.
   Since he began the job eight days ago, he's recovered 100 dead
creatures; 12, maybe 15, live ones. That is a small fraction of the
thousands that have died or been contaminated since the Exxon
Valdez went aground three weeks ago, spewing 10.1 million gallons
of oil into sound's bountiful marine habitat.
   Morris rides to the unpopulated islands in an orange Zodiak
rubber boat, watching both the edge and top of the shoreline.
   ``The dead ones are usually up here in the oily grass,'' he
says, pointing to the high-tide mark of greasy seaweed. ``They just
roll up there with the tide.''
   The living ones are down by the water's edge. ``They stay there
in case they feel threatened so they can try to get away in the
water.'' he says.
   If they swim away, it will mean death. Their fur and feathers
are coated with oil. They can no longer float or keep their body
warmth.
   Animals still living are flown to Valdez where they are cleaned
and ``rehabilitated.'' The dead ones are collected by a shuttle
boat.
   ``It's all pretty sickening,'' says Morris, a Cordova resident
who normally fishes for salmon in the adjacent oil-fouled waters of
Knight Island.
   Morris was wintering in California when he heard about the
spill. He hurried home. ``I wanted to take care of whatever had to
be taken care of,'' he says.
   So Morris was hired by VECO, a subcontractor of Exxon helping to
conduct the cleanup. He is one of the hundreds signed on during the
employment boom created by the spill.
   The money, at a base wage of $16.69 an hour, is good and it is
steady. Jobs are likely to last a long time in the aftermath of the
spill. Morris is doing his part, but he doesn't like what he sees
on the quiet shorelines.
   ``I don't enjoy it, but somebody's got to do it, I guess,'' he
says.

   Army gunfire Friday wounded more than 20
Palestinians in the occupied lands, including a 3-year-old girl,
during protests of the bloody raid by border police in the village
of Nahalin, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army said a 14-year-Palestinian died of a bullet wound in
the head sustained last week during clashes with troops in the West
Bank town of Jenin, an army spokeswoman said.
   In Jerusalem, police barred residents of the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip from entering the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third
holiest site.
   The army launched an investigation Friday into the raid before
dawn Thursday at Nahalin in which at least five Palestinians were
killed, the national Itim news agency reported. It said two
brigidier generals were leading the inquiry.
   In Geneva, the Red Cross said six Arabs were killed in the West
Bank village near Bethlehem and accused Israeli paramilitary border
police of firing ``without discrimination and without restraint.''
   The clash was one of the bloodiest in the 16-month Palestinian
uprising, during which 430 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been
killed.
   Maj. Gen. Meshulam Amit, commander of the border police, told
The Associated Press the dimensions of the killings ``underscore
the need to thoroughly examine the incident.''
   ``If there were irregularities or mistakes made by the border
policemen, the appropriate action will be taken,'' he said.
   The border police have recently been given the prime role in
search-and-arrest raids and riot control, with the army working as
backup. The army commands border police in the occupied territories.
   At least 11 refugee camps, towns or villages in the West Bank
and occupied Gaza Strip had demonstrations or were shut down by
general strikes called to protest the slayings.
   The worst confrontation was in the Askar refugee camp near
Nablus. Arab doctors said 14 Palestinians there were hospitalized
with gunshot wounds.
   Doctors, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the wounded
included 3-year-old Nesien Fayad, who was shot in the left side.
   The army confirmed a report of two people wounded in Gaza and
said it was checking further reports.
   Police in Jerusalem took unprecedented measures to prevent
violence at the Al Aqsa Mosque during Friday's Moslem prayers. A
riot occurred there during last week's prayers, and at least 2,000
extra police were called in Friday to prevent similar violence.
   The mosque is on the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as Haram
Sharif, or Noble Enclosure. The elevated platform also houses the
Dome of the Rock mosque and is lined on one side by the Western
Wall, the last remnant of the second Jewish Temple. The site is
sacred to both Jews and Moslems.
   Police reported only about 7,000 Moslems attended prayers at Al
Aqsa, far fewer than the 30,000 predicted. Apparently many were
kept away by curfews on refugee camps and roadblocks outside
Jerusalem.
   In an unprecedented move, Israel closed a key gate leading to
the site, taking control of the gate away from the Moslem
authorities.
   After Al Aqsa's Friday prayer services, 40 Palestinians gathered
outside the mosque and began chanting ``With our blood and souls we
will redeem you, oh martyrs!''
   They dispersed peacefully.
   In the West Bank town of Hebron, five Palestinians were shot and
wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops, including three
wounded in a confrontation after Moslem prayer services, Arab
reporters said.
   They said the worshipers shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' or ``God is
Great!'' and threw rocks at border policemen as they left Hebron's
Al Sunieh Mosque.
   In the Gaza Strip, three Palestinians were wounded in the
village of Bani Suhaila in clashes that followed Friday prayers,
hospital officials said.

<TEXT>
   A century after one-tenth of the United
States Army converged on a parcel of land in Indian Territory to
oversee the region's first great land run, the blue coats are
returning to Fort Reno.
   About 500 re-enactors _ including 150 military hobbyists from
five states _ will take part in a weekend encampment organizers
hope will authentically reproduce the excitement of the days before
the Run of '89, in which settlers stampeded the area to claim land
that was free for the taking.
   The goal is to ``give a good history lesson,'' said Deborah
Foreman, who with her husband Gary helped organize ``Fort Reno and
Indian Territory Days.''
   Participants representing cavalry and infantry units of the
period are coming from Illinois, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas as
well as Oklahoma, Mrs. Foreman said.
   Spectators at the Fort Reno parade grounds Saturday and Sunday
will see cavalry competition, infantry drills, Indian dancing, a
wagon demonstration, a frontier fashion show, period music and
simulated gunfights, she said.
   About 120 Indians will show how their ancestors lived before the
land run and will participate in ceremonies during the
re-enactment, Mrs. Foreman said.
   She said organizers were careful to consider the feelings of
tribal officials, who see no reason to celebrate the centennial of
another episode in which the government took away Indian land.
   ``This event is a living history demonstration. This is not a
land run celebration,'' Mrs. Foreman said.
   The events at the historic fort west of El Reno constitute the
largest authentic re-enactment in the state. It is a prelude to
events in Guthrie, where the centennial of the land rush will be
observed the following weekend.
   A century ago, thousands of settlers gathered in camps around
the Unassigned Lands in the days before the run, collecting
supplies and girding for a mad dash for land.
   About 2,500 soldiers were stationed in and around the 2 million
acres of the Unassigned Lands in what is now central Oklahoma.
Their job was to help federal marshals keep the peace and to keep
out the ``Sooners'' who tried to sneak in early.
   ``Most of the trouble encountered was evicting squatters,
rounding up cattle rustlers, timber thieves, hunters and notifying
ranch owners to vacate their cattle prior to April 20,'' Sgt. John
Brandt, trumpeter of Troop L, 5th Cavalry, wrote.
   At noon on April 22, 1889, the boom of cannon from Fort Reno and
gunshots and bugles elsewhere signaled the beginning of the run for
more than 40,000 settlers.
   ``There were sounds of a mighty roar and cheer, whips cracking
and men shouting to their horses,'' said Brandt, who was stationed
near Purcell, one of eight major starting points for the run.
   ``The saddle horses plunged and raced by at top speed, the
lighter vehicles and faster horses stretched out towards the river.
Then the slower horses and heavier wagons thundered by.''
   While there were more than a dozen other land openings through
lotteries and runs before statehood in 1907, historians say it was
the first land run that started the inevitable movement toward
statehood.

   Clayton Moore, known to generations of
television viewers as the Lone Ranger, has been hospitalized for an
irregular heartbeat, a family spokesman said Friday.
   ``He's in stable condition, he's undergoing tests and he's
resting comfortably,'' said John Flaherty, a friend of Moore and
his wife, Connie.
   Moore, 74, who lives in the Calabasas area northwest of Los
Angeles, was admitted to an undisclosed hospital Thursday, Flaherty
said. Moore's wife asked that no other details be released.
   The Lone Ranger, with his hallmark shout of ``Hi-yo Silver!''
rode into the nation's living rooms first by radio in 1933, and
later on television, beginning in 1949.
   Although veteran actor John Hart also put on the ranger's mask
for a couple of seasons, Moore was the best-known TV Lone Ranger, a
role he also played in two feature films made in the late 1950s.

   Police dispersed about 1,000 Moslem
worshipers protesting the arrest of a fundamentalist cleric outside
a mosque Friday, security sources said.
   Worshipers began anti-government chants after a prayer service
at the mosque, but the crowd quickly dispersed when 15 trucks
filled with riot police arrived, the sources said on condition of
anonymity.
   Some demonstrators threw stones at police, the sources said.
   Before the protest, police rounded up 200 Moslem extremists to
prevent them from participating, sources said.
   Worshipers were reacting to last week's arrest of Sheik Omar
Abdel-Rahman, a blind cleric who was charged with inciting people
at an April 7 demonstration to agitate against the government. Four
people were wounded and 39 detained in the protest following a
prayer service in Fayoum, 65 miles southwest of Cairo.
   Abdel-Rahman had been acquitted in the 1981 slaying of former
President Anwar Sadat. He was accused of directing followers from a
clandestine extremist group, Jihad, to kill the former president.
Although he and another fundamentalist were acquitted, 17 people
were put to death and five received long prison terms.

<HEAD>State Department Praises Contra Aid Pact, Warns Sandinistas of Deadline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Friday praised
congressional approval of new aid for the Contra rebels and warned
the Nicaraguan government that the deadline for fulfilling its
commitment to political reforms was only 11 days away.
   The State Department's statement appears designed to use the
leverage it was granted by Congress to prod the Soviet-backed
Nicaraguan government into giving the Contras a share in the
political process.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meantime, told the American Society
of Newspaper Editors convention he hopes the American press will
watch Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega closely to see if he keeps
his commitments to democratic reforms.
   ``Are the Sandinistas finally willing to take the course that
all the Central American governments committed themselves to ...?
Are they prepared to negotiate with the internal opposition and the
Nicaraguan resistance in order to promote national reconciliation
among all Nicaraguans?'' he asked. ``We will know the answers to
these questions, and we will know them relatively soon.''
   Congress on Thursday approved a $49.7 million package of food
and medical aid for the Contras to last them for 10 months until
they can return to their homes in Nicaragua and be assured
participation in a democratic political system.
   The compromise package was worked out by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to avoid the kind of divisiveness with the
Democratic-controlled Congress which derailed past administration
attempts to aid the Contras.
   ``We welcome passage of the legislation,'' said spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler. ``Approval of this assistance is a tangible
manifestation of bipartisanship.''
   At the same time, the Sandinista government must now comply with
an agreement by the Central American countries which calls for
Nicaragua ``to create the conditions which will allow for the
reintegration of the resistance into a safe, democratic
Nicaragua,'' she said.
   ``We are deeply concerned by the refusal thus far by the
Sandinistas to negotiate with the internal opposition on the reform
of electoral laws,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   On Thursday, the ruling Sandinista party condemned the Contra
aid package, saying it threatens the Nicaraguan government and
``makes fun of the will of the Central American presidents.''
   The presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa
Rica signed a pact on Feb. 14 in El Salvador, agreeing to draft a
plan by mid-May to dismantle the Contras, most of whom are in
jungle camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   In the pact, Ortega promised legal reforms to guarantee fair
general elections, which he moved up by 10 months, to Feb. 25,
1990. The first stage of the reforms is supposed to be in place by
April 25.
   ``Only 11 days remain before the deadline established'' at the
El Salvador meeting, the State Department said in a statement.
   ``We hope the government of Nicaragua will engage in a genuine
dialogue to achieve a national consensus on necessary reforms,''
the statement said.
   ``It is increasingly clear that the Sandinistas' conduct must be
closely scrutinized by all who care about the future of democracy
in Nicaragua,'' it said.
   Such scrutiny was one of the main motives cited by supporters of
the compromise Contra aid package in Congress, who hope it will put
the Sandinista leadership under intense international pressure to
keep its promises.

   Most of the 12,000 Sinhalese in
Trincomalee took refuge in a navy dockyard Friday, one day after a
car bomb in the port city killed 39 Sinhalese shoppers marking the
Buddhist New Year, military officials said.
   Two Tamils also were killed in the blast from 110 pounds of
explosives, which the military blamed on militants from the island
nation's Tamil minority.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne visited the town Friday
and said security lapses by Indian peacekeeping troops and Sri
Lankan forces allowed the booby-trapped car to enter the port city
150 miles northeast of Colombo.
   Police patrolling the streets reported no new violence but kept
a curfew imposed after Thursday's explosion.
   Military officials in Colombo said three people died Friday of
injuries suffered in the explosion, which killed 36 Sinhalese and
two Tamils outright. At least 54 people were injured.
   Nalin Seneviratna, head of the northeastern provincial council,
said the explosives were hidden under a pile of coconuts in the
compact car.
   Shortly after it detonated, angry Sinhalese attacked Tamils,
stabbing at least four to death, he said. Seven others were
injured, said Seneviratna, who is Sinhalese.
   The blast destroyed a hotel and flattened three shops.
   Police evacuated Trincomalee's Sinhalese residents to the World
War II-era dockyard for their safety, Sri Lankan officials said on
condition of anonymity.
   Tamils account for 60 percent of the town's 35,000 people, while
Sinhalese make up 35 percent. There is a small Moslem minority.
   Wijeratne said the government has ordered an investigation of
the security lapses, which he refused to detail.
   Sri Lankan military officials blamed the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front for the blast, while Indian
officials blamed the largest Tamil guerrilla group, Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam. A spokesman for the Tigers in Colombo denied
responsibility.
   India became involved in the ethnic troubles of its southern
neighbor because sympathies of 60 million politically powerful
Tamils in south India lie with the guerrillas.
   Indian peacekeeping troops have been deployed in northern and
eastern Sri Lanka since July 1987 to disarm Tamil rebels and
enforce a peace accord.
   At least 12,500 people, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed in
the insurrection and a violent backlash from Sinhalese extremists
opposed to the accord.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Militants among them are fighting for an
independent state in northeastern Sri Lanka, where they are a
majority.
   They claim they are discriminated against by the mostly Buddhist
Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population and control the
government and military.
   Thursday's blast came on the second day of a one-week truce
offered by President Ranasinghe Premadasa to Sinhalese and Tamil
rebels willing to surrender their arms.

   A daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and a son of
Martin Luther King Jr. helped launch a campaign against capital
punishment on Friday, saying the death penalty will not bring their
slain fathers back to life.
   Society should put some killers in jail ``and leave them there
forever. But while we're at it, dismantle the electric chair, the
gas chamber. They won't bring back my father, they'll only take
someone else's father,'' said M. Kerry Kennedy of Boston, who was 8
when her father was killed in 1968.
   Other speakers during a meeting at the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change urged religious leaders to
become more active in mobilizing their congregations against the
death penalty.
   The campaign, called ``Lighting the Torch of Conscience,'' is
aimed at getting the religious community to confront the capital
punishment issue. It will culminate in June 1990 with a 330-mile
pilgrimage from Starke, Fla., where Florida's electric chair is
located, to Atlanta.
   Camille Bell, an Atlanta woman whose son Yusef, 9, was murdered
in 1979, also spoke against capital punishment. Yusef Bell was one
of more than 20 young black Atlantans whose deaths were attributed
by police to Wayne Williams, currently serving two life prison
terms for two of the killings.
   ``I know the pain I felt when Yusef died,'' Ms. Bell told the
gathering of about 100. ``No other mother should have to feel that
pain.''
   Martin Luther King III, a son of the slain civil rights leader,
said the execution of King assassin James Earl Ray ``would not
bring my father back.''
   ``If we believe in an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,
most of us would be without eyes and without teeth,'' he said.
   Friday's session opened with Delbert Tibbs, a former Florida
death row inmate, carrying a lighted torch from King's tomb into an
auditorium of the King center.
   Tibbs, convicted of murder and rape, spent two years on death
row before his conviction was overturned and he was freed in 1977.
   He urged people to ``listen to and be guided by that still,
small voice from within'' to work to solve crime problems without
the death penalty.
   Sister Helen Prejean of New Orleans, a death row spiritual
adviser and director of the Pilgrimage for Life program in her
hometown, said she had accompanied three men to the electric chair
and watched them die.
   ``They are the fire in me that is not going to go away until
things change,'' she said.

   Thousands of war veterans, some
scrawling anti-communist slogans with their blood, on Friday
denounced a dissident clergyman who visited communist North Korea
for reunification talks.
   At a rival protest, about 5,000 radical students hurled
firebombs and rocks as they battled police for a second day in
support of the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan.
   He was arrested Thursday on his return from an illegal 10-day
trip to North Korea that included meetings with communist leader
Kim Il Sung.
   The war veterans, numbering about 10,000, rallied in Seoul,
where they burned large effigies of Moon giving a bear hug to the
North Korean leader. TV broadcasts showing the embrace angered many
South Koreans who blame Kim for the 1950-53 Korean War that took
more than 1 million lives.
   Enraged veterans at the rally bit their fingers until they drew
blood, then scrawled slogans on posters that said: ``Crush leftist
leanings!'' and ``Protect democracy!''
   They began a mainly peaceful march on the presidential mansion,
demanding the government disband dissident groups and jail their
members.
   ``Destroy communists!'' they shouted. ``Execute the Moon Ik-hwan
clique!'' Riot police turned them away several blocks from the
mansion.
   Several veterans later delievered a letter to the prime
minister's office calling for stronger action to stamp out what
they called spreading left-wing sentiment.
   Preliminary charges filed against Moon, 71, carry the death
sentence under the tough national security law, which requires
South Koreans to get government permission to visit the north.
   Police earlier arrested 60 members of right-wing youth groups
who briefly occupied the Seoul offices of the country's biggest
dissident organization, the United National Democratic Movement,
which Moon advises.
   In Seoul and two provincial cities, Taegu and Kwangju, radical
students clashed with police firing tear gas. They demanded Moon's
release and the overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo.
   Police said some people were injured and others were arrested
during the demonstrations, but they gave no figures.
   Also Friday, state TV reported that dozens of students attacked
two police substations with firebombs and sticks, one in Seoul and
on in southern Taegu city. They smashed windows of the buildings,
it said. Few South Koreans share the views of the radical students.
   In a related development, police Friday said they arrested
newspaper executive Im Jae-kyung, accusing him of planning a trip
to North Korea to interview Kim. Police earlier arrested an
editorial writer for Im's opposition Hankyoreh newspaper. They say
he too wanted to visit Pyongyang without government approval.
   The two nations have been bitter rivals since the division of
the peninsula at the end of World War II. That enmity deepened when
North Korea invaded the south in 1950.

   Some Beirut residents ventured out of
hiding Friday after 20 hours of shelling and rocket fire subsided,
but sporadic mortar blasts kept many people off the streets and
delayed a French mercy mission.
   ``God knows what happened to my daughter and baby boy,'' said
Nada Makke, a bank employee, as she hurried down a Beirut street.
   ``I stayed at the bank all day and all night with five other
colleagues. I telephoned home several times but there was no
answer. The maid must have taken the kids to the basement,'' she
said.
   A police spokesman said 25,000 shells and rockets hit Beirut's
Moslem and Christian sectors in the duels that began Thursday
morning, the 14th anniversary of the outbreak of the civil war.
   Nineteen people were killed and 50 wounded in the exhanges,
which eased after the Arab League issued a cease-fire appeal _ its
third in the past month.
   By police count, 215 people have been killed and 727 wounded in
the confrontation that began March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's
Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse
militiamen.
   A source at the Moslem Cabinet of acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said two French navy vessels _ the hospital ship La Rance and
the oil tanker Penhors _ remained outside Lebanese waters because
of ``differences between local militias on the French assistance.''
   La Rance was scheduled to drop anchor in neutral Lebanese waters
Thursday afternoon to treat Moslem and Christian casualties.
   Penhors was last reported sailing toward power stations to
provide them with badly needed supplies of fuel oil.
   The source said Bernard Kouchner, the French minister for
humanitarian assistance, was ``exerting efforts to overcome the
difficulties and get the French mercy mission running.''
   Doctors have said the hospital ship would help ease the
pressures on the various hospitals in Beirut, especially those
caught in the fighting.
   Several shells hit the Saint Charles hospital in the Christian
suburb of Hazmiyeh on Thursday, forcing management to evacuate the
92 patients to other medical centers, police said.
   In Cyprus, an Italian tanker hit in Thursday's shelling anchored
off the port of Zighi with a gaping hole in its stern and a 20-man
crew described by the captain as ``in shock.''
   The Isola Azzurra was hit by an artillery shell while anchored
1.5 miles off Beirut. Capt. Alvaro Del Pisoia, said the vessel
carried 4,000 tons of sulfuric acid destined for a Lebanese firm.
   ``When the first shell landed in the sea, I didn't realize we
were the target. Then the second one fell after 30 seconds only 50
meters (yards) away,'' he said in a radio interview from a Cypriot
Coast Guard yacht.
   ``After the second shell I started heading off to open waters,
managing to escape the third shell, but not the forth which hit the
stern,'' Del Pisoia added. He sailed to Cyprus 100 miles west.
   The latest round of violence broke out after Aoun ordered a
blockade of militia-run ports that deprive the state treasury of
millions of dollars in tax revenues.
   The Progressive Socialist Party militia of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt shelled the 310-square-mile Christian enclave in
retaliation.
   Syrian gunners then joined their allies in bombarding Christian
regions, and Lebanese Moslem army troops besieged the
crescent-shaped Christian enclave, where 1 million Christians live.

<HEAD>School Board Refuses 16-Year-Old A Diploma Despite University Acceptance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LILBURN, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivana Markovic's high school record is good
enough for her to be accepted by five top-notch universities, but
not good enough for the state Board of Education to give her a
diploma.
   The board says she finished her high school work too quickly.
   Miss Markovic, 16, will enroll this fall at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, turning down Vanderbilt, Duke Emory and
Georgia Tech.
   But she'll do so without her Parkview High School diploma,
thanks to a 7-2 vote this week by the state school board, which
refused to bend its rule requiring all high school credits to be
earned in high school.
   Miss Markovic, a Yugoslavian native who speaks three languages,
took two of her high school courses in middle school, so they don't
count, even though she made A's in both.
   ``The funny thing is that I have all the academic courses
required for high school graduation,'' said Miss Markovic. ``I need
just two electives to earn my diploma.''
   ``I understand she is a brilliant student, (but) she simply
doesn't have enough credits to earn a high school diploma,'' said
board member Hollis Q. Lathem.
   Larry A. Foster Sr., another board member, said the board's
philosophy is that students Miss Markovic's age are better off in
high school.
   Miss Markovic's father, Milan, said the ruling illustrates how
Georgia fails its gifted students.
   ``They have options for students who failed that allow these
students to go to summer school or take class at night so they can
graduate on time,'' he said. ``But they don't have any policy in
place to help students who are motivated and complete the
requirements ahead of time.''
   Markovic said he might appeal the decision to the state Supreme
Court. He has a daughter in the eighth grade who could face the
same dilemma in a few years.
   Meanwhile, MIT has said it would admit Miss Markovic without her
Parkview diploma.
   ``All my plans are just as they were before the board's
ruling,'' said Miss Markovic, who wants to be a genetic researcher.
``I know I can handle college. I know what I can do.''

   Florence and John Hoffman wanted their son to be a
doctor. Instead, he became the wisecracking founder of the radical
Yippie movement, horrifying his father as he ducked underground in
skirmishes with the establishment.
   Having Abbie Hoffman as a son could be difficult, but it was a
relationship spiced with adventure and an indomitable humor, his
mother recalled Friday.
   ``He had a wonderful sense of humor. He loved every funny book
he could put his hands on,'' she said.
   ``I never thought he was going to become famous. I never had
that in mind,'' Mrs. Hoffman, 83, said in a telephone interview
from her home in Worcester.
   Hoffman, 52, was found dead Wednesday in his bed at his
apartment in New Hope, Pa.
   An autopsy on Hoffman was inconclusive and officials said they
would not know the results of toxicology tests until next week at
the earliest.
   Mrs. Hoffman said her son had been troubled, but she didn't
believe he had killed himself.
   ``My son knew that he had problems,'' Mrs. Hoffman said. ``They
found no drugs around him. I think suicide may be ruled out.''
   A memorial service was planned for Wednesday at Temple Emanuel
in Worcester, the synagogue Hoffman attended as a child.
   Hoffman became famous with the Chicago Seven, a group of
radicals who stood trial on charges of conspiring to disrupt the
1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was acquitted of
conspiracy and a conviction of crossing state lines with intent to
riot was overturned.
   He also founded the loosely organized Yippie movement, or Youth
International Party, in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest
the government and the Vietnam War.
   John Hoffman, a pharmacist who worked long hours running a
medical supply company, could never accept his son's outlaw status,
Mrs. Hoffman said.
   ``My husband took it really hard,'' she said. ``When he was
underground, my husband just couldn't take the news when this
happened.'' He died while his son was in hiding to avoid trial on
cocaine charges.
   ``Of course everyone has ambitions. I wanted him to be a good
student and be able to make it in life. Maybe I was over ambitious.
Maybe we both were,'' Mrs. Hoffman said.
   The Hoffmans drove Abbie to Brandeis University for an interview
at the medical school, but instructors advised that he was better
at mathematics than medicine. At Brandeis, Hoffman's interests
turned to psychology.
   Mrs. Hoffman credited Brandeis, a cradle of 1960s activism, with
Hoffman's emergence as a radical leader.
   Hoffman never followed the conventional path his parents had
envisioned, but Mrs. Hoffman said she was always sure of his
affection.
   ``Yes he did love me and I loved him too,'' she said. ``But what
can you do? Things happen in your life.''

<TEXT>
   U.N. officials and Namibia's South
African-appointed administrator extended to April 21 the deadline
for 900 black nationalist guerrillas to withdraw to Angola to
salvage an independence plan.
   ``A prolonged stalemate in the affected areas is in no one's
interest,'' said a joint statement.
   Also on Friday, territorial officials said 13 guerrillas have
been killed in battles with security forces.
   It was the first official report of fighting between South
African-led security forces and guerrillas of the South-West Africa
People's Organization since last weekend, when the two sides agreed
SWAPO fighters would safely withdraw from Namibia.
   Gerhard Roux, spokesman for administrator Louis Pienaar, said
security forces also found the bodies of another six insurgents in
the bush of northern Namibia this week. But he said it is not known
when they died.
   Paramilitary police and soldiers killed five guerrillas in a
Thursday confrontation and two on Tuesday, Roux told reporters.
   Fighting erupted April 1, the first day of a cease-fire starting
a yearlong U.N. process to make Namibia independent. Since then,
territorial officials say, 276 guerrillas and 27 security force
members have been killed. SWAPO says its losses are much lower and
charges one-fifth of those killed were civilians.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Friday that 1,600
guerrillas have infiltrated into northern Namibia from Angola since
April 1 and must be accounted for before the independence process
can move ahead.
   Of those, about 350 have withdrawn from Namibia, 22 have been
captured, and about 900 remain in the territory, Botha said.
   No explanation was given for his new estimate of 1,600
infiltrators, down from 1,900.
   The incursion has jeopardized plans to hold independence
elections in November, Botha has said.
   Last weekend, South African, Cuban and Angolan officials
negotiated safe passage back to Angola for guerrillas who report to
U.N.-monitored checkpoints.
   The previous deadline for the guerrilla withdrawal was Saturday.
   As of Friday evening, however, only five guerrillas had
reported. Others who withdrew apparently did so on their own.
   U.N. official Cedric Thornberry said Thursday the insurgents
probably are reluctant to surface because of the ``menacing
presence'' of security forces near U.N. assembly points.
   The cease-fire has not been reinstated since last week's
fighting, the fiercest in the 23-year war, although South Africa
says its forces will fire at guerrillas only if attacked.
   Botha also agreed with the United Nations that South African
soldiers not be allowed to interrogate guerrillas who report to the
checkpoints. Some South African soldiers tried to get access to
four guerrillas at a checkpoint Thursday, but Australian and
British members of the U.N. monitoring force rebuffed them.
   U.N. investigators have supported South Africa's contention that
the guerrillas violated an accord requiring they stay at Angolan
bases at least until May 15, when they could enter Namibia as
unarmed refugees.
   Exiled SWAPO President Sam Nujoma has called on his fighters to
withdraw but has not told them to report to the checkpoints.
   South Africa has ruled this mineral-rich territory since it
captured it from Germany in World War I. In December, it agreed to
begin a transition to independence in exchange for Cuba withdrawing
50,000 troops from Angola.
   SWAPO has fought South African rule since 1966 and is favored to
get the most votes in independence elections. But it is uncertain
whether it will get the two-thirds support needed to win full
control of a new government.

<HEAD>Virginia's Governor Saw Gold Mine in Chicken Feet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles was struck, he
recalled Friday, by the chicken feet he saw frequently at meals
during a trade mission to the Far East.
   When he got home, he said, he asked Virginia chicken producers
what they did with the feet of chickens they process.
   ``They laughed,'' Baliles recounted, ``and said they're cut off
and thrown away. I said, `I think we've found a new market.'''
   As a result, Baliles told fellow governors Friday, Virginia now
exports 40 tons of chicken feet and related products every month to
foreign markets where they are more valued.
   Baliles, a Democrat and chairman of the National Governors'
Association, cited the chicken-feet example as he and several
colleagues released a report saying governors should do more to
encourage international exports by businesses within their states.
   The report by the association's task force on foreign markets
said states must develop new links with foreign countries if their
citizens are to succeed in a future economy that will be
increasingly dependent on international trade.
   It suggested states and governors:
   _ Come up with their own targeted plan for finding new markets
for producers and service-providing companies within their own
states, and encouraging development of products in demand by
foreign nations.
   _ Elevate foreign trade to a top priority and increase public
awareness of the connections between their own economy and
international markets.
   _ Appoint ``trade czars,'' an official in each state with
cabinet-level rank who would direct and coordinate its plan for
encouraging international trade.
   _ Help firms obtain financing for export deals, either through
direct state loans and loan-guarantee programs, or by serving as
brokers and clearinghouses to match commercial lenders with
businesses. Some states are already serving as loan brokers.
   _ Consider pooling resources for trade and tourism promotion in
groups of states, as Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas have done
to promote their products jointly.
   ``We can do something about international competition,'' Baliles
said. ``We can develop an export culture. We can develop programs
that identify markets.
   The governors released their report as part of a day-long
conference on increasing business dealings between states and
developing nations. It came on a day when the Commerce Department
announced a worsening trade deficit for the United States, with the
gap between merchandise imports and exports swelling by 20.9
percent, to $10.5 billion, in February.
   ``While the federal government sets the rules on trade, success
in developing and expanding foreign markets depends on the
decisions of thousands of corporations and business people,''
Baliles said. ``State governments are positioned to help.''
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, who headed the task force, said his
state has just begun pushing exports and has had success in selling
Mississippi catfish to the Soviet Union.
   Mabus, a Democrat, said Baliles told him his chicken story
earlier.
   ``I went back and talked to my chicken producers,'' Mabus said.
``Now we sell as much chicken feet as Virginia does.''

   A former spokesman for the Charter
77 human rights group was released from jail Friday, and an emigre
source said he was hospitalized after a 28-day hunger strike.
   Stanislav Devaty was released because ``the reasons for his
detention have ceased to exist. The investigation on his activity
continues,'' the state-run CTK news agency quoted the prosecutor's
office in Brno, Moravia, as saying. It did not elaborate.
   Devaty, 37, had been detained since March 16. Human rights
activists said authorities intended to bring incitement charges
against Devaty in connection with a petition he organized last fall
calling for freedom for political prisoners in Czechoslovakia.
   An emigre source in Vienna said Devaty was in a civilian
hospital in his hometown of Gottwaldow following his release.
   ``He resumed eating Friday for the first time in 28 days, but
his health is not very good,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The source said she learned of Devaty's
condition from a nurse at the Gottwaldow hospital.
   The source said Devaty lost 33 pounds during his hunger strike,
which included 24 days when he drank only water and four days when
he took tea and vitamins.
   Charter 77, the Soviet bloc's oldest, unofficial human rights
organization, was formed in January 1977. It was named for the
document issued by founding members calling on Czechoslovakia to

   A committee of the American Society of
Newspaper editors has selected 14 small newspapers for recognition
as the best in the United States.
   James Herman, editor of the Traverse City, Mich., Record-Eagle,
announced the results at a program on excellence in small
newspapers at the society's convention here Thursday.
   The papers selected are the Ann Arbor, Mich., News; the
Alexandria, La., Town Talk; the Biloxi, Miss., Sun-Herald; the
Central Maine Morning Sentinel of Waterville, Maine; the Cape Cod
Times of Hyannis, Mass.; the Concord Monitor of Concord, N.H.; The
Express of Easton, Pa.; the Gloucester County Times of Woodbury,
N.J.; the Gwinnett Daily News, Lawrenceville, Ga.; the Jackson,
Tenn., Sun; the Leesburg, Fla., Daily Commercial; the Middlesex
News of Framingham, Mass.; the Owensboro, Ky., Messenger-Inquirer;
and the St. Cloud, Minn., Times.
   The newspapers were selected in a two-stage process from among
1,357 papers of under 50,000 circulation in the country.
   Last year, Jean Abbott of the University of Missouri School of
Journalism conducted a survey in which editors of all of the
newspapers were asked to name the three outstanding ones in their
states.
   Herman said he then asked the editors of the 150 papers selected
by this process to submit copies of their papers, which they did in
February.
   A panel of judges named by Herman selected what they considered
outstanding examples from among these submissions.

<HEAD>Soviet Sub Was Conducting Experiments When Disaster Broke Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet nuclear-powered submarine was testing
deep sea dives and conducting scientific experiments when it caught
fire and sank off Norway, Tass said Friday.
   The official news agency said investigators have come up with
four probable causes of April 7 disaster, which killed 42 of the 69
sailors aboard, but it did not list them. It also said a decision
on whether to salvage the submarine could take months.
   In Oslo, Norwegian experts said the sub's nuclear reactors and
weapons are apparently intact in the vessel on the ocean floor.
   Eight water samples collected near the sunken vessel, 5,000 feet
beneath the ocean surface, detected no radiation leakage, said
Norway's National Institute of Radiation Protection.
   Tass said the submarine was an experimental vessel that was
testing deep dives and unusual materials when the accident happened.
   ``The test program covered a total of 12 scientific and
technological problems and even in the short time during which the
submarine was put through its paces, it produced exceptional
research results,'' it said without elaboration.
   The Soviet nuclear-powered vessel is thought to be one of that
country's most advanced submarines.
   A decision on whether to attempt to raise the submarine will not
be made for several months, Tass said, quoting Deputy Prime
Minister Igor Belovsov.
   Several officials at a news conference Thursday for Soviet
journalists blamed the severity of the fire on the flow of
high-pressure air into the burning compartment, Tass said, but the
cause of the fire is unknown.
   ``Experts have identified four most probable causes of the sub's
loss, but won't yet make the final conclusion,'' Tass said. It
quoted Belovsov as saying the government commission investigating
the accident agreed on the need to develop new sea rescue
techniques and lifesaving equipment.
   The Norweigan institute said the vessel apparently withstood
tremendous water pressure and explosions that sank the ship.
   The Soviets have said the submarine's two reactors were shut
down before the crew evacuated and that neither of the two
nuclear-tipped torpedoes was armed for combat. They said there was
no danger of radioactivity being released from the sunken vessel.
   But the institute said it may collect more water samples.
Deepwater currents may have prevented accurate detection of
radioactivity, said Johan Baarli, director of the government
institute.
   Earlier tests taken near the sub, 310 miles off Norway's
northern coast, showed no atmospheric contamination from the
sinking.

   Anti-nuclear protesters tried to block traffic
in and out of the Nevada Test Site on Friday, and 65 people were
arrested on misdemeanor nuisance charges when they failed to move
from the site's main road.
   Forty others were arrested on trespass charges during the night.
   Friday's arrests bring to 452 the number of citations issued
since the annual ``Reclaim the Test Site'' protest began April 7
and ending Sunday.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer said 400 protesters showed
up near the gates to the site Thursday night and 200 of them sat
down on the main road and blocked buses and cars carrying workers
to and from the secret desert site.
   The traffic was rerouted and the protesters were allowed to
remain until dawn, when they were told they would be arrested if
they did not move.
   Boyer said no major traffic delays were reported Friday.
   Chris Brown of the sponsoring American Peace Test said the
protesters hoped to block workers from the test site.
   Nye County officials say they will no longer prosecute
protesters who are cited for misdemeanor violations at the remote
desert because of the growing number of protests against the
nation's nuclear testing program.

<HEAD>Baker Says Gorbachev Running Risks With Economic Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Friday that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's critics may try to stifle his
economic reform program unless he succeeds in getting ``consumer
goods on the table and in the markets.''
   Baker said that the political reforms Gorbachev has pushed as
part of ``perestroika,'' or resturcturing, are progressing faster
than his economic reforms.
   ``That might trigger something,'' he said. ``These things
generally have to proceed apace.''
   Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the
secretary commented:
   ``If they are unable to get the economic part of this going and
going well so there are consumer goods on the table and in the
markets, that's going to give rise, I suppose, to some feelings on
the part of some that this idea of perestroika doesn't mean much to
the common man or woman in the Soviet Union.''
   Baker said Gorbachev's program entails risks to him from
opponents of change, entrenched elements of the Soviet bureaucracy
and ``sources of nationalistic discontent.''
   The secretary, who will meet with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze next month in Moscow, said that a
reversal of perestroika ``would be unfortunate.''
   Unless the West adopts an ``obstructionist approach'' to the
Soviet Union, he said, ``it's our view that whether or not
perestroika succeeds will depend on what happens in the Soviet
Union and not on what we in the West might do or might not do.''
   Answering a subsequent question, Baker said:
   ``We very much want perestroika to succeed and we very much want
the general secretary to succeed. We think that's in the best
interest of the United States and the best interest of the world.
...''
   Just this week, a Moscow newspaper said sugar rationing would
begin in the Soviet capital for the first time since World War II.
   And the daily Socialist Industry said earlier this month that
many Soviet citizens ``can expect that the year 1989 will be the
most unsuccessful of all those we have lived through. ... The bony
hand of hunger for products is quite capable of strangling
perestroika.''
   Addressing the editors, Baker mixed praise of Gorbachev and
perestroika with a complaint that ``there remain too many areas
where the slogans of new thinking lack content.''
   For instance, Baker said he intended to confront the Soviet
leaders with their recent sale of high-performance bombers to Libya.
   Repeating U.S. charges that the North African country supports
terrorism, Baker asked, ``How does this sale assist in the
worldwide efforts, supposedly supported by Moscow, to control
chemical weapons that Libya is developing at its Rabta plant?''
   He also renewed U.S. demands that the Berlin Wall be torn down
and that the Soviets repudiate the Brezhnev Doctrine, which asserts
a right to intervene in East European countries.

   Three bombs exploded Friday in
the master bedroom and dining room of Vice President-elect
Francisco Merino's home, slightly injuring a child and causing
extensive damage, police said.
   Merino and his wife, Maria Antonieta, were visiting the United
States, but the couple's four young children and three friends were
sleeping in the house in affluent Maquilishuat suburb when it was
bombed at dawn. The injured child, who was cut by a piece of
debris, was a friend of Merino's children.
   Seven or eight men raced up in two cars, lobbed 2{-pound blocks
of TNT over a wall surrounding the garden, and sped away, a
policeman quoted witnesses as saying. Three bombs exploded and the
other was deactivated later, he said on condition of anonymity.
   President-elect Alfredo Cristiani blamed the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front when he visited the house afer the
attack. An anonymous caller told a radio station the rebels were
not responsible.
   The caller said they had nothing to do with the attack ``even
though Merino is one of those who is promoting terror, repression
and slaughter of our people, and we consider that he deserves this
and much more.''
   The Marxist-led insurgents have fought nine years against the
U.S.-backed government.
   Cristiani said the bombing ``demonstrates that they are savages
who are not interested in peace, but only interested in terrorizing
the civilian population. I think very little can be achieved, as
far as pacifying the country, through dialogue with these kind of
people.''
   Cristiani and Merino, of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, were elected March 19. They take office June 1 from
Christian Democratic President Jose Napoleon Duarte.
   Merino was to return to El Salvador later Friday.

<HEAD>North ``Frantic'' for Cash in 1984, Jury Hears as Testimony Concludes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 48 witnesses and nearly 11 weeks,
testimony ended in the Oliver North trial Friday with a witness
describing a ``pretty frantic'' North so strapped for cash in 1984
that he complained of not having enough for lunch or gasoline.
   But, said Mary Dix who controlled expense money at the National
Security Council, all that stopped in 1985 _ a time when North had
in his office safe a huge revolving fund for expenses having to do
with the Nicaraguan Contras.
   After hearing her and four other rebuttal witnesses, the judge
sent jurors home for a long weekend and told them to return Tuesday
for final arguments expected to take most of two days. He said they
would be sequestered as soon as they begin deliberations.
   Mrs. Dix said North, in 1984, was after her to reimburse him for
taxi fares and other expenses quickly.
   ``He would run by and his face was red and he was very upset
with my staff if for some reason they didn't have money,'' she
said. ``He would say he didn't have enough cash to go home or he
didn't have lunch money. He was pretty frantic that we turn them
(the expense accounts) around as fast as we could because his
credit cards were charged to the max.''
   Once, she said, he ran after her in a hallway yelling ``Mary,
Mary.''
   Her description of North, then earning $50,000 as a Marine
lieutenant colonel, was at odds with North's own testimony. He said
that since he was a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, he had a
family fund of as much as $15,000, stashed in a metal box bolted to
the floor in a closet at home.
   North is charged with profiting illegally from his Iran-Contra
dealings, including an accusation that he diverted Contra
traveler's checks to his own use. He is also accused of lying to
Congress and the attorney general about his activities.
   The jury, which had heard a succession of witnesses who included
a congressman, an attorney general, a national security adviser, a
Contra leader and a number of CIA agents in an eight-week period,
also heard Friday from a used car salesman.
   William Howell also contradicted a North account, in this case
in connection with how North came to buy a used car in October 1985
for $8,038, for cash. North said he went to the lot in Tyson's
Corner, Va., to buy a station wagon, then saw a heavier vehicle and
settled on that, paying $5,000 down and the balance four days
later, all in cash from the box.
   Howell recalled, however, that North telephoned him three times,
responding to a newspaper ad for the car, a 1982 Chevrolet
Suburban, a heavy-duty vehicle with 51,000 miles.
   ``He inquired about the vehicle, indicating he had a necessity
to tow a horse trailer,'' Howell said. The oldest daughter of
North's four children rode horses in competitions.
   To a question by assistant prosecutor David Zornow about what
North said about paying the balance, Howell said, ``It was my
understanding the money was to come from the White House Credit
Union.''
   Howell said North later gave him, his wife, daughter and parents
a tour of the White House when it was decorated for Christmas.
   Willard Zucker, who previously testified, was brought back for
further questioning Friday. He is an American living in Switzerland
who set up bank accounts for Albert Hakim, a business partner of
North's co-defendant Richard Secord. Zucker said he was asked by
Hakim to sound North's wife out about helping his children with
their education.
   North had explained that Hakim had wanted to provide for his
family if something happened to him on his dangerous, clandestine
mission to Tehran in 1986 and had told him only that Mrs. North was
to meet Hakim's lawyer.
   ``I said to her I have been requested by some of our clients, I
didn't identify them, to obtain certain information from her about
her children ... for the purpose of seeing whether there was some
possibility of being some assistance with respect to their
education,'' Zucker testified.
   Also testifying Friday was Stephen E. Berry, associate counsel
in 1986 of the House Intelligence Committee. He said North had told
a meeting of the committee in August that year that he had
installed a security system at his home at his own expense.
   One of the charges against North is that he accepted an illegal
gratuity _ the $13,800 system, which was paid for by Secord _ and
then tried to hide that fact by backdating two letters to the
contractor.

<TEXT>
   Just as George Bush refused to discuss his
private chats with President Reagan, Vice President Dan Quayle
wouldn't say Friday what he and Bush talk about in the White House
inner sanctum.
   But during a question-and-answer session with members of the
audience at the American Society of Newspaper Editors convention,
Quayle did provide some insights into how Bush conducts himself
during these high-level meetings.
   ``He enjoys the give and take,'' Quayle said. ``He enjoys having
ideas put forward, whether it be by me or by others. He enjoys the
competition of ideas and discussion of policy and where we ought to
be going.''
   Quayle, however, declined to respond when asked to cite what
differences he may have had with the president in the nearly three
months they've been in office.
   ``I'm not going to get into private conversations that I have
with the president and what kind of influence and how I think I can
influence his decisions,'' Quayle said. ``It wouldn't be
appropriate. I've decided not to do it _ and if I did engage, and
do it, I would lose my effectiveness.''
   When he was campaigning for the presidency, Bush steadfastly
refused, in debate and in exchanges with reporters, to discuss
whatever he might have said to Reagan or what Reagan might have
said to him.
   This question arose frequently in the context of what Bush knew
about the Iran-Contra scandal and what role he might have played in
it.
   Quayle also said Friday he's pleased with the access he has to
the president.
   ``I have the right to go into his office anytime,'' he said,
adding that he has had several one-on-one meetings with Bush in
addition to their regular Thursday lunches.
   Asked to compare his vice presidential style with that of Bush,
Quayle told the audience that ``from the operational point of view
... it is essentially the same type of vice presidency.''
   ``Now, obviously, I'm a different individual than President
Bush, and obviously, in a period of time, you will have a Quayle
model of the vice presidency,'' he said. ``We're just starting.''
   ``I would say from a philosophical and an ideological point of
view, that there is from a practical point of view, no difference
at all,'' he said. But Quayle also said, ``Obviously in style, in
rhetoric, things of that sort, we will approach the job in a
different manner.''

<HEAD>U.S. Still Sees Jewish Settlements As Impediments to Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department spokeswoman said Friday
that the United States still views Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza as impediments to peace, and urged Palestinians and
Israelis to refrain from exacerbating their tensions.
   The comments by department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
followed Thursday's clash in the occupied West Bank village of
Nahalin in which Israeli forces shot and killed at least five
Palestinians in one of the bloodiest incidents of the 16-month
Palestinian uprising.
   An estimated 80,000 Jews live in settlements among an estimated
1.7 million Palestinians, but settlement construction has been
scaled back in recent years by budgetary and political constraints.
   Under an agreement reached by partners in Israel's coalition
government last year, the first of eight new settlements went up
last week in the West Bank, not far from the village.
   In response to reports that the United States had changed its
policy on Jewish settlements, Ms. Tutwiler said, ``there is no
change in our policy. Our policy remains what it has been.
   ``We continue to believe that new settlements do not contribute
to a climate that can promote the peace process,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said ``the loss of life and injuries which occurred
... yesterday is tragic. We urge all sides to refrain from engaging
in confrontations that lead to the unnecessary loss of life.''
   The United States, she said, wants ``to see the violence stopped
and see steps taken that can begin to defuse the tension on the
ground.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III passed a similar message
to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir during Shamir's recent
visit. Shamir proposed holding elections among the Palestinians as
one tension-reducing step.
   But the Palestine Liberation Organization has rejected any
slowing of the Palestinian uprising until Israel withdraws from the
lands it captured in the 1967 war.
   Meantime, the State Department registered opposition to any
effort to grant the PLO membership in the United Nations.
   ``In our view, the self-declared Palestinian state, which we do
not recognize, does not meet the generally accepted international
law criteria for statehood,'' a department statement said. It added
that the PLO ``does not qualify for membership in U.N. agencies.''
   The statement responded to a letter by 38 senators urging Baker
to oppose U.N. recognition of the PLO as a member state, an
upgrading of its current observer status.
   In New York, the PLO's permanent observer Zuhdi Labib Terzi told
The Associated Press that his organization was not considering
applying to the U.N. for membership now. ``That would be
premature,'' he said.
   ``We have not yet gone to the Security Council to apply,'' he
said. ``We are not that stupid when the U.S. holds a veto'' over
the council's decisions.
   The State Department also addressed the latest violence in
Lebanon.
   In a departure from previous statements, the State Department
named Syria as one of the parties being urged to cease fire in
Beirut. Until now, repeated U.S. urgings for calm in Lebanon have
failed to name Syria, referring to it only as a warring party.
   ``We condemn the savage shelling in Beirut on Thursday. It was a
reprehensible reminder that 14 years of armed conflict have failed
to solve Lebanon's problems,'' said a department statement.
   ``We reprove all participants in yesterday's fighting, both
Lebanese and non-Lebanese. We call on all combatants, including the
Lebanese armed forces, the different militias and the Syrian army
to cease fire,'' it said.
   The statement also called on Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun
to pursue his recent proposal for power-sharing talks with
Lebanon's Moslem majority, saying Moslem Prime Minister Salim
al-Hoss should take Aoun up on his offer.
   In an apparent reference to Aoun's stated intention of expelling
the 40,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon, the statement said that
``force will not unite the Lebanese, neither will it cause foreign
troops to withdraw.''

   A British Airways Boeing 737
carrying 84 passengers came within 15 feet of colliding with a
small plane that veered into its path this week, aviation officials
said Friday.
   Three flight attendants were injured when the jet pilot suddenly
changed course to avoid the private plane, according to the federal
aviation safety office.
   The incident occurred Tuesday as the jet was preparing to land
in Duesseldorf on a regular flight from London. It was at an
altitude of 10,000 feet when the pilot saw a single-engine plane
enter his flight path, said Hans-Ulrich Ohl, a spokesman for the
flight safety office.
   The captain executed a maneuver and flew about 15 feet over the
small plane, Ohl said. The jet landed safely.
   Ohl said the small plane's presence in the area was ``completely
legal.'' The plane was not identified, he said.
   Ohl also said the jet pilot had done nothing wrong.
   He said his information came from the pilot of the British
Airways jet. The incident was being investigated.

   A group of Armenians is seeking permission from
Moscow authorities to stage a march in memory of Armenians who were
killed by the Turks between 1915 and 1920, a group member said
Friday.
   Karen Saakian said he submitted an application to the Moscow
City Council to stage the march April 24 to commemorate ``the first
mass genocide of the 20th Century.'' The group vowed to stage the
march even if it is denied permission.
   Memorial services generally are held each year in Armenia to
honor the dead.
   The Ottomans accused the Armenians living in eastern Turkey of
helping the invading Russians during World War I and ordered the
Armenian population deported to Syria.
   Armenians were rounded up, their homes destroyed and their
property seized. Hundreds of thousands died from beatings,
starvation and exposure during the trip.
   Armenians have said 1.5 million died, but Turkish officials have
disputed that figure, saying there were only 1.4 million Armenians
living in Turkey at the turn of the century. They claim about
300,000 Armenians were killed. Historians have estimated 600,000
dead.
   Saakian said the group put in its application for the march
Thursday but had not received an answer.

   Pope John Paul II met Friday with the
president of the Ivory Coast, who said he came to Rome to offer the
Roman Catholic leader a basilica he is building in his West African
nation.
   Other than describing the meeting as ``very cordial,'' the
Vatican released no details of the private half-hour audience with
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   No one from the African delegation could be reached to see if
the president had indeed made his offer about the basilica, which
will be Africa's biggest center for Christian worship and only
slightly smaller than St. Peter's in Rome, Christendom's largest
basilica.
   After Friday's audience, the pope gave the president an icon of
the Black Madonna, revered throughout Poland, the pontiff's native
country. The African leader gave the pontiff two blocks of marble
from the Ivory Coast basilica.
   The $130 million Notre Dame Peace basilica in Yamoussoukro is
expected to be inaugurated later this year.
   Vatican officials say the pope has no intention of attending the
ceremony, an attitude some have taken as a sign of disapproval for
such opulence during the Ivory's Coast worst economic crisis in 28
years of independence.
   While visiting Paris in March, Houphouet-Boigny said that when
he met the pope he would ask him to accept the basilica in the name
of the Vatican.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16th round of talks on the future of
U.S. military bases in Greece ended Friday without making any
progress, a government spokesman said.
   The talks on a new defense and economic cooperation agreement,
which began Monday, stumbled on Greece's insistence the United
States help Athens solve differences with neighboring Turkey,
spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos said.
   U.S. negotiators said they don't want regional disputes wound
into the bilateral talks.
   Greece and Turkey have longstanding quarrels over seabed mineral
rights, military control of the Aegean sea and the war-divided
Mediterranean island of Cyprus.
   Another issue clouding the talks is Greece's reluctance to
extradite a suspected Palestinian terrorist, Mohammed Rashid,
wanted by the United States for the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo
jet, Kostopoulos said. The blast killed a Japanese teen-ager and
injured 15 other passengers.
   Rashid is in Athens' top-security prison awaiting a decision on
the extradition from Greece's Supreme Court. The decision has been
delayed three times since the 34-year-old Palestinian was arrested
at the Athens Airport.
   The United States may cut its military aid to Greece if Rashid
is not extradited, U.S. diplomats have said.
   The five-year base agreement expired Dec. 20. Under the accord,
the United States has 17 months to leavrsal from the Reagan
administration, raised environmental concerns about the sale of oil
and gas leases in the three offshore areas _ off the southern and
northern California coastlines and off southern Florida in the Gulf
of Mexico.
   In each case, environmentalists have vigorously fought oil
exploration, arguing the lease sites are too close to
environmentally fragile and important ecosystems.
   The president directed that the lease sales, which were
scheduled to begin this year and next, be put on hold until a
further environmental impact study by the task force can be
completed. The group plans to report to the president by the end of
the year.
   Lujan rejected suggestions by some environmental groups that the
task force is biased toward oil development. Environentalists had
wanted environmental groups, fishermen and the Florida and
California state governments represented, but were rebuffed.
   ``We think it' very well balanced'' said Lujan. The task force
includes representatives from the interior and energy departments
as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration. The National Academy of Sciences
serves as a consultant.
   Lujan said that the Alaska spill has made it imperative to take
a close look at transportation and emergency response issues in
considering the environmental questions surrounding oil drilling in
the three lease areas.
   Robert Kallman, executive director of the task force, said in
some cases the government might require pipelines to be built
instead of using supertankers such as the one that ran aground in
Alaska.
   Kallman said that while the southern California area is most
suited for transporting oil through pipelines, the industry likely
would want to opt for tanker transportation in the northern
California and Florida fields.
   Kallman recently resigned as director of the Minerals Management
Service at the Interior Department where he was responsible for
managing the federal offshore oil and gas leasing program. He
described himself Friday as a supporter of offshore drilling ``as
long as it's environmentally possible and feasible.''
   The three lease areas were to be put up for sale this year or
early next year until Bush called for additional environmental
studies. Officials acknowledge that opposition is likely to become
more intense after the Alaska spill.
   In the lease area under review off the Florida coast, oil
companies already have purchased 73 leases for more than $100
million, but have been prevented from drilling by a moratorium
imposed by Congress. The task force study covers only leases that
have not yet been sold, so oil companies would be free to drill on
the 73 leases they already own when the congressional moratorium
expires in October.
   But Lujan said Friday he would be strongly opposed to any such
drilling prior to completion of the task force report. He suggested
that ``anybody with an ounce of brains'' would think twice before
going ahead with drilling before the task force report is completed
and a decision is made by the president on whether to go ahead with
selling additional leases.

   Former Interior Minister Karl Blecha
resigned from public office Friday amid mounting criticism of his
role in a $16 million scandal involving the mysterious sinking of a
ship.
   Socialist Chancellor Franz Vranitzky hinted he had wanted the
resignations from Blecha, 55, who once was one of the most powerful
figures in the Socialist Party.
   Blecha should have resigned all his offices when he quit as
interior minister on Jan. 19, Vranitzky told reporters.
   On Friday, the beleaguered politician stepped down as a
parliamentary deputy and deputy party chairman.
   His loss of parliamentary immunity means Blecha can be
prosecuted in connection with the so-called Lucona scandal. Austria
Press Agency quoted Blecha as saying he resigned so he can fight
the allegations.
   ``The decision had to be made,'' said Vranitzky, who in the past
year has forced the resignations of at least two senior party men
over financial irregularities.
   Blecha is accused of ordering police to stop investigating the
scandal, and of influencing witnesses to a parliamentary commission
looking into possible insurance fraud connected to the 1977 sinking
of the Lucona in the Indian Ocean. Six sailors died.
   Blecha denies aiding Udo Proksch, a fugitive who is the main
suspect in the sinking. Proksch is wanted on murder and fraud
charges.
   The Lucona's cargo was listed as materials for a uranium
processing plant and was insured for $16 million. The insurance
company claims the cargo was scrap metal. It refuses to pay.
   Leopold Gratz, another powerful Socialist Party official accused
of aiding Proksch, resigned as president of parliament Jan. 25.
Both men deny wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe announced Friday
the resignations of four more senior politicians linked to a
corruption scandal.
   ``I feel let down. But when we condemn them let us not forget
that everyone has a balance sheet, good and bad,'' Mugabe told a
news conference.
   ``I am still proud of them. All these men are good men, by and
large,'' he said of Higher Education Minister Dzingai Mutumbuka;
Industry and Technology Minister Callistus Ndlovu; Matabeleland
North Gov. Jacob Mudenda; and Charles Ndlovu, the deputy minister
of sport and culture.
   Their resignations brought to seven the number of politicians
who have quit over their involvement in purchasing cars and trucks
from the black market. Their involvement was exposed by police, the
press and a special judicial commission that Mugabe ordered to
investigate graft.
   The ministers and governor are accused of lying to Judge
President Wilson Sandura's commission, which on Thursday published
its report.
   Ndlovu recently was convicted of fraud and given a suspended
jail term of eight months.
   Mugabe said they had erred by overextending themselves
financially on homes, overdrafts and a ``high style of life.''
   ``It was abuse of privilege,'' said Mugabe, an avowed socialist.
``It amounted to conducting a racket in a process of speculation
and profiteering _ the evils of the capitalist system we still have.
   ``When revolutionaries go wrong they must be punished, perhaps
more so because they are revolutionaries,'' said the 65-year-old
leader who promised to transform this country into a socialist
state when it became independent from Britain nine years ago.
   Instead, critics say, most of his politicians have amassed vast
wealth in homes, farms and businesses while the bulk of the 9.2
million people remain largely impoverished.
   Those who resigned earlier are Defense Minister Enos Nkala;
Political Affairs Minister Frederick Shava; and Maurice Nyagumbo,
the most senior of the ministers and a stanch ally of Mugabe.
   Sandura's three-man commission accuses them of abusing their
power to avoid waiting lists lasting up to 10 years to buy cars and
trucks at low fixed prices and sell them on the black market for up
to five times more. Zimbabwe suffers a severe shortage of vehicles
because of a lack of hard currency.
   Police are considering prosecuting 15 senior officials,
including the ministers, for price control violations and perjury.
The black marketeering charges carry fines, and people convicted of
lying to a judge can be jailed for up to five years.

   The United States on Friday urged India and
Nepal to resolve their differences at the negotiating table and not
to endanger stability in the volatile region.
   ``We are urging both countries to begin meaningful talks and to
recognize that a quick and amicable resolution is in their own
interests and that of regional harmony and stability,'' said a
statement issued by the State Department.
   ``We have no comments on the relative merits of this bilateral
issue,'' said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, reading the statement.
   India on Friday accused Nepal of violating a 39-year-old
friendship treaty and said it might have to review its relations
with its tiny, landlocked neighbor.
   Relations between the two countries soured earlier this year
after Nepal bought arms from China, which India views as an enemy.
In the latest development, India stopped trade with Nepal March 19
after the two countries' treaties on trade and transit expired.
   ``What is important is that Nepal and India decide what kind of
relationship these two sovereign and independent countries want
with one another and to make arrangements to facilitate talks in a
way which is least disruptive to those concerned,'' the department
said.

<TEXT>
   A 14-nation commission Friday wrapped
up eight years of work on international disarmament, suggesting
expanded U.N. operations against terrorism, environmental disaster
and civil conflict.
   The Palme Commission, which included former U.S. Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance, Soviet Communist Party Central Committee member
Georgi Arbatov and Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland,
suggested the United Nations establish a peace fund to pay for its
new duties.
   The commission praised disarmament progress since the
organization's founding in 1980 and said international emphasis was
shifting from confrontation to cooperation.
   ``Up to the nuclear age, people thought you have to be strong to
survive. In the best possibility, you could beat your enemy,'' said
Egon Bahr, a member of West Germany's parliament.
   ``This is finished,'' said Bahr. ``We have not completely
succeeded, but we have gone along the way.''
   The independent Vienna-based commission, founded by the late
Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and others, in 1982 proposed the
idea of common security. It was one of the early proponents of a
European zone free of tactical nuclear weapons and a stronger
United Nations.
   It decided two years ago to disband, but to continue disarmament
work in smaller groups.
   A final statement blamed inadequate funding for hampering U.N.
operations in Namibia and threatening peace in the territory, which
gained independence from South Africa on April 1.
   It suggested a special $2 billion reserve fund be set up for
expanded peacekeeping work, paid by mandatory contributions from
all members.
   ``A world that spends the equivalent of nearly $1 trillion each
year to prepare for war should be able to afford the comparatively
small sums required for peacekeeping,'' the document said.
   It suggested U.N. forces be given roles in:
   _ Maritime peacekeeping, in situations such as the dangers to
shipping in the Persian Gulf stemming from the Iran-Iraq war.
   _ Anti-terrorist actions. David Owen, a former British foreign
secretary, said storming a hijacked aircraft or diverting a nuclear
terrorist threat were examples of how such a force could work,
especially in countries too small to have anti-terror units of
their own.
   _ Environmental cleanups in countries that do not have the
expertise to cope with disasters.
   _ Prolonged conflicts within a state, especially when
international relief efforts are threatened.

<TEXT>
   Chinese Premier Li Peng wound up three days of
talks in Japan on Friday, saying China's open-door diplomatic and
economic policy is firmly in place and urging aggressive Japanese
investment in his country.
   Li denied rumors of serious disagreements between him and
Communist Party general secretary Zhao Ziyang about the pace of
economic and political reform in China.
   ``In terms of the general policy of promoting reform and an
`open-door policy,' we agree,'' he said at the Japan National Press
Club. ``The political situation today in China is stable.''
   During his visit, the first to Japan by a Chinese head of
government in seven years, Li met Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita,
Emperor Akihito and other political and business leaders.
   Earlier Friday, Li told businessmen not to let a recent economic
slowdown in China deter them from investing in his country, which
is experiencing severe inflation and cutbacks in public spending.
   Japanese capital and technology would complement China's vast
labor pool, land and natural resources, Li told about 300 business
leaders.
   Japan provides 80 percent of China's credit and is its second
largest trading partner after Hong Kong, but accounts for only 8
percent of total foreign investment there.
   In the diplomatic arena, Li said the Chino-Soviet summit next
month in Beijing will center on normalizing relations between the
two countries and should result in ``positive effects for peace in
China, Asia and the world as a whole.''
   During his meeting with the emperor on Thursday, Li said Akihito
expressed regret for the ``unfortunate history'' between the two
countries. More than 10 million Chinese died during Japan's 1937-45
invasion of the Chinese mainland.
   ``I responded that to recall history is to open up better
prospects for the future,'' Li said.
   China and Japan have been at odds about recent Japanese efforts
to evade responsibility for the war. After criticism by China and
other nations, Takeshita in February retracted a remark that only
future historians can judge whether Japan was an aggressor in the
war.
   During Li's visit, Japan announced it will lend China up to $734
million this fiscal year to help fund 11 projects including
expanding two ports and building a subway in Beijing.
   Li was accompanied by high-ranking government officials
including Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. He is to spend Saturday
sightseeing in western Japan and return Sunday to Beijing.

<HEAD>Chad Says Coup Foiled, Plotters Flee to Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chad reported a failed coup against President
Hissene Habre's government, and Sudan said the leaders, two
generals and the interior minister, escaped to the neighboring
country.
   A government statement releaased Thursday night through Chad's
embassy in France, the former colonial power in the North African
nation, said the plotters ``entered into rebellion against the
institutions of the republic'' on the night of April 1-2.
   It identified them as Hassan Djamous, armed forces commander;
Idriss Debi, his predecessor in the post, and Ibrahim Mahamat Itno,
the interior minister, characterizing all three as ``individuals
motivated and manipulated by overwhelming ambition.''
   The armed forces were ``ordered to destroy'' the plotters and
``put an end to the rebellion by annihilation,'' the statement said.
   When asked what happened to the three men, the Chadian Embassy
in Paris would say only that the plot was discovered and the
authors and their accomplices rendered harmless.
   A statement released Thursday night in Khartoum, capital of
Sudan, said Itno, Djamous and Debi crossed into Darfur province a
week ago. It was issued in the name of Tigani Sysi, governor of the
border province.
   Sudan's military command issued a statement saying Chadian
soldiers had intruded into Darfur and Sudanese soldiers were sent
to expel them. It did not give the number of intruders, but the
magazine Al-Adwaa said 2,000 Chadian soldiers crossed the border.
   Diplomatic sources in N'Djamena, capital of Chad, said April 5
that Itno was arrested and Djamous and Debi had disappeared. They
reported military movements in N'Djamena the weekend of April 1-3
and roadblocks around the city.
   In a report from N'Djamena, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse quoted sources it did not identify as saying Djamous
and Debi were wounded Tuesday in fighting with soldiers who pursued
them into Darfur province. It said Djamous was taken prisoner but
Debi escaped.
   Itno took a leading role in negotiations leading to Habre's
reconciliation with political oppponents who had fought a long
civil war. He also joined negotations that led to a 1987 agreement
with rebel leader Acheik ibn Omar, who was named foreign minister
earlier year.
   Chad became independent of France in 1960. Habre has been
president since 1982, when he ousted a Libyan-backed government led
by Goukouni Oueddei.
   Libya kept military forces in northern Chad and supported
factions opposed to Habre until a successful Chadian military
offensive in 1987.
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, then recognized Habre's
government and agreed to a cease-fire, but there has not been a
permanent settlement.

<HEAD>Editors Blocked From Hearing Castro, Ortega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III defended
on Friday a decision to keep presidents Fidel Castro of Cuba and
Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua from speaking to the American Society of
Newspaper Editors.
   Baker said the government was exercising ``a certain amount of
discretion'' when it informed an invitation commitee that visas
would not be issued for the two Marxist leaders.
   ``I hope it's not the use of censorship,'' Baker said in
response to a question from James Squires, editor of the Chicago
Tribune who had sought clearance for Castro and Ortega to appear
before the convention in Washington.
   Baker said the United States could not have normal relations
with the two nations until U.S. leaders are convinced they observe
basic standards of human rights, have democratic procedures and do
not interfere in the affairs of neighboring countries.
   ``Once you start making exceptions you are on a very slippery
slope,'' he said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, also appearing before the editors,
was asked to explain why Ortega was not allowed to come.
   ``You are not going to learn very much from (Ortega) coming up
here and responding to your questions and making promises,'' Quayle
said. ``What we will learn by, is going down and monitoring in
Nicaragua and seeing if you're going to have an electoral process
established that will allow fair, free elections.''
   ``You have the opportunity, clearly, to ask him questions in
Managua,'' Quayle said. ``But as far as coming up here, I really
don't think that it would be that beneficial.''
   The United States has strained relations with Nicaragua and no
relations with Cuba.
   Squires and other members of the editors group decided not to
invite Castro and Ortega to speak to the convention after they were
told by State Department officials the two leaders would not be
permitted to enter the country.
   After Baker's comments Friday, Margaret Tutwiler, the department
spokeswoman, cited a presidental proclamation and U.S. policy as
grounds ``to deny visas to senior officials of the Cuban
government, given ongoing Cuban support for external subversion and
internal repression.''
   She said she did not know why Ortega would not be eligible for a
U.S. visa.

<TEXT>
   Peasants wielding pitchforks and clubs
chased off a band of Shining Path guerrillas, and violence across
the central highlands claimed six more lives, police said Friday.
   The killings pushed the insurgency death toll this week to 65.
Officials said nearly 800 people have died this year, making 1989
the bloodiest period in Peru's nine-year insurgency.
   Police said Shining Path guerrillas on Thursday killed Mayor
Hipolito Arancibia of Carhuamayo, a town in Junin state 190 miles
north of Ayacucho.
   Arrancibia, 48, was walking from the town council building to
his home nearby when three rebels, two women and a man, shot him to
death and fled, police said.
   Also Thursday, 40 guerrillas in Carhuapata, in Huancavelica
state 33 miles west of Ayacucho, executed the village's treasurer
and his wife after accusing them of mismanaging community funds,
police said.
   The attackers, who were led by a woman, dragged the couple to
the main plaza and forced villagers to witness the shootings,
police said.
   On Wednesday in the nearby hamlet of Paucarbamba, about 200
peasant farmers grabbed farm tools, clubs and knives and confronted
a dozen Shining Path insurgents who had ordered residents to listen
to a guerrilla lecture.
   Police said the rebels ran away and fired a few shots at their
pursuers, killing one man and wounding another.
   Twenty guerrillas leading 80 peasants attacked a police post
Wednesday in Cora Cora, a town in Ayacucho state about 120 miles
south of Ayacucho city, police said.
   Post defenders repelled the attack after five hours of fighting.
Police said two attackers were killed and two wounded.
   The Shining Path has been fighting since 1980 to topple Peru's
elected government and impose a worker-peasant state similar to the
China of Mao-Tse Tung.
   Analysts say the Shining Path draws its major strength from
highland Indian peasants, who see themselves as victims of
discrimination.
   In fighting reported earlier this week, military troops killed
34 Shining Path guerrillas in jungle clashes. Rebels killed 23
peasant farmers, one police officer and a political leader in
attacks throughout the central Andean highlands.

   An angry judge jailed the mayor and the
city attorney of East St. Louis for contempt Friday for failing to
appear at a court hearing on their city's leaking sewer system.
   Mayor Carl Officer and city attorney Eric Vickers were released
on $3,500 bond apiece after spending 1{ hours in the St. Clair
County Jail in Belleville, the county seat.
   Officer called the contempt order by St. Clair County Judge
Sheila O'Brien ``ridiculous.''
   ``What can I say, other than that she has confirmed her
incompetence?'' added Vickers after he was released.
   Earlier, the judge told Vickers she would file a complaint about
his conduct with state agencies in Illinois and Missouri, where
Vickers is licensed to practice law.
   After a bitter courtroom exchange with Vickers, the judge
ordered the city officials jailed for failure to appear at a March
31 hearing. The hearing had been called to discuss sewer problems
in their financially troubled city of 55,000 across the river from
St. Louis, Mo.
   Residents of East St. Louis' Villa Green housing project
complained after raw sewage leaked from a two-acre pond outside the
housing project. The judge ordered the city to drain the pond early
in March.
   Officer told the judge he was absent at the March 31 hearing on
the city's progress because he was ``suffering from the effects of
the flu.'' But he answered, ``I don't know,'' when asked where he
was over the next two days following the hearing.
   O'Brien then sentenced the two officials to six months in jail
for contempt.
   ``This is the most bizarre and outrageous situation I have ever
seen in a court of law,'' Vickers told O'Brien. ``It is obvious
this court has no sense of fairness and decency.''
   The judge responded sharply.
   ``Don't fight with me, Mr. Vickers,'' she said. ``You're picking
a fight you will not win.''
   Court bailiffs handcuffed Officer and Vickers together and led
them from the courtroom. As they walked out, the men lifted their
hands in a salute.
   Earlier, venting her anger over what she called East St. Louis'
``callous disregard'' for the court's orders, Ms. O'Brien
reinstated an order of March 3 that the city post a $500,000 bond
to guarantee its sewers be fixed in 90 days.
   The order also requires the city to pay the costs of the lawyers
who took the sewage system complaints to court.
   At the March 31 hearing, East St. Louis Public Works Director
Jesse Walker told O'Brien his employees were pumping sewage around
the clock to keep it from backing into the Villa Griffin pond, but
a shortage of machines and manpower was hindering progress.
   An that time, Sheila Shunick, a lawyer for tenants at the Villa
Griffin housing project, requested that the city show cause why it
should not be held in contempt and O'Brien granted her request.
   The judge has been holding hearings at two-week intervals on the
city's progress in stemming the free flow of sewage from leaking or
blocked pipes. The next hearing is set for June 9.
   Shunick acknowledged Friday that the city had made some progress
in repairing the sewers. Officer told the judge the city has spent
$15 million since 1979 on its the sewer system.

   To most of her classmates, Sara
Aldrete was a cheery, well-groomed honor student. But some said the
woman accused of being part of a murderous, drug-smuggling cult had
exhibited some bizarre behavior.
   Ms. Aldrete, a resident alien, was believed to be on the run in
the United States. She may be alone or with cult leader Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo, a 26-year-old Cuban who headed the drug-smuggling
operation and committed many of the acts, according to suspects in
custody for the slayings.
   By most accounts, Ms. Aldrete was a respected student at Texas
Southmost College who dreamed of getting a degree in physical
education. But one student told the Brownsville Herald she
sometimes wore necklaces which she told people not to touch because
something bad might happen to them.
   ``She would wear these metal medallions and she wouldn't let
anybody touch them,'' the unidentified student said. As he spoke,
other students nodded their heads in agreement but they all refused
to give their names, the Herald reported Friday.
   Police say that in Mexico she also was known as ``the witch,''
one of about 10 members of a cult that kidnapped, tortured and
killed at least 13 people for revenge or in rituals aimed at
protecting the group's members from harm.
   ``She had one life in Matamoros, with what she was doing with
these people in narcotics and worshiping,'' said Cameron County
Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito. ``And in the United States, she was a
student at TSC, and all the sports she was involved in, activities,
and was on the honor roll.''
   ``The friends over here didn't know much about what she was
doing in Mexico,'' Gavito said.
   Even her parents in Matamoros knew nothing of the activities of
their daughter, who was president of the TSC soccer Booster Club
and won the school's Outstanding Physical Education Award last year.
   Israel and Maria Teresa Villareal last saw their daughter when
she left the house a week ago. Earlier this week, police raided the
daughter's upstairs room and found an altar with candles, blood
splattered on the wall and a burnt floor.
   ``We were ignorant of this,'' the parents told the Houston
Chronicle.
   One of the cult's victims was Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old
University of Texas pre-med student whose disappeared from
Matamoros during spring break. Kilroy was among those kidnapped,
killed and mutilated by the cult at the Santa Elena Ranch, about 20
miles west of Matamoros.
   Ms. Aldrete, who often drove a 1988 model car equipped with a
cellular telephone, had received $855 in financial aid to attend
the community college this semester. She was in a work-study
program, attending classes and also earning $3.35 an hour, school
records show.
   Ms. Aldrete's teachers also were stunned by the allegations
against her.
   ``This whole thing is unbelieveable. If anybody would have
picked up on some of those occult characteristics in class I think
it would have been me,'' said Tony Zavaleta, an anthropology
professor who also specializes in folk medicine research and taught
Ms. Aldrete in several classes.
   ``She was striking _ always well-groomed, neatly dressed, always
present in class. She was the perfect student. If I had a room full
of students like her, I'd be happy,'' Zavaleta said.
   Police were not sure how Ms. Aldrete became involved with the
cult and drug-smuggling group.
   ``We know she is a major player and we are trying to find her,''
said Oran Neck, agent-in-charge of the U.S. Customs Service in
Brownsville.
   Mexican and U.S. authorities also were trying to piece together
how others in the cult were recruited, and Zavaleta said it may
lead back to Ms. Aldrete, whose striking features may have been
used to lure other members into the flock.
   Mexican police say cult members took some orders from Ms.
Aldrete.
   ``I just really will not believe all this until I hear it from
Sara's own lips,'' said Marvine Wallace, a TSC physical education
teacher.

<HEAD>Vietnam Asks Britain To Co-Chair Withdrawal Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam has asked Britain to be
co-chairman of an international commission to monitor the
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, a British official
said Friday.
   Lord Glenarthur, minister for foreign and commonwealth affairs,
said the request was made during his visit to Hanoi on April 9-14.
   Glenarthur, the first British minister to visit Vietnam since
the communists won the war in April 1975, said he told Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach his government would study the request.
   He added, however, that he felt the United Nations should head
the commission. U.N. peacekeepers usually are used to monitor
cease-fires and troop withdrawals.
   ``There are pitfalls in our taking part,'' he said without
elaboration at a news conference in Bangkok.
   Vietnam has occupied Cambodia since an invasion in December 1978.
   On April 5, the Vietnamese said they would withdraw by Sept. 30
and welcomed international monitoring.
   Hanoi recommended revival of a commission establioshed in 1954
Geneva agreements to supervise the pullout of French and communist
Vietnamese forces from Cambodia. Britain was co-chairman of the
commission.

   Travelers rerouted their flights through Illinois
and Europeans asked how to play as state lottery officials Friday
raised the Lotto jackpot to $62 million, the largest in U.S.
history.
   State lottery spokeswoman Marlen Roth said ``they're coming in
by land and sea'' to buy tickets for Saturday's drawing, which
surpassed the previous record of $61 million set last October in
California.
   ``I had a phone call yesterday from somebody who said,
``Avez-vous lottery at O'Hare?' and I said `Oui,''' Ms. Roth said.
   ``I speak some French and knew that he was calling from Paris,''
she said. ``From what I could gather from the conversation, he had
been at O'Hare (International Airport in Chicago) and did not buy a
ticket. Somebody on the plane was telling him about the lottery, so
now he wanted to know what to do.
   ``From what I gather he was going to plan another trip'' to
Illinois to buy a ticket, Ms. Roth said.
   An Italian man from Venice who said he had relatives in Illinois
called Friday, before the jackpot was raised from $55 million to
$62 million.
   ``He kept saying `Cinquanta-cinque, cinquanta-cinque,''' which
means ``55'' in Italian, Ms. Roth said. ``He kept saying that the
$55 million was his ... `Mio, mio, mio.'''
   When he learned the tickets can't be mailed outside Illinois,
``he assured me he would track his relatives down, no matter how''
and ask them to buy him one, she said.
   Gov. James R. Thompson bought nine tickets in Chicago.
   ``Never mind this governor's job. I'm going to win the money,''
Thompson said. Spokesman Barry Hickman later made clear that
winning would not lead the governor to resign.
   Calls from other states flooded lottery officials' phones.
   ``Some of them say they're planning on driving to Illinois. Some
are saying they're rerouting their flights to go through O'Hare,''
said spokeswoman Kathy Rem at the Springfield lottery office.
   Gambling travelers lined up at O'Hare, where sales for
Saturday's drawing have been just about double the average, said
Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, which runs the
airport's six Lotto kiosks.
   ``Who knows when the wheel of fortune spins or not,'' said
Arthur Beane, a salesman from South Carolina.
   Larry Eyestone of Urbana won a $1.4 million Illinois Lotto
jackpot in 1983, but had hopes of scoring another win. ``I figure
lightning can strike again,'' he said.
   Ms. Rem said the jackpot, which guarantees a single winner 20
annual payments of $3.1 million, could be raised higher by soaring
sales and an expected surge of last-minute players.
   Lottery Director Sharon Sharp determines when money from sales
is added to the pot, and normally checks sales figures once a day.
   This week, she's been checking them once an hour, Ms. Rem said,
adding that about $1 million worth of tickets was being sold hourly
Friday.
   Vendors raked in $9.9 million in sales Thursday, which broke the
previous record for the day, $6.1 million, set in August 1984 when
the jackpot was $40 million _ the previous state record, Ms. Rem
said.
   By late Thursday, a total of about $25.1 million tickets had
been sold for the drawing, 54 percent more than were sold in the
week before the 1984 drawing, she said.
   ``It's pretty wild,'' said Rae Ann Schoenbacher, assistant
manager at Midway Liquors in Springfield.
   ``Last night we did $4,000 in Lotto,'' she said. ``A guy came in
the day before yesterday and bought $650 in quick picks.''
   The jackpot for the Saturday Lotto drawing usually is about $5
million _ but the last winner was March 18, and unclaimed prizes
are rolled over to the next week. Additional money from ticket
sales is added to the pot.
   Each $1 ticket has two plays. In each bet, the bettor _ or the
computer _ picks six numbers between 1 and 54. The odds of winning
the Lotto on a two-play ticket are 12.9 million to one.
   As the lottery spokeswoman told the man from Paris, ``Bonne
chance.''

<HEAD>China, With 1.1 Billion People, Says Population Growth Out Of Control</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's population has reached 1.1 billion, and
officials said Friday that the nation's population growth is out of
control despite a government policy allowing only one child per
family.
   Chinese leaders, in meetings publicizing the new figure, said
China will have difficulty feeding and housing itself if population
growth is not checked.
   The People's Daily said in an editorial that the large
population ``has become the main obstacle to the development of the
economy.''
   China reached the 1.1 billion figure a little more than seven
years after becoming the world's first nation with 1 billion people.
   The government had wanted to limit the population to 1.2 billion
in the year 2000, but officials and experts now acknowledge the
goal is impossible.
   Estimates for the number of Chinese at the turn of the century
have jumped to 1.3 billion, which would be about 20 percent of the
total world population.
   China Daily quoted Vice Premier Tian Jiyun as saying 20 million
more Chinese would be born every year over the next decade if
recent birth rates remain unchanged.
   In 1988, China recorded 23 million births and 7 million deaths
as a baby boom generation from the 1960s entered its child-bearing
years and defiance of state birth control policies spread.
   China in 1980 adopted a policy calling for late marriages and
one child per family. Couples giving birth to more than one child
are fined or lose various social benefits.
   It is estimated that China's population would have grown by an
additional 100 million during the past decade without the state
policy. The nationwide population growth was held to only 11 per
1,000 in 1985, a figure well below those of most developing
countries.
   However, the growth rate rose to 14 out of 1,000 in 1986 and 16
out of 1,000 in 1987 because of the second wave of the baby boom
and the unpopularity of the one-child policy in rural areas.
   The return of family farming has made farmers rich enough to pay
fines for having extra children and has increased the need for
children, particularly boys, to help cultivate the land.
   According to one recent survey, since 1980 about 9 million
babies a year have been born outside the state plan, and less than
60 percent of women of child-bearing age practice birth control.
   Tian noted the recent relaxation of the one-child policy in the
countryside, saying families who experience difficulties, including
those families with one daughter, may have a second child after an
interval of several years.
   He said that ``under no circumstances'' should a couple have
three or more children.

   President Bush and congressional leaders
Friday announced a showpiece budget compromise to reduce the 1990
federal deficit to under $100 billion without raising taxes.
   But the pact puts off most hard decisions and Democratic leaders
suggested it could open the way to tax increases next year.
   Bush, flanked by top lawmakers at a White House ceremony,
boasted they had accomplished ``the first such agreement reached
ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of a crisis.'' He
called it a ``first manageable step'' in the deficit-fighting
journey.
   The plan would enable Bush to say he is holding to his ``no new
taxes'' campaign pledge, while trimming the budget deficit to $99.4
billion, just within the $100 billion target set by the
Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.
   Under the agreement, Bush would be forced to accept lower
defense spending and more spending for domestic programs than he
initially sought. In exchange, congressional leaders pledged to
abide by Bush's anti-tax stance _ at least for one year.
   But even as the accord _ hammered out the night before between
administration and congressional negotiators _ was announced with
great fanfare, key participants conceded that it was only a
skeleton that fell short of spelling out where specific programs
should be cut to accomplish the savings it trumpeted.
   ``No one should be deluded into thinking that this is the end of
a process,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
``It is the beginning of a process. Very hard choices lie ahead.''
   And another leading Democrat, Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, boycotted the Rose Garden session entirely,
although he joined other congressional leaders in attending a
preceding White House session with Bush to go over the compromise.
   ``He declined to go out into the Rose Garden and have his
picture taken because he doesn't like the agreement,'' said Bentsen
spokesman Jack Devore.
   The Texas Democrat told Bush ``that he's concerned that it
depends on wildly optimistic economic assumptions and there remains
a great gulf between the Congress and the administration on how you
raise the $5.3 billion in new taxes Bush is calling for,'' the
spokesman said.
   Still, Bush, his top lieutenants and most congressional leaders
were upbeat.
   ``It is a major step toward a balanced budget,'' said House
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
   Major elements of the agreement include:
   _ Total deficit reductions of about $28 billion for the fiscal
year that begins next Oct. 1. The projected 1990 deficit of $99.4
billion comparesto a 1989 deficit estimated by the administration
at $163.3 billion.
   _ Defense outlays of $299.2 billion, down from $300.6 billion
proposed by Bush in his Feb. 9 budget message to Congress.
   _ A level of discretionary domestic spending of $181.3 billion,
up from the $175.9 billion proposed by Bush, and spending in social
programs in which benefits to individuals are mandated by law of
$556.4 billion, up from Bush's proposal for $531.4 billion.
   _ A decision to adhere, without specifying in what manner, to
Bush's call for $5.3 billion in new tax revenue without enacting
what the president considers a tax increase.
   Lawmakers said that new-revenues measure could prove to be the
most thorny to negotiate.
   In Bush's budget, much of this would come from additional
revenues he expects to be gained from business growth spurred by a
reduction in the tax on capital gains
   ``In my view, the capital gains tax, which was advanced by the
administration, has two chances of passage by this Congress: slim
and none,'' Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn,
told a later news briefing.
   But Budget Director Richard Darman retorted: ``I think if you
had asked several people here what the chances would have been that
we would be here in agreement on a budget resolution before April
15th in the first year of the Bush presidency, the answers would
have been `slim and none.'''
   The budget agreement deliberately puts off most decisions on
specific spending increases and cuts _ for instance, nowhere does
it suggest where the money would come from to pay for Bush's
proposals to increase spending for educational programs, for the
homeless and for more environmental protection.
   ``This is not an heroic agreement,'' said House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas. ``If we begin with the assumption that there can
be no significant major increase in revenue, this agreement is
about as good as we could do.''
   ``It cannot be emphasized enough that this is a first step, no
more and no less,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif.
   Asked whether the no-new-taxes agreement was only a one-year
pledge, Panetta said that beginning with the fiscal 1991 budget,
``I think everything has to be on the table _ taxes, entitlements
and defense.''
   Sasser agreed, saying: ``Next time, we're going to have to start
looking for some revenues.''
   Bush said, ``The budget agreement does not complete the whole
deficit-reduction job ... but I am convinced that we will only be
able to complete that job if we tackle it in manageable steps on an
orderly basis in a constructive bipartisan spirit.''

   Thousands of Chaldean Catholics paid last
respects Friday to patriarch Mar Paul II Cheikho.
   Church officials said Mar Paul, 83, died Thursday while
conducting a service in the Mother of Sorrows, where his body lay
in state before burial beside his predecessors in the 400-year-old
church, Baghdad's oldest.
   In stifling hot weather, the Chaldean faithful filed past the
black-draped open coffin, many stooping to kiss the dead
patriarch's hand. Others bowed and made the sign of the cross.
   Mar Paul was spiritual leader of the Chaldean Catholics for 30
years.
   The Uniate Chaldean Church, affiliated with Rome but
semi-autonomous, has about 300,000 adherents and 18 archbishoprics
in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and the United States. About
half Iraq's Christians are Chaldeans.
   Chaldean archbishops elect their primate and a synod is expected
within 40 days to choose a new Patriarch of Babylon of the
Chaldeans, the full title.

   Soviet Georgia's Communist Party chief and premier
were removed Friday, five days after they ordered troops to
disperse a crowd of protesters in a bloody melee that killed 19
people. The KGB chief was named party leader.
   ``Nobody and nothing can justify the deaths of absolutely
innocent people,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, himself
an ethnic Georgian, said in a speech to the local party plenum that
made the leadership changes.
   He said in remarks later broadcast on Soviet television that it
was impossible to tolerate blunders by officials that led to
``death and loss.''
   Shevardnadze, party chief in the southern republic from 1972 to
1985 and a member of the ruling Politburo in Moscow, was dispatched
to his homeland after Sunday's bloodshed.
   The resignation of Communist Party First Secretary Dzhumber I.
Patiashvili, who had accepted responsibility for the tragedy, was
unanimously accepted by the party's Central Committee after
``heated discussion,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov told a news briefing in Moscow.
   Givi G. Gumbaridze, who has been Georgia's KGB chief for two
months, was elected to replace Patiashvili. Gumbaridze, 45,
previously served as party leader in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital
city of 1.2 million people.
   Premier Zurab Chkheidze also was removed at a separate meeting
of Georgia's Presidium, or top government body, the official Tass
news agency reported. Nodari Chitanava, a Central Committee
secretary, was named the new head of the republic's government,
Tass said.
   Georgia's president, Otari Cherkeziya, also offered to resign,
and the matter will be considered at the next session of Georgia's
Supreme Soviet parliament, which is empowered to remove him, Tass
said.
   Tass quoted Shevardnadze as telling the meeting that lessons
from the incident were ``difficult and bitter,'' adding that the
events were ``detrimental'' to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reform policies.
   Gerasimov gave no reason for the Georgia shake-up but said
earlier that leaders in Georgia accepted responsibility for
directing troops to clear a square of pro-independence
demonstrators in Tbilisi on Sunday. At least 19 people were killed
by official count.
   The republic's Communist Party newspaper Zarya Vostoka said
local party leaders couldn't escape responsibility ``when a
political decision taken by the leadership was carried out,
unfortunately, in such a way that it led to heavy moral, ethical
and human losses.''
   Signs posted at Tbilisi State University after the clash outside
local government headquarters called Patiashvili a ``killer.'' The
49-year-old Georgian was elected first secretary in July 1985,
succeeding Shevardnadze.
   In shaking up their leadership, Georgian party officials were
following a pattern set last year in the neighboring republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan. After four months of nationalist protests
there, the Armenian and Azerbaijani party chiefs were fired,
apparently for their inability to halt unrest.
   Tass described the situation in Georgia as stable Friday, with
all enterprises in the capital working ``at full blast.''
   However, the deputy director of Georgia's official Gruzinform
news agency, Zhorab Lomidze, said some businesses were not
operating at normal levels because of a strike that began a week
ago in Tbilisi, 900 miles south of Moscow. And the Georgian party's
Politburo described the situation as ``strained,'' with
universities and schools still closed by boycotts.
   Leda Archvadze, sister-in-law of arrested Georgian human rights
activist Zviad Gamsakhurdia, said that outside Government House,
the site of the confrontation, a memorial has appeared
spontaneously.
   ``There are mountains of flowers. Every day people place fresh
flowers,'' she said by telephone.
   An estimated 2,000 people marched through the streets Thursday
for the first funeral for one of the victims, psychiatrist Zia
Djinjaradze, according to a Tbilisi human rights activist. More
funerals were planned for Saturday and Sunday, said Lomidze and Ms.
Archvadze.
   A commission is investigating whether soldiers who broke up the
protest had short metal shovels customarily used for digging
trenches, Gerasimov said Thursday. He said the troops were not
supposed to be carrying the shovels, and that they could be
punished if the commission finds they used them to beat protesters.
   Patiashvili has said he did not expect fatalities when troops
were ordered out because they were equipped only with nightsticks
and shields. But several Georgians who spoke in telephone
interviews said the soldiers also had shovels.
   In his televised remarks, Shevardnadze said it was Georgians'
``supreme duty to establish the truth'' about how their countrymen
died.
   In broadcast remarks blaming local officials as well as protest
organizers for the weekend fracas, he said:
   ``One should not remain indifferent to any threats from
irresponsible people, who too freely interpret the notions of
democratization and openness, or people who occupy important posts,
but are not capable of giving up false principles of the past, to
any miscalculations and mistakes in implementing this policy _
especially when it is connected to death and loss.''

   The government should get involved in
investigating suspected scientific fraud by university researchers
only after institutional procedures have been exhausted, the head
of an association representing 56 major U.S. research universities
said Friday.
   ``To hold open the threat of an office of government that can
march in at any time and take over an ongoing investigation is both
unnecessary and harmful,'' said Robert M. Rozensweig, president of
the Washington-based Association of American Universities.
   He said that as with government regulations on testing of human
subjects and animal research, ``the government can help to
encourage and buttress institutional responsibility.''
   ``It is essential that there be clear statements that reinforce
the primacy of the institution's role, and that there be equally
clear statements specifying the conditions under which the
government's authority will be invoked.
   ``In general, that ought to be only after the institution has
completed its work, or if the institutional processes are found to
be defective, or if the institution itself asks for help,''
Rozensweig told a conference sponsored by the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
   Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, is planning to introduce legislation that would
set up a special federal office to oversee the integrity of
research activities.
   In addition, an Institute of Medicine panel recently proposed a
series of recommendations to the National Institutes of Health to
help deal with the problem of fraud and misconduct in biomedical
research.
   Paul J. Friedman, a member of the medical panel, told the
conference that the group urged ``lessening of the competitive
pressures that encourage abuses of good research and authorship
practices.''
   ``Institutions were asked to give serious consideration to
proposals to limit the number of publications reviewed for
advancement; instead of stressing productivity, institutions would
really concentrate on determining the quality of a small number of
papers,'' he said.
   Friedman, associate dean of the School of Medicine of the
University of California at San Diego, said the panel recommended
that by 1992 institutions receiving federal research funds be
required to develop ``appropriate scientific and ethical
standards.''
   He noted there have been proposals by congressional committees
and the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human
Services to conduct data audits on randomly selected scientific
research experiments.
   But Friedman said the Institute of Medicine panel ``came out
squarely against this idea, regarding it as not likely to catch any
determined cheaters, but very likely to lead to interminable
arguments about the selection and interpretation of research data.''
   ``It would inevitably be extremely costly in professional time
and would pit a new investigative bureaucracy against the
scientific community,'' he said.

   The operating rate at the nation's factories,
mines and utilities declined in March for the second consecutive
month, the government said Friday in a report read as a sign that
inflationary pressures are easing.
   The Federal Reserve Board said U.S. industry used 84 percent of
its capacity last month, down from 84.2 percent in February and
84.4 percent in January.
   It was the first back-to-back decline in the operating rate
since August-September 1986.
   ``I think this is unambiguous confirmation that the economy is
slowing due to high interest rates, a slowdown in trade improvement
and some tapering off of the capital (investment) boom,'' said
economist Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of
Manufacturers.
   The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear
they will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,
leading to shortages and price increases. Economists consider an
operating rate of 85 percent as a clear sign that inflation will
accelerate.
   This report ``will help to alleviate the inflationary pressures
that come from bottlenecks and shortages and excess demand. It will
certainly take some pressure off,'' said economist Cynthia Latta of
Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   Stock and bond prices rose sharply in early trading after the
release of the report and another by the Labor Department which
said wholesale prices in March had risen at a moderate 0.4 percent
rate.
   In a related report indicating sluggishness, the Federal Reserve
said the pace of industrial production was flat for the second
month in a row in March, leaving its industrial production index at
141 percent of its 1977 base, 4.6 percent higher than a year ago.
   Jasinowski said that although the central bank's reports showed
the economy slowing, they did not yet presage a recession.
   Production dipped 0.1 percent at manufacturing plants after an
identical rise a month earlier. Output at mines and oil wells rose
0.5 percent after a sharp 1.5 percent decline a month earlier.
Production at utilities dropped 0.5 percent after a large 2.3
percent jump in February.
   The output of automobiles and light trucks fell in March to an
annual rate of 7.1 million units, down from 7.2 million a month
earlier. However, output of business equipment and construction
supplies rose.
   The operating rate at manufacturing plants dipped to 84.4
percent last month, from 84.7 percent in February and 84.9 percent
in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods, ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years, fell to 83 percent,
from 83.3 percent, reflecting declines in fabricated metal products
and automobiles and parts. It was the third consecutive decline at
auto plants, to 82.4 percent in March. The auto industry has been
hit with slow sales this year.
   At plants manufacturing non-durable goods, the rate slipped from
86.6 percent to 86.3 percent last month.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate rose from 81.2 percent to 81.6 percent. At
utilities, the rate fell from 82.3 percent to 81.8 percent.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Jailed Terrorists Have Abandoned Hunger Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two jailed terrorists ended a
72-day hunger strike Friday after refusing a compromise offered by
state authorities, said a lawyer for the inmates.
   Several hours earlier, supporters of the hunger strikers
firebombed two banks in West Berlin and smashed windows at a car
dealership in Hamburg.
   Damage was minor in the predawn attacks, and there were no
injuries, police said.
   Sympathizers of the inmates, members of the leftist Red Army
Faction, have carried out at least six such attacks in the past
three days.
   Attorney Johannes Pausch said Christa Eckes and Karl-Heinz
Dellwo announced they were ending their hunger strike after they
turned down a government offer to be housed in small groups with
other imprisoned members of the terrorist group.
   Ms. Eckes and Dellwo had refused all but water and vitamins
since Feb. 1 in demand of a special cell block for all 28 convicted
Red Army Faction terrorists.
   Authorities have declined to provide specific information about
the condition of the two.
   At least 30 other inmates were taking part in the hunger strike,
but only Ms. Eckes and Dellwo had refused food continuously.
   It was not immediately known whether the other hunger strikers
would continue their action.
   In a statement released by Pausch, Ms. Eckes and Dellwo said
they were ending their strike to ``remove the tensions for a time.''
   The statement indicated the prisoners would resume the strike if
they saw no signs that officials would seriously consider their
demands.
   At the prison in Celle where 37-year-old Dellwo is serving a
life sentence for murder and kidnapping, an emergency medical team
had been standing by to render aid, said Hartmut Moellring,
spokesman for the Lower Saxony state justice ministry.
   Moellring said Dellwo was weak but still able to walk at times.
He said Dellwo had refused to be weighed or treated by doctors.
   The Red Army Faction has been responsible for carrying out
assassinations and bomb attacks on West German businesses and on
government and NATO military targets since the early 1970s.
   Dellwo took part in a 1975 attack on the West German embassy in
Stockholm in which two embassy employees were killed. He was
convicted in 1977 and sentenced to two life terms.
   Ms. Eckes, 39, was convicted in 1986 of belonging to a terrorist
organization, forgery and illegal possession of weapons. She was
sentenced to eight years in prison and is being held at the
Froendenberg prison hospital near Dortmund.
   A spokeswoman for a hunger-strike monitoring office set up in
Hamburg said Ms. Eckes was ``in reasonably good condition
considering the circumstances. But she was placed in the prison
hospital against her will.''
   The spokeswoman declined to be identifed by name.

<HEAD>Pravda Says New Political Party Wants Communists Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda accused the
new political group Democratic Union on Friday of seeking to remove
the Communist Party from power and change the Soviet Union's social
system.
   It said there should be a law against such activities.
   Pravda said it was natural that in the process of perestroika,
or restructuring, such organizations would emerge. ``What is needed
is legislative protection for perestroika and glasnost (greater
openness),'' it said. ``Society should be guaranteed protection
against extremism.''
   It said organizations like the Democratic Union, which was
formed last May, can only harm the perestroika drive.
   Yuri Mityunov, a spokesman for the Democratic Union, called
Pravda's allegations ridiculous.
   ``Ours is a very ordinary program,'' Mityunov said in a
telephone interview. ``We want pluralism, equal opportunities for
all.''
   He said that if the Communist Party had a better program to
offer when voting time came, ``we will vote for the Communist
Party.''
   The Democratic Union says it wants elections with competing
parties, independent trade unions, a new constitution and
withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Europe and areas taken by the
Soviet Union in World War II.
   The group has affiliates throughout the country, but no
membership count was available.
   Pravda said an analysis of Democratic Union documents circulated
in Leningrad showed the organization lifted more than two-thirds of
its program straight from the Communist Party itself on human
rights, political and economic reform, questions of education and
culture, and relations with the church.
   ``All this, however, is nothing more than camouflage,'' it said.
``The true aim of the Democratic Union, as follows from its
documents, is to remove the Soviet Communist Party from the
political scene, and change the social system.''
   The newspaper said that when new laws are drafted on the status
of public organizations, they should incorporate the right to take
legislative steps to ban the activities of extremist organizations
like the Democratic Union.
   The Pravda article said Leningrad leaders of the Democratic
Union, which claims about 2,000 members, were of dubious character.
It said one leader once served prison time for burglary and a
second was convicted of extortion, swindling and currency
violations.
   Mityunov said, ``The Pravda article is very weak; there are no
facts to substantiate its allegations.''

<TEXT>
   The secretary-general of Japan's governing party
acknowledged Friday that his wife was paid about $60,000 in
consulting fees from Recruit Co., the firm at the center of a
bribery scandal shaking the government.
   Shintaro Abe also told a news conference: ``I put my secretary
entirely in charge of my fund-raising affairs, and neither my wife
nor myself knew anything about it. But I have found such a deal
took place and I admit it was a result of my ignorance.''
   He confirmed news reports that Recruit Co., a publishing
conglomerate, paid his wife Yoko about $2,300 monthly as a
consulting fee from February 1986 to August 1988. He said the money
was deposited into a bank account of his secretary, who has been
sick and hospitalized.
   Abe, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party, is
considered Japan's most powerful poltician after Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita.
   Abe was foreign minister at the time the consulting fee was paid
by Recruit.
   On Tuesday, Takeshita told Parliament that from 1985 to 1987 his
political support groups had received $1 million from Recruit and
its subsidiaries, with the money coming in the form of donations
and purchases of party fund-raising tickets.
   Takeshita was at that time the Liberal Democrats'
secretary-general.
   About 17 politicians and 150 other influential people are known
to have bought at discount prices hundreds of thousands of unlisted
shares in a subsidiary of Recruit and then received substantial
profits when the share price soared after trading began. Takeshita
has denied any personal involvement. Such stock transactions are
not considered illegal.
   But opposition leaders say Recuit also paid millions to
influential people as political contributions and expected favors
in return.
   Fourteen people, including two former vice ministers and an
ex-chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. have been
arrested on charges of bribery and securities law violations in
connection with the affair. Former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
and and two other Cabinet members resigned after being linked to
the scandal.
   Abe's disclosures Friday contradicted a declaration by the
Liberal Democratic Party earlier this year that no members of the
current Takeshita administration received donations from Recruit
after last summer.
   Opposition parties increased their criticism.
   ``How can he (Abe) not know about the deposits?'' said Yukihisa
Yoshida of the Democratic Socialist Party. ``It is extremely
serious that he was receiving money even after the Recruit scandal
surfaced.''
   Shun Ohide, a leader of the Socialist Party, Japan's largest
opposition group, said: ``Abe has been reported to be closely
linked to Recruit, and I think it (Friday's revelation) was only
part of it. After all these revelations, the Liberal Democratic
Party should resign.''
   Takeshita has refused calls for his resignation, vowing to carry
out political reforms and restore public trust in his
administration.

<HEAD>Mozmbique Says Rebels Receive Aid from Inside South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mozambique's premier said Friday the
rebels fighting his Marxist government receive aid from within
South Africa, but did not accuse the South African government of
providing it.
   Mario de Graca Machungo said the Mozambique National Resistance,
known by the acronym Renamo, has killed more than 100,000 people
and caused $6 billion in damage.
   ``We know that most of their aid comes from inside South
Africa,'' he said. ``We are not sure whether South Africa serves as
a source or a transit point.''
   South Africa and Mozambique agreed in 1984 not to support rebels
fighting each other's governments. Mozambique closed African
National Congress bases on its territory and South Africa pledged
to stop supporting Renamo.
   Government officials and private agencies held a pledging
conference Friday with a goal of $382 million in money and goods
for Mozambique's emergency needs in 1989-90. U.N. spokesman Salim
Lone reported more than $350 million in pledges.
   A report prepared by the United Nations and Mozambique asked for
more than $237 million in emergency food aid as the most pressing
requirement.
   In Maputo, capital of Mozambique, the official news agency AIM
said two Renamo guerrillas who surrendered said the rebels received
weapons from South Africa last year. One was quoted as saying South
African planes delivered arms to central Mozambique.
   The AIM report did not say whether the planes and supplies were
from the South African military or private sources. It identified
the former guerrillas as Diogo Toni and Wiriam Erton.

   A judge blocked prosecutors Friday from
presenting key testimony in the trial of a Christian Science couple
charged with murder for allowing their young daughter to die of
diabetes without treatment.
   Former banker William Hermanson, 42, and his wife Christine, 38,
are charged with third-degree murder and felony child abuse in the
Sept. 30, 1986, death of 7-year-old Amy. The couple sought the aid
of spiritual healers but not doctors.
   Defense attorneys successfully blocked the testimony of a family
friend who said out of the jury's presence that Amy's parents
obtained medical care for themselves but didn't get Amy the insulin
injections that could have saved her.
   Attorney Charles Arnold said the surprise testimony Thursday
violated state rules of discovery requiring lawyers to notify the
other side of damaging testimony expected to be introduced.
   The state acknowledged its inaction but gave no explanation, and
Circuit Judge Stephen Dakan ruled that the testimony was
inadmissible. Dakan dismissed the six-member jury until Monday when
the defense will present its case.
   The judge reserved a ruling on a defense motion for an acquittal
on grounds that the state had failed to prove anything other than
that the couple were practicing their religion.
   Christian Science doctrine relies on prayer and spiritual
practioners rather than medicine to heal illness. There are no
sanctions, however, for followers who seek medical aid.
   At issue, the defense maintained, is religious freedom.
   The Hermansons' defense rests on a 1975 Florida law that
protects parents who withhold medical treatment from their sick
children if the parents are ``legitimately practicing'' their
religious beliefs.
   Assistant State Attorney Deno Economou, however, insisted the
Hermansons knowingly let their daughter die.
   In the disputed testimony, family friend Mary Christman said she
visited the Hermansons three days after Amy's death and learned
Hermanson once had taken Novocain for a tooth problem.
   His wife suggested she had anesthesia during childbirth, Mrs.
Christman testified.
   ``I said, `God, Chris, if Bill had Novocain and you had two
Caesarean sections .. how could you have done that without any
anesthetic?''' Mrs. Christman told the judge and attorneys.
   Mrs. Hermanson replied, ``Well, that was a different
situation,'' the friend said.
   Mrs. Hermanson also contended Amy's body would have rejected
insulin because her husband's body rejected Novocain, Mrs.
Christman testified.

   Suspected Basque separatists on Friday
detonated a bomb as a civil guard patrol car passed by, and two
guards were injured, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the blast in the town near
San Sebastian, about 200 miles northeast of Madrid near the French
border. Police blamed it on the separatist group ETA, an acronym
for Basque Land and Liberty in the Basque language.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mostly police and military officers, since 1968 when it began its
campaign to gain independence for the three Basque provinces in

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A jury ruled Friday that a
25-year-old man was insane when he shot four people to death in
their cars and wounded five others while sheriff's deputies watched
and waited for orders from superiors.
   Michael Charles Hayes, 25, a former moped shop operator from
Davidson County, was found innocent on four counts of first-degree
murder and eight counts of assault in the July 17 shooting rampage.
   The verdict from the Forsyth County jury was announced after 14
hours of deliberations over four days.
   Superior Court Judge James Beaty ordered that Hayes be taken
into custody and brought to the John Umstead Hospital in Butner,
where he will undergo psychiatric treatment before a hearing.
   ``The court finds reasonable grounds that Michael Charles Hayes
would probably be dangerous to himself and to others,'' Beaty said
before sending him to the hospital. ``There's a substantial risk
that he would commit bodily harm to others.''
   Hayes put his hand on his forehead and cried when the verdict
was read in the half-filled courtroom. Family members of victims
and some of the survivors also sobbed. Others reacted with anger.
   ``There wasn't one crazy person in there. There were 13, and you
know who the other 12 are,'' said Gary Hull, brother of Ron Hull,
who was killed in the shooting spree.
   Nick Nicholson, father of one of the dead, Thomas Nicholson,
said the families of the victims were shocked by the verdict. ``I
have no idea why they went the way they did,'' he said.
   After the shooting spree, county sheriff's deputies were
criticized for waiting for permission to shoot Hayes as he
brandished a .22-caliber rifle, ranting and flagging down cars.
Dispatchers were criticized for telling deputies to ``stand by.''
   All the victims, people making their way home on a well-traveled
road at the end of the day, were shot at close range before
deputies finally wounded Hayes in a hail of gunfire.
   On the day before the rampage, Hayes' family had tried to have
him committed to a mental hospital.
   ``This is the only verdict that should have been delivered in
this case. Any other would have required that the jury did not
follow the letter of the law,'' defense attorney Mike Grace said.
   Prosecutor Warren Sparrow said the case was difficult,
particularly because the state's lone psychiatrist supported the
defense argument that Hayes was insane at the time of the shootings.
   ``We presented our evidence in the best light. The jury has
spoken. We accept the verdict,'' Sparrow said in a statement.
   Selwyn Rose, a private psychiatrist hired by the defense,
testified earlier this week that Hayes believed he was part of
``God's army'' on a mission to destroy demons.

   President Ibrahim Babangida appealed to
Nigerians Friday to observe a government recommendation that
families have only four children, but he said no force would be
used to limit births.
   The West African nation's population is estimated at 114 million
with an annual growth rate of 3.3 percent. The present average is
six children per family.
   ``Let me stress that the policy is not a coercive measure, and
as such no special legal provisions for its enforcement have been
made,'' Babangida said.
   But he added: ``If women space their child bearing at intervals
of two or three years, or they decide not to give birth after 35,
then they would probably bear not more than four children.''
   Health Minister Olikoye Ransome-Kuti has said Nigeria seeks to
reduce the growth rate to 2.5 percent in 1995 and 2 percent in 2000.

   A Vietnamese delegation arrived in Hong Kong
Friday to arrange for the repatriation of 58 Vietnamese boat people
who want to return home.
   The four-member team is to interview and issue travel documents
to the returnees, government spokesman Akber Khan said.
   Last month 75 Vietnamese who fled their homeland and came to
this British colony voluntarily returned to Vietnam in the first
major repatriation of boat people in Hong Kong.
   Those and the members of the new group are among about 12,000
Vietnamese who arrived in the colony after the Hong Kong government
introduced a tough new policy last June. The policy regards those
refugees who arrived after June as illegal immigrants unless they
can prove they fled Vietnam because of persecution.
   More than 26,000 Vietnamese are now in Hong Kong, including more
than 2,000 who arrived this year. Vietnamese and Vietnamese of
Chinese descent are continuing to flee Vietnam, but the biggest
exodus occurred within months after communist forces defeated the
U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in the spring of 1975.
   Vietnam and the U.N. Office of High Commissioner for Refugees
signed an agreement last year for the voluntary return of refugees,
with Vietnam promising the returnees would not be mistreated and
the United Nations to provide reintegration assistance.

   Pulitzer prizes don't impress national
advertisers, but four-color graphics and younger readers do,
newspaper editors were told Friday by ad executives who said
editors must show that newspapers are not dinosaurs but are a
``hot, visible'' advertising medium.
   Newspapers must spruce up their images and use innovative ad
campaigns if they want take ad dollars away from television and
magazines, the executives told a session of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors convention.
   Robert Wehling, vice president marketing services at the
nation's second largest advertiser, Procter &amp; Gamble, said surveys
show that newspaper readers tend to be over 40, whereas advertisers
want to reach under-40 audiences.
   Magazines, he said, have better four-color printing capability
and magazines tend to be read more than once. Newspapers, he said,
get thrown out with the next day's trash.
   Newspapers also are cluttered and their ads don't show products
being used as well as television does, Wehling said.
   Most national advertisers ``see a significant cost
disadvantage'' in using newspapers when compared with television
and magazines, he said.
   ``There is simply no compelling reason for national advertisers
to redirect dollars to the newspaper medium,'' Wehling said.
   Newspapers could help themselves by emphasizing regional ad
campaigns, by giving advertisers better positions and by trying to
link local and national advertising campaigns, Wehling said.
   He said one bright star for national newspaper advertising has
been USA Today, where Procter &amp; Gamble's ads have increased for the
past three years and will continue to do so.
   Marianne Caponnnetto, senior vice president and media director
at Lord, Geller, Einstein, O'Neill and Partners in New York, said
USA Today sales people were ``extremely aggressive.''
   But that was the exception, she said, adding that even though
her jobs have included placing $50 million a year in ads for the
International Business Machines Corp., she could ``count on one
hand'' the number of newspaper sales executives she's ever met.
   Advertisers perceive newspaper sales personnel as ``order
takers,'' ``dull,'' not creative and ``just looking to sell
space,'' she said.
   Part of the problem is that young ad agency executives are
products of the TV age. They don't read newspapers as much, they
want exciting ad campaigns, and they don't want to expend their
energies on quarter-page newspaper ads.
   She also pointed out that a majority of Americans no longer get
most of their news from newspapers.
   Advertisers, she said, ``are indifferent to Pulitzer prizes.''
   Newspapers need to target special segments of their audiences _
geographically and demograghically, she said.
   ``Added value'' approaches such as joint promotions, research,
cross-media programs and merchandising are being used by magazines
``to protect their rate cards.''
   ``All of your major competitors are adapting to the requirement
of mixed marketing. It is time for you to do the same,'' she said.
   She said newspapers have ``the potential to launch a strong and
unified strategy that could open up significant opportunities for
sustained growth.''
   It also is time for editors to take more aggressive roles, she
said, and convince advertising craftsman ``that newspapers are a
hot, visible medium.''
   ``While you can't take the show biz away from TV, you can make
newspapers more appealing by demonstrating the inroads made in
areas like reproduction in four-color, by making newspapers more
profitable for agencies by standardizing contracts, invoices, rate
structures and by being more flexible with new positioning and
layout ideas,'' she said.
   She urged editors to ``Support your ad sales efforts to entice
new and repeat business with special incentives. Be innovative. ...
   ``The church and the state must work together to ensure the
preservation of the species. That doesn't mean that anyone's
integrity must be compromised. But in a fierce survival battle
you've got to operate as a team and understand one another's
business. The best way to protect your credibility and integrity is
to secure a sound business future.''

   Executives of three of the nation's largest
newspaper chains said consolidation in the newspaper business isn't
necessarily bad and that it may help protect the industry from
hostile takeovers by the ``apostles of greed.''
   The presidents of Knight-Ridder Inc., Times-Mirror and Gannett
Co. Inc. addressed the issue of public versus private ownership of
newspapers in a session of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors convention.
   They said that although those running publicly owned newspapers
have to pay attention to the stockholders, the financial bottom
line wasn't management's only consideration.
   ``We have a fine line to walk,'' Knight-Ridder President James
Batten said. ``We've got very solemn responsibilities to our
shareholders because, finally, it's their money.''
   Times Mirror President David Laventhol said ``There's no
question that we have to have some sense of responsibility to our
shareholders and investors.''
   But, he said, ``The idea that new owners come in and the first
thing they do is cut the editorial budget I would say is not a
realistic view of what has happened to newspapers in this country
that have been taken over by public owners. ...
   ``The biggest impact that public ownership has probably had on
newspapers ... is the ability of newspapers to invest much more
extensively than in most cases they would ever do under private
ownership,'' Laventhol said.
   He said Times Mirror ``agonized'' over the sales of the Dallas
Times-Herald and the Denver Post, but he said there have been large
increases in editorial staffs at the newspapers that have been
acquired by Times-Mirror.
   ``In many instances, despite all the rhetoric and clear pressure
on profits ... there is another part of the newspaper business,
which is news and information to make this a better world. And I
think even in our giant public companies of the people sitting up
here I think that's still a very primary motivation,'' Laventhol
said.
   Gannett President John Curley said the takeover ``threat'' was
not from ``not the major players'' in the business but from
``people who are looking toward getting in deeper in the media
business.''
   He said there also were ``apostles of greed'' who will try to
break up big companies and sell off their assets to pay the ``junk
bond'' deals that increasingly are financing large mergers.
   The entrepreneuers, however, ``overlook the fact that once you
sell some of the assets of some company ... there wouldn't be
enough left to meet their Drexel Burnham bills,'' Curley said.
   Curley said there was too much emphasis on increasing profit
margins to service debt from acquisitions.
   ``In running the paper you ought to focus on ... the advertising
side, what the market can do realistically, and then not try to
penalize the news side if it can't be done at a level that, let's
say, they can do in the Sun Belt,'' Curley said.
   ``On the other hand, I think we've got to be realistic that some
markets aren't ever going to grow and editors can't expect to add
10 to 15 percent editorial costs annually just to do nice things
when they're not ever going to see that growth,'' Curly said.
   Laventhol said the news media will be takeover targets as long
financing is available.
   ``I don't think it's going to go away, but in a way many
newspaper companies have gotten themselves in stronger position now
to fight that kind of thing than, say, they were four or five years
ago,'' Laventhol said.
   Batten noted entertainment mogul Burt Sugarman's failed attempt
to acquire Media General and rumors that the Bass brothers of Texas
were ``moving around'' Tribune stock.
   ``There are a lot of straws in the wind that are worrisome,''
Batten said.
   Laventhol noted, however, that new owners ``are keeping
newspapers alive. ... And I don't know if that's a terrible thing.''

   Numerous rainshowers and isolated thunderstorms spread across
the lower Mississippi Valley on Friday, ranging from eastern Texas
to the Ohio Valley, and bringing heavy downpours to southwestern
Louisiana.
   Thunderstorms at Lake Charles, La., dumped more than 1\ inches
of rain and threatened flooding in the low-lying areas.
   Rainshowers spread from eastern Texas into the lower Ohio
Valley, with many locations reporting less than a quarter-inch of
rainfall.
   A cold front curved from the Great Lakes into the central Plains
and central Rockies. Rainshowers were widely scattered from Lower
Michigan into southern Iowa.
   A cold front off the Pacific Northwest coast spread cloudiness
across the area.
   The low in the nation this morning was 13 degrees at Gunnison,
Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Iron Mountain and Thief River Falls, Minn., to 90
degrees at Blythe, Calif., and Phoenix.
   The national weather forecast for Saturday, showers will be
widespread from New England through the upper Ohio Valley into the
mid-Atlantic states. Showers and thunderstorms will occur from the
eastern Tennessee Valley through the southern Atlantic states into
the central and much of Florida. The remainder of the nation will
have pleasant weather, except the Pacific Northwest where scattered
showers are expected.
   High temperatures will be in the 60s or 70s across much of the
nation; in the 50s from the Great Lakes into the northern Atlantic
states; in the 80s over much of Florida, the southern tip of Texas,
and from interior parts of California into the southern Plateau;
and in the 90s across the desert Southwest.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George F. Burrows, a founding member in
1920 of the American Civil Liberties Union, is dead at age 89.
   Burrows, who died of a brain tumor Monday in a Waltham nursing
home, was described as a talented oddball whose passions ranged
from social justice to Sherlock Holmes.
   He was a New Deal Democrat who served as an early president of
the Community Church of Boston, the first church to demand a fair
trial for Sacco and Vanzetti. He also raised money to help defend
the nine black Scottsboro Boys in the famous 1931 rape case.
   ``My house was filled with causes,'' said his son, the actor and
author Orson Bean, in a telephone interview Friday from his home in
Venice, Calif. ``One day we would have the people in from the
radical organizations, the next day we'd have some typical Irish
pols from the local Democratic organization.''
   ``More different kinds of people liked him than anyone else I've
ever known,'' Bean added.
   Born in Somerville to a clan of strict Scottish fundamentalists,
Burrows dropped out of Harvard College and worked as a department
store clerk and an insurance adjuster.
   During the Depression he was an official with the U.S. Works
Progress Administration, where he hired musicians to perform in the
schools and artists to paint murals on public buildings. In World
War II he was a civillian employee of the U.S. Army in the Aleutian
Islands, but never told his son what he did.
   ``He claimed it was secret,'' said Bean.
   Burrows also worked in a Boston shipyard before returning to
Harvard, this time as a university policeman. He stayed 20 years.
   Once during a 1960s riot, he was bitten on the leg by a
Radcliffe student. ``I'm lucky she wasn't taller,'' he later
remarked.
   Fellow Harvard officers were surprised to learn of Burrows'
political activities and did not recall him ever mentioning them.
   Bean said his father's penchant for working at jobs that might
have been considered beneath him was ``almost an affectation.''
   ``He was a very learned person, but he hid his light under a
bushel,'' said Joan Shurcliff, who also worked for the
Massachusetts Civil Liberties Committee, as it was originally
called. ``I'm not sure that he had to be a Harvard Yard policeman
or show people around the Longfellow House but he loved doing it.
He loved life and he loved the scene.''
   Shurcliff said Burrows was an instrumental force when the
Massachusetts group merged with Roger Baldwin's New York-based ACLU
in the early 1940s.
   ``He was a quiet accomplisher, doing all the nitty-gritty work
in various organizations that required help in social justice,''
Shurcliff said.
   ``He was very mild, very gentle, an observer of life and yet had
a very strong sense of social justice,'' she said.
   Burrows also loved to join groups. He belonged to two Sherlock
Homes appreciation groups, the Baker Street Irregulars and The
Speckled Band, the Boston Browning Society, the Stratford Club of
Cambridge, Mensa, the Harvard Faculty Club, the New England
Astrological Association and the First Parish Unitarian in Harvard
Square, where he lived.
   Besides his son, Burrows leaves four grandchildren. A memorial
service is planned for May 15 at the First Parish Unitarian.

<HEAD>Hoffman Autopsy Inconclusive, Toxicology Tests Awaited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abbie Hoffman was taking prescription
drugs when he died and toxicology tests should reveal whether the
medicine killed him, the Bucks County coroner said Friday.
   Dr. Thomas Rosco refused to identify the medicine Hoffman was
taking. Asked if it was a potentially lethal drug, Rosco said,
``There are lots of drugs taken in high enough doses that can kill
you. That's what we're looking for.''
   Hoffman, 52, was found dead Wednesday in his rural New Hope
apartment. An autopsy Thursday night was inconclusive.
   ``When an autopsy is inconclusive, lots of times drugs or toxins
are a factor,'' Rosco said.
   ``What I have ruled out is homicide,'' Rosco said. ``The other
manners of death are natural causes, suicide or accidental and all
three of those are still being considered.''
   The toxicology tests won't be ready until the middle of next
week, he said.
   Rosco said he had no indication Hoffman had committed suicide,
as has been suggested by friends and family of the Yippie movement
founder.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Florence
Hoffman, Abbie's 83-year-old mother, said she thought suicide had
been ruled out.
   Mrs. Hoffman said her son had sounded depressed in recent
conversations with his brother, Jack. But the brother told
reporters that on Monday, when they last spoke, Hoffman ``seemed
all right, he seemed good.''.
   ``He's got a lot of battlescars on him,'' said Jack Hoffman.
``He's been arrested 55 times. You somewhat do get a little
disenchanted, but I don't think he got tired out. If Abbie had one
ounce of strength left in him, he'd go out and picket.''
   Ilya Hoffman, 26, and Andrew Hoffman, 28, two of the activist's
three children, said they did not believe their father commited
suicide. Andrew Hoffman, who lives in Boston along with his sister,
said he had spoken to his father on the phone a week ago.
   ``He was very happy and he wanted us to come down and visit,''
he said.

<HEAD>Jabril Says His Group Did Not Plant Bomb On Pan Am 103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ahmed Jabril, leader of a group suspected of
bombing Pan Am Flight 103, denies that his organization had any
role in the attack that killed 270 people in December.
   While denying any connection with the bombing, Jabril
acknowledged that his group routinely used the same kind of bomb
investigators say was used to blow up the Pan Am jumbo jet.
   A total of 259 people on the plane and 11 people on the ground
perished when the bomb blew the aircraft out of the skies over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
   In an interview broadcast Friday, Jabril told ABC-News that his
first lieutenant, Hafez Dalkamoni, commonly built and used the type
of explosive device that downed the Pan Am flight.
   Dalkamoni is in jail in Germany after a police raid last October
that netted weapons and three bomb devices like the one used to
blow up Flight 103.
   Jabril insisted that his group, the Syrian-sponsored Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, did not
plant the bomb on the airliner.
   Jabril also denied that his group receives money from Iran but
said he shared Iran's outrage at how the United States last year
shot down an Iran civilian passenger plane.
   ``I see now that the incident of the Pan Am is neither worse nor
uglier than the destruction of the Iranian air bus,'' Jabril told
ABC. ``Both of them are crimes against civilians whether by the
U.S. administration or by terrorist groups who may have blown up
the Pan Am. They are equally barbaric.''
   While denying his group's involvement, Jabril issued a warning
should the United States or Israel strike his camps in Syria. ``We
shall not remain still. Our response shall be equal if not more
violent,'' he said.
   Despite Jabril's denials, investigators suspect that his group
planted the bomb on an unwitting Pan Am passenger at the behest of
Iran.
   And although he said the barometer type bombs were used only in
the Middle East, German police found three Toshiba radio-cassette
players similar to the one used to blow up Flight 103 when they
arrested Dalkamoni last October.

   Warning labels on cigarette packs do not
give tobacco companies blanket immunity from lawsuits by victims of
lung cancer and other smoking-related ailments, the Minnesota
Supreme Court ruled Friday.
   The ruling required a lower court to reconsider a lawsuit by the
wife of a man who died of cancer four years ago after smoking
filterless Camel cigarettes for 30 years.
   Most lawsuits against tobacco companies have been dismissed
before going to trial. Michael Weiner, an attorney for plaintiff
Ann Forster, called the decision against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
maker of Camels, a major victory.
   Cigarette companies have been putting warning labels on their
products since the 1965 Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, but
Reynolds ``set out to do everything it could to show that that
(warning) label is not true,'' Weiner said in arguing the case Feb.
8.
   Jim Fyock, a Reynolds spokesman in Winston-Salem, N.C., said the
court had upheld the adequacy of the warnings, and said he was
confident the remaining points raised by the Forsters would be
rejected at trial.
   ``When the case is returned to the trial court, a central
element of the proceedings will be the established adequacy of
federally mandated warnings as a matter of law,'' Fyock said.
   John Forster, a businessman who died at age 46 in June 1985,
sued a few months before his death.
   He testifed that he began smoking partly because advertisements
suggested that it was a grown-up, manly thing to do. During the
1950s, cigarette companies advertised the so-called health benefits
of smoking.
   Forster said he had been able to overcome a drinking problem,
but could never quit the highly addictive leaf, despite hypnosis
and acupuncture treatment.
   Weiner said that even after warnings appeared on cigarette
packs, Forster continued relying on claims by the tobacco industry
that cigarettes were safe.
   John Strauch, a lawyer representing Reynolds, had argued that
Congress created the Federal Trade Commission to regulate cigarette
advertising, and that it had not intended individual courts and
juries to do it.
   But legal consideration of the case does not conflict with FTC
regulation ``so long as plaintiff does not claim the advertising
was deceptive because it did not adequately warn,'' Associate
Justice John Simonett wrote in the opinion.
   Weiner said Thursday that the court's ruling leaves most of his
case intact.
   Although the ruling states that Reynolds' warning is adequate,
it ``permits us to say what (Reynolds) did do is misleading, and
that's the major thrust of the case,'' Weiner said.
   The state of Minnesota, American Cancer Society, American Lung
Association, American Public Health Association and Minnesota Trial
Lawyer's Association joined his wife's case as friends-of-the-court.
   Forster's suit was dismissed in 1987 by Hennepin County District
Judge Jonathan Lebedoff, who ruled that the federal law preempted
such claims.
   Last year, the state Court of Appeals reversed Lebedoff and
ordered a trial, saying it could not ``immunize the tobacco
industry'' from lawsuits. Reynolds had appealed that ruling to the
Supreme Court.

<TEXT>
   Robbie Knievel soared easily over the Caesars
Palace fountains Friday night, safely finishing the same motorcycle
jump that nearly killed his daredevil father 22 years ago.
   Thousands of people who jammed the front of the resort cheered
as Knievel jumped his red motorcycle over the fountains and made a
perfect landing on a ramp about 180 feet from his takeoff point.
   The motorcycle landed at some 70 mph and he managed to avoid a
nearby concrete pillar and stop the bike before hitting a wall in
an underground parking garage less than the length of a football
field away.
   Knievel triumphantly rode out of the garage and back up the
landing ramp, where his father, Evel Knievel, ran out to hug him.
   ``That was for you dad, I love you,'' Knievel said to his
father, who spent 30 days in a coma after missing the same leap in
1967.
   Knievel landed just short of a huge white X on the 14-foot-wide
landing ramp and kept his hands on his handlebars as he soared over
the fountains.
   ``I thought I was going to land short like my dad and have to
deal with that,'' the daredevil said. ``I wanted to do it with no
hands but I held on because I thought I wasn't going fast enough.''
   Knievel became the first stuntman _ and possibly the last _ to
negotiate the fountains that critically injured his father and Gary
Wells, who crashed in 1980.
   ``Make it or miss it, there will be no more jumps after this,''
Rich Rose, a Caesars executive, said earlier.
   The daredevil was guaranteed $250,000 for the jump, but his take
could be much higher depending on the pay-per-view profits.
   Evel Knievel watched from only a few feet away as his son landed
easily and sped into the underground garage where a brain surgeon
and a dozen paramedics were waiting for the worst.
   ``I'm not the greatest daredevil in the world, I'm the father of
the greatest daredevil in the world,'' the 50-year-old Knievel said.
   It was the older Knievel who made the jump famous and turned
himself into a household name in the process when he crashed on
landing and flipped like a rag doll through the parking lot and
broke nearly ever bone in his body.
   But Robbie Knievel made it easily, much to the delight of the
crowd of some 20,000 people who jammed the Las Vegas Strip and
cheered as he made the leap.
   ``I'm going to have to make the perfect jump,'' he said this
week. ``I can't afford to be off even an inch.''
   And perfect it was as Knievel, after several aborted runs made
the final run.
   The jump capped a festive evening that featured Willie Nelson
singing ``America the Beautiful.''

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Families who traveled hundreds of miles
from across Mexico viewed mutilated corpses on Friday to learn
whether their missing loved ones were among the 13 victims of a
cult's human sacrifices.
   ``From all over the country, families have been coming here.
They're still coming,'' said Hector Olvera Garcia, an employee of a
funeral home, El Rosario, where seven bodies were taken after being
dug up at a ranch west of this border city.
   Authorities found 12 bodies buried there Tuesday and forced one
of the five suspects in custody to dig up the 13th victim on
Thursday.
   Investigators have used bulldozers and other heavy equipment to
excavate more of the ranch, but did not find any more bodies, said
Juan Benitez Ayala, chief of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in
Matamoros.
   The suspects told police they killed 14 people because they
believed it would protect them from harm. Authorities say they
belonged to a bizarre cult that smuggled more than a ton of
marijuana into the United States each week.
   Five of the 13 victims had been identified by Friday, and
federal charges were filed against four men in custody in Mexico; a
man and a woman thought to be the cult leaders and believed to be
in the United States and two newly indentified suspects also
believed to be in the United States.
   The four at large in the United States were Adolfo de Jesus
Constanzo, 26, nicknamed ``the godfather;'' Sara Maria Aldrete, 24,
``the godmother;'' Olvidio Hernandez Rivera, 26; and Alvaro de
Leon, in his early 20s.
   Police on both sides of the border searched for the Constanzo
and Aldrete, the suspected leaders of the cult who last were seen
in Brownsville Tuesday.
   Illinois State Police were given a description of the car Friday
after authorities in Brownsville, Texas, just across the border
from Matamoros, learned the pair have friends in the Chicago area.
   ``We think they might be coming this way,'' said Illinois State
Police Master Sgt. Clifford Mann, who added that Constanzo, known
as the cult's ``godfather,'' and Ms. Aldrete, its ``witch,'' had
not yet been seen.
   Constanzo has homes in Miami and Mexico City.
   The pall cast by the discovery of the gruesome human sacrifices
remained most evident at the funeral homes in Matamoros.
   More than 60 people came in search of missing relatives, Olvera
Garcia said. His clothes smelled of decomposing flesh after he
showed the bodies to several people looking for relatives who had
disappeared in recent months.
   The worst fears of the family of Ernesto Rivas Diaz, 23, came
true.
   ``It's something very sad,'' said Rivas Diaz's brother, Efrain,
who was picking up a death certificate for the young man who was
exhumed from a shallow grave at the Santa Elena Ranch 20 miles west
of Matamoros.
   The certificate listed the cause of death as ``Irreversible
lesion to a vital organ (brain).''
   Police said most of the cult's victims either died from blows
with a machete or a hammer. Some suffered horrible mutilations,
including the removal of brains and other organs in what suspects
have described as sacrificial rites of a cult seeking magical
protection for their drug-smuggling activities.
   The body of Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of Texas
student, was returned to the United States on Thursday, officials
said. His family returned to their hometown, Santa Fe, where a
funeral mass is planned for Saturday.
   The other identified victims were Victor Sauceda Galvan, 22, of
Matamoros, Mexico; Ruben Vela Garza, 30, of La Pesca, Mexico, and
Gilberto Garza Sosa, early 20s, nationality undetermined.
   One woman, Maria Cristina Cobos, traveled nearly 1,000 miles
from the southern city of Loma Bonita, Oaxaca, after reading news
reports. Her son, Enrique Grau Cobos, 38, has been missing since

daughter to another funeral home where other victims remained.
   ``Not knowing where he is is worse than finding him dead,'' said
Mrs. Cobos, 71, dressed in black, her eyes filling with tears.
``It's unbearable.''
   Jose Luis Martinez, a Mexican living in Brownsville just across
the Rio Grande, said relatives of his missing cousin, Francisco
Martinez, 22, were traveling from the western state of Durango.
   Martinez disappeared in Matamoros two months ago, he said.
   ``We're here to see if he might be one of them,'' Martinez said.
``The family needs to know.''

   The 1,000-ton Shippingport reactor vessel
was rolled off a Columbia River barge Thursday and headed for its
final resting place on the Hanford nuclear reservation, officials
said.
   The cylindrical vessel, from the world's first commercial
nuclear reactor, was cradled on a 320-wheel trailer after it was
rolled off the barge Paul Bunyan without incident, said Tom Bauman,
a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Energy.
   Friday the trailer will be moved about 13 miles and into a
40-foot deep trench, where the reactor vessel will be left for
burial, Bauman said.
   The reactor vessel arrived at the Port of Benton on Wednesday,
completing an 8,100-mile, 44-day waterborne journey from the
Shippingport Atomic Power Station, about 35 miles northwest of
Pittsburgh.
   The station was built by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and
commissioned in 1957. It was operated jointly with Duquesne Light
Co. to provide power for the Pittsburgh area.
   Shut down in 1982, the reactor's dismantling and burial has been
a pilot project for the decommissioning of other aging reactors.
Because the reactor is owned by the federal government, it was
slated for burial at Hanford.
   Hanford, best known as a site where plutonium is produced for
nuclear weapons, is also the burial ground for the reactor
compartments from four U.S. Navy submarines.
   The reactor vessel, which federal officials have said is
low-level radioactive waste and not considered very dangerous, went
down the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, through the
Panama Canal and up the Pacific Coast to the mouth of the Columbia.
   Protesters gathered at bridges above the Columbia to say they do
not want the river to become a highway for radioactive waste.
   The reactor vessel is 45 feet high and 18 feet across, and
contained the nuclear fuel during operation. The fuel was removed
in 1984, and a nuclear reaction is no longer possible. It is filled
with concrete and placed in a 6-inch-thick stainless steel box.

<HEAD>AMA Study Panel Concludes IUDs Can Be Safe, Effective for Some Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Progesterone-releasing and copper-containing
intrauterine devices can provide safe and effective contraception
for women in monogamous relationships during their middle or late
child-bearing years, a medical study panel finds.
   An estimated 60 million women worldwide use IUDs. The number in
this country is about 2 million and only two companies market them
in the United States after a series of expensive and
well-publicized product-liability trials.
   ``It's a limited endorsement, but on the other hand, there's a
large number of women who fit the criteria we set out for patient
selection,'' said Dr. William Scott, who chaired the American
Medical Association panel that reviewed medical literature on IUDs
and released its finding in Friday's Journal of the AMA.
   ``We found the IUD most useful for women in stable, monogamous
relationships who have already had their families and don't want to
take the (oral contraceptive) pill either because of inconvenience
or for fear of complications,'' he said.
   ``They (IUDs) were not recommended, however, for women with
multiple sexual partners, those with a history of pelvic
infections, bleeding disorders or previous ectopic pregnancies.''
   Progesterone-releasing IUDs secrete the hormone progesterone,
which in turn prevents a fertilized egg from attaching itself to
the uterine wall. Researchers believe copper as an IUD component
similarly inhibits implantation.
   While IUDs are ranked among the most effective means of
contraception, potential complications include perforation of the
uterus and pelvic infection, which can result in infertility.
   ``Quite frankly, the severe health risks far outweigh the
benefits gained _ especially with so many other effective methods
of birth control already available in the U.S.,'' said Guerry
Thornton Jr., an Atlanta-based attorney and products-liability
specialist.
   ``But if the medical profession is going to comment on this,
their warnings should be as explicit as possible,'' said Thornton,
who represented women in a lawsuit against Dalkon Shield
manufacturer A.H. Robins Co., which declared bankruptcy three years
ago citing IUD-related litigation.
   The panel's findings were welcomed, however, by Rod Mackenzie,
chairman and chief executive officer at GynoPharma, the Somerville,
N.J.-based firm that last May began marketing the only copper IUD
sold in the United States.
   ``We're heartened,'' Mackenzie said, ``but not at all surprised.
This has basically been the opinion of the medical profession for
some time.''
   Mackenzie declined to provide exact sales figures, but said that
``75 percent of gynecologists in this country have bought the
product from us and most have re-purchased.
   ``That fact and this report are two very encouraging comments,''
he added.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers and government
employees nationwide walked out Thursday in sympathy with 150
striking retirement fund employees, and scores of industries were
brought to a halt.
   The massive walkout was called by the Honduran Federation of
Workers, which claims a membership of 400,000. The organization
said it would not order its members to return to work until a labor
dispute at the School Teachers' Social Security Institute is
resolved.
   The institute handles a $150 million health insurance and
retirement benefits fund. Its 150 employees struck 16 days ago
demanding a 5 percent wage increase to compensate for higher living
costs. Employees now earn $500 to $3,000 a month, depending on
seniority.
   The teachers' union, which has 40,000 members, has refused to
negotiate and threatened to strike if the social security workers
do not return to work.
   But all 80,000 government employees responded to the call by the
Honduran Federation of Workers for a walkout early Thursday.
   They were joined at midday by workers at the Texaco Refinery
owned by Exxon Corp., and truck drivers. Other federation unions
promised to join later.
   Texaco is the country's only refinery, but there was no
immediate scarcity of gasoline at service stations.
   Hundreds of sympathy strikers blocked traffic on roads and
highways in the capital of Tegucigalpa and at San Pedro Sula,
Honduras' second-largest city and 125 miles north. There were no
reports of violence.
   ``We workers are willing to fight for this to the utmost of
consequences and we will continue on strike until we reach our
goals,'' federation president Mariano de Jesus Gonzalez said.
   President Jose Azcona Hoyo's administration said it was
``totally unacceptable that actions were undertaken that could
provoke anarchy and endanger the democratic stability of the
country, which has required much sacrifice by the people.''

   Congressional approval of a compromise $49.7
million package of non-military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels gives
President Bush bipartisan support to pressure the Sandinista
government into keeping its promises on instituting democratic
reforms, lawmakers say.
   ``I think we've made a step in the right direction,'' Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Thursday moments after the
Senate voted 89-9 to approve the plan. ``Now we can be an active
player in that part of the world.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who hammered out the plan
with Senate and House leaders, has said the history of disagreement
between the Democratic-controlled Congress and the Republican White
House over Central America has hamstrung U.S. policy toward the
region.
   The accord provides ``an opportunity to put behind us one of the
most divisive foreign policy issues in post-war history and embark
on a new, more hopeful diplomacy toward Central America,'' Baker
said earlier in the week.

   The ruling Sandinista party says it
will build up its defenses in response to Congress' decision to
give $50 million in humanitarian aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The Sandinista National Liberation Front on Thursday issued a
statement after the Senate vote, saying its members ``repudiate the
approval of these new funds by the U.S. Congress for the mercenary
forces.''
   Both houses voted overwhelmingly Thursday in favor of the new
aid.
   ``This has violated one more time the rights and the order of
international justice and makes fun of the will of the Central
American presidents, as expressed in the document of Costa del Sol,
El Salvador, on Feb. 14,'' the Sandinista party said.

   In newspaper columns and editorial

defiled Prince William Sound and imperiled livelihoods drawn from
the sea.
   The volume of letters to newspaper editors in some areas remains
high even three weeks after the spill that sent 10.1 million
gallons of oil into the sound, and at least two editorial boards
have recast their positions on a tax change for oil companies.
   Editors of the two Anchorage daily newspapers said they can
think of no other issue that has generated so much mail. Much of it

and Hungary in July as opportunity beckons for the United States to
promote political reform and capitalism in Eastern Europe.
   The two countries are at the head of the pack, Poland in
recognizing the trade union movement Solidarity, Hungary in raising
living standards and even permitting a stock exchange to operate.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a speech last month in

   Once the Monday deadline for filing 1988
federal income-tax returns passes, the average worker still will
have to toil an additional 17 days before having earned what
government tax collectors will demand for 1989.
   ``Tax Freedom Day'' arrives this year on May 4. It has not been
later since the Tax Foundation began calculating this measure of
the burden imposed on workers by federal, state and local
governments. It was Feb. 13 in 1930.
   By the foundation's calculations, the average worker will work
124 days this year just to pay taxes. So, if the government
demanded its money up front, it would take all of the average
worker's income through May 4.
   That is the same as the last two years _ in fact, it is the same
as in 1981, when Congress and President Reagan agreed on the
biggest tax cut in the nation's history.

   President Bush and congressional leaders
Friday announced a showpiece budget compromise to reduce the 1990
federal deficit to under $100 billion without raising taxes.
   But the pact puts off most hard decisions and Democratic leaders
suggested it could open the way to tax increases next year.
   Bush, flanked by top lawmakers at a White House ceremony,
boasted they had accomplished ``the first such agreement reached
ahead of schedule and not framed in the context of a crisis.'' He
called it a ``first manageable step'' in the deficit-fighting
journey.
   The plan would enable Bush to say he is holding to his ``no new
taxes'' campaign pledge, while trimming the budget deficit to $99.4
billion, just within the $100 billion target set by the
Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Friday that Mikhail S. Gorbachev's critics may try to stifle his
economic reform program unless he succeeds in getting ``consumer
goods on the table and in the markets.''
   Baker said that the political reforms Gorbachev has pushed as
part of ``perestroika,'' or restructuring, are progressing faster
than his economic reforms.
   ``That might trigger something,'' he said. ``These things
generally have to proceed apace.''
   Addressing the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the
secretary commented:
   ``If they are unable to get the economic part of this going and
going well so there are consumer goods on the table and in the

the part of some that this idea of perestroika doesn't mean much to
the common man or woman in the Soviet Union.''

   A century after Earlham College started
training Quaker missionaries bound for Asia, its ties with Japan
are paying off as Indiana maneuvers to cash in on that country's
growing U.S. investments.
   ``Japan is the excuse, but international education is the
goal,'' said Jackson Bailey, founder of Earlham's Institute for
Education on Japan. ``We are very careful not to say, `Come on, get
on the Japanese bandwagon.' That's not the idea at all. Five years
from now, it could be something else.''
   Meanwhile, Earlham has trained Hoosier businesspeople in
Japanese language and customs and has helped 16 school systems
introduce Japanese curricula.
   In Gary, school officials expect 300 students _ including 100
fourth-graders _ to enroll next fall in introductory Japanese. A
survey showed 512 of the 713 high school language students would
like to study Japanese.
   ``There's an extraordinary interest,'' said Anne Thompson,
supervisor of foreign languages for the Gary Community School Corp.
``Japan is in the news. This is a steel community. The fact that
America has lost the edge in the steel world and automobile world
to Japan is recognizable in this community.''
   Subaru-Isuzu Automotive will open an assembly plant with
Japanese management this year in Lafayette. The Lafayette, West
Lafayette and Tippecanoe County school systems, which have
international students connected with Purdue University, have taken
part jointly in Earlham's program. Four high schools now offer
first-year Japanese and study Japan in art, English and social
studies.
   ``It was certainly a well-timed opportunity for us to be
involved in this project. We spend a lot of time with the people
from Japan,'' said Charlotte McGaw, assistant principal at
Lafayette Jefferson High School.
   State Superintendent of Public Instruction H. Dean Evans and
then-Gov. Robert D. Orr asked Earlham four years ago to design an
international education program. Earlham, through a grant from the
Lilly Endowment, already had a pilot program that sent
Richmond-area teachers to Japan for six weeks. It now chooses five
systems a year to send people for two weeks here and three weeks in
Japan.
   For Earlham, it's the manifestation of a century-old
relationship with what was once one of the world's most closed
cultures. From 1893, when it graduated its first Japanese student,
until World War II, Earlham-trained missionaries and educators
headed for Japan, one as tutor to the empire's crown prince.
   The ties grew after World War II when some of the
Japanese-Americans who had been interned chose to study at the
Indiana college they had learned about from the Quaker
conscientious objectors that also had been jailed.
   Bailey, a conscientious objector who served in the Army Medical
Corps, spent a year in Japan during the occupation. He later
returned for three years with his wife and children as part of the
Quakers' American Friends Service Committee doing relief work in
orphanages, schools and neighborhood centers.
   The immersion in the foreign culture ``converted me to
international education. You enrich your definition of what it is
to be human,'' said Bailey, who in December received Japan's Order
of the Sacred Treasure.
   Within four years of his 1959 return to Earlham, the college was
operating a Japanese exchange program for a group of Midwestern
colleges. Other programs were added in 1973 and 1979, and there's
now talk of adding a fourth program so the school can accommodate
all of its students who want to study in Japan. This year Earlham,
a school of 1,200 students, had 65 studying first-year Japanese.
   About 10 percent of the Earlham faculty is bilingual in Japanese
and nearly one-third have worked there, many through the
sponsorship of the college, which seeks out a Japanese background
in prospective faculty members. Japan pervades the curriculum, from
social sciences to fine arts, and the school has adopted management
methods that have proven successful in Japanese industry.
   That isn't to say, however, that Earlham excludes other
cultures. More than half its students study abroad for at least six
months, compared with 1 percent of U.S. college students who study
abroad before graduating.
   Nonetheless, school President Richard J. Wood is counting on
Earlham's friends in Japan to raise $1 million for an endowed chair
in Japanese studies. ``We think it will be a recognition of the 30
years of work we've done to raise the level of Japanese studies in
the United States.
   ``Because we were there long before there was a wave of
interest, we are trying to take advantage of that wave of interest.
   ``The importance of Japan to the American economy will not go
down ... in the next 10 to 15 years.''

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The left that startled the nation with its
unity and a strong second place showing in last summer's
presidential election has tumbled back into disarray.
   The fragile coalition has been unable to turn an outpouring of
support for presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas into a solid
front and has come out of a series of state and local elections as
divided losers.
   Leaders say they're not suprised, but they're not giving up.
   ``They were four parties that had a single candidate for the
presidency but nothing more,'' said Heberto Castillo, the Mexican
Socialist Party's presidential candidate who threw his support to
Cardenas a month before the July election and has worked with him
ever since.
   ``We could unite around a candidate for president but not for
deputies and senators. That's why we lost.''
   The four parties parties, ranging from center-left to left, that
were the core of the National Democratic Front have balked at
giving up their names, platforms, claim to congressional seats,
share of government funds and privileges for the sake of a larger,
potentially more effective, opposition.
   One has effectively re-allied itself with the long-governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in March, a move leaders
say broke the alliance.
   The leftist parties engage in public and private infighting.
Regional frictions add to national ones when the parties try to
agree on joint candidates for state and local races, further
weakening their image.
   Although the front is still mentioned in connection with
possible joint candidacies for state or local elections, leaders
say it was formed to fight the PRI and likely will be replaced by
another alliance.
   ``We need a more suitable, discreet, type of conduct,'' said
Sen. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a former head of the PRI who became a
leader and strategist of the leftist opposition. ``If we're allies
we need to overlook many differences.''
   Some members of the opposition applied March 31 to register the
Democratic Revolution Party, which is to absorb the Socialist
Party. Socialist leader Castillo said the party is having a
``painful birth;'' none of the others have agreed to join.
   The Democratic Front came about because Cardenas was a reformist
who was shut out of the PRI. After he became the presidential
candidate of a small leftist party and his popularity soared,
bringing endorsements of two similar parties and the Socialists,
the largest leftist party.
   In dealing the PRI one of its worst blows in its 60-year
history, Cardenas took 31 percent of the vote. The victor, the
PRI's Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was held to just over 50 percent,
the slimmest presidential victory ever for the PRI. The
conservative National Action Party, long the main opposition,
received 17 percent.
   On Cardenas' coattails, the left captured four of the Senate's
64 seats, the first ever won by the opposition, and expanded its
bloc in the Chamber of Deputies.
   With National Action, it held the PRI to a 10-seat margin in the
500-seat chamber. Small parties, at least one in danger of losing
its registration, gained needed votes.
   The left blames the PRI government, known for co-opting and
manipulating the opposition, for some of its troubles.
   In addition to pressuring parties, the government is using its
strong influence over the news media and changes in local election
laws to thwart the left, Castillo claimed.
   The opposition was not allowed to register joint candidates in
Veracruz state elections in October but has had trouble even when
permitted.
   In Baja California, where Cardenas won last year, only Cardenas'
party and one other could agree on a candidate for the upcoming
governor's race. Two others decided to back another, or possibly
the PRI nominee. There is even talk of an alliance with National
Action.
   At the same time, Salinas has strengthened his image with
attacks on union corruption and drug trafficking, although his
toughest tests will be foreign debt negotiations and electoral
reform, both under way.
   Lorenzo Meyer of the Colegio de Mexico, a graduate school, said
the left is going through what could be a healthy sifting-out
process but needs to offer a concrete program for the country.
   ``With a mixture of good luck, intelligence and will, the
hardships of today can be not the beginning of the end for the
center-left opposition but its difficult but necessary purgatory to
achieve internal cohesion,'' Meyer wrote recently in a front-page
column in Excelsior, one of Mexico's leading newspapers.
   Castillo said the new party wants political competition and
better distribution of wealth but would respect the private sector.
   At least 4{ million of the 6 million votes officially registered
for Cardenas came from people outside the registered parties,
Castillo said.
   ``The political culture of this country is changing
substantially,'' he said. ``Before the (July) elections people
thought it was impossible to defeat the PRI. ... Now the people
think it is possible.''

   Blair Brown throws open the door of her dressing
room et voila! _ the pale blue dress she has just taken off is
standing upright on the floor as if someone were still in it.
   ``It's been a long time since you wore clothes that could do
that,'' Brown says of the polyester frock, her attire for a '50s
sitcom dream sequence in an episode of ``The Days and Nights of
Molly Dodd'' being filmed on a soundstage in Astoria, Queens.
   Thirteen new episodes of the offbeat comedy-drama that left NBC
last summer begin airing on the Lifetime Television cable network
tonight.
   In the episode being filmed, the 12th of the 13, Molly thinks
she might be pregnant, but isn't sure which beau is the father. In
the dream sequence, Molly is a sitcom mom, flitting from TV to baby
carriage to kitchen, serving the demands of three undershirt-clad
husbands: bookseller Moss Goodman (David Strathairn) turned
construction worker, black detective Nathaniel Hawthorne (Richard
Lawson) as grocer, and doorman Davey (James Greene), still a
doorman.
   The cast is the same, the look is the same, but it's a big jump
from the No. 1 network to a small cable channel.
   ``If one more person comes up to me on the street and says, `I
love your show. When is it going to be on again?' or, `I love your
show, but I don't get cable,''' Brown said with a sigh. ``I mean, I
feel we're a little early in that sense for cable. I bet in a
couple of years this will all be very different.
   ``It's really disheartening, that, because you think, well, our
work is better this year and yet fewer people can possibly see it.''
   Nevertheless, she and producer Jay Tarses are happy enough just
to be in production.
   ``They've been unbelievably nice,'' Tarses said of Lifetime. ``I
mean, they want us. They make us feel as if we're the answer to
whatever prayers they have, and it's a terrific feeling to not feel
like somebody's stepsister. At NBC, they just kept putting up as
many obstacles as they could hoping someday we'd trip over one, and
eventually we did. Lifetime just wants us here. They're happy we're
here.''
   The series did well in the ratings and received raves from
critics when it first appeared as a spring replacement on NBC in
1987. The premise was simple: Brown as a divorced New York woman
struggling with an irresponsible ex-husband, a fretful mom and a
nonexistent career. It wasn't ``Mary Tyler Moore.''
   NBC didn't bring the show back until the following spring, and
then it got a slot in the boffo Thursday comedy lineup following
``The Cosby Show.'' When it landed only in the top 20 instead of
the top 10, it was moved to another time period where its ratings
dwindled before it was canceled.
   Lifetime, which caters to female viewers with health and
lifestyle shows and reruns of such series as ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,''
picked it up last summer, and Tarses moved the production from Los
Angeles to Queens.
   ``We figure next year we'll be working offshore,'' Brown said,
laughing. ``We'll be the first offshore television show outside the
20-mile limit shooting on a boat and sending it back, because they
can't get rid of us, try as they may.''
   Ironically, she noted, the show is now shot on a soundstage next
door to ``The Cosby Show.''
   Tarses had complained, at times bitterly, about the way ``Molly
Dodd'' was treated by NBC Entertainment President Brandon
Tartikoff, who thought it too weird for a mass audience.
   Tartikoff stopped by the set recently and joked that he was
announcing a network pickup. Tarses shrugged. ``I like him,'' he
said. ``He's got a job to do. His job is to be No. 1.''
   Tarses will find out in May if Lifetime wants to continue the
costly production of ``Molly Dodd.'' If not, he's reluctant to
return to a network. ``Never's a long time,'' he said, ``but I hope
I don't have to go back and do that again. I'm willing _ if they
give me a 66-show commitment.''
   The split with NBC wasn't necessarily permanent, even if it did
get a little vitriolic in the press. Tarses does have an in at the
network. His daughter, Jamie, is director of comedy development.
   ``I did say I wasn't going to do anything for a while, but
they'd be crazy not to come back to me,'' said Tarses, with a grin.
``I'm a genius.''

   The 10.1 million-gallon oil spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound, where emergency teams were unprepared and
slow to respond, has drawn attention to preparedness in California
and the Gulf of Mexico, where oil rigs and tankers make similar
disasters possible. AP writers Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans
and Jeff Wilson in Los Angeles found that a spill there the size of
the one from the Exxon Valdez would be just as hard to handle.

   The Exxon Valdez spill has focused the nation's attention on
Alaska's oilfields, but rigs are pumping crude and tankers plying
the waters off other U.S. shores that could be just as devastated _
and just as hard to clean.
   And while cleanup companies backed by the oil industry say
they're poised to respond ``on a moment's notice'' to spills along
the California and Gulf of Mexico coasts, state officials are leery
of such claims, and say the only way to prevent damage from oil
spills is to prevent the spills.
   ``The lesson of the Valdez is clear: We cannot rely on oil
company representations that they can handle a spill,'' said
California Controller Gray Davis, who wants the Coast Guard in
charge of directing cleanups ``to avoid the type of disorganization
which seriously delayed action'' in Alaska. ``We cannot afford to
sacrifice our coastline to bureaucratic bickering,'' Davis said.
   More than 10 million gallons of oil spilled on Good Friday when
the Exxon Valdez hit a reef near Valdez, Alaska. Because a response
team was disbanded in 1982, it took 11 hours before booms were
placed around the fractured tanker, and only about 8 percent of the
spilled crude has been recovered.
   ``I don't know as anybody would ever be totally prepared to deal
with that quantity of oil,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Bob Pond in
New Orleans.
   ``I feel very strongly that if we had a spill of that magnitude,
we would not be able to contain it,'' said Bruce Hammett, emergency
response coordinator for the Louisiana Department of Environmental
Quality. ``The thing we would have to look at is trying to minimize
damage...
   ``I just don't think we have the necessary booms, manpower,
equipment and expertise to try to contain something like that.''
   Hammett believes that planners along the Gulf have grown
complacent in the five years since the last major spill, 2.7
million gallons from the Alvenus, a tanker that ran out of a
shipping channel and cracked open on a mud bottom near Cameron, La.
Oil from the spill washed onto Galveston, Texas, beaches.
   In the Gulf of Mexico, three cleanup companies under contract to
the Coast Gaurd have a total of 4,600 feet of containment booms
along with several boats, pumps and skimmers to clean oil from
water. Clean Gulf Associates, a consortium of 166 oil and gas
companies, has 5,000 feet of booms, more than 39,300 gallons of
chemical dispersant and boats with equipment to suck up oil. Clean
Gulf's members must practice at least once a year with the cleanup
equipment.
   A spill of any size in the Gulf would be fought under a plan
developed by the states, Coast Guard, Interior Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency. In California, the Coastal
Commission is responsible under state law for containing and
cleaning spills; it admitted in 1986 that it can't.
   In the past two years, the Southern California coastline was
polluted by 67,510 gallons of oil, of which 16,035 gallons were
never recovered. More than 1,150 tankers dock in Los Angeles every
year, and dozens of drilling platforms have raised concerns over
federal plans to lease additional oil reserves. An improperly cased
well was blamed for a 1969 spill off Santa Barbara of more than
3.25 million gallons of oil that dirtied 100 miles of coastline.
   California's three industry-financed cleanup cooperatives have a
DC-4 aircraft on standby in Mesa, Ariz., equipped to spray 2,000
gallons of chemical dispersants. They also have a total of 100,000
feet of booms, 30,000 gallons of dispersants, and about two dozen
boats of various sizes equipped for cleanups.
   But that equipment is in San Francisco, Santa Barbara and Los
Angeles, so the northern part of California's 800-mile coast
remains at risk. ``That is the most vulnerable spot in terms of
equipment,'' said Cmdr. Scott Porter, chief of environmental
protection and port safety for the 11th Coast Guard District.
   Jack Mortenson of Clean Bay conceded it would take a day for
boats from his San Francisco-based cleanup company to arrive in
Eureka near the Oregon border.
   ``Whether we could arrive in Eureka in time to be effective is a
question of which direction the wind is blowing,'' said Mortenson,
adding there was some leeway because tankers travel at least 50
miles offshore.
   ``Having no response ships in the north is one indication the
oil companies aren't as prepared as their public relations
departments would have us believe,'' said California Lt. Gov. Leo
McCarthy.
   In the Gulf, Louisiana's fragile marshes are of great concern.
Planners would rather see oil wash onto a beach than onto marshes
where shrimp and fish spawn, oysters are harvested, and nutria and
otter are trapped. ``You're going to do more environmental harm by
cutting out grasses and mucking through the estuary than you are
going to help by cleaning the oil up,'' said Pond.
   Prevailing currents and winds that would steer most spills away
from the marshes are the best protection Louisiana has, he said.
   Cleanup planning is harder in the Gulf than Alaska, which
exports just a few types of oil, Hammett said. ``Here in the Gulf
we receive just about every variation on crude oil imaginable ...
and each crude oil is different from the next. You have to look at
the toxic effects of each oil ... and what is at risk at various
times of the year _ whether seabirds are nesting, mammals having
young, whether it's shrimp season, oyster season, what have you.''
   In addition, the Gulf's shipping hazards _ production platforms
and crowded shipping lanes dredged through shallow bottoms _ can
hamper cleanup. The rigs can snag and tear booms, which don't work
too well unless the water is calm.
   ``If you don't have booms there very quickly, the oil is going
to spread quickly in all directions on the surface,'' Pond said.
``You'd just need an enormous amount of boom to even think of
containing it.''
   California Coastal Commission documents show that skimmers, the
main mechanical tools for cleaning up oil, work best in absolutely
calm waters. But even then, skimmers pick up only about 50 percent
of the oil they can reach. As waves reach about 2 feet, the
recovery rate drops to between 20 percent and 30 percent. With
six-foot waves, skimmers are virtually useless.
   The other method for breaking up oil spills _ pouring
dispersants into the water _ is controversial because of the
toxicity of the chemicals.
   ``I think there is no question that a large incident such as
occurred offshore in Alaska could occur off shore in California,''
said Peter Douglas, executive director of the California Coastal
Commission.
   ``We are at risk,'' said Kim McCleneghan of California's Fish
and Game Department.

<HEAD>Former Radicals Carve Out Thriving Careers as Authors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are former radicals whose thriving career as
a best-selling team of authors is testament to their rebirth as
conservatives.
   And their impassioned defense of the right is not unlike their
crusade on behalf of the left two decades ago.
   But given their dramatic change in politics and lifestyles,
Peter Collier and David Horowitz may have a more highly developed
sense of irony. Witness the T-shirt Horowitz wore during a recent
publicity tour to promote their latest book, ``Destructive
Generation _ Second Thoughts About the '60s'' (Summit Books,
$19.95).
   The words in Russian, emblazoned above a red star, translated to
``God Bless America.''
   Collier, 49, and Horowitz, 50, became friends while graduate
students at the University of California at Berkeley, and later
edited the leftist magazine, Ramparts. They are the authors of
three successful books, ``The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty,''
``The Fords: An American Drama'' and ``The Kennedys: An American
Epic.''
   Collier does the majority of the writing and Horowitz does much
of the legwork. Their most successful book was ``The Kennedys,''
which was also the most controversial. Its 1984 publication
coincided with the drug overdose death of David Kennedy.
   Now comes the nagging ``Destructive Generation,'' which makes
Tom Hayden's transition from fiery radical to California
legislator, or Jerry Rubin's transformation from yippie to
corporate networker seem mild by comparison.
   Collier and Horowitz, who bill their new book as the first to
examine the 1960s in a critical light, are not unlike unruly
schoolboys who have suddenly surfaced as hall monitors.
   In their own words, they see themselves as spokesmen for ``a
generation of people who refuse to be responsible for what they've
done.''
   ``The '60s were a great party. Now it's the big hangover,'' said
Collier. ``Most of what's been written up to now have been attempts
to romanticize the '60s. We're trying to provide an antidote to
that.''
   Their thesis is stern and unyielding: the '60s was a time of
naive idealism rooted in an inherent destructiveness.
   Collier and Horowitz argue that the antiwar, antiauthority,
pro-drug culture of the '60s resulted in a breakdown of the system
and the destruction of authority. Far from offering concrete
remedies for society, '60s leftists came up with ``jerry-built''
solutions that turned out to be disastrous.
   ``There was a basic social lawlessness in the '60s,'' Collier
said. ``We romanticized crime figures. We romanticized drugs. We
attacked authority at every level. The epidemic of crime is
directly related to drugs.''
   ``When you're young, you have great optimism,'' said Horowitz,
who recalls being taken to many Soviet-made movies by his parents,
both avowed communists. ``It's naivete at one point and then it
becomes destructive.''
   ``Destructive Generation,'' much of which originally appeared in
magazines such as Playboy, Rolling Stone and California, chronicles
what are seen as the ultimately ineffectual lives and times of
Black Panther defense attorney Fay Stender and the Weather
Underground.
   The personal odyssey of Collier and Horowitz from zealous
Marxists to staunch Reagan supporters is tacked onto the end of the
book.
   When they talk politics now, they praise authority figures
rather than revile them.
   ``We saw what Reagan did,'' said Horowitz, explaining their long
evolution from left to right. ``He restored pride in this country.
Reagan helped people who were looking for freedom all over the
world.''
   As part of the publicity tour for the book, Collier and Horowitz
already have engaged in several television debates with prominent
members of the left. The exchanges have been heated.
   The two are quick to point out that they have lost many friends
since joining the conservative cause. They also are prone to
defensiveness when asked questions they perceive imply that they
sold out for the sake of writing lucrative best sellers.
   They claim they paid a high price for their journey from humble
radicals to popular authors. ``We're stigmatized as troglodytes,''
said Collier.
   ``When I lived inside the Marxist myth, it made me very
strong,'' said Horowitz. ``When I lost my faith, I lost my
confidence. I was no longer part of something which gives you
strength.''
   Next on the Collier-Horowitz agenda: a biography of the
Roosevelts.

<HEAD>Popularity of Once-Hailed Portuguese Military Now Flagging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On April 25, 1974, soldiers under the
command of young left-leaning army captains toppled a 48-year
dictatorship and were showered with red carnations by rejoicing
civilians.
   Fifteen years after the ``Revolution of the Carnations,'' the
Portuguese armed forces are back under right-wing leadership,
facing flagging popularity and an urgent need for reform.
   The decision by Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, a Social
Democrat, to name the conservative Gen. Antonio Soares Carneiro as
armed forces chief over the army's own, more moderate candidate has
stirred discontent even within the military.
   The controversy comes at a time when cooperation between
generals and politicians is seen as important for the success of a
four-year plan to trim military manpower and modernize equipment.
   ``Soares Carneiro was not chosen by the army _ it was obviously
some sort of political compensation,'' said Maria Carrilho, a
leading sociologist and author of ``The Armed Forces and Political
Change in 20th Century Portugal.''
   ``It shows party politics and the military are still too closely
interconnected in Portugal, something that shouldn't be the case in
a consolidated democracy.''
   In 1980, Soares Carneiro ran for president as the candidate of
the Conservative alliance that joined the Social Democrats with the
right-wing Social Democratic Center.
   His campaign collapsed after reports were published that he had
authorized the internment of opponents of the Portuguese
dictatorship in a ``recuperation camp'' in Angola toward the end of
Portugal's African colonial wars in the early 1970s.
   Former officers who took part in the 1974 revolution say a
traditionalist resurgence in the military is likely to further
taint the forces' already flagging prestige among Portuguese youth.
   ``In the period following the revolution, soldiers were the only
ones the people would trust,'' said Lt. Col. Vasco Lourenco, a
revolutionary captain in 1974. ``Today, the armed forces are almost
ashamed to have had anything to do with April 25 and have withdrawn
into a shell.''
   Ms. Carrilho said that since the abolition in 1982 of the
governing Revolutionary Council, which was dominated by the
military, politicians have moved anybody linked to April 25 out of
influential positions.
   Lourenco, who now heads the private April 25 Association he
co-founded after military and government formally split in 1982,
complains that military men today haven't been able to make
civilians understand the role of the military in democratic
Portugal.
   ``Nowadays, the armed forces sense a certain rejection in
Portuguese society,'' said Lt. Col. Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, the
mastermind of the 1974 coup who was sentenced last year to 15 years
in prison on charges of being the leader of a left-wing urban
terrorist group.
   ``Although the masses still have a soft spot for the soldier of
April 25,'' he said in a prison interview, ``people are now asking
_ why do these guys exist? Portugal's not at war, so what are they
doing? They don't produce anything.''
   A recent survey by Lisbon University indicated that 66 percent
of recruits performing obligatory military service think the draft
should be done away with and that service in the armed forces
should be voluntary.
   ``With relations improving between the United States and the
Soviet Union, it's natural that young people all over the world are
asking themselves what the armed forces are for,'' said Gen. Amadeo
Garcia dos Santos, who sees reform long overdue.
   ``The army today is more or less what it was before the
revolution, in terms of structure, mentality and equipment.''
   Military analysts say Portugal's 90,000-member armed forces are
still large for a small country of just over 10 million people,
even though it is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The need for large land forces to fight the colonial wars in
Africa has left an imbalance among the three service branches.
   The army has about 45,000 active soldiers, making it three times
larger than the air force and the navy.
   But this could change as Portugal strives for a more active role
in NATO.
   According to Alvaro Vasconcelos at Lisbon's Institute for
International and Strategic Studies, Portugal's aim is to play a
more important role in anti-submarine warfare, which would require
greater naval and air strength.

<DATELINE>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian protesters claim to have
increasing influence on commercial advertisers on television.
   The American Family Association, based here, called off its
boycott of the Pepsi Cola Co. after the company dropped plans to
run more ads featuring segments of pop star Madonna's video ``Like
a Prayer.''
   The Christian association had called for a Pepsi Cola boycott to
protest what it considered sacrilegious imagery in the sensual
video. Roman Catholic Bishop Rene H. Gracida of Corpus Christi,
Texas, also had urged people to boycott Pepsi products.
   ``We think Pepsi has made a very wise business and moral
decision,'' the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, AFA executive director,
said after the ad was withdrawn.
   In announcing the move, Pepsi Cola did not acknowledge that the
Christian protests influenced its decision. The company said,
however, that many people seemed to be confusing the video and the
Pepsi ad, which did not include the video segments most objected to
by those protesting the performance.
   Wildmon also noted that some advertisers canceled ads on the
show ``Saturday Night Live'' after protests of the program's
contents by the association.
   ``More and more corporations are beginning to say no to the
exploitative and anti-Christian programming of the networks,'' he
says.

   ``Ambiguous cases will either require painful and embarrassing

<HEAD>Minimum Wage, Minimum Impact?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Measured by the emotions generated, the minimum
wage bill now being refined by Senate-House conferees is a
significant legislative effort. A threatened veto by President Bush
adds to that impression.
   Measured on its potential economic impact on the national
economy, however, it may be a far less important piece of
legislation. To some extent, it is merely recognizing what already
has occurred.
   In large areas of the country, for instance, employers long ago
gave up efforts to hire unskilled help at the minimum wage of
$3.35. For many months they have been offering considerably more _
even double the minimum.
   The $3.35 wage has been in place for eight years, a period
during which almost every full-time worker received some sort of
raise, if only to keep pace with inflation. In effect, the minimum
wage went backward during this time.
   The Senate and House bills that have just been passed would
raise that wage to $4.55 an hour by October 1, 1991, or more than
two years from now. But even then it would hardly match the wages
available today in many states.
   That is not the only reason why the impact might be muted.
Another is that 11 states already have higher minimums than the
federal rate. Still another is that many companies have the option
of automating instead of employing.
   In fact, one of the sturdiest arguments against raising the
minimum wage rate is the belief that small companies will simply
eliminate minimum wage jobs and large companies will seek to
automate such positions out of existence.
   Further support for the minimum wage-minimum impact argument is
evidence that workers with potential seldom stay at the lowest wage
anyway, usually advancing to higher-paying jobs or quitting.
   In spite of this evidence, great emotions are generated whenever
the minimum wage is discussed, and sometimes they are justified.
   A higher minimum wage costs jobs, says the Minimum Wage
Coalition to Save Jobs, self-described as a ``broad-based
organization opposed to any increase in the federal minimum wage.''
It also generates inflation, the group says.
   One of the more disturbing contentions is that the minimum wage
is promoted as something it is not. It cannot improve the lot of
the poorest workers, it is said, because minimum-wage jobs often go
to higher-income families.
   According to this argument, many of the lowest paid positions
are occupied not by the unskilled but my secondary earners _ often
women and teen-agers _ whose incomes merely add to a household's
primary income.
   In retailing, says economist William Dunkelberg, 70 percent of
minimum-wage recipients are from families with incomes more than
200 percent above the poverty level. Low-income workers, he says,
make up 10 percent of the total.
   But, while the impact on the economy's direction might be almost
imperceptible, and the goal of helping the neediest might be
missed, the bills passed by the House and Senate might very well
have serious impact.
   Very small businesses are concerned because small increases can
represent a large percentage of earnings. Depressed economic areas,
where wages are lower than the minimum, would feel a greater impact
than would stronger regions. And businesses everywhere might find
more paperwork and compliance worries.
   But the impact on the economy as a whole isn't likely to be
impressive, and there might be no impact at all _ if President Bush
does indeed veto the matter before it is enacted.

   The jagged reef that ripped open the wandering
Exxon Valdez and dirtied Prince William Sound also reopened the
debate on requiring a second layer of steel as an added safety
factor on supertanker bottoms.
   ``This spill raises a red flag we may not have sufficiently
stringent design requirements,'' said Clifton Curtis, president of
the Oceanic Society, based in Washington, D.C.
   ``It's a world-class catastrophe, a benchmark for the worst-case
spill ever,'' Curtis said. ``It does call again for re-examination
of tanker design. There's lots of support to require double
bottoms.''
   A double bottom is a second skin covering a ship's underbelly.
It creates several feet of insurance space that must be penetrated
before cargo holds leak.
   But it would have also reduced the capacity of the Exxon Valdex
and added an extra 10-15 percent to the $125 million cost of the
tanker, launched with a single hull in 1986 in full compliance with
U.S. and international law.
   Industry analysts argue that double bottoms work if a ship runs
aground on a softer sandy bottom but are ineffective against
treacherous outcrops such as Bligh Reef. The extra bottom, when
breached, can also fill with seawater and cause a tanker to capsize
and break apart.
   ``Double bottoms are not the cure-all people think. It possibly
could lead to a worse spill,'' said Sean Connaughton of the
American Petroleum Institute.
   ``You can have the best designed ship, with the most modern
equipment and best trained crew in the world, and you can still
have accidents like this,'' he said. ``If you want to get rid of
the problem of oil tankers, don't ever use any oil.''
   The force of the Good Friday accident would not have kept the
Exxon Valdez from hemorrhaging oil even if it had a double bottom,
although some officials believe it could have curbed the amount of
goo lost.
   The ship, longer than three football fields, cruised through the
calm night on a routine run carrying 52 million gallons of oil. A
31,650-horsepower engine pushed it at 15 miles an hour.
   It had magnetic and gyroscopic compasses, an electronic
direction finder, two radar systems, a satellite navigation system
and two steering systems that work independently in case one fails
_ everything necessary to keep a proper course.
   But its captain, Joseph Hazelwood, who had lost his privilege to
drive cars on land because of two drunken driving convictions, had
too much liquor in his blood and was in his private cabin.
   In the hands of an unqualified third mate, the supertanker
strayed more than a mile out of shipping lanes and rammed an
undersea mountain.
   Holes as wide as 20 feet rent eight cargo holds. But even if a
double bottom were mandatory, the damage would have penetrated the
6 feet of space required for the Exxon Valdez, officials said.
   ``I don't think we could have designed any vessel to withstand
the kind of catastrophic damage this vessel was subjected to,''
said Cmdr. Mike Williams of the U.S. Coast Guard.
   ``We would have had pollution even if the vessel had a double
bottom,'' Williams said. ``Nothing we've ever done has taken human
error out of the loop.''
   In a touch of haunting irony, an Exxon official discussed human
error in George Sullivan's 1978 book ``Supertanker!,'' which
described the design and construction of the then-new and
astonishing megaships being built specifically for the oil trade.
   ``Accidents are the direct results of people on ships,'' William
O. Gray, a former senior adviser in Exxon's transportation
operations division, said in a chapter on accidents.
   In 1977, President Carter advocated double bottoms for
supertankers but was willing to accept alternative ways to limit
oil pollution.
   The next year, a compromise with international shippers kept the
extra bottom from becoming U.S. law. The Intergovernmental Marine
Organization, a U.N. agency based in London, adopted segregated
ballast as a safety feature that would reduce the incidence of oil
slicks.
   The ballast tanks, empty when a ship is fully loaded, carry
water when it is empty. This ended the practice of filling cargo
tanks with water for ballast and then flushing the gloppy residue
into the ocean. The segregated tanks, which are placed around a
tanker's sides, serve as cushions in case of collision.
   The side tanks were desired because accidents were 1.5 times
more likely to damage a ship's side than its bottom, according to
Coast Guard studies. Side damage came from collisions with other
ships, which often resulted in fires and explosions.
   What's more, a National Academy of Sciences study in 1973 said
80 percent of oil pollution came from operational practices such as
flushing tankers with sea water. Accidents made more headlines but
did only 20 percent of the environmental damage.
   The IMO requirements were contained in the U.S. Port and Tanker
Safety Act of 1978. So far, 55 countries representing 81 percent of
the world's merchant tonnage have complied.
   Worldwide, 3,200 oil tankers sail the oceans, bearing 24 million
barrels on any given day. Each of them is a potential disaster.
   The oil-thirsty United States, which has 200 commercial tankers,
imports 8 million barrels a day, about 80 percent of it by water.
Of the 72 U.S. flagships that have operated in Alaska, about 25
percent have double bottoms, the Coast Guard said.
   Before the Alaska pipeline was built to terminate in Valdez,
then-Secretary of Interior C.B. Rogers Morton promised Congress in
1972 that double bottoms would be a safety feature.
   ``Newly constructed American flag vessels carrying oil from Port
Valdez to U.S. ports will be required to have segregated ballast
systems, incorporating a double bottom,'' Morton said.
   The promise wasn't kept. But groups such as the Oceanic Society,
the Environmental Protection Institute and Friends of the Earth
hope the spill has the same impact on tanker regulations that Three
Mile Island had on the nuclear industry.
   In the wake of the spill, they favor double bottoms on all U.S.
tankers by the year 2000.
   Environmentalists also have an ally in Arthur McKenzie, director
of the Tanker Advisory Center in New York. He spent 11 of his 40
years as an Exxon Corp. employee on tankers.
   ``If a double bottom is strong enough, it may eliminate or
reduce a spill,'' McKenzie said. ``You can never stop catastrophes,
but you can minimize them.''

<HEAD>Japanese Women Break Precedent: They Go to Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reiko Sekiguchi, a 55-year-old college professor,
went to court when her employer ordered her to use her husband's
name.
   Just a few years ago in Japan that would have been unheard of.
   Women never went to court.
   ``My name is my right,'' said Ms. Sekiguchi, who has published
scholarly works under her maiden name for 20 years.
   Women increasingly are using the legal system to press for
changes in Japan's male-dominated society. Their demands include
the right to retain their maiden names, to receive joint property
and child support after divorce and to equal treatment in the work
place.
   By choosing the courts, they might change the way disputes are
settled in Japan.
   ``In general, lawsuits are increasing because everyone is
starting to think more about ways to improve their lives,'' said
Mizuho Fukushima, Ms. Sekiguchi's lawyer in the name case.
   ``More women are filing lawsuits than ever before. And with more
women working and more in executive positions, they will be able to
better afford the costs of lawsuits in the future.''
   A group of lawyers and professional women led by Ms. Fukushima
is lobbying the Justice Ministry and the Diet, Japan's parliament,
to change a law that requires married couples to take the last name
of one or the other spouse. More than 98 percent of wives take the
husband's name.
   Ms. Sekiguchi's suit, which is against the University of Library
and Information Science in Tsukuba, challenges that law.
   Ms. Fukushima expects it will take five to 10 years for the
lawsuit to proceed through the court system and for her group's
lobbying efforts to bear fruit.
   She pins more hope on the changing practices of some of Japan's
leading companies, which are starting to allow women to use their
maiden names.
   Women also are taking the lead in divorce cases. Until the early
1980s, most divorce actions were begun by men but in 1985, women
filed 74 percent of the divorce actions in the Tokyo Family Court.
   Middle-aged women, who have spent 15 or more years caring for
working husbands and raising children, have become the
fastest-growing group to initiate divorce actions.
   ``Because of the lack of closeness in their marriages, middle
age women have become emotionally independent,'' said Sumiko Iwao,
a psychologist at Tokyo's Keio University. ``But Japanese men are
emotionally dependent on women. They still believe that when they
retire they will be waited on by their wives as a reward.''
   Lawyer Kurumi Nakamura of Tokyo said, ``Lots of women wanted
divorces 10 years ago, too, but they thought they were supposed to
be patient about an unhappy marriage. Nowadays, they don't care
what other people think about divorce. It's more acceptable to
fight back.''
   Almost all divorces are resolved by agreement between the
spouses or through arbitration. Although 80 percent of women win
custody of their children, few get their share of either the
couple's property or child support.
   Almost 95 percent of separated, divorced or unmarried mothers
received no financial support from the husband or father of the
child, according to a survey in 1986 by the Tokyo Bureau of Social
Welfare.
   Ms. Nakamura conceded that despite stronger demands by her
clients for half of the couple's property at divorce, they rarely
get it. But property awards to women are gradually increasing.
   ``The tendency is for women to question what their rights are
and to examine how to attain happiness,'' Ms. Nakamura said. ``One
day it will seem very natural for them to go to court.''
   In another case, 33-year-old librarian Hisako Kawaguchi is suing
her employer for transferring her husband, who is employed by the
same company, to a city 170 miles away.
   In Japan, company transfers are common, and families are often
divided for years because of them.
   Mrs. Kawaguchi argues in her suit that the Teikoku Hormone
Manufacturing Co. violated a legal right for married couples to
live together and jointly care for their children.
   When Mrs. Kawaguchi told the company that her health would not
allow her to keep her job and care for her three children alone, it
replied that family circumstances were irrelevant, she said.
   Mrs. Kawaguchi told Kyodo News Service she believed the real
reason for the transfer was to force her to resign, since the
company preferred a younger woman for her job.

   Put some racy, glittery commercials with lots of
naked bodies on movie screens in France and the audience goes wild.
   But do the same thing in the United States _ with the glitz but
without the nudity _ and the ads go over as big as sticky floors,
stale popcorn and overpriced candy.
   Richard Dodderidge, senior vice president for corporate
marketing at AMC Entertainment in Kansas City, Mo., said when AMC
tried the ads in theaters, audiences went beserk.
   ``There was public displeasure indicated by throwing popcorn
boxes at the screen and people wanting their money back,'' he said.
``They left home to avoid commercial television. They paid money
and expected relief.''
   ``I've been in theaters where people booed,'' said Barbara
Lippert, advertising critic for Ad Week magazine. ``On paper they
sound great ... but they can only be successful if they're really
artfully done and surprising.''
   In France, audiences get about 30 minutes of commercials, which
must by law be 90 percent entertainment. In American theaters,
though, audiences who are often asked to pay as much as $10 a
ticket, resent the intrusion.
   The ads would have more staying power if they helped lower
ticket prices, said Ed Swanson, senior vice president of sales and
marketing for Modern Talking Picture Service in Chicago, which
distributes corporate-sponsored films. He recalled a recent movie
outing with his family in which he paid $22 for four tickets _
after a $50 dinner check. ``If I'd have sat there and seen a
commercial I'd have been peeved.''
   ``Nobody likes commercials,'' said Terry Laughren, president of
Screenvision Cinema Network, a New York-based company that
distributes commercials. ``But there's a tremendous fascination in
this country for good advertising.''
   The clutter of commercials on television has been one force
behind the advertisers' quest for a more captive audience. Toyota
Motor Corp., General Motors Corp., 7-Up, Dr Pepper, Lee jeans,
Pepsi Co., Memorex and the U.S. Marines, have reeled out dollars to
give movie advertising a try.
   ``It seems to be growing pretty steadily,'' said Larissa
Alexandra, vice president of Screenvision in Los Angeles. ``With
TV, what you are trying to do is talk through clutter to get some
attention. There's no chance to get the emotional aspects of the
product.''
   Creators insist the ads are distinctly different from typical TV
commercials, and some of them can be edited for television.
   Dave Danzer, national advertising manager for Toyota, said the
directors hired to do the ads often have experience with feature
films and stunts such as car chases. He refused to divulge how much
Toyota spends on theater ads.
   One of Screenvision's most recent commercials features Toyota.
   ``It is hard to find anybody who reacts negatively,'' said
Laughren about the ad. ``To the concept, yes, there is negative
reaction, but then they say, `Oh god! That was a great
commercial.'''
   In the Toyota ad, which Danzer likens to the adventure formula
of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' a man dreams he's being chased
through a jungle in his Toyota four-wheeler by an imaginary threat.
There's no dialogue until he wakes up, looks out his window and
sees his Toyota sitting outside. Then an announcer says: ``Toyota's
new V64X4. Get it ... before it gets you.''
   Danzer didn't know if the ads helped sales, but he said they
were especially good at reaching males 18 to 34 years old, who are
typically light TV viewers.
   ``In the theater 95 percent of the people see your ad,'' Danzer
said. ``They might be eating popcorn, but they see the ad. With
television you have no idea whether they are going to look at it.''
   Michael Bernacchi, a professor of marketing at the University of
Detroit, has studied theater advertising and thinks companies
increasingly will want to see their products featured on the big
screen.
   ``Right now it's an outstanding way to communicate with
consumers,'' he said. ``Viewers will tend to ... receive them with
more interest and maybe chagrin. They may reject them in their
hearts, but they are probably going to stay in the saddle and
witness them.''
   The reason is a moviegoer's state of mind. Bernacchi said the
expectation is much different when people actually seek
entertainment.
   ``Few people go to the movies with the idea of just sitting and
casually attending. You go there with a purpose,'' he said.
   Bernacchi thinks the ads will thrive because in theaters there
is much less competition for a viewer's attention, and because the
cinema, unlike VCRs, don't offer the option of hand-held controls.
   However, some theater chain executives are less optimistic. They
say reaction from audiences has been so overwhelmingly negative
they risked losing business if they didn't pull the ads.
   ``We've tried it from time to time in different parts of the
country,'' said Russ Duncan, Chicago regional manager for General
Cinema. ``The company felt the good will between the patrons and
the company was somewhat compromised, and we valued the good will
of the patrons more than running the ads.''
   Duncan and Dodderidge said they weren't aware of any plans by
their respective companies to try the ads again, but that's not to
say their theaters are without commercials. Both General Cinema and
AMC feature ads on slides.
   ``The slides are very low key,'' said Neil Katcher, Detroit
district manager for AMC. ``You don't have to watch them if you
don't want to. Nobody complains about them.''

<DATELINE>ON THE SEA OF GALILEE, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S.-Iraeli team with
remote-controlled yellow submarines the size of sea turtles is
searching the bottom of the Sea of Galilee for underwater salt
wells.
   But they also have taken the time to look for remnants of a
battle between Jews and Romans in 67 A.D. when 6,700 Jews were
believed to have been killed.
   The submarines were brought to Israel by U.S. marine scientists.
   ``It's the first time we can see for ourselves what the bottom
of the lake looks like,'' said Tom Berman, director of the Kinneret
Laboratory for Limnology on Galilee's northern shore. Kinneret is
the Hebrew name for the Sea of Galilee.
   Project director Richard Cooper, a marine scientist from the
University of Connecticut, said submarines are superior to divers
because they go as deep as 1,000 feet and, more importanly in this
case, can stay under water for as long as 10 hours.
   One recent day aboard the project's control boat, anchored a
little over a mile offshore, Cooper lowered one submarine, equipped
with a TV camera, still camera and strobe light, into the lake to
look for salt water craters.
   Geologists, biologists and marine scientists gathered around a
small monitor on deck to analyze the TV camera's pictures from the
rocky bed of the lake which about 140 feet at its deepest point.
   The 64-square-mile Sea of Galilee is about 700 feet below sea
level and is Israel's major source of fresh water, providing nearly
one-third of the nation's supply.
   Salt levels are now at an acceptable level but might increase if
water levels drop because of scant rainfall, Berman said.
   Data collected by the submarines could help scientists lower the
lake's salt levels by determining what activates the salt wells.
   ``Nobody understands the mechanisms whereby these salt sources
begin to flow,'' Berman said.
   Scientists also got a closer look at a three-foot-high ridge on
the lake's bottom, indicating recent earthquake activity. The Sea
of Galilee is part of an active rift valley extending from the
Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea to the Red Sea in the south.
   The 15-member crew of the control boat spent one day during the
two-week project looking for what they might find from the lake
battle in 67 A.D., said Shelley Wachsmann, inspector for underwater
antiquities in the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums.
   The battle took place during the Roman conquest of Galilee. When
the Romans overran the town of Migdal on the western shore of the
lake, Jews fled in boats. The Romans pursued them in hastily
constructed rafts and killed about 6,700 in the battle.
   ``One could see the whole lake stained with blood and crammed
with corpses, for not one man escaped,'' wrote the Jewish historian
and soldier Flavius Josephus who took part in the battle.
   Wachsmann said the submarines probed several areas in the
northern part of the lake where initial research indicated boats
from the battle might have sunk.
   The submarines came up with nothing, but Wachsmann said they
would be useful tools in future research.
   The submarine project is part of a U.S. National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration long-term study comparing large lakes
around the world, including Lake Victoria and Lake Malawi in Africa
and the Great Lakes in the United States.
   The submarines are going back to the United States when the
project ends, but the scientists will return next year for further
studies, Berman said.

<HEAD>Corporations Lobbying for Sweeping Changes in Education</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 5th graf to include full name of Georgia Alliance for Public
Education, ``They include xxx''.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporations from Florida to California are
plunging into the political arena to lobby for sweeping changes in
public education _ and sometimes even the tax increases to pay for
them.
   The feel-good era is over, say those leading the charge. It is
no longer enough to pledge jobs, hold career days, provide mentors
or adopt a school.
   ``We've learned to say no ... to the altruistic warm fuzzy
stuff. We're not going to do that,'' says John Cairns, a lawyer and
former director of the Minnesota Business Partnership Inc. ``It
doesn't accomplish enough. It doesn't represent enough change in
the system. It doesn't return enough on the investment we're being
asked to make.''
   The new types of activism range from Cairns' Minnesota
coalition, which helped push through the state legislature a
pioneering statewide ``choice'' program giving parents a say in
where their children attend school, to a Chicago business group
instrumental in winning state legislative approval for radical
changes in their city's school system.
   They include business campaigns for education tax increases and
bond issues in New Orleans, Cincinnati, Miami, South Carolina and
California, and a successful drive to remove school board members
in Detroit. There's also the Georgia Alliance for Public Education,
which is convening 200 CEOs from around the state in June to talk
about education and business and politics, and the Boston Compact,
which started by offering job placements in exchange for school
improvements but has evolved into a citywide restructuring plan.
   ``There certainly are more and more examples of the business
community getting involved in some of the tougher political issues
confronting schools,'' says Michael Usdan, president of the
private, non-profit Institute for Educational Leadership, which is
examining trends in the relationship between education and business.
   ``There's a tendency now to move into the political arena, away
from ... the tiny programs that collectively may not have meant
much at a time when the whole enterprise was facing such terrible,
terrible problems,'' Usdan said.
   Personalized corporate involvement in schools became highly
visible in 1981 when New York philanthropist Eugene Lang
``adopted'' a class of sixth-graders at his alma mater, promising
them counseling, support and college scholarships if they went on
to graduate.
   Another boost came in 1983 after the release of ``A Nation at
Risk,'' the gloomy report that detailed profound shortcomings in
U.S. education.
   From 1983 to 1987, the Education Department reports, the number
of education partnerships in public schools rocketed from 42,200 to
140,800 _ more than half of them sponsored by businesses.
   But the department also found that the most frequent types of
support provided by education partnerships were special awards,
scholarships or incentives for students, and guest speakers,
special demonstrations or use of the partner's facilities or
equipment. The offerings suggest some of the limitations inherent
in the approach.
   Some of those involved with adopt-a-school programs speak
bluntly about the problems.
   Some corporations may consider this ``the least expensive way to
satisfy their obligation... It's far more difficult to run a
complex jobs placement program where there are quid pro quos with
the school system,'' says Gene Cartwright, community affairs
manager for the Amoco Corp., which was heavily involved in this
year's successful drive to revamp Chicago's schools.
   Cartwright and others also noted that adopting schools, the most
popular form of partnership, often means adopting survivors _ not
those students most at risk.
   ``Basically, most of the businesses don't want to deal with the
more difficult students,'' says Sandra Hamburg of the Committee for
Economic Development, a group of business executives and educators
that has issued influential reports on the need to invest in
disadvantaged children. ``They only want the best students to come
in to their business for a career day program or they don't want to
deal with pairing a company employee with someone who's not really
motivated.''
   The National Alliance of Business, a non-profit group financed
half by the federal government and half by the private sector, has
undertaken a major effort to widen and deepen business impact by
sponsoring programs modeled on the Boston Compact in 12 cities
across the country. The premise is that local businesses pledge
jobs to high school graduates in exchange for school improvements
such as a reduction in the dropout rate.
   However, the Boston Compact achieved mixed results in its first
five years and a private evaluation of the first 18 months of the
NAB project in seven cities found the same uneven pattern.
   ``The best evidence we have points to the usefulness of these
(compacts) in the areas of targeted jobs, scholarships and
modestly-scaled collaborative programming for at-risk youth,''
wrote Gary Walker of Public-Private Ventures, the Philadelphia firm
that did the February 1989 evaluation.
   ``The elusive element of these systemwide collaborations,
however, continues to be the very thing that underlies their
origination and continuing popularity: `school improvement,'''
Walker wrote. ``School-business compacts may be no more than one
important piece of a much larger puzzle.''
   That view came through strongly at an NAB conference last week
among business officials involved in the political arena.
Cartwright called compacts ``a natural and reasonable entry point
for business to interact with the schools'' but added, ``Don't
assume that they alone will remodel the infrastructure of a failing
school system.''
   Cartwright and Cairns, participants in a panel on state action,
contended that businesses can significantly influence education
only by becoming active in the state legislative process because
most education funds come from states.
   ``If you're not a player with the state on many of these
programs, you're really not playing where most of the decisions are
made,'' Cairns said.
   Some supporters of the compact concept disagreed. ``A lot of
change in large city systems is going to happen in cities
themselves,'' said Jim Vollman, executive director of the Detroit
Compact. ``They are managed by local elected boards and if they
don't buy it, it's not going to happen. You can't expect the state
to do it.''
   But even the compacts are finding they must get involved in
politics _ school board or city council _ to win real change. In
Boston, for example, businesses were highly successful at placing
high school graduates in jobs but test scores improved only
slightly and dropout rates proved intransigent. In the compact's
second phase, business leaders are working with the mayor, elected
education officials and teacher unions to achieve specific reforms:
school-based management and a school ``choice'' program.
   The common ground among forward-thinking business leaders is
that whether their playing field is a city, a state or a district,
they must move beyond a one-school approach.
   ``Adopt-a-school served a very important historical role ...,''
says Eve Hoffman, president of the Georgia Alliance, a non-profit
group formed to educate and activate the business community on
education issues. ``There are a lot of people who have a lot
invested in adopt-a-school and what we have to do is encourage
these people to look beyond that at bigger issues.''

   Many Japanese workers transferring to
their companies' U.S. branches have a problem: American schools
don't prepare their children for the tough competition to get into
a Japanese university.
   Japan's solution _ and a testament to the growing Japanese
presence in this country _ is Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School,
which will be the first fully accredited Japanese high school in
America when it opens May 10.
   ``Our goal is to give education to the children of overseas
assigned business people,'' though the first class of 25 includes
only one student whose family lives in the United States, said
director Hiroshi Jo.
   ``Although we said it will be for American-based people, it will
be two to four years before we have enough enrollment to operate
that way,'' Jo said. He said families in Japan may have been more
familiar with the parent school, Meiji Gakuin University, than
workers already in the United States.
   ``Nothing is more important to Japanese families than the
education of their children,'' said former Gov. Lamar Alexander,
president of the University of Tennessee and scheduled keynote
speaker for the opening. ``College entrance is very competitive and
determined almost exclusively by results.
   ``If they fall behind while they're in the U.S., that is a very
dramatic problem for a Japanese family.''
   Owned and operated by the Tokyo university with the support of
Japan's Ministry of Education, the coed school will open with
grades 10, 11 and 12 on the Japanese school year, April through
March with 250 days of class.
   School was to start Saturday, but students and teachers ran into
problems getting visas, Jo said. ``I think maybe because this is
the first Japanese high school, (immigration officials) are
carefully handling reviewing this matter.''
   Sending a student to TMG, as it's called, will cost about
$19,000 a year.
   ``It may be more expensive than some can afford, but many send
kids to colleges that are quite expensive,'' Jo said. ``I also
think some companies will begin to subsidize overseas education.
That need is more and more confirmed by both the people of Japan
and the government.''
   The academic life will be pretty restrictive, he said. ``They
will have to check out of the dorms if they want to leave. And they
will have a lot of study requirements that will take a lot of their
time.''
   But the students, expected to number around 200 within two
years, will be encouraged to take advantage of being in another
country. They will go to class six days a week, as in Japan, but
the sixth day will be for outside activities.
   ``The students will certainly have a lot of contact with the
community,'' Jo said. ``The students can do regular high school
studies, plus have such a valuable experience as living in this
country.''
   For Sweetwater, a town of 5,310 between Knoxville and
Chattanooga, it could be sort of a stay-at-home cultural exchange
program.
   ``It will be a culture shock both ways, for the Japanese coming
here and for the community. Their philosophies of education and
living are different, so I think it will be an educational
experience for all of us,'' said Sweetwater Chamber of Commerce
President Charles Chamberlain.
   Meiji Gakuin paid $2.4 million for 144 rolling acres and 13
buildings, including two gymnasiums, a library and three
dormitories that can house a total of 220 students. It spent $1.5
million on renovation.
   TMG recruited in Japan and hired 12 teachers, four of whom _ two
single people and a married couple _ will live on campus. The
teachers will be paid what their counterparts in Japan are paid.
``There were many applications for every subject,'' Jo said.
   Alexander, who as governor from 1979-1987 heavily recruited
Japanese businesses, said the school ``could be a magnet for
industry, and I think it will be a wonderful thing for our own
educational system because it will give us a basis for comparison.
I think it's healthy to have. It means we don't have to go half way
around the world to discover what the competition is doing.''
   There are 71 Japanese-owned businesses in Tennessee employing
12,600. The largest is the Nissan truck plant in Smyrna. Others
include ACOM, which makes Panasonic electric components in
Knoxville; Sharp; Matsushita; and Komatsu.
   TMG will employ 12 people from Sweetwater and the surrounding
area, eight of them full-time _ including two cooks.
   ``They are in America,'' Jo said, ``So they should eat some
American food. Spaghetti. Cheeseburgers.''

   Question: How do you contain 10 million gallons of oil?
   Answer: You keep it in a tanker.
   _ A joke making the rounds in Valdez.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By FRED BAYLES</NOTE>
<NOTE>AP National Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the three weeks since the nation's
biggest oil spill gushed from the hull of the Exxon Valdez,
millions of dollars, thousands of manhours and tons of the most
advanced equipment have been marshaled against the black tide in
Prince William Sound.
   Dozens of skimming vessels, more than a million feet of
containment boom and uncounted quantities of oil suckers, soakers
and squeegees have been committed to the fight.
   But despite the money, manpower and machines, the effort has
scarcely dented the spill and the damage it has wrought. By Friday,
Exxon estimated it had recovered only about 20,000 of the 240,000
barrels spilled.
   While plenty of blame can be shared among Exxon and government
officials for the accident and the chaos that followed, those
familiar with the science of oil spills say the enormity of 10
million gallons of crude unleashed on the vast Alaskan wilderness
overpowered the available technology.
   ``Imagine the spill is the size of Madison Square Garden,'' said
Todd Nelson, a Coast Guard petty officer who specializes in oil
spills. ``Throw a Band-Aid on it and that's all your containment
boom. Throw a paperclip on it and that's all your skimming
capacity. The dimensions are mind-boggling.''
   The first line of defense in an oil spill is the containment
boom, a cylindrical, inflated float up to 4 feet in diameter that
can have an attached skirt extending several feet under water.
Anchors or boats hold the boom in place.
   The 11-hour delay in getting booms around the stricken tanker
doomed chances of controlling the spill, which eventually scattered
over hundreds of square miles of islands, inlets and bays by wind
and waves.
   ``It's like trying to get the toothpaste back into the tube,''
said Nelson.
   The next method considered was chemical dispersants. Sprayed
from the air, dispersants break up the molecular bond of oil much
the way kitchen detergent scatters the grease in a sinkful of dirty
dishes. The tiny droplets sink to the bottom where critics say the
oil particles will contaminate the environment for years.
   But the use of dispersants has been opposed by biologists who
fear their toxicity, and there is also doubt about their success.
They must be applied under ideal conditions of moderate wave
action, and they won't work if sprayed too fine or too thick.
   ``There have been many dispersant applications that have been
inconclusive and a lot that just didn't work,'' said John Robinson,
chief of the hazardous materials response branch of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   But there was never a chance to use them here. Exxon had only
3,000 gallons of chemical on hand at the time of the spill, and it
would have taken 500,000 gallons to do the job. In addition, seas
were either too calm or too rough in the days following the wreck.
   The next possibility was to recover the oil, a process involving
a wide range of options from huge vessels to high-tech mops.
   The workhorse of the task is the oil skimmer, an open-mouthed
boat or barge that sluices oil up a conveyer belt where it is then
scraped or vacuumed into a holding tank.
   Also in the arsenal are ``super suckers,'' trucks on floating
barges that gulp oil off the surface. A variety of materials can
also sponge oil from the water.
   In the Exxon Valdez spill, the skimming operations were slow to
start and have been frustratingly small in impact. Almost twice as
much oil has disappeared through evaporation as has been picked up.
   Whatever success the recovery operation enjoyed is being
credited to local fishermen who encircled the oil with booms in
much the same way they use nets to trap herring and salmon.
   Experts say the continued snail's pace of recovery is to be
expected. Few skimmers can gather more than 40 barrels of oil over
a few hours. The near-freezing temperature of water in the sound
turns the oil into a squishy, pudding-like consistency hard to
collect. Once the skimmers are full, the oily water in their holds
must be pumped into a barge or floating tanks.
   While the skimmers have struggled to collect a thousand barrels
a day, much more of the slick has been broken up by wind and wave
action.
   ``Skimmers are a very inefficient method of recovering the oil.
They take in a lot of water with the oil,'' said John Whitney, a
science support coordinator for NOAA. ``It's a very slow process,
while nature works very strongly.''
   The final battle against the spill is being fought on the island
shorelines. Crews are trying to remove the oil from the shore,
often wiping or scraping it off, rock by rock, a process known
derisively as ``rock waxing.''
   The process requires lots of people with lots of time. Other
solutions, like the use of high-pressure hoses spewing hot water,
have been turned down as too harmful to the ecosystems on the
beaches.
   ``We've seen from other spills that if we hit it too hard, with
things like steam cleaning, we'll kill everything there,'' said
Robinson.
   Ed Owens, an Exxon consultant on shoreline cleaning, said
workers will be washing down the beaches with sea water from
low-pressure hoses.
   ``The water washes the oil and carries it into the water where
it is contained and then removed,'' he said. ``It is the least
damaging ecologically.''
   While the weeks following the Exxon Valdez accident were marked
by mistakes and technical problems, oil spill experts says it is
simply a very tough job to contain and recover millions of gallons
of oil from the water.
   ``The situation here we've seen here is not atypical,'' Robinson
said. ``But it doesn't relieve anybody of the responsibility of
trying to get it done.''

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of major developments in the investigation
of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its high-yield bond trader
Michael R. Milken:
   May 12, 1986 _ The Securities and Exchange Commission charges
Dennis Levine of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. with making $12.6
million in profits from illegal trading on inside information since
1980.
   June 5 _ Levine pleads guilty to four felonies, agrees to
cooperate with the government's investigation and surrenders $11.6
million in illicit profits and restitution.
   Nov. 14 _ Stock speculator Ivan Boesky agrees to pay a $100
million penalty to settle charges of trading on insider information
supplied by Levine in 1985 and 1986. He also agrees to cooperate
with investigators in a much broader investigation of Drexel and
its chief financier, Michael Milken.
   Feb. 20 _ Levine is sentenced to two years in prison and fined
$362,000 on charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   March 19 _ Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of the Los Angeles
securities firm Jefferies &amp; Co., pleads guilty to two violations of
securities laws in exchange for cooperating in the government's
investigation. He quits the brokerage and agrees to stay out of the
securities business or at least five years.
   April 23 _ Boesky pleads guilty to a single charge of conspiracy
to lie to the SEC, punishable by five years imprisonment and a
$250,000 fine.
   Dec. 18 _ Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term and no
fine.
   March 24, 1988 _ Boesky begins serving his sentence at a
minimum-security facility in Lompoc, Calif.
   Aug. 4 _ A grand jury indicts five partners in the investment
concern Princeton-Newport Partners and a former Drexel trader over
an alleged multimillion dollar fraud and racketeering scheme, the
first-ever racketeering charge against securities professionals.
Defendants deny wrongdoing and their attorneys call the indictment
a pressure tactic to force their cooperation in a much larger
investigation of Drexel and Milken.
   Sept. 7 _ The SEC accuses Drexel, Milken and three other
employees of violating a wide range of securities laws, most in
connection with Boesky. Drexel and the others deny the accusations.
   Nov. 30 _ Intense secret negotiations are reported between
Drexel and federal prosecutors in a last-ditch attempt by the firm
to avert an indictment, particularly racketeering charges, which
carry enormous penalties.
   Dec. 7 _ Princeton-Newport Partners liquidates because of what
defense lawyers call brutal government misuse of the racketeering
laws to coerce their clients into cooperating in the Drexel
investigation.
   Dec. 21 _ Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud probe in history. Under the settlement,
Drexel must also settle the related SEC litigation and cooperate in
the government's pursuit of other alleged wrongdoers.
   Jan. 25, 1989 _ The government files formal charges against
Drexel, publicly detailing for the first time the accusations to
which it will plead guilty. Most are related to the firm's alleged
relationship with Boesky.
   Feb. 10 _ Milken asks a federal judge to reject or modify the
plea agreement on the grounds it violates his rights by forcing
Drexel to fire him and withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay.
Milken charges Drexel was coerced into signing the pact because of
the threat of racketeering charges.
   March 22 _ Drexel assistant bond trader Lisa Jones is convicted
of lying to a federal grand jury during an investigation into stock
parking allegations between Drexel and Princeton-Newport Partners.
The perjury conviction is the first in the government's
investigation of Drexel.
   March 29 _ A federal grand jury indicts Milken, his brother
Lowell Milken and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg on 98 counts
of racketeering and fraud. Potential penalties and fines under the
counts amount to more than $12 billion plus possible prison terms.
   April 7 _ Michael and Lowell Milken plead innocent to all
charges at a federal court arraignment.
   April 13 _ Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud cause that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Michael Milken. Drexel also
announces that former SEC chief John Shad _ who was instrumental in
starting the investigation that led to the fraud charges _ would
become its chairman.

   Here are key terms of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s settlement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Thursday.
   _As previously announced, Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six
felony counts of securities fraud and payment of $650 million in
civil and criminal penalties and restitution to civil claimants.
   _Drexel agrees to a permanent injunction against future
violations of securities laws. If Drexel violates the injunction,
the SEC can resume proceedings that could result in Drexel's losing
its broker-dealer status.
   _Drexel agrees to ``disassociate'' junk bond chief Michael
Milken from its business. It must fire or place on a leave of
absence any other employee who is indicted.
   _Drexel agrees to buy back Michael Milken's shares in the
company and, if his brother Lowell Milken is no longer employed by
Drexel, to purchase his shares as well.
   _Drexel agrees to appoint three independent directors to its
board, including a new chairman of Drexel's holding company. The
three directors will oversee internal controls and audit,
accounting and compliance and serve as a disciplinary committee.
   The new chairman will be John S.R. Shad, former chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The other two outside directors
will be Rod Hills, also a former chairman of SEC and the husband of
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, and Ralph Saul, former head
of the American Stock Exchange.
   _Drexel also agrees to pick people approved by the SEC for four
other top posts: general counsel, director of compliance, a senior
trading official who will review trades for three years, and a
member of Drexel's executive committee who will live in the Los
Angeles area and oversee Drexel's Beverly Hills office.
   Saul Cohen has already been approved as general counsel. He
previously was a partner with the law firm of Rosenman &amp; Colin.
   _Drexel will move its stock and convertible securities trading
operations from Beverly Hills, Calif., to New York.
   _Drexel will be allowed to keep its high-yield junk bond
operations in Beverly Hills, but it will be under the oversight of
the SEC-approved executive committee member.
   _Drexel agrees to cooperate with the government's continuing
investigation retroactive to 1978 and extending for three years
after completion of the settlement.
   _Drexel agrees to pay $15 million in civil penalties,
representing three times the profits gained or losses avoided in
dealings in several stocks. The $15 million is part of the $650
million in fines and restitution that Drexel had previously agreed
to pay.
   _Drexel agrees to name at least three compliance officers in the
offices of the junk bond department. At least two must be persons
who have not previously worked in the junk bond department. The
compliance officers will have the authority to cancel or revoke
securities transactions.
   _The law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, selected by the SEC,
will review and report on Drexel's policies, procedures and
practices and recommend changes.
   _Drexel agrees to pay for an accountant, Peat Marwick Main &amp;
Co., which has been picked by the U.S. attorney's office, to review
Drexel's records.
   _Drexel agrees to hire a ``special reviewer'' acceptable to the
SEC to review its investment company operations.
   _Drexel agrees to hire an outsider with SEC approval to serve as
ombudsman. The ombudsman, William Hughes Mulligan, a former federal
appeals court judge, will report to the oversight committee and
will have the authority to conduct independent investigations.
   _Drexel agrees to either terminate or place on leave anybody who
is currently named or who may be named in an indictment within the
next five years in SEC civil actions alleging security fraud
violations concerning junk bond operations.
   _To prevent conflicts of interest, Drexel agrees to create a
capital markets services department in Beverly Hills that will be
in charge of pricing and selling new junk bond securities.
   _New public issues of debt securities may not be purchased by
employees or employee-related accounts. Drexel employees would also
be prohibited from acquiring stock or warrants of an issuer for
which Drexel has written or privately placed securities within the
preceding six months.
   _The agreement is to become final after Drexel enters formal
pleas to the six felony counts to which it agreed to plead guilty
in its plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
   _Separately, the SEC announced a settlement with Cary Maultasch,
a former Drexel employee who was named in last year's complaint.

   Can a romance magazine publisher find happiness
cranking out a weekly supermarket tabloid full of celebrities and
gossip?
   National Enquirer readers may soon find out.
   Macfadden Holdings Inc., whose titles include True Story, True
Confessions and Modern Romance, said Thursday it has agreed to pay
$412.5 million for the company that publishes the National
Enquirer, the saucy scandal sheet put on the auction block nearly
four months ago.
   Macfadden said it had formed a partnership that made the winning
bid for GP Group Inc., which publishes the Enquirer from Lantana,
Fla.
   The definitive sales agreement caps an auction process launched
in mid-December after the October death of Generoso Pope Jr., who
owned GP Group.
   Macfadden officials said the deal could be completed in May.
   ``It sounds like a good solid price,'' said John Reidy, a media
industry analyst for the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   But he noted there was little financial information available
publicly about either GP Group or Macfadden because they are both
privately held.
   Some of the biggest names in the media business, including
British publisher Robert Maxwell, France's Hachette SA and West
German publisher Heinrich Bauer, were reportedly among the bidders
at one time or another.
   Reidy said he suspected, however, that Macfadden felt its
properties could benefit from a link to the Enquirer's supermarket
distribution system.
   In a statement announcing the agreement late Thursday, Macfadden
said it had formed a partnership to make the bid with media
investment fund Boston Ventures Limited Partnerhip III, which is
financing the purchase.
   Macfadden will have responsibility for operating GP Group's
holdings, which include the Enquirer's sister publication, Weekly
World News.
   The National Enquirer has an average paid circulation of about
4.3 million per week while the circulation of Weekly World News is
about 1 million.
   The two publications offer considerable advertising power and an
attractive franchise in the supermarket checkout lanes.
   ``We are delighted we are the successful bidder for the GP
Group,'' said Peter Callahan, chairman of Macfadden.
   ``We have great respect for all of the employees who have helped
build the company. We are enthusiastic about the company's
management and its prospects,'' he said.
   Iain Calder, chairman and president of GP Group, said, ``The
entire GP Group family welcomes this opportunity we will have with
the new owners and are pleased with their commitment to us and
their desire to continue to build and grow the company.''
   The Blackstone Group, a private New York investment bank, was
retained last December to conduct the auction. One of Blackstone's
partners, Peter G. Peterson, was one of three trustees for Pope's
estate.
   Peterson could not be reached for comment, and the firm declined
to comment on how many bidders actually participated.
   But it was understood that the auction was conducted in two
phases, with the first cut in potential candidates coming about two
months ago. The deadline for final bids was Wednesday, and the
decision on a winner was completed Thursday.
   Michael Boylan, Macfadden's president, said he and Callahan met
with GP Group employees Thursday in Florida and told them they
considered the employees as among the most valued assets of the
company.
   He said that while there may be some changes in how the
publications are marketed, the prospective new owners don't plan to
change their operations. GP Group's headquarters will remain in
Lantana, he said.
   Macfadden was founded in 1975 when Callahan acquired several
unprofitable romance publications for an investment of $800.
   Today, Macfadden publishes a group of seven romance magazines
with a combined monthly circulation of about 2 million, led by True
Story at 1.3 million, Boylan said.
   In addition, Macfadden publishes Teen Beat magazine with a
circulation of 250,000 a month, and two special interest magazines,
The Discount Merchandiser and Chief Executive.

<HEAD>Race For Cold Cash From Cold Fusion Leaves Some Scholars Cold</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Traditional academic openness is going by the
boards in the race to understand cold nuclear fusion as scholars
withhold findings that could make them big money.
   A broad patent on cold nuclear fusion could be worth billions of
dollars if the invention turns out to provide a new way of
producing cheap, clean and abundant energy.
   But the lure of money is inhibiting exploration of cold fusion
claims by making researchers withhold information to protect their
patent positions, lawyers and scholars said Thursday.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that once you dangle
out that pot of gold called a patent it causes people to publish
less and disclose less,'' said Donald Chisum, a patent expert at
the University of Washington.
   Scientists trying to test the cold fusion claims announced at a
press conference last month have been stymied because the two
researchers have withheld important details of their work.
   The University of Utah applied for three patents even before the
March 23 news conference featuring its own B. Stanley Pons and his
co-investigator, Martin Fleischmann of the University of
Southampton in England.
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology said this week it has
applied for patents on work done by a researcher named Peter
Hagelstein.
   Brigham Young University plans to apply for patents as well,
although mainly to establish the credibility of its researcher,
Steven Jones, rather than to make money, spokesman Paul Richards
said.
   Pons and Fleischmann announced they had achieved fusion using
ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature _ so-called cold
fusion. They said their device produced four watts of energy for
every watt it used.
   Previously, it was believed that fusion would have to take place
at extremely high temperatures. The announcement stunned scientists
worldwide who had worked for years to achieve fusion.
   Widespread skepticism about their findings has continued despite
partial confirmation by other researchers. Still, the stakes are so
high that virtually every major chemical research laboratory is
believed to be looking into it.
   ``It's almost unknowable, unthinkable how much it would be
worth,'' said John Bockris, a chemistry professor at Texas A&amp;M.
   Bockris also said he was upset by the way the focus on patents
had disrupted the normal scientific disclosure process.
   Patent lawyers usually advise clients to file for patents before
they disclose anything publicly. Secrecy helps even after a patent
application is filed, because it gives the inventors time to modify
their application with new findings or to file for more patents.
   ``The more information you give out, the more can be used
against you,'' Chisum said. ``From a patent law perspective,
publication is bad.''
   Richards, the Brigham Young spokesman, said the school applied
for patents mainly so the Patent and Trademark Office has a chance
to sort out what he called false allegations that its Steven Jones
stole Fleischmann's and Pons' work. Richards said Brigham Young did
not believe cold fusion was likely to be very valuable commercially.
   Richards claimed that University of Utah officials held their
March 23 news conference despite an agreement with Brigham Young
officials that the schools would keep quiet about their work until
March 24, the day they had agreed to ship back-to-back papers on
cold fusion to the British journal Nature.
   Richards and several patent lawyers said the University of
Utah's unusual press conference appeared to be more of a grab for
publicity than anything.
   ``I think they just naively thought they could pull this off,
and go down in history as the first ones to have done this,''
Richards said.
   James Brophy, the University of Utah's director of research,
said the school held the news conference because there had been
leaks and ``I was concerned and others were concerned that the
story would get out in an uncontrolled fashion.''
   Any royalties from Utah's patents will be split evenly three
ways between Fleischmann and Pons, the chemistry department, and
the university as a whole. That is the usual procedure, Brophy said.
   The concern for profit on campus accelerated in the 1970s with
biotechnology, which made a fast transition from pure research to
product. Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley earn millions of dollars a year on the so-called
Cohen-Boyers atent on gene-splicing techniques.
   The revolution in high-temperature superconductivity dragged
universities even closer to the commercial sphere.
Superconductivity is the ability to transmit electricity through a
substance without any loss of power, or resistance.
   Last year, for example, Du Pont Co. paid $1.5 million to the
University of Houston for exclusive rights to Paul Chu's
superconductivity patent applications.

<HEAD>Eds: UDPATES with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar slipped against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also were
lower in morning trading.
   The dollar, which opened at 132.00 yen, down 0.80 yen from
Thursday's close, rose slightly to 132.30 yen by late morinig. It
moved in the range of 131.92 to 132.37 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 192.51-point
loser Thursday, shed another 138.67 points, or 0.42 percent, to
finish the morning session at 32,925.27.
   The decline was precipitated by a retreat in New York linked to
the dollar's weakness in currency markets, said Yoshiro Inouye, an
analyst with Nomura Securities.
   ``But participants were inclined to remain on the sidelines
today, due to concerns over the release of U.S. economic indicators
(later Friday)'' he said.
   The United States was to announce major economic figures,
including the nation's trade figures for February and wholesale
prices for March.
   Japanese stock investors expect the U.S. trade deficit to widen
to around $9.9 billion from $9.5 billion in January, Inouye said,
   Political uncertainty over a widening stock profiteering and
bribery scandal here has chronically discouraged trading, he added.
   In the currency market, traders said the dollar fell after
slipping in New York to 132.06 yen, down 0.99 yen from its 133.05
yen close Wednesday.
   The U.S. currency weakened following a rise in Swiss interest
rates and the appointment of a new West German finance minister,
the traders said.
   Nervousness over U.S. trade figures was also discouraged trading
in the foreign exchange market, a dealer at a Japanese commercial
bank said on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Burlington Resources To Spin Off Plum Creek Timber Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington Resources Inc., which itself was spun
off from Burlington Northern Inc. last year, said Thursday it
intends to divest its timber and wood products operation, Plum
Creek Timber Co.
   Burlington Resources said Plum Creek Timber Co. L.P., a master
limited partnership, had registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering, with proceeds
to be used to acquire and run Plum Creek.
   Plum Creek has approximately 1.4 million acres of timberland and
about 9.6 billion board feet of salable softwood timber in the
Pacific Northwest. It employs about 1,800 people in Washington,
Idaho and Montana, and in 1988 had a profit of $57.4 million on
revenues of $332.8 million.
   Burlington Resources said the current management of Plum Creek
would remain in place and that no changes in employment levels
would result from the establishment of the partnership.
   In its registration statement with the SEC, the partnership
seeks an initial public offering of 12.35 million depositary units,
each with a proposed maximum offering price of $20.50. The units
represent an 88 percent interest in the limited partnership.
   Immediately before completing the public offering, the
partnership and its 95 percent-owned subsidiary, Plum Creek
Manufacturing Inc., would borrow about $325 million, which, with
the proceeds of the offering, would be used to buy Plum Creek.
   The combined aquisition price is expected to be about $575
million. Burlington Resources will keep a 12 percent interest in
the partnership, along with some of Plum Creek's assets.
   Burlington Resources said its decision to divest Plum Creek was
consistent with its plans to concentrate on its gas, oil and
natural gas pipeline businesses.
   It said it plans to distribute at least 60 cents per unit each
quarter, and if necessary, Burlington Resources would make cash
payments to the partnership to support such distributions.
   Last year, Burlington Northern spun off Burlington Resources to
encompass Burlington's oil, mineral, timber and pipeline segments.
Burlington Northern kept the Burlington Northern Railroad and moved
its headquarters from Seattle to Fort Worth, Texas.

<HEAD>Fusion May Still Be A Generation Away, Fission Leader Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the development of the atom-splitting
fission process is any guide, decades may pass before exciting new
fusion experiments lead to the commerical production of power by
combining atoms, Westinghouse Electric Corp. officials say.
   ``As a rule of thumb, we'd say it's probably 20 to 30 years
away,'' said J. Robert Maxwell, manager of strategic programs for
Westinghouse's energy business. ``It's virtually a test tube
experiment, a bench-top experiment.''
   From the Manhattan project in the early 1940s it took until 1957
to build the first experimental fission power plant at
Shippingport, Pa. Widespread commericial use of the process to make
electricity took another decade.
   Maxwell and another top official at the nation's leading
producer of nuclear power plants say fusion also may pose
significant radiation hazards, although probably not as severe as
those from splitting atoms in fission reactors.
   ``Fusion is not a piece of cake,'' Maxwell said. ``If this turns
out to be successful, then we'll switch to fusion. Then we'll have
to find the new demons and solve them.''
   Nonetheless, Maxwell and the company's top scientist said
reports from the University of Utah, Georgia Tech, Texas A&amp;M and
elsewhere of what appears to be a cold fusion process may bring a
tidal shift in energy production, but not anytime soon.
   The three universities have not even demonstrated a theory of
how the process works.
   ``They have developed an experiment which suggsts there is a
principle that can be demonstrated,'' Maxwell said. ``Probably it
is an advance ... but it causes us some problems of its own that we
have not explored.''
   Fusion could eliminate the problem of spent radioactive fuel
that must be sealed in storage indefinitely. But fusion may have to
take place behind heavy shielding to protect power plant employees,
and it may irradiate power plant components to the point where they
must be handled like the radioactive scrap from today's fission
plants, he said.
   Westinghouse is one of about 10 companies that signed agreements
to review the University of Utah's patent applications on condition
that the lab results remain confidential, James Brophy, university
vice president for research, said Thursday.
   Westinghouse will evaluate Utah's patent applications while
searching for commercial applications for its fusion experiment, R.
D. ``Dee'' Haun Jr., Westinghouse's chief scientist, said Wednesday
in an interview.
   ``It's very tantalizing,'' said Haun, who describes himself as
an enthusiastic skeptic about cold fusion.
   Utah's chemistry department chairman, B. Stanley Pons, and his
colleague, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton,
England, announced March 23 that they had replicated at room
temperature the process that powers the sun and hydrogen bombs.
   Amid great skepticism among scientists, Georgia Tech and Texas
A&amp;M said this week that their separate experiments appear to
confirm the work of Fleischmann and Pons.
   They passed electricity through palladium while the metal was
immersed in heavy water, which differs from regular water in that
its hydrogen component has a heftier nucleus than the lone proton
at the heart of a regular hydrogen atom.
   The heavy hydrogen atoms bond in pairs to create a bigger atom
that releases energy in the form of speeding neutrons as it
deteriorates, Haun said.
   ``Unfortunately, that's as far as classical explanations will
get you,'' he said Wednesday.
   The experiments do not precisely fit existing fusion theories
because far fewer energy-bearing neutrons are being detected than
predicted, Haun said.
   ``But if this works like high-temperature fusion, it could
generate a lot of neutrons, comparable to the number of neutrons in
fission and those neutrons are going to activate the surroundings.
So you'd have a waste disposal problem, a shielding problem,'' he
said.
   However, the neutrons detected in the lab experiments appear to
be roughly 10 billion times fewer than commercial fission, Haun
said.
   A Westinghouse scientist began work March 24 trying to duplicate
the Utah experiment. Results so far are inconclusive, he said.

<HEAD>Texaco Expects $1.3 Billion Profit From Texaco Canada Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Securities analysts say Texaco Inc. is a
dramatically changed company a year after emerging from bankruptcy
and completing a major restructuring.
   At a meeting with analysts Thursday, Texaco officials said the
company is approaching the future with optimism after recording a
$1.3 billion after-tax profit from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc.
   ``There is a kind of change from big revenues and an
empire-builder to a cost-conscious company,'' said one securities
official who asked that his name not be used.
   Texaco's chief financial officer, Allen J. Krowe, told the
analyst group that the $1.3 billion first-quarter profit would be
slightly offset by restructuring expenses.
   Texaco sold its 78 percent stake in the lucrative Canadian
subsidiary to Exxon Corp. in January for $3.24 billion. The deal
was one of the final steps in a massive restructuring following the
company's emergence from bankruptcy last April.
   The company realized nearly $7 billion in total proceeds from
the asset sales, more than the company and analysts had expected.
   Krowe said Texaco revenue would decline slightly in 1989 from
$35.14 billion in 1988, reflecting divestments, although revenue
from continuing operations was expected to rise about 5 percent.
   The financial officer also said Texaco had reduced its debt to
about $7.1 billion at the end of the first quarter from $7.9
billion at the end of 1988 and expects a reduction to $6.5 billion
by year's end.
   On another matter, Texaco President James W. Kinnear said the
oil industry needed to strengthen its efforts to prevent another
spill like last month's disaster off the Alaskan coast, in which a
grounded Exxon tanker spilled about 250,000 barrels of oil into
Prince William Sound.
   ``We have to redouble our efforts to be safe and to make certain
that this in fact was only an isolated incident,'' Kinnear told
reporters.
   Kinnear said he met Thursday with the heads of several other
major oil companies, including Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company,
for the first time to begin discussions on how to prevent a similar
disaster and improve response time.
   Texaco's restructuring has helped boost the company's share
price from $38 a year ago to $53.62{ at Thursday's close on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Despite the changes, analysts agree that Texaco still must make
a big oil discovery if it intends to compete in the future.
Although Texaco is focusing more capital expenditures on
exploration and production, about 80 percent of its efforts involve
going back into old wells using improved technology.
   ``Kinnear has delivered on many things that he said he would,''
Stephen Smith, analyst for Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said before the
meeting. ``But as far as future performance, that will take time.''
   In April 1987, Texaco filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a
potentially ruinous multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight
with Pennzoil Co.
   Pennzoil had sued Texaco, claiming Texaco's 1984 acquisition of
Getty Oil Co. interfered with Pennzoil's prior contract to buy part
of reserve-rich Getty.
   In 1985, a Houston jury awarded Pennzoil a $10.3 billion
judgment. Texaco appealed the judgment but eventually settled with
Pennzoil for $3 billion amid heavy shareholder pressure to do so.

<HEAD>Davis Says Judge's Ruling Won't Affect Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil billionaire Marvin Davis has been told to
keep his distance from Northwest Airlines' pilots, a group playing
an important role in the takeover battle for the carrier involving
Davis and other suitors.
   U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin issued a temporary
restraining order Thursday preventing Davis' Colorado partnership
from ``disrupting'' current contracts or contract negotiations at
the nation's fourth-largest airline. Most important to Northwest
are its ongoing negotiations with the 5,000-member Air Line Pilots
Association.
   The mediated talks are being held to merge the separate
contracts that existed when Northwest acquired Republic Airlines in
1986. The former Republic and Northwest pilots' contracts have
expired.
   Kurt Rivard, a securities analyst for Minneapolis-based Dain
Bosworth Inc., said it is important for Northwest to keep the
pilots happy. Davis or other suitors could gain leverage in their
takeover bids by getting the pilots on their side, he said.
   ``Whoever ends up owning Northwest, they have to be on good
terms with the pilots and the pilots know that,'' Rivard said.
   Davis, who has offered $2.62 billion, or $90 a share, for
Northwest, said MacLaughlin's ruling will not affect him. His bid
has been rejected by NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest, and there
is speculation a higher bid is on its way.
   NWA stock closed Thursday at $90.25, down 50 cents.
   ``Since all of our past and planned communications with union
representatives are in full compliance with the limitations
outlined by the judge, today's ruling will not have any effect on
our future actions,'' a spokesman for Davis said in a statement.
   In its lawsuit, Northwest contended that Davis was violating the
Railway Labor Act by seeking information from the unions about
contract proposals. Davis says his representatives have contacted
the unions representing 34,000 of Northwest's 38,000 employees, but
only to create an ``open dialogue'' with them.
   Edward Glennon, a lawyer for Davis, said all NWA suitors should
be allowed to meet with the airline's unions to dispel fears the
unions may have about possible new owners. The same principle was
at work when Peter Ueberroth recently met with the unions of
Eastern Airlines in a failed bid to buy that carrier, Glennon said.
   A dispute arose Thursday between Northwest, based in suburban
Eagan, and Davis over the nature of Davis' previous contacts with
the unions. For instance, Glennon denied a statement from a
Northwest staff lawyer that Davis has met in person with union
officials. MacLaughlin said he would not attempt to settle the
dispute.
   The temporary restraining order is good for 10 days and could be
extended, the judge said.
   The ruling is limited to Davis and his associates even though
there have been reports that at least two other investment groups
are interested in buying Northwest.
   One of the groups identified in newspaper reports is Wesray
Capital Corp., a New York investment company founded by former U.S.
Treasury Secretary William Simon. The second is a group that
includes Gary L. Wilson, a Walt Disney executive who left
Northwest's board in November; Al Checchi, a Los Angeles
businessman; and Frederick Malek, a former member of the Nixon
White House and campaign adviser to President Bush.
   Three phone calls to Wesray Capital went unanswered Thursday and
a woman who answered the phone in Checchi's office would not
comment on the report.
   Jim Halvorson, a spokesman for the pilots, said Thursday the
union is ``some distance apart'' on key contract issues. He said a
negotiating subcommittee has been formed to discuss the possibility
of creating an employee stock ownership plan. Analysts have said
such a plan would help Northwest defend itself against a takeover
by putting more stock in friendly hands.
   Meanwhile, Northwest is facing lawsuits from dissident
shareholders and Davis that seek to invalidate the company's
``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan. A hearing on Davis' lawsuit is
scheduled for April 24 in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington,
Del., where NWA is incorporated.

<HEAD>Are Incentives Really Working? Many Dealers Say No</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two-week-old incentives apparently drew some car
buyers into showrooms in early April, when vehicle sales soared
28.3 percent over last year, but some in the industry wondered if
car sales really are rebounding.
   Automakers who reported their April 1-10 sales figures Thursday
have been banking on strong results to put off speculation that
large-scale production cuts may be down the road.
   The eight companies that make cars and trucks in the United
States said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 36,967
during early April, compared with a 28,811-vehicle-a-day rate
during the same time last year.
   Car sales shot up 30.1 percent and truck sales were up 25.2
percent over last year's levels.
   Automakers and some analysts said the results were positive
signs that the industry was back on track.
   ``These sales look pretty strong,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York. ``It represents a normal and
healthy response to the latest round in sales incentives.''
   ``Our dealers tell us there is strong consumer interest in and
floor traffic from our new incentive program,'' Robert Rewey, vice
president for Ford Motor Co.'s North American sales operations,
said in a statement.
   But spot checks by The Associated Press late Wednesday and
Thursday of dealers in Ohio, Louisiana, Connecticut, Washington,
Illinois and Arizona showed no consumer rush to buy new cars.
   ``I think people are washed up with incentives,'' said sales
manager Mark Baudean of Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet in New Orleans.
   March and April typically are big months for automakers as
Americans prepare for summer vacations and weekend road trips. But
sales during March and the entire first quarter of 1989 were lower
than expected. Meantime, ambitious production schedules continued
and inventories rose, leading to speculation that without a sales
boost, summertime production cuts and layoffs are growing
possibilities.
   All that led to the latest round of buyer enticements, which
included cut-rate financing and bigger cash rebates on more cars
and trucks.
   On March 29, Ford opened the gates by offering 2.9 percent
financing for two-year loans, along with the rebates.
   General Motors Corp. matched the offer a day later, and on April
3, Chrysler Corp. undercut its competitors by offering
interest-free financing on two-year deals.
   ``While Detroit is likely to put a brave face on this sales
report, management has to be disappointed,'' said analyst Ron
Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``Some sales
have been deferred from late March ... (and) sales are normally
strongest in the first two selling periods after a major increase
in incentives.''
   Tom Webb, a senior economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association in McLain, Va., said it appeared the gain was due more
to the weak period last year than a strong period this year.
   Big incentives last year expired at the end of March. Consumers
attracted by them pushed their buying plans into March, in effect
borrowing sales from later months.
   This year, the situation was reversed. Anticipation of big
incentives began growing in March, prompting some car buyers to
delay purchase plans until they were announced.
   Despite the increase in early April numbers, car and truck sales
through April 10 this year were running 5 percent behind last year,
the second-best in the industry's history. For months, company
executives and analysts have been predicting that sales in 1989
would be lower than 1988.
   Car sales for the year so far were down 7.1 percent and truck
sales were off 1.1 percent.
   Merlis of Morgan Stanley predicted that mid- and late-April
sales figures may not be as strong as the ones reported Thursday.
   ``But it will still be a scenario that it was much better than
generally expected,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar firmed against European currencies
today in quiet trading while the market awaited the release of two
important economic indicators.
   Gold prices retreated after gaining nearly a dollar in Hong Kong.
   European traders reported thin activity this morning as the
market awaited release of data on the U.S. trade deficit and
producer prices.
   In Tokyo, where markets closed before London trading begins, the
dollar slipped 0.35 yen to a closing 132.45. Later, in London, the
dollar traded at 132.55 yen.
   Demand for the dollar remained strong, said Takamas Yamasaki, a
trader for the Daiwa Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Although there are uncertainties over the political and
economic situation here and abroad, investors are inclined to buy
the dollar,'' he said.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.8780 West German marks, up from 1.8720; 1.6525
Swiss francs, up from 1.6422; 6.3520 French francs, up from 6.3335;
2.1183 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1080; 1,377.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,374.00; and 1.1868 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1875.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6945, compared to late
Thursday's $1.7010.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $389.50 a troy ounce, up
from $388.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $388.55.
   In Zurich, the bid price at noon was $388.50, down from $389.15
bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 92 cents to close at a bid
$388.46.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.87 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Thursday.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese
yen, while stock prices rebounded after an early setback.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which shed 192.51 points Thursday, regained 86.50 points, or 0.26
percent, finishing the week at 33,150.44.
   The dollar ended trading at 132.45 yen, down 0.35 yen from
Thursday's 132.80-yen finish. The currency opened lower at 132.00
yen and ranged from 131.92 to 132.53 yen during the day.
   Participants were reluctant to make major moves although demand
for the dollar remained strong, said Takamasa Yamasaki of Daiwa
Bank.
   ``Although there are uncertainties over the political and
economic situation here and abroad, investors are inclined to buy
the dollar,'' he said.
   Higher interest rates in the United States have made the dollar
more attractive to currency investors in Tokyo.
   Today's trading was thin because there was no market-affecting
news prior to U.S. trade figures for February and producer prices
for March due to be released later in the day, Yamasaki said.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index declined 138.67 points by
the end of the morning session, but then reversed directions and
gained ground in the afternoon as institutional investors began
buying cheaper issues, said Kenji Ishizuka, a dealer for Daiwa
Securities.
   ``In the early session, participants either remained on the
sidelines, or sold issues for profit-taking,'' he said.
   With the upcoming weekend and announcement of U.S. economic
figures, market players avoided major moves, Ishizuka said.
   Reports linking Shintaro Abe, secretary-general of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, to the company at the center of a
widening stock-profiteering and bribery scandal also discouraged
participants during the morning session, Ishizuka said.
   Abe admitted that his wife had been paid $2,300 a month in
consulting fees by Recruit Co., the firm at the heart of the
scandal, for two years and seven months.
   Volume traded on the market's first section was estimated at 650
million shares, down from Thursday's 850 million.

<HEAD>Burlington Resources To Spin Off Plum Creek Timber Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington Resources Inc., which itself was spun
off from Burlington Northern Inc. last year, says it plans to
divest its timber and wood products operation, Plum Creek Timber Co.
   Burlington Resources said Plum Creek Timber Co. L.P., a master
limited partnership, registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial public offering, with proceeds to be used
to acquire and run Plum Creek.
   Plum Creek has approximately 1.4 million acres of timberland and
about 9.6 billion board feet of salable softwood timber in the
Pacific Northwest. It employs about 1,800 people in Washington,
Idaho and Montana, and in 1988 had profits of $57.4 million on
revenues of $332.8 million.
   In a news release Thursday, Burlington Resources said the
current management of Plum Creek would remain in place and that no
changes in employment levels would result from the establishment of
the partnership.
   In its registration statement with the SEC, the partnership
seeks an initial public offering of 12.35 million depositary units,
each with a proposed maximum offering price of $20.50. The units
represent an 88 percent interest in the limited partnership.
   The combined acquisition price is expected to be about $575
million.
   Immediately before completing the public offering, the
partnership and its 95 percent-owned subsidiary, Plum Creek
Manufacturing Inc., would borrow about $325 million, which, with
the proceeds of the offering, would be used to buy Plum Creek.
   Burlington Resources will keep a 12 percent interest in the
partnership, along with some of Plum Creek's existing assets.
   Burlington Resources said its decision to divest Plum Creek was
consistent with its plans to concentrate on its gas, oil and
natural gas pipeline businesses.
   Last year, Burlington Northern spun off Burlington Resources as
a separate company encompassing Burlington's oil, mineral, timber
and pipeline segments. Burlington Northern kept the Burlington
Northern Railroad.
   For 1988, Burlington Resources had net income of $72.1 million
or 46 cents a share on revenues of $2.17 billion.

   GAF Corp. has has acquired Sutton
Laboratories, a Chatham-based specialty chemicals manufacturer of
preservatives for the cosmetic and toiletries industry, officials
say.
   No financial details were made public in the Thursday
announcement.
   Sutton is GAF's first acquisition since it became a private
company in October, said Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief
executive officer for GAF.
   ``Sutton is a strategic acquistion that strengthens our
long-term major commitment to the cosmetic, toiletries and
healthcare industries,'' Heyman said in a written statement.
   GAF will operate Sutton as a free-standing subsidiary under its
current names. William Rosen, formerly executive vice president of
Sutton, has been named president and will have full responsibility
for Sutton's worldwide operations.
   Sutton was founded in 1955 and produces preservatives used for
shampoos, conditioners and other hair preparations, hand and body
creams and lotions, bubble baths, cleansers, makeup, mascaras and
sun-screen preparations.

<HEAD>IBM Earnings Rise 1.8 Percent Excluding Accounting Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said today
its profit rose 1.8 percent in the first quarter excluding the
effect of an accounting change that had swelled earnings in 1988.
   The world's biggest computer company said it earned $950 million
in the three months ended March 31. IBM earned $933 million a year
earlier from normal operations, but final net income in 1988 was
$1.25 billion after inclusion of a $315 million gain from the
accounting change.
   Including the effect of the one-time gain in 1988, net income
fell 23.9 percent. The accounting change related to the treatment
of deferred taxes.
   Earnings per share were $1.61. That was up from $1.57 in 1988
before the accounting change, but down from the $2.10 recorded
after the accounting change.
   Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $12.7 billion from $12.06 billion.
   IBM stock was up $1.50 a share to $110.75 in New York Stock
Exchange trading shortly after the announcement. The stock fell
last month after the company warned that a problem with chips had
delayed shipments of some of its big mainframe computers.
   ``IBM's product and service offerings continue to grow stronger,
and we are benefiting from our improving customer partnerships as
well as our restructuring actions,'' John F. Akers, the chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement.
   ``Our expectations for 1989 remain unchanged,'' Akers said.

   The stock market staged a sharp rally today,
encouraged by an apparent easing of inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 21.45 to
2,317.45 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 1 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 762 up, 186 down and
448 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.94 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March, compared with 1 percent
increases in each of the two preceding months.
   The figure came in close to advance estimates. Nevertheless,
analysts said investors were relieved that the report didn't
contain another unpleasant surprise.
   Separately, International Business Machines reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing,
in light of IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this
year weren't likely to live up to some of the most optimistic
estimates in the financial world.
   IBM shares gained 1\ to 110{. Among other leading technology
issues, Digital Equipment rose 1\ to 98\; Honeywell 1[ to 71}, and
Hewlett-Packard 1\ to 54}.
   On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce
Department reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to
$10.50 billion in February and the Federal Reserve said industrial
production was unchanged in March from the month before. Both
numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates.
   General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings
for the first quarter on Thursday, rose } to 46.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.26 to 167.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .81 at 334.25.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 23.65

   Wholesale prices, despite a big jump in home
heating oil costs, rose a moderate 0.4 percent in March as
inflation eased somewhat after steep increases of 1 percent in each
of the previous two months, the government said today.
   The boost in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
reflected higher costs for both food and energy, although the
increases in both categories were smaller than those registered in
the first two months of the year.
   The overall gain was close to analysts' expectations and helped
calm Wall Street's inflation fears, causing a sharp rally in early
trading today.
   The stock market staged a sharp rally, encouraged by the
apparent easing of inflationary pressures. The Dow Jones average of
30 industrials climbed 21.45 to 2,317.45 in the first half hour of
trading.
   While March's increase was much more restrained than the strong
jumps of the previous two months, wholesale prices one stop short
of retail have risen at a compound annual rate of 10.2 percent over
the past three months.
   That is the largest quarterly increase since prices rose at a
compound annual rate of 13.2 percent during the first three months
of 1981.
   Should the first quarter's rate be sustained for the rest of the
year, it would far exceed the increase registered for 1988, when
wholesale prices rose 4 percent in what was the steepest gain in
seven years. Prices had risen 2.2 percent in 1987.
   Financial markets had been fearful that further bad news on the
inflation front would prompt the Federal Reserve Board to step up
its campaign to slow economic growth and restrain inflationary
pressures by pushing up interest rates.
   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, said the latest report was good news but
doesn't totally put to rest worries about accelerating inflation.
   ``I don't think at all that this suggests that the inflation
watch should be terminated,'' he said. ``I don't think this battle
is over.''
   Wholesale food prices rose 0.8 percent last month after jumping
1.2 percent during February. Last month's increase in food costs
was led by a 38.8 percent gain in prices for eggs while vegetable
costs dropped 11.6 percent after surging 35.3 percent during
February.
   Energy prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent in March following a
2.4 percent increase during the previous month. Last month's
increase was led by a 16.8 percent rise in home heating oil prices,
while gasoline costs rose 3.5 percent and natural gas prices
declined 5.4 percent.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose
0.3 percent in March, down from a 0.6 percent increase a month
earlier.
   The overall March increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 112.2, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $112.20 last month.
   That was up 50 cents from February and 5.6 percent above March
1988.
   The troubling inflation reports at the start of 1989 had come
even as signs emerge that the economy is cooling off in response to
the Fed's anti-inflation campaign.
   Three other government reports released today added to growing
evidence that the economy is slowing down:
   _The U.S. merchandise trade deficit swelled by 20.9 percent to
$10.5 billion in February as Americans increased their appetite for
foreign goods, the Commerce Department reported.
   _The operating rate for U.S. factories declined for the second
consecutive month in March to 84 percent, the first back-to-back
declines in nearly three years, the Federal Reserve Board said.
   _Business inventories rose 0.5 percent in February while sales
plunged 0.9 percent, the steepest decline in more than two years,
Commerce reported.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., said in advance
of today's reports that while the economy does seem to be losing
steam, it may take awhile for that to translate into inflation
relief.
   ``There is a tendency to expect inflation to weaken as soon as
the economy starts to slow, but more often than not it doesn't
happen that way,'' Sinai said. ``More often than not, it takes a
weak economy for quite some time before inflation begins to peak
and then drop.''
   Despite the moderate price hikes last month for finished goods
such as bread and clothing, the index for prices at earlier stages
of production demonstrated stronger inflation.
   Prices at the intermediate level for items such as flour and
cloth rose 0.7 percent, while the cost of crude goods such as
cotton and wheat was up 2.3 percent.
   March's figures on increases in consumer prices, which so far
this year have been smaller than those at the wholesale level, will
be released on Tuesday. The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent
in February and 0.6 percent in January.
   Sinai and many others are forecasting a mild recession by the
first half of 1990, but other analysts still are hopeful that the
Fed can slow the economy just enough to restrain inflation and
produce a ``soft landing'' in which growth slows but the economy
avoids an outright downturn.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The banking industry may have a staid image, but
recent times have demonstrated that investing in bank stocks can be
a real adventure.
   Consider what has happened with BankAmerica Corp., which
operates the third largest bank in the country.
   After trading close to $30 all through the late 1970s and early
1980s, it embarked on a long slide to just above $5 in late 1987 as
losses mounted and the company stopped paying dividends.
   Since that time, as BankAmerica has straightened out some of its
problems and returned to profitability, the shares have soared back
to a recent high of $25. The first dividend since 1985 was paid in
March.
   BankAmerica may be an extreme example. But stocks of other large
``money center'' banks (as opposed to regional or local
institutions) also have had their share of ups and downs of late.
   In recent weeks the emphasis has been on the ``ups,'' thanks to
widespread hopes that the earnings outlook for most banks will
improve under the Bush administration's new plan for dealing with
the debt problems of Third World countries.
   New York-based Citicorp, for example, has racked up a gain of
some 66 percent since early 1988, climbing from $18 to a shade
above $30.
   Over the same span, Chase Manhattan has risen from around $21 to
past $35, for a similar percentage gain. Manufacturers Hanover has
rallied from around $19 to the mid-$30s.
   The recent sharp rise in the group ``underscores the great
volatility of these stocks,'' says Chris Kotowski, an analyst at
Oppenheimer &amp; Co., in a current report on the industry.
   While the debt problems of lesser-developed countries have been
a touchy issue for a long time, and banks are in the center of a
stormy interest-rate environment, Kotowski says he doesn't believe
it is just news in itself that makes the big bank stocks so jumpy.
   ``Instead,'' he says, ``we believe the volatility is caused in
large part by the very narrowly based institutional ownership of
these shares.''
   The 25 investing institutions that represent the biggest owners
by themselves hold 28 percent of all the shares of the six major
money-center banks, Kotowski notes.
   ``This narrow base of ownership, in our opinion, accentuates all
major moves in the group, both positive and negative.
   ``In rally phases, such as the present one, most institutions
not among the 25 major money-center bank stock owners discover that
they are substantially underweighted in the group and then rush in
to the stocks in fear of missing a great, historical move.
   ``In downward moves, the slide can be very sharp because most
institutions do not like to own the stocks, and those that do
already own very high concentrations in the group.''
   The pattern has been evident for some time, Kotowski observed.
In 1987, after Citicorp took the dramatic step of setting aside a
big reserve against its loans to lesser-developed countries,
money-center bank stocks jumped 20 percent to 25 percent in six
weeks.
   That rally subsequently collapsed, leaving the group with a net
loss of 35 percent for all of 1987. True, there was a market crash
that autumn, but measures of blue-chip industrial stocks still
finished the year showing a small overall gain.
   It may be that venturesome investors in this group will benefit
handsomely in the future from some ultimate resolution of the Third
World debt snarl. Alternatively, speculators may find themselves in
for a long wait.
   Either way, however, the record of the past several years makes
it plain that money in bank stocks is very different from money in
the bank.

<HEAD>Dry Weather Fears Boost Crop Futures</HEAD>

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose modestly
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by perceptions
of continuing dry weather in some of the nation's major
crop-growing areas.
   Many private meteorologists are predicting another month of
dryer-than-normal conditions in the Midwest and Great Plains.
   Those forecasts contradict a National Weather Service 30-day
outlook issued Thursday afternoon, which called for normal
precipitation in most growing areas.
   But traders are paying more attention to actual precipitation
levels, which are well below normal for this time of year in
Illinois and Iowa, two major corn and soybean states hit hard by
last year's drought.
   ``People are talking dry weather for the most part,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc.
   The National Weather Service will issue a new 6-to-10-day
outlook this afternoon.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.09 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1{ cents higher with May at $2.69\ a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with May at $1.85{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 7 cents higher with May at $7.28 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed and pork futures were higher in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .20 cent higher with June at 71.15
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .33 cent higher
with May at 75.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent to .27
cent higher with June at 46.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .10 cent to .20 cent higher with May at 33.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Thursday.

   The stock market rose sharply today in buying
encouraged by an apparent easing of inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 32.45 to
2,328.45 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 901 up, 364 down and
508 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March, compared with 1 percent
increases in each of the two preceding months.
   The figure came in close to advance estimates. Nevertheless,
analysts said investors were relieved that the report didn't
contain another unpleasant surprise.
   Separately, International Business Machines reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing,
in light of IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this
year weren't likely to live up to some of the most optimistic
estimates in the financial world.
   IBM shares gained 2[ to 111]. Among other leading technology
issues, Digital Equipment rose | to 97|; Honeywell | to 71\, and
Hewlett-Packard 1~ to 55].
   On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce
Department reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to
$10.50 billion in February and the Federal Reserve said industrial
production was unchanged in March from the month before. Both
numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates.
   General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings
for the first quarter on Thursday, led the active list and rose ~
to 46[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.86 to 168.40. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.33 at 334.77.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 83.10 million shares at
noontime, up from 70.12 million at the same point Thursday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and congressional leaders
announced today a nearly $28 billion deficit-reduction plan that
Bush said would be ``a first, manageable step'' toward stemming the
tide of red ink.
   The agreement, thrashed out in more than a month of talks that
concluded late Thursday night, minimally meets next year's goal of
reducing the deficit to $100 billion, while putting off the tough
choices until later.
   It allows the president to claim he won't violate his campaign
pledge against new taxes, and he agreed to lower his defense
spending plans so that Congress could avert a squeeze on popular
domestic programs.
   ``The budget agreement does not complete the whole
deficit-reduction job ... but I am convinced that we will only be
able to complete that job if we tackle it in manageable steps on an
orderly basis in a constructive bipartisan spirit,'' Bush said.
``And this is a first manageable step.''
   ``This is not an heroic agreement,'' said House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas. ``If we begin with the assumption that there can
be no significant major increase in revenue, this agreement is
about as good as we could do.''
   ``No one should be deluded into thinking that this is the end of
the process,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine. ``Much sterner measures will be required in the future.''
   Bush and the House and Senate leadership sealed the deal in a
morning meeting in the Cabinet Room, and then announced it at a
Rose Garden ceremony.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, attended the meeting with the president but refused to
join in the announcement.
   ``He declined to go out in the Rose Garden and have his picture
taken because he doesn't like the agreement,'' said Jack Devore,
Bentsen's spokesman.
   The senator told the president ``that he thought the budget was
marginal, that he's concerned that it depends on wildly optimistic
economic assumptions and there remains a great gulf between the
Congress and the administration on how you raise the $5.3 billion
in new taxes Bush is calling for,'' Devore said.
   The plan claims to reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit to about $99.4
billion, meeting the goal of the Gramm-Rudman law of a deficit no
larger than $100 billion in the year beginning Oct. 1.
   The deficit next year would be about $126.6 billion under
current government policies, compared with about $163 billion this
fiscal year, according to administration estimates.
   About half of the deficit reduction, $14.2 billion, would come
from a combination of increased revenues including $5.8 billion in
taxes, $2.7 billion in fees for government services and $5.7
billion from selling government assets, according to sources
familiar with the package.
   Details of the revenue sources were left unspecified, to be
worked out later as Congress and its committees draft the
legislation to implement the pact. The budget agreement itself does
not have the force of law, but it will provide a framework for the
actual spending bills passed later.
   The tax figure includes $500 million through increased
enforcement of the tax code, but achieving the other $5.3 billion
will either mean finding taxes that Bush doesn't believe violate
his campaign pledges, or Congress acceding to Bush's claim that
cutting the capital gains tax rate will bring in more revenue, not
less.
   Bush wants a lower capital gains tax and says it would actually
increase revenue in fiscal 1990 because of an increase in that type
of financial activity. Democrats argue that the plan is a big
revenue loser in the long run, with the wealthy sopping up most of
the benefits.
   On the spending side, the plan would restrain overall growth for
fiscal 1990 in both domestic and military programs to below the
rate of inflation.
   The Pentagon would be held to about $299 billion in outlays,
virtually the same as this year. Military spending authority, which
includes commitments that span more than one fiscal year, would be
about $305.5 billion.
   Current cost controls in the Medicare health plan would be
extended and other restraints would be imposed on that fast-growing
entitlement, without cutting benefits. Overall spending by
government agencies would be increased with the rate of inflation,
although the Congress and Bush would presumably cut some programs
to make room for additional spending in others.
   Even before the agreement was announced, negotiators were saying
that more needed to be done, especially if the deficit path is to
continue downward and reach the $64 billion goal for fiscal 1991.
Deep spending cuts or significant tax increases would be needed to
meet that goal, the negotiators concluded, and they decided against
tackling it in the current round of talks.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the House
Budget Committee, called the result ``something of a
disappointment.''
   ``It does not make substantial reductions in our spending''
although it slows the upward trend. ``It isn't what I had hoped
for,'' he said.
   ``It's going to make the work for next year very difficult,'' he
said.
   A big chunk of the deficit plan is made up of one-shot savings
and accounting gimmicks that don't lessen the long-term deficit
problem.
   Sales of government assets, which are frequently loan
portfolios, often cost the Treasury in the long run.
   The plan lists $1.9 billion in savings from reduced payments to
farmers, but more than half of that would be by paying farmers
early so the checks are written this fiscal year instead of next.
More than $3 billion of the other ``savings'' in the plan come from
accounting changes, such as moving the postal service ``off
budget.''
   The plan also claims that by rejecting its pay raise earlier
this year, Congress saved $100 million.
   More than $1 billion of the deficit reduction is calculated
because the government would pay less interest because of the
savings in the rest of the plan.
   Although the plan claims to reduce the deficit to slightly below
the $100 billion Gramm-Rudman ceiling, the law does not count the
$5.7 billion in asset sales toward that target.
   The plan also relies on administration economic assumptions
which are widely regarded as too optimistic. If the economy does
not meet those expectations of strong growth and low interest
rates, the real deficit will exceed the one calculated in advance
for the purposes of the Gramm-Rudman law.
   If Congress and the president fail to enact spending and tax
bills that, at least on paper, bring the deficit to within $10
billion of Gramm-Rudman's $100 billion target, the law requires the
administration to cut military and domestic spending across the
board. Only Social Security and welfare programs are exempt from
such cuts.

<TEXT>
   The head of the Coast Guard, acting on
stern orders from President Bush, has given Exxon until Saturday to
produce a cleanup plan for the nation's largest oil spill.
   As the remainder of the oil slick from the Exxon Valdez
continued to break up, attention turned to the long task of
cleaning up Prince William Sound, one of the world's most
untarnished waterways until the supertanker ran aground.
   Exxon announced Thursday that it would make a $15 million ``down
payment'' on a fund for studies of the impact of the spill, and
federal investigators announced hearings next month into the cause
of the disaster.
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost set the deadline for the oil
company's cleanup plan, including details on the number of workers,
equipment and logistics, after he arrived Thursday to take charge
of the operation.
   It had been feared that oil might move around Gore Point
southwest of Prince William Sound and north into Cook Inlet, where
a lucrative halibut fishery is scheduled to open in a month. But it
appeared today that choppy seas were continuing to disperse the
spill, churning parts of it into a chocolate-mousse-like substance.
   ``It's mostly due to the weather; it's breaking up,'' Coast
Guard Chief Petty Officer Roy Compton said this morning. ``They're
seeing patches of sheen and a little bit of mousse in the Gore
Point area.''
   Compton said damage was still not completely assessed on the
Exxon Valdez, which was nestled in a cove on oil-blackened Naked
Island. Repairs were under way but ``it's going to be a while
before they're all finished,'' he said.
   Yost indicated that he believed the company, already a week late
in meeting a similar deadline set by the state, would now produce
the plan.
   But he described the magnitude of the 10.1 million-gallon spill
as overwhelming.
   ``There's not a contingency plan, whether it's San Francisco
Bay, whether it's New York Harbor, whether it's Puget Sound,
there's not a contingency plan that exists that would have
addressed a spill ... of 10 million gallons,'' Yost said.
   The Coast Guard has been given final authority over the cleanup
of the oil that poured from the tanker, which veered sharply out of
shipping lanes March 24 and slammed into a treacherous reef.
   Yost said President Bush sent him ``to take personal oversight
of the coordination of this cleanup that Exxon's doing.''
   ``Things are getting better, and we're going to do everything we
can to expedite the cleanup,'' Yost said after flying over the area.
   Yost said he considers his relationship with the oil company to
be adversarial.
   ``I have some marching orders from the president of the United
States and it means it is not a happy or cozy relationship with
Exxon,'' he said.
   Exxon's failure to produce a plan has angered state officials,
who earlier requested a Coast Guard takeover of the cleanup. State
environmental chief Dennis Kelso said Thursday he still had not
received such a plan, even though he requested one weeks ago.
   Jan Cool, an Exxon spokeswoman, said the company had no comments
on Yost's statements.
   While the cleanup of oil-soaked beaches has just begun, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday
that Exxon has contributed $15 million for the agency's cost of
assessing the spill's long-term impact. Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan had complained Wednesday that Exxon was slow in making the
payment.
   NOAA Administrator William Evans said the money was just a
``down payment'' for money already spent by his agency in the
attempt to fight the spill.
   Thousands of sea birds and mammals have already died in the oily
muck that washed up on beaches following the spill. There are also
fears of the oil's impact on the rich fisheries of the sound.
   Splotchy remainders of the spill, some no bigger than a table
top, meandered west of Gore Point and the edge of the Chugach
Islands on the edge of Cook Inlet on Thursday.
   But officials' attention turned to the oiled beaches where
damage was the greatest.
   Kelso said the state has identified 3,000 separate cleanup areas
on islands in the sound. He said 44 of those sites are now ready
for cleanup crews.
   Cleanup crews were at some of the beaches on Thursday, shoveling
up oil, scraping rocks and using low-pressure water hoses to flush
the oil back into the water where it was trapped and recovered.
   Exxon-paid cleanup workers have filled hundreds of bags a day
with thick crude oil and gravel on Naked Island. ``We're doing good
enough that every day it's harder to find oil to pick up. That
means something,'' said Dean Carl, a wood boat refinisher from
Valdez.
   As the cleanup began in earnest, the National Transportation
Safety Board announced it will hold four days of public hearings
beginning May 16 in Anchorage to determine the probable cause of
the accident.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rebound On Spate of Economic Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rebounded sharply in heavy trading
today following several government reports suggesting an easing of
inflationary pressures.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue jumped 1 3-16 point, or
about $12 for every $1,000 in face amount, as its yield, which
moves inversely to price, fell to 9.03 percent from 9.15 percent
late Thursday.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March _ better than the 0.5
percent many had expected. The index, which measures inflation at
the wholesale level, had increased 1 percent in each of the two
previous months.
   ``The worst fears that some market observers had expressed
regarding the possibility of a big increase in the producer price
index were soundly refuted,'' said Marshall B. Front, economist at
the Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe
&amp; Farnham.
   The government also said the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for
February widened by 20.9 percent to $10.5 billion from January's
$8.98 billion.
   And the government reported a 0.2 percent decline in the
operating rate for U.S. factories last month to 84 percent, the
second consecutive monthly decline. Business inventories rose 0.5
percent in February while sales plunged 0.9 percent in their
steepest decline in more than two years, the government said.
   The reports were consistent with expectations, analysts said,
and fit in with other evidence of slower growth, including
lackluster retail sales and a slackening of employment growth in
March.
   ``Other concerns about rising inflation and the possibility of
the Fed tightening seem to be less of a reality than before these
figures were released,'' Front said.
   Inflation and high interest rates erode the value of
fixed-income securities such as bonds.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
notes were up between 13-32 and 17-32 point, intermediate issues
were } point to 27-32 point higher and long-term issues rose as
much as 1 1-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
reporting service.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, jumped 6.94 to 1,125.23.
   In corporate trading, prices also advanced. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.88
to 300.02.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, declined to
8.89, while the discount fell 17 basis points to 8.59 percent.
Yields on six-month bills declined to 9.16 percent as the discount
also dropped 17 basis points to 8.67 percent. Yields on one-year
bills fell to 9.35 percent as the discount lost 19 basis points to
8.63 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, remained at 913-16 percent, the same as late Thursday.

<HEAD>First Quarter Earnings Drop At Merrill Lynch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter profits at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
plunged 46 percent despite a 25 percent jump in revenue as the
nation's largest brokerage continued to be plagued by a weak
business environment.
   For the period ended March 31, Merrill reported net earnings of
$37.2 million, or 31 cents a share, down from $68.3 million, or 62
cents a share in the year-ago period.
   Revenue during the quarter jumped to $3 billion from $2.4
billion in the first quarter of 1988, primarily due to a 60 percent
increase in interest and dividend revenue. The company noted that
exclusive of these increases, however, revenue increased just 5
percent.
   ``These results reflect the continuing weakness in the market
environment for many of our core business activities,'' said
Merrill Chairman William A. Schryer.
   But he noted that ``a strong capital base, growing client assets
... diversification of businesses and gains in institutional market
share'' will help Merrill ``prosper when market conditions
improve.''
   Merger and acquisition advisory services and corporate bond
underwritings boosted investment banking revenues by 10 percent to
$248 million, although a decline in equity underwritings partly
offset the gain.
   Asset management and custodial fee revenue rose along with
insurance revenue and real estate revenues generated by Fine Homes
International. But commission revenue declined 5 percent to $417
million because of a continued lull in stock trading volume.
Principal transaction revenue also declined, down 15 percent to
$348 million.
   At the end of the quarter, Merrill reported $290 billion in
total customer assets, up 15 percent from the year-ago period.

<TEXT>
   Michael Milken agreed today to set aside more
than $600 million in assets and post a $1 million bond in
connection with wide-ranging racketeering and fraud charges against
the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier.
   Saying Milken was not a threat to flee the country before an
expected trial, U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood denied the
government's request that Milken post $250 million in bail money.
   In addition, Milken's brother Lowell, who also faces fraud and
racketeering charges, agreed to set aside $50 million in assets in
the face of the racketeering statutes and was ordered to post a $1
million bond secured by other assets.
   The Milkens left the courthouse to applause from about 100
supporters who attended the hearing, but did not comment.
   The ruling means the Milkens will be free pending a trial
prosecutors say is expected to last more than six months and should
mark a high point in the government's nearly three-year crackdown
on Wall Street fraud.
   The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg were
charged in a 98-count racketeering and fraud indictment handed up
March 29 that seeks some $1.8 billion in forfeitures.
   Under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
act, the government could have sought to freeze all of the
defendants' assets before a trial as a guarantee they wouldn't sell
or otherwise dilute them to avoid massive penalties if convicted.
   The agreement announced at a Manhattan federal court hearing
requires Michael Milken to place $300 million cash in an account to
be monitored by the government and to sign a note securing $300
million more in less liquid assets.
   Milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdings
in Drexel _ which total 6 percent of the investment firm and are
estimated at about $100 million _ as soon as the firm's settlement
of separate civil charges with the Securities and Exchange
Commission officially takes effect.
   That deal announced Thursday resolves a range of separate civil
charges against Drexel and requires the Wall Street giant to
dismiss Milken, sever all business dealings with him and force him
to give up his Drexel holdings.
   ``In substance, your honor, we expect the security for
forfeiture in this case will amount to $700 million,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said.
   Flanked by a group of defense lawyers, Milken and his brother
attended the hearing but did not address the judge.
   ``The defendants not only contest the indictment but they
seriously, expressly contest the government's theories on
forfeiture,'' said Arthur L. Liman, Michael Milken's attorney.
   Defense lawyers and prosecutors have grappled over the terms of
the bond package since the long-awaited Milken indictment was
handed up. The government reportedly initially sought $1 billion in
pretrial asset holdings.
   Milken, who reportedly made more than $1 billion between 1983
and 1987, under the deal also is barred from transferring any
assets out of the country and must gradually sell assets to convert
the $300 million note to cash. Milken also surrendered his passport.
   Carroll sought $250 million in bail, claiming the potential
racketeering forfeitures ``gives (the Milkens) powerful incentive
to absent themselves should they choose to do so.''
   ``Should they flee to someplace where they could not be
extradited, they could live comfortably the rest of their lives,''
he said.
   Liman asked Judge Wood to free Milken without having to make
bail, saying he was a ``homebody'' who posed no threat to leave the
country. If the Milkens had sought to flee, they would have done so
long ago, their attorneys said.
   Wood ruled that the brothers, who both have lived near Los
Angeles most of their lives, were ``excellent candidates for bail''
but she set $1 million bail for each of them because of the scope
of the indictment and the asset retention package.
   The bond, which will be secured by other assets, must be posted
by Monday.
   Newberg, who also faces a racketeering indictment in a related
case, agreed to set aside $1.6 million in assets. He has yet not
been arraigned because of a skiing injury and no bail terms were
set.
   Michael Milken, 42, has been the main target of the government's
crackdown on white-collar crime. He is widely credited with
reshaping corporate America in the 1980s through the sale of
high-yield junk bonds from Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office.
   The probe of Drexel and Milken is based in large part on
information by jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky, whose revelations
stunned Wall Street in 1986. Boesky has completed one year of a
three-year jail term.

<HEAD>Holly Shareholders Consider ConAgra Merger</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with vote taken, meeting adjourned till Monday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Holly Farms Corp. voted
today on the poultry processor's proposed $1.1 billion merger with
ConAgra Inc., but the results of the ballot were not expected to be
known until Monday.
   Shareholders met at a Memphis hotel to consider the ConAgra
proposal, which is backed by Holly Farms management. ConAgra
shareholders were scheduled to vote on the proposal later in the
day in Omaha, where that company is headquartered.
   After the Holly Farms vote was taken, officials adjourned the
meeting until Monday.
   ConAgra has threatened court action if parts of a merger
agreement reached with Holly Farms last November are not honored.
   However, Tyson Foods Inc., the rival poultry processor that has
tried since last October to take over Holly Farms, has vowed to
continue its court fight to block the proposed merger with ConAgra.
   Tyson, headquartered in Springdale, Ark., has made a cash offer
of $63.50 a share to Holly Farms stockholders for a deal worth
about $1.15 billion. Buying Holly Farms would permit Tyson to
remain the largest poultry processor in the country.
   The proposed ConAgra-Holly Farms merger calls for a stock swap
valued at $60 a share for Holly Farms stockholders. Holly Farms
shareholders would get 1.875 shares of ConAgra stock for each share
of Holly Farms stock traded.
   A major point of argument in the ConAgra-Holly Farms proposal is
a provision allowing ConAgra to purchase major Holly Farms assets
should the merger fall through.
   Tyson has filed suit in Chancery Court in Delaware attacking the
provision as an unfair attempt to block a buyout by anyone else.
The judge handling the suit has said the so-called ``asset-option
agreement'' appears to be unenforcable and has issued a temporary
injunction blocking it.
   Under the agreement, ConAgra would be allowed to buy Holly Farms
subsidiary Harker's Inc. of LeMars, Iowa, for $148.8 million, Holly
Farms of Texas Inc. for a like amount and Holly Farms facilities in
Wilkesboro, N.C., for $127.5 million.
   Those purchases would cover some 34 percent of Holly Farms'
total assets.
   Meanwhile, executives of Tyson Foods entertained shareholders of
Holly Farms Thursday night, a day before the critical vote.
   Don Tyson, president of the Arkansas firm, made a formal pitch
today to the shareholders.
   Prior to the meeting of Holly shareholders, Tyson said it had
been tendered more than 10 million, or about 55 percent, of Holly's
18.4 million shares.

<HEAD>Time's Earnings Off 26 Percent, Pulitzer Publishing Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Inc. said Friday its first-quarter profit tumbled 26
percent due to lower operating earnings from its magazines, heavier
interest expenses and costs related to its pending merger with
Warner Communications Inc.
   Another media company, Pulitzer Publishing Co., said its
first-quarter earnings rose 23.2 percent as its interest expenses
fell.
   New York-based Time said it earned $49 million, or 87 cents a
share, in the three months ended March 31, compared with $66
million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 6.7 percent to $1.14 billion from
$1.07 billion in 1988.
   Time said operating income from its magazine segment fell to $61
million from $70 million in 1988 despite a 7 percent rise in
magazine revenue.
   The revenue increases, due mainly to strong circulation at
Sports Illustrated and People, were more than offset by higher
print order expenses, including those for the newly-launched Sports
Illustrated for Kids.
   The books segment operated at break-even for the quarter, the
same as a year earlier, while operating income from programming,
which includes the Home Box Office Inc. pay-TV services and HBO
Video, rose 5.1 percent.
   Time's operating profit from its interest in the cable TV
operator American Television and Communications Corp. rose 31
percent to $55 million.
   Time said its corporate interest expenses rose $10 million,
reflecting higher debt resulting from its purchase of a
half-interest in the media concern Whittle Communications LP and
ATC's investment in a Memphis cable system.
   In addition, Time said it incurred $15 million in costs relating
to its proposed merger with Warner Communications. The merger,
which Time hopes will be completed by fall, would create the
world's largest media and entertainmnet concern with revenue of
about $10 billion a year.
   Pulitzer, based in St. Louis, said it earned $3.1 million, or 29
cents per share, in the first quarter, up from $2.5 million, or 24
cents a share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue rose 3.9 percent to $94.1 million from
$90.5 million in 1988.
   Pulitzer has interests in newspaper publishing including the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch and The Arizona Daily Star in Tuscon, Ariz.,
and owns seven network-affiliated television stations and two radio
stations.

   The stock market rolled up a strong gain today
in buying encouraged by an apparent easing of inflationary
pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 37.03 to
2,333.03 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,034 up,
368 down and 481 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March, compared with 1 percent
increases in each of the two preceding months.
   The figure came in close to advance estimates. Nevertheless,
analysts said investors were relieved that the report didn't
contain another unpleasant surprise.
   Separately, International Business Machines reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing,
in light of IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this
year weren't likely to live up to some of the most optimistic
estimates in the financial world.
   IBM shares gained 2] to 111|. Among other leading technology
issues, Digital Equipment rose \ to 97\; Honeywell { to 71[, and
Hewlett-Packard 2 to 55{.
   On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce
Department reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to
$10.50 billion in February and the Federal Reserve said industrial
production was unchanged in March from the month before. Both
numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates.
   General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings
for the first quarter on Thursday, rose 1] to 46|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
2.07 to 168.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.36 at 334.80.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 124.07 million shares with two
hours to go.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices rosel sharply on the London Stock Exchange
Friday, boosted by an early rally on Wall Street and by the release
of a series of favorable U.S. and British economic data.
   Shares began rising strongly in the afternoon, after trading
tentatively through the morning. The day's gains ended a string of
lackluster sessions this week as participants nervously awaited
Friday's key economic statistics.
   At the close the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was up 24.9, or 1.22 percent at 2053.6, its best level of the day.
   For the week, the index moved up 7.9 points.
   Volume, at 648.1 million shares, was brisk by recent standards,
but this was inflated by a substantial program trade around midday,
dealers said. On Thursday, volume totaled 464.3 million shares.
   The market's first boost came with the news that British retail
prices rose 7.9 percent in March from the previous year, in line
with economists' forecasts. Inflation fears have weighed heavily on
the market in recent weeks, and there were fears Friday's retail
price data could have been worse.
   The market was reassured further with the release of U.S.
statistics that also conformed to, or slightly bettered,
expectations. The data showed that U.S. producer prices rose 0.4
percent in March, copared with 1-percent rises in each of the two
preceding months.
   Also, the U.S. trade deficit widened in February to $10.5
billion from a revised $8.68 billion in January.
   ``The figures were quite good today,'' said one dealer. ``The
market seems to want to go higher.''
   Equities continued to advance after Wall Street opened strongly
higher. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 33 points at the
time of the London close.
   Dealers said the London market also was encouraged by news that
President Bush had worked out an agreement with Congress on the
fiscal 1990 budget.

<HEAD>Pritzker Participates in Eastern Airlines Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sources said billionaire hotelier Jay Pritzker
joined the wrangling for Eastern Airlines today in a meeting laden
with uncertainty following the failed deal to peddle the
strike-dogged carrier to former baseball boss Peter Ueberroth.
   The sources close to the situation said Pritzker, who reportedly
has offered $500 million for Eastern, was among those attending a
meeting of lawyers for creditors, the unions and the airline's
management at a Manhattan law firm. The sources asked not to be
identified.
   Pritzker, owner of the Hyatt hotel chain, had been interested in
buying Eastern but withdrew after Ueberroth announced his agreement
to buy it April 6. The deal collapsed Wednesday because of an
intractable dispute over whether an outsider would run the airline
until his group could assume control.
   Eastern's unions have been on strike since March 4 and the
moneylosing airline has been under federal bankruptcy court
protection since March 9.
   The unions have insisted that Frank Lorenzo, head of parent
company Texas Air Corp., surrender management authority to a
court-appointed outsider no matter what happens to Eastern.
   On Thursday, Lorenzo said he is turning attention to his plan to
reorganize Eastern as a much smaller airline.
   In Miami, meanwhile, American Airlines chief Robert Crandall
said American is interested in such Eastern assets as its Latin
American and Canadian routes. American, one of Eastern's leading
rivals, already is expanding to capitalize on the embattled
carrier's problems.
   While Lorenzo seemed to rule out the possibility of a sale,
federal bankruptcy judge Burton Lifland moved late Wednesday to
lure other buyers _ raising the possibility of an auction
supervised by his court.
   And some union leaders at Eastern insisted that Lorenzo's deal
with the former baseball commissioner could still be revived.
   ``Anyone familiar with these situations will tell you that deals
get done and undone many times, almost with predictable regularity,
before being finalized,'' Jack Bavis, head of the pilots union at
Eastern, said Thursday. ``We believe that Mr. Ueberroth is not
totally out of the picture yet, and there are other potential
players as well.''
   Eastern Machinists leader Charles Bryan, in a speech today in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said Ueberroth had called him this morning.
Bryan wouldn't disclose the nature of the call but said he doesn't
consider Ueberroth out of the game.
   In addition to Ueberroth and Pritzker, another potential suitor
is takeover strategist Carl Icahn, owner and chairman of Trans
World Airlines Inc., who said Wednesday he is still interested in a
possible bid for Eastern.
   Under Lorenzo's new plan, Eastern ``will be a lot smaller,''
said the chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. However, he
asserted, ``We are not going to have any difficulty over time
building back.''
   At a separate speaking engagement, Ueberroth said in response to
a question on the Eastern situation, ``We're out of there, for
sure.''
   The former Olympics organizer said he had not been in touch with
any of the parties involved, including Lorenzo, Texas Air and
bankruptcy court officials. He would not try to get in touch with
them and did not expect to hear from them, Ueberroth told a
reporter after his speech on sports issues.
   ``The deal is now dead and there are no further negotiations
because we're not prepared to turn over interim control of the
company'' to a court-appointed trustee, the Texas Air chief said.
The trustee was a condition Eastern's unions demanded before they
would accept Ueberroth's bid.
   The statements by Ueberroth and Lorenzo came a day after they
announced their deal had fallen apart, thwarting efforts to restore
Eastern to a full flight schedule.
   Lifland immediately ordered the parties in the case to explain
on Monday why he shouldn't invite other bids for Eastern that would
include major assets it owned before Lorenzo bought the airline in
1986.
   The judge's move could put pressure on Lorenzo to revive his
deal with Ueberroth.

<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,
which has been up for sale while its Arizona-based parent prepared
to file for bankruptcy protection, was seized by federal regulators
today.
   The action against the 29-branch S&amp;L was taken ``on the legal
grounds that the institution's assets had been substantially
dissipated and that it was operating in an unsafe and unsound
condition,'' according to a news release issued by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board.
   On Thursday, the American Continental Corp., the luxury resort
developer that owns Lincoln, announced in Phoenix, Ariz., it was
seeking federal bankruptcy protection.
   Martha Gravlee, a spokeswoman for the bank board, said business
was being conducted as usual at all Lincoln branches. She said
representatives from the bank board, the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. were in the
administrative offices here and in Los Angeles.
   But aside from a sign on the door, there was no noticeable
change in operations, she said.
   The FSLIC will act as conservator and the FDIC will provide a
managing agent to oversee the association's operations.
   F. Roger Clark was appointed by the bank board to serve as chief
executive officer. John H. Rousselot, named Lincoln's chairman and
chief executive officer on Tuesday, resigned those posts today.
   Rousselot led a group of investors negotiating to buy the
savings and loan, which lost $36 million in the first nine months
of 1988, but their offer was turned down because it failed to
include enough cash.
   ``Management appeared to operate Lincoln mainly for the benefit
of American Continental Corp. at the expense of the institution,
has repeatedly violated regulations relating to transactions with
affiliates, used poor underwriting and has refused to follow
supervisory directives,'' the bank board statement said.
   Lincoln Savings operates 29 branches in Southern California. The
association has $5.4 billion in assets, $5.1 billion in liabilities
and $20 million in regulatory capital, the bank board said. As of
mid-1988, it was the state's 18th-largest thrift measured by assets.
   The bank board said Lincoln's financial troubles started in
February 1984 when it was bought by American Continental.
   ``Management abandoned the thrift's traditional operations to
pursue a rapid growth strategy based on soliticing brokered
deposits to purchase real estate and to fund high risk acquisition,
development and construction loans, equity securities and junk
bonds,'' the bank board said.
   American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating said Thursday
the bank board had changed rules as his company tried to sell
Lincoln and finally demanded that the company yield control of
Lincoln to the FSLIC.

   In a sprawling warehouse-like building,
Jerry Oleksiw presides over machines that simulate sweat, test-rip
bluejeans and generally perform the industrial equivalent of trying
to gauge how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.
   Oleksiw recently recounted what he called a perplexing incident
at the J.C. Penney Co. Quality Assurance Center, set in an
industrial park on the outskirts of Dallas.
   Pink plastic bags containing ladies' imported raincoats had left
a residue of a powdery pink substance on the garments.
   Penney inspectors went to work, knowing that if any of the
30,000 coats reached customers in that condition the company's
reputation could be soiled. Their first thought was dry cleaning
but _ oops _ the cleaning chemicals damaged the water-resistant
fabric coating.
   Plan B went into action. All the coats would have to be
laundered and pressed. Little labels would have to be sewn inside
advising proper care.
   Such is a typical headache for an arbiter of quality standards.
   ``To many suppliers, this place is known as the graveyard of
many hopes,'' said Oleksiw, manager of quality assurance and
product service for J.C. Penney and a 28-year veteran of the
retailer.
   Members of his domain include white-coated laboratory
technicians who measure almost every conceivable thing that can go
wrong or wear out.
   They stretch and tug jeans to the ripping point. They plunge
boots into a sub-freezing chamber to simulate winter's worst. They
suck oil out of shoe leather, toast toast in toasters and zap food
in microwaves.
   There are devices to duplicate everyday conditions that can
cause problems for clothing, appliances and other goods. Simulated
sweat and fake pollution are just two of the hazards these testers
throw at merchandise guinea pigs.
   One machine has been designed to measure the durability of
clothing material in an unprecedented way, Oleksiw said during a
tour. It could be said to place Penney on the cutting edge of
fabric tearing.
   Elsewhere, overall-clad mechanics scrutinize gardening tools and
other gear. They've rigged a strobe light to calculate how fast the
tip of a lawn mower blade spins, because a federal safety
regulation requires blades to rotate less than 19,000 feet per
minute.
   Outside, a lush acre of fescue and Bermuda grass stands ready to
put the mowers through their paces.
   Much of the work that goes on here duplicates testing done by
manufacturers. Penney has developed a reputation in the retail
industry for being unusually scrupulous about testing, outside
analysts say.
   The quality control center is due to move to Plano, Texas, in
late 1992, when Penney's corporate offices are scheduled to leave
intermim headquarters in Dallas to take up residence at a new
429-acre site. There will be plenty of grass for lawn mowers to mow
and a pond with ducks to feed the toast.

<TEXT>
   Fears that drought conditions could persist for
another year in the Midwest drove grain and soybean futures up
sharply Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Despite the fact that spring planting of corn and soybeans has
not yet begun, bullish speculators seized controlled the futures
markets for those crops amid news reports of below-normal
springtime precipitation in some western Corn Belt states.
   ``Iowa is the real problem,'' said Cathy Leow, a grain-market
analyst in New York with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. ``During
the past month or so, they've only had about 50 percent of normal
precipitation.''
   States east of the Mississippi River have fared much better,
though, and some analysts said traders were simply looking for an
excuse to bid prices higher.
   The wheat market gained on rumors that the United States will
offer to sell the Soviet Union more wheat at subsidized prices,
although Agriculture Department officials said no such decision had
been made.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.12{ a bushel; corn was 2\ cents
to 4} cents higher with May at $2.71 a bushel; oats were 5{ cents
to 7{ cents higher with May at $1.91{ a bushel; soybeans were 4}
cents to 10 cents higher with May at $7.32{ a bushel.

   It may not have the glitz of the Eastern
Airlines saga, but the battle for control of Northwest Airlines is
every bit as bitter and much more expensive.
   A $2.6 billion offer already has been made _ and rejected _ for
NWA Inc., parent of the nation's fourth-largest airline, and
several more potential suitors are waiting in the wings amid
speculation the bidding will top $3 billion.
   While the Eastern story features such names as former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth, former defense secretary Frank
Carlucci and Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, the Northwest
cast includes oil and movie mogul Marvin Davis and Nixon White
House staffer Frederick Malek, among others.
   The primary shark circling Northwest has been Davis, the former
owner of 20th Century Fox Film Corp. who made his fortune
``wildcatting'' in oil and is worth an estimated $1.6 billion.
Davis' proposed board of directors for Northwest includes Audrey
Meadows Six, who played Alice Kramden on the Honeymooners
television show.
   Leading the charge for Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest
air carrier, is its 42-year-old Chairman Steven Rothmeier, a former
Notre Dame fullback and Army lieutenant in Vietnam who gives ground
grudgingly if at all.
   The dollars in the Northwest deal dwarf those offered for
Eastern, which is ranked seventh among air carriers. Ueberroth led
a $464 million bid to acquire Eastern from its parent Texas Air.
   While Davis and Northwest battle toe to toe, other investment
groups await an opening.
   One group, Wesray Capital Corp., was founded by former Treasury
Secretary William Simon. The other, which Northwest has said holds
4.9 percent of its 29.1 million shares, includes Gary L. Wilson, a
Walt Disney Co. executive who left Northwest's board in November;
Al Checchi, a former associate of the wealthy Bass family of Fort
Worth, Texas, and Malek, who also was a campaign adviser to
President Bush.
   The crowd eyeing Northwest and its asset-rich balance sheet have
swung the odds against Rothmeier's efforts to keep the airline
independent.
   No less an authority on hostile takeovers than Minneapolis
financier Irwin Jacobs, a friend of Rothmeier, says the airline is
``definitely in danger'' of a takeover.
   ``Northwest has a lot of honey and Marvin Davis is only the
first bee,'' said Kurt Rivard, an analyst for Minneapolis-based
Dain Bosworth Inc. ``I think there will be others.''
   The honey was cured by a string of managers who hated debt and
managed conservatively. Texas Air's Lorenzo may be legendary for
his anti-union rhetoric and action, but he can't compare to a
cost-cutting predecessor of Rothmeier named Donald Nyrop, who once
removed the doors from the stalls in the men's room because he
thought executives were spending too much time reading there.
   The stingy leadership has given Northwest ownership of 222 of
its 312 airplanes, well above the industry standard. If Northwest
is sold, the new owners could sell part of the fleet and lease it
back, earning more on the planes than Northwest originally paid for
them. The revenue could be used to repay debt incurred in a
takeover.
   Also attractive to raiders are Northwest's domination of gates
at airports in the Twin Cities and Detroit, its downtown Tokyo real
estate holdings that could fetch $500 million, its rank as the
largest cargo carrier among U.S. passenger airlines and its No. 1
position in the world's fastest-growing airline market _ the
Pacific Rim.
   Rivard said there is room to expand the airline internationally
and nationally. Domestically, Northwest is strongest in the
Midwest, where Rothmeier grew up.
   Rothmeier was raised by a German-American father and
Danish-American mother in Faribault, a town of about 17,000 some 50
miles south of Minneapolis.
   His football career at Notre Dame was cut short by a knee injury
his sophomore season and he turned to business academics with such
Spartan-like intensity that he earned the nickname ``Sparty.''
   Before going on to earn an MBA at the University of Chicago, the
6-foot, 190-pound Rothmeier commanded a supply company for the Army
in Vietnam. His first job after graduation was at Northwest.
   Not known for flair, Rothmeier chose a neighborhood steak house
in St. Paul to finalize Northwest's $884 million deal to acquire
Twin Cities rival Republic Airlines in 1986. After weathering more
than a year of labor turmoil and a spate of passenger complaints
stemming from the merger, Northwest emerged with record profits for
1988 of $135.1 million, up 31 percent from 1987.
   ``When he gets up to go to the bathroom at night he probably
makes the bed,'' William Genoese, director of the airline division
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said of Rothmeier's
need for order.
   Rothmeier's defense against Davis and the others so far has been
to adopt a ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense that Davis and
dissident shareholders are challenging in court. Northwest also has
won a temporary restraining order preventing Davis from making
``disruptive'' contacts with the three labor unions representing
34,000 of NWA's 38,000 employees.
   Rothmeier is negotiating a new contract with his 5,000 pilots,
whose loyalty will be important to thwart a takeover. A negotiating
subcommittee has been formed to discuss the creation of an employee
stock ownership program, which would act as another anti-takeover
measure by putting more stock in friendly hands.
   Meanwhile, Davis has said he will spend up to $2 million to
stage a proxy fight for control of the NWA board of director at a
May 15 meeting. If he attracts enough followers he could gain
control of the board and throw Rothmeier out.

   The stock market rallied sharply today in buying
encouraged by an apparent easing of inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 35.56 to
2,331.56 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,049 up,
400 down and 468 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March, compared with 1 percent
increases in each of the two preceding months.
   The figure came in close to advance estimates. Nevertheless,
analysts said investors were relieved that the report didn't
contain another unpleasant surprise.
   Separately, International Business Machines reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing,
in light of IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this
year weren't likely to live up to some of the most optimistic
estimates in the financial world. IBM shares gained 1~ to 111[.
   On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce
Department reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to
$10.50 billion in February and the Federal Reserve said industrial
production was unchanged in March from the month before. Both
numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates.
   General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings
for the first quarter on Thursday, rose 1| to 46~ in heavy trading.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.99 to 168.53. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.58 at 335.02.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 141.02 million shares with an
hour to go.

<HEAD>Financial Picture Rosy For Maker Of Dalkon Shield, Even In Reorganization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after A.H. Robins Co. filed for
bankruptcy court protection in the face of thousands of claims from
women who used its Dalkon Shield birth control device, the
pharmaceutical company is still in court.
   But buoyed by sales of products like Chap Stick and Robitussin
cough medicine, Robins' earnings have soared to record levels and
its stock prices have quintupled.
   The Richmond-based company reported record sales of $933.8
million in 1988, up 9 percent from a year earlier. Its operating
earnings, $184.4 million, were also up 9 percent from 1987, giving
the company net earnings of $58.4 million, or $2.42 per share,
after accounting for bankruptcy-related expenses.
   Robins' financial success during its reorganization under
bankruptcy laws shows good management and the power of brand names,
Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., financial consultants for Robins
stockholders, said Friday.
   ``The fellow buying Chap Stick doesn't really care if the parent
company is bankrupt or not,'' he said.
   Robins is currently awaiting a ruling on the appeal of its
Chapter 11 reorganization plan, which calls for it to be acquired
by American Home Products Corp. of New York for $3.2 billion.
   While most companies file for bankruptcy protection because of
debt, Robins filed under Chapter 11 in 1985 because of Dalkon
Shield litigation, Ross said. At the time of the filing, Robins had
already paid $520 million on 9,400 claims from women who used the
intrauterine device.
   Robins removed the Dalkon Shield from the market in the
mid-1970s after it was shown to cause sterility, birth defects and
other serious injuries.
   ``The whole bankruptcy was very unusual,'' Ross said. ``The
normal business was fine, stayed fine, and presumably will continue
to be fine if we ever get the deal with American Home.
   ``What's amazing is that the rest of the management didn't get
too distracted during bankruptcy,'' he said. ``The case was always
mainly about Dalkon Shield problems, and the management did a very
good job isolating those problems from the rest of the company.''
   The controversy over the Dalkon Shield and the bankruptcy court
filing apparently has not affected the company's sales, which have
climbed steadily throughout the decade.
   ``I don't really think it's been a factor,'' Robins spokesman
Roscoe E. Puckett Jr. said. ``The fact that sales have increased is
ample evidence that consumers have not had any worries about the
company's products.''
   Stockholders initially sold their shares when the company filed
for bankruptcy protection, bringing stock values as low as $5.50.
Robins stock is now worth about $26.
   American Home Products has the option to pull out of the merger
if the appeals process is not completed by this July 26, one year
after the plan was confirmed in bankruptcy court. But given that
Robins' value has continued to increase since the deal was made,
Ross said that possibility is slim.
   ``The least likely thing in the whole world is that American
Home will back out,'' he said. ``There'd be a line of other people
from Richmond to New York wanting to buy Robins.''

<HEAD>The Market Milken Built Flounders as Junk Bonds Plunge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cloud hangs over the junk-bond market, where
prices have fallen 2 percent and more in the past week ahead of a
flood of new issues and amid fears that a recession could push some
companies to the brink of default on their interest payments.
   By Friday, traders said some junk bonds had touched new lows,
falling as much as $40 to $50 per $1,000 in face value in some
cases.
   Without the magic wand of junk-bond pioneer Michael Milken, the
$180 billion market can't seem to shrug off a sense of impending
doom. Milken, who was indicted last month on 98 racketeering and
fraud charges, had the ability to calm the high-yield, high-risk
market in times of turmoil.
   ``He was the biggest factor in keeping stability in the
market,'' said one trader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
There was a feeling among dealers that Milken ``would make sure the
market wouldn't go to hell in a hand basket.''
   Much of the market's concern centers on Solomon Asset
Management, whose founder David B. Solomon has been cooperating
with the government in its investigation of Milken and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Solomon is leaving Solomon Asset, and there is concern that the
firm might be forced to sell its huge portfolio of junk bonds to
meet cash demands from nervous pension clients.
   It also is rumored that a dozen or more junk-bond fund managers
have been subpoenaed in connection with the Drexel case. ``It
doesn't take much to make life miserable,'' said Advest Inc. trader
John Moran.
   In terms of prices, ``it's a really bad market all throughout,''
he said. Some issues had strengthened slightly Friday, but even
many of the better junk bonds were unable to recoup earlier losses.
   Moran pointed to Duracell's 13{ percent bonds due in the year
2000, which were up { point from Friday's low but still down 2
points from a week ago.
   Fundamentally, traders bemoaned redemptions by junk-bond mutual
funds. Small investors started pulling out of the funds a week ago,
but nervousness spilled over to institutional portfolio managers,
who also began withdrawing funds.
   Upcoming issues of $9 billion in new junk bonds, led by $5
billion in new debt to finance the mega-buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.,
also weighed heavily on the market.
   ``People are in a cautious frame of mind and may not be a good
audience for those issues,'' one trader said. To lure reluctant
investors, underwriters might have to up yields on those issues,
which likely would depress prices of existing debt securities.
   Also dogging the market are fears of recession, which could make
it tough for companies laden with high-interest debt to make
interest payments to bondholders.
   ``Many companies with a great deal of debt may be very
vulnerable if there is a decline in business activity,'' one trader
said. ``Companies haven't been tested with all this debt before.''
   Several companies with outstanding junk bonds already are
experiencing difficulties. Analysts point to Wickes Cos. and
Interco, which they say are having trouble selling certain assets
as planned to help pay off their junk bonds. And junk bonds of
Resorts International, whose cash-flow from operations is not
sufficient to meet its interest obligations, have been weak.
   Traders also were talking about reports of an unpublished study
led by a Harvard University professor that tracked junk bonds
issued a decade ago and found the default rate was 34 percent, far
higher than other studies had shown.
   ``In the past when a study like that would come out, Mike
(Milken) did a good job of tearing it up,'' Moran said.
   Analysts were debunking the study, but none seemed to have
Milken's clout. Michael Dahood, a managing director at Smith
Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co., noted that the study only tracked a
dozen or so issues and that it was ``sensational'' to conclude that
of 100 now-outstanding issues, 34 will default.
   ``It's clear that there's going to be over time a greater loss
experience associated with below investment-grade bonds than what
historically the numbers might suggest ... but even if a company
does default, it does not necessarily mean a loss of value that the
word default conjures up,'' Dahood said.

<HEAD>Milken Agrees To Post More Than $600 Million; Judge Sets $1 Million
Bail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Junk bond dynamo Michael Milken agreed Friday to
set aside more than $600 million of his assets to guarantee payment
if he is convicted of fraud and racketeering charges in the
government's largest-ever securities prosecution.
   The former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier also was
ordered to post a $1 million bond and surrender his passport in
exchange for his freedom until an expected trial later this year
culminating Wall Street's insider trading scandals.
   Prosecutors said the agreement to place $600 million in accounts
to be monitored by the government was believed to be the largest
pretrial asset restraint ever under federal racketeering statutes.
   ``The defendants not only contest the indictment but they
seriously, expressly contest the government's theories on
forfeiture,'' Arthur L. Liman, Milken's attorney, said at the
hearing in Manhattan federal court.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood turned down a government request
that Milken post an additional $250 million in bail money, saying
the 42-year-old former broker was unlikely to flee the country
before a trial.
   In addition, Milken's brother Lowell, who also faces fraud and
racketeering charges, agreed to set aside $50 million in assets and
also was ordered to post a $1 million bond secured by other assets
by Monday.
   The Milkens left the courthouse to applause from dozens of
supporters who attended the hearing, including some wearing caps
reading ``Mike Milken: We Believe In You.'' The brothers did not
comment.
   The Milkens and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg were
charged with defrauding clients through insider trading and stock
manipulation in a 98-count indictment handed up March 29.
   The racketeering charges seek $1.85 billion in forfeitures from
each man, and they could be forced to pay double that in fines if
convicted.
   Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act,
the government could have frozen all of the defendants' assets to
ensure they wouldn't liquidate them or transfer ownership in
anticipation of a guilty verdict.
   Instead, prosecutors and defense lawyers hammered out a bond
package that requires Michael Milken to place $300 million cash in
an account to be monitored by the government and to sign a note
securing $300 million more in less liquid assets.
   He is not prohibited from making investments or otherwise
managing his money.
   Milken also will have to surrender the gains from his holdings
in Drexel _ which total 6 percent of the investment firm and are
estimated at about $100 million _ as soon as the firm's settlement
of separate civil charges with the Securities and Exchange
Commission officially takes effect.
   ``In substance, your honor, we expect the security for
forfeiture in this case will amount to $700 million,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney John K. Carroll said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the office
securities and commodities fraud section, said the restraints were
the largest for a securities case and likely the largest ever.
   ``I don't know of one with numbers like this,'' he said.
   The Drexel-SEC deal, announced Thursday, resolves a range of
charges and forces the nation's fifth-largest investment firm to
dismiss Milken, sever all business dealings with him and make him
relinquish his Drexel holdings. The firm also will be subject to
rigorous federal supervision for three years.
   Milken, who reportedly made more than $1 billion between 1983
and 1987, under the deal also is barred from transferring any
assets out of the country and must gradually sell assets to convert
the $300 million note to cash.
   Carroll sought $250 million in bail, claiming the potential
racketeering forfeiture ``gives (the Milkens) powerful incentive to
absent themselves should they choose to do so.''
   ``Should they flee to someplace where they could not be
extradited, they could live comfortably the rest of their lives,''
he told the judge.
   Liman asked Wood to free Milken without bail, saying he was a
``homebody'' who posed no threat to leave the country. If the
Milkens had sought to flee, they would have done so long ago, their
attorneys said.
   Wood said the brothers, who both have lived near Los Angeles
most of their lives, were unlikely to flee but she set the $1
million bail because of the scope of the indictment and the asset
retention package.
   The probe of Drexel and Milken is based in large part on
information by jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky, whose revelations
stunned Wall Street in 1986. Boesky has completed one year of a
three-year jail term.
   ``The one thing you can bet on is that our clients are going to
be in court,'' Liman said. ``There is nothing that will keep them
from coming to this court and confronting Boesky.''
   Newberg, who also faces a racketeering indictment in a related
case, agreed to set aside $1.6 million in assets. He has yet not
been arraigned because of a skiing injury and no bail terms were
set.
   Michael Milken has been the main target of the government's
crackdown on white-collar crime. He is widely credited with
reshaping corporate America in the 1980s through the sale of
high-yield junk bonds from Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office.

   Steel imports in February were the lowest of
any month since October 1985 and were well within the limits of the
nation's steel import quotas, two industry groups said Friday.
   The American Iron and Steel Institute, representing domestic
producers from its base in Washington, D.C., said foreign producers
are shipping less steel to the United States because they can get
higher prices elsewhere.
   February's tonnage was 1.34 million tons, down from 1.78 million
tons in January and 1.91 million tons in February 1988, the AISI
said.
   Major countries who participate in the voluntary U.S. trade
system shipped only three-quarters of the metal authorized by their
negotiated quotas, the organization said.
   U.S. producers to lobbying the Bush administration to extend the
five-year quota plan beyond its Sept. 30 expiration. Even though
their profits have surging over the last two years, the companies
say they need continued trade protection to recover fully from
massive financial losses from 1980 to 1986.
   The lightest monthly import total before February was 1.30
million tons, or 17.3 percent of the market, in October, 1985.
   The February tonnage represented 16.8 percent of the domestic
market. The quotas were intended to limit imports to about 20
percent of the market.
   The rival American Institute for Imported Steel, a New
York-based association of importers, said that February's imports
represented 14 percent of the U.S. market, not counting 188,000
tons of semi-finished products ordered by U.S. steelmakers for
further processing on their mills. The quota's goal for finished
steel is 18.5 percent.
   ``The increasing volume of semi-finished steel imports, badly
needed by domestic rolling mills themselves, continues a trend
evident since the beginning of 1988,'' AIIS President John Griffin
said in a statement.
   Both organizations interpret information supplied by the
Commerce Department.

   Continental Airlines' decision to raise some of
its fares at the start of the busy summer tourist season prompted
several of its competitors Friday to match the increases.
   Braniff Airways said it would go along with Continental's
increases, announced Thursday, in markets where the two carriers
compete. TWA and America West said they also would go along with
the higher fares, effective in late May.
   United, Delta, USAir and Southwest airlines said they had not
yet decided whether to join in the price increases while American
Airlines said it had no immediate plans to concur.
   Braniff spokesman Rick Boubelik said the increases, which apply
to so-called max saver fares, affect about 85 percent of the
Dallas-based airline's schedule.
   Cities where Braniff would hold the line on fares primarily
would be in the Midwest _ like Topeka and Salinas, Kan., on flights
both east and west, he said.
   ``We do pricing for smaller commuter markets and some of those
markets have already gotten high and we don't think they can take
another hike,'' he said.
   The Braniff increases will affect advance-purchase tickets, will
range from $20 to $80 and will begin with those placing
reservations on May 28.
   ``We'll match them,'' TWA spokesman Bob Blattner said. ``But we
won't touch business fares.''
   Continental said Thursday its increases ranged to $20 each way,
depending on the market. The boosts would not apply to first class
and full-fare coach tickets.
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker said the increases were made in
anticipation of the prime summer tourist season.
   As an example of the new price plan for tickets bought after May
26, a Continental round-trip flight from Newark to Los Angeles will
increase from $298 off-peak and $398 peak to $358 off-peak and $438
peak.
   ``Summer is the busiest time and this modest increase reflects
that demand,'' Walker said.
   However, one airline spokesman, speaking on the condition he
would not be identified, said while fares often increase during the
summer due to greater demand, the Continental increase was not
``modest'' but was the largest he'd seen in at least seven years.
He speculated it was related to the troubles of sister carrier
Eastern.
   Eastern, crippled for a month by a strike, and Continental both
are owned by Houston-based Texas Air Corp.
   ``Continental has tried to place itself as a pricing leader but
it's usually in the other direction,'' the spokesman, at a
competing carrier, said. ``Now they're trying to recoup some of
those low fares.''
   At American Airlines, spokesman Jim Brown said the carrier had
no plans to immediately follow its competition.
   ``We are still studying the proposal and it's likely we will not
make a decision for several days,'' Brown said.
   ``We have not made any decision,'' Delta spokeswoman Jackie Tate
said. ``We're just analyzing what happened.''

   Lowell Jay Milken is two years younger than his
better-known brother Michael. He never traded junk bonds, he isn't
Michael's right-hand man, he prefers the background _ and he faces
85 fewer charges of committing criminal acts.
   Friends dispute the perception of Lowell Milken as the guy in
the back room hunched over a ledger wearing a green eyeshade,
toiling away for his brother, as he was described in a 1988 book
about Milken and Drexel, ``The Predators' Ball.''
   ``Lowell has been very much his own man,'' said Martin Klein, a
New York lawyer and friend of Lowell's. ``Younger by two years but
certainly not any less creative or any less dedicated or any less
hard-working.''
   But as Michael Milken's star rose in the late 1970s and 1980s as
the architect of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield bond
department, Lowell's climbed with it, and the brothers earned
hundreds of millions of dollars.
   Now their fates are inextricably linked in the government's
massive racketeering and fraud indictment, which defense lawyers
contend includes The Other Milken only to pressure Michael into a
settlement.
   Friends describe Lowell Milken as a devoted family man,
hard-working, modest in taste and lifestyle despite his wealth,
devoted to running a charitable foundation formed four years before
the government began probing Drexel and the Milkens.
   Lowell Milken, 40, looks nothing like his brother, who stands
over 6 feet tall, wears black curly hair and has an angular face
and narrow eyes. Lowell has straight, sandy hair, and is shorter
and bespectacled. Both are described as sometimes abrasive at work.
   Like his brother, Lowell graduated from the University of
California at Berkeley in 1970, winning the business department's
top student award that eluded Michael two years earlier.
   Michael went east to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton
School, but Lowell attended the University of California at Los
Angeles law school, where he was an editor of the law review. He
joined the Los Angeles firm of Irell &amp; Manella, where he is
remembered as assiduous and creative in the fields of tax and
corporate law.
   But he left the firm in 1978 to join his brother at Drexel's
high-yield bond department in Beverly Hills, Calif., where Michael
had moved the group from the investment firm's New York
headquarters.
   While Michael ran the X-shaped trading desk, Lowell worked in an
office on the other side of the floor. Michael won fame for
reshaping American business through the issue of high-yield,
high-risk bonds; Lowell worked on other less public tasks.
   To be sure, Lowell earned less than Michael's gargantuan $1
billion in compensation from 1983-87, but his $100 million hardly
could be considered a slight. He lives in a seven-bedroom home in
Encino, Calif., with his wife and three young sons. Friends say
family photos, not expensive artwork, fill the walls of the posh
suburban home.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder and Lowell's attorney, Michael
Armstrong, said Lowell's job at Drexel involved administrative
matters such as finding and buying the junk bond headquarters; some
research duties on real estate and bankruptcy laws; and reviewing
personal investments by Drexel employees.
   ``His duties involved administrative and other duties that
simply were not involved with the matters the government has
mischaracterized in order to make its charges,'' Armstrong said.
   ``He's in this case primarily to put pressure on his brother, in
our view,'' he said.
   The 98-count indictment of the Milkens and former Drexel trader
Bruce Lee Newberg describes Lowell as ``his brother's principal
adviser in the conduct of the conspiracy.'' He also is said to be
the administrator of certain investment partnerships created by the
junk bond department.
   Lowell is charged with two counts of racketeering and 11 counts
of fraud in what prosecutors describe as a long-term scheme that
swindled clients and investors by manipulating stocks and skirting
laws during planned mergers or takeovers.
   According to the indictment, Lowell played no formal role in
making allegedly fraudulent stock transactions; in fact, he doesn't
even have a license to trade securities. But he allegedly
participated in the racketeering enterprise in other ways.
   In one count, Lowell is alleged to have joined a March 1986
telephone call regarding a $5.3 million payment with Ivan Boesky _
who provided much of the information leading to the Milken
indictment as part of a plea deal _ to settle fraudulent dealings
and then lied to accountants to cover it up.
   Lowell also is named along with Michael in the Securities and
Exchange Commission's civil suit charging them with insider trading
and securities fraud.
   Associates said Lowell Milken spends much of time administering
the Foundations of the Milken Families, which were set up in 1982
and have donated millions of dollars to city and state programs and
charities in education, human rights, and health and welfare.
   The market value of the foundation's assets grew from $43.9
million in 1985 to more than $193 million in 1987, in which it
handed out $15 million in donations. Lowell and his wife, Sandra,
set up their own charitable foundation in 1986.
   Recipients of Milken foundation money said that Lowell, like
Michael, has taken personal interest in the charities, and not
merely doled out the money.
   ``He really cares and believes in the things he's doing,'' said
Nancy Honig, president of the Quality Education Project in
California, which works with non-English speaking and disadvantaged
parents in poor areas. ``He's very clear about what he expects to
have happen.''
   Critics of the Milkens said they have played up their charitable
roles to try to counter the impression left by the government's
charges. But friends of the Milkens, including a public relations
firm they hired to speak for them, say the foundation contributed
millions before the government began its investigation.
   Said attorney Armstrong: ``It's hearts and flowers and I know
it's the old violin but that's the fact.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly lower in light
domestic dealings Friday after closing slightly higher overseas
following the release of a round of weak U.S. economic data.
   Gold prices fell sharply. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a bid of $385.00 a troy ounce for gold, down $4.10 from
Thursday's late bid.
   Two key economic reports issued Friday were in line with market
expectations, which helped contain the dollar to a narrow trading
range.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit swelled 20.9
percent to $10.5 billion, up from a revised $8.68 billion in
January. Separately, the Labor Department said wholesale prices
rose 0.4 percent in March after rising 1 percent in each of the
previous two months. Analysts had predicted a 0.5 percent rise.
   ``Initially the news seemed neutral for the market since both
were within expectations, and the dollar was stable,'' said Earl
Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago.
   But the dollar came off as traders came to the conclusion that
the data pointed to a weakening economy. ``We've had a string of
weak economic numbers now,'' Johnson said, and this simply added to
it.
   Despite the batch of data, trading was lackluster. ``The market
seemed very thin,'' said Lou Calvello, a trader at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``People don't want to speculate on what's going to happen,'' he
said.
   In Tokyo, where markets close before Europe's trading day
begins, the dollar slipped 0.35 yen to a closing 132.45. Later in
London, the dollar traded at 132.35 yen. In New York, the dollar
closed at 132.05 yen, unchanged from Thursday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the pound. One British pound
cost $1.7000, cheaper for buyers than late Thursday's $1.7010. In
New York, one pound cost $1.7055, more expensive than $1.6981 on
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.8653 West German marks, down from 1.8723;
1.6465 Swiss francs, up from 1.6433; 6.3090 French francs, down
from 6.3395; 1,368.63 Italian lire, down from 1,374.13, and 1.1861
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1870.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,
included: 1.8725 West German marks, up from 1.8720; 1.6510 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6422; 6.3350 French francs, up from 6.3335;
2.1145 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1080; 1,374.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,374.00, and 1.1875 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold prices fell. In New York, gold for current delivery settled
at $386.00 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down from
Thursday's $390.30.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $386.50 a troy
ounce, down from $388.75 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the late bid
price was $387, down from $389.15 bid late Thursday. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold rose 92 cents to close at a bid $388.46 an ounce.
   Silver for current delivery on New York's Comex settled at
$5.805 a troy ounce, down from $5.867 on Thursday. Silver was
quoted in London at a bid price of $5.89 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $5.87.

   Alcoa on Friday reported a 54 percent surge in
first-quarter profits amid strong worldwide demand for its aluminum
products.
   For the period ended March 31, the Aluminum Co. of America said
net income totaled $276 million, or $3.12 a share, up from $178.7
million, or $2.02 a share in the year-ago quarter.
   Revenue rose 25 percent to $2.6 billion, from $2.1 billion a
year ago. Aluminum shipments rose 14 percent during the period.
   Alcoa Chairman Paul O'Neill noted that the company's operations
in Australia and Brazil accounted for 44 percent of Alcoa's
first-quarter earnings due to higher prices for alumina and ingot.
   He also noted that world demand remains strong. ``Customers do
not appear to be building inventory,'' O'Neill said.
   The first-quarter earnings included a gain of $1.2 million
associated with favorable exchange rates, compared with a charge of
$21.2 million a year earlier.
   Alcoa is the world's largest producer of aluminum products.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in March, the government said Friday in a report that buoyed
spirits on Wall Street, where fears of spiraling inflation had
risen in tandem with earlier steep price increases.
   Analysts said that while last month's restrained gain in the
Producer Price Index for finished goods should allay fears that
inflation will skyrocket, it does indicate that price rises persist.
   March's 0.4 percent gain, combined with steep gains of 1.0
percent in January and February, works out to a compound annual
inflation rate of 10.2 percent for the first quarter of 1989.
   That is the largest quarterly increase in eight years and
represents a sharp escalation from the 1988 inflation rate of 4.0
percent.
   Nevertheless, the stock market, cheered by the apparent easing
in inflationary pressures, was up sharply, gaining 41.06 points to
close at 2337.06.
   The market appeared to shrug off Friday's merchandise trade
report, which showed the deficit widening 20.9 percent in February
to $10.5 billion.
   Economist Cynthia Latta of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
Mass., noted that, while the trade gap widened, the change was in
line with what analysts had expected and amounted to ``moderately
good news.''
   ``The deficit is not shrinking, but we didn't expect it to
anyway,'' she said. ``We don't see it improving this year by any
significant amount.''
   Analyst Latta said the combined effect of Friday's reports was
to suggest ``the economy is definitely slowing and inflation is a
problem but it's not necessarily a worsening problem.''
   For a year, the Federal Reserve Board has been pushing up
interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and thus dampen
inflationary pressures. Analysts are divided over whether the
central bank will be able to slow the economy just enough to check
inflation without unintentionally pushing the country into a
recession.
   Two other economic reports Friday provided signs of a possible
easing of inflationary pressures and a slowing of the economy as it
enters the seventh year of its record peacetime expansion.
   Those reports showed:
   _The operating rate for U.S. factories declined for the second
consecutive month in March, while the pace of industrial production
was flat for a second straight month as well. When factories have
excess capacity, there is less likelihood that they will have
trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, which could lead to
shortages and price increases.
   _Business inventories rose a moderate 0.5 percent in February
while sales plunged 0.9 percent, the steepest decline in more than
two years. When increases in inventories are not accompanied by
rising sales, the result could be production cutbacks that hold
down economic growth.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington consulting firm, said the
underlying rate of inflation probably remains around 4 percent
although some further sharp price increases may occur.
   ``We have a couple of bad reports to go ... but the key is that
underlying trends show no acceleration,'' he said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said officials were
``happy to see a moderating influence on inflation. It seems to
indicate the economy is slowing to the point where inflationary
fears are subsiding.''
   Analysts expected no immediate new credit-tightening from the
Fed as a result of the latest economic reports. Further information
about the price increases in March will be known Tuesday, when the
Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index for the month.
   Last month's rise in wholesale prices one stop short of retail
reflected higher costs for both food and energy, although the
increases in both categories were smaller than those registered in
the first two months of the year.
   Wholesale food prices rose 0.8 percent last month after jumping
1.2 percent in February. Last month's increase in food costs was
led by a 38.8 percent gain in prices for eggs. Vegetable costs
dropped 11.6 percent after surging 35.3 percent in February.
   Energy prices increased 0.9 percent in March following a 2.4
percent increase in the previous month. Last month's increase was
led by a 16.8 percent rise in home heating oil prices, while
gasoline costs rose 3.5 percent. Natural gas prices declined 5.4
percent due to the mild January weather and swelling stocks of
natural gas.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose
0.3 percent in March, down from a 0.6 percent increase a month
earlier.
   The overall March gain left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 112.2, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $112.20 last month. That
was up 50 cents from February and 5.6 percent above March 1988.
   Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors, said the latest report was good news but
doesn't totally put to rest worries about accelerating inflation.
   ``I don't think at all that this suggests that the inflation
watch should be terminated,'' he said.
   He pointed to steeper price increases last month at earlier
stages of production. Prices at the intermediate level, for items
such as flour and cloth, were up 0.7 percent, while the cost of
crude goods, such as cotton and wheat, rose 2.3 percent.

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Friday its first-quarter profit rose 1.8 percent excluding an
accounting change, and the stock market responded favorably to the
news.
   The gain came in spite of a chip problem that caused a delay in
shipment of mainframe computers, the biggest and most profitable
part of IBM's product line.
   IBM's stock rose $1.62{ to $110.87{ in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading, contributing to Wall Street's best day
since October.
   ``IBM's showing some great progress,'' said Don Young, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.
   The world's biggest computer company said it earned $950 million
in the three months ended March 31. IBM earned $933 million a year
earlier from normal operations, but final net income in 1988 was
$1.25 billion after inclusion of a $315 million gain from the
accounting change.
   Including the effect of the one-time gain in 1988, net income
fell 23.9 percent. The accounting change related to the treatment
of deferred taxes.
   Earnings per share were $1.61. That was up from $1.57 in 1988
before the accounting change, but down from the $2.10 recorded
after the accounting change.
   Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $12.7 billion from $12.06 billion.
   ``IBM's product and service offerings continue to grow stronger,
and we are benefiting from our improving customer partnerships as
well as our restructuring actions,'' John F. Akers, the chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement.
   ``Our expectations for 1989 remain unchanged,'' Akers said.
   Young said he was impressed that revenue grew 5.6 percent in
spite of the mainframe delivery problem and the rise in the dollar,
which makes revenue earned overseas worth less in dollars.
   IBM is successfully stretching out the life of its 4-year-old
mainframe line, while benefiting from strong sales of its new
AS-400 midrange computers and increasing acceptance of its Personal
System-2 personal computers, Young said.
   ``If not for the shipment shortfall on 3090s (mainframes) we
would have had a very superior quarter,'' said Jay Stevens, a Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. analyst.
   IBM's results have been hurt by the slow growth in demand for
big mainframe computers, which are being overtaken by speedy
personal computers and workstations.
   Sanford C. Bernstein estimates that worldwide sales of
microcomputer hardware will surpass worldwide sales of mainframe
hardware for the first time this year, $49 billion to $45 billion.
   But IBM is well-positioned to cope with the changing technology
because of its strength in PCs, Young said. ``It's hard to say this
is a mainframe company. They're the world's largest PC supplier.''

   The stock market ran up its sharpest gain in
nearly six months Friday, inspired by an apparent easing of
inflationary pressures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 41.06 to
2,337.06, for its best single-day showing since it rose 43.92
points last Oct. 20.
   The average wound up the week with a net gain of 32.26 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,074 up, 404 down and 474 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 169.78 million
shares, up from 141.59 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 201.10 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March, compared with 1 percent
increases in each of the two preceding months.
   The figure came in close to advance estimates. Nevertheless,
analysts said investors were relieved that the report didn't
contain another unpleasant surprise.
   Interest rates tumbled in the credit markets following the news.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills dropped 15 to 25 basis points,
or hundredths of a percentage point.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, rose more than $10 for each $1,000
in face value.
   Separately, International Business Machines reported
first-quarter earnings of $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the
comparable period a year ago.
   Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing,
in light of IBM's warning a few weeks ago that its results this
year weren't likely to live up to some of the most optimistic
estimates in the financial world. IBM shares gained 1| to 110~.
   On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce
Department reported that the nation's trade deficit widened to
$10.50 billion in February and the Federal Reserve said industrial
production was unchanged in March from the month before. Both
numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates.
   General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings
for the first quarter on Thursday, rose 1} to 47 in heavy trading.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Merck, up 1{ at 67\;
McDonald's, up 1] at 53}; Philip Morris, up 2[ at 119|; Coca-Cola,
up 1] at 52, and DuPont, up 2{ at 106{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $39.03 billion, or
0.85 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.35 to 168.89.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.86 to 347.76, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 4.96 at 301.36.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 3.82 to 417.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 335.82, up 2.38.

   Petroleum futures prices finished higher in
moderate trading Friday, boosted by a late-afternoon rally in
gasoline prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 40
cents to close at $20.69 a barrel, after trading as low as $20.13.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for May delivery jumped 1.21 cents
to 70.02 cents a gallon, with other months gaining less than a
penny.
   The May contract for heating oil advanced 0.77 cent to a
settlement price of 52.91 cents a gallon. Other contract months had
similar gains.
   Analysts attributed Friday's advances to internal market
influences, led by the gasoline contracts which have been rising on
a combination of seasonal demands and worries about the impact of
the Alaskan oil spill.
   ``Today was just a broad technical recovery from yesterday,''
said James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc.
   Steel said crude prices also got a belated lift from Thursday's
announcement that Saudi Arabia is continuing to cut back oil
deliveries.
   ``The market didn't respond immediately, so the news had more of
an impact today,'' he said.
   Jack Unger, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said
crude prices were up early in the session, but by midday were
trading below Thursday's $20.29 closing price.
   Late in the day, gasoline prices spurted up, ``and that brought
the whole level of the market up.''

<HEAD>Holly Shareholders Vote On Proposed Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WOODY BAIRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. shareholders voted
Friday on a proposed $1.1 billion merger with ConAgra Inc. as Holly
Farms managers continued efforts to block a takeover by rival
poultry processor Tyson Foods Inc.
   R. Lee Taylor II, chief executive officer of Holly Farms, said a
preliminary vote count was expected Monday.
   ``If the merger is turned down, then the (Holly Farms) board of
directors will have to review all of the alternatives available to
the company,'' Taylor said, declining to outline what those
alternatives might be.
   Meanwhile, ConAgra stockholders backed the merger plan by a 96
percent to 4 percent margin during a special meeting Friday in
Omaha.
   Charles M. Harper, ConAgra's chairman and chief executive
officer, said he was ``hopeful, but not optimistic'' the merger
plan would receive the required two-thirds approval of Holly Farms
shareholders.
   Holly Farms has about 5,500 stockholders with 18.1 million
shares. About 200 people attended Holly Farms' shareholder meeting,
with much of the voting conducted by proxy.
   No matter how the Holly Farms shareholders voted, the merger
proposal is expected to end up in court, but Harper said he was
confident his company's plan eventually would prevail.
   ``I would be optimistic about the outcome in normal
circumstances. But these circumstances have become abnormal _ I
might even say bizarre,'' he said.
   ``Since Tyson learned on Nov. 17 that ConAgra had the highest
and best bid, Tyson has consistently tried to undermine the merger
and ConAgra's contract rights,'' Harper said.
   Tyson, the nation's largest poultry processor, is offering $1.15
billion for the Memphis-based Holly Farms, a national leader in
fresh poultry sales.
   Taylor and Tyson president Don Tyson of Springdale, Ark.,
addressed the Holly Farms shareholders prior to the vote. Both men
promised to make good use of the stockholders' money.
   The scramble for Holly Farms began last October when Tyson
offered a cash and stock swap valued at $49.50 a share for Holly
Farms stockholders.
   Tyson's current offer is $63.50 a share in cash, and although
Holly Farms shareholders did not vote on the bid directly, Don
Tyson urged them to keep it in mind.
   The ConAgra merger, a stock swap arrangement, would be worth
about $60 a share to Holly Farms stockholders.
   ``Tyson and Holly would be a perfect fit,'' Tyson said. ``That
is why we are offering more money for your stock than anyone else.''
   In urging stockholders to approve the merger with ConAgra,
Taylor praised his company's performance and promised continued
good business.
   Holly Farms expects average earnings per share of $6.11 for 1989
through 1993 at a time when chicken prices are expected to decline,
Taylor said.
   ``We're looking at some strong performance,'' he said. ``We hope
you will keep our outlook for the future in mind.''
   Market analysts have said Holly Farms would likely retain much
of its independence with ConAgra, while the same is not assured
with Tyson.
   A Chancery Court in Delaware, dealing with a suit brought by
Tyson, is reviewing an ``asset-option agreement'' in the proposed
ConAgra-Holly Farms merger that would allow ConAgra to buy prime
Holly Farms assets should the deal fall through.
   Tyson contends the agreement is an illegal attempt to make Holly
Farms unattractive to any buyer other than ConAgra. ConAgra has
vowed to defend the agreement in court.
   Tyson has conditioned its buyout offer on the removal of the
asset agreement, and that, in turn, has led Holly Farms to portray
Tyson's bid as unassurred.
   ``We would like our stockholders to receive a clean and clear
proposal from Tyson,'' Taylor said.
   Under the asset agreement, ConAgra would be allowed to buy Holly
Farms subsidiary Harker's Inc. of LeMars, Iowa, for $148.8 million,
Holly Farms of Texas Inc. for a like amount and Holly Farms
facilities in Wilkesboro, N.C., for $127.5 million.
   Those purchases would cover some 34 percent of Holly Farms'
total assets.
   Natalie Cockrell, a Holly Farms stockholder since the 1950s,
pulled Taylor aside after the meeting to ask about the asset-option
agreement.
   ``He explain to me that it was the only way they could get the
offer from ConAgra ... But I still don't understand what will
happen if the judge says it's illegal,'' she said.
   Harry Kingston, a Holly Farms stockholder with 1,440 shares,
said he voted for the merger since the ConAgra stock swap is
non-taxable.
   ``If you take the cash money it's going to throw you in a higher
tax bracket and I can't see giving the government that much
money,'' Kingston said.
   In his pitch to Holly Farms stockholders, Tyson said his company
``has been good to its shareholders.''
   ``If you bought 100 shares of Tyson when it went public in 1963,
it would have cost you $1,050. Today, that 100 shares, through
stock splits, would be 12,000 shares worth $180,000,'' Tyson said.

<HEAD>Penny Stock Promoter Pleads Guilty In Post-Crash Fraud Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street stock promoter pleaded guilty
Friday to manipulating the prices of three over-the-counter
securities in the government's first fraud investigation emanating
from the October 1987 market crash.
   Henry Lorin, 47, president of Henlor Securities Capital Ltd.,
pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities and
mail fraud and obstructing an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   He faces a maximum 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines. A
sentencing date was not set by U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa.
   Lorin also agreed to cooperate with the government's continuing
investigation of Haas Securities Corp., a brokerage house that
collapsed nine days after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.
   Prosecutors maintain the firm's alleged scheme to artificially
raise the prices of penny stocks _ inexpensive securities traded
over the counter _ couldn't be maintained after the market drop and
share prices tumbled.
   Eugene Laff, former Haas chairman, was charged last month with
15 counts of conspiring to mainipulate the prices of the same three
stocks to increase their value in a scheme that included Lorin.
   Both cases are based on the confessions of Stanley A. Aslanian
Jr., a former Haas Securities trader and president who pleaded
guilty in January to conspiracy and agreed to cooperate with the
government. He has not been sentenced.
   Laff and Aslanian were listed as co-conspirators in the
two-count criminal information to which Lorin pleaded guilty.
   Lorin admitted to conspiring with Laff and Aslanian from July
1986 until Haas Securities went out of business to manipulate the
stock prices of Flores de New Mexico Inc., T.S. Industries Inc.,
and Big O Tires Inc.
   The information states that the three, through Haas Securities,
raised the stock prices at a time when sell orders exceeded buy
orders, and cornered the market on the stocks by accumulating
hundreds of thousands of shares in Haas inventories and setting
artificially high prices.
   ``I knew the prices were artificially high prices and helped to
maintain the prices,'' Lorin told Judge Griesa.
   Laff and Aslanian allegedly sought to create the appearance of
demand for the three stock by selling some of the stock to accounts
controlled by Lorin listed in other people's names.
   The value of the deals and profits from the manipulations have
not been listed in any court papers in the Haas Securities case.
   Lorin also admitted to giving false and misleading testimony to
the SEC in July 1987 when he denied placing stock orders for Big O
Tires.
   The investigation began when investors demanded information
about the stocks after the crash. Haas Securities allegedly was
able to sustain the prices for several days after the crash until
it filed for bankruptcy and the manipulated share prices plunged.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird said the case was the first
alleged fraud brought to light because of the crash.
   ``The things Haas was doing began before the crash but it was
the crash that resulted in the downfall of Haas and all these
things came to life,'' Baird said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Surge On Dry Weather Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fears that drought conditions will persist for another year in
the Midwest drove grain and soybean futures prices up sharply
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``The major concern is the lack of subsoil moisture,'' said
Charles Notis of Freese-Notis Weather Inc., a forecasting firm in
Des Moines, Iowa.
   ``The main concern is, will this dry weather continue, will we
have another lousy crop year?''
   On other markets, coffee futures surged; platinum gained while
gold and silver futures retreated; petroleum prices rose; and
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 4 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $4.12} a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4} cents
higher with May at $2.70} a bushel; oats were 5{ cents to 7} cents
higher with May at $1.91} a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 10
cents higher with May at $7.33 a bushel.
   The wave of drought panic that swept through the grain and
soybean pits had only the slightest foundation in reality, where
spring planting has barely begun.
   Traders cited forecasts by private meteorologists, including
Freese-Notis, for at least another week of below-normal
precipitation in the Corn Belt, and they ignored or downplayed the
National Weather Service's 30-day outlook for normal precipitation
in the Midwest.
   ``I guess they've gotten it in their minds that we're going to
have another drought,'' said Cathy Leow, a grain-market analyst
with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York. ``When you have
that kind of mentality going on, then of course the price is going
to go up.''
   Notis said the soil was driest in much of Iowa, northern
Illinois, northern Missouri, Nebraska and southern Minnesota.
   But he said there still was plenty of time for soil moisture to
improve before planting begins in earnest.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new
6-to-10-day forecast predicting normal or below-normal rainfall in
the Midwest for the second half of next week.
   Coffee futures price leaped on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange following reports that the United States, the world's
largest coffee consumer, had reversed its position at the
International Coffee Organization talks in London, indicating it
would consider a 1-year extension of the existing International
Coffee Agreement, which expires on Sept. 30.
   The United States had previously said it would not participate
in any agreement that did not address its demands for increased
availablity of high-quality arabica coffees and tighter limits on
sales by producer nations to countries that are not members of the
International Coffee Organization.
   Coffee settled 3.21 cents to 4.76 cents higher with May at
$1.3698 a pound.
   Platinum futures surged amid tight-supply fears in a
continuation of Thursday's explosive rally on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the Labor Department's report of a
smaller-than-expected 0.4 percent increase in producer prices last
month.
   Platinum settled $7.90 to $10.90 higher with July at $569.20 a
troy ounce; gold was $4.30 to $5.30 lower with June at $389.80 a
troy ounce; silver was 6.2 cents to 9.1 cents lower with May at
$5.825 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum prices recovered from Thursday's sell-off in a late
rally on the New York Merc.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents to 48 cents
higher with May at $20.69 a barrel; heating oil was .77 cent to .78
cent higher with May at 52.91 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.35 cent to 1.21 cents higher with May at 70.02 cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle and pork futures
finished mostly higher in line with firmer cash prices.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .33 cent higher with June at 71.10
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .32 cent higher with
May at 76.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .13 cent lower to .63
cent higher with June at 46.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .05 cent lower to .90 cent higher with July at 33.62 cents a
pound.

   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith
received about $3.6 million in salary and benefits last year,
placing last in terms of compensation among the chiefs of the
nation's Big Three automakers, GM said Friday.
   In its annual proxy statement, the nation's largest automaker
said Smith received $983,000 in salary, exercised $1 million in
stock options and had $68,833 contributed by the company to a
savings and stock purchase plan.
   Smith also received $1.5 million worth of stock which could be
held or liquidated during the following three years.
   The proxy statement said that in addition, Smith was paid $1
million early this year for the company's performance during the
five previous years.
   United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber and Vice President
Donald Ephlin, head of the union's GM Department, issued a joint
statement Friday afternoon criticizing the company's executive
compensation amounts.
   They said it was ``irresponsible for the ship's officers to be
seen feasting in the officer's mess when down below the waves are
pounding and the ship is taking on water.''
   Earlier this week, the nation's second-largest automaker, Ford
Motor Co., said its chairman, Donald Petersen, received $10.5
million in 1988 compensation, most of it coming in stock options.
   No. 3 Chrysler Corp. said its chairman, Lee Iacocca, was awarded
$3.7 million and future stock options from the nation's No. 3
automaker.
   The GM proxy statement also listed 1988 salaries, exercised
stock options and company stock and savings plan contributions for
four other officers: Executive Vice President F. Alan Smith,
$764,796; President Robert Stempel, $688,594; Vice Chairman Donald
Atwood, who is being considered to become deputy defense secretary,
$668,750; and Executive Vice President Lloyd Reuss, $535,000.
   The statement also contained a number of proposals presented by
shareholders to be voted on during the GM annual meeting May 19 in
Detroit, including three proposals for GM to cut its economic ties
to South Africa. The company's board of directors is recommending
votes against all three.

   Sales of Washington apples are returning to
normal levels following the recent controversy over the use of the
growth-regulating chemical Alar, an industry official said Friday.
   Out-of-state apple shipments rose 18 percent in the past week,
to 1.41 million boxes from 1.19 million the week before, said Bill
DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association.
   That's approaching the 1.56 million boxes shipped the week of
March 9, just before three consecutive weeks of sliding sales
prompted by consumer fears. Last year at this time warehouses
shipped 1.2 million boxes.
   A report released by the Natural Resources Defense Council in
late February indicated that eating apples treated with the Alar
increased cancer risk in children.
   The report was denounced by the apple industry, which said only
about 5 percent of the crop is treated with the chemical, and
several federal agencies declared apples safe to eat.
   An NRDC attorney who co-authored the Alar report Friday offered
an olive branch to growers of the nation's largest apple crop.
   ``We want to make peace with growers,'' Janet Hathaway of the
Washington, D.C.-based environmental group said. ``It would be very
useful if growers started to see we are on the same side.''
   DeWitt said exports were up 13,000 boxes to 119,000 shipped,
with 57,000 of those sent to Taiwan. Taiwan had been the most
visible foreign market to drop Washington apple imports after the
controversy started.
   Apple shipments to retailers, exporters and institutional users
are considered an accurate measure of consumer sales.
   ``I think fortunately the people have short memories and maybe
they are coming back to buying apples,'' said DeWitt, whose group
collects shipment from Washington warehouses gathered by state
government.
   ``People are beginning to realize that if there really was a
problem they'd be taking them off the market, like Chilean
grapes,'' he said.
   Prices remain soft, with the top grade of Red Delicious apples
bringing just $11 to $12 per 42-pound box, $2 to $3 below the level
prior to the Alar flap and barely above the cost of production.
   Alar is the marketing name for daminozide, which is mostly used
on red apples to improve color, firmness and increase shelf life.
Its use still is legal, but the federal Environmental Protection
Agency has proposed banning it next year.

<TEXT>
   Belgian endive, the butt of jokes during the
presidential campaign, is gaining respectability in Massachusetts,
where researchers are developing new varieties and promoters call
it the ``white gold'' of the vegetable kingdom.
   More than 150 chefs and restaurant owners gathered Thursday for
a sumptuous repast of Belgian endive with caviar, cold cream of
endive soup and braised endive with veal.
   Though he did not attend, the toast of the $15,000 party thrown
by Belgian produce shippers was Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who
appears to have nearly as devoted a following among endive sellers
as among Greek-Americans.
   ``He's certainly done a lot for us in publicity,'' said Franz
Dahlem, director of the Belgian Endive Marketing Board and host of
the leafy fete.
   When Dukakis suggested during the Iowa caucuses that
hard-pressed corn and soybean farmers try growing the yuppie
produce, it was a debacle for his Democratic presidential campaign.
   ``His farm policy is the Belgian endive,'' Dan Quayle later told
a crowd in Des Moines. ``And his defense policy is the Belgian
waffle.''
   Dukakis may have bristled, but the Belgians were grateful.
   ``It's like we say, it doesn't matter whether people tell good
things about you, just that they tell about you,'' Dahlem said in a
heavy Flemish accent.
   Indeed, these are salad days for Belgian endive, a relative of
chicory with blanched leaves, lettuce-like texture and a tangy
flavor.
   Thanks both to Dukakis and the trendiness of exotic produce in
general, U.S. sales shot up from 300 tons in 1981 to 3,000 tons
last year, according to the marketing board.
   At an average supermarket price of $2 to $3 a pound, Belgian
endive sales total about $15 million a year. But on a per capita
basis, Americans are still micro-consumers of the vegetable, eating
less than one ounce per person per year, compared to 20 pounds per
person in Belgium.
   Belgians are also the dominant growers, producing about 80
percent of the world's crop. But scientists at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst are hoping to change that.
   Their research, which began three years ago and has received
$170,000 of funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is
aimed at developing new varieties and hydroponic, or water-based,
growing techniques. It could turn a corner next year when farmers
start growing experimental batches.
   The Chinese may not be far behind. Professor Kenneth A. Corey,
who is supervising the research, has two post-doctoral students
from the People's Republic of China who are interested in taking
the crop to their homeland.
   For chefs, Belgian endive's allure is that it does not fall
apart in cooking. Farmers can charge top dollar because it requires
a labor-intensive growing process in which the white roots are
harvested and then placed in pitch-dark rooms to force the growth
of the tender leaves.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chieko Nishimura Aoki, named just last month as
chief executive officer and deputy chairman of Westin Hotels &amp;
Resorts, resigned Friday, citing health reasons.
   Mrs. Aoki had shared leadership of the 65-hotel chain with her
husband, John H. Aoki, the president and chief executive officer of
Aoki Corp., which bought the Seattle-based Westin last year.
   Larry B. Magnan, president of Westin, will succeed Mrs. Aoki,
40, as chief executive, the company said.
   Friday's announcement follows a series of top-level changes at
Westin this year.
   Magnan, 44, was appointed president in January, when he
succeeded Helmut Hoermann, who had joined Westin four months
earlier. At the time, Westin said it was undergoing an examination
of its corporate structure.
   Magnan previously was Westin's senior vice president for
technical services and had managed hotels in Asia and Colorado.
   In an interview two weeks ago, Mrs. Aoki declined to say much
about the executive changes. ``Compared to other types of
acquisitions of companies, our turnover was very, very low, because
normally they change the whole officers,'' she said.
   She noted that the promotions of Magnan and others were from
within the chain, ``so it's not putting the house down and creating
utterly new things.''
   Hiroyuki Tsuru, spokesman for Aoki Corp. in Seattle, said Mrs.
Aoki stepped down because of health problems aggravated by her new
role in the company.
   Tsuru declined to comment beyond that statement, and would not
elaborate on the health problems.
   Karen Amrhine, spokeswoman for Westin in New York, also declined
to give details of the health difficulties. Ms. Amrhine said she
did not know what Mrs. Aoki's future plans would be.
   Mrs. Aoki came to Westin after serving as president of Cesar
Park Hotels Group, another Aoki subsidiary. Ms. Amrhine said Mrs.
Aoki would not be further involved in the Caesar Park management.
   Aoki Corp., is a Japanese construction and transportation
company with sales of about $3 billion last year. Aoki bought
Westin in 1988 for $1.5 billion as previous owner Allegis Corp.
retrenched into United Airlines.
   While John Aoki took over as Westin chairman with the retirement
of longtime chief Harry Mullikin, Mrs. Aoki was in charge of the
chain's operation.
   Mrs. Aoki, a native of Fukuoka, Japan, is a naturalized
Brazilian. A corporate attorney specializing in labor law, with a
degree in business administration, she met Aoki while he was
working at the Japanese consulate in Brazil. They married 12 years
ago.
   Aoki Corp. bought Brazil's Caesar Park Hotels as an investment,
and Mrs. Aoki became its sales and marketing director in the early
1980s. She became executive vice president in 1983 and president in
1986, helping the chain grow to nine hotels, including New York's
Algonquin and Los Angeles' Beverly Wilshire.

   General Motors Corp. on Friday increased
incentives on some of its Chevrolet, Buick, Oldsmobile and Pontiac
cars even as the company pushed its new low-financing program.
   The automaker boosted or added cash rebates on a variety of cars
and light trucks and offered options of financing as low as 2.9
percent on some vehicles.
   On March 30, GM announced a new incentive program, in effect
until June 5, that essentially matched a program announced the day
before by Ford Motor Co. Both companies offered interest rates as
low as 2.9 percent for two-year loans.
   On April 3, Chrysler Corp. announced an incentive package
featuring interest-free financing for two-year loans.

   A creditor payback plan proposed by the bankrupt
Hunt brothers amounts to ``blackmail,'' an attorney said Friday
during a hearing in the bankruptcy petitions of the two former
billionaires.
   Willam Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt filed bankruptcy last
September after Minpeco SA, a Peruvian mining company, won a $134.6
million judgment against them. Minpeco claimed the brothers had
conspired to commit fraud during their silver dealings in 1979 and
1980.
   The brothers also face multimillion dollar tax claims by the
Internal Revenue Service.
   Details of the brothers' plan remained under seal until late
Friday, but were discussed during a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Harold Abramson.
   Under the plan, the Hunt brothers' largest creditor, the IRS
would receive half of the proceeds from liquidation of assets over
and above those set aside for the brothers.
   The brothers each would retain 10 percent of the proceeds from
the sale of their assets. In Bunker Hunt's case, that 10 percent is
estimated to be $15 million. The brothers would also keep
possession of their Dallas homes and ``life'' interests in trusts
left to them by their father, H.L. Hunt. Their other holdings would
be liquidated and the proceeds split among about 4,000 creditors
each.
   But major creditors, including the IRS, Minpeco and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. of New York _ which has a $36
million claim _ opposed the Hunts' plan.
   The IRS' claim, about $900 million against Bunker Hunt and $300
million against his brother, is the main sticking point in debt
settlement negotiations.
   A trial currently is scheduled for July on the IRS' contention
that each brother owes $300 million in taxes from 1982.
   ``They proposed blackmail to creditors,'' said Barbara Howse, a
Minpeco attorney, criticizing the part of the Hunts' plan that
includes proceeding to trial with the 1982 tax case.
   Should the brothers lose that case, it would wipe out virtually
all their assets, leaving nothing for other creditors, which
include silver speculators and people who say they lost money in
land deals involving the brothers.
   The IRS, Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover together have
proposed an outline of liquidation plan they would like other
creditors to consider.
   The major difference between the two plans, according to
Manufacturers Hanover attorney Hugh Ray, involve who is in charge
of the liquidation.
   ``The real creditors don't want the Hunts managing this,'' Ray
said. ``The question is, `Who do you want running this? The
creditors who are owed the money or those who ran it into the
ground.'
   ``We may not be sage. We may not be wise, but we can do better
than this,'' Ray said.
   The Hunts asked Abramson to extend the period that they alone
may negotiate with creditors.

<HEAD>Data Suggests Inflationary Pressures Subsiding</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Saturday PMs</HEAD>

   The stock and bond markets rallied impressively after the
government released economic data suggesting that inflationary
pressures are subsiding and the economy is taking a breather from
the brisk pace of the last few years.
   On Wall Street, the stock market turned in its best showing in
nearly five months. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 41.06
points Friday to 2,337.06, for its best single-day gain since it
rose 43.92 points last Oct. 20.
   In the credit markets, bonds scored their biggest gains since
early December. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue jumped
$12.50 for every $1,000 in face amount, as its yield dropped to
9.03 percent from 9.15 percent late Thursday. Short-term interest
rates were also sharply lower.
   The government reported Friday that wholesale prices climbed
more slowly in March than in the previous two months, while the
operating rate at the nation's factories slowed, business
inventories rose and sales plunged.
   At the same time, the government said the nation's trade deficit
widened in to $10.5 billion in February from a rtevised $8.98
billion in January.
   The reports were either better or consistent with expectations.
   ``What we have here is what (Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan) Greenspan and the Fed have been working for _ an economic
pause that refreshes as opposed to a severe slowdown or
recession,'' said Thomas F. Carpenter, economist with ASB Capital
Management in Washington.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.4 percent in March. The index, which measures
inflation at the wholesale level, had increased 1 percent in each
of the two previous months.
   Also in March, the nation's factories operated at an 84 percent
rate, 0.2 percent slower than in February and the second
consecutive monthly decline, according to the Federal Reserve Board.
   The Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.5
percent in February while sales plunged 0.9 percent in their
steepest decline in more than two years.
   With the exception of the trade figure, analysts said the
reports pointed to a slowdown in the growth of economic activity
and fit in with other evidence that the economy is easing off the
vigorous pace of recent years, including lackluster retail sales
and a slackening of employment growth in March.
   ``We expect a slowdown in the economy and possibly a resurgence
in growth later this year. At that point people will be concerned
about the economy again. But now, with the economy slowdown being
confirmed with retail sales and other numbers, the pendulum is
beginning to swing back to a more balanced view and less
inflationary fears,'' said Marshall B. Front, economist at the
Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp;
Farnham.
   Carpenter cautioned, however, that it is ``premature to get on
the bandwagon and suggest that the economy is going to slow in a
meaningful way.'' With most of the weakness concentrated in the
automobile sector, the slowdown could be temporary as dealers add
incentives during the second quarter to help boost sales, he said.
   But Friday's data could fuel a reversal in interest rates,
predicted Peter Greenbaum, bond market analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``How much lower depends on what happens with
the dollar.'' Greenbaum said he expects the yield on the
government's long-term bond to decline to 8.75 percent by the end
of the year, from a peak of about 9.5 percent in the first quarter.
   In other economic news, a Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
survey showed that fixed-rate home mortgages are currently
averaging 11.11 percent, up from 11.07 percent last week.
   On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 9.41 percent this week, up from 9.39
percent the week before, Freddie Mac said.

   American Airlines, fresh from a recent airplane
buying binge and already casting an eye toward troubled Eastern
Airlines, found itself the target of informational pickets at
numerous airports Friday as union members began clamoring for a
piece of the company's profits.
   ``American has become the biggest carrier in the country. They
are the most profitable in the country and the workers, `we've
worked hard; you've made a lot of money off our labor and we want
to share in that profit,''' said Jim Gannon, a spokesman for the
Transport Workers Union, which represents 22,000 of American's
67,000 employees.
   Union officials said a ``couple of hundred'' pickets were at
American's home terminal at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport, while a similar number were at O'Hare in Chicago. Small
numbers were reported at other airports where American operates.
   The pickets did not disrupt the airline's flight schedule.
   In New York, meanwhile, about 100 mechanics and ground service
workers demanding a new contract picketed American's terminal at
Kennedy International Airport, Port Authority police said.
   The union's contract with American was up for renewal on March
1, but a proposed new pact was turned down by a 12,143-to-5,140
vote last month.
   The company and union will sit down next week with federal
mediator Harry Bickford in an attempt to resolve the dispute, which
centers on wage scales and health benefits.
   If no agreement is reached, and Bickford declares an impasse,
there is then a 30-day cooling off period, after which the union
can strike and the company impose new contract conditions.
   Ed Koziatek, TWU's international vice president for American,
said he was not optimistic the mediation will be successful.
   ``We spent eight weeks in direct negotiations, and the parties
are locked up on some real major concerns,'' he said.
   ``We're frankly puzzled'' at the union's decision to picket,
American spokeswoman Mary O'Neal said.
   The rejected contract was worth $610 million over four years,
``more than anyone has offered, for example, to buy Eastern
Airlines,'' Ms. O'Neal said.
   It guaranteed raises for all employees, ranging from about 28
percent over four years to about 100 percent during the contract.
``That seems pretty generous,'' she said.
   Gannon said the union objected to the wage scale, under which it
takes new employees 12 years to reach top pay. The union wants that
reduced to five years.
   Also at issue, he said, is the company's plan to have employees
pay $10 per person _ and up to $30 per family _ toward health
insurance each month. The company previously has paid the entire
premium.
   Ms. O'Neal said the company was asking only for employees to pay
a part of increases. ``With rising health costs, the change is
inevitable for all employees at American,'' she said.
   Fort Worth-based American just completed its most profitable
year ever, with parent company AMR Corp. posting 1988 net income of
$476.8 million, a 140.3 percent increase from 1987 and 37.9 percent
higher than the previous record of $345.8 million in 1985.
   American President Robert Crandall said in Miami Thursday his
airline was considering buying some routes belonging to Eastern
Airlines, which has filed for bankruptcy after a machinists strike
essentially grounded the carrier.
   Last month, American also announced two plane purchases: a $3.09
billion deal with Dutch manufacturer Fokker for 75 F-100 planes and
options for another 75; and an approximately $2 billion purchase of
25 Boeing 757s and 10 Boeing 767s.
   On Feb. 7, American announced another $7 billion deal to buy
eight McDonnell Douglas Corp. jets with options for another 142.
