<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee said Monday it has
changed its outside counsel in a case involving Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   The committee hired former federal prosecutor Henry Schuelke, a
Washington attorney, to replace Robert Bennett, who is still
handling two other cases for the committee.
   The committee announcement said Bennett, also of Washington,
advised the panel last week that his law firm's diverse practice
could lead to an appearance of conflict of interest in the D'Amato
case. Details of how such an appearance could arise were not given.
   Mark Green, D'Amato's election opponent in 1986, has filed a
complaint with the committee accusing him of breaking Senate rules
in the HUD scandal and other matters. D'Amato has denied any
improprieties.
   Schuelke will take over Bennett's role of helping the committee
determine whether to proceed with a formal investigation, a review
that is expected to take several months.
   Bennett is still the committee's outside counsel in conducting a
similar review in a case involving five senators who interceded
with banking regulators on behalf of a contributor whose savings
and loan was collapsing.
   Bennett also is the committee's counsel in an investigation of a
book deal by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.

   Universal Studios is feasting on the record
$27.8 million earned by ``Back to the Future Part II'' in its
Thanksgiving-weekend debut.
   The sequel to the 1985 hit knocked another sequel out of the
record books as the highest-grossing Thanksgiving release,
according to figures released Monday. ``Rocky IV'' grossed $20
million during the Friday to Sunday period in 1985.
   For the long holiday weekend that began Wednesday, ``Back to the
Future Part II'' collected $43 million and set single-day admission
records on Wednesday and Thursday, with grosses exceeding $7.2
million each day.
   But the strong opening of the film starring Michael J. Fox and
directed by Robert Zemeckis failed to surpass the all-time
three-day opening record, set this year by ``Batman'' with $42.7
million, according to Entertainment Data Inc. and Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   Total movie house revenues for autumn hit a record of $832
million, up 24 percent from last fall. Thanksgiving business for
the top 10 was more than $78 million, up 50 percent from 1988.
   Eddie Murphy's gangster film ``Harlem Nights'' dropped to second
place with ticket sales of $11.1 million from Friday through
Sunday, down 31 percent from the previous weekend.
   Disney's animated hit ``The Little Mermaid'' rode a rising tide
of popularity to surge 39 percent last weekend, making $8.4 million
to come in third.
   The baby-rearing comedy ``Look Who's Talking'' earned $7.9
million to claim fourth place. In fifth was the ensemble drama
``Steel Magnolias,'' which collected $7.1 million.
   In sixth was another animated film, ``All Dogs Go to Heaven,''
grossing $5 million. The Christmas-themed reindeer movie
``Prancer'' came in seventh with $4.1 million.
   In eighth place was the sentimental drama ``Dad'' on $2.9
million, followed by ``The Bear'' with $2.3 million and ``Crimes
and Misdemeanors'' with $1.5 million.
   Here are the top movies for Friday through Sunday as tallied by
Entertainment Data and Exhibitor Relations. Figures are based on a
combination of actual box-office receipts and studio projections
where actual figures are not immediately available.
   1. ``Back to the Future Part II,'' Universal, $27.8 million
weekend gross, 1,865 screens, $14,925 per screen, $43 million total
gross, one week in release.
   2. ``Harlem Nights,'' Paramount, $11.1 million, 2,180 screens,
$5,108 per screen, $34.9 million, two weeks.
   3. ``The Little Mermaid,'' Disney, $8.4 million, 999 screens,
$8,393 per screen, $16.8 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Look Who's Talking,'' Tri-Star, $7.9 million, 1,651
screens, $4,771 per screen, $96.6 million, seven weeks.

<TEXT>
   CBS, trying to raise the low ratings of its
late-night and morning shows, is putting a veteran sports producer
with ``The Pat Sajak Show'' and two new reporters on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Sajak's talk show will be getting Michael Weisman, an NBC Sports
producer for 15 years, as co-executive producer. Sajak is the other
executive producer. Weisman has won 10 Emmy awards for his sports
telecasts.
   The reporters joining ``CBS This Morning'' are Steve Kmetko, of
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles, and Wayne Freedman, formerly of KRON-TV in
San Francisco. Kmetko will report on the entertainment industry but
continue at KCBS. Freedman, who will be a features reporter for the
CBS show, will be based here.
   CBS announced the staff changes Monday. A spokesman also said
that director Peter Bogdanovich, who had reviewed videocassettes of
classic films and interviewed film figures for CBS' morning show,
is leaving the program.
   The show, co-anchored by Harry Smith and Kathleen Sullivan, is a
distant third in ratings against NBC's top-rated ``Today'' show and
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Sajak's show also has struggled in the ratings since its Jan. 9
debut. It began as a 90-minute program, but on Oct. 30 was cut back
to an hour each night.

   Randall E. Wise had it all _ a Harvard
M.B.A., a profitable computer software company. But he sold his
firm to follow a dream, a dream to one day supply contact lenses to
all the world's egg-laying chickens.
   Wise's red contact lenses are already on 100,000 chickens
nationwide, and his company, Animalens Inc., is growing.
   Oh, sure, people laughed at first. ``We'd talk to investors.
They'd say: `Sounds neat. Good luck,''' Wise recalls.
   But while Wise is willing to joke a little about his enterprise,
he's all business when it comes to discussing the future, which he
says looks sunny side up.
   Before writing Wise off as a cuckoo, understand that there is a
sound idea behind his scheme. Chickens become positively mellow
when they see the world through rose-tinted glasses _ or better
yet, fire-engine red contact lenses.
   Scientists aren't sure why, but a rosy outlook eliminates the
pecking order among chickens, which normally tend to be pretty
ornery critters. Red-eyed birds spend less time fighting and more
time laying eggs. They also eat less.
   According to Wise's calculations, that translates into an annual
savings of at least 50 cents a chicken, or 2.5 cents per dozen
eggs. With 1.2 billion laying chickens multiplied by the 20 dozen
eggs each yields a year, the savings could be $600 million.
   With such benefits, Wise is sure farmers will soon flock to buy
his contact lenses, which go for a modest 20 cents a pair, or 15
cents if bought in bulk. The hard lenses are put in place in
seconds by holding the bird's head steady. They stay in place for
the life of the bird, or about a year.
   ``The challenge is to go out and sell the product, especially
when it's new and different,'' Wise says. ``This certainly falls
into the category of being new and different.''
   The idea for the lenses goes back to Wise's childhood on the
chicken farm his father managed in northern California in the early
1960s.
   Wise's dad, Irvin, tried to produce lenses for chickens after a
salesman told him about a farm where chickens afflicted with
cataracts behaved better than those with normal sight.
   ``But the technology didn't exist at the time for the lens to
work,'' explains Wise, 41. ``The early lenses blinded the
chickens.''
   The elder Wise's fledgling company folded. His son went off to
college, worked in the shipping industry for a time and then
founded a computer software firm in Boston eight years ago that
prospered.
   But the chickens and the lenses were still on his mind. Three
years ago he sold his company for several million dollars and set
out to pursue his dream.
   ``I got out of computers because of this,'' Wise says. ``And I
still don't miss computers. I've believed in this for a long time.''
   Not that everything has flown smoothly since jumping from
computer software to chicken eyewear.
   The lenses had to be painstakingly designed so they wouldn't
distort the chickens' vision or irritate their eyes. Wise keeps a
jar in his office filled with hundreds of pairs of failed test
lenses that looks like a container of jelly beans.
   ``I look at that and I think `That's all behind us,''' Wise
says. ``We already know a lot someone else would have to figure
out.''
   Eventually, a usable lens was developed. Wise contracted with
several small plants around Massachusetts to produce the lenses,
and field tests were conducted on farms around the country.
   Now, Wise says, the testing is over and it's time for his dream
to fly.
   ``I'm very confident,'' Wise says from his firm's small suite of
offices in this affluent Boston suburb. ``1990 is going to be the
inflection point for us, when this really takes off.''

   South Carolina school principal Ben Nesbit
became suspicious when two students who had been suspended for
illicit drug use passed a drug test with little trouble.
   ``We found out a couple of weeks ago that there's a chemical
that washes drugs out of the system,'' said Nesbit, whose school _
Spring Valley High of Columbia, S.C. _ has received national
acclaim for its drug-fighting efforts. ``The students use it full
time: washing out their systems and being tested, all the time
being high.''
   The street name of the chemical is ``Golden Seal,'' said
District of Columbia teacher Leroy Lewis Jr., explaining the
``herb'' also is popular with students in the nation's capital.
   This latest student scam is proof that the war on drugs in
schools is serious and must be waged in a no-nonsense but flexible
manner, Lewis said.
   ``Kids recognize all the problems of the system,'' said Lewis, a
U.S. government teacher at Spingarn Senior High School. ``They know
how to circumvent us better than we know how to plan.''
   The battle to keep the nation's youngsters away from drugs has
evolved from a mere ``Just Say No'' slogan, devised by former First
Lady Nancy Reagan, to a threat by the Bush administration to end
federal aid to schools, colleges and universities tat fail to
document tough policies against illegal drug use.
   The tougher approach reflects the nation's growing concern with
drug abuse. Statistics say that 5 percent of high school seniors
drink daily and more than 60,000 adolescents ages 12 and 13 have
tried cocaine.
   ``Young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction
and the damage by addiction can be more permanent,'' said Doug Hall
of the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
   The government is expected to spend some $500 million under the
drug education program this fiscal year, about $180 million more
than the year that ended Sept. 30. In 1986, only $3 million was
budgeted for drug education.
   Almost all high schools and 87 percent of elementary schools
offer some sort of anti-drug lessons. The new national drug
strategy says school-based prevention programs should be reinforced
by tough policies on use, possession and distribution of drugs.
   Schools are trying a variety of approaches with no clear trend
emerging. Success is hard to determine since so many of the
approaches are new.
   In Texas, football players are tested. Illinois and Delaware
laws allow spot searches of students, and Delaware plans to use
drug-sniffing dogs in the schools.
   Jefferson County, Ky., schools notify police of every campus
drug incident, suspend students for six to 10 days for drug
possession or use, and transfer repeat offenders. The Pittsburgh
Board of Education has decided any student convicted of trafficking
in or possessing drugs, on or off school property, will be subject
to expulsion.
   ``Drug Free Zone'' signs surround public and private schools in
Prince Georges' County, Md., warning that anyone found possessing
or distributing drugs within 1,000 feet of a school yard faces
strict penalties, ranging from 5 to 40 years in prison.
   Education officials estimate as many as 25 states have some sort
of drug-free zone programs or laws.
   ``We see more expulsions and suspensions for use because it's
against the law,'' said James Better, staff director of the
Education Department's Drug-Free Schools Recognition Program. ``But
most schools have referral and re-entry programs.''
   At the local level, Education Department officials estimate 73
percent of America's 16,490 school districts have written policies
against substance abuse. Of these, more than 90 percent involve
notification of parents and or police, suspension or counseling.
   Most major education groups avoid advocating specific drug
policies for schools. At most they offer general guidelines, like
those jointly developed by the American Association of School
Administrators, the National Association of School Nurses and the
National Education Association.
   ``We have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the
locals, so national groups avoid doing the same thing,'' said Lew
Armistead of the National Association of Secondary School
Principals.
   Hall, vice president of the National Parents' Resource Institute
for Drug Education in Atlanta, said: ``We don't believe in dealing
with these people as criminals. You really can't incarcerate your
way out of a drug problem.''
   Hall pointed to statistics that say ``school buildings or
campuses are one of the least popular places'' for students to use
or distribute drugs. Also, he said, students tend to use drugs more
at night and on weekends.
   ``PRIDE supports treatment on demand,'' said Hall. ``But the
problem is it's difficult to draw the line on whether the school is
responsible or the parents.''
   Nesbit insisted: ``It is a school problem because they can't
learn when they are stoned. They can't learn when they're dead.
They can't learn when they're in the hospital. We're going to be
paying for their rehabilitation forever and ever because so many
people are hooked.''
   Nesbit said his drug-fighting efforts encompass more grassroots
approaches of ``sending out letters of complaints to local liquor
stores that sell alcohol to minors'' to encouraging temporary
suspensions for drug use and automatic expulsion for drug sales.
   In addition to the District of Columbia's citywide policies,
Lewis offers early-morning tutoring for students who want help with
school work and ``to talk about what's going on with them, with
somebody they want to trust.''
   Jenlane Gee, a teacher from Modesto, Calif. _ recognized along
with Nesbit and Lewis as among the nation's best teachers and
principals _ complained that the government's drug-fighting efforts
have ignored elementary schools.
   Gee, who teaches third graders at Christine Sipherd School, said
just as much emphasis should be focused on the elementary schools
because studies show that children usually decide by the third to
fifth grade whether to experiment with drugs.
   Nesbit added that simply talking _ or acting _ tough won't stem
student drug use.
   ``I think there's a hard line'' emerging in the schools, he
said. ``But there's no comprehensive policy that helps kids to make
good decisions about their future, their bodies and their values.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev broke the mold of dour,
intransigent Soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world
stage, and he's been surprising now-wary Western counterparts ever
since his 1985 summit with Ronald Reagan.
   Based on his past performance, there's every reason to believe
that the 58-year-old Gorbachev might spring a surprise on President
Bush when the two meet off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3 _ so much so that
White House officials say extensive preparations are under way to
prepare the American president for anything that might be thrown at
him.
   Gorbachev's reform policies in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe have been surprising enough to Americans. His style leans to
the unexpected, as well.
   When Gorbachev and Reagan posed for pictures at the start of
their meeting in Geneva four years ago, the American president kept
mum, heeding his advisers' counsel not to take a chance on spoiling
the atmosphere of his first U.S.-Soviet summit with an offhand
remark.
   The Russian showed no such caution.
   When a reporter told Gorbachev he had been described by a fellow
Soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth,
Gorbachev replied: ``I'm still using my own teeth, but as to the
substance of your question, both the president and I have good
grounds to believe we can have a good talk.''
   Later the same day, after his tete-a-tete with Reagan stretched
well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule, the Soviet leader
broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides. ``I think we will
have a good relationship,'' he said.
   At the last snap summit, in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, the
United States went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty
reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Gorbachev instead
proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories.
   Reagan took him up on the challenge, and the two men engaged in
what was later described as history's highest-stakes poker game,
seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another
until they stumbled over the last chip: Reagan's beloved Star Wars
plan.
   The American refused to concede; the Soviet insisted it was all
or nothing. And nothing it was.
   Bush's advisers have let it be known the new U.S. president will
not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off
Malta.
   But as recently as last May, when Secretary of State James A.
Baker III went to Moscow expecting to set a date for the next
U.S.-Soviet summit, Gorbachev caught the new foreign policy chief
off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional
forces in Europe.
   The initiative broke a years-old logjam over how to count and
reduce the two sides' non-nuclear ground and air forces in Europe.
But it embarrassed Baker, who was unprepared for such a move, and
gave Gorbachev a public relations coup.
   Bush, facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in
developing a policy toward the Soviet Union, recovered at the end
of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a
NATO summit in Brussels.
   But six weeks later, Gorbachev pulled another trick out of his
hat.
   As the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies
gathered in Paris for their annual economic summit, they received a
letter from Gorbachev appealing for entry to the world economic
community.
   After decades of cold war and economic rivalry, the Soviet chief
wrote that his effort to restructure the Soviet economic and
society ``is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and
entire participation in the world economy.''
   His letter instantly became the central focus of the summit
talks.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two deadliest weeks of the
10-year-old civil war have served only to set the stage for more
bloodletting.
   The battle of San Salvador _ at least the first one _ is over.
The huge rebel offensive that began Nov. 11 failed to achieve its
principal objective of persuading the government to make
significant concessions in the quest for a negotiated solution.
   Indeed, with the administration claiming victory and demanding
what amounts to the rebels' surrender, and the insurgents promising
to finish off ``the mortally wounded fascist beast,'' Salvadorans
can only expect weeks or months more of warfare of an intensity
unseen since early 1981, when the rebels' first ``final offensive''
failed.
   ``This battle against ARENA is a battle that cannot turn back, a
battle to sweep fascism once and for all from our country,'' the
rebel clandestine Radio Venceremos said late last week. ARENA is
the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, the governing party.
   ``They (the guerrillas) tried, and they lost,'' President
Alfredo Cristiani said, proclaiming the military defeat of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The government contends its forces killed or wounded a third of
the rebel army, estimated at about 7,000 full-time combatants. Most
foreign journalists who spent day after day in the combat zones
doubt the official claim that more than 1,000 guerrillas were
killed.
   The figure appears inconsistent with the relatively few dead
guerrillas seen by reporters who daily compared notes on what they
saw where and when.
   Cristiani says the decimation suffered by guerrilla forces has
been so telling that they will be capable from now on of only
``terrorist'' actions.
   The contention is suspect, as the president, the defense
minister and every colonel who went on record in the months prior
to the spectacular push said the same thing: that insurgent
capacity had been reduced to isolated terrorist activity.
   Cristiani acknowledged in an interview after the fighting waned
last week that the guerrillas ``are doing some things that look
more like regrouping than withdrawing.''
   Radio Vencermos on Friday referred to the 10-day concerted
assault on the capital and several provincial cities as ``the first
period of offensive,'' implying that others are in the offing.
   The war began in late 1979, but its roots go back decades.
   El Salvador is the smallest country on the Western Hemisphere's
mainland. With 5 million people in an area the size of
Massachusetts, it is also the most densely populated.
   The consolidation of landholdings by relatively recent immigrant
families _ not of the centuries-old Indian-Spanish mix that makes
up more than 90 percent of the population _ disenfranchized
hundreds of thousands of peasants who raised subsistence crops on
collectively held village lands. Landless peasants became migrant
peons who went seasonally from the coffee harvest to picking cotton
to cutting cane _ the workforce of an economy that was almost
completely dependent on the export of those three products.
   The agricultural export economy made vast fortunes for a tiny
elite. The rich have mansions on their plantations, sumptuous homes
in the capital's posh western sector and houses or apartments in
Miami, New York or Los Angeles. They tune in to U.S. television
stations with their satellite dishes and send their children to
U.S. universities while the two-thirds of the population lives in
dire poverty.
   Peasants and workers organized widely in the 1970s. By the end
of the decade, left-leaning federations demanding profound
structural reform to more equitably distribute wealth were
regularly putting tens of thousands of people in the street. They
probably constituted, if counted together, a plurality of
Salvadorans.
   The growing left threatened the privileged, who reacted
ferociously. About 30,000 people _ most of them real or perceived
leftists _ are estimated to have been slain by government troops or
right-wing death squads between 1979 and 1984, when such murders
began to decline.
   Repression combined with the vast majority's manifest lack of
economic opportunity to create a fertile field for revolutionary
harvest.
   The government and its U.S. patron _ Washington has provided El
Salvador $4 billion in aid this decade _ contend a fledgling
democracy is on its feet. The left says intimidation, persecution
and murder still await those who avow social change.
   On Nov. 16, armed men broke into the Central American University
campus residence of six Jesuit priests and educators who had been
labeled subversive ideologues by the radical right. The gunmen
killed the priests, their housekeeper and her teen-age daughter.
   Other Jesuits at the school say witnesses saw army troops enter
the residence before the shots rang out.
   The government and guerrillas sat down in Mexico in September to
discuss peace for the first time in two years. They met again in
Costa Rica last month, but the sessions were strained and fruitless.
   Cristiani last week urged the rebels to admit their defeat,
``come to their senses, lay down their arms and incorporate
themselves in the democratic process.''
   Asked if that scenario was realistic, Cristiani said: ``It may
not sound realistic to the FMLN.''
   The Rev. Ignacio Martin-Baro _ one of the slain priests _ was
vice-rector of the university and head of its prestigious polling
institute. His recent surveys showed that the majority of
Salvadorans were personally uncommitted to the program of either
the government or the insurgency.
   The only cause that commanded majority support was peace.

   A priest who is Russian Orthodox by
necessity, not choice, stood before his congregation in the
Cathedral of the Transfiguration on a recent Sunday and proclaimed
allegiance to Pope John Paul II.
   Yaroslav Chukhny's words echoed from Rome to Moscow, long
competitors for the souls of Eastern Europe. They are certain to
reverberate back to the Vatican when Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday
becomes the first Soviet leader to meet a Roman Catholic pontiff.
   The 35-year-old priest took the boldest step yet in a revolt
against the forced consolidation of the small Ukrainian Catholic
Church into the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946.
   After his proclamation, he said the Ukrainian church ``does
exist and it has legalized itself.''
   Chukhny never considered himself Russian Orthodox. He attended a
Russian Orthodox seminary in Moscow because it was the only path to
the priesthood.
   Ukrainian Catholics who kept the faith underground for two
generations see the Gorbachev trip as a sign they will regain legal
status as a separate denomination.
   With that will come a chance to reclaim confiscated churches and
property, including Chukhny's cathedral, and an element of national
identity in an area that was part of Poland before World War II.
   ``I think Gorbachev is a cunning guy, and he wouldn't go to meet
the pope with nothing in his pockets,'' said Miroslav Soltys, a
44-year-old communications engineer and Ukrainian Catholic.
``Behind two or three locked doors, I think the church already has
been legalized.''
   In the Soviet Union, religious groups need government approval.
Ukrainian Catholicism, with an estimated 2.5 to 5 million followers
in the Western Ukraine, does not have it, and many followers have
been fined or imprisoned.
   Expressing the Russian Orthodox Church's resistance to
legalization, Metropolitan Filaret of Kiev said the Ukrainian
church had been a ``source of national, social and religious
oppression'' during its nearly 400 years.
   After Chukhny's proclamation, Soltys and other believers took
over the Cathedral of the Transfiguration, where Ukrainian
Catholics are dominant in the congregation.
   In his liturgy for Sunday, Oct. 29, the priest acknowledged the
spiritual leadership of John Paul II and prayed for him instead of
Patriarch Pimen, head of the Russian Orthodox Church.
   He recalled in an interview later: ``I told them I had gone over
to the Greek Catholic Church. I said, `Forgive me if you don't
agree, but I don't feel any allegiance to the Russian Church.'''
   Greek Catholic is another name for the Ukrainian church.
   Chukhny said the religious tenets of the Russian Orthodox and
Ukrainian Catholic churches are much the same, and the only real
differences are in language and the ultimate superior.
   Believers keep a constant vigil inside the Kiev cathedral to
prevent the Russian Patriarchate from taking it back. On a Sunday
in November, several thousand people pressed into the church and
about 100 more strained to hear the service from the steps.
   Russian Orthodox officials accused Ukrainian Catholics of taking
over by force and have revoked Chukhny's right to preach in the
Russian Church, but they have not tried to recover the green-domed
cathedral built just before the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
   ``I'm a religious person,'' said the bearded young priest.
``I've never been interested in politics, but what I did has taken
on a political coloring.''
   Ukrainian Catholicism has been colored by politics ever since a
16th century agreement gave the Vatican supremacy over believers in
the Ukrainian and Byelorussian territory then controlled by Poland.
   The church kept the ancient Orthodox ritual, and even its name
reflects centuries of turmoil. It is known variously as the Greek
Catholic, Ukrainian Catholic and Uniate Church.
   After being separated from the rest of the Ukraine for nearly
600 years, the Lvov area was reunited with it by force half a
century ago. After Germany attacked Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, Josef
Stalin sent the Red Army into eastern Poland.
   After the war, the areas were incorporated into the Soviet
Union. The Ukrainian Catholic Church, accused of collaborating with
the Nazis, was merged with the Orthodox Church, which took over its
property and buildings.
   Among the priests who led the merger program, which Soviet and
Russian Orthodox officials insist was voluntary, was Gavriil
Kostelnik, pastor of the same Cathedral of the Transfiguration.
   Priests who refused to switch were sent to prison camps, where
many died. Ivan Gel, who now leads the lay Committee to Support the
Ukrainian Catholic Church, was imprisoned 18 years for nationalist
and human rights activities and for supporting the church.
   Resistance to Soviet rule in the Western Ukraine was such that
bands of anti-Soviet guerrillas operated in the woods and mountains
until the mid-1950s.
   Gel was released in January 1987, and as Gorbachev's reforms
loosened control of religion, Ukrainian Catholics became bolder.
   Services in private apartments were replaced by open rallies and
demonstrations, but organizers often were fined or jailed.
   Ukrainian Catholics have reopened as many as 40 churches, and
Gel said other priests are following Chukhny's lead.
   In Gel's life, as in the region, the church is part of the
ethnic sentiment of a people dominated at various times over the
centuries by Russians, Swedes, Poles, Lithuanians, Austrians and
Hungarians.
   Ukrainians credit the church with keeping their language alive
and accuse the Russian Orthodox Church of being cowed by whatever
power rules Russia.
   ``We need a return to freedom of religion in the Soviet Union as
a principle right of a citizen in a democratic country,'' Gel said.
``Renewal of our nation, renewal of our church, is part of the
process of decolonization of our people.''
   ``A people without a church cannot be sovereign.'' Gel said.
   He sees the Ukrainian church playing the role of the Roman
Catholic Church in Poland _ a center of resistance to Communist
rule.
   That could worry the Kremlin, which faces demands for greater
autonomy or outright independence in regions along its western
border.
   As for the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Filaret wrote
to the Moscow News: ``You don't need to be clairvoyant to
understand that the restoration of the former Uniate Church will
lead to religious and political struggle.''

   Early election returns Monday showed
opposition parties forging ahead of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
Congress Party, threatening the family dynasty that has dominated
independent India.
   Reports by government-run television said the Congress Party was
leading in more races than any single opposition party but was
falling short of enough seats in Parliament to form the next
government without entering a coalition.
   The television network said that final results in 246 of the 524
contests gave the Congress party 103 seats while the National Front
coalition, the major opposition force, and a fundamentalist Hindu
party and two communist parties captured 112. Smaller parties and
independent candidates won the other seats.
   ``The Congress Party is no longer going to be the majority in
the next government,'' the television commentator said. ``Who will
form the next government and who will be the next prime minister is
going to take some time to determine.''
   The election campaign that began in October was the most violent
since India gained its independence from Britain in 1947. Balloting
in the vast nation was staggered over three days _ Wednesday,
Friday and Sunday _ and it was uncertain when final official
results would be reported.
   Millions of ballots were ruled invalid by the election
commission, including those cast in 18 percent of the precincts in
Gandhi's home district of Amethi, and it ordered that new elections
be held Monday.
   By the time voting ended in India's 25 states and seven federal
territories, at least 137 people including six candidates had been
killed in election-related violence since Wednesday.
   The election commission ruled there was widespread
ballot-rigging, voter intimidation and murderous assaults and
ordered new elections Monday in one-fifth of the country's 590,000
polling booths.
   The election was seen as a referendum on Gandhi's leadership
since he assumed power in 1984 amid hopes he could lead India
toward a new age.
   While the Congress Party was expected to sweep the southern
states, it appeared to be in serious trouble in the north, its
traditional stronghold.
   Congress still could emerge as the single largest party, making
it the likely choice to try to form the next government of the
world's largest democracy. But it would be forced into an uneasy
alliance with Hindu fundamentalists or the communists.
   The National Front coalition, led by former Gandhi ally
Vishwanath Pratap Singh, was running in second place.
   It was followed by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party,
or Indian People's Party and the India-Marxist Communist Party.
   At stake in the elections were 524 seats in the 543-seat Lok
Sabha, or House of the People, the policy-making lower house of
Parliament that will choose the next prime minister. Voting was
postponed in several districts because of incomplete voter lists or
candidates' deaths and the other 19 seats will be determined in
later elections.
   Opinion polls had indicated Gandhi's Congress Party would win
from 170 to 220 seats, far short of the 267 needed for a majority.
The party 415 seats in the December 1984 elections that propelled
Gandhi to power.
   The Congress Party accepted ``under protest'' the Election
Commission's order for new balloting in Amethi, said party
spokesman Anand Sharma. He denied the allegations of fraud and said
they were a plot to embarrass Ghandi who has represented the
district since 1980.
   But the decision dealt a stunning blow to Gandhi, who had been
expected to easily win re-election to Parliament. Although voter
fraud is common in Indian politics, never has a re-vote been
ordered in the prime minister's own backyard.
   Gandhi's position already had been weakend by criticism of his
leadership and reports of high-level corruption in his government.
   Defeat for Gandhi, the grandson of Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru and son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, could herald the end
of the dynasty that has governed India for all but 29 months since
it became independent.
   The election will be won or lost in the Hindi heartland, the
northern states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh,
Haryana and Bihar, which together control more than half the seats
in the Lok Sabha.
   Neither Congress nor the opposition adopted a platform calling
for major changes in India's domestic or foreign policy. Gandhi's
leadership became the main issue of a bitter campaign that claimed
at least 182 lives since it began in October.
   The 45-year-old prime minister portrayed the election as a
simple choice between stability and chaos. Only the Congress Party
_ the party of his mother and his grandfather _ could provide
economic improvement and fight the ethnic and religious tensions
threatening the country's unity, he said.
   The National Front, a coalition of five parties with regional,
religious and ideological differences, capitalized on accusations
of high-level corruption and ineptitude and promised honest and
efficient leadership.
   Gandhi was propelled to power hours after his mother's
assassination Oct. 31, 1984. He promised to clean up India's
notoriously corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy, liberalize the
economy and initiate reforms that would attack poverty and
illiteracy and prepare India for the 21st century.
   But the initial aura inspired by the youthful Gandhi, a
Cambridge-educated former airline pilot, faded as allegations of
corruption dogged his friends, his party and his government.

   Fifty years ago, the Soviet Union
invaded Finland and met the fierce ``ghost army'' of white-clad ski
troops whose gallant fight in a hopeless cause was admired around
the world.
   The Finns lost the 105-day war to their huge neighbor, but
memories of their courage helped make their independence secure
after World War II.
   ``The Russians were badly organized and stuck out like sore
thumbs against the white snow in their dark uniforms,'' said Capt.
Toivo Ahjopalo, who was a junior artillery officer on the shores of
Lake Ladoga on the Karelian isthmus.
   Although the Red Army soldiers were well equipped, their
strategy and planning were poor. Ahjopalo said his artillery unit
of two 57mm guns killed 1,600 Soviets in 48 hours.
   ``It was too easy ... almost shameful to kill them,'' he said.
``The Russians kept coming at us in straight lines and our two guns
picked them off like flies. The frozen lake was awash with blood.''
   A new Finnish movie called ``The Winter War'' will open
Thursday, the anniversary of the outbreak of what may have been the
coldest war in history. Several books and articles on the war also
have been published recently.
   In the era of glasnost, Soviet historians have increased their
casualty figures from fewer than 50,000 Soviet soldiers killed to
74,000, with more than 200,000 wounded.
   The official Finnish estimate of total Soviet casualties is
nearly 1 million, a number also hinted at in the memoirs of Nikita
S. Khrushchev, the former Soviet leader.
   Finland, a nation of 3.7 million in 1939, suffered 22,000
soldiers killed and 43,000 wounded.
   On Nov. 26, 1939, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov
accused Finnish troops of shooting across the border near Mainila,
a village in southeastern Finland. The Finns denied it, and Soviet
historians now say Josef Stalin used the incident as a pretext to
invade Finland four days later.
   ``It looks very likely that Stalin ordered the shots to be fired
by his own troops,'' said Alexander Dongarov, a Soviet Foreign
Ministry researcher. ``The Soviets were worried about developments
in Europe and a possible German attack on their territory through
Finland. Besides, there was great anti-Russian feeling and mistrust
in Finland at the time.''
   Dongarov spoke with The Associated Press during a visit to
Helsinki.
   The Winter War was fought in temperatures as low as minus 49
degrees. The severe cold caused frostbite and hallucinations that
forced guard duty tours to be reduced from two hours to 30 minutes.
   Adolf Hitler had occupied Austria in 1938, and in secret
negotiations with the Finns, Stalin demanded the right to build
fortifications in the Gulf of Finland to protect Leningrad. Finland
rejected that and other Soviet demands as violations of its
sovereignty.
   Negotiations broke down after 18 months. The Finns still did not
believe Stalin would attack, but Field Marshal Carl Gustaf
Mannerheim mobilized more than 180,000 men near the border for what
was called ``refresher training.''
   ``I was literally admiring the sky above Helsinki when suddenly,
totally unexpectedly, Russian planes broke through the clouds and
dropped their bombs,'' said Paul Sjoblom, who covered the war for
The Associated Press.
   Minutes later, he scrambled out of a bomb shelter and found the
mangled remains of his bicycle in the street.
   When the Finns had fought for three months against the Red Army,
which sent in 450,000 soldiers at the start of the war, they were
suffering from lack of reserves and ammunition.
   After a Soviet offensive in March 1940, Mannerheim rejected an
offer of aid from the Western powers as ``too little too late,''
and recommended a negotiated peace.
   A treaty was signed March 12 that forced Finland to cede large
areas of eastern Karelia to the Soviets. More than 400,000
Karelians had to be evacuated.
   ``The Winter War demonstrated once again that, when a great
power is faced by a small nation whose only goal is to survive,
calculations of strength cannot be based on pure arithmetic,''
wrote Max Jacobson, a former Finnish ambassador and statesman.
   ``In the vast drama of World War II, it was but a short episode.
Finland, like a recalcitrant pawn, refused to move to the square
assigned to it by those who controlled the chessboard. ... Finally,
it had to submit to fate.''
   Fifteen months after the battle ended, Finland went to war with
the Soviet Union again, on the side of Germany.

   Actor Richard Gere has been devoting a lot of
time in recent years to his Buddhist beliefs. But that didn't stop
him from portraying a couple of old-fashioned bad guys in upcoming
films.
   The 40-year-old actor, who has done little acting since his
acclaimed performance in 1982's ``An Officer and a Gentleman,''
says in the current issue of Fame magazine that he has been
supporting the cause of Tibetans, who have been under Chinese
occupation since 1950.
   ``They are a gentle, spiritual people who have been systemically
murdered by the Chinese,'' said Gere, who, along with composer
Philip Glass, founded the Tibet House for Himalayan exiles in New
York two years ago.
   Gere, best known for his sex-symbol roles in films such as
``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' and ``American Gigolo,'' is a student
of the exiled Dalai Lama, this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner.
   ``His Holiness has been through so much,'' he says. ``His
strength is ... He's just unbelievable.''
   Gere himself, however, will soon be seen playing characters with
a less-than-holy nature.
   In the soon-to-be-released ``Internal Affairs,'' Gere stars as
an amoral career cop opposite Andy Garcia's good guy investigator.
And March is the scheduled release for ``3,000,'' in which Gere
stars as a ruthless Wall Street speculator.

two-week exchange program on treatment of the disease.
   The Soviets, including physicians, treatment center directors,
recovering alcoholics and celebrities, were met Sunday by Mrs. Ford

   ``Alcoholism is the most treatable of our primary diseases,''
Mrs. Ford told her guests. ``I hope that this conference will lead

discussions will become even broader in scope.''
   A spokeswoman for the Soviet-American Conference on Alcoholism,

   A judge has given permission to the guardians of
Sir Rudolf Bing to sell his possessions to pay for the care of the
aged and ailing former head of the Metropolitan Opera.
   State Judge Eve Preminger gave the order Friday after Bing's
court appointed guardian, Harvey Korn, told her that Bing will have
no more than $11,000 in cash by the end of the year.
   Korn said Bing's monthly expenses are about $14,500, for upkeep
and pocket money, and his income from social security, his pension
from the Met, and other sources total about $8,500 a month.
   Bing, 87, has Alzheimer's disease and lives in the Hebrew Home
for the Aged.
   Three years ago, Bing's net worth was estimated at $900,000, but
much of that was depleted by legal and security expenses required
for his protection from former psychiatric patient Carroll
Douglass, 49, whom he married in 1987.
   On Sept. 5, state Judge Carmen Ciparick annulled the marriage
after finding that Bing suffered serious mental impairment because
of Alzheimer's disease, and therefore was not capable of agreeing
to a marriage contract.

   The ``14th Occasional Pasadena Doo Dah
Parade,'' a tacky ensemble of floats such as the Hibachi ``grill
team'' and a outhouse with Santa's wife inside, weaved through the
streets before 50,000 people.
   Unlike the traditional Rose Parade, Sunday's Doo Dah boasted few
rules, no queen and no formal judging, and featured marchers
carrying briefcases, lawn furniture and snow shovels.
   The highlight was the Great Zsa Zsa Drill Team, in which several
women and one burly man, all dressed as Zsa Zsa Gabor, re-created
the actress' infamous policeman-slapping incident with men dressed
as Beverly Hills motorcycle officers.
   Other favorites were The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Drool Team of
the Living Dead Dishonor Guard, featuring marchers with live,
running chain saws _ with chains removed. There were several Exxon
Valdez floats, including one operated by roller skaters who kept
falling down and yelling, ``The reef, the reef.''
   The Barbecue &amp; Hibachi Marching Grill Team members banged on
barbecues with metal tongs behind a drum major with an ice chest
around his neck.
   Replicas of bathroom fixtures were popular among entrants,
including a Santa Claus who drove a bike equipped with an outhouse,
whose door would open to expose a compromised Mrs. Claus.
   The Doo Dah parade was first held Jan. 1, 1978, when the Rose
Parade was switched to Jan. 2 to avoid being held on a Sunday. Last
year's event was the 12th parade, creating some confusion over why
this year's was dubbed the 14th.
   ``Well, this is the `occasional' parade, and 40 or so of my
friends celebrated Doo Dah 13 with a pub crawl along the parade
route on New Year's Day, while I was out of town,'' self-proclaimed
Doo Dah Czar Peter Apanel explained.

   The cultivators of 200-pound radishes
and watermelons the size of small deer will get official
recognition soon, thanks to new registry for green-thumbed growers.
   ``Most of the calls I get have been, `Is this the biggest
pumpkin, tomato or whatever?''' said Jim Stephens, a specialist
with the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural
Sciences. ``People will call up and say they have a 200-pound
radish and ask if it is a record, and we'd have to say we didn't
know.''
   But Stephens has developed rules and procedures for harvesting
and measuring about 30 varieties of vegetables grown in the state.
Already, records have been established with a 10-pound cabbage, a
16-pound, 8-ounce cantaloupe, and a 146-pound watermelon.
   One of the secrets of growing a super vegetable is to extend its
growing season, and that will make most vegetables tough and
stringy. The texture of a giant radish, for instance, resembles
wood pulp.
   Clyde Bumgardner, a retired air conditioning expert in Levy
County, was credited with producing Florida's champion watermelon
this past summer.
   ``That's the one that has the official record, but the year
before I had one that was 170 pounds,'' said Bumgardner, 72. ``The
world record is 270 pounds so I've got a way to go.''

<HEAD>General Says His Ouster From Panama Was Political</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of the U.S. Southern Command
says the Bush administration ousted him from his post in Panama for
political reasons because he opposed U.S. policies in that country.
   ``I believe the policy was flawed,'' Gen. Fred Woerner said in
an interview in which he described the administration's goals as
simplistic and short-sighted.
   ``The specific language was, the president decided it was time
for a change,'' Woerner said in describing how Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney told him in July that he was being removed. ``And
then when I said I was entitled to more of an explanation ... I was
told it had nothing to do with performance but (was for) political
reasons.''
   Woerner's contention contradicts the Pentagon's denial in July
when it announced he was being replaced.
   Woerner, a longtime Latin American hand who retired from the
Army earlier this month, left his post as head of the command just
days before the failed Oct. 3 coup attempt to oust Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   During the attempted overthrow, U.S. troops blocked two roads in
Panama, spoke with the rebel leaders and watched the firefights
from their hillside vantage point. Several congressional leaders
contended later that the United States should have stepped in to
oust Noriega.
   Woerner, who generally opposes U.S. troop intervention, added,
``The president, I think, in his handling of the last major event,
the failed coup, demonstrated his lack of willingness to commit
troops.''
   The American government started pushing for Noriega's ouster
after a series of demonstrations in 1987. The move heightened when
the Panamanian general was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in
the United States in 1988.
   President Bush has repeatedly said he is not giving up on
efforts to get Noriega out of office. The president also has said
he considers Noriega to be the problem _ not the Panama Defense
Forces that Noriega heads _ and that if Noriega is forced out and
free elections are held, the country will have ``instant improved
relations'' with the United States.
   Woerner said that in the Bush administration's policy, ``There
was a lot of heat generated but not necessarily sound policy or
strategy to support U.S. interests.'' He said the goals of the Bush
administration were short-term: get Noriega out and restore
democracy.
   ``You link those two together and you have what the
administration believed was an easy objective,'' Woerner said.
   ``That means you put your policy ... in the hands of Noriega. If
he stays your policy fails. If he goes, you succeed,'' Woerner
said. ``I know Noriega; I didn't want to put the success or failure
in his hands.''
   The U.S. policy assumed Noriega's ouster would remove the
problem, but Woerner contended it only would create ``a promotion
for the next thug.''
   The general said his remarks were seen as being soft on Noriega.
   ``It is very difficult to speak out on Panama in a position
contrary to the administration's without appearing to be soft on
Noriega,'' he said.
   Noriega does have to be deposed for democracy to succeed, he
conceded, but added the U.S. policy cannot stop there. Woerner said
he sought a plan calling for an internal opposition group, strong
U.S. support for that group and international condemnation of the
situation.
   ``I do not believe a problem of this magnitude can be solved by
external forces in the United States,'' he said. ``And we can't
just transfer a democratic ideal or objective.''
   ``I said we were greatly underestimating Noriega's staying
power. And that was not a popular position to take,'' Woerner said.
   The answer is not military intervention, he said, adding: ``We
could intervene and take out Noriega. That's the easy thing. It's
getting out and leaving something behind to say those American
military men that lost their lives changed Panama for the better.''

<HEAD>New England School Graduates Its First Male Nanny</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Another cultural stereotype will
self-destruct when the New England School for Nannies graduates its
first male nanny.
   Aaron Stack, 18, of Westfield, will complete the 3{-month
program Dec. 15.
   Stack's sense of humor helped him in a similar situation _ in
high school when he was the only male in a preschool child care
class.
   Now, it has helped him parry the jests of friends who can't help
asking if he wants to be Mary Poppins.
   After graduating from Westfield High School last spring, Stack
didn't want to go to college, and ruled out military service.
Instead, he opted for the nanny program, which he learned about
during a job fair.
   ``The military keeps calling me, but I say, `I'm going to be a
nanny, not a Marine,''' he said.
   The $300 a week, plus room and board that he could earn as a
live-in baby sitter, appealed to him.
   ``My pay goes into my pocket,'' he said. Besides, ``I love kids.
They're awesome.''
   Arthur Lord, vice president and director of admissions for the
New England School for Nannies, said about 250 women have graduated
from the 5-year-old school. Stack will be its first male graduate.
   ``We're quite proud of him. He's holding up the grades and he
won't be hard to place,'' Lord said.
   ``It raises some eyebrows when men come into a field like this,
like male nurse,'' Lord added. ``We've tried males before, they're
uncomfortable about being the only male in the class. Aaron's going
to break the door open.''
   Stack said the program focuses on the business side of being a
nanny as well as teaching child care and child psychology. To his
surprise, a nanny can expect to have health insurance and taxes
paid by the employer.
   He acknowledges that since men have traditionally avoided such
occupations, some people question his motivation. But Stack said
he's determined to be treated as a professional care giver.
   ``Hey, it's practice,'' said Stack, who wants to have children
some day. ``A nanny is a practice parent.''

   An opposition presidential candidate
led in early returns Monday after the governing party's hopeful
conceded defeat.
   Jorge Batlle, candidate of the governing Colorado Party, said
Sunday night before official returns were released that he had lost
the race to Luis Lacalle of the National Party.
   Both parties are center-right and both candidates have promised
to trim down an atrophied welfare state in this small South
American country of 2.9 million people.
   ``According to the information available, the future president
will be Sen. Lacalle, to whom I extend my most sincere
congratulations and best wishes for success in his term,'' said
Batlle, whose name is pronounced BAHT-lee.
   Lacalle said he would issue a public statement on Monday, but
acknowledged that he had received congratulatory calls from
President Julio M. Sanguinetti and Liber Seregni, presidential
candidate for the leftist Broad Front.
   The Interior Ministry, issuing the first official returns
shortly after midnight that results from 152 of the 8,493 voting
stations gave 10,170 votes or 39 percent to the National Party,
8,040 votes or 30 percent to the Colorado Party and 3,547 votes or
13 percent to the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist parties.
   Equipos Consultores, a respected independent polling agency,
projected the National Party received 38 percent of the total vote,
compared to 31 percent for the Colorados. Equipos did not state how
many votes its projection was based on.
   The leftist coalition Broad Front tallied 22 percent of the vote
nationwide, according to Equipos, and the front's cndidate for
mayor of the capital Montevideo, Marxist doctor Tabare Vazquez, won
that coveted post.
   Batlle acknowledged that the ``trend indicates a majority for
the Broad Front'' in Montevideo. ``That trend is irreversible,'' he
said. ``The next mayor of Montevideo will be Tabare Vazquez.''
   At stake were the presidency, the vice presidency, the posts of
30 senators and 99 deputies, and governments in 19 provinces.
   A win for the National Party would be the first time it took
power since 1967 and only the third time this century.
   Uruguayans voting to replace Sanguinetti and both houses of
congress said their main concern was invigorating an economy that
has been in decline for three decades.
   ``Things aren't going to change if politics don't take a turn
and politicians look for something different,'' said Luis Suarez, a
63-year-old retiree.
   ``When we look at the outside world, there have been tremendous
advances,'' said Marcos Larghero, 47, a graphic designer. ``The
opposite has occurred here. We deteriorate a little bit each year.''
   Election officials anticipated a turnout of 90 percent or better
of the 2.32 million Uruguayans eligible to vote. Radio stations
reported that 21 percent had voted by 11 a.m.
   In the last elections in 1984, the main issue was who could best
lead Uruguay back to democracy after a 12-year military regime that
trampled human rights, stifled political opposition and ran the
economy to the ground.
   Batlle's great-uncle, Jose Batlle y Ordonez, forged modern
Uruguay during his presidencies in 1903-07 and 1911-15. Using huge
surpluses from beef and grain exports, Batlle y Ordonez established
the 8-hour work day, a minimum wage, retirement pensions and paid
vacations.
   Batlle's father, Luis Batlle Berres, used reserves built up
during World War II to promote local industry by blocking imports
during his 1947-51 presidency. He also expanded social programs.
   Today, public education through college is free. The state
provides mortgages and insurance as well as pensions, runs the
banking system and employs 270,000 Uruguayans, or about one-quarter
of the work force.
   However, salaries are so low that teachers, bus drivers and
others frequently go on strike, retirees can hardly live on their
pensions, and the quality of public services has declined. Teachers
earn about 84,000 pesos ($110) a month.
   The gross national product, now $8 billion, and real wages
recovered modestly under Sanguinetti. But inflation, now at 82.5
percent, did not. Unemployment, at 14 percent in 1985, is down to 9
percent.
   Lacalle and Batlle pledged to reduce inflation, balance the
national budget, sell gold reserves and pay off some of Uruguay's
$6.3 billion foreign debt, and sell inefficient public companies.
They also pledged to open the economy, encourage competition
through deregulation, and restrict the right of organized labor to
strike.
   Lacalle took the lead in public opinion surveys, analysts said,
partly because he convinced voters he would seek solutions
gradually on the basis of negotiation, not right away or by force.
   Uruguay's aging, politically conservative population includes
650,000 retirees. A majority of voters are 40 years old or more.
   Lacalle, a 48-year-old attorney and senator and a member of a
prominent political family, pledged to form a coalition government
and said he would offer Cabinet posts to leaders of other parties.
   The new president takes office March 1, 1990, and congress and
the departmental governments begin Feb. 15.

<HEAD>Food Prices Expected to Rise Again Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Food prices will go up again in 1990 but farm
exports probably won't. Crop production may equal or exceed this
year's output, but that will depend on the weather.
   It's forecasting time at the Agriculture Department when
hundreds of bureaucrats, economists, consultants, researchers,
commodity traders, bankers, food processors and even a few farmers
gather to hear the latest predictions.
   Many foreign governments, notably the Soviet Union, Japan and
members of the European Economic Community also watch the annual
conference for tidbits that may help their agricultural trade
fortunes.
   The department's 66th annual conference, Outlook '90, will run
from noon Tuesday to noon Thursday. During that time, dozens of
general sessions and individual meetings will cover the overall
international and U.S. domestic situation, plus separate sessions
for various commodities and other topics.
   Much of the outlook for 1990 already has been described in
general terms by USDA analysts in recent reports.
   For example, consumer food prices, which rose 4.1 percent in
1988, probably climbed about 6 percent this year, the sharpest
annual increase since 1981. Analysts have been saying the 1990
increase won't be that sharp _ if there is normal weather.
   The USDA also reports that agricultural exports, which provide
much of the financial base for farmers, did well in 1989, reaching
almost $40 billion, the most since the record $43.8 billion in 1981.
   But exports in 1990? Department analysts have been saying those
will be down because of lower prices and reduced volumes expected
for some key commodities.
   The net cash income of farmers rose to record levels in recent
years, peaking at $59.9 billion in 1988. This is the money farmers
have left over in a calendar year after deducting cash expenses
from gross cash income.
   However, 1989 net cash income will drop to a range of $52
billion to $57 billion, according to USDA economists. That reflects
greater expenses from more cropland being put back into production
this year, along with sharp declines in government payments.
   The outlook for 1990 farm income will depend greatly on national
and international weather and crop situations, particularly for
wheat, soybeans and feed grains. Livestock expansion _ or
contraction _ also will reflect crops and markets.
   Thus, the conference will attempt to fill in many of the gaps
concerning the supply and demand for commodities in the coming
year. But those aren't the only concerns.
   ``Conditions affecting farmers and rural Americans will be an
important focus of Outlook '90, with such topics as farm finance,
new action on rural development, rural transportation policy, the
well-being of rural families and children, and housing for older
farm workers,'' organizers said.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter will keynote the
conference on Tuesday afternoon and will participate in discussions
on the federal budget, national economy and the financial health of
agriculture.
   James R. Donald, chairman of the department's world agricultural
outlook board, will review the U.S. and world outlook for
agriculture.
   Various commodity briefings and discussions are scheduled for
Wednesday, along with rural development and forestry. Another
highlight will be USDA's formal 1990 outlook for food prices by
economist Ralph R. Parlett Jr.
   The concluding meetings on Thursday morning will include
sessions on dairy and farm financial prospects, and global trade
policies. Yeutter is scheduled to lead discussions on U.S. trade
negotiations and how those are expected to affect American farmers.

   Japan, for years the No. 1 overseas buyer of
U.S. grain and other farm commodities, is turning into a lucrative
market for pet food.
   An Agriculture Department report says Japanese pet food imports
increased five-fold from 1984 to 1988, reaching a value of $173.8
million. And the report by the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service says the trend is expected to continue.
   The leading foreign suppliers are Australia, with a 38 percent
market share; Thailand, 27 percent; and the United States, 24
percent.
   Overall, including domestic production, pet food sales in Japan
are expected to double in the next five years, the report said.
   Total dog food sales were valued at $467.3 million in 1987; cat
food, $359.3 million; fish food, $34.3 million; and bird seed, $9.8
million.
   ``Many new pet food products, especially upscale gourmet treats,
have been introduced,'' the report said. ``The rapidly
strengthening yen makes imports more price-competitive.''
   Another factor has been the promotion by foreign pet food
manufacturers, who have set up subsidiaries in Japan. Also, Japan
eliminated all tariffs on pet food imports on April 1, 1989.
   Japanese pet owners traditionally relied on leftovers to feed
their pets and have started buying products specifically made for
pets only in recent years.
   ``By 1987, 30 percent of the pet owners in Tokyo had purchased
pet food,'' the report said. ``This compares with more than 70
percent in the United States and most European countries.''

<HEAD>HUD Chief May Seek Line-Item Veto Test Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may get his chance to test
whether courts will approve a line-item veto, if Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp has his way.
   Kemp said Sunday he may ask the president to test a line-item
veto on housing projects earmarked for funding by Congress over the
administration's opposition.
   ``I am going to do everything I can to make sure that Congress
does not earmark monies, including asking the president to perhaps
test on a line-item veto those programs which heretofore have just
been shoved down our throat by Congress,'' Kemp said on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
   The chief of the Department of Housing and Urban Development did
not say which specific programs would be involved.
   On Oct. 24, Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House
was seeking legislation on which Bush could exercise a line-item
veto _ and then allow the courts to decide whether he acted legally.
   Fitzwater told reporters at that time: ``We are looking for a
vehicle that might be a suitable test case, but at this point we
don't have one.''
   Congressional Democrats contend that under the Constitution,
presidents do not have line-item veto authority, and they have
vowed to challenge any such move by Bush in court.
   Kemp was questioned about a $4.2 billion housing initiative
which Bush announced on Nov. 10. Unlike congressional housing
proposals, the president's program _ called Home Ownership
Opportunities for People Everywhere, or HOPE _ would not provide
any money for new construction of low-income housing.
   Kemp said the administration plan concentrates on promoting
ownership because ``at the heart of the American experience and
dream is the desire to own a home and we're going to do everything
we can to reorganize HUD with an eye on giving people that chance.''
   The Bush initiative would provide $728 million for the homeless
_ to be equally matched by states, local government or private
groups _ for housing and support services such as social and mental
health programs.
   HUD officials have estimated that the United States currently
has about 600,000 homeless people.

<HEAD>Gray Names DeConcini and Cranston in Lincoln S&amp;L Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sens. Dennis DeConcini and Alan Cranston bear
more blame than three other senators accused with them of
improperly intervening with regulators in connection with the
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, a former top regulator says.
   Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, on Sunday insisted that the five lawmakers improperly
pressured him as a favor to Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
``They were asking me to withdraw a regulation for their friend,''
Gray said. ``I said, `We're not going to do that.'''
   Two congressional committees are investigating the failure of
the Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln S&amp;L, which is expected to cost the
taxpayers up to $2.5 billion _ $50 for each American family,
according to Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   The five senators intervened with federal regulators in 1987 on
behalf of Lincoln and Keating, who gave them a total of $1.3
million in campaign and other political funds. The other three are
Sens. John Glenn, D-Ohio; Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; and John
McCain, R-Ariz.
   All five senators have said they violated no law or rule of the
Senate, and they have disputed Gray's account of the 1987 meetings.
   But the Senate Ethics Committee two weeks ago appointed an
outside counsel to investigate charges that their intervention
constituted a conflict of interest.
   Asked on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' whether any of
the senators were ``more culpable than others,'' Gray said, ``Yes
absolutely... Senator DeConcini, who made the proposal, who has
continued to stonewall and deny it. And Senator Cranston,'' who
received $850,000 in corporate donations from Keating for three
voter registration projects he favored after the senators' two 1987
meetings with federal regulators.
   Meanwhile, M. Danny Wall, the nation's chief savings and loan
regulator, acknowledged on the Brinkley show that he made mistakes
in connection with the massive Lincoln S&amp;L failure, but said he has
no plan ``at this point'' to resign.
   Wall, head of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said he believed
that as congressional investigations proceed, ``time will indeed be
kind to us.'' President Bush said two weeks ago he had not ruled
out replacing Wall.
   McCain and Glenn insisted on the Brinkley show that they did
nothing wrong in connection with the Lincoln case.
   ``Any implication that I have done something wrong in this case
is just flat wrong, and I resent it with every fiber in my being,''
Glenn said.
   McCain said, ``It was a serious mistake on my part'' to have not
immediately made reimbursements for trips taken on Keating's
corporate plane, but he insisted that inquiries eventually will
clear him of any rule-breaking.
   ``I did nothing that I wouldn't do for any major employer, or
economic factor, in my state,'' McCain said.
   According to regulators, Lincoln's money _ in the form of S&amp;L
deposits insured by the federal government _ was lost to an
elaborate ``pyramid scheme'' of phony real estate and other deals
by Keating.

<HEAD>Santa Doesn't Exist, Says Book Given to Kiddies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington area's largest shopping
mall says it goofed in allowing Santa Claus to give kids a book
that offers a rude awakening: Santa doesn't exist.
   ``It's just so absurd, the irony of it,'' said Linda Smyth, of
Vienna, Va., a nurse who took her 4-year-old son, Logan, to visit
St. Nick last week at Tysons Corner Center. ``Here's Santa handing
out the one thing saying he doesn't exist.''
   After at least one mother complained, officials at Tysons Corner
Center pulled the book ``A Pee Wee Christmas'' from Santa's sack
and replaced it with stickers and fingerprinting kits.
   ``What can I say?'' Tysons General Manager Jim Foster told The
Washington Post on Sunday. ``We screwed up.''
   Foster said mall officials had screened more than a dozen books
looking for an appropriate one, but somehow missed the subplot that
says Santa isn't real.
   One of a series about a group of children called the ``Pee Wee
Scouts,'' the book relates the tale of a 7-year-old named Sonny who
is ridiculed by his friends because he says he believes in Santa.
But by the story's end, the boy admits he knows the chubby man with
the white beard and red suit is a fake.
   Author Judy Delton, who said her series has sold more than 2
million copies, told the Post the book was meant for 7- and
8-year-olds and was not intended for a mall Santa Claus to give
away to younger children.
   Last year, Foster noted, dentists objected to the candy canes
Santa gave to youngsters.
   ``You try to pick something that's noncontroversial,'' Foster
said. ``Sometimes you just can't win.''

<DATELINE>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some top performers of the folk
music boom returned to the Caffe Lena to play a few tunes in memory
of the owner of the coffeehouse that helped launch their careers.
   The memorial Sunday included performances by Loudon Wainwright
III, Rosalie Sorrells, David Bromberg and Dave Van Ronk.
   The music was filmed for a documentary about the folk music
shrine and its founder, Lena Spencer, who died Oct. 23 at age 66
from injuries sustained in a fall.
   The one-hour documentary for the BBC and PBS will memorialize a
``driving force in folk music,'' said director Stephen Trombley,
who grew up in nearby Ballston Spa and now lives in London.
   The upstate New York coffeehouse helped launch Bob Dylan's
career and featured Arlo Guthrie, Don McLean and Pete Seeger.
   Among the performers Sunday was Jack Landron, the first musician
to play at Caffe Lena when it opened in 1960. Landron dedicated a
song called ``A Little Traveling Music'' to Spencer because, he
said, ``some of us think of death as a journey.''
   Such a lasting folk club ``had to happen somewhere and couldn't
have happened just anywhere,'' Trombley said. ``A lot of places
wouldn't have accepted Lena. ... Saratoga Springs is a wacky town
and one of the few places it could have happened.''
   Christine Lavin, who worked as a waitress at Caffe Lena in the
mid-1970s, said Spencer's encouragement made her stick with her
music career. Spencer occasionally thrust Lavin on stage to build
her confidence, she said.
   ``Lena thought I had talent and wanted to give me a chance,''
said Lavin, whose performance at the memorial included a
baton-twirling drill.
   ``When I twirled here Lena was a nervous wreck because she
didn't have a lot of extra microphones,'' Lavin said. ``But I
convinced her I had enough control'' not to smash the mikes.
   Blues artist Rory Block said she was thankful Spencer never let
business interfere with who she booked at the club. Spencer let
Block play in the early 1980s, when she wasn't a big enough draw to
fill the tiny coffeehouse, she said.
   ``I never had a financial arrangement with Lena,'' said Block,
who now has five albums behind her. ``At the end of the night,
whatever she paid me, she paid me. And she paid performers every
penny she could afford and probably a little more.''

   Accusing Nicaragua of sending
surface-to-air missiles to leftist rebels, the rightist government
has suspended diplomatic and commercial ties with its Central
American neighbor.
   President Alfredo Cristiani made the announcement in a televised
address Sunday, a day after military authorities said they
discovered two light planes in El Salvador that were delivering
shoulder-fired missiles to the rebels.
   Nicaragua denied involvement and suggested such an accusation
could endanger regional peace.
   The Nicaraguan president, Daniel Ortega, said it gave his people
``honor and pride'' that a government ``of assassins of priests and
religious workers'' broke relations.
   He urged other countries to break ties with El Salvador's
U.S.-backed government until it has ``punished the assassins.''
   Ortega's was an apparent reference to the Nov. 16 massacre in El
Salvador of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter
at a university. Other Jesuits at the school say witnesses saw army
troops enter the residence before the killings.
   Cristiani has ordered an investigation into allegations the
military was involved. The murders occurred in the heat of a rebel
offensive that turned the capital into a combat zone and was the
largest of the decade-old civil war.
   The government has accused church leaders of sympathizing with _
and even aiding _ the rebels. On Sunday, authorities arrested an
American church worker and accused her of storing weapons.
   One of the planes that allegedly carried weapons from Nicaragua
crashed Saturday in eastern El Salvador and troops recovered mostly
Soviet weapons, including 25 shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles.
   Three crewmen died, and the fourth committed suicide,
authorities said.
   The other plane apparently had its cargo unloaded after landing
in the southern part of the country and was torched by the crew,
who fled. Photographers for U.S. news organizations who saw it
Sunday said trenches dug near the plane were filled with burned
debris.
   The three photographers were detained briefly Sunday for
entering the area without government permission.
   Cristiani told a news conference that relations with Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government would remain suspended until Ortega
``stops intervening in El Salvador'' or loses in national elections
Feb. 25.
   In a statement issued in Managua, the Nicaraguan government
denied any connection with the two planes.
   It quoted Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto as saying: ``The
Salvadoran government should think about the seriousness of the
declarations and actions that the news media are attributing to
them, and about the serious implications in the regional peace
process.''
   Ortega, Cristiani and three other Central American presidents in
August signed agreements in Tela, Honduras, to demobilize the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels by Dec. 5 and pledged to ban all aid to
insurgents.
   Missiles and other weapons said to have been taken from the
wreckage of the plane that crashed were displayed at Cristiani's
news conference. Introduction of such missiles into the war by the
rebels would threaten a key government advantage, control of the
air.
   As Cristiani spoke, sounds of renewed fighting _ automatic
weapons and exploding rockets _ could be heard after a pause of
several days.
   Later, the military said in a statement that an army patrol had
sighted a group of guerrillas near a power transformer on the
northwest edge of the capital and helicopters and C-47 warplanes
chased them as they fled up the slopes of San Salvador Volcano.
   The aircraft rocketed and strafed the area for several hours.
   The arrested American was identified as Jennifer Jean Casolo, of
Thomaston, Conn. She is a representative of Christian Educational
Seminar, a San Antonio-based ecumenical group.
   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, an armed forces spokesman, said
40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16 rifles, 40,000
rounds of of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47 rifles, 203
blocks of TNT and 403 detonator-caps were found at Ms. Casolo's
house during a 2 a.m. raid and at other locations he did not
specify.
   Chavez said the arms cache ``proves church involvement'' with
the rebels. He did not elaborate.
   John Blatz, a spokesman for the Christian Educational Seminar,
said by telephone that Ms. Casolo has been in El Salvador since
1985. He called the accusations ``ridiculous'' and ``part of their
(the government's) persecution of the churches. That's clear.''
   More than a dozen churches and refugee centers have been raided
by security forces since the rebels launched their offensive Nov.
11.

   Delonte Washington plopped on his
headphones, deftly fingered the computer keyboard and gleefully
watched as the screen exploded into brightly colored pictures and
the machine ``talked'' about the day's reading lesson.
   For third-grader Washington and many other students, the time
spent in the computer laboratory is a favorite part of the school
day. Yet regulations for the federal Chapter One program bar some
of his schoolmates from using the same lab because their families
aren't poor enough or there's not enough federal money to serve all
the eligible children.
   Barring such use of computer equipment is ``a waste of material
and community resources and it doesn't help education in general,''
said Warren Simmons, director of instructional support programs for
Prince George's County, Md.
   ``The money could be stretched farther if you had the
opportunity to say, `well, if these computers are not being used
for a certain part of the day, then other at-risk kids can use
them,''' he said.
   The frustration felt by Simmons and other educators made the
Chapter One program a prime topic of discussion at this fall's
national education summit.
   ``Several states report that large numbers of computers
purchased by federal funds are idle at nigh, while adult education
classes that need them either do without or use scarce tax dollars
to buy other equipment,'' said a statement signed by President Bush
and representatives of the governors who attended the two-day event.
   The federal government spends about $4 billion a year on Chapter
One, a program that provides remedial classes, teachers and
equipment to help bring educationally disadvantaged children up to
par.
   ``Clearly by every account Chapter One is one of the most
effective federal programs,'' said Michael Edwards, manager of
congressional relations for the National Education Association.
   But according to the NEA, the number of students served in
Chapter One fell from 7 million in 1980-81 to 5.7 million in
1988-89, while the number of children needing the extra help
increased to 8.5 million.
   In Prince George's County, Chapter One provides an $8 million
budget for about 8,100 eligible low-income students. The county has
104,000 students.
   Washington and about 246 other students at Langley
Park-McCormick Elementary School are Chapter One students. They
scored poorly on academic tests and were identified as needing
educational services to raise their achievement level.
   ``I'm glad to get the special attention,'' he says.
   ``The computer lab is one of the favorites,'' said Jeri Taylor,
who oversees the school's program. ``The students always want to
know, `Is today the day we go to the lab?'''
   Like most Chapter One schools, Langley Park-McCormick strictly
follows the rules to identify students and to allow only designated
children to use its equipment and remedial education material.
   That means that computers, other educational materials and even
teachers and assistants can be used only by designated students,
and sometimes are idle.
   Langley Park-McCormick has been able to leap over some of the
regulation hurdles.
   ``In a school as large as Langley Park-McCormick'' with a total
student body of 681, ``we have such a large population of Chapter
One kids, that we are not as affected as other schools,'' said Ms.
Taylor.
   Langley Park is one of only two elementary schools in the county
to be equipped with a state-of-the-art IBM computer laboratory _ 20
terminals _ for Chapter One children.
   Last year, Langley Park-McCormick won special permission to use
the computer lab, which was made for the county and is connected
into one main computer, for an evening class of English as a second
language. Six hundred adults enrolled.

   Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, who turns 50 this year, saved
more than just Christmas when he pulled Santa's sleigh by the light
of his famous snout. He saved his creator, Robert May, from
financial ruin, May's daughter recalls.
   ``My father said that Rudolph was the only reindeer in history
that kept the wolf from the door,'' said Virginia Herz, of Novato,
Calif. ``It was definitely the highlight of his life.''
   May was an advertising copywriter for Montgomery Ward in Chicago
when he invented the little reindeer _ originally called Rollo _ as
a promotional gimmick in 1939.
   The store handed out millions of copies of the story annually
until the paper shortages of World War II. It reintroduced Rudolph
in 1946, but gave up the copyright to May the following January,
his daughter said.
   It proved a turning point for the May family fortunes.
   May had the story commercially published with some success in
1947, and it was released in 1948 as a 9-minute theatrical cartoon.
   But it was in 1949 that Rudolph really took flight, when
songwriter Johnny Marks, married to May's sister, put Rudolph's
story to music and it was recorded by Gene Autry.
   ``From what I hear, it was Gene Autry's wife who really liked
the song a lot and encouraged him to sing it,'' Herz said.
   The song sold millions of copies during the 1949 Christmas
season, she said. In 1974, it became the basis for an animated
television special.
   Rudolph's popularity translated to concrete gains for the Mays,
Herz said.
   The family was able to move from a small apartment to a
four-bedroom house _ ``the house that Rudolph built,'' May would
joke _ and the copyright residuals paid for college for May's six
children.
   The copyright now is held by a company formed by May's children
and managed by Herz.
   Before his death in 1976, May donated his original manuscript
and the original pencil illustrations to Dartmouth College, which
he attended. His children donated their collection of Rudolph
memorabilia to the school's Baker Library, where it is displayed
annually.
   The display features a larger-than-life-size Rudolph statue that
once graced the May lawn in suburban Chicago.
   ``People would drive by and show their kids, `There's Rudolph,'
'' Herz said.
   For Herz, sharing childhood with the world's most famous
reindeer provided an interesting juxtaposition of real life and
fantasy.
   ``Right after the song came out and Rudolph was still in his
heyday, I was still believing in Santa Claus,'' she said. ``Rudolph
definitely existed for me. I just thought my father wrote a story
about him. It was kind of a unique experience.''
   The Rudolph bonanza gave May a feeling of accomplishment he
hadn't experienced before, she said.
   ``Being in the Montgomery Ward ad department all those years
wasn't really that exciting,'' she said. ``It was a real gift in
the whole way that Wards had given it back to him, so it brought
him a lot of joy.''
   May ``was kind of an underdog,'' Herz said, hence his story of
the reindeer that gets called names and refused entry into reindeer
games.
   ``In a way, Rudolph is almost his story,'' she said.

<HEAD>Specter Won't Stand Up Ostracized Comic For Lunch: ``He's A Friend

   Comedian Jackie Mason is not the shy type, and
he is not letting a bad experience with the New York City mayor's
race sour him on politicians.
   Mason, who starred on ABC-TV's recently-canceled ``Chicken
Soup,'' is hosting a lunch at Manhattan's trendy Elaine's
Restaurant on Dec. 8 in honor of Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   Specter insisted that the lunch was ``definitely not
fund-raising and it's definitely not political.''
   The senator was asked whether he had considered avoiding Mason,
since Mason was cut loose from the mayoral campaign of Republican
Rudolph Giuliani in September because of remarks about blacks and
Jews.
   ``Jackie Mason and I have a deal,'' Specter replied. ``I'm not
going to do any stand-up comedy, and he's not going to advise me on
arms control reduction or budget matters.''
   ``He's a friend of mine,'' Specter said. ``Everybody gets a rap
for one thing or another.''
   Mason resigned under pressure as Giuliani's honorary campaign
chairman after suggesting in an interview with the Village Voice
that Jews were supporting black Democratic candidate David Dinkins
because of Jewish ``complexes.''
   Mason also called Dinkins ``a fancy shvartze with a mustache,''
according to Newsweek. Shvartze is a Yiddish word for a black
person.
   Mason later apologized, saying, ``I'm a comedian, not a
politician.''
   Despite the flap, Mason does not plan to curb his interest in
politics, said publicist Bobby Zarem.
   ``Probably from a political point of view, there is a question
in peoples' minds about what Jackie should or should not be doing
in politics,'' Zarem said. ``But Jackie's a smart man. He's
interested in what happens to our country and what happens to our
city.''
   Mason met Specter at President Bush's inauguration last January,
according to Zarem.
   In July, Mason stopped by Specter's office for a seminar on the
Old Testament and the Torah. Specter has been holding the readings
on Wednesday afternoons for four years, under the leadership of
Biblical scholar Naomi Rosenblatt. Sens. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn.,
and Larry Pressler, R-S.D., are frequent participants.
   The lunch at Elaine's is designed so Specter ``can meet people
in New York in the publishing, literary and theater worlds,'' Zarem
said. ``It's totally for fun, a completely non-political thing,''
he said.
   The lunch is partly designed by Zarem to return a favor, Zarem
said.
   Specter said he helped Zarem, a long-time baseball fan, meet
Philadelphia Phillies outfielder Len Dykstra over the summer. Zarem
said he wanted to reciprocate.
   The invitation reads: ``The pleasure of (your) company is
requested by Jackie Mason at a luncheon in honor of Arlen Specter.''
   Specter said the lunch was timed to coincide with his
participation in the Pennsylvania Society, an organization that
brings together Pennsylvania politicians for a weekend in New York
City each year.
   ``A guy's got to have fun once in a while,'' Specter said.

   An argument in a prison cafeteria led to a
riot that spread through two cellbocks and left eight guards
hospitalized, authorities said.
   Sunday evening's disturbance at the maximum security Powhatan
Correctional Center, about 25 miles west of Richmond, was declared
under control within three hours.
   The injured included one officer who was stabbed in the back and
one with a broken nose, said Wickliffe S. Lyne, administrator of
Johnston-Willis Hospital, where several injured guards were taken.
   An assistant warden who tried to talk to inmates during the
fight was beaten up but did not require treatment, said prison
spokesman Wayne J. Farrar.
   Three prisoners who allegedly took part in the riot were placed
in solitary confinement.
   No inmates were injured, officials said.
   Officials said about 100 prisoners were in the cafeteria where
the disturbance started and spread to two nearby cellblocks that
house from 200 to 300 inmates. There are about 600 inmates at the
prison.

<TEXT>
   Hours after Communist authorities
released him from jail, Jiri Ruml found himself on a frigid,
wind-swept podium, speaking to 300,000 Czechoslovaks who share his
desire for democratic reform.
   ``I had dinner in Ruzyne last night,'' the underground publisher
told the rally, referring to the Prague jail where he was
imprisoned until his Saturday night.
   ``It wasn't the hotel,'' he added, noting a nearby hotel of the
same name.
   A chant rose from thousands at the joyous rally: ``What did you
have?''
   Ruml smiled. ``Mine was good. Since I'm on a diet, it was cherry
cake and coffee,'' he said as laughter swelled from the throng.
   ``Let them (Communist leaders) eat that cake,'' the crowd
chanted.
   ``Cherry cake at the castle, put Stepan on a diet,'' the
demonstrators roared in an acerbic reference to the overweight
Miroslav Stepan, a Communist hard-liner who resigned as Prague's
party boss Saturday and was dumped from the ruling Politburo today.
   Ruml joined other singers and speakers from the Czechoslovak
underground _ many banned from performances for two decades _ who
found their public voices again Sunday at the festive rally.
   They were recognized by the masses, who remembered their works
and recited their lyrics despite all official efforts at enforced
forgetting.
   Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the failed Prague Spring refoms
of 1968, received jubilant applause throughout his speech although
many listeners admitted being baffled by his thick Slovak accent
and his use of language heavily laden with Communist jargon.
   The crowd roared in approval as he called on the Soviet Union,
East Germany and Bulgaria to join Poland and Hungary in apologizing
for participating in the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed his
reforms movement.
   ``Our people want the truth without delay, and that should be
one of the first steps of the (new) Central Committee,'' he added
to thunderous applause.
   Playwright Vaclav Havel, whose works are banned from his country
and who has spent more than three years in prison since 1979 for
his opposition to Communist rule, also was cheered.
   A moment of silence settled over the elated throng when the Rev.
Vaclav Maly asked for a moment of silence for Pavel Wonka, a
dissident who died in jail in 1988.
   As Premier Ladislav Adamec appeared before the crowd, they
chanted ``Adamec! Adamec!''
   Adamec, introduced as a ``guest,'' was invited to address the
the huge rally after an unprecedented dialogue with opposition
leaders earlier in the day.
   His presence at the rally was a dramatic departure for the
normally reclusive leadership, accustomed over decades to simply
issuing orders by decree and to addressing crowds carefully
choreographed to deliver shows of support.
   ``As I said on television last night, I will gladly explain my
opinions and listen to anyone who wants to find a common
language,'' Adamec said.
   ``Thank you, Thank you,'' the crowd roared in response.
   But the crowd's goodwill quickly turned sour when Adamec urged
the people to shorten a general strike set for today from two hours
to two minutes.
   The plea, viewed as an attempt to render the strike meaningless,
drew loud boos and whistles from the crowd.

<HEAD>Kansas Drug Tax More Prosecutor's Tool Than Revenue Raiser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HANNA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug dealers owe the state $33.3 million in
unpaid taxes and penalties on their pot, cocaine and other illegal
uppers and downers, and the Revenue Department has collected only
$23,392.96.
   But officials say the tax on illegal drug sales does more than
bring in revenue. It gives prosecutors an easy-to-prove charge that
can mean a longer prison sentence or a better bargaining position
when defendants want to plea bargain.
   Revenue chief Ed Rolfs, whose office made the estimate of how
much is owed, said his agency became more active in trying to
collect taxes on illegal drugs earlier this year, after the 1987
law survived a legal challenge. He said it may collect $500,000
next year.
   ``The prosecutors are using it,'' said David Johnson, director
of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. ``Prosecutors, I think, take
it very seriously, and I know law enforcement takes it very
seriously.''
   At least 18 other states have taxes of some kind on illegal
drugs, according to the Council of State Governments in Lexington,
Ky.
   And as of October, West Virginia, Connecticut, Massachussetts
and Michigan were considering similar measures, according to the
council.
   Under the Kansas law, dealers are taxed $100 on each ounce of
marijuana, $200 on each gram of cocaine or controlled substance
sold by weight and $2,000 for 50 doses of drugs sold by dose,
usually prescription drugs obtained illegally.
   The law provides that a dealer who pays the tax will get a tax
stamp to put on his bags, bottles and vials. The stamps are plain
2-inch-square stickers, green for marijuana, blue for controlled
substances sold by weight and red for controlled substances sold by
dose.
   So far, only eight people have bought a total of 377 stamps
worth a total of $4,155.50, and most of the buyers are probably
stamp collectors, officials said.
   The state assesses people for taxes when it is notified of drug
busts. It has made 291 such assessments since the law went into
effect, and collected $19,237.46 in back taxes and penalties.
   The 1987 law prohibits the disclosure of the names of people who
buy the stamps _ a provision designed to protect a person's right
against self-incrimination. Dealers are liable for the tax and an
equal amount in penalties, and can be sentenced up to five years in
prison and fined another $10,000.
   ``The idea is to try to make it more costly to be in that
business,'' said Rolfs, who co-sponsored the Kansas legislation.
   Rolfs said the amount collected is small because local and
federal law enforcement agencies already have the right to seize
property used in dealing drugs. Nola Foulston, a prosecutor in
Wichita, said some people caught dealing drugs don't have much to
seize.
   ``It's like squeezing blood out of a turnip sometimes,'' she
said.
   Supporters of the law like to say that gangster Al Capone went
to prison for tax evasion, not racketeering or murder. But some
prosecutors only infrequently use the drug tax law in their cases.
   Ms. Foulston said her office had filed tax charges in about 20
of the 600 drug cases it has handled this year. Her office has
three lawyers working on drug cases, she said, and they don't have
time to document and file tax charges each time someone is arrested.
   District Attorney Nick Tomasic, in Kansas City, said he doesn't
use the law because most of the people he prosecutes in drug cases
are small-time criminals.
   ``It's not like they've got a big house we can seize, or a big
car we can seize,'' he said. ``They end up with a court-appointed
attorney.''
   Last year, defendants in Topeka and neighboring Osage County
challenged the law, saying that paying taxes for drugs would be
tantamount to violating their right against self-incrimination,
guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Two state district court judges
agreed.
   The state Supreme Court upheld the law as constitutional in
March. The justices unanimously ruled that the law contained
sufficient protections and labeled the defendants' fears ``merely
trifling or imaginary hazards.''
   According to the Council of State Governments, the other states
with such taxes are Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho,
Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
North Carolina, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.

<HEAD>GOP Tide Still Rolling in Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOUNT DORA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Jeffrey S. Book, long-time
Democratic Party activist and Michael Dukakis delegate at the 1988
national convention, has joined the Republican tide rolling across
the state.
   ``I have to focus on what's real,'' Book said. ``I've gotten
older and more conservative. I was a Democrat because I perceived
that party to be the most effective party for what I wanted to
accomplish.
   ``I am now a Republican for the same reason,'' said Book, a
Harvard-educated politician who last month at age 30 was re-elected
to his second two-year term without opposition.
   His central Florida city has only about 7,000 residents,. But
Book's switch last month was big news among politicians statewide
because of his activity on a number of local, state and national
Democratic groups.
   Such switches provide a big boost to the GOP's goal of making
Florida its first majority state in the South since Reconstruction,
said state party Chairman Van Poole.
   ``Any time we get an elected official to switch, he usually has
a following that stops and thinks,'' Poole said.
   Democrats are hoping to reverse that trend when they meet at a
party convention this weekend in Hollywood.
   The 1980s have been filled with victories for Republicans in
Florida. In 1980, there were 3,087,427 registered Democrats and
1,429,645 Republicans. As of two weeks ago, there were 3,063,673
Democrats and 2,298,005 Republicans.
   ``We're getting four out of every five new people who
register,'' said GOP state spokesman Stan Smith.
   The 1988 elections were a new high-water mark. George Bush
enjoyed his widest margin in Florida, Republican Connie Mack picked
up a U.S. Senate seat, two Republicans were elected to the state
Cabinet for the first time, and the party gained three U.S. House
seats.
   Since then, U.S. Rep. Bill Grant switched parties, giving the
GOP a majority for the first time in Florida's congressional
delegation. At least 40 state officeholders have changed parties.
   After Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper's death at age 88,
Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen won a special election in August for
the seat Pepper held for the Democrats since 1962.
   ``We continue to climb, and they're in an airplane in a tailspin
they can't pull out of,'' Poole said.
   Next year's Florida elections will have far-reaching effects.
Gov. Bob Martinez, struggling in the polls, will try to become the
first two-term Republican governor in recent Florida history, while
the party tries to cinch another post-Reconstruction first for the
South: control of the Florida state Senate. The Republicans can do
it if they win four new seats.
   The Legislature will draw new boundaries after the 1990
elections. Florida, one of the nation's fastest-growing states,
will gain at least three congressional seats and possibly four
after the 1990 census.
   Poole's opposite number, Cuban-born attorney Simon Ferro of
Coral Gables, said the Democrats can reverse the trend quickly by
defeating Martinez next year.
   ``We foresee there will be a halt and then a swing back in 1990
and 1991,'' Ferro said. ``The governorship constitutes a very
substantial advantage to a party when it comes to maintaining the
focus of the people on party politics.''
   The Democrats opposing Martinez include U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson,
state Sen. George Stuart and Alcee L. Hastings, the recently
impeached federal judge.
   Democratic leaders are trying to head off a divisive primary by
rallying early behind Nelson, a one-time Space Shuttle passenger
they see as having the diverse appeal needed in Florida.
   Nelson has concentrated early on conservative Southern Democrats
who have been voting Republican in statewide elections. The
Democrats say they can win them back; Republicans say the
Democratic registration majority exists on paper only.
   Divisiveness has hurt the Democrats, however. Ferro himself won
the party chairmanship in a tense backroom battle with former U.S.
Rep. Kenneth MacKay, who narrowly lost the 1988 Senate race to Mack.
   Book said Ferro's defeat of MacKay was the final straw in his
decision to switch parties. MacKay, a fiscal conservative with a
pristine record on ethics, was clearly the best choice to get the
party turned around, Book said.
   MacKay, now the state campaign chairman, said Democrats still
represent the true beliefs of most Floridians.
   ``A lot of it is not ideology. They've been turning away because
they think we've lost our vitality,'' MacKay said.

<HEAD>Stocks Hit New Record High in Tokyo, Dollar Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose to its
fourth consecutive record high closing today, while the dollar
declined against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 397.06 points, or 1.09
percent, closing at 36,881.53. The previous record was 36,484.47,
set Friday, when the index climbed 197.55 points.
   Dealers attributed the continued rise to stabilized external
factors such as foreign exchange rates and prospects for lower U.S.
interest rates.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve Board recently lowered the nation's
federal funds rate, a short-term lending rate between commercial
banks.
   ``Normally, trading on the last day of the month is inactive,
but today it was different,'' said Yutaka Yoshino, a trader with
Nikko Securities Co.
   He said today's trading was very active as investors expected
further rises in the index for their December transactions, which
start Tuesday.
   Investors bought a wide variety of issues including steel,
shipbuilding and trading house shares, Yoshino said.
   ``Recent democratization in Eastern Europe also encouraged
buying because many investors think such changes in the Eastern
bloc will provide them more business opportunities,'' he said.
   An estimated 1 billion shares changed hands on the first section
Monday, up from Friday's 900 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 143.35 yen, down 0.45
yen from last Friday's 143.80-yen finish. It opened at 143.18 yen
and ranged between 143.05 yen and 143.38 yen.
   Dollar-yen dealing was inactive in Tokyo, as trading was
dominated by buying of the West German mark, said Minori Takeuchi,
a Chemical Bank trader.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo following a similar downswing
overseas as market players sold dollars to buy the West German
currency.
   West Germany is expected to become a major beneficiary of the
recent moves toward democracy and economic reform in Eastern Europe.
   Shortly before the market closed, the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
reported that the United States may announce plans for a troop
reduction in Europe, but Ms. Takeuchi said it would have little
impact on the market.
   In the past, market players have bought dollars on rumors of
U.S. arms reductions.
   ``If you only look at the defense budget, the arms reduction (in
Europe) may improve the U.S. deficit,'' Ms. Takeuchi said. ``But
what are military personnel going to do after they return to
America? That may increase the unemployment rate in the United
States, and that does not necessarily improve the situation.''

<HEAD>Grain Dealer to Close Elevator After 52 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clyde Rabideau saw horse-drawn wagons
deliver grain to his downtown elevator, never required his
customers to sign contracts, and occasionally loaned them money.
   After 52 years in the grain business, Rabideau has decided to
retire and close his elevator.
   ``I'm 78. It's time to go,'' said Rabideau, who knows it won't
be easy to leave. ``It's rough.''
   He glanced anxiously at his watch, reached for his old portable
radio, and at precisely 1:50 p.m., turned it on.
   The announcer read the day's highs, lows and closing prices for
corn, soybeans and wheat. Rabideau recorded the numbers in his
ledger, as he has done for decades.
   The ritual soon will end _ perhaps as early as Dec. 1.
   When the last grain stored at the elevator has been sold,
Rabideau will put the radio back on the corner of his desk, return
the ledgers to the huge steel vault, and walk away.
   ``This elevator was built in 1918, so it was built for the horse
and buggy,'' he said.
   Rabideau Grain is a rural island in downtown Kankakee, a
northwestern Illinois city of 100,000.
   When the elevator opened, it was perfect for the single grain
wagons pulled by tractors or an occasional team of horses.
   ``It just wasn't made for these 500-bushel trucks,'' said
Rabideau. ``They can't get into the driveway very well, and the
traffic right downtown is terrible.''
   Rabideau was born on a farm near Clifton in 1911, but decided
early that life on the land was not for him.
   ``There was no money in it, and way too much work,'' he said.
   He worked four years at a hospital, and attended Gallagher
Business School for a year. It was Mary Gallagher who sent him to
see Claude Carter at the grain elevator for a job.
   Rabideau was paid $15 a week.
   ``I tell that to people now and they think it just can't be
so,'' he said. ``But ... working on the farm meant working for $10
or $15 a month.''
   Buying and selling grain was only part of the business.
   ``We did grinding of corn and oats for dairy cattle, plus mixing
hog and poultry feed,'' Rabideau recalled.
   In 1972, he bought the business from Carter.
   His customers were his friends; a handshake was his bond.
   ``We made many contracts these past 52 years,'' said Rabideau.
``We never had one of them signed by any customer.''
   Only twice in half a century did that cause a problem.
   ``Once in a while, some of our customers would need a few
hundred dollars,'' said Rabideau. ``If we were in a position to
help out, we would.''
   Through the years, retired farmers have stopped in the elevator
office to chat with Rabideau and other friends and neighbors.
   ``In the end, we were buying grain from their children and
grandchildren,'' he said.
   Most of the grain delivered to Rabideau was sold to processors
in the area.
   Rabideau will take some mementos with him _ the brass
thermometer on the wall and his old brass grain probe.
   And, he will take something even more valuable.
   ``I've had, and still have, many fond memories of working with
our farmers,'' he said. ``They're a grand bunch of honest and
hard-working people.''

<HEAD>Seven Strikers Arrested in Rock-Throwing Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Machinists were banned from picketing at the
airport after strikers pelted cars with rocks and beat up an
Eastern employee, authorities said.
   Seven strikers were arrested Sunday on charges of unlawful
assembly when they refused to leave the area at the Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport. Machinists involved in the strike
against Eastern have set up a tent city on the airport grounds.
   The Eastern worker, Stanley Almon, told police he was leaving a
maintenance hangar after the shift change when strikers began
throwing rocks at his car and smashed windows.
   Almon was attacked by about 15 men when he jumped from his car
and yelled at about 300 strikers near the hangar, said police
Officer C.W. Wood.
   Wood, assigned to guard the area, said he waded into the melee
and rescued Almon, who was treated at a hospital for a dislocated
finger.
   After the incident, police ordered all but 20 strikers out of
the tent city, said Mark Coates, airport operations spokesman. He
said the 20 were allowed to remain to guard equipment at the
encampment.
   One striker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Machinists union members were frustrated by the events of the past
week, which included a decision by Eastern's pilots and flight
attendants to end their walkout that began to show solidarity with
the Machinists.

<HEAD>$2 Million Raised For Bay Earthquake Relief Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Octogenarian Bob Hope shared the stage with
the likes of rocker Bonnie Raitt and Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash in an
earthquake relief benefit that raised more than $2 million.
   Entrepreneur Bill Graham, who co-produced the 12-hour
``rock-a-thon'' concerts Sunday with public television station
KQED, agreed to match up to $1 million in phoned-in pledges.
   That threshhold was crossed early today, several hours after the
three-concert benefit ended. Music from the concerts in San
Francisco, Oakland and Watsonville was broadcast on KQED and
Northern California radio stations.
   Hope decided at the last minute to join the event. At first, the
86-year-old comedian joked from the television studio that it was
hard for him to leave his golf game.
   Later, Hope was greeted by a wildly cheering crowd at the Cow
Palace in San Francisco.
   The concerts billed more than 45 acts, including vocalist Bobby
McFerrin and blues performer Taj Mahal, guitarists Carlos Santana
and Neil Young, the Chambers Brothers, percussionist Pete Escovedo
and the Latino-rock group Los Lobos.
   Fund-raising hosts interrupted the entertainment for brief
periods to urge viewers and listeners to contribute. The
7.1-magnitude earthquake that rocked Northern California on Oct. 17
killed 67 people and caused an estimated $7 billion in damage.
   Willie Brown, speaker of the state Assembly, vowed to donate up
to $50,000 of funds earmarked for his re-election campaign if his
fellow elected officials chipped in.
   Homeless quake victims were allowed in free to the show in
Watsonville, a small, largely Hispanic community south of Santa
Cruz that was among the hardest-hit areas.
   Performers donated their time, as did Graham's staff and many
union employees. Hotels donated more than 100 rooms for out-of-town
entertainers and performance halls were provided at cost.

   The mother and friends of an American
church activist arrested in El Salvador denied the accusations of
Salvadoran police that she had hidden explosives and ammunition for
leftist guerrillas.
   ``Jennifer is working for the church,'' said Audrey Casolo, the
mother of 28-year-old Jennifer J. Casolo. ``She is working to help
the poor people.''
   Salvadoran police on Sunday arrested Ms. Casolo and seized a
cache of ammunition they said was buried under her house in San
Salvador. Police briefly exhibited Ms. Casolo for reporters Sunday,
but she was not provided an opportunity to comment.
   Ms. Casolo, of Thomaston, is a representative of the Christian
Educational Seminar, an ecumenical group based in San Antonio,
Texas, that provides tours of El Salvador to visiting Americans.
   Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., said he was assured by the
Salvadoran ambassador in Washington, D.C., that Ms. Casolo would
not be harmed.
   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, an Salvadoran armed forces
spokesman, said 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16
rifles, 40,000 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47
rifles, 203 blocks of TNT and 403 detonator caps were found in Ms.
Casolo's house and at other locations.
   Chavez said the cache ``proves church involvement'' with the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the guerrillas of El
Salvador. Salvadoran authorities said they were tipped off to the
arms cache by a rebel deserter.
   Friends noted that Ms. Casolo's arrest came amid a wave of
harassment and arrests of church workers of various denominations
in El Salvador. Six Jesuit priest-professors were slain Nov. 16 and
witnesses said the military was involved.
   Since her 1983 graduation from Brandeis University, Ms. Casolo
has worked with the church and the poor. After receiving her degree
in American and Latin American studies, she worked at a soup
kitchen in Chicago and taught English to refugees in Maryland.
   In 1984, she taught adults to read and write in a village in the
Dominican Republic.
   Four years ago, she went to El Salvador to organize tours for
delegations from the United States and Canada, said Susan Abbott, a
friend from Thomaston High School.
   ``She would take them around,'' she said. ``They would see
government officials. They would go to refugee camps, the
cooperatives they had down there. From the left to the right, she
tried to give the delegations a real feel for what was going on in
El Salvador.''
   Another friend of Ms. Casolo from New Haven, who once worked
with her in El Salvador, said she suspects the ammunition was
planted by agents of the Salvadoran government.
   ``They're trying to frame her to justify the actions taken by
the military against international church workers in the last two
weeks,'' said the friend, Ann Lutterman. ``They're trying to imply
that churches are responsible for the violence, which is
ludicrous.''
   John Blatz, a spokesman for the Christian Educational Seminar,
called the accusations against Ms. Casolo ``part of their
persecution of the churches. That's clear.''
   At times family and friends have wanted Ms. Casolo to return to
United States, but Ms. Casolo felt she had a calling among the
people of El Salvador, Abbot said.
   ``She feels like she's really being helpful. That's where she
was happy being,'' Abbott said. ``Naturally, we're all worried
about her.''

   City governments are willing to be soldiers in
the battle against drugs but need more than just fighting words
from the Bush administration, mayors attending an annual conference
said.
   Mayor Terry Goddard of Phoenix, president of the National League
of Cities, said Sunday the federal government must do more to fight
illegal drugs, viewed by Americans as the gravest problem facing
the country.
   ``And yet, we've heard all the rhetoric, we heard (drug czar
William) Bennett make all the right analyses, and then the mountain
labored and out came a mouse. There were no new resources, no new
commitment to fight drugs,'' Goddard said at the conference
attended by 5,000 officials.
   ``The federal government needs to step in,'' said Seattle Mayor
Charles Royer. ``Give me a break about `the federal government's
money' _ just because they print it doesn't mean they earn it.''
   With such a large chunk of federal tax being funneled into
defense, it is hard to get funding for local programs, Royer said.
   Mayor Andrew Young, a former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said major cuts in military spending won't come soon,
despite the improved relations between the United States and the
Soviet Union and the growing independence of Eastern Europe.
   ``A 5 percent cut in military spending may be realistic, but I
don't see a drastic dismantling of the military empire,'' Young
said. ``We must wait and see if the changes are maintained. We were
doing pretty well in China, and all of a sudden they clamped down.''
   Young said the lack of federal resources to resolve domestic
problems is rooted in the lack of decisive national leadership.
``The problem with Washington is that nobody will make a decision
about anything,'' he said.
   Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich said that inadequate public
education is the root of the drug problem. ``Somehow, we have to
get these kids as early as we can and teach them not to use
drugs,'' he said.
   ``When I was elected in 1977, crack was not even in our
vocabulary. Now, it is the symbol of a lost generation ... of
people who are not safe on the streets,'' Royer said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle canceled a scheduled address today due
to a death in his family. Jack Kemp, secretary for Housing and
Urban Development, is scheduled to speak Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Former President Carter said the Ethiopian
government and Eritrean rebels invited former Tanzanian President
Julius K. Nyerere to help mediate talks to end 28 years of civil
war.
   The accord marks the end of preliminary negotiations between the
two sides that should lead to substantive talks to stop the war,
Carter told The Atlanta Constitution in an interview published
today.
   The decision to invite Nyerere to join him as co-chairman of the
main talks was the last of 12 items on the agenda for preliminary
talks, Carter said during a diplomatic shuttle mission through
Sudan and Ethiopia.
   Although the preliminary talks in Nairobi almost broke down
twice, ``both sides got what they wanted by Saturday,'' Carter
said. All that remains is to name observers to the main talks, he
said.
   Carter said it may be several weeks before a decision is made on
the time and place of the talks because the government and Eritrean
People's Liberation Front delegates must confer with leaders at
home.
   Delegates from both sides agreed on most negotiating issues two
months ago in Atlanta, and resumed the talks in Nairobi to conclude
the preliminary talks, Carter said.
   Carter said he expects Nyerere, who has been traveling in the
Far East, to accept the invitation. ``He has indicated in the past
that he would if the invitation came from both sides, and not just
from me,'' Carter said.
   While the negotiating teams took a break Sunday, Carter flew
through Sudan and Ethiopia.
   He met for 90 minutes in Khartoum with Sudanese President Omar
Hassan Ahmed Bashir, whose government will begin preliminary peace
talks with rebels in southern Sudan on Friday. Carter helped
arrange the talks to help end Sudan's civil war but will not be
directly involved.
   In Addis Ababa, Carter met with Ethiopian President Mengistu
Haile Mariam and three members of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, the Sudanese rebels whose headquarters is in Ethiopia's
capital.
   Carter, who initiated the Eritrean peace talks, said he was
pleased with their progress, but cautioned:
   ``There were a couple of times when the talks almost broke up
when one side or the other announced that they were leaving. There
is still a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of mistrust.''

   Relatives of those killed in the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 have asked President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev
to discuss sanctions against Syria and Iran during their summit
meeting this week.
   In a letter delivered to the U.S. and Soviet embassies in London
on Friday, three organizations representing the relatives aske the
leaders to ``spare the time to address the problem of international
state-backed terrorism'' during their weekend meeting at Malta.
   The relatives have not received a reply from the Soviets or the
White House. Relatives have said they may hold a news conference in
Malta during the meeting.
   The groups urged that economic sanctions be used to combat
state-backed terrorism. They believe Flight 103 was blown up over
Lockerbie, Scotland by a Syrian-backed terrorist group and financed
by Iran in retaliation for the downing of an Iranian airliner by a
U.S. warship.
   The letter was written by the two groups of U.S. victims'
relatives, Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and Families of Pan-Am
103-Lockerbie, and the relatives' group in the United Kingdom, U.K.
Families _ Flight 103.

   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies except the British pound in early European trading
today. Gold prices were higher.
   Currency dealers predicted the dollar could have firmer moments
on technical rebounds, but said it's on a weak trend through the
end of the year.
   ``The dollar no longer has very much support,'' said one analyst
in Milan, Italy.
   Jens-Uwe Fischer, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover in
Frankfurt, said the primary factor behind the dollar's recent
weakness was the drop in U.S. Federal Funds rates to 8.25 percent
from 8.50 percent.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.45 yen to a closing 143.35 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 143.39 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.7907 West German marks, down from 1.8040
   _1.6030 Swiss francs, down from 1.6145
   _6.1163 French francs, down from 6.1600
   _2.0215 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0340
   _1,322.50 Italian lire, down from 1,333.75
   _1.1665 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.5567 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5635 late Friday.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major reiterated on Sunday he
was prepared to raise the cost of borrowing if necessary to bring
down inflation.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.90 a troy ounce, up
from $416.25 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $417.00, up from $416.10 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.12 to close at a bid $418.02.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.85 a troy ounce, down
from Friday's $5.86.

<HEAD>Officials Impound Hundreds of Ballots in Suspected Vote Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The opposition claimed fraud in the
northern state of Tamaulipas after election officials impounded
more than 1,000 apparently pre-marked ballots.
   The ballots were in polling boxes stuffed with votes cast for
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish
initials PRI, before the polls opened Sunday.
   At Matamoros precinct No. 35A, where only 18 people had signed
in to vote by mid-morning, election officials counted 562 ballots
cast in the race for state representative, and 429 in the separate
box for the mayoral election.
   Almost all of the extra ballots were marked for candidates of
the PRI.
   ``The people of Matamoros will not accept this, and neither will
the people of Tamaulipas,'' said Jorge Cardenas, candiate for mayor
of Matamoros for the opposition Authentic Party of the Mexican
Revolution.
   Matamoros, a city of about 180,000 people, lies just across the
Texas border from Brownsville.
   Reymundo Padilla, president of precinct No. 35A, said he did not
know how the ballots ended up in the boxes before polls opened.
   ``Somebody put them in the boxes,'' Padilla said.
   ``Fraude, fraude, fraude,'' a crowd chanted at a health clinic
where the ballots were being tallied. Voting was suspended
temporarily.
   PRI mayoral candidate Javier Muzquiz said vote fraud would be
impossible in Matamoros because precinct officials would discover
it.
   PARM officials turned over 300 additional ballots marked for the
PRI after discovering a man carrying them with him.
   Valentin Jimenez Mora, a PARM candidate for state
representative, said the votes ``were to be used for tacos'' _
ballots with several additional ballots secretly folded inside,
making it possible for one person to cast more than one vote.

<HEAD>Turtle Or Egg? Appeal Should Answer Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of poaching more
than 1,000 eggs of endangered sea turtles has filed an appeal that
puts a new twist on an old question: What came first, the turtle or
the egg?
   James A. Bivens was convicted in March of poaching 1,088 eggs.
He was sentenced to 60 days in jail and fined $500, plus $100 for
each egg taken from the beach on Singer Island. The fine amounts to
$109,300.
   In court documents, Bivens' attorney argued that the fine is
illegal because state law allows a judge to levy a $100 fine ``per
unit of marine life.''
   But when does marine life begin?
   ``An egg, according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes a
life when it is hatched ... is not a turtle,'' Assistant Public
Defender Louis Carres wrote. ``Hence the universal question: Which
came first, the chicken or the egg?''
   Bivens is appealing the County Court fine to Circuit Court. Last
week, a three-judge panel set Jan. 18 for oral arguments.
   Prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new to
them, but ridiculous nevertheless.
   ``If you kill an egg, it's not going to become a turtle,
obviously,'' said Barbara Schroeder, sea turtle recovery
coordinator for the state Department of Natural Resources.

<HEAD>Poll: Women's Movement Yes, Feminism No</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most American women think the women's movement
has made their lives better, yet only one in three consider
themselves feminists, according to a poll.
   The poll of 1,000 American women, published in the Dec. 4 issue
of Time magazine, found that 94 percent believe the women's
movement has helped them become more independent, 86 percent credit
it with giving them more control over their lives, and 82 percent
think it is still improving their lives.
   Yet 76 percent said they pay ``not very much'' or ``no''
attention to the women's movement.
   Analysts attribute these contradictory attitudes to the very
success of the women's movement, Time says.
   ``Saying the women's movement is dead is like saying the cold
war is dead,'' said Carol Gilligan, a Harvard professor. ``No. No.
It's over. It's won.''
   Asked to select the most important goals for the women's
movement today, respondents rated ``helping women balance work and
family'' as the No. 1 priority.
   Second was ``getting government funding for programs such as
child care and maternity leave.''
   The poll, conducted by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman, surveyed
1,000 women by phone on Oct. 23-25, and has a margin of error of
plus or minus three percent, Time said.

<HEAD>Catholic University Suspends Pro-Choice Student Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loyola University barred a student group from
meeting on campus unless it reverses its support of women's right
to choose abortion and to use contraception.
   The Women's Center at the Roman Catholic school cannot be
recognized as an official student group if it insists on advocating
abortion rights and contraception, said university spokesman Joseph
Marren.
   ``It's a freedom of speech issue _ the anti-choice position is
clearly represented on campus,'' said David Gandolfo, a Women's
Center member.
   He said the Women's Center was founded on campus in 1978 and had
its constitution approved by the administration in 1982.
   The Catholic Church teaches that abortion is murder and forbids
the use of artificial contraceptive devices.
   On one occasion, Loyola officials stopped the group from
distributing Illinois Public Health Department packets on AIDS,
each of which included a condom.
   The dispute follows controversies at other Catholic universities
this fall over publication of an advertisement in student
newspapers urging attendance at Nov. 10 abortion-rights rallies.
   At Marquette University in Milwaukee, the business manager for
student publications was fired for running the ad, and two students
were suspended from their posts on the newspaper staff.
   Student editors at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.,
refused to publish an edition of the school newspaper when they
were barred from running the ad.
   The ad ran in the student newspaper at the Catholic University,
also in Washington, prompting protests from anti-abortion advocates
and a critical letter to the editor from a university official.

<HEAD>Storm Dumps up to 3 Feet of Snow in West, Moves Eastward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Near-blizzard conditions blew into the Dakotas today from a
storm that dumped up to 4 feet of snow from the Sierras to the
Rockies. So much snow fell in Utah that a World Cup ski race was
postponed.
   The snow delighted early-season recreational skiers but sent
cars skidding off roads and into each other, prompted some
avalanche warnings and caused power outages.
   Icy roads were blamed for car crashes that killed three people
in Montana on Sunday. Some schools were closed in Minnesota today.
   Interstate highways and smaller roads were closed at times
during the weekend, causing major traffic jams as Thanksgiving
holiday travelers tried to return home.
   I-80 over Donner Summit at Truckee, Calif., was closed for
nearly 10 hours into early Sunday, and the California Highway
Patrol reported traffic delays of three to four hours through the
pass later in the day. The National Weather Service said the storm
dumped 13 inches of snow on Donner Summit on Friday and another 38
inches Saturday and early Sunday.
   In Utah, World Cup officials determined that conditions were too
dangerous for men's slalom races Sunday at Park City, which got
nearly two feet of snow by nightfall.
   But the snow meant other ski areas were able to open.
   ``There's an awful lot of (snow) out there. It's a welcome
sight,'' said Angela Gaines, an Alta Ski Lift employee. Alta had 26
inches of snow by Sunday night.
   However, the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center issued an avalanche
warning for the mountains around Salt Lake City, Provo and Park
City.
   In addition to snow, the storm also yielded two funnel clouds
and 50-60 mph winds in southern Davis County in Utah, but
authorities reported no damage or injuries. High winds also were
blamed for power interruptions in Utah's Santa Clara County.
   In Montana on Sunday, three people died in crashes on icy roads,
while passengers in about 1,000 cars and trucks on I-90 between
Bozeman and Livingston were stuck in a traffic jam 10 miles long,
the state highway patrol said. The patrol temporarily closed the
highway's westbound lanes.
   The storm moved east today, piling up heavy snow in Colorado's
northern and central mountains and in the western Dakotas.
   ``Near blizzard conditions, that's what it's like in the western
Dakotas,'' Karl Swanberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Minneapolis, said early today.
   ``It's gusting 50 mph, producing near zero visibility'' around
Rapid City, S.D., Swanberg said.
   No snowfall estimates were available early today. ``It's hard to
measure when it's blowing around like that,'' he said.
   Temperatures were expected to drop into the low teens and as
many as 8 inches of snow were forecast for northwestern Minnesota
and eastern North Dakota.
   All Moorhead, Minn., schools canceled classes today after the
area got four inches of snow during the night. Two- to 3-foot
snowdrifts were common, said meteorologist Bob Nordlund of the
National Weather Service in Fargo, N.D.
   In the Pacific Northwest, the storm dumped snow in most of
Oregon's mountains. Two of the state's largest ski resorts _
Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood and Mount Bachelor ski area in
central Oregon _ opened Sunday.
   ``If you open before Thanksgiving, that means a great year. Now
we're going to have to settle for a good year,'' said Gary
Hohnstein, assistant general manager of Timberline Lodge, where two
of five chairlifts opened Sunday. But that was three days too late
for a resort that relies on sales up to $50,000 a day during the
holiday weekend.

<HEAD>Report: Public Growing Complacent on AIDS Prevention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public has become too complacent about
educating people to prevent the spread of AIDS, according to a
study that shows the gay community alone has taken the threat
seriously.
   The report by the Citizens Commission on AIDS released today
urges vigorous new educational programs to boost AIDS prevention,
which the group says is hampered by continuing public
misconceptions about the disease.
   ``A basic assumption for prevention methods has been to scare
people to death and they'll change their behavior,'' said Carol
Levine, the commission's director. ``AIDS prevention is much more
complicated than that.''
   The report says education has stemmed the spread of AIDS in the
gay community. But it points to the growing number of adolescents
and non-drug-using women infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS, as evidence that educational efforts do not reach all those
at risk.
   The report attacks what it labels 10 myths about AIDS, such as
``AIDS education for drug users is a waste of time and money
because they are unconcerned about their health.''
   Another myth, the report says, is that, ``If people are given
accurate information, they will change their attitudes and
behavior.''
   For example, Levine said, the dangers of smoking have been known
for decades, but smoking has only begun to decrease in recent years.
   ``We don't have that amount of time, or else we'll lose a
tremendous amount of our young people,'' she said of the AIDS
epidemic.
   The report offers facts and recommendations to counter commonly
held misconceptions, as well as examples of successful education
programs.
   The commission is a private, independent group that was formed
in July 1987.

<TEXT>
   In defining his own vision of a communism that
works, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has endorsed a ``humane'' socialism
that he insists might even have to adopt traits of modern
capitalism to stay relevant.
   ``In the hullabaloo of our constant confrontation with
capitalism, we clearly underestimate the importance of much that
has been done by humanity over the centuries,'' the Soviet
president said in remarks published Sunday.
   ``The new face of socialism is its human face, this fully
corresponds to the thought of Marx,'' Gorbachev said in the
Communist Party daily Pravda. ``Because its creation is the chief
goal of restructuring, we can with full justification say we are
building humanitarian socialism.''
   He said achievements attained under capitalism, like ``equality
of all before the law'' and general prosperity, should not be
dismissed because of ideology.
   Gorbachev also seemed to defend his reforms from charges they
lack a clear blueprint, citing the precedent of Soviet founder
Vladimir Lenin.
   ``There is a deep-seated belief that Lenin supposedly had a
completed program for the development of socialism in our country.
But in fact he had no such completed program,'' he said.
   In Czechoslovakia, the latest East bloc country in political
upheaval, Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the 1968 ``Prague
Spring'' reform movement that was crushed by Soviet tanks, read
Gorbachev's remarks as proof of the Kremlin leader's support for
change in East Europe.
   For Communists, the wording ``socialism with a human face'' is
inseparably linked with Dubcek and the Prague Spring.
   Gorbachev has declared his support before for economic and
social change in Eastern Europe, but by appropriating Dubcek's
words, he made his point dramatically.
   Some in Prague took Gorbachev's comments as a public admission
that the 1968 invasion, which led to Dubcek's overthrow, was a
mistake. The Soviet Union has not yet renounced the invasion as it
has the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.
   As recently as last year, the Kremlin was vigorously defending
the intervention in Czechoslovakia as necessary to block
``anti-socialist forces.'' Soviets also avoided any comparisons
between what Dubcek tried to do and Gorbachev's reforms. ``The
difference is 20 years,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov once said laconically.
   Pravda said the 2{-page article was a synthesis of Gorbachev's
recent thoughts on the future of socialism and his own program for
``perestroika,'' or reconstruction of the economy and society.
   The Soviet leader's major theme seemed to be that socialism must
modernize _ even adopt traits of capitalism if necessary _ or risk
becoming irrelevant. He offered no quick answers but said the
process would take years, ``into the 21st century.''
   He defended the 1917 revolution that brought the Communists to
power in the former Russian Empire as a ``world-historical
breakthrough to the future,'' but said socialism has often been
perverted since.
   ``For the sake of a wrongly understood collectivism, human
individuality was ignored, the development of the personality was
slowed,'' he said.

   Jim and Tammy Ministries held its last
church service at a shopping center and supporters said they plan
to meet in the future at an unnamed hotel.
   A ministry spokesman said Sunday that supporters wanted to keep
the location secret because they are tired of walking through
reporters and television cameras to get to church.
   Earlier this month, the ministry reached an agreement with its
landlord to move out of the Shoppers World plaza by Thursday.
Stewart Gilman, owner of the plaza, said Sunday he did not know
where the ministry would go.
   Tammy Faye Bakker, who led several services this month at the
shopping center, was visiting her husband at a Rochester, Minn.,
federal prison Sunday.
   Jim Bakker is serving a 45-year sentence after being convicted
of fraud and conspiracy charges connected with the now-defunct PTL
ministry.
   Reporters were kept out of Sunday's services but listened
through the door as about 40 people worshiped inside.

<DATELINE>EAST PITTSBURGH, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hardly anyone showed up at a
Thanksgiving party for the poor but a food bank will distribute the
hundreds of pounds of leftovers.
   Caterer John Kostik said he had hoped to serve at least 700
needy people at his banquet hall in this Pittsburgh suburb
Thursday. Twenty-four showed up, fewer than the 35 volunteers who
offered to help serve the food.
   After his plight was publicized, Kostik and his wife, Jane, both
40, gave out food to about 80 people Friday but still had about 200
pounds of turkey, 210 pounds of potatoes, 60 cases of bulk corn and
more than 200 pumpkin pies left.
   Kostik said his use of the word ``needy'' on the flyers may have
discouraged some people in the neighborhood _ home to many
unemployed former steelworkers and senior citizens _ from showing
up.
   ``We don't have a lot of street people in East Pittsburgh,'' he
said. ``This is a quiet, depressed area with a population that is
too proud to ask for help.''
   Kostik said he mailed dozens of public service announcements
about the feast, which cost him $1,000, to newspapers and
television and radio stations, but apparently none were used.
   Volunteers posted flyers throughout the neighborhood, but that
didn't help either.
   Kostick said he was disappointed at the turnout.
   ``I was left with a real empty feeling, but the media attention
helped us _ after the fact,'' he said.
   The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank will distribute the
leftovers to poor families, said Joyce Rothermel, the group's
executive director.

   High winds and heavy snow swept into the Dakotas today from a
storm that left up to 4 feet of snow in the Western mountains, and
forecasters said the front would move east toward the Great Lakes
by tonight.
   ``Near blizzard conditions, that's what it's like in the western
Dakotas,'' Karl Swanberg, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Minneapolis, said early today. ``It's gusting 50 mph,
producing near zero visibility'' around Rapid City, S.D.
   Winter storm warnings were posted for today for parts of
Colorado, North and South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Gale
warnings were posted for Lake Ontario.
   Advisories for snow with gusty winds were posted for tonight for
parts of Montana, Wyoming, Iowa, the Dakotas, Minnesota and
Wisconsin.
   Winter storm watches were posted for today and tonight for upper
Michigan.
   The storm brings high winds with it. Winds gusted to more than
60 mph in Utah on Sunday and to 55 mph in Las Vegas.
   Snow fell into Sunday evening in northern Maine and northern
Vermont and along the eastern end of Lake Ontario. Snow also fell
in north central California and east central Nevada and from
eastern Washington across the Idaho Panhandle and the western
two-thirds of Montana, western Wyoming and northern Utah.
   Rainshowers reached from southwestern South Dakota across the
Nebraska Panhandle, southeast Wyoming and northern Colorado, over
southeast Louisiana and the southern half of the Florida Peninsula.
   Thunderstorms over western Oregon left small hail at Troutdale
during the late afternoon.
   The National Weather Service said Donner Summit at Truckee,
Calif., got 13 inches of snow Friday and another 38 inches Saturday
and early Sunday. In Utah, Alta had 25 inches of snow by
mid-afternoon Sunday.
   High temperature for the nation Sunday was 88 degrees at

   Swiss voters rejected an attempt to abolish the
country's army by the year 2000, but the measure won much more
support than expected in what one pacifist called ``a slap in the
face of the establishment.''
   The government tried to put on a brave face after 1,052,218
voters, or 35.6 percent of those who cast ballots, voted in favor
of the proposed constitutional amendment that stated simply
``Switzerland has no army.'' Opposed were 64.4 percent, 1,903,797.
   Voter turnout Sunday was 69 percent, the highest for a
referendum since the 1971 measure that gave women the right to
vote. The anti-army vote was well above the 30 percent predicted by
polls.
   The government had urged voters to reject the proposal, saying a
credible defense policy is vital to guarantee the country's
independence and neutrality.
   Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger said he would set up a panel to
analyze criticisms voiced about the 625,000-strong army and
attributed the strong anti-army vote to ``the relaxation of tension
which happily dominates the international scene.''
   Supporters were stunned.
   ``The result is unbelievable,'' said Andreas Gross, spokesman
for the coalition of pacifists and left-wing groups that collected
the 100,000 signatures necessary to force the referendum. ``It is a
slap in the face for the establishment.''
   ``If 500,000 people can bring changes in Prague, then the high
proportion of `yes' votes should give the Swiss government food for
thought,'' he said, referring to the pro-democracy movement in
Czechoslovakia.
   The Social Democratic Party, describing the vote as
``sensational,'' called for an examination of defense policies. As
a priority, the law should be changed to allow conscientious
objectors to perform civilian duties, a statement from the party
said.
   Eugen Luethy, Chief of General Staff, admitted the size of the
anti-army vote had ``exceeded his expectations'' but declared the
result ``provided a continuing solid basis for the armed forces.''
   The vote followed weeks of impassioned debate, rare in normally
reserved Switzerland.
   Many Swiss were shocked that the country's centuries-old
military tradition should be called into question by the proposal.
   Even though Switzerland has not fought in a foreign war since
1515, it can field more men per square mile than any other country
in the world but Israel.
   Switzerland has more artillery pieces than neighboring West
Germany and a fleet of battle tanks half that of France.
   The Defense Ministry says military defense costs $3.1 billion
annually. Army opponents say costs are nearer $6.3 billion, taking
into account salaries in defense-related areas and the cost to
private-sector employers of releasing staff for the annual call-up.
   Currently, every Swiss man is required to do military service,
starting with 17 weeks of basic training at age 20, followed by 13
call-ups of two to three weeks until age 50.
   In a bid to relieve pressure on the country's tight labor
market, the Defense Ministry this year announced reforms to end
military service at the age of 42 by 1995.
   Supporters of the army maintain that Switzerland's defense
tactics spared the country the horrors of involvement in World War
II.
   Others argue that Switzerland stayed neutral because it curried
Hitler's favor by supplying foreign exchange and arms to the
Germans.

tower at Bogota's El Dorado International Airport as saying the
Avianca jet crashed just after taking off for the western city of
Cali.
   The crash occurred about 7:30 a.m.

   The much-maligned donkey is making a
comeback in Texas and other states, where ranchers know that
coyotes keep their distance when the stubborn beasts are making
asses of themselves.
   It's the ``deliberate'' disposition of the donkey, and the
animal's innate dislike of canines, that makes it useful guarding
goats and sheep against coyotes and other predators, said rancher
Nanci Falley.
   State officials say the donkey guard, an old-time form of
protection, is enjoying a resurgence on ranches around the country.
   ``It's such a natural thing for a donkey,'' said Ms. Falley, who
also sells the guard animals. ``It's not something that requires
training. They have a natural instinct to run dogs and coyotes out
of their territory.''
   A well-placed kick from an angry donkey _ also known as the
burro, or ass _ is usually enough to drive away any predator,
experts say.
   Ranchers have known this for years. But a new environmental
consciousness has helped promote the use of predator controls like
guard animals instead of poisons that can enter the food chain. The
low price of the donkeys doesn't hurt, either.
   Prices range from $75 to $135 for females and $20 to $60 for
males. About 1,800 of the animals currently stand sentry on Texas
ranches.
   Groups such as the Montana-based American Council of Spotted
Asses have been promoting the use of the animals in other states as
well.
   The Texas Department of Agriculture includes donkeys, as well as
guard mules and llamas, in a comprehensive predator control program
it launched in 1988. The program also employs traps, lights, sirens
and propane cannons to frighten away coyotes and wild dogs.
   Texas leads the nation in raising sheep, with 1.9 million, and
angora goats, with 1.5 million. The Texas wool and mohair
industries were worth a combined $66 million last year, officials
said, but ranchers lost about $9 million worth of livestock to
predators. Coyotes are blamed for more than half the damage.
   That's where the donkeys come in.
   Ranchers put a donkey out to forage with a herd. Soon the donkey
``adopts'' the flock as its own and begins defending it against
coyotes and other canines.
   The best way to choose a guard donkey is to let the animal get
acquainted with its herd, then introduce a dog into its pen to see
if it repels the canine.
   ``If the mule or donkey shows aggressive behavior toward the
dog, then you've got a good guard donkey,'' said Andy Feild,
predator management specialist for the Texas Agriculture Department.
   Some ranchers report more success with jennies, or female
donkeys, and geldings, neutered males. Some jacks, or intact males,
are overly aggressive with their herds.
   But Ms. Falley has raised donkeys for 23 years and said she
doesn't believe good guarding is a sexually determined trait.
   ``I would say about 85 percent make real good guards,'' she said
as she stood in a corral with donkeys Mary Ann, Rachel, Hickory
Jackson and Dandy.
   Though the donkey of fable is obstinate and stupid, Ms. Falley,
an inspector for the American Donkey and Mule Society,
characterizes the animals as wise and regal.
   ``They don't hurry. They do things in their own time,'' she
said, petting a month-old burro she calls ``Little Toot.''
   Ms. Falley said she began relying on donkeys to protect her
goats and chickens after she moved to her ranch in Lockhart,
northeast of San Antonio, in the 1960s and found that predators
considered her livestock ``groceries.''

   The Shiite Moslem extremist group Hezbollah
has established a network of operatives in West Africa that may be
preparing attacks against Western targets, a newspaper reported
today.
   Hezbollah agents are active in the Ivory Coast, Senegal, Gabon,
Zaire and possibly other countries, the Los Angeles Times reported,
citing unidentified U.S. and French officials.
   As Western intelligence agencies have focused on Iran and
Lebanon, Hezbollah may have moved to create an alternative arms
network in West Africa as early as 1986, the newspaper said.
   French authorities believe a Hezbollah cell played ``a prominent
role'' in planting a bomb aboard a French airliner that exploded
over Niger in September, killing 171 people.
   ``Tehran's reach now extends into Hezbollah communities in West
Africa, and it seeks to duplicate there what it did in Lebanon,'' a
U.S. official said.
   The pro-Iran Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for taking Western hostages and terrorist bombings
in Lebanon.
   On Saturday, Spanish police said a Hezbollah cell had tried to
smuggle 18 pounds of plastic explosives into Spain, according to
the newspaper. It said 10 people were arrested in a plot to attack
targets in Europe.
   In recent months, French officials have discovered security
breaches at their embassies in Guinea, Gabon, Senegal and Tunisia
involving the sale of passports and intelligence cables to
Hezbollah agents, the newspaper said.
   In the most serious incident, a French consular official in
Conakry, Guinea, provided 100 identity cards and 60 passports to a
Shiite cell, the Times said. The scheme surfaced when a Lebanese
national carrying one of the passports blew himself up with a
homemade bomb in London last summer, French diplomats told the
newspaper.
   In Dakar, Senegal, officials reportedly caught a French embassy
employee selling French identity cards to another group of
Lebanese. And in Brazzaville, Gabon, where the doomed UTA French
airline flight originated, a security breach involved stolen
diplomatic cables, the newspaper said.
   Most of the French consular officials involved were contract
workers who had served in Beirut or had Lebanese connections,
French officials said. Several were arrested.
   ``We don't believe the cells are being created to destabilize
the countries they are in,'' said a French official. ``But all
these countries offer bases for operations against the West.
   ``They are in the courtyard of Europe. And security is
notoriously lax in West Africa,'' the official said.
   Intelligence officials suspect the agents operate among tens of
thousands of Shiite Muslim emigres who work in the region. A State
Department source told the Times there was no evidence that Iran
has sponsored the implantation of the cells.

   Christian army commander Michel Aoun
today rejected a 48-hour ultimatum by the new president and said he
would ``die fighting for Lebanon's honor.''
   Military sources denied reports that Gen. Aoun's force and
President Elias Hrawi's backers were massing troops.
   ``There is absolutely no move on the ground to suggest that a
collision is imminent. The fronts are as they have been since the
(Sept. 22) cease-fire,'' one ranking officer said on condition of
anonymity.
   Aoun, in an interview on French television, said, ``I shall
defend myself and the free (Christian) areas to the last man. I
shall be in the forward lines of my troops and shall die fighting
for Lebanon's honor.''
   ``I do not recognize Mr. Hrawi. His election under Syrian
occupation is unconstitutional,'' Aoun said. The interview are also
broadcast by Christian radio stations.
   Hrawi, elected by Parliament Friday to replace assassinated
leader Rene Mouawad, told reporters Sunday he would not permit the
existence of two rival governments in Lebanon and said he would
replace Aoun as army commander within 48 hours.
   ``If he stays ... I must say with much regret that he will have
to bear the consequences,'' Hrawi said at his temporary
headquarters in east Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley town
of Chtoura.
   Hrawi, 64, sacked Aoun as head of an interim military Cabinet on
Saturday. But the measure was a mere formality because Aoun still
controls the military and has ignored the order.
   ``He still is general of the army, perhaps for no more than 48
hours, after which, if he stays, he will become an officer of this
army,'' Hrawi said.
   Hrawi pledged to rule from the traditional seat of Lebanon's
Maronite heads of state in suburban Baabda east of Beirut, where
Aoun has set up his command in the bunker of the shell-battered
presidential palace. Hrawi and Aoun are both Maronites.
   ``Whatever is left of Baabda, even if it is one room, when his
situation is over, it will be my residence,'' Hrawi said.
   That touched off reports that an attack was imminent and that
the Syrian army was moving in reinforcements to evict Aoun from the
hilltop Baabda palace, five miles east of Beirut.
   Christian and Moslem military sources reported no troop movement.
   A cease-fire called by the Arab League Sept. 22 halted six
months of savage artillery battles across Beirut between Aoun's
20,000 troops and the Syrian army, killing at least 930 people by
police count.
   Hrawi's aides say he is counting on the appointment of a new
army commander to shake the troops' loyalty to Aoun.
   Aoun has rejected an Arab League-brokered peace plan approved by
Lebanon's parliament in Taif, Saudi Arabia last month because it
fails to provide for a total Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops controlling 70 percent of Lebanon
under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun contends the
Syrians have become an occupying force because they sided with the
Moslems in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The Taif accord, which Hrawi has pledged to carry out, provides
for a phased Syrian pullout from major cities to redeploy in the
Bekaa within two years and gives Moslems an equal share of power
with the long-dominant Christian minority.

<TEXT>
   Uruguayans chose Luis Lacalle as
president in hopes his opposition National Party would reverse
three decades of economic decline in this once-rich South American
nation.
   In Montevideo, a Marxist doctor easily defeated all rivals to
become mayor of the country's capital and largest city.
   Eight hours after polls closed Sunday, the Interior Ministry had
issued tallies from more than half of the 8,493 voting districts
that gave Sen. Lacalle a comfortable lead.
   Lacalle, who will take office March 1, has pledged to work with
people of all political stripes in reforming Uruguay's
state-dominated economy and easing its foreign debt burden. He
pledged to build a governing coalition.
   On the basis of party and independent tallies, Jorge Batlle of
the governing Colorado Party _ the son and grand-nephew of
presidents _ acknowledged his bid had failed.
   ``The future president will be Sen. Lacalle, to whom I offer my
most sincere congratulations and best wishes for success in his
term,'' said Batlle, a 62-year-old senator who ran unsuccessfully
for president in 1966 and 1971.
   According to the Interior Ministry, the National Party received
430,846 votes, or 39.8 percent, compared with 325,879 or 30.7
percent, for the Colorados. The leftist Broad Front coalition
finished third with 168,830 votes.
   The rest of the vote was split among six smaller parties. About
2.32 million voters _ or 80 percent of those registered _ took part
in the mandatory balloting, election officials said.
   Lacalle, 48, in brief comments to reporters at his party's
headquarters, said his would be a government of ``national unity.''
After accepting the congratulations of Broad Front's presidential
candidate, retired Gen. Liber Seregni, Lacalle said he would issue
a public statement later today.
   Lacalle's party, which last held executive power in 1967, was
expected to receive the biggest bloc but not a majority in the
30-seat Senate and 99-member House of Deputies.
   In Montevideo, thousands of residents danced to bongo drums, set
off firecrackers, waved banners and cruised in cars after Broad
Front candidate Tabare Vazquez defeated all rivals to become mayor.
   ``Celebrate, neighbors, because the needy will be the most
privileged,'' an exultant Vazquez told several thousand cheering
supporters outside his party's headquarters.
   ``The mayoralty is the first step,'' said supporter Osvaldo
Martins, 37, a clothing wholesaler. ``The next step is national
power. ... If we govern well here, the rest of the country will
support us.''
   In campaigning to replace President Julio M. Sanguinetti, who
was elected in November 1984 and took office in March 1985 to
replace a military dictatorship, Lacalle focused on Uruguay's
economy.
   Under Sanguinetti, unemployment dropped from 14 percent to about
9 percent, and the deficit was halved to about 4.5 percent of gross
national product.
   But inflation refused to go below 57 percent, payments on the
$6.3 billion foreign debt cut sharply into public programs and
standards of living continued to decline.
   ``I think we're the same as we were four years ago, and some
people are worse off than before,'' said Jorge de Melo, a
26-year-old metalworker.
   ``When we look at the outside world, there have been tremendous
advances,'' said Marcos Larghero, 47, a graphic designer. ``The
opposite has occurred here. We deteriorate a little bit each year.''
   Lacalle made no promises that Uruguay would soon take its place
among the world's wealthier nations, as it was for the first half
of this century.
   But he said inflation would decrease to 20 percent, exports
would increase by 20 percent to $2 billion a year and unemployment
would continue to decline throughout his five-year term.
   To resolve the foreign debt, Lacalle proposed to sell some of
Uruguay's 3 million ounces of gold reserves, and buy investments
that would generate interest to help pay the debt.
   Lacalle has pledged to sell inefficient public companies, cut
federal bureaucracy and encourage foreign investment.

<BYLINE>No U.S. Withdrawals From Europe Before Arms Deal, Cheney Promises
^By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
no U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Europe without a superpower
agreement on conventional arms, the Dutch government said today.
   The comment followed news reports that quoted Cheney as saying
more troop reductions have been made possible by the continued
``erosion'' of the Soviet military threat in Europe. He reportedly
said this during his flight to the Netherlands from Washington.
   Cheney, who was scheduled to travel to Brussels for an annual
meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers,
was not immediately available for comment.
   The Dutch defense minister, Relus ter Beek, quoted Cheney as
saying he expected the Vienna-based talks on Conventional Forces in
Europe to be followed by another round of disarmament negotiations
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``Withdrawal of ... American troops from the European continent
will take place (only) after a (conventional arms) agreement,'' the
Dutch official told reporters after meeting with Cheney for several
hours Sunday and today.
   Ter Beek said he was promised by Cheney that the Pentagon's
plans for cutting $150 billion to $180 billion over the next five
years would not affect the NATO alliance before a conventional arms
agreement is concluded.
   The conventional arms talks are aimed at achieving parity
between the number of troops deployed in Europe by NATO and the
Warsaw Pact.
   Cheney said he expected further troop reductions once a
conventional arms agreement is completed, probably some time next
year, according to Ter Beek.
   A conventional arms agreement would include withdrawal of at
least some of the 300,000 U.S. troops stationed in Europe as well
as reductions in the number of soldiers and conventional weaponry
being deployed by the other NATO allies. Most of the U.S. troops
are in West Germany.
   ``We were very pleased to hear that the U.S. secretary also
assumed ... an initial agreement in Vienna will be followed'' by
another round of talks aimed at further conventional troop
reductions, Ter Beek said.
   The Dutch official said he and Cheney also discussed the swift
movement for democratic change in Eastern Europe, including
Czechoslovakia, where demonstrations have resulted in the ouster of
several hard-line Communist leaders.
   Ter Beek said the two agreed on the need for ``full support for
perestroika,'' Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of restructuring the
Soviet political and economic system.

   British journalist John McCarthy today turned 33
years old in captivity, his fourth birthday since he was taken
hostage in Lebanon.
   Friends appealed to the government for greater efforts to free
McCarthy, and they released eight white doves outside the Foreign
Office.
   ``The doves are symbolic of peace. We are releasing them as a
gesture of freedom in the hope of galvanizing the Foreign Office to
do more,'' said McCarthy's girlfriend, Jill Morrell.
   McCarthy's friends and relatives also placed a large
advertisement in a Beirut newspaper appealing for his release.
   McCarthy, who works for Worldwide Television News, disappeared
after being seized on the road to Beirut airport on his way home
April 17, 1986.
   He is one of four Britons missing in Lebanon. A total of 18
Westerners, including eight Americans, are held there, most by
pro-Iranian groups.
   ``John has obviously suffered 3{ years of torture,'' Miss
Morrell said. ``I know he will have found some way of coping with
it because John has a strong character, but I can't imagine how he
keeps sane. I don't think I could have done that.''
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized March 16,
1985.

   Sirens howled and church bells
rang today as millions of people observed a nationwide general
strike and filled streets and city squares in the largest
demonstration so far against Communist rule.
   Wenceslas Square in central Prague was jammed with hundreds of
thousands of flag-waving workers marching beneath the banners of
their factories, firms and offices.
   ``We don't want you anymore!'' the crowd roared in a chant that
echoed off the high 19th-century buildings surrounding the square,
a half-mile long boulevard.
   In a frenzied effort to avert the two-hour strike, seen as a
referendum on demands for their ouster, the country's Communist
leaders early today dumped three more hard-liners from the ruling
Politburo. They feared the strike would draw workers to the
pro-democracy movement, which was launched by students,
intellectuals and artists.
   They also endorsed a ``dialogue'' with the opposition and agreed
to a parliamentary inquiry of the brutal police crackdown on a
peaceful student rally Nov. 17 that touched off the East bloc's
latest popular revolt. And the state news agency said the
government had lifted most forms of censorship.
   The concessions followed unprecedented talks Sunday between
opposition leaders and Communist premier Ladislav Adamec, who later
joined reformer Alexander Dubcek at the head of a rally and told
about 300,000 demonstrators that authorities were ready to listen
to their demands.
   Demands for free elections and an end to one-party rule were
plastered over the windows of shops, hotels and restaurants that
shut down for the strike, which began at noon (6 a.m. EST).
   State-run television, which has played a key role in the
dizzyingly rapid popular revolt here, broadcast footage from
industrial centers around the country, showing crowds of hundreds
of thousands attending strike rallies.
   At the largest enterprise in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, the
company's radio even issued instructions on how to go about the
strike, television said.
   Huge crowds of strikers were seen in Bratislava, the east Slovak
industrial center of Kosice, the mining center of Ostrava on the
Polish border, and in Usti nad Labem, the heart of industrial north
Bohemia.
   There was no estimate of how many workers went on strike, but
the television footage and the crowds in Prague suggested the
strike was a major success for the opposition.
   State radio said all enterprises were affected, although most
had skeleton crews on duty so production would not be completely
disrupted.
   ``It has to go to the very end,'' said Jana Cervenkova, one of
those protesting on Wenceslas Square. ``As long as the Communists
rule, it is going to be as messed up as it was for the last 40
years.''
   ``Look Gustav, how thick the crowd is!'' the masses chanted,
referring to President Gustav Husak, who headed the crackdown on
democratic reforms that Dubcek tried to institute in 1968.
   ``Dubcek to the Castle!'' they yelled, referring to the
presidential residence. Husak replaced Dubcek in 1969.
   Sirens wailed and church bells pealed across the land at noon to
signal the start of the strike.
   People jangled keys and rang little bells of their own in a
symbolic signal to the Communists that their time in power is up.
   ``The last bell is ringing, the fairy tale is over!'' they
chanted.
   A radio announcer called the strike ``the highest form of ...
struggle'' for democracy and said it had been made necessary
because ``of the mistakes of the regime.''
   Later, a representative of the Student Strike Committee that
initiated the protest proclaimed on the radio that protests, which
began 11 days ago, would continue until a clause enshrining the
Communists' leading role is struck from the constitution.
   Czechoslovakia is the latest East bloc country to be caught up
in the reforms avocated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The mass protests began nearly two weeks ago and have resulted in
the ouster of a number of leaders, including Czechoslovakia's
Communist Party chief, Milos Jakes.
   State television announced it reduced its workforce for today's
strike, and the foreign language service of the CTK news agency
reported it would stop transmission for 15 minutes in a symbolic
gesture of solidarity.
   Radio carried interviews from numerous factories, hospitals and
enterprises with officials also expressing their solidarity.
   ``I waited, like you, a long time for this,'' Valter Komarek,
head of the Forecasting Institute of the Academy of Sciences, told
workers at the Vysocany plant in Prague.
   Removed today from the Politburo were Miroslav Stepan, who
resigned as Prague party boss Saturday, trade union boss Miroslav
Zavadil, and Josef Lenart, the longest-serving Politburo member.
   Their ouster and the addition of seven, largely unknown
Politburo members left an untried 13-man ruling party body whose
longest serving member, Slovak party chief Ignac Janak, joined in
April 1988. On Friday, seven Politburo members were ousted, but
activists had demanded further personnel changes and have expressed
skepticism the new Politburo is willing to bow to demands that the
Communists relinquish power.
   New party chief Karel Urbanek is one of just three on the
13-member Politburo to have survived the recent shake-ups.
   On Sunday night, he pledged for the first time to open a
dialogue with all levels of society _ including opposition groups
and Communist Party members ousted after Dubcek's failed reform
movement.

   Surgeons today undertook the nation's first liver
transplant from a living donor _ a mother who's giving a third of
her liver to her 21-month-old daughter.
   If successful, the operation at the University of Chicago would
provide a solution to a severe shortage of organs for children who
need transplants, doctors said.
   More than 700 babies a year in the United States need liver
transplants, and as many as half die for lack of a donor.
   Teri Smith, 29, was rolled into surgery at 7:35 a.m. to begin
the operation in which the left lobe of her liver was to be
transplanted in her daughter, Alyssa, said a spokeswoman at Wyler
Children's Hospital at the University of Chicago.
   ``She was as eager to get started as she was a month ago when we
first proposed this to her,'' hospital spokeswoman Mary Fetsch said
today. ``She has not displayed any signs of doubt or hesitation.''
   Dr. Christoph Broelsch led the surgical team in a two-phase
operation that began with removal of a portion of Mrs. Smith's
liver, said Ms. Fetsch. About 3{ hours into the mother's operation,
doctors planned to prepare her daughter for the transplant. The
entire procedure was expected to last eight to nine hours.
   ``In a way I kind of fear for her, but I'm confident everything
will turn out OK,'' said Alyssa's father, John L. Smith, 27, of the
San Antonio suburb of Shertz, Texas.
   Alyssa suffers from an often-fatal liver disorder called biliary
atresia. The disease blocks liver bile ducts, backing up bile in
the bloodstream and the liver, and is the leading cause for liver
transplants involving children.
   Until now, the only regularly performed living donor transplants
have involved kidneys and some pancreas segments.
   Liver transplants from living donors have been performed only
three times _ in Brazil, Australia and Japan. One child has died.
   In those cases, the operation were emergencies performed on
critically ill children, said Dr. Peter Whitington, head of the
University of Chicago's pediatric liver transplant program. The
Chicago hospital has spent more than a year planning the program,
and last August authorized 20 such operations to determine if the
procedure is viable.
   Dr. William D. Paine, who directs the liver transplant program
at the University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, said
transplant specialists around the country were closely monitoring
today's operation.
   Because cadaver livers are usually from adults, they are too
large to be transplanted into children's small abdominal cavities.
   ``Small children are at risk of dying while waiting for a
suitable cadaver donor,'' said Whitington.
   Alyssa had been waiting for a cadaver liver transplant for more
than a year when the Smiths heard about the University of Chicago's
plans for the experimental program in August.
   ``It's a waiting game when you are waiting for a liver,'' said
Mrs. Smith, a fourth-grade teacher. ``You don't know if she's going
to have a bout with some illness that causes her to go into a liver
failure and a liver not be available at that time.''
   The Chicago hospital has been a pioneer in liver transplants.
Broelsch became the first surgeon in the United States to
transplant part of a liver from a cadaver into a child in 1986.
Last year, he performed a ``two-for-one'' operation, in which two
children received transplants from one cadaver liver.
   Whitington said the living donor transplant ``is just the next
step in assuring a steady supply of liver grafts.''
   He said the procedure holds the promise of a lower rejection
rate since the grafts would come from a close relative, match
better genetically and could be transplanted immediately. Also, the
operation could be performed electively before a child becomes
critically ill.
   Before authorizing the program, the university studied ethical
considerations and decided that the risk to the donor was low,
Whitington said.
   The liver regenerates itself _ an adult liver will grow back to
normal after the operation, and the segment transplanted into an
infant will grow with the child.
   Whitington said the hospital's guidelines stress that no
pressure be applied on family members to be donors.
   ``The only thing I wish is that they could say, `Yes, this will
work,''' said Mrs. Smith. ``There is a possibility it will not be a
100 percent success. But we realize her chances should be better.''

<HEAD>Californian Loses Challenge to OK of Kennedy to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a Hollywood, Calif., man who sued the Senate Judiciary Committee
over its unanimous vote last year favoring Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy's appointment to the high court.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out
Monte Lee's lawsuit.
   Kennedy did not participate in considering Lee's appeal or in
the court's action today.
   Lee's suit contended that the committee's 14 senators violated
his rights by voting for Kennedy without investigating allegations
of wrongdoing against the nominee.
   Lee's allegations arose from Kennedy's participation in 1986 as
a member of a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in a ruling
unfavorable to Lee. According to court documents, Lee had been
challenging the doctrine of judicial immunity in the case.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's unanimous vote was taken Jan.
27, 1988. The full Senate confirmed then-President Reagan's
nomination of Kennedy by a 97-0 vote Feb. 3, 1988.
   A federal trial judge dismissed Lee's lawsuit, and the dismissal
was upheld by a 9th Circuit court panel last June 5.
   The appeals court said the senators are absolutely immune, under
the Constitution's speech and debate clause, from being sued over
their alleged failure to investigate Kennedy properly.
   The case is Lee vs. Biden, 89-591.

   Kentucky law enforcement officials sued for
strip-searching a woman charged with operating her car without
proper registration or insurance lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that
strip-searching people accused of minor traffic violations
generally violates their rights.
   Karen Masters pleaded not guilty Aug. 21, 1986, to driving her
car with expired registration plates and failure to maintain auto
insurance.
   She was ordered to return to court on Oct. 23 and was given a
card to remind her of that date. By mistake, the judge recorded
Mrs. Masters' next scheduled appearance as Oct. 16.
   Jefferson County police officers arrested Mrs. Masters at her
home Oct. 21 for failure to appear in court on Oct. 16.
   After police dropped off her two young children with Mrs.
Masters' mother, they handcuffed Mrs. Masters and took her to jail.
   A female attendant frisked her and ordered her to open her
blouse in front of a window and in view of other people. About four
hours later she was taken to another room where she was ordered by
another female attendant to take off all her clothes for a more
thorough search.
   After putting on a jail dress, Mrs. Masters was placed in a cell
with other prisoners. She was not released until later that evening.
   Throughout her ordeal, Mrs. Masters repeatedly protested that
her arrest was a mistake. She showed police her ``reminder card''
as evidence she had not failed to report for her court date.
   Mrs. Masters later sued four police officers and the head of the
county corrections department for allegedly violating her rights.
   The law enforcement officials said they should be immune from
such a suit, largely because of a 1985 court consent decree that
settled an unrelated case involving overcrowding at the county jail.
   The decree authorized strip searches of inmates at the jail when
they are transferred from one area to another.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last April rejected the
county officials' arguments aimed at killing Mrs. Masters' suit.
   ``We have found no authority approving a practice of conducting
a strip search of a person arrested for a simple traffic violation
in the absence of at least reasonable suspicion that the person
might be carrying a weapon, illegal drugs or other contraband,''
the appeals court said.
   The consent decree did not give the police power to ignore
clearly established principles protecting rights of people accused
of minor traffic offenses, the appeals court said.
   The case is Frey vs. Masters, 89-576.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Continues Search for Five Missing Fishermen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard intensified its search this
morning for five missing fishermen after a cutter and a jet spotted
white flares in the area where the lobster boat disappeared.
   The men, aboard the 72-foot Heidi Marie out of Stonington,
Conn., were reported missing Wednesday after they failed to call
the boat's owner, James P. Garbo.
   The Coast Guard found fishing markers from the lobster boat
Friday and identified an emergency floating radio beacon as
belonging to the vessel.
   Petty Officer Elizabeth Brannan said the cutter spotted a white
flare about midnight Sunday, prompting rescuers to launch a
nighttime jet search about 200 miles south of Nantucket.
   ``The jet sighted a flare, but ... while they were searching
they weren't able to confirm the source before having to turn back
to refuel,'' Brannan said.
   The hunt was stepped up early today and, in addition to the two
cutters on the scene, it included five jets from as far away as
North Carolina that would cover 8,400 square miles of ocean, she
said.
   Petty Officer Ellen Harrington said it was not known if the
flares were related to the missing vessel, adding that ``white
flares are not generally considered distress flares, but we have to
consider that they are.''
   Officer Jack Mason described Sunday's effort as a ``full-blown''
search, using Navy aircraft from Massachusetts, Maine, New York and
North Carolina, as well as the two 270-foot cutters from Boston.
   There were no immediate plans end the search for the fishermen,
Mason said. ``We go as long as we feel there's reasonable hope,''
he said.
   Coast Guard officials have said there was still some reason to
believe there could be survivors. The vessel was equipped with a
high-quality inflatable covered life raft that held up to eight
people.
   During the five days of searching, rescuers have used
sophisticated equipment and special flare searches while
criss-crossing 10,000 square miles of sea under mostly fair weather
conditions and good visibility.
   Garbo declined comment Sunday through his attorney, Tom Clinton.
He has not yet spoken publicly about the incident, although his
wife said he is in constant touch with the Coast Guard.
   The crew members were identified as Michael Hare, Capt. Mark
Middleton, 33; Ray Gould, Arthur Banks and Ray Morris, all in their
twenties, the Coast Guard said.

   There's a cold front bearing down on Malta,
the Mediterranean island where President Bush and Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev are going this weekend to warm up their
relationship.
   It could rain on their sail, according to the weather forecast.
   Big-time summits at sea are like that. The last time there wa
   A lot of planning goes into such a meeting, but things still go
wrong. The Churchill-Roosevelt meeting in Placentia Bay in August
of 1941, is an example. At that meeting, the two leaders drafted
the Atlantic Charter _ a policy of aid to Great Britain at a time
when the United States was neither legally nor emotionally
committed to full participation in the war against Germany.
   It was the forerunner of many such other meetings between
leaders. Churchill brought not only a large delegation of military
men to the meeting, but also 90 grouse.
   In the 1969 book ``The First Summit'' Theodore A. Wilson writes
that HMS Prince of Wales arrived at the meeting point with Marines
and a band arrayed on the quarterdeck and everyone on board in
place for welcoming ceremonies.
   ``The battleship made a sudden burn to starboard, and to
everyone's surprise headed out to sea,'' wrote Wilson. There had
been a mixup about time zones and the ship was 90 minutes too early.
   ``The prime minister was furious and banged about the main deck
hunting a target for his wrath,'' Wilson wrote, but nothing could
be done except to steam in a great circle. All of this was hidden
in morning mist.
   ``Then dramatically, the mist broke to reveal a dazzling
panorama,'' he continued. ``The camouflaged British warship, a
White Ensign stirring over its stern, found itself in the midst of
many other armed ships, of all sizes and shapes, all displaying the
Stars and Stripes, their decks lined with cheering seamen.
   ``Overhead droned American patrol planes. On the deck of the
British battleship their pilots could discern a pudgy figure in
some kind of naval uniform. A United States heavy cruiser just a
short distance away bore on its quarterdeck another figure, sitting
patiently in a wheelchair.''

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact Ordinance Restricting Ownership of Pit Bulls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact an
Overland Park, Kan., ordinance restricting the ownership and
possession of ``pit bull dogs.''
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague.
   Lawyers for 13 owners of dogs told the justices the 1987
ordinance ``does not even attempt to offer a standard for the
police or dog owners to use when trying to determine whether a
particular dog is subject to the ordinance.''
   ``Anti-pit bull laws and ordinances are now sweeping the
country,'' the appeal said, ``and constitutional challenges on
vagueness grounds have been mounted in dozens of counties and
states, with inconsistent results. This ordinance is among the very
worst offenders.''
   The appeal said trial judges in California, Florida, Minnesota
and Washington state have struck down anti-pit bull ordinances for
being too vaguely worded.
   The Overland Park ordinance deems pit bull dogs ``dangerous
animals'' that must be kept indoors or restrained and muzzled at
all times.
   Pit bull dogs are defined by the ordinance to include
Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers,
American Pit Bull Terriers, or dogs that ``have the appearance and
characteristics of being predominantly of (those) breeds of dogs.''
   The ordinance also requires pit bull owners to acquire a $50,000
liability insurance policy to compensate for any damage caused by
the animals. Owners who fail to comply may be criminally liable,
and could face substantial fines and up to 30 days in jail.
   A state judge and the Kansas Supreme Court upheld the ordinance.
   Noting in its ruling last April 4 that no constitutionally
protected conduct is being limited, the state Supreme Court said
the ordinance is worded precisely enough.
   ``The ordinance, as interpreted by the Overland Park Police
Department, applies only to animals in which pit bull dog
characteristics predominate,'' the state court said. ``Ultimate,
god-like precision is not required.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the dog owners said
the ordinance ``on its face lacks even a rudimentary core meaning.''
   The case is Hearn vs. Overland Park, 89-412.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected appeals by
four men and a woman convicted for their roles in a hoodlum gang,
the Westies, in the Hell's Kitchen section of New York City.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the five
were prosecuted fairly.
   Convicted of racketeering and related charges were James Coonan
and Edna Coonan, James McElroy, Richard Ritter and William Bokun.
   Prosecutors described Coonan as the ringleader of an underworld
group that terrorized the Manhattan neighborhood for 20 years until
the mid-1980s.
   Coonan was sentenced to 75 years in prison and fined $1 million;
his wife received a 15-year sentence and $200,000 fine; McElroy was
sentenced to 60 years, Ritter to 40 years and Bokun to 50 years.
   The Westies were involved in murders, kidnapping, extortion,
loansharking, gambling and drug distribution, the government said.
Three victims were dismembered and their bodies dumped into the
East River.
   Prosecutors said Coonan supervised the gang even while serving a
prison sentence for murder. They said his wife ran the Westies'
loansharking operation and relayed messages from the jailed Coonan
to his subordinates.
   McElroy was described as a chief enforcer, Bokun as a killer and
cocaine dealer and Ritter as a cocaine dealer and loanshark.
   In the appeal acted on today, the Coonans said they were
convicted largely on the basis of hearsay and gossip. They said
while Coonan was in prison other gang members falsely boasted they
had committed crimes with him to intimidate victims.
   Ritter said police illegally searched his apartment. Bokun said
he was denied adequate legal representation after his attorney was
forced to withdraw eight weeks into the trial because of illness.
   McElroy and Edna Coonan said they were denied a fair trial
because the judge barred a psychiatrist from testifying about the
mental illness of a prosecution witness.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions in
May.
   The cases are Coonan vs. U.S., 89-379; Ritter vs. U.S., 89-5497;
Bokun vs. U.S., 89-5512; McElroy vs. U.S., 89-5601.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Colorado Telephone Company Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a telephone company ordered to notify customers, along with their
monthly bills, of their right to join a lawsuit against the company.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Colorado ruling that the
company's free-speech rights are not violated by requiring it to
include such notices with its bills.
   The case stems from a suit accusing Mountain States Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., or Mountain Bell, of antitrust violations.
   Five individuals and a corporation sued on behalf of Mountain
Bell's 1.2 million residential and 235,000 business customers in
Colorado.
   The Federal Communications Commission in 1982 ordered Mountain
Bell to offer customers a choice of whether they wanted to continue
paying the company to maintain telephone wiring within their home
or business.
   The telephone company notified customers it would assume they
wished to continue the service unless told otherwise.
   The suit against Mountain Bell said that tactic violated
antitrust law by misleading customers. The suit seeks to force the
company to refund fees paid for wiring maintenance.
   The average claim per customer would be between $35 and $50.
   A state judge said that because the suit is in behalf of all
Mountain Bell's Colorado customers _ a class-action claim _ all
customers must be given a chance to take part or exclude themselves.
   That decision entails risk. If Mountain Bell wins the case, any
customer who chose to participate would be required to share in
paying the legal costs.
   The state judge ordered customers be notified of their options
along with monthly bills from the company.
   Those who sued Mountain Bell said it would cost them $500,000 if
the notices were mailed separately but only $300,000 if the notices
were included in the bills.
   The Colorado Supreme Court in July upheld the order that the
notices be sent with the monthly bills.
   ``There is no danger ... that a customer would somehow construe
the notice as an endorsement by Mountain Bell of the class action
or a concession on its part that the pending lawsuit has merit,''
the state court said. ``The notice merely provides class members
with objectively neutral information.''
   The state court rejected arguments that the notice procedure
conflicts with a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
   The justices in that case allowed a California utility company
to exclude from its billing envelopes messages by a consumer
protection group.
   The Colorado court said Mountain Bell's case is different
because the notice of the lawsuit ``is devoid of economic,
ideological or political advocacy. What we are dealing with here is
a legal notice.''
   Mountain Bell's appeal was supported by numerous banking, credit
card, gasoline and utility companies.
   The case is Mountain States Telephone vs. District Court of
Denver, 89-531.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist Party today
criticized its 2.3 million-member youth organization for breaking
away and said the leadership in Czechoslovakia was paying ``a
bitter price'' for resisting reform.
   The official party newspaper Neues Deutschland said the decision
by the Freie Deutsche Jugend, or Free German Youth, to abandon the
party could threaten the youth group's future.
   The group, the traditional stepping stone to success for the
Communist leadership, including party chief Egon Krenz, announced
Friday it no longer wanted to be the ``helper and fighting
reserve'' of the party.
   In a commentary, Neues Deutschland spoke of a ``loss of
confidence'' in the youth group, which it said is ``struggling for
a new profile and perhaps for its existence.''
   Another Communist-run daily, the Berliner Zeitung, offered East
Germany's harshest criticism to date of Czechoslovakia's rulers,
saying they were paying ``the bitter price for the grave errors of
the past.''
   The commentary traced the troubles of the party leadership in
Prague to refusing political reforms and to ``the illusory, risky
business of trying to choke the call for democracy with police
clubs 10 days ago.''
   It was referring to the police crackdown on demonstrators in
Prague on Nov. 17. The severity of the crackdown sparked an
unprecedented series of protest that has forced the ouster of
hard-line Communists, including party chief Milos Jakes.
   The National Democrats, one of the smaller parties long allied
with the Communists, appealed today for a ``more effective and more
humane socialism'' in East Germany.
   The comments by party leader Fred Dumke echoed Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's remarks Sunday in Pravda. Gorbachev's
statement was seen as an endorsement of the 1968 ``Prague Spring''
slogan of ``socialism with a human face,'' adopted anew by
pro-democracy protesters in Czechoslovakia.
   In another sign of the East German party's own problems,
Communist sources said Sunday that huge amounts of money earned
from Communist Party-owned businesses in East Germany are
unaccounted for.
   Party reformers have urged an inquiry to determine if the
revenues were diverted, the sources said.
   The charges of revenue diversion concern money earned at
businesses, including trading firms and hard-currency shops, set up
to earn West German marks and other foreign currency, the party
sources said Sunday on condition of anonymity.
   Earnings of the roughly 100 companies total from $3.8 billion to
$6.5 billion per year, much of which is unaccounted for, the
sources said.
   ``These companies have misappropriated money that belongs to the
people,'' one source said.
   The party sources said several high-ranking reform-minded
Communists, whose names were not disclosed, have called for an
investigation to determine where the money went.
   The enterprises included electronics and transport companies and
an art trading company, among many others, the party sources said.
   They said the enterprises include the East Berlin company
Intrac, specializing in trade in chemicals and metals, and a
company identified only as one ``for internal and foreign trade in
radioactive and stable isotopes.''
   Such an investigation would be only the latest show of
discontent with the party.
   The party has lost about 200,000 people _ or 10 percent of its
membership _ in the past two months, Neues Deutschland quoted
Central Committee member Heinz Mirtschin as saying in its weekend
edition.
   Krenz, facing a battle for his political career at a party
congress next month, has been trying to shift attention to abuses
that can be blamed on his predecessor, Erich Honecker.
   Krenz, however, was a member of Honecker's inner circle and
former chief of the country's security apparatus.
   Honecker was ousted Oct. 18 and replaced by Krenz, who has
presided over the opening of the Berlin Wall and an official
commitment to reform.
   Among Krenz's moves toward power-sharing have been to propose
``round-table'' talks with the opposition, similar to the
discussions that led to dramatic political changes in Hungary and
Poland.

   A 4-month-old boy caught in a fight between two
men, one who was raising the child and the other who said he was
the infant's natural father, died after being struck by a section
of pipe, police said.
   Daniel Jorgenson was killed Saturday after a man barged into an
apartment, claiming to be the infant's father, said police Sgt.
Mary Wrensen.
   ``They were fighting and the baby was in the middle,'' the boy's
mother, Diane Jorgenson, told reporters.
   Wrensen said 25-year-old Juan Nogueras forced his way into the
apartment where the child lived with his mother and Alfredo Acosta,
39.
   Nogueras grabbed the boy and then ran outside with the child.
   Acosta chased him, wielding a 3-foot-long pipe, Wrensen said.
   ``Acosta struck Nogueras in the head and also struck the baby,
killing the baby,'' Wrensen said.
   Nogueras was charged with burglary but any other charges in the
case will be considered by the Brooklyn district attorney's office,
she said.
   It was not clear who was the child's father, the officer said.

   Authorities have charged the first inmate
in connection with a three-day-long riot last month at a
medium-security state prison that injured nearly 125 people and
caused extensive damage.
   William Diggs, 25, was arraigned on a variety of charges,
including kidnapping and making terroristic threats, Cumberland
County District Attorney J. Michael Eakin said today. Charges
against other inmates will be filed within several weeks, Eakin
said.
   Officials didn't release any details of any alleged activities
by Diggs during the riot Oct. 25-27 at the 52-acre prison about
five miles west of Harrisburg.
   Eakin said he filed the charges against Diggs, serving time for
robbery, on Friday to prevent the inmate's scheduled release
Saturday. Diggs remains incarcerated in lieu of $500,000 bail.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's party
today failed to win a majority in elections for only the second
time in 42 years as voters deserted it for a new centrist alliance
and a fundamentalist Hindu party.
   Incomplete results from the election for a new Parliament showed
the Congress Party with more seats than any single opposition group
but far short of a mandate to form the next government alone.
   That leaves Gandhi in the difficult position of trying to form a
coalition government _ the first in the history of the world's most
populous democracy.
   The fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, capitalizing on a
rise in Hindu nationalism, appeared destined to be the pivotal
player. Its leader said today he would ``see to it that they
(Congress) fall from power.''
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman dissolved Parliament tonight,
the first formal step toward seating a new Parliament. Gandhi is
now a caretaker prime minister until his party or the opposition
manage to form a new government.
   The election was a major blow to Gandhi, who had been tainted by
allegations of government corruption and ineptitude. His family
dynasty has governed India for all but five years since it won
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Gandhi's leadership also had been called into question by the
widespread vote fraud and violence in the election that claimed 137
lives, making it the bloodiest balloting in modern India's history.
   The election for seats in Parliament's policy-making lower house
started Wednesday and was scheduled to end Sunday, but re-voting
was ordered in some districts because of alleged fraud. Balloting
ended today, and by sundown winners were declared in 373 of the 525
races.
   State television, compiling results from the Election
Commission, said the Congress Party had 160 seats. Its party allies
had 17.
   A majority in the new Parliament _ and with it the mandate to
form a new government _ requires 263 seats.
   The centrist National Front, a five-party alliance led by former
defense and finance minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh, had 81 seats.
Singh, an ex-Congress Party member, was once Gandhi's ally but is
now the prime minister's most outspoken political foe.
   The Bharatiya Janata, which won just two seats in the last
elections in 1984, had 69. The rest of the seats went to smaller
parties and independents.
   Many undeclared seats are in states where the National Front was
expected to do well.
   The Congress Party's poor showing could hurt it in the search
for coalition partners or trigger a revolt against the prime
minister by colleagues in his own party.
   ``If Congress wants to win anything, the prime minister must
go,'' said independent analyst Bhabani Sen Gupta. ``With Rajiv
Gandhi, very few things are possible. Without Rajiv Gandhi, many
things are possible.''
   The Congress Party dismissed the possibility of a coalition with
the Bharatiya Janata Party.
   ``We will contemptuously reject any overtures from the BJP.
There's no question (of aligning with them),'' Congress spokesman
Anand Sharma said. ``Congress is not in a tearing hurry'' to seek a
coalition with anyone.
   India has never had a coalition government, and the prospect
plunged many into confusion. To create a coalition, the president
would ask the party with the most seats to try to muster enough
partners for a parliamentary majority. If that fails, the president
could ask another party to try to forge a majority in alliance with
other parties.
   Gandhi, 45, the grandson of India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru, was plunged into the leadership when his mother,
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated in 1984.
   His party then took an unprecedented 415 of the seats in the
lower house.
   The initial euphoria over a young, seemingly dynamic leader was
soon tarnished by allegations of government corruption and
ineptitude.
   The trouble came home to roost in Gandhi's own election district
of Amethi, where the outcome of his race for re-election is still
in limbo.
   Gandhi was expected to win easily when the remote area of dusty
villages voted on Wednesday. But the National Front complained of
widespread fraud by Congress Party activists, and another vote was
held today in about 18 percent of the district.
   Polling officer Uday Raj Pandey estimated more than 50 percent
of the voters showed up in Amethi.
   There were few issues in the campaign, apart from being for or
against Gandhi and the Congress.
   Another factor in the election was a revival of Hindu
fundamentalism.
   The surge followed Hindu-Moslem riots earlier this month that
left more than 300 people dead. The riots were sparked by a
campaign to build a temple on the site of a 16th century Moslem
mosque.
   Moslems voters also may have abandoned the Congress Party, their
traditional election choice, because the government did not prevent
the riots. Most of those who died were Moslems.
   Parliament's lower house has 543 seats, but only 524 were at
stake in the elections. No election was held for a seat with an
unopposed candidate.
   The elections for the rest of the seats were postponed
indefinitely because of incomplete voter lists or candidates'
deaths.

   A shooting possibly related to crack use and
an apparent murder-suicide broke Philadelphia's record for
homicides in a single year, authorities said.
   The murder became the city's 445th this year, breaking the
record of 444 set in 1974, when widespread gang violence inflated
the city's death tally.
   Thomas Svenningsen, 60, a retired police officer, and his wife,
Betty, 59, were found dead of gunshot wounds by a son just before
midnight Sunday, police said.
   Earlier Sunday, police responding to a call found David
Williams, 28, lying in the living room of a West Philadelphia
house. Williams, who had been shot once in the back and once in the
groin, was pronounced dead at a hospital.
   Two people who were inside the house were questioned by police,
who said there was evidence of crack use. No arrests were made,
police said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Schools Cut Off Help to Severely Handicapped
Children</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today refused to let public
schools cut off educational help to severely handicapped children
even though they may not be able to benefit from such services.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a New
Hampshire school district ordered to help a profoundly retarded
13-year-old boy.
   The case has attracted widespread attention from educators and
state and local government officials nationwide who supported the
appeal by the Rochester, N.H., school district.
   In other action today, the court:
   _ Dealt a blow to New York City's campaign to halt the spread of
homelessness by refusing to revive a local law successfully
challenged by developers.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling that a law
banning conversion or demolition of single-room-occupancy housing
unconstitutionally confiscates private property.
   _ Turned down an appeal by Kentucky law enforcement officials
sued for strip-searching a woman charged with operating her car
without proper registration or insurance.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that
strip-searching people accused of minor traffic violations
generally violates their rights.
   _ Left intact an Overland Park, Kan., ordinance restricting the
ownership and possession of ``pit bull dogs.''
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague.
   The boy in the handicapped-education case, identified as Timothy
W., has been severely handicapped since he was born two months
prematurely Dec. 8, 1975.
   Rochester school officials said he is incapable of learning even
rudimentary skills.
   ``Timothy has consistently exhibited profound mental and
developmental retardation, deafness and blindness, a persistent
convulsive disorder and severe cerebral palsy,'' they said. ``He is
virtually immobile, suffers from spasticity and has contracted
joints.''
   But the boy's mother and some therapists painted a somewhat
different picture. They said he sees bright light, smiles when
happy, cries when sad, listens to television and music, and
responds to touching and talking.
   At issue is the duty of states and local school officials under
the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which
provides federal aid and in turn requires programs to help such
children.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May that under
the law ``it is the state's responsibility to experiment, refine
and improve upon the educational services it provides to
handicapped children and not ... to exclude handicapped children if
there is no proof that they can benefit from the existing program
that a state might offer at a particular time.''
   A chief aim of the law is to help the most severely handicapped,
the appeals court said as it reinstated a lawsuit by Timothy's
mother seeking educational services and $175,000 in damages.
   Rochester school officials said the appeals court ruling means
states and cities will be forced to divert scarce resources from
those who can benefit to children who cannot be helped.
   They said the federal government contributes less than $300 to
the $15,000 a year it will take to provide educational services to
Timothy.
   Among those supporting the school officials' appeal in the
handicapped case were the National School Boards Association, the
American Association of School Administrators, the National League
of Cities and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   The school boards and school administrators, in a
friend-of-the-court brief, said the appeals court ruling could have
devastating consequences.
   They quoted therapist Lynn Miller, who at one time testified for
Timothy but said she since has changed her mind.
   To spend money and require teachers to help someone incapable of
learning ``is not only a misuse of money, it raises false hopes in
the children's families,'' she said. ``It results in a burnout in
teachers, therapists and social workers.''
   The case is Rochester, N.H., vs. Timothy W., 89-515.

<HEAD>Baltic Economic Autonomy Approved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators today gave final approval to a plan
putting the small Baltic republics on the road to economic autonomy
from Moscow next year and possibly issuing their own currencies.
   Deputies from the tiny republic of Estonia stood and cheered
after the Soviet Parliament approved the measure on a vote of
296-67. Another 37 deputies abstained.
   A final vote on the bill had been delayed from Friday after a
sharp debate on whether the move amounted to an effort to tear
apart the Soviet system.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev presided over the sessions Friday
and today and supported the bill as a step toward economic reform.
   The Tass news agency said the law goes into effect Jan. 1 and
gives Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia ``the right to engage in
independent economic activity and envisages equal participation in
union activity.''
   Baltic deputies stressed that the law gives them more control
over factories now controlled by government ministries based in
Moscow. They say it does not exclude the possibility of issuing
their own currencies.
   One deputy from the Soviet Far East, Nikolai Danilyuk, said
Friday he opposed the bill because ``I would not like to become a
participant in the disintegration of our great state.''
   But Estonian Prime Minister Indrik Toome said that only a
radical restructuring giving the republics more autonomy could save
the Soviet Union from disintegration that he said was caused by too
much control in Moscow.
   The law was given preliminary approval in July and sent to
legislative committees for further work.

   Cholesterol screenings in shopping malls and
other public settings can be dangerous because of an alarming
potential for inaccurate results and risk of infection, a federal
official said today.
   ``Given today's concern for the spread of AIDS and hepatitis,
these findings are particularly disturbing,'' Richard Kusserow,
inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services,
said in testimony presented to a House subcommittee.
   Kusserow said he was concerned that public screenings are
``growing by leaps and bounds. Private companies are jumping in,
manufacturers are promoting their products by saying anyone can use
them.'' And, he said, many screenings are conducted in ``a
carnival-like atmosphere.''
   Kusserow recommended federal regulation of all cholesterol
screenings that are not conducted by health care professionals.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, said he is
concerned that with inaccurate screening results, people ``can be
lulled into a false sense of security _ they may not see a doctor,
they may not change their diets and they may not exercise.''
   ``Over time, not knowing they are in the danger zone could cost
them their health and even their lives,'' Wyden said.
   An investigation by the inspector general, requested by Wyden's
panel, found that basic rules of hygiene were often ignored,
qualifications and training of testers varied widely and public
screenings often lacked the optimal conditions needed to produce
accurate results with portable analyzers.
   ``The public in general is not aware of these shortcomings, and
does not know what to look for in safe, high-quality public
screening programs,'' said the report.
   ``In addition, screening staff may be placing themselves as well
as screenees at risk due to marginal observation of the basic rules
of hygiene and infection control procedures,'' the report said.
   Cholesterol screenings are conducted at shopping malls,
pharmacies, health clubs, village halls and a variety of other
public settings. The report said it found no reliable national
statistics on prevalence of screenings but said that because of
greater awareness of the link between high cholesterol and heart
disease, ``demand for screening is increasing significantly.''
   ``At a time when over 60 million adult Americans may currently
have high blood cholesterol, placing them at risk of heart disease,
it defies common sense to allow unregulated public screening to
continue,'' Wyden said.
   His subcommittee has been studying medical testing, and its
finding that a quarter of all such testing was being done in
unregulated settings led to a 1988 law that brings all clinical
laboratories under federal regulation. The Health Care Financing
Administration is drafting regulations to implement the law.
   The law provides that some medical testing may be exempt from
its provisions, but the inspector general recommended public
screenings be included in the regulations because ``federal
regulation ... is clearly called for in order to safeguard the
public.''
   Sixteen states regulate public cholesterol screening, but
regulations in four of them have not yet been implemented, the
report said.
   The report was based on a review of state and federal laws and
regulations, research studies and reports as well as interviews
with 250 experts and public officials. It also included a special
field survey in which investigators participated in 71 public
cholesterol screenings that were randomly selected in 10 states and
the District of Columbia.
   The investigators' test results were not analyzed for accuracy,
but participants observed the conditions under which the tests were
conducted and rated them against the guidelines issued by the
National Cholesterol Education Program, a consortium of
organizations coordinated by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute.
   Investigators said that contrary to the guidelines, the
atmosphere at many screenings was frenzied, with little or no
privacy for those being tested, and that many times testers had no
professional experience and minimal training.
   Nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood was drawn
with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or ``milked,'' which
can dilute the sample with material from between the cells and give
a lower than true result.
   Also, the investigators reported that a third of the testers
wore no gloves. Some who wore no gloves handled money and collected
blood samples.
   Though investigators did not see any lancets being reused, one
reported that ``at a pharmacy, staff were observed inspecting
lancets lying on the table because they were afraid they had put a
used one back in with the new ones.''
   Contrary to the NCEP guidelines, less than 20 percent of the
investigators who were screened were told that screening is only a
guide to potential problems and not a diagnostic test.
   The investigators also reported that while hospitals conducting
screenings frequently provided physician referrals, for-profit
screeners ``rarely even mentioned referral.''

<HEAD>Investigator Finds Thousands of People Buried in Used Graves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An archaeologist says as many as 48,000
people might be buried in previously occupied graves at two
cemeteries.
   ``It may be beyond the abilities of most people to comprehend
just what has gone on out here,'' said Phil DiBlasi, an
archaeologist who has excavated about 100 graves at Eastern and
Greenwood cemeteries during an investigation for the state attorney
general's office.
   Some graves were found to contain the remains of as many as six
people, and graves containing the remains of three or four are ``a
common occurrence,'' DiBlasi said.
   Remains from previous burials were found so often in a section
of Eastern Cemetery that about 70 infants' bodies were buried only
10 to 18 inches deep in an effort to avoid bones, employees have
told investigators.
   The investigation has led to the indictment of three employees
who ran the Louisville Crematory and Cemeteries Co. Inc.
   A Jefferson County grand jury returned a 60-count indictment
against the company in July. Also indicted were Charles Alexander
Jr., the executive director since May 1986; Clifford B. Amos Sr.,
the board president who had been acting executive director from
1980 to 1986; and Robert Copley, vice president of the board, who
began working for the company in October 1987.
   All three men have resigned and all have pleaded innocent to the
charges.
   They are to be tried in February on charges that include the
reuse of graves and abuse of corpses. If convicted, they could
receive prison terms ranging from 188 to 268 years, plus fines of
up to $4,000.
   DiBlasi said his excavations during the last four months
indicated that graves were being reused as early as the mid-1920s
in Eastern Cemetery.
   Cemetery records indicate it was probably full shortly after the
turn of the century.
   Comprising 15 acres, Eastern had enough room for about 18,000
bodies under existing cemetery-industry standards. But an estimated
51,000 bodies have been buried there, meaning 33,000 were
improperly buried, according to DiBlasi and a report by another
investigator filed in the court case.
   The report of Jim Caldwell, an investigator for the attorney
general's office, also estimated that about 15,000 too many bodies
were buried at Greenwood.
   The 141-year-old cemetery company came under scrutiny in May,
when Bob Allen, a grave-digger and maintenance worker for eight
years, called the attorney general's office to report the alleged
burial practices, Caldwell's report said.
   During the subsequent investigation, Caldwell found human bones
stored throughout Eastern Cemetery _ in a truck's glove
compartment, in a tool box, in a storage shed, in dirt piles and
even in a fast food hamburger bag, his report said.

<HEAD>Judge To Decide Who First Saw Knapsack With $10,900</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simple case of a knapsack stuffed with
$10,900 that was found in a private yard has turned into a four-way
court battle that is full of contradictions and suspicions.
   The knapsack turned up on May 1, 1986, behind the home of David
and Lona Stussy, the first party claiming the money.
   Stussy says he saw the knapsack between 6 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.
that day when he left for work. He said he was in a rush, so he
didn't look inside it but called from his office and asked his wife
to check it out.
   Mrs. Stussy apparently didn't rush to look at the strange pack
lying in her back yard. But a live-in babysitter, Kathleen Jensen,
says she spotted it when taking out the garbage.
   Then she and Mrs. Stussy took a closer look.
   Mrs. Stussy says she immediately saw loose bills, but didn't see
all of the cash and didn't mention it at the time.
   Jensen says she didn't notice any money in the bag until after
police picked it up later that morning. She is not making any claim
on the money.
   Claimant No. 2 is the Stussys' former live-in handyman, Jerry
Moore, who says he found the knapsack after midnight, long before
the Stussys got up.
   However, Moore saw no money, only what looked like burglary
tools, and says he was stunned when lawyers told him more than a
year later that cash was found in the pack.
   In any event, Stussy eventually called police and when officer
John E. Pielow arrived he looked in the bag and found $10,900 in a
brown gunnysack.
   In Minnesota, the law allows finders to become keepers if six
months pass without anyone claiming lost property. After the
deadline passed, the Stussys filed a claim.
   Enter claimant No. 3. The Minneapolis Police Relief Association,
the police pension fund, decided it wanted the money. Under law, if
an officer finds money that doesn't get claimed, the money goes
into the pension fund.
   The association insists officer Pielow is the legal finder of
the money because he was the first to look inside.
   Then the fourth contestant, Nowell Freeman, stepped forward.
   Freeman, a cabinetmaker and real estate agent in suburban
Wayzata, insists the money and the knapsack were stolen from his
car April 30, 1986, when he parked it near the Stussys' home to
walk a girlfriend around Lake of the Isles.
   Freeman has some solid evidence to back up his claim _ a police
report he made on the night of the theft. The report describes the
pack right down to the brand name.
   But even Freeman's claim contains a discrepancy, because the
police report says he originally claimed a theft of $4,000 in cash,
which he says was for a down payment on real estate. He now claims
that much more cash was stolen.
   So far, the legal battle has produced a 2-inch-thick pad of
legal documents. Yet nowhere in that paperwork is there an
explanation for how the knapsack ended up in the Sussys' backyard.
   ``I don't think we'll ever know unless the person who was dumb
enough to put $10,900 in bills in the knapsack comes forward,''
said lawyer Mark Karney, who represents the Stussys.

   All enterprises are affected by a symbolic general strike called
by the opposition, the latest move in 11-day-old effort to end
one-party Communist rule. Hours earlier, in an apparent effort to
head off the strike, embattled Communist leaders ousted three more
hard-liners from the ruling Politburo. The Communists also endorse
a ``dialogue'' with the opposition and agreed to a parliamentary
inquiry of the brutal police crackdown on a peaceful student rally
Nov. 17.
   The concessions come one day after unprecedented talks between
opposition leaders and Communist premier Ladislav Adamec, who told
about 300,000 demonstrators that authorities were ready to listen

   Another Communist-run daily, the Berliner Zeitung, offered East
Germany's harshest criticism to date of the Czechoslovak party,
saying it was paying ``the bitter price for the grave errors of the

in Prague to refusing political reforms and to ``the illusory,
risky business of trying to choke the call for democracy with

<HEAD>Repatriation of Vietnamese to Begin in February or March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people
from Hong Kong camps will begin by February or March, the Foreign
Office said Monday.
   Foreign Minister Francis Maude would not confirm or deny a
report in the Financial Times of London that the repatriation will
begin by Christmas and that Britain has agreed to pay Vietnam $620
for each person on the first airlift.
   The Financial Times, quoting Vietnamese officials in Hanoi, said
the first repatriations probably would be on a 120-seat Boeing 737
chartered by the Hong Kong government. It said Hong Kong also was
considering chartering larger aircraft or troop carriers, and
passenger liners capable of carrying up to 1,000 passengers.
   The repatriation ``has to start before the sailing season starts
again in February or March,'' Maude said on BBC radio. ``Last year
no fewer than 32,000 people arrived in Hong Kong from Vietnam. We
cannot possibly tolerate that happening again.''
   Britain says most of the 56,000 people sheltered in Hong Kong
have not fled political or religious persecution, but simply are
seeking a better standard of living than that available at home.
   Each is being screened in accordance with standards set down by
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees.
Only 13,000 have been declared genuine refugees.
   Referring to U.S. objections to Britain's plans for forcible
repatriation, Maude said the United States ``has agreed that there
is nowhere for these people to go other than back to Vietnam.''
   Asked whether Britain would be relieved if another country
offered to take 5,000 or 10,000 of the boat people, he replied:
``There would still be 30,000 to 35,000 left. There are no takers
for these people. ... There has been unanimous agreement in the
international community that there is no place for these people to
go other than back to Vietnam.''
   The Foreign Office has said Britain would likely pay
compensation to the boat people it sends back so they can buy tools
and seeds. It has said the sum would be similar to the $600 paid to
boat people who go home voluntarily.
   So far, fewer than 400 people have returned voluntarily to
Vietnam.

   The ruling party said today the
opposition had won the first free vote in four decades, on a
referendum postponing presidential elections to give the fledgling
movement more time to organize and become better known.
   Final results were not expected until Tuesday, but the
presidential candidate of the ruling Socialist Party, formerly the
Communist Party, conceded that voters Sunday approved the
referendum backed by opposition parties.
   ``We can be certain that the number of `yes' votes was higher
than the `no' votes,'' said Imre Pozsgay, the popular Socialist
candidate.
   The results would mean that a new democratic Parliament, to be
chosen by June, will elect the president of the new Hungarian
republic. If voters had rejected the referendum, they would have
elected a president directly on Jan. 7.
   Opposition groups favored postponing the vote until after
parliamentary elections, saying that otherwise they could not
sufficiently organize a serious challenge to Pozsgay. They hope to
win strong representation in the new Parliament, giving their
candidate a better chance at the presidency.
   They also proposed that the president's powers be curtailed.
   With 91.3 percent of the ballots tallied, 50.2 percent favored a
direct election before the parliamentary elections and 49.8 percent
were for postponement until afterward, said Pal Kara, secretary of
the referendum committee in parliament told journalists.
   Kara said the voted yet to be counted could swing the vote the
other way. Final results were not to be made public before Tuesday,
he said.
   The turnout represents 58.2 percent of Hungary's 7.8 million
eligible voters, Kara said _ above the 50 percent needed to make to
vote binding.
   The plebiscite is the first free vote in Hungary since
Communists came to power more than four decades ago.
   It comes just a month after a new republic was declared in a
symbolic rejection of Communist rule and Parliament adopted
legislation opening the way for the free multiparty elections.
   The turnout marked ``an important step'' in the country's drive
for democracy, said Tibor Vidos, the executive director of the
opposition Free Democrats. ``It shows people are interested in
deciding their own future.''
   The ruling Socialist Party _ which replaced the recently
dissolved Communist Party _ and several other opposition groups had
agreed on direct voting for the first president of the republic
before the parliamentary elections.
   However, the League of Free Democrats and three other groups
expressed concern that if Pozsgay won in early presidential
elections, too much power could be concentrated with the ruling
Socialists before a democratic Parliament can been chosen.
   They gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a petition calling
for the referendum.
   The powers of the new presidency include commanding the armed
forces, calling elections and dissolving Parliament.
   Three other questions on the ballot dealt with traditional
aspects of the governing party's power.
   _ Whether the Workers' Militia, created to protect the party,
should be dissolved;
   _ Whether the party should remove its organizational cells from
the workplace;
   _ And whether it should make a public accounting of its assets.
   With the militia in the process of being dissolved, Parliament
voting against continued politization of the businesses and
factories and agreement to open Socialist Party books, voting on
the latter three issues was purely symbolic.

   A U.S. team flew to Vietnam on Monday
for the first technical talks on missing American soldiers since
Vietnam last month agreed to expand cooperation on the issue.
   The team of military specialists was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey,
commander of the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center.
   The center is trying to determine the fate of the 2,323
Americans listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   James Williams, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, said
the three days of talks would be the first since the negotiations
Oct. 29-30 by special U.S. presidential envoy John W. Vessey and
Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach.
   Vessey said the Vietnamese agreed to work on two new lists of
top-priority ``discrepancy cases'' involving about 80 Americans.
Such cases include people whom the United States believed were
taken prisoner but not freed after U.S. involvement in the war
ended in 1973.

   Three of four state social workers charged
with failure to report suspected abuse before the potty-training
death of a toddler would pay only a $100 fine under a deal offered
today by prosecutors, attorneys said.
   The offer by prosecutors would avoid jail sentences for the
three, who were each charged with misdemeanors Aug. 31 in the case
of 2-year-old Bradley McGee.
   The boy died of a brain hemorrhage after his mother and
stepfather punished him for soiling his diapers by dunking him
head-first into a commode, police said.
   An investigation revealed that the child was released to his
parents' custody despite warnings by a foster parent of the
possibility of abuse.
   The plea agreement was offered to Kenneth Houk, a state program
administrator, supervisor Judy Ross and caseworker Shirley DuBoise;
each was charged with failing to report child abuse, a misdemeanor.
   Caseworker Margaret Barber was charged with aggravated child
abuse, a felony charge, in addition to the misdemeanor charge. She
was not offered any deal, attorney said.
   A conviction on the felony could mean a jail sentence of up to
five years; conviction on the misdemeanor could be punished by up
to 60 days in jail.
   Assistant State Attorney John Aguero acknowledged that a plea
agreement was in the works, but would not comment on the details.
   A pre-trial hearing on the case was set for Dec. 28.
   The mother and stepfather of McGee have been charged with
first-degree murder in the July 28 death of the child.
   Earlier this month, the Florida Legislature passed a bill
allocating $39 million to pay for more caseworkers to prevent child
abuse.

<TEXT>
   Opposition presidential candidate
Rafael Leonardo Callejas, a U.S.-trained economist, claimed victory
today in Honduras' third free election this decade. Official
returns were incomplete.
   ``I invite my opponents to join me in reconstructing Honduras,''
Callejas, of the National Party, told a cheering crowd at election
headquarters early this morning.
   In unofficial returns representing about 67 percent of
precincts, Callejas had 595,807 votes, or about 50.2 percent, to
526,110, or about 44.5 percent, for Carlos Flores of the governing
Liberal Party.
   Official returns, much slower in coming out, showed a narrower
lead. After announcing Callejas had 44,538 votes to Flores' 43,383
late Sunday, the electoral tribunal announced that its computer had
crashed and it closed for the night.
   ``We may have to start over,'' said Mario Arnaldo Barrientos, a
member of the tribunal's information committee, in an interview at
the computer center today. He said the problem may have been
related to the large volume of incoming results, but tests were
being run.
   Minor parties took the rest of the vote; only a plurality was
needed to win.
   ``If the present trend continues, Callejas will win,'' said
Liberal Party treasurer Jorge Roberto Maradiaga in a telephone
interview. ``The people will regret this.''
   If Callejas takes office on Jan. 27 for a four-year term, he
will become the first opposition candidate to take power in a
peaceful vote in 57 years.
   The winner faces grim problems in this underdeveloped nation of
about 5 million _ a stagnant economy, an unpayable debt and wars in
two bordering countries, El Salvador and Nicaragua. On Sunday, El
Salvador suspended relations with Nicaragua and accused it of
arming leftist Salvadoran guerrillas.
   ``In this violent Central America, where the youth of our
neighbors is spilling its blood, the people of Honduras have given
a `yes' to peace and a `no' to blood,'' Callejas said in an earlier
victory statement at party headquarters Sunday night.
   Callejas, like Flores, has made it clear that he wants
U.S.-supported Contras fighting Nicaragua's Sandinista government
to leave Honduras, but he also fears Honduras will alone have to
deal with getting rid of the Contra fighters if U.S. aid stops.
   He offered no new ideas for achieving that end during the
campaign. On Sunday he called for Central American presidents to
``reconstruct'' the peace process in the wake of El Salvador's
decision to break with Nicaragua.
   He also said he would be willing to accompany Azcona to any
summit that might take place before Jan. 27.
   Callejas has promised to privatize government-owned companies,
cut government spending and open the nation to foreign investment.
   The International Monetary Fund has suspended loans on Dec. 1
because Honduras has refused to negotiate over payments on old debt.
   Honduras owes $3.2 billion, most of it to international
institutions, and the United States is holding up $70 million in
fiscal aid until Honduras makes an arrangement with those
institutions.
   Callejas, 46, comes from a landowning family and was trained as
an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University.
   He attributed the election's results to ``hard work and the
desire for change'' and pitched his campaign against the government
of President Jose Azcona Hoyo, saying eight years of Liberal
government had only made things worse.
   Also at stake were three vice presidential posts, a 130-seat
unicameral congress and 289 mayoralties. Voting was by party slate,
with no ticket splitting allowed.
   The Nationalists appeared to be gaining a congressional
majority, and National Party candidate Nora Melgar claimed victory
in the capital of Tegucigalpa.
   More than 2.2 million people were registered, but voting was
concentrated at relatively few locations and some people had to
travel long distances.
   Turnout was nevertheless heavy and observers reported few
irregularties.
   ``The problems don't appear to systematically favor one side or
another,'' said an observer for the Organization of American States.
   The last time there was a party-to-party transition came in
1933, when Tiburcio Carias Andino of the National Party took over
from Liberal Vicente Mejia Colindres. Carias didn't allow another
vote until 1948.

<TEXT>
   Existing-home sales last month remained steady
at their highest level since January, a real estate trade group
said Monday, and analysts expect single-digit mortgage rates to
sustain sales well into the new year.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing
single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.52 million, the same as September's revised rate and the highest
since January's 3.55 million rate. The September rate was 1.2
percent above August's 3.48 million sales.
   The Realtors' survey, falling mortgage interest rates and an
earlier government report of a 12 percent increase in new housing
starts in October make ``things look somewhat brighter for the
housing market in the future,'' said economist Rob Rosenblatt of
the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Rosenblatt and the Realtors' chief economist, John A. Tuccillo,
predicted that mortgage rates will remain low into next year, with
Rosenblatt suggesting they could fall as low as 9 percent by early
next spring.
   ``Overall, home financing conditions probably will stay quite
favorable in the months ahead,'' Tuccillo said.
   Rosenblatt also said he expects October's new home sales to post
a sharp rebound from September's 14 percent drop, which analysts
said resulted from a spike in mortgage rates to above 10 percent.
   Fixed-rate mortgages fell steadily from 10.10 percent to 9.82
percent during October, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., and had dropped to 9.74 percent by last Wednesday.
   ``Lower rates are sustaining sales at a healthy clip,'' said
Realtors' President Norman D. Flynn. ``Buyers priced out by higher
rates earlier this year are in the market now.''
   For a year, the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher to
battle inflationary pressures. But, since last spring, the central
bank has been gradually easing its grip on credit, allowing
mortgage rates and a variety of other consumer and business loan
rates to fall.
   The Realtors said the national median price for an existing
single-family home was $92,100, down $2,200 from September. The
median price means that half the homes sold for more, half for less.
   The West posted the only increase in sales in October, up 3.4
percent to an annual rate of 610,000 units, the Realtors said. The
median price for a home in the West was $142,200, $5,400 below the
September cost.
   Sales were unchanged from September's 1.34 million unit rate in
the South, where the median home price was $83,400, down $1,000
from September.
   Sales declined 1 percent in the Midwest to 980,000 and dropped
1.7 percent to 580,000 units in the Northeast. The median price for
a home in the Midwest was $70,900, $1,300 below the September
price, and $143,300 in the Northeast, $2,400 below the September
cost.

<HEAD>Honecker a `Broken Man,' Bodyguard Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erich Honecker is ``a broken man'' since his
ouster as East German leader last month, his bodyguard said Monday.
   ``For him the world has fallen apart,'' said Gen. Guenter Wolf,
speaking to reporters at the secluded Wandlitz residential area
oustide East Berlin.
   Honecker, 77, was ousted Oct. 18 amid a massive exodus of East
Germans heading West and large anti-government demonstrations. He
was replaced by Egon Krenz.
   Wolf, speaking to reporters outside Honecker's house in the
wooded compound, said the former leader was ailing.
   Krenz also has said that Honecker is too ill to be questioned by
a party commission conducting a disciplinary investigation of
Honecker. He underwent two gall bladder operations during the
summer, and his wife has said he still has not recovered fully.
   Reporters caught a glimpse of Honecker on the upper floor of the
house, apparently talking to a visitor and looking through some
papers.
   Wolf said Honecker and his wife, Margot, who lost her post as
education minister shortly her husband's ouster, want to move from
Wandlitz before the end of the year.
   ``But it's not easy to find a suitable apartment for old men and
their families in East Berlin,'' Wolf said. ``Otherwise, this place
would be empty already.''
   The Communist Party elite for years has lived in the walled,
heavily guarded compound. But Krenz moved to a modest house in East
Berlin one week ago and said other leading party officials would
follow.
   Authorities allowed East German journalists to tour Wandlitz for
the first time last week, and on Monday allowed a tour of the
compound by Western reporters.
   Other ousted Politburo members still live in Wandlitz, including
former economy chief Guenter Mittag and former propaganda chief
Kurt Hager.
   Krenz's new leadership has blamed Honecker and Mittag for
plunging the country into the crisis and Mittag has been kicked out
of the party. The investigation of Honecker could result in his
ouster from the party.
   A special parliamentary commission also is investigating charges
of abuse of power by the former leadership.

<TEXT>
   Rebel troops attacked the
presidential palace in the Comoro Republic and killed the longtime
ruler of the Indian Ocean island nation, state-run Radio Comoro
reported today.
   Officials at the Comoro Embassy in Paris said Sunday night's
attack was led by a former army commander who recently resigned in
a dispute with President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane.
   The ex-commandant, Ahmed Mohamed, led an undetermined number of
men in the assassination, said an embassy official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said Mohamed had been arrested and was
in custody.
   The head of the Supreme Court, Mohamed Djohar, will head an
interim government as dictated by the constitution, the official
said. He stressed that it was an assassination, not a coup.
   Life in the capital appeared calm today. Bruce Thompson, manager
of the Galewa Sun hotel, told the South African Press Association
everything was normal.
   Radio Comoro, monitored on the French-administered island of
Mayotte, reported that Abderrahmane, 70, was killed in a firefight
between the rebels and members of his 300-man presidential guard.
One guard was reported killed.
   The presidential guard is better equipped and trained than the
700-man regular forces formerly commanded by Mohamed. It was not
immediately known whether any guard members were involved in the
assassination plot.
   The rebel forces launched their attack in the capital of Moroni,
on the main island of Grand Camore, at about midnight Sunday, the
French news agency Agence France-Presse reported.
   Forty days of mourning were declared. Abderrahmane will be
buried Tuesday on his native island of Anjouan, the radio station
said.
   Three weeks ago, Abderrahmane, who ruled the island for all but
three years since 1972, won a referendum that permitted him to seek
a third six-year term when his current term expired next year.
   Official results showed it passed with 92.5 percent of the vote
but observers complained of ballot-box stuffing, voter harassment
and destroyed ballots.
   Opposition figures in Paris said Abderrahmane had jailed
political leaders who complained he had concentrated too much power
in his own hands.
   Abderrahmane was first elected president of the Comoran
government in 1972, when the archipelago was still a French
possession.
   The Comoros unilaterally declared independence in July 1975 and
Abderrahmane became head of state. He was overthrown a month later
by Ali Soilih, who said Abderrahmane had amassed personal power in
a dictatorial style.
   Abderrahmane returned to power in 1978 with the aid of 50
mercenaries led by Frenchman Bob Denard. He established an Islamic
republic and ran unopposed for re-election in 1984.
   Abderrahmane survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987. His
government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981.
   South African President F.W. De Klerk sent a message of
condolence addressed only to the ``acting head of government''
condemning the ``senseless assassination.''
   De Klerk's foreign minister, Pik Botha, said South Africa's
trade representative in the Comoros reported ``the situation was
under the control of the security forces and that everything was
calm.''
   The Comoros lie between Mozambique and the island nation of
Madagascar. The three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli
cover 718 square miles.
   The island of Mayotte, claimed by the Comoran government,
decided in a 1975 referendum to remain French.
   About a half-million people, mostly Moslem, live in the
republic. It is known for tourism and the export of perfume, copra,
coconuts, cloves, vanilla and cinammon.
   The country, with an estimated annual per capita income of $339,
is among the world's poorest and least developed.

   A 38-year-old British bank robber
surrendered after his getaway car froze to a standstill, newspapers
reported Monday.
   The man, who was not identified, confessed to three bank
robberies in Finland since August and two in Sweden, the media
reported.
   Police found the abandoned British-registered car on the road
outside Helsinki, where temperatures have fallen to 3 degrees below
zero Fahrenheit.
   The man reportedly told police after the breakdown that it was
futile for him to remain a fugitive.
   Photographs of the robber in action were taken by surveillance
cameras in Helsinki banks. Witnesses reported seeing a white car
with the steering wheel on the right side, bringing the vehicle to
the attention of the police.
   The robber has criminal record in Britain, the reports said.

   The White House today applauded the democratic
steps taken by Czechoslovakia and urged the communist country to
follow the path Poland and Hungary are taking toward political and
economic renewal.
   The statement came as millions of Czechs took part in a two-hour
strike to press their demands for political freedoms.
   The country's communist rulers, faced with demonstrations by
hundreds of thousands of Czechs, have purged several members of
their Politburo and promised to lift most censorship. Communist
premier Ladislav Adamec held unprecedented talks Sunday with
opposition leaders.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement:
   ``Over the weekend the public demand for basic freedoms has
spread to another country in Eastern Europe, Czechoslovakia. The
Czechoslovak people have spoken loudly and clearly. They have
firmly expressed their desire for political freedom, including free
elections, free speech and the release of political prisoners.
   ``President Bush commends the Czechoslovak people for both their
courage and for their restraint. Their example is an inspiration to
free peoples everywhere,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater added:
   ``The new regime has spoken of a dialogue with the Czechoslovak
people. The United States hopes that dialogue will commence at an
early date and that Czechoslovakia will follow the path explored by
Poland and Hungary to political and economic renewal.
   ``It is time for this once-proud democracy and strong economy to
be reborn. That opportunity now exists and we hope the leaders of
Czechoslovakia will seize it and move rapidly and peacefully toward
free elections.''

   Romania's exiled king on Monday urged President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss Romania
during their summit meeting and take action to improve conditions
in the country.
   ``I think that they must be able to take some sort of measures
to change the situation'' in Romania during the Dec. 2-3 summit,
said King Michael.
   The king said the principle of non-interference in the internal
affairs of nations does not apply in Romania's case because it is
led by ``a power that exercises state terrorism to muzzle its
people.''
   He accused Romania's hard-line leader Nicolae Ceausescu of
``persisting stubbornly in morally and physically destroying the
Romanians.'' Referring to changes occuring in other East European
countries, Michael said ``it is time that the same happens in
Romania.''
   But, responding to a question, he said he doubted that a popular
uprising was likely soon in Romania because of the government's
repressive nature.
   Michael said he and his family have received death threats
periodically since he went into exile in 1948, and that such
threats have intensified. ``They certainly come from the secret
police,'' he said.
   Michael, who holds a British passport and lives near Geneva, has
said he considers his abdication as not valid because he acted
under coercion from the Soviet-installed government.

   Former Tennessee financiers Jake Butcher
and Earl Wilson entered plea agreements today before the start of
their federal trial on charges that they bilked an Orlando bank of
$3.9 million.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ricardo Pesquera said that the two
defendants and Wilson's wife, Harriette, had pleaded guilty to some
of the charges and declined to elaborate until a mid-afternoon news
conference.
   Butcher and Wilson, who once operated a 20-bank financial
empire, are serving federal sentences for bank fraud in Tennessee
and Kentucky.
   They had pleaded innocent in September to 51 counts of bank
fraud, bribery, conspiracy and misapplication of funds in the 1986
collapse of the Florida Center Bank in Orlando.

   It took two passes in a hydraulic lift, but
first lady Barbara Bush finally got close enough to the top of the
National Christmas Tree to crown it with a white plastic star
Monday.
   Mrs. Bush was joined on the somewhat bumpy journey in the
hydraulic lift to the top of the 35-foot tree by her 3{-year-old
granddaughter, Marshall, and Joseph Riley, president of the
Christmas Pageant of Peace.
   The lift operator left the threesome a few feet short on his
first try.
   Mrs. Bush, who has been topping off the National Christmas Tree
every November since 1981, signalled to him to lift them higher,
and on the second try she and Riley managed to get a silver pole
holding the outsized plastic star in place.
   Marshall, seasonally garbed in a bright red dress with a red
ribbon in her hair, took it all in stride, waving to her mother,
Margaret Bush, and preschool classmates on the ground below.
   When the ride downward was briefly halted, Marshall called out
cheerfully, but insistently, ``Hey, when are we going down? Get me
down here.''
   ``Perfect,'' pronounced Mrs. Bush as the white cage finally
perched on terra firma. She took Marshall over to shake hands and
pose for a picture with the lift operator, National Park Service
tree worker Kevin Guard.
   ``I thought she was coming over to chew me out,'' Guard said
afterward. ``She just said thanks.''
   Guard, 35, was pressed into service when the Park Service found
itself with a rented lift, but no operator.
   ``I was scared to death,'' he said. ``I'm in trees _ trim them,
cut them down, make them safe.''
   Asked how he wound up with the job of hoisting the first lady
and kin up to the top of the living Christmas tree, Guard said:
   ``It just happened. I usually drive a cherry picker. They didn't
have an operator, so I did it.''
   Mrs. Bush has said that topping off the tree was one of her
favorite duties as the vice president's wife, and when Riley asked
her last year if she wanted to keep doing it, she leapt at the
opportunity, becoming the first first lady to do so.
   She called Marilyn Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle,
and Mrs. Quayle told her to go right ahead, aides said.
   The tree, a Colorado Blue Spruce transplanted to the Ellipse
from a farm in York, Pa., in 1978, will be adorned with a 1,000
more white stars _ representing President Bush's ``Thousand Points
of Light'' _ and several thousand red and blue lights over the next
two weeks.
   Bush, keeping up a tradition that President Coolidge started in
1923, will throw the switch to light the national tree at nightfall
on Dec. 14.

<HEAD>City Official's Spending Endorses Topless Bar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A convention recruiter who had hoped public
fervor was quelled when he promised city officials he would no
longer take clients to a posh topless nightclub has learned that
signs of the controversy still exist.
   Jordy Tollett, director of the Houston Civic Center, has found
his explanation has become a giant endorsement for the nightclub.
   Printed in large yellow letters at the bottom of a
40-foot-by-20-foot billboard for Rick's restaurant and bar are
Tollett's words: ``Our clients want to go there!''
   In September, The Houston Post reported Tollett had spent more
than $2,000 entertaining male clients at the club with funds from
the Greater Houston Visitors and Convention Bureau _ 75 percent of
which come from taxes. The Civic Center department, with a $26
million budget, oversees the George R. Brown Convention Center,
among other facilities.
   In his defense, the mayoral appointee said he was wooing
convention business.
   ``Unfortunately, Rick's just happens to be something that's very
well-known,'' Tollett said at the time. ``They (clients) just
wanted to go there. I couldn't say, `You can't go there.' ''
   Tollett was admonished privately by Mayor Kathy Whitmire and
subsequently promised never to take clients there again.
   Since then, Rick's owners have spent $6,000 a month for three
billboards.
   The billboard also features endorsements from Robin Leach of
``Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous'' and ``Penthouse Magazine.''
   But the appearance of Tollett's words has embarrassed him and
angered Mark Henry, the new president of the convention bureau.
   ``I have limited sympathy for their discomfort because I'm very
proud of my business and the city of Houston's better off for it,''
said Robert Watters, an owner of Rick's.
   But there were sore feelings over the matter at Rick's, which
boasts an expensive and sophisticated atmosphere.
   ``It's the same old hypocrisy thing,'' said Watters, who said
the convention bureau solicits its membership each year and
privately acknowledges that conventioneers flock to the cabaret.
But, he said, publicly, bureau officials complain about the club.
   He said at first, the endorsement was attributed to the bureau
itself. But after Henry called several times to complain, Watters
said the sign was changed to reflect Tollett as author of the
statement.

   King Hussein told the new parliament Monday
he will legalize political parties and relax martial law, opening
the way to more freedom in Jordan after the first national
elections in 22 years.
   ``There is no doubt the current national assembly represents a
new phase in our life,'' Hussein said in a speech inaugurating the
legislature.
   He spoke of commitment to freedom of thought and expression in
Jordan, where political parties have been banned for 33 years, and
martial law has been in force for 22, since the Arab-Israeli war of
1967.
   Hussein, dressed in a black ceremonial military uniform, said he
would have a royal commission draft a national charter defining
``the basic central concepts of nationalism and patriotism.''
   ``The emergence and activity of political organizations will be
based on these concepts and definitions,'' he told a joint session
of the 80-member Chamber of Deputies, elected by the people, and
the 40 members of the Senate, appointed by the king.
   Parties were banned in 1957 after a coup attempt by leftists,
but the government permitted them to run candidates in the
elections last month.
   The king said the government would try to strengthen civilian
courts ``to reduce gradually the need for martial and special
courts.''
   Loss of the West Bank to Israel in 1967 made blocked national
elections until Hussein renounced sovereignty over the territory
last year, in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Martial law gives the government sweeping powers, forbids
unlicensed gatherings and restricts legal rights. It has been
applied to a range of matters from murder cases through bank
scandals to allegations of price-gouging by vegetable vendors.
   In their campaigns, most legislative candidates demanded
legalization of parties, an end to martial law and greater press
freedom.
   Islamic fundamentalists, who won the largest bloc of seats, were
divided in the first major action of the new Chamber of Deputies,
splitting their vote for speaker.
   Suleiman Arar, former interior minister and an ally of the king,
defeated a candidate of the conservative Moslem Brotherhood 44-36
with the aid of more- liberal Islamists.
   The government must work with the Islamists to get its
legislation passed, Hussein can block any law he dislikes, either
in the Senate or by veto. He also has the power to dissolve the
legislature and rule without it.
   Conservative Islamists _ the Brotherhood and their allies _
campaigned for more social welfare programs, a crackdown on
corruption, stricter observance of Islamic law and the destruction
of Israel. They seek bans on liquor and the levying of interest,
and greater segregation of sexes.
   Prominent Islamist deputy Yousef Azem said Monday, however, the
fundamentalists hope to ``cooperate with the government for the
interest of the country and its citizens.''
   Hussein repeated his support for the PLO and its steps toward
peace, and declared to the assembly: ``Israel is the side that
continues to thwart progress.''
   About half the 3 million people in Jordan are Palestinians, many
of them refugees displaced by the creation of Israel.
   ``The only solution to the Palestinian problem lies in
recognizing Palestiniian rights on Palestinian national soil,'' the
king told the legislators.
   He reported progress toward overcoming problems caused by its
foreign debt of $8.3 billion, which led in April to four days of
rioting in southern Jordan. Hussein reorganized the government and
moved toward democratic reform after the riots.

   The Supreme Court refused Monday to allow New
York City, and perhaps other communities, to enlist unwilling
developers in the fight against spreading homelessness.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a victory for
developers who said New York City violated their rights by banning
conversion or demolition of hotels that offer a haven for the poor,
elderly and ill.
   The high court acted in more than 200 appeals, but in an unusual
move refused to grant full review in any. So far this term, the
number of such grants is well behind previous terms.
   In other developments, the court:
   _Refused to let public schools cut off educational help to
severely handicapped children even though they may not be able to
benefit from such services. The court rejected an appeal by a New
Hampshire school district ordered to help a profoundly retarded
13-year-old boy.
   _Allowed a woman charged with minor traffic violations to sue
Kentucky law enforcement officials who strip-searched her after her
arrest.
   _Left intact an Overland Park, Kan., ordinance restricting the
ownership and possession of ``pit bull dogs.''
   In the homeless case, the court let stand a ruling that a law

single-room-occupancy, or SRght EST.

   Actress Claudette Colbert says her success at
funny nice-girl roles probably blocked her from saucier parts.
   The 86-year-old star of the 1934 romantic comedy ``It Happened
One Night'' and 61 other pictures told Fame magazine in its
December-January issue that there's ``nothing less interesting than
a goody-goody, and I played a lot of them.''
   ``The difficulty was that they made money on my comedies and
never thought of me as doing the other thing, which I could do. The
best thing to play is a bitch, a bitch with a heart of gold,'' said
Colbert, who lives in Barbados and New York.
   Colbert, who will receive the Kennedy Center Award from
President Bush in a nationally televised program Dec. 3, says she
is surprised she has remained so well known worldwide.
   ``Maybe it's because of my funny-shaped face,'' she said.

   Actor Richard Gere believes all reality is a

   Gere made the point during a discussion of Buddhism, the
religion he embraced 16 years ago, according to the magazine's
winter issue.
   Gere also is an avid supporter of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual
leader of Tibetan Buddhists, and of Tibetan nationalism.
   ``These are a gentle, spiritual people who have been
systematically murdered by the Chinese,'' he said of the Tibetans.
   Chinese soldiers entered Tibet in 1950. The Chinese government
has said it was merely asserting control over a region that
traditionally was part of China, and that the theocracy over which
the Dalai Lama presided kept most Tibetans in poverty.

copyright interview published Monday.
   The Saudi Arabian, once considered the world's richest man, told

   ``I maintain a positive attitude. Life is a game. It's varying

   Khashoggi, 54, posted $10 million bail July 27 so he could live

Marcos defraud the Philippine treasury.
   He insisted he had done nothing wrong, and added: ``I do not

   The Soviet Union formally recognized
Monday the right of Poland to evolve a political system free of
outside interference.
   In a joint declaration at the end of a five-day visit to the
Soviet Union by Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, head of Poland's
non-Communist government, the two nations expressed their concerns
about a reunified Germany.
   The Soviet Union and Poland welcomed the developing democratic
landscape in East Germany but voiced the conviction that the
relationship between the two Germanys must respect the border
between East and West.
   Maintenance of the border has ``an unusually important
significance for the maintenance of stability and security in
Europe,'' the statement said.
   Both the Soviet Union and Poland suffered deeply from Nazi
aggression during World War II and Polish officials have expressed
concern about the potential emergence of a powerful unified Germany
in the heart of Europe.
   Mazowiecki's election Aug. 24 ended more than 40 years of
Communist rule in Poland and has contributed to opening the way for
other East European nations to introduce democratic reforms.
   The moves have the support of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
who says they are necessary for Eastern Europe to catch up to the
West.
   Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity editor and close adviser to Lech
Walesa, exchanged views on the East bloc with Soviet leaders,
concluding that the process of democratization is allowing the
nations the freedom to choose their own form of government.
   Poland and the Soviet Union are to develop ``as before, their
alliance relations on the basis of mutual trust, recognizing the
free choice of the development of the social-political path, full
reciprocity and non-interference in internal affairs,'' it said.
   ``They are determined to develop good-neighborliness and
alliance relations between the two countries on the basis of new
political thinking,'' the document said.
   It formalized the Soviet guarantee that it would not interfere
in the internal affairs of its East European neighbors, even if
they chose to reject communism.
   The primary Polish aim of the visit was to gain public Soviet
acceptance of the new government, many of whose members come from
the Solidarity free trade union movement.
   Apart from developments in Eastern Europe, the visit focused on
economic issues, the question of historical ``blank spots'' _ parts
of history the communist authorities have rewritten or suppressed _
and the situation of the estimated 2 million Soviet citizens of
Polish origin.
   The statement said the Soviet Union was ready to maintain its
supply of oil and raw materials in exchange for delivery of Polish
manufactured goods.
   Both sides agreed to coordinate future development of trade as
Poland converts its centrally planned economy to a market-oriented
system. Trade with the Soviet Union accounts for one-third of
Poland's foreign trade.
   The hopes of many Poles for a clear Kremlin statement on the
massacre of 4,300 Polish officers in the Katyn forest in the Soviet
Union during Wold War II were not met.
   Most Poles and Western historians believe the officers were
murdered by the Soviet secret police in 1940. The Soviet Union says
the Nazis were guilty.
   On Sunday, Mazowiecki made an emotional visit to the forest,
about 250 miles west of Moscow, and took part in a Roman Catholic
Mass in honor of the dead.
   The statement said both countries believe that clarification of
historical issues _ and above all, the Katyn question _ would
strengthen their ties. The two countries also agreed to create
conditions to improve the situation of Poles living in the Soviet
Union.
   The Poles will be guaranteed the right to develop schools to
teach the Polish language, create their own cultural societies and
be able to attend church services.
   Mazowiecki traveled to Leningrad on Monday to meet with
intellectuals in a city with which Poland had close ties before the
1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
   Some of Poland's most prominent poets, lawyers and political
activists of the 19th century studied in St. Petersburg, as the
city was known then, and Mazowiecki's advisers say he is interested
in reviving the ties.
   Mazowiecki was applauded warmly by about 50 intellectuals when
he encouraged them to develop independent political and cultural
initiatives.

   President-elect Luis Lacalle, whose
National Party gained ground in Congress but fell short of a
majority, said Monday he would try to form a coalition government.
   His center-right National Party won 37.4 percent of the votes in
Sunday's general elections, compared with 28.8 percent for the
Colorado Party, which has been in power; 19.7 for the Broad Front;
and smaller totals for five other parties, according to official
count of 90.4 percent of returns.
   The Colorados also are center-right. The Broad Front alliance is
leftist and includes the Socialist Party, Communist Party and
former Tupamaro guerrillas who tried to overthrow a Colorado
government in the late 1960s.
   Lacalle's party was was projected to win 12 of the 30 Senate
seats and 38 places in the House of Deputies, which has 99 members.
   He said meetings will be held this week to build ``a governing
coalition, which we ... consider indispensible for the correct
functioning of the government.''
   Taking a customary morning stroll beside a beach near his home,
the president-elect said: ``I'm aware the task that awaits me is
very difficult ... but I always knew that.''
   President Julio M. Sanguinetti of the Colorados and Jorge
Batlle, the party's unsuccessful presidential candidate, indicated
support for a coalition.
   Sanguinetti, who was barred by law from seeking another term and
remains in office until March 1, said he did not ``see any
particular inconvenience'' in opening the coalition to the Broad
Front.
   Liber Seregni, the Front's presidential candidate, told Lacalle
his party ``is disposed to talk ... in the search for solutions our
country needs.''
   Uruguay, a small South American republic between Argentina and
Brazil, suffers from chronic inflation and economic stagnation.
   A modest recovery occurred during Sanguinetti's five-year term,
but wages and pensions remain low, the cost of living has risen 82
percent this year and the gross national product of $8 billion
improved by only about 1 percent.
   Public services in Uruguay were a model for the continent in the
1950s. Now schools and hospitals are deteriorating, and electricity
and gas are so expensive many people must use them sparingly.
   Lacalle, a 48-year-old senator, pledged in his campaign to
curtail inflation by negotiating a reduction of Uruguay's $6.3
billion foreign debt, thus freeing more public funds for other
uses. He proposes to sell some of the 3 million ounces of gold
reserves and invest the money to earn interest.
   Areas in which talks with the Broad Front may founder are the
foreign debt and Lacalle's plans for deregulation and getting the
government out of an economy it has directed for decades.
   Labor and leftist political parties oppose paying the debt, and
fear selling state enterprises over to private owners may result in
pay cuts and the loss of jobs.
   ``We say we don't have to pay one cent'' of the foreign debt,
said Julio Marenales, a founder of the Tupamaros. ``That money
should be invested in the country.''

<TEXT>
   A reduction in U.S. troops in Western Europe
is an option President Bush will bring to his meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a White House spokesman said today.
   But press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
does not want to ``get the cart in front of the horse'' in
discussing any such reductions prematurely, and before consulting
with NATO allies.
   ``Any actions that we would suggest or recommend would only be
with the appoval of our allies,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said Bush also will raise with Gorbachev at the Dec.
2-3 shipboard summit the issue of continued shipments of
Soviet-bloc arms to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   He noted that among weapons found over the weekend in the debris
of a crashed Nicaraguan aircraft destined for a Salvadoran rebel
base ``were Soviet-made SA-7 missiles.''
   Bush ``will tell President Gorbachev that the introduction of
surface-to-air weapons in a guerrilla war in El Salvador is a
dangerous escalation of a conflict, contrary to high-level Soviet
assurances,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Despite Soviet promises to use their influence for peace in
Central America, it is clear the Sandinistas and their Marxist
allies continue to destabilize the legitimate democracies of the
region,'' Fitzwater said.
   Conventional force reduction in Europe will remain the subject
for ongoing international negotiations, Fitzwater said.
   Noting the nation's tight budget posture, he said, ``if there
are arms control agreements or changes in military posture...that
allow us to make defense spending cuts, we certainly are willing to
do that.''
   Responding to reports that the upheaval in Eastern Europe could
lead to major cuts in U.S. defense spending, Fitzwater said:
   ``Certainly the two presidents in Malta will talk about arms
control and military force structure. Those discussions will bear
on future decisions about changes in our own military posture.''
   Asked whether Bush planned to bring troop cuts to the table at
Malta, Fitzwater said: ``The president will have in his mind all of
the options that are available to him. The president wants to be in
a postion to discuss the situation with the Soviet leader, to be
responsive and to be in a positon to then go to our allies and say,
here's what our discussion produced.''
   ``As the president considers the budget, as he considers all of
the options that might be available to us as a result of the
reduction of Soviet force strength, there are all kinds of numbers
floating around,'' Fitzwater added.
   The events in Eastern Europe are expected to dominate next
weekend's superpower summit, although Bush and Gorbachev also will
be discussing arms control, trade and regional conflicts from
Nicaragua to Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Friends of British journalist John McCarthy, who
is held hostage in Lebanon, marked his 33rd birthday Monday with a
demonstration at the Foreign Office, demanding it do more for his
release.
   They signed a giant card to celebrate his birthday _ his fourth
in captivity _ released white doves and took out an ad in a Beirut
newspaper to appeal for him to be allowed to contact his family.
   ``A dove is a symbol of peace,'' said Jill Morrell, a close
friend of McCarthy. ``We are releasing them as a gesture of freedom
in the hope of galvanizing the Foreign Office to do more.''
   McCarthy, a Worldwide Television News journalist, was kidnapped
April 17, 1986, as he drove to Beirut airport to fly home after 32
days in Lebanon.
   It happened two days after the bombing raid on Libya by U.S.
warplanes based in Britain.
   No group has claimed responsibility for McCarthy's abduction and
only in April 1988 did word emerge from released French hostages
that he was alive. No communication has been received from him, and
his captors have released no photos or videotapes.
   McCarthy is among 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon and believed
held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems. Held longest is American Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Other missing Britons are Terry Waite, the Anglican Church envoy
who went to Beirut to try to free the hostages; Brian Keenan, a
teacher holding British and Irish citizenship; Alec Collett, a New
York-based British journalist whose kidnappers say they killed him;
and Jack Mann, a retired airline pilot.
   The Friends of John McCarthy, Ms. Morrell's organization,
published a full-page paid ad in Beirut's leftist newspaper
As-Safir.
   ``To the people who are holding our friend John McCarthy, we
appeal to you to allow him contact with his family, through
whatever means you choose,'' it said.
   Ms. Morrell said she wants evidence the Foreign Office is
working for the hostages.
   ``For 3{ years we have had nothing but words,'' she said. ``When
someone important like Terry Waite is among the hostages you would
imagine the government moving heaven and earth to get them out.
   ``But that hasn't happened. They have just one person keeping an
eye on the hostage situation. The government is just standing by
and letting it happen. Britain is tolerating what is happening to
John and the other hostages,'' Ms. Morrell said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said several Foreign Office officials
are following up every lead.
   ``As Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said only one week ago, we
continue to make every effort to secure his release and the release
of the other hostages,'' said the spokesman. He added that Hurd
would meet with Ms. Morrell as soon as his schedule allowed,
probably after the New Year holiday.
   The Friends of John McCarthy was formed six months after he
disappeared, and Ms. Morrell, also a TV journalist, has been waging
a campaign on McCarthy's behalf.
   It includes fund-raising, demonstrations and 150 billboards
around London that say: ``Close your eyes and think of England.
John McCarthy has been doing nothing else for three years.''
   The billboards and a TV commercial were produced for free by the
advertising agency Bartle, Bogle, Hegarty.
   ``There's a very strong feeling by people in the media to use
whatever talents they have to help and this is what we can do
best,'' said Stef Tiratelli, the executive responsible for the ad
campaign.
   ``Inch by inch we have made progress,'' said Robin Corbett, an
opposition Labor Party lawmaker involved with the campaign. ``Two
years ago the government insisted there was no link with Iran and
the hostages and that has changed.''
   Ms. Morrell said she is sure she'll see McCarthy again.
   ``Other people have been released after a long time and they're
OK,'' she said. ``They're in bad shape but they're OK, which gives
me hope.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's main
anti-apartheid alliance Monday called for an internationally
supervised inquiry into allegations a police death squad
assassinated government opponents.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of opposition groups,
said the inquiry should examine the possible complicity of
top-ranking government officials, including Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok and President F.W. de Klerk.
   The movement also demanded the dismantling of the security
branch of the national police force.
   Without such steps, the movement said, ``a few individuals will
be made scapegoats, while the biggest criminals _ those in command
_ will be able to continue `business as usual.'''
   The movement said the International Commission of Jurists should
send prominent judges from overseas to participate in an inquiry of
the allegations, based on recent claims by three former police
officers that they were involved in a death squad.
   Dirk Coetzee, a white former police captain, told the
anti-apartheid newspaper Free Weekly he commanded a squad of black
constables that carried out assassinations in the early 1980s.
   His statements meshed in many respects with those of two black
former officers: David Tshikalange, who like Coetzee has fled South
Africa, and Butana Nofomela, who is on Death Row and received a
stay of execution after making his allegations in an affidavit
obtained by human rights lawyers.
   Lt. Gen. Lothar Neethling, one of the police officials
implicated by Coetzee, on Monday demanded a printed apology and
$200,000 in damages from Free Weekly, saying the newspaper had
defamed him and placed his life in danger. The newspaper quoted
Coetzee as saying Neethling, commander of the police forensic
laboratories, had concocted a poison for use in political
assassinations.
   De Klerk, in interviews published over the weekend by The
Washington Post and Newsweek magazine, said the charges would be
``investigated right to the core, to ensure that all the facts come
to the table.''
   ``I will not stand for this sort of thing,'' he said. ``If the
allegations prove to be true, there will be action.''
   However, the Mass Democratic Movement said the entire
government, including de Klerk, must be forced to account for the
allegedly broad scope of death squad activity.
   ``Recent circumstantial evidence tends to confirm our belief
that there has been government complicity at every level in the
operation of these death squads,'' the movement said.
``Wide-ranging and drastic action is needed to put an end to these
apartheid crimes.''
   There have been widespread calls for the appointment of a
judicial commission to investigate the allegations, but the Mass
Democratic Movement said the participation of overseas judges and
South African human rights lawyers would be needed to ensure that
government-appointed South African judges on the commission pursued
their task effectively.
   The movement demanded the government compensate the families of
activists allegedly killed by death squads. It also said South
African diplomats should be expelled from countries where South
Afican security officials were suspected of having carried out
``international terrorism.''

<HEAD>Aoun Rejects Ultimatum to Leave Presidential Palace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAABDA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
rejected an ultimatum to leave the presidential palace, and said
Monday he would die fighting, even with ``kitchen knives, sticks
and stones.''
   Aoun told a news conference in his bunker beneath the
shell-battered palace east of Beirut that he was recruiting
volunteers to meet a possible assault by the 40,000 Syrian soldiers
stationed in Lebanon.
   Military sources discounted reports of military buildups in
mountains above the palace in the Baabda suburb, and along the line
that divides Moslem west Beirut from the Christian eastern sector.
   A ranking Moslem army officer said privately: ``There is
absolutely no move on the ground to suggest that a collision is
imminent.''
   He said the ``fronts are as they have been since the
cease-fire'' that began Sept. 22, ending six months of fighting
between the Syrians and the 20,000 men of Aoun's Christian army
units.
   Elias Hrawi, the newly elected president who gave Aoun the
ultimatum, issued a statement at his temporary headquarers in the
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley town of Chtoura urging Christian
troops to support him.
   ``Gen. Aoun is placing the Lebanese nation at an impossible,
destructive and reckless option that leads only to the underground
shelters ... while the presidency has decided to lead the nation
out of the death mill to peace,'' said Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic
like Aoun.
   ``It is the legitimate government's right to employ all means
and potenial to recover what has been usurped from it.''
   On Sunday, the president gave Aoun 48 hours to leave the palace.
   In his bunker, the 54-year-old general said sarcastically Monday
that Hrawi should have been ``considerate enough to make it 72
hours, to give me enough time to pack and leave.''
   ``Mr. Hrawi has no forces of his own to fight me with,'' Aoun
said. ``He will have to rely on Syria's occupation forces.''
   Aoun calls the Syrian soldiers an occupation army and has
declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive them out. The Syrians are
in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate issued in
1976, one year after the beginning of a sectarian civil war that
has taken more than 150,000 lives.
   The Syrians ``have the means to attack me from the air,'' Aoun
said. ``I might be killed in such an air attack. I am going to die
fighting. I'll fight even with kitchen knives, sticks and stones to
defend Lebanon's honor.''
   He said he had opened recruitment centers ``all over the free
(Christian) areas to take volunteers to share in the final battle
for the defense of Lebanon,'' he said, and accused Syria of wanting
to ``eliminate Lebanon.''
   Simon Bitar, 22, said outside the palace he had volunteered,
along with at least 8,000 other young Christians. That number could
not be confirmed.
   After President Amin Gemayel's six-year term ended in September
1988 with Parliament unable to agree on a successor, Aoun led a
Christian Cabinet in competition with a Moslem government for 14
months.
   He rejected Hrawi's election Friday as unconstitutional, as he
had the election of President Rene Mouawad, who was killed
Wednesday, 17 days after he was sworn in.
   By unwritten covenant followed since independence from France in
1943, Lebanon's president is a Maronite, the prime minister a Sunni
Moslem and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   Aoun has denied Syrian charges that he was behind the attack on
Mouawad. On Monday, he repeated his own accusation that the Syrians
killed Mouawad, who was their staunch ally.
   The general also opposed Parliament's approval of a peace plan _
worked out by the legislators in weeks of negotiations at Taif,
Saudi Arabia _ that is designed to give Moslems an equal share of
power.
   Christians were the majority in 1943 and have dominated the
government, army and judiciary since, but Moslems now make up about
55 percent of the population.
   Reporters who went to the bunker saw an anti-aircraft battery at
the palace entrance and soldiers pouring mud, as camouflage, on an
armored personnel carrier and a tank.
   Western journalists who toured Souk el-Gharb and Dhour
el-Shweir, the main gateways to Baabda from Syrian-controlled east
Lebanon, said they did not see Syrian reinforcements.
   Hrawi, 64, said Sunday he was determined to govern from the
palace, the traditional seat of presidents.
   ``Whatever is left of Baabda, even if it is one room, when this
situation is over it will be my residence,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The State Department said today it lodged a
strong protest with the Soviet Embassy concerning the ``dangerous
escalation'' created by Nicaragua's alleged attempt to ship
Soviet-bloc weaponry to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Central
American issue, as a result of the abortive weapons delivery
attempt, will become a prime area of discussion when President Bush
meets with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Dec. 2-3 in the
Mediterranean off Malta.
   The protest note deplores the ``dangerous escalation of
conflict, contrary to Soviet assurances,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She added that Bush will press the Soviets ``to take action to
ensure their allies (Nicaragua and Cuba) cease this outrageous
behavior.''
   The note was delivered the Soviet charge d'affaires at 7 p.m.
Saturday by Robert Kimmitt, the undersecretary of state for
political affairs, and Bernard Aronson, the assistant secretary for
inter-American affairs.
   Delivery of the note on a Saturday evening reflected the concern
with which the United States views the weapons shipment, Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   The note was sent just hours after Salvadoran military
authorities said they discovered two light planes in El Salvador
that were delivering shoulder-fired missiles to the leftist rebels.

<HEAD>Turtle Or Egg? Appeal Should Answer Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When does a sea turtle egg become a
turtle? That twist on the old chicken-egg debate is at the heart of
an appeal by a man convicted of poaching more than 1,000 sea turtle
eggs.
   Some species of sea turtles are endangered, so state law treats
offenses against turtle life harshly.
   James A. Bivens was found guilty in March, sentenced to 60 days
in jail and fined $500, plus $100 for each egg taken from the beach
at John D. MacArthur Beach State Park on Singer Island, for a total
fine of $109,300.
   Bivens' appeal claims the fine is illegal because state law
allows a judge to levy a $100 fine ``per unit of marine life.''
   ``An egg, according to the facts of nature that an egg becomes a
life when it is hatched ... is not a turtle,'' Bivens' lawyer wrote
in court briefs. ``Hence the universal question: Which came first,
the chicken or the egg?''
   Oral arguments on the appeal are set for Jan. 18.
   Prosecutors and wildlife officials say the argument is a new one
to them, but ridiculous nevertheless.
   ``If you kill an egg, it's not going to become a turtle,
obviously,'' said Barbara Schroeder, sea turtle recovery
coordinator for the state Department of Natural Resources.
   But Bivens thinks the laws concerning turtles are too vague.
   ``Just as a chicken is not an egg (and when one eats eggs for
breakfast, one is not eating chicken), a marine turtle is not a
turtle until it comes out of its egg,'' Assistant Public Defender
Louis Carres wrote on Bivens' behalf.
   ``Most of (the eggs) don't even turn into turtles,'' said the
public defender, although he did not know what percentage of sea
turtle eggs usually hatch.
   Carres did not defend his client's motive, saying he was
``probably up to no good'' when caught with the eggs and should
have been fined $500 for having them.

   The Bush administration threatened today to
suspend all U.S. financial support for the United Nations if the
General Assembly upgraded the status of Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler also condemned
as ``objectionable'' a resolution under consideration in the U.N.
Food and Agricultural Organization to channel food assistance to
Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza through the PLO.
   ``We strongly support humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian
people,'' she said, noting that the American contribution this year
is $63 million.
   ``The PLO should not be a conduit for international assistance
to the Palestinians,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``The United States continues to believe that raising this type
of political issue in a meeting of a technical U.N. body is wholly
inappropriate. It does nothing to contribute to the settlement of
the political issue involved, and does substantial harm to the
FAO's credibility as an organization worthy of U.S. support.''
   The PLO has observer status as an organization. The move afoot
would elevate the PLO to observer status as a state in the General
Assembly.
   ``The United States opposes any enhancement in the U.N. of the
status of the self-proclaimed state of Palestine,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   She said the United States was making it clear in notes to
various governments and to officials at the United Nations that
``any action to change the PLO status will have the most serious
adverse consequences.''
   Asked if U.S. support would be withdrawn, the spokeswoman said
``we feel so strongly about this we would cut off funds.''

   Three avowed revolutionaries were
cleared this morning of trying to overthrow the government but the
jury was still considering racketeering complaints.
   After 18 days of deliberations, the jury was allowed to return
its partial verdict after it told District Judge William Young it
was unable to decide whether two of the defendants were guilty of
racketeering.
   The jury also said it couldn't decide whether the two and the
third defendant, Patricia Levasseur, were guilty of racketeering
conspiracy for their roles in a series of bombings and robberies
that began in 1976.
   The government had contended the incidents were part of a plot
to overthrow the government of the United States and as such
constituted seditious conspiracy, a charge rarely used since the
Civil War.
   The judge had urged the jury to try and reach agreement on the
remaining racketeering charges but the jury responded that it was
quitting for the day and would resume deliberations Tuesday.
   Prosecutors allege Raymond Levasseur, his wife, Patricia, and
Richard Williams were members of a terrorist band that robbed banks
and bombed buildings along the East Coast from the mid-1970s to
1984.
   The trial began in January and jurors got the case Nov. 6,
working through many weekends. The jury took just one day off for
the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Defense attorneys have argued that the charges are vague and
that there were other groups operating at the time the defendants
are alleged to have plotted against the government.
   Jurors have asked to review some physical evidence in the case,
including footprint charts and testimony from a currency analyst in
connection with one of the alleged bank robberies. They also have
asked for help in defining a seditious enterprise.
   Lawyers are reluctant to speculate what was happening in the
jury room, or how long a verdict on the other charges might take.
Some legal observers have said the lengthy deliberations are to be
expected, considering that the trial has taken 11 months and
included testimony from about 200 witnesses.
   When the trial began, the defendants described themselves as
``North American anti-imperialists who believe armed resistance is
one of the necessary responses to apartheid, racism, sexism, the
massacres of Native Peoples and capitalist-backed wars.''
   There were seven defendants at the time of the initial jury
selection in March 1988. Prosecutors dropped charges against Thomas
Manning and Jaan Karl Laaman, already serving lengthy sentences on
other charges. Manning's wife, Carol Manning, pleaded guilty to
sedition and other charges, and a separate trial was ordered for
Laaman's wife, Barbara Curzi-Laaman.

   The time travel saga ``Back to the Future Part
II'' hit warp speed in a record Thanksgiving holiday weekend,
gobbling up nearly $40 million at the box office to eclipse
previous champ ``Rocky IV.''
   According to estimates released today, total movie house
revenues for the fall period hit an all-time record of $832
million, up 24 percent from last year.
   ``Back to the Future Part II'' had the biggest non-summer
weekend ever. ``Rocky IV'' punched up $32 million over the same
holiday period in 1985.
   Leading the five-day holiday box office, according to Exhibitor
Relations Co., were Eddie Murphy's ``Harlem Nights'' (estimated
$15.3 million), ``Look Who's Talking'' ($10.8 million), ``The
Little Mermaid'' ($9.9 million) and ``Steel Magnolias'' ($9.4
million).
   ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' was estimated to have revenues of $6
million, ``Prancer'' had $4.6 million, ``Dad'' claimed $3.9
million, ``The Bear'' earned $3.1 million and ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors'' had ticket sales of $2 million.
   Last Wednesday, ``Back to the Future Part II,'' starring Michael
J. Fox, opened to $7 million in what Universal Pictures called the
biggest ever Wednesday box-office gross.
   The previous box office champ on an opening Wednesday was
``Rocky IV'' with a $5.7 million turnstile take.
   ``Back to the Future'' also opened over a five-day holiday
period _ the extended Fourth of July weekend in 1985 _ and its
five-day opening gross was $14.9 million. The film ended up doing
$350 million worldwide.

   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``There are indications of her involvement, that's for certain.''
However, he offered no specifics other than to cite press accounts
of ``her role and her past history there.''
   ``It's fairly clear that these weapons were found there. I mean,
we're not talking about a small package of pistols here. We're
talking about tons of equipment and mortars and dynamite and rounds
of ammunitions and explosives. This is hardly a case of someone

``There's not much question that the material was there. ... I
don't know about her role.''

<HEAD>Two Men Charged in Slaying of 3-Year-Old</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOBILE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gunfight between relatives of two women
feuding over boyfriends claimed a young victim _ a 3-year-old boy
in a parked car whose mother tried to shield him from the gunfire.
   Two men were charged Monday with murder, police spokesman Tom
Jennings said.
   Leonard Ray Williams Jr. was fatally wounded Sunday when the two
groups fought on a street in a north Mobile neighborhood, Jennings
said.
   The slain boy's mother, Sylvia Rivers, 28, had stopped her car
at a relative's home where they planned to have lunch. When she
heard the gunfire, she reached for the boy, who was seated in the
front of the car, but a bullet shattered the windshield and killed
him, Jennings said.
   Mrs. Rivers, who was not involved in the feuding, was treated
for shock at a hospital.
   The slaying followed a bar fight Saturday night between the two
women; the feud had been simmering for three weeks, police said.
   Jerry Harrison, 40, was charged with murder Sunday when he came
to the police station to ask about the incident, Jennings said.
Witnesses had identified Harrison as one of three men in a pickup
truck involved in the shooting.
   Michael Anthony Simmons, 26, also was charged with murder when
he surrendered to police Monday morning.

   The Berlin Wall that for years was a
symbol of communism is rapidly entering the capitalist marketplace
as entrepeneurs hawk chunks of it as the perfect Christmas gift.
   Impromptu businesses around the country are shipping the rubble
of demolished sections of the wall to the United States and selling
pieces in stores, by telephone, by mail order and on the street.
   ``One of our retailers says the two hottest items this Christmas
will be pieces of the Berlin Wall and the dancing flowers,'' said
Richard A. Dale, vice president of sales and marketing for Hyman
Creative Products in this Detroit suburb.
   ``The dancing flower is just a joke, but this is not to be taken
as a joke. We offer this because it has commemorative value for all
time,'' Dale said.
   ``There are some very real feelings associated with it. It
stands for oppression and hardship and we try to respect that,''
said Bob Schnur, Hyman vice president of finance.
   Hyman will package two-ounce pieces of concrete from the 22
sections of the Berlin Wall that have been knocked down since East
Germany opened the barrier between East Berlin and West Berlin. The
chunks, for sale through department store chains, come in boxes
with certificates of authenticity.
   Service Merchandise stores and the St. Louis-based May
Department Store Co. have commitments to sell wall chunks, Dale
said. Hyman also is talking to K mart Corp. Bloomingdales' main New
York City store has taken 200 rocks to test demand, buyer Jack
Gandolfo said.
   The chunks are expected to sell for $10.
   Schnur said his company has the most abundant supply of wall
rubble _ 35 tons _ and plans on shipping in up to an additional 15
tons.
   Other wall-dealing ventures include B&amp;P Imports, a company
formed by a house painter and a car salesman in Munster, Ind.
   B&amp;P has been taking about 300 requests a day by phone and by
mail. Co-owner Paul Wells said his company has sold about 500
pounds of concrete already.
   Authenticating the chunks is costly, and B&amp;P partner William
Bell acknowledged that someone could fraudulently sell ordinary
concrete chunks as pieces of the wall.
   ``Actually if somebody wanted to do it, they probably could.
It's just a matter of morals,'' Bell said. ``We have three pieces
of paper with ours _ a U.S. Customs declaration, an affidavit of
authenticity and the shipping papers. People are real willing to
believe us, they just want some measure of proof.''
   Jameson Broadcast Inc., which produces and sells radio
programming, sent 5,000 nugget-size pieces to nearly 100 stations
in all 50 states as well as stations in Dublin, Ireland and New
Zealand.
   WLLZ-FM, a Jameson client in the Detroit area, gave 25 chunks to
listeners who sent requests by facsimile machine saying why they
wanted the pieces, and 25 to callers.
   One listener, a former U.S. soldier who served at the wall,
wanted ``a piece of the miracle _ something he thought he'd never
see.''
   The distributors say most people want a piece of the wall for
the historic value.
   ``I'm 36 and anyone who spent part of their childhood in the
early '60s will be able to relate to the idea of the Berlin wall
and what it stood for,'' Schnur said. ``Khrushchev said he would
bury the U.S., Kennedy made his speech in Berlin, there were
air-raid drills, bomb shelters... the wall coming down signals an
end to that era.''
   Dale appeared on a radio show recently and said one listener
called the station and asked how to get a chunk of the wall. ``The
person said one of their relatives died trying to get across the
wall,'' he said.
   The companies wouldn't disclose their costs; some haven't seen
the bills yet for shipping the rubble from Berlin. Wells said
shipping runs about $4 a pound.
   And they won't reveal the contacts that enabled them to acquire
parts of the wall.
   ``My partner had to have a lot of contacts for this to happen,''
Dale said. ``But it's still going on right now and I wouldn't want
to jeopardize our returns.''
   B&amp;P admitted: ``We get it from a friend there. Actually, it's
vandalism.''

   Despite the easing of East-West
tensions, European defense ministers Monday urged the United States
to remain strongly committed to the defense of their continent.
   The ministers, representing European members of the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, welcomed the rapid changes in
Eastern Europe but cautioned the allies should keep up their guard.
   ``We ... need to be careful,'' said Spanish Defense Minister
Narcis Serra, who is president of the Eurogroup, made up of a dozen
European nations in NATO.
   The statement comes amid reports the United States is planning
sharp cuts in the Pentagon's budget. The reports have raised
concern about the United States' future ties to Europe.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney arrived in Brussels from the
Netherlands for Tuesday's start of a two-day meeting of alliance
defense ministers at NATO headquarters.
   Serra said the European defense chiefs put off until Tuesday
discussions of possible U.S. defense cuts, wanting to hear
first-hand from Cheney.
   In the Netherlands, Cheney promised that no U.S. troops would be
pulled out of Europe without an East-West agreement on reducing
conventional, or non-nuclear, arms, the Dutch government said.
   Dutch Defense Minister Relus ter Beek quoted Cheney as saying he
expected the conventional arms talks in Vienna to be followed by
another round of disarmament negotiations between NATO and the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``Withdrawal of ... American troops from the European continent
will take place (only) after a (conventional arms) agreement,'' ter
Beek said after meeting with Cheney.
   According to the Dutch official, Cheney said the Pentagon's
budget-cutting work would not affect the Western alliance before a
conventional arms pact was reached. The Defense Department is
drawing up plans to cut planned increases in U.S. military spending
by $180 billion in the 1992-94 budget years.
   The United States has 340,000 troops based in Western Europe,
most of them in West Germany.
   Cheney was quoted in U.S. newspapers as saying that more cuts in
American forces in Europe than now under consideration may be
possible because of the ``erosion'' of the Soviet military threat.
   The stunning political reforms in Eastern Europe have prompted
talk of a reduced _ or different _ role for the military alliances
in the future.
   But the European defense ministers cautioned that ``periods of
rapid change and transformation may ... carry risks of their own.''
   Even after promised arms reductions by the Soviet Union and its
allies, the Warsaw Pact still will ``retain military forces which
substantially outnumber those of the alliance in Europe,'' the
ministers said.
   The presence of U.S. nuclear and conventional forces in Europe
``remains vital to the security of Europe, just as Europe's
security is vital to that of North America,'' the ministers said.
``We therefore reaffirm the high priority that we attach to the
continuing U.S. commitment to the defense of Europe.''
   They called for a successful conclusion of the conventional arms
talks. ``We need a prompt agreement at Vienna,'' Serra said.
   NATO officials expect an accord to be completed next year.
   Such an agreement would lead to hefty cuts in tanks, armored
troop carriers and artillery pieces in an area spanning the
Atlantic to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union. President Bush
in May urged big reductions in U.S. and Soviet troops stationed in
Europe by 1993.
   The European officials also said there have been improvements in
some contributions to NATO. The subject has been a sore point in
the alliance. Critics in the United States complain that some
European members don't do enough for the Western defense while
Washington does too much.
   But the Europeans said Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain and
Britain have increased planned defense spending, and that Spain for
the first time agreed to contribute to NATO's military budget.
   NATO defense ministers meet twice a year in their role as the
Defense Planning Committee. France, which is outside NATO's
military structure, does not attend. Iceland, which has no armed
forces, has observer status.

<HEAD>Jet With 107 Aboard Crashes Outside Bogota; All Reported Dead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Colombian jet with 107 people aboard
crashed in flames today outside Bogota, and officials said all on
board were killed. A caller to a radio station claimed drug
traffickers bombed the jet.
   Witnesses reported seeing the Avianca Airlines Boeing 727-100
explode before it plummeted to the ground at about 7:15 a.m.
   Hours later, a person called the Caracol radio network and said
The Extraditables, a shadowy group linked to the Medellin drug
cartel, bombed the plane because police informants were on board.
   The caller did not identify himself, and there was no way to
authenticate the claim.
   The airline refused comments on reports the plane exploded. Col.
Edgar Leal, chief of national police in the state, said
investigators had not found anything to indicate a bomb blew it up.
   Avianca spokeswoman Patricia Duarte said the plane crashed into
a hilly area just south of Bogota, the capital. She said all 101
passengers and six crew members were killed.
   RCN radio quoted officials at the control tower at El Dorado
Airport in Bogota as saying the jet crashed three minutes after
taking off for the city of Cali, 190 miles to the southwest.
   It quoted the flight controller as saying the pilot reported
everything normal seconds before communication with the plane was
lost.
   ``The plane exploded in the air and then fell to the ground and
caused a huge explosion,'' said Jairo Alba, who witnessed the
crash. Alba, interviewed by the RCN radio network, said the jet was
destroyed.
   Radio stations quoted other witnesses as saying they saw smoke
pouring from one of the three engines and then seeing the plane
blow up.
   ``The plane was flying along when suddenly it exploded, broke in
two and fell in flames and smoke,'' witness Alfonso Moreno told
Radio Caracol.
   ``I heard explosions and I thought there was some problem with
transformers in the electrical station, but I looked up and saw a
plane explode in the air, and bodies and pieces of luggage were
falling,'' another witness Mario Vasquez, said.
   The chief of the Civil Aviation Authority, Col. Jorge Gonzalez,
said the crew of a Colombian air force jet flying in the area saw
two explosions on the jet. He spoke to the radio networks RCN and
Caracol.
   No one on the ground appeared to have been hurt, Gonzalez said.
   Caracol said Flight 203 just cleared the southern edge of this
city of 6 million when it crashed. Witnesses said wreckage was
scattered for miles.
   The nationalities of those on board were not immediately known.
   Boeing Co. spokesman Tom Cole in Seattle said the company would
send investigators to Bogota to help determine the cause of the
crash.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco declared war on drug
traffickers in August, and since then there have been several
bombings and other attacks, but none on a large scale.
   The person who claimed responsibility on behalf of the
Extraditables said six informants on the plane were targeted
because they gave police information that led to the discovery of
the hiding place of the head of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   The Extraditables take their name from the U.S. Justice
Department's list of 12 Colombian drug suspects most wanted in the
United States. The head of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar, tops
the list.
   Last week, authorities raided a jungle hideout, and Escobar
reportedly came close to capture.
   The last major passenger jet crash in Colombia occurred March
17, 1988, when an Avianca Boeing 727-100 crashed into a mountain
near the northern city of Zulia, killing 138 people.
   On July 27, 1985, an air force transport plane crashed in the
Amazon jungle, killing all 74 people aboard. The military plane was
carrying passengers because of a airline strike.

   It's a girl for actor Dan Aykroyd and his
actress-wife Donna Dixon.
   Danielle Alexandra weighed 8 pounds, 13 ounces when she took her
first breath of air on Nov. 18 at 12:05 p.m., said Susan Patricola,
publicist for the couple.
   The couple wanted to get the baby out of St. John's Hospital and

   ``They're thrilled with their new arrival. She's healthy and
beautiful and they're looking forward to parenthood,'' Patricola
said.
   Aykroyd, who rose from the original cast of the ``Saturday Night

movie ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Miss Dixon was on the old ``Bosom Buddies'' TV series.

<HEAD>13 Killed in Natal Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen blacks, including
three policemen, have been killed in the latest outbreak of
factional fighting and political unrest in Natal province, police
said Monday.
   Six policemen have been killed in the province in the past week.
   Police have not said whether the attacks on the policemen were
connected, and the report of other killings Sunday gave few
details. Feuding among political groups, rural clans, and criminal
gangs have claimed more than 3,000 lives in the Zulu areas of Natal
in the past three years.
   Most of the fighting has been between supporters of Inkatha _ a
Zulu political organization headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi _ and
members of the banned United Democratic Front, a multiracial
organization.
   The Front supporters oppose the participation of Buthelezi and
Inkatha in the KwaZulu homeland government; Buthelezi condemns the
Front's use of boycotts and encouragement of economic sanctions
against South Africa. Buthelezi also opposes the guerrilla tactics
of the African National Congress, which is affiliated with the
United Democratic Front.
   African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu, recently freed
from prison, blamed the Natal violence on the government's policy
of dividing blacks into tribal homelands.
   In a speech Sunday in Transkei, the homeland of the Xhosa
people, Sisulu said: ``The policy of divide and rule is one which
we will destroy.'' He said the frequently interrupted attempts to
bring the Natal factions together in peace talks had been
``resuscitated.''
   Police headquarters in Pretoria said Monday that 10 black
civilians had been killed in Natal in the past 24 hours.
   Also, police said, a black municipal policeman was hit on the
head with a blunt instrument and killed Sunday in the township of
Steadville, near Ladysmith; a black sergeant was shot to death by
three blacks as he got into his car after visiting a colleague in
Gamalakhe, near Port Shepstone on Saturday night; and a reserve
constable was surrounded by a group of 15 blacks and stabbed to
death as he left a rural homestead near Inanda on Friday night.
   The report said most of the violence occurred at KwaMashu, a
black township on the outskirts of the Indian Ocean city of Durban,
where 25,000 people had marched to the police station Sunday to
present a petitition accusing the police of brutality. United
Democratic Front supporters say most KwaZulu police favor Inkatha,
and Buthelezi is the chief of the homeland police.
   Police did not say whether the violence preceded or followed the
march, but one man was found stabbed to death, one beaten to death
and two burnt to death. A black constable, defending himself
against a crowd, fired birdshot, killing a man, police said. Two
other men and a 15-year-old boy were stabbed by crowds in three
separate incidents, police said. Unknown attackers shot or stabbed
to death other black men in several townships in the province,
police said.

   Residents of this seaside community
can kiss holiday mistletoe goodbye, along with Christmas trees and
sleigh bells, because the city has given traditional street
decorations the heave ho-ho-ho.
   Rudolph has been replaced by Flipper. Jonathon Livingston
Seagull outranks the snowman.
   Old St. Nick will ride into town under a wave of ocean-themed
vinyl banners depicting sea gulls, dolphins and kelp.
   ``The generic candle and Christmas wrapping could go in Des
Moines or Cincinnati,'' said artist Laddie John Dill.
   ``I wanted something that was more tailored to Santa Monica ...
which has become the arts center of California,'' added Dill, who
designed the banners with graphic artist John Van Hamersveld.
   The Santa Monica Area Chamber of Commerce commissioned the 225
banners, which are being strung up on lampposts this week. Each
3-foot-by-7-foot banner shows a gull, dolphin or sea weed.
   ``We didn't want to just make it Christmas bells and carolers,''
said Michael Segal, who headed the design project as a member of
the chamber's central business district advisory group.
   ``The kelp gives a mistletoe feeling, the dolphins are in a
wreath design and the gull looks like a Christmas dove of peace,''
Segal said.

   Cody Jacobs is giving thanks for a year
that's been his dream come true as one of former President Ronald
Reagan's biggest fans.
   Jacobs' good fortune started last summer when he was named one
of five Reagan Scholars and awarded four years free tuition at
Reagan's alma mater, tiny Eureka College.
   Then, the 19-year-old Arkansas City, Kan., native was elected
freshman class president, putting him right on his self-imposed
schedule for reaching his ultimate life's goal: president of the
United States.
   Next week, Jacobs is going to California to meet his idol and
role model.
   ``This will fullfill my lifelong dream,'' Jacobs said from his
dorm room, where the walls are covered with pictures of the Gipper,
framed letters from the former commander-in-chief and campaign
posters.
   ``I'm a total Reagan fanatic,'' Jacobs said. ``It started in
fourth grade when a teacher sparked my awareness in politics with a
real intense history lesson on the presidency.''
   School officials say Jacobs' devotion to Reagan is genuine.
   ``Cody is unique and may be the most politically inclined of the
Reagan Scholars we've had since the program started in 1983,'' said
Rolf Craft, director of the scholarship program.

   Workers tested pipelines of a 22-mile
rural water system Monday to find a leak that has deprived as many
as 400 families of water for nearly two weeks.
   Army National Guardsmen and volunteer firefighters trucked in
water Sunday for use by customers of the
Nellieburg-Tanglewood-Suqualena Water Association in west
Lauderdale County after county officials declared an emergency,
said Sandy Metrolis, director of the Lauderdale Emergency
Management agency.
   ``They obviously have a problem on the system somewhere. It
seems to be a gigantic leak,'' Metrolis said Monday.
   More than 5,000 gallons of water for drinking and household use
were trucked into the area.
   The leak apparently sprang Nov. 14, officials said; water
pressure declined steadily until some homes lost all water about a
week ago.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   HANDICAPPED
   
   The court refused to let public schools cut off educational help
to severely handicapped children even though they may not be able
to benefit from such services.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by a New
Hampshire school district ordered to help a profoundly retarded
13-year-old boy.
   The case has attracted widespread attention from educators and
state and local government officials nationwide who supported the
appeal by the Rochester, N.H., school district.
   At issue is the duty of states and local school officials under
the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which
provides federal aid and in turn requires programs to help such
children.
   The case is Rochester, N.H., vs. Timothy W., 89-515.
   
   HOMELESSNESS
   
   The court dealt a blow to New York City's campaign to halt the
spread of homelessness by refusing to revive a local law
successfully challenged by developers.
   The justices, without comment, left intact a ruling that a law
banning conversion or demolition of single-room-occupancy housing
unconstitutionally confiscates private property.
   The cases are New York City vs. Seawall Associates, 89-388;
Coalition for the Homeless vs. Seawall, 89-403; Wilkerson vs.
Seawall, 89-552.
   
   STRIP SEARCH
   
   The court turned down an appeal by Kentucky law enforcement
officials sued for strip-searching a woman charged with operating
her car without proper registration or insurance.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that
strip-searching people accused of minor traffic violations
generally violates their rights.
   The case is Frey vs. Masters, 89-576.
   
   PIT BULLS
   
   The court left intact an Overland Park, Kan., ordinance
restricting the ownership and possession of ``pit bull dogs.''
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the city ordinance is unconstitutionally too vague.
   The case is Hearn vs. Overland Park, 89-412.
   
   WESTIES
   
   The court rejected appeals by four men and a woman convicted for
their roles in a hoodlum gang, the Westies, in the Hell's Kitchen
section of New York City.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the five
were prosecuted fairly.
   The cases are Coonan vs. U.S., 89-379; Ritter vs. U.S., 89-5497;
Bokun vs. U.S., 89-5512; McElroy vs. U.S., 89-5601.
   
   TELEPHONE BILLS
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a telephone company ordered to
notify customers, along with their monthly bills, of their right to
join a lawsuit against the company.
   The court, without comment, let stand a Colorado ruling that the
company's free-speech rights are not violated by requiring it to
include such notices with its bills.
   The case is Mountain States Telephone vs. District Court of
Denver, 89-531.
   
   KENNEDY
   
   The court rejected the appeal of a Hollywood, Calif., man who
sued the Senate Judiciary Committee over its unanimous vote last
year favoring Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's appointment to the high
court.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out
Monte Lee's lawsuit.
   Kennedy did not participate in considering Lee's appeal or in
the court's action today.
   Lee's suit contended that the committee's 14 senators violated
his rights by voting for Kennedy without investigating allegations
of wrongdoing against the nominee.
   The case is Lee vs. Biden, 89-591.

   A woman was in critical condition today
after nine hours of surgery to receive a new liver, following a
plea from track star Carl Lewis to help locate an organ.
   Hospital officials said Wendy Marx was in critical but stable
condition following the emergency liver transplant surgery. Doctors
put her on a national organ donor list last week, and by
Thanksgiving grouped her among patients most urgently in need of
transplants.
   Marx, 22, went into surgery at 10:30 p.m. Sunday for the
transplant that ended about 7:30 this morning, said Pacific
Presbyterian Medical Center spokeswoman Julie Murray. Doctors began
monitoring her for signs of transplant rejection or infection.
   ``At this point, they (the doctors) were pleased with it,'' she
said. The liver came from an anonymous donor and it was not
immediately known if it was the result of Lewis' appeal.
   Lewis pleaded for the liver donor in a desperate attempt to save
Marx, the sister of a journalist who is helping to write Lewis'
autobiography.
   Earlier, Marx was clinging to life in a coma earlier and doctors
gave her 24 hours to live without the operation.
   Marx, the sister of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jeff Marx,
had swelling on her brain and was likely to have irreversible brain
damage without an immediate liver transplant, doctors said.
   ``I am here to ask for help in saving a young woman's life,''
Lewis said.
   Lewis pleaded for a donor Saturday and stayed at the hospital
with the Marx family again Sunday, saying the case indicates the
``desperate need'' for organ donors throughout the nation.
   ``This has hit me like no athletic event ever has,'' said Lewis,
28.
   Marx suffered irreparable liver damage after contracting
hepatitis B several weeks ago and has been hospitalized for the
past week.
   Lewis, an Olympic gold medalist in 1984 and 1988, has been
active in support of a national donor network. Lewis and the Marx
family became elated about 10 p.m. Saturday when it seemed a donor
had been found. The liver, however, turned out to have been damaged
in a car accident.

   Republican J. Marshall Coleman said today
he will seek a recount and contest the results of the governor's
race, which he narrowly lost to Democrat L. Douglas Wilder by less
than half a percentage point.
   In official returns certified today by the State Board if
Elections, Wilder received 897,139 votes to 890,285 for Coleman out
of nearly 1.8 million ballots cast for a margin of 6,854 votes, or
.38 percent.
   Coleman's announcement came about three hours before the State
Board of Elections announced the official results of closest
gubernatorial election in Virginia history.
   The unofficial returns from the Nov. 7 election had shown Wilder
defeating Coleman by 6,852 votes.
   Coleman said previously he probably would seek a recount if the
certified margin of Wilder's victory was less than one half-percent
of the 1.78 million votes cast, or about 9,000 votes.
   Coleman had until Dec. 7 to request a recount but today was the
deadline for contesting the election to the state Legislature
because of alleged irregularities.
   ``In an election as close as this one, irregularities which
would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a
greater importance,'' Coleman said in a letter to leaders of the
Democrat-controlled General Assembly.
   Susan Fitz-Hugh, secretary of the board of elections, said there
is no precedent for a statewide recount. She has declined to
estimate the length of time or cost of the recount, which would be
overseen by a panel of three judges headed by the chief judge of
the Richmond Circuit Court.
   Wilder has distanced himself from debate over whether Coleman
should accept the certified vote.
   ``We've said all along the ball is in the loser's court,''
Wilder spokeswoman Laura Dillard said.
   Wilder has proceeded with plans for his inauguration Jan. 13 as
Virginia's third straight Democratic governor, and has named a
transition team.
   The grandson of slaves and former state senator from Richmond
was elected lieutenant governor in 1985.

   A prosecutor told a judge today he will
put officials on the stand to support the state's contention that a
former Exxon tanker skipper should not escape prosecution for
causing the nation's worst oil spill.
   At a pretrial hearing in the case of Joseph Hazelwood, state
Assistant Attorney General Leonard Linton Jr. said he planned to
call several Coast Guard officers and a state environmental
official as witnesses.
   Linton told Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone that he also
planned to put on the stand residents of Ellamar, a Prince William
Sound village from which the Exxon Valdez was seen after it became
impaled on Bligh Reef.
   Hazelwood was captain of the 987-foot tanker when it ripped its
hull open on the reef early March 24 after leaving the Alaska oil
pipeline terminal at Valdez. The vessel spilled nearly 11 million
gallons of heavy North Slope crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   Shortly after the spill, Exxon fired Hazelwood, a veteran
mariner from Huntington, N.Y.
   Hazelwood, 43, is accused of reckless endangerment, operating a
vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil, all
misdemeanors, and three felony counts of criminal mischief.
   His trial is set for Jan. 22.
   Hazelwood's lawyers have said they would try to get his case
thrown out on claims of immunity, a flawed sobriety test and other
grounds.
   Defense motions included claims that Hazelwood received immunity
from prosecution when he reported his ship's grounding and the oil
spill the morning it happened. A law intended to encourage
self-reporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills
provides protection against self-incrimination, laywers contend.
   They say virtually every piece of evidence in the case against
Hazelwood grew from his report to the Coast Guard that the Exxon
Valdez was aground and leaking oil.
   Linton said, however, that discovery of the spill was
inevitable. He contends the position that Hazelwood's informing the
Coast Guard ultimately led to the evidence against him is
groundless.
   A federal judge in Fairbanks refused last month to block
Hazelwood's trial in state court.
   The oil blackened hundreds of miles of shoreline, killed tens of
thousands of birds and marine mammals and disrupted lucrative
fishing seasons. Exxon said it spent more than $1 billion on oil
spill claims and cleanup work, and state officials say the cleanup,
suspended for the winter, is unfinished.
   The case was moved from Valdez to Anchorage because of concerns
that publicity about the spill would make it too hard to find an
impartial jury. The port in south-central Alaska relies heavily on
the oil industry for jobs and also has commercial fishing interests.
   If convicted of the three felonies, Hazelwood faces a possible
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $100,000 in fines.

   The president dissolved Parliament on
Monday, leaving Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and a caretaker
government to see India through what could be weeks of
post-election uncertainty.
   Gandhi's Congress Party had overwhelming control of Parliament,
but voters in the world's most populous democracy took it away in
three days of elections that began Wednesday, and left the party
far short of a majority.
   To retain power, Congress must find partners for would be the
first coalition government since India became independent of
Britain in 1947.
   The prime minister, who won a landslide victory for the Congress
Party two months after the Oct. 31, 1984, assassination of his
mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was leading his own race for
re-election to Parliament.
   Vote tabulations put Congress ahead of any single opposition
group, but not far enough to govern alone.
   The party of Gandhi's grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, has been
out of power only once _ for 29 months that began after an election
loss in 1977 to an alliance that later came apart. The prime
ministers during those 29 months were Moraji Desai and Charan Singh.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman took the first step toward a
coalition Monday by dissolving Parliament, on the Cabinet's
recommendation. Parliament normally is dissolved before elections,
but Indian law does not require it.
   Growing opposition to Gandhi's leadership was reported within
his party.
   ``If Congress wants to win anything, the prime minister must
go,'' said Bhabani Sen Gupta, an independent analyst. ``With Rajiv
Gandhi, very few things are possible. Without Rajiv Gandhi, many
things are possible.''
   When all votes are counted, the president probably will ask the
party with the most seats to try assemble a majority in the
543-seat Lok Sabha, or House of People, the lower house of
Parliament where the power lies.
   Many opposition leaders argued the president should turn to the
party or alliance with the most popular support, regardless of the
number of seats involved.
   The two largest opposition groups, the five-party National Front
and the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata (Indian People's) Party,
opened talks on a forming a coalition.
   Yashwant Sinha, spokesman for the Janata Dal, or People's Party,
the main group in the National Front, said: ``The National Front
will form the next government.
   ``Our position will be quite clear in the next two or three
days. We will know who will be in the ... government, who the
leader will be, and we will approach the president and tell him
that we are in a position to form the next government.''
   State TV compiled results from the Election Commission. By
Monday night, winners were known for 400 of the 525 seats at stake
in the elections held Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.
   Congress Party and its smaller allies had 193 seats, and the
National Front 89. The opposition alliance is led by Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, a former Congress Party member and trusted Cabinet
minister.
   Bharatiya Janata, which wants to transform India from a secular
to a Hindu state, had 70 seats. The others went to smaller parties
and independent candidadtes.
   Singh, 58, was expected to win his constituency in northern
Uttar Pradesh state, but the count was delayed by floods.
   Both Congress and Bharatiya Janata dismissed the possibility of
a coalition between them.
   ``We will contemptuously reject any overtures,'' said Anand
Sharma, a Congress Party spokesman. ``Congress is not in a tearing
hurry. We refuse to think of compromising on principles to form the
government. We do not go to anybody to seek support.''
   He acknowledged ``something did go wrong'' in the election, but
insisted the party was solidly behind Gandhi.
   Lal Krishna Advani, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party,
said: ``I will not make deals with the Congress Party. I will see
to it that they fall from power.'' His party won only two seats in
1984.
   Gandhi, a former airline pilot, was carried to power a wave of
sympathy after Sikh bodyguards killed his mother, and Congress
captured an unprecedented 415 seats in the Lok Sabha.
   Euphoria greeted his promises to moderize the nation of 880
million people and prepare it for the 21st century, but soon was
dispelled by allegations of corruption and ineptitude in Gandhi's
government.
   Most corruption reports teemmed from newspaper investigations of
alleged kickbacks in a 1986 deal with Bofors, the Swedish arms
manufacturer.
   Several papers claimed Bofors paid up to $50 million in
kickbacks to get a $1.4 billion artillery contract. Gandhi denied
such payments were made, but could not shake the scandal.

   Jerry R. Curry took office as the nation's top
highway safety official Monday, saying he would seek to reduce
highway deaths by emphasizing seat belt use and curbing drunken
driving.
   Curry, 57, a retired Army major general, was sworn in as
administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration. President Bush nominated Curry for the post and the
Senate confirmed the appointment earlier this month.
   ``Our mission is clear,'' Curry said. He said his goals included
boosting safety belt usage from the current 46 percent to 70
percent by 1992, reducing fatalities involving impaired driving and
lowering the overall highway death rate to 2.2 deaths per 100
million miles traveled by 1992. In 1988, the rate was 2.4.
   Curry is a former assistant defense secretary for public affairs.

   The Communist Party daily Pravda, in its loudest
praise so far for the political changes in Czechoslovakia, on
Monday called it a ``natural and appropriate'' process of renewal.
   The Pravda commentary also indicted the old Czechoslovak
leadership for letting its chance to oversee reform go by, saying
it ``waited, vacillated, for every step forward made one step
back.''
   In a similar vein, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri
Gremitskikh said the government hopes the growing dialogue among
political groups in Czechoslovakia ``will further the renewal of
socialism in Czechoslovakia.''
   Asked about the absence in the Soviet press of a congratulatory
telegram from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the new head of the
Czechoslovak Communist Party, Karel Urbanek, Gremitskikh dismissed
it as having no significance.
   he lack of the customary telegram could have been construed as a
sign of disfavor. But Gremitskikh attributed it to logistical
problems, saying ``the telegram is on the way and will be
published, so there is nothing dramatic'' in its delay.
   He also indicated the Soviet Union won't reject the 1968
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia to crush the
``Prague Spring'' reform until the Czechoslovak leadership does its
own historical revision.
   ``If there is to be a re-evaluation, it has to be a
re-evaluation by everyone,'' Gremitskikh said.
   Pravda concluded that ``Czechoslovakia is once again on a
crossroads. There, the natural and appropriate process of the
renewal of socialism, which started earlier in other countries of
Eastern Europe, is taking place.''
   Correspondent S. Vtorushin commented that Czechoslovakia has the
advantage of being able to look to the other Eastern European
reforms _ in East Germany, Hungary and Poland _ to profit from
their experience.
   Soviet TV repeatedly has broadcast footage of the hundreds of
thousands of protesters in Prague's streets and newspapers have
carried accounts of the leadership reshuffle as well.
   Despite the Soviet Union's recent problems with strikes,
particularly in coal mines that involved hundreds of thousands of
workers, Tass on Monday carried a brief factual account of
Czechoslovakia's general strike as well.

<TEXT>
   The Ethiopian government and Eritrean rebels have
resolved a knotty issue in their preliminary peace talks by
inviting former Tanzanian President Julius K. Nyerere to be
co-chairman of future talks, said former President Jimmy Carter.
   Carter, who has been mediating the latest round of talks in
Nairobi, Kenya, said the negotiations almost broke down twice, but
``both sides got what they wanted by Saturday.''
   Carter commented to The Atlanta Constitution in an interview
published Monday.
   The decision to invite Nyerere to join him as co-chairman of the
main talks was the last of 12 agenda items for the preliminary
talks, he said.
   Delegates from the government and the rebel Eritrean People's
Liberation Front resumed talks last week in Nairobi after agreeing
on nine issues in Atlanta in September. Carter said the delegates
have now resolved the three remaining issues: a co-chairman, a
secretariat and observers.
   The nations that will be asked to observe future talks on ending
28 years of war will be named this week, when the preliminary talks
are expected to end, Carter said.
   He said Nyerere has been traveling in Asia and had not yet
responded to the requests from both delegations to participate, but
added that he expects Nyerere to accept the invitation.
   ``He has indicated in the past that he would if the invitation
came from both sides, and not just from me,'' Carter said.
   Carter flew through Sudan and Ethiopia on Sunday while the
negotiating teams took a break.
   Carter met with Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir in
Khartoum for 90 minutes. Carter helped arrange preliminary peace
talks Dec. 1 between Bashir's government and southern rebels, but
he will not be directly involved.
   Carter and Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam discussed
the Nairobi talks in Addis Ababa. Carter also met with three
members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is based in
Ethiopia's capital.
   Carter initiated the Ethiopian peace talks in Atlanta, and he
said Sunday that he was pleased with their progress. However, he
cautioned that trust is still lacking between the Ethiopians and
the Eritreans.
   ``There were a couple of times when the talks almost broke up
when one side or the other announced that they were leaving,'' he
said. ``There is still a lot of misunderstanding, a lot of
mistrust.''
   Carter said he cannot guarantee the success of the main
negotiations, but added: ``If I didn't think there was hope, I
wouldn't be spending my time out here.''

   An Oklahoma City physician and his wife, both
inflicted with multiple sclerosis, were saluted by President Bush
on Monday as ``an inspiration to us all'' for their volunteer work
in running a free medical clinic.
   Bush said he was bestowing his second daily ``Point of Light''
award to Dr. William Hale and his wife, Sandy.
   Bush presented the first award to the Memphis Commercial Appeal
last Wednesday for articles spotlighting outstanding volunteers in
the community and said he would issue the recognition daily.
   John Galletta, a White House aide, said that, starting with the
Hales, a new recipient would be announced every day but Sunday.
   ``It is not an awards program as such,'' Galletta said. ``This
is just recognition. These programs are representative of
outstanding work being done throughout the country.''
   In a statement, the White House called Hale the ``driving
force'' behind the all-volunteer clinic that has operated from a
Baptist mission center in Oklahoma City for 15 years.
   The clinic, which is run entirely by volunteers and accepts no
government funds, has treated nearly 43,000 indigent people, the
statement said.
   ``After learning that some of their patients could not afford to
buy prescriptions, the Hales arranged for donations of medicine
from local pharmacies as well,'' it said.
   ``The president extends his deepest appreciation to the Hales
for their outstanding work. Their courage and determination is an
inspiration to us all.''
   The Hales will get a letter from the president praising them for
their work, Galletta said.

   Here are some details of the procedure for
Monday's historic operation, in which surgeons sought to remove a
portion of a mother's liver and transplant it in her ailing
21-month-old daughter. Times are Central Standard.
   _ 7:35 a.m.: Teresa Smith, a 29-year-old schoolteacher from
suburban San Antonio, Texas, is wheeled unconscious into an
operating room at the University of Chicago Medical Center for
removal of a portion of her liver.
   During the procedure, the surgeon opens the abdominal area,
removes the left lobe of the liver _ about one-third of the organ _
and closes the incision with sutures.
   The portion removed for transplant contains all the blood
vessels the liver needs to function properly.
   After the vessels supplying the lobe have been clamped off, it
is filled with chilled liver-preservation solution. This maintains
the condition of the liver portion until removal is completed.
   During this first phase of the two-step procedure, a retractor
device used to hold back tissue came loose and damaged Mrs. Smith's
spleen. ``There was a lot of blood loss'' and doctors had to remove
the spleen, said hospital spokesman Ed Ernst.
   The complication was not considered a major setback, he said.
   But it was expected to delay completion of the procedure by
three to four hours, Ernst said. Doctors had estimated the surgery
would take up to nine hours.
   _ 12 Noon: Mrs. Smith's daughter, Alyssa Smith, 21 months, was
taken into the operating room for preparation.
   Standard techniques for vascular surgery are used to connect the
recipient's arteries with the vessels leading to the new liver. The
average patient needs about a pint of blood during surgery.
   Details on Alyssa's operation were not available, but liver
transplants normally take from six to eight hours, Ernst said.

   The European Community Commission said
Monday it has signed a trade and economic cooperation accord with
the Soviet Union that goes beyond similar deals signed in the past
14 months with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   The pact provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas on
Soviet industrial goods by 1995 and cites a dozen areas in which
the two sides plan to establish economic cooperation, an EC source
said.
   These include science and technology, banking, transport,
agriculture, environmental protection, energy, raw materials and
mining. The accord excludes trade in goods considered to be
sensitive militarily, according to the source, who asked not to be
identified.
   He said the agreement calls for reciprocity in trade benefits.
``That is the objective of this accord ... to get an effective
access to the Russian market for EC products,'' the source said.
   Officials could not give an assessment of the economic impact of
the agreement.
   EC trade with Eastern Europe is small. It totaled $56 billion in
1987, the last year for which complete figures are available.
EC-Soviet trade that year was only $24.6 billion.
   The agreement with Moscow was reached after five days of talks
between EC Commission and Soviet negotiators. It must be approved
by the 12 EC states and the European Parliament.
   That is a formality, however, given the EC's interest in
increasing economic links with Eastern Europe and getting access to
its market of 390 million consumers.
   The Soviet accord, negotiated in about four months, is the
fourth the EC has signed with an East European nation in just over
a year.
   It signed a trade and economic cooperation agreement with
Hungary in September 1988; a more limited deal with Czechoslovakia
covering only trade in manufactured goods was signed in December
1988; and an agreement with Poland was signed Sept. 19.
   These accords follow a June 25, 1988, agreement under which the
EC and the Moscow-led Comecon trade bloc, after years of ignoring
one another, signed a mutual recognition agreement in Luxembourg.
   The EC on Monday also widened market access for farm and textile
goods from Poland and Hungary. Through the measure, which will be
in effect only during 1990, the EC suspended import quotas for the
two countries that are fixed through the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the world trade body.
   In a statement, the 12 EC foreign ministers said the one-year
lifting of quotas was an ``exceptional solution to an exceptional
problem'' and represents no change in the EC's overall position on
quotas in world trade.
   The move follows an EC decision Nov. 6 to increase market access
for industrial goods from Poland and Hungary.
   The EC foreign ministers were notified of the agreement with the
Soviet Union but did not discuss the issue in depth.
   The Soviet accord goes further than any other deal the EC has
signed with an East European nation, notably by subjecting nuclear
energy safety and mining to economic cooperation, sources said.
   Also on Monday, European Community External Relations
Commissioner Frans Andriessen called developments in Czechoslovakia
of the last week ``a cause for profound rejoicing throughout
Europe.''
   ``Political reform and economic liberalization in Czechoslovakia
form part of a wider process which, for the first time in more than
40 years, offers to future generations the prospect of a Europe no
longer riven by division,'' he said.
   EC officials said it was too early to speak of a widening of the
accord with Czechoslovakia.
   The Commission is still negotiating trade and economic
cooperation agreements with Bulgaria and East Germany. Talks with
East Germany are in an ``exploratory'' stage but will likely be
speeded up by next week's visit to East Berlin by Andriessen.
   East Germany has asked the EC for an accord on trade and
economic cooperation. The EC has broken off talks for closer
economic ties with Romania in view of its human rights record.

<HEAD>San Francisco Mayor Launches Tourism Campaign in Chicago</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who left their hearts in San Francisco can
come back for them anytime, the city's mayor said Monday. The city
by the bay, hit by a killer earthquake Oct. 17, is eager to welcome
visitors again.
   ``I came to say `Thank you' to the people of Chicago and the
people of the Midwest,'' Mayor Art Agnos said at a news conference
with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during his first stop on a
three-city tour.
   He said Chicago was the first city to send food after the
7.1-magnitude quake, which killed 67 people and caused $7 billion
in damages in the San Francisco Bay area.
   Daley, a friend of Agnos, sent Chicago-style deep-dish pizza,
cheesecake and beer, the visiting mayor said.
   Agnos said he also came ``to tell people here in the Midwest
that we're ready to offer the same kind of hospitality that San
Francisco is famous for.''
   Tourism, which is San Francisco's No. 1 business and generates
$3.4 billion a year, is still reeling from the effects of the
quake, he said.
   Tourism dropped off sharply after the quake, and is about 80
percent of normal, Agnos said.
   Media coverage of the quake focused on spectacular damage, and
has many potential visitors thinking the entire area was leveled,
he said.
   He noted that the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which was
closed when a 50-foot section of its upper deck fell on the lower
deck, has reopened and that traffic is flowing normally.
   Agnos also said many people who live in the heavily damaged
Marina district returned home for Thanksgiving when electricity and
gas were restored six weeks ahead of schedule.
   However, San Francisco's homeless population has nearly doubled
because many of the hotels with single-occupancy rooms occupied by
low-income residents were destroyed, the mayor said.
   And the city's two elevated freeways will be closed for repairs
until at least June, he said.
   But everything else is back to normal, said Agnos, who plans to
spread the word in New York and Washington on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Petr Varga's hands were almost
blue from the cold as he held up one of the hundreds of signs,
banners and flags rising from the human sea filling the street in
front of Prague's largest industrial plant.
   ``We have been waiting for this for years,'' said Varga, a
27-year-old mechanic. ``This is just wonderful.''
   He had been in a column of workers, many in stained overalls,
that poured into the street after sirens from two fire trucks
bedecked with the blue, red and white national flag sounded the
beginning of a two-hour general strike.
   The column joined tens of thousands filling the street to listen
to speakers addressing them from atop a flatbed truck.
   Signs called for free elections, an end to one-party rule and
free trade unions.
   Others greeted the Civic Forum, the opposition group that sprang
to life earlier this month after police brutally suppressed a
peaceful student demonstration.
   ``I never voted,'' said Varga, who said he makes about $350 a
month _ slightly less than the average pay of a blue-collar worker.
``I knew that these elections were always faked.''
   On top of the truck-turned-platform, workers mingled with
students and actors waiting to speak. Even three policemen wanted
to contribute.
   One after another, they called for a change in the system,
drawing rousing cheers and chanted slogans: ``Long live the
students!'' ``These are the demands of a free people!'' and
``Thanks to the Forum!''
   One worker demanded that all Czechoslovak Communists who helped
the Warsaw Pact invaders crush the ``Prague Soring'' reforms be
brought to trial.
   It was at the CKD plant, where Varga works, that the last
general strike was proclaimed two days after the invasion of Aug.
21, 1968.
   Jeers and shouts of ``Shame!'' went up when another speaker
cited the name of a CKD worker who was elected to the party's
ruling Politburo in a reshuffle of the leadership less than 12
hours earlier. ``He is not one of us!'' the crowd chanted.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' someone in the crowd said as the
rally ended with Czechoslovakia's national anthem.
   ``We will continue. Now we will go to Wenceslas Square for a new
demonstration. This is the 11th day,'' he said.
   ``It's fantastic,'' said a worker who identified himself only as
Martin. ``Imagine this comes after half a century of no freedom,
first under the Nazis and then under the Communists.''
   Martin said he went to the United States after the 1968 invasion
but returned a year later ``because I was homesick.''
   Flags were lowered from many windows of the drab apartment
blocks facing the 400-yard-long front of the plant, the largest of
the CKD group. Two men stood atop a building, swinging a flag
precariously close to the edge of the roof.
   ``Where is the people's militia?'' someone asked, referring to
the Communist Party's paramilitary force that had been guarding the
gates of all factories in recent days.
   At one point, they were officially reported to have been asked
to help police to ``maintain public order'' during the giant
demonstrations. ``Haven't seen them,'' was the answer from another
bystander. ``But they have sent word that they will never act
against the workers.''

<TEXT>
   Rafael Leonardo Callejas, the
opposition National Party's winning presidential candidate, called
Monday for talks with members of the Liberal Party on solving
Honduras' economic crisis.
   ``The only way to solve the problems of inflation and
unemployment is to create an economy that's strong and
productive,'' said Callejas, who beat Carlos Flores of the
incumbent Liberals in elections Sunday.
   Callejas, a 46-year-old U.S.-trained agricultural economist,
also accepted congratulations from minor party candidates and the
U.S. Embassy on his victory. Flores did not make a concession
statement.
   Callejas' inauguration Jan. 27 will mark the first peaceful
transition of power to an opposition party in Honduras in 57 years.
   ``What Hondurans have accomplished should prove to be an
inspirational example to other peoples of the region who also seek
democracy,'' the U.S. Embassy said in an obvious reference to
neighboring Nicaragua.
   The problem of Central American peace will be one of the first
and most difficult to confront Callejas. The country borders El
Salvador and Nicaragua, and Honduras has long served as a base for
U.S.-supported Contras trying to overthrow the Sandinista
government.
   El Salvador broke relations with Nicaragua on Sunday over arms
smuggling to Salvador's leftist guerrillas, and Callejas said he
would be willing to participate in a Central American summit if
incumbent President Jose Azcona Hoyo is agreeable.
   Callejas has said peace is vital to his effort to attract new
foreign investment to Honduras _ there has been no significant new
investment in years _ but he suggested no new ideas during the
campaign.
   He has said he supports the presence of U.S. troops on training
missions for as long as Central America remains unstable.
   Other problems Callejas will face include high unemployment _
estimates put the figure at 1 million in a nation of 5.2 million.
   War, refugees, inflation, a $3.2 billion foreign debt on which
no payment has been made this year and an economy closed by
protectionism have all combined to leave Honduras one of the
poorest nations in the hemisphere, with a per capita annual income
estimated at $500.
   Callejas said in a radio interview Monday that he would not
devalue the lempira, which has been pegged at 2-1 against the U.S.
dollar since 1918, although the current black market rate is 4-1.
   However, Callejas said he would attempt to install a two-tier
system with a 2-1 rate for things like petroleum and medicine, with
a free or different rate for other trade.
   Callejas, a moderate conservative who admires President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's efforts to modernize Mexico, has also promised
to decentralize the government, sell some state-owned companies,
cut the budget and create incentives for export and investment.
   Official vote totals were stalled by computer problems, but
unofficial vote totals gathered by radio and television showed
Callejas with a clear lead over Flores.
   With about 67 percent of the vote in, Callejas had 595,807
votes, or about 50.2 percent, to Liberal Carlos Flores' 526,110, or
about 44.3 percent.
   Callejas said he believed his party would take 69 or 70 of the
unicameral legislature's 130 seats, as well as the mayoralty ot
Tegucigalpa, the capital and largest city.
   The mayoralty of the second-largest city and commercial center,
San Pedro Sula, was in doubt, but a strong Nationalist showing
there showed how deeply Callejas had cut into the Liberals'
traditional strongholds.
   ``The Liberal Party didn't lose. The people of Honduras lost,''
said party treasuere Jorge Roberto Maradiaga.
   Flores, who reportedly was in San Pedro Sula, released no
statement Monday. His newspaper, La Tribuna, headlined ``Callejas
Claims Victory.''
   Below was another headline: ``Conservatives Also Win In
Uruguay.''

   Mission Control directed
Discovery's astronauts to remain in space at least an extra 90
minutes today because of high winds in California's Mojave Desert.
   The earliest new landing time for the secret military mission
was 4:31 p.m. PST, one orbit later than planned.
   The winds were not as strong as the 30 mph gusts that forced
NASA to call off a landing attempt on Sunday. But they were high
enough at nearly 20 mph to make landing conditions unacceptable at
all three shuttle landing runways.
   Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said forecasters
expected conditions to be acceptable at runway 17, on Rogers Dry
Lake, at the new tentative landing time.
   The five astronauts reportedly deployed a spy satellite during
their mission.
   Sunday's postponement marked the sixth time in 32 shuttle
flights that a landing has been delayed by weather.
   NASA initially rescheduled the landing for 4:32 p.m. PST today,
but Mission Control decided to bring the shuttle back at 2:52 p.m.
PST to reduce sun glare. About an hour before landing, the crew was
to ignite the shuttle's re-entry rockets for the fiery dive through
the atmosphere.
   ``The change to the earlier landing opportunity takes advantage
of higher sun angle, thereby reducing sun glare on Discovery's
windows during landing,'' Deason said Sunday night, about 1{ hours
after NASA announced the landing delay.
   NASA said today that the forecast was acceptable for this
afternoon, with a clear sky and 12 mph wind, gusting to 17 mph.
Mission rules dictate that a shuttle not land during the day if a
crosswind exceeds 17 mph, or 12 mph for night landings.
   The delay does not pose a threat to the astronauts because
Discovery carries enough fuel and other supplies to remain in orbit
at least through Tuesday.
   Discovery's commander is Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory.
His crew members are Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and
mission specialists Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. Story Musgrave
and Kathryn C. Thornton.
   In announcing the delay, Mission Control also said the
astronauts ``continued to be in excellent condition.'' But a
military-imposed news blackout that has shrouded most of the
mission kept space agency officials from discussing the crew's
reaction to the delay.
   If bad weather persisted at Edwards, other available landing
sites included White Sands, N.M., or Cape Canaveral, Fla. The
National Aeronautics and Space Administration prefers Edwards
because of the long, wide-open runways.
   Discovery's flight began Wednesday with a dazzling nighttime
liftoff at Cape Canaveral. It was the third shuttle launch after
dark, and Sunday's landing was to have been only the third at night.
   The after-dark blastoff was dictated by the shuttle's cargo and
its mission.
   Sources close to the project have said that the astronauts
achieved their main goal Thursday when they released the 2{-ton,
$300 million satellite to eavesdrop on communications in the Soviet
Union, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
   The astronauts also reportedly conducted experiments connected
with the ``Star Wars'' missile defense system. It was believed the
astronauts also conducted research into how people can serve as
military observers in space.
   As Discovery headed home, the space shuttle Columbia was being
prepared for a 10-day Christmas mission to deploy a Navy
communications satellite and retrieve a scientific payload that has
been orbiting the Earth for nearly six years. Columbia is scheduled
to be moved to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Administration Threatens To Suspend Financial Support Of UN</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration threatened Monday to
suspend all U.S. financial support for the United Nations if the
General Assembly recognizes Palestine as a country.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said there was
no such nation and it did not meet the U.N. criteria for membership.
   It was not immediately clear whether the U.S. threat would
thwart the drive planned by a number of Arab countries later in the
week in the General Assembly.
   The United States does not have veto power in the assembly. But
its support for the United Nations is essential to functioning of
the world body.
   The U.S. assessment for 1988 was $216 million, of which $65
million was paid in October.
   ``Any action to change the PLO status will have the most serious
adverse consequences for the U.N.,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The Assembly on Wednesday is due to begin a debate on the
Arab-Israeli conflict, with particular attention to the West Bank
and Gaza. The territories were lost by Jordan and Egypt to Israel
in the 1967 Mideast war.
   Palestinians in the territories have been demonstrating against
Israeli control for nearly two years. All the Arab governments,
meanwhile, recognize the PLO as the only legitimate representative
of the Palestinians.
   Earlier this year, the World Health Organization, which is a
U.N. agency, and the World Tourism Office, which is affiliated with
the United Nations, considered giving the PLO membership.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III threatened in May to
suspend U.S. assistance to any world organization that recognized
Palestine as a state. Both groups deferred further action.
   The PLO has observer status at the United Nations. The move
planned within the General Assembly would give it observer status
as a nation, rather than as an organization.
   In a parallel drive, several Arab governments were trying within
the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome to channel assistance
to Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza through the PLO. Also,
they would give the PLO national recgonition within the Food and
Agriculture Organization.
   Ms. Tutwiler, in behalf of the State Department, denounced that
drive as well.
   ``We strongly support humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian
peopple,'' she said.
   But, the official added: ``The PLO should not be a conduit for
international assistance to the Palestinians. The United States
continues to believe that raising this type of political issue in a
meeting of a technical U.N. body is wholly inappropriate. It does
nothing to contribute to the settlement of the political issue
involved, and does substantial harm to the FAO's credibility as an
organization worthy of U.S. support.''
   ``The United States opposes any enhancement in the U.N. of the
status of the self-proclaimed state of Palestine,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   Reading from a prepared statement, the U.S. official said
Palestine does not satisfy the criteria for statehood or meeting
the membership requirements of the United Nations.
   She said the State Department had sent messages to several
countries outlining the U.S. position and was making its views
known ``at the highest levels'' of the United Nations in New York.
   Asked if U.S. support would be withdrawn if the Assembly went
ahead, Ms. Tutwiler said: ``We feel so strongly about this we would
cut off funds.''

   A project to feed bald eagles with deer killed on
the highways is failing because the eagles are too finicky, federal
officials say.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been collecting mule deer
carcasses along highways, especially those close to the foothills
west of Denver, and bringing them to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal as
eagle food.
   But the bald eagles apparently are uninterested in the deer,
officials said, leaving the agency swamped with dead deer.
   ``We've got a third of a refrigerated semitrailer filled up, and
we're still averaging four deer a day from across the area,'' said
wildlife service biologist Mike Lockhart.
   Lockhart said the pilot project may have to be suspended. If so,
the business of disposing of road kills would fall back to county
crews, which typically dump the animals at landfills.
   The state wildlife division reports about 1,000 deer killed
annually on roads throughout the Front Range.
   Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Pete Gober in Lakewood said
Monday the project began in early November, when eagles arrive to
winter at the arsenal. It probably will continue as long as the
eagles stay, March, he said.

   Prosecutors proposed $100 fines Monday as
the total penalty for three state social workers accused of failing
to report suspected abuse before a toddler's death during toilet
training, attorneys said.
   ``This gives the appearance the state wants to give this case
away,'' said Nat White, attorney for defendant Shirley DuBoise. ``I
almost fell out of my chair when they made the offer.''
   Two-year-old Bradley McGee died July 28 after being repeatedly
dunked head-first into a toilet and pounded with pillows because he
soiled his diaper, prosecutors say.
   His mother and stepfather, Thomas and Sheryl Coe of Lakeland,
have been charged with first-degree murder, and the social workers
were accused of failing to act on earlier complaints the couple had
abused their son.
   Prosecutors offered the plea bargain Monday only to state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services program
administrator Kenneth Houk, supervisor Judy Ross and caseworker Ms.
DuBoise, who were charged with the second-degree misdemeanor Aug.
31 amid controversy over the boy's death.
   The misdemeanor charge carried a maximum penalty of 60 days in
jail.
   Another HRS caseworker, Margaret Barber, was charged with
aggravated child abuse in addition to the misdemeanor charge. No
plea offer was made to her, the attorneys said.
   As a result of the case, the Legislature earlier this month
allocated $39 million to pay for more caseworkers to prevent child
abuse.
   ``We make plea offers in cases every day. The fact that this is
a high-profile case makes no difference to me,'' said Assistant
State Attorney John Aguero, who refused to comment on the details
of the plea bargain.
   Any offer would have to be approved at a pre-trial hearing Dec.
28, Aguero said.
   Both White and Jack Wilkins, the attorney for Houk, said they
would advise their clients to take the deal only if it involves a
no-contest plea in which they do not have to admit guilt. Ms. Ross'
attorney, Glen Brock, was not immediately available for comment; he
was out of his office visiting clients.
   ``Even if it's a small fine, nobody wants this on their
record,'' Wilkins said.
   ``I think $100 is fair,'' White said. ``My feeling was that even
if they were found guilty, the judge would not be able to impose a
stiff sentence anyway.''
   Houk, Ms. Ross and Ms. Barber were temporarily suspended but
have returned to work. Ms. DuBoise quit her job Aug. 3.

<TEXT>
   A textbook used for introductory college
economics courses throughout the United States is being translated
into Russian for use in a nation looking for new economic ideas _
the Soviet Union.
   Campbell McConnell, professor of economics at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln, wrote the popular textbook ``Economics'' in 1960.
In its 11th edition, the book has been translated into Portuguese,
Spanish, German and French.
   McConnell recently completed a foreword for the Russian
translation, which McGraw-Hill Book Co. expects will take two to
three years to complete. In his introductory comments, McConnell
addresses the reduction in the past two decades of the high
economic growth rates that characterized the Soviet economy after
World War II and acknowledges the vigorous responses of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. McConnell also reviews the role of
a competitive price system in achieving and maintaining an
efficient allocation of scarce resources.
   ``It is perhaps in providing an overview of the functioning of a
competitive price system that this Russian translation of my text
will be of most interest to Soviet students and academicians who
are involved in the new thinking,'' he writes.
   McConnell says he tried to make clear that the U.S. market
system is not without faults and that ``going to a market economy
may solve some of the Soviet problems, but it is not a panacea.''
   University spokesman David Ochsner said there is a client for
the book, but the arrangements were made by McGraw-Hill and he did
not know who the client was. Calls to the publisher were not
immediately returned.

   The class system, that mysterious code the British
like to believe is uniquely their own, has suffered a double blow
in recent days.
   First comes a survey saying that Britons, for all their
fascination with accents, dress and good form, are no more
class-conscious than any other nation.
   No sooner has that shocking revelation been digested than a
schools association brandishes statistics to show that the old
school tie no longer binds.
   Only the other day Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was telling
Parliament: ``The old class-based order is being replaced by one
based on merit, ability and effort. This is the new Britain _ the
Britain for the 1990s.''
   Appropriately enough, the grocer's daughter who leads the
Conservative Party made her remarks during the first House of
Commons session to be televised. Television, like income tax and
traffic jams, is one of the great levelers of class in Britain.
   ``British Social Attitudes,'' a survey published this month by
Social and Community Planning Research, an independent research
institute, finds that Britain is fairly average by most social
indicators.
   After studying data from Britain, Italy, Austria, Holland, West
Germany, Hungary, the United States and Australia, the study
concludes: ``Britain does not emerge as an especially
class-conscious or class-bound society. Such differences as there
are have been talked up, as much by British observers as by anyone
else.''
   Meanwhile, a survey for the Independent Schools Information
Service points to massive changes in the makeup of the so-called
public schools, the private institutions from Eton downward that
have long been regarded as bastions of the upper classes.
   The survey reports that only six percent of public school kids
attend the same schools as their parents, and that 41 percent have
parents who weren't educated in public schools.
   ``The myth of the old school tie has been finally nailed,'' said
David Woodhead, national director of the service. ``The picture
that emerges is of a highly critical body of parents, unfettered by
traditional loyalties or by prejudice.''
   And yet debate rages on as to whether Britain is a class-bound
nation. The Daily Telegraph calls it ``The Great British
Obsession,'' while another newspaper, Today, devotes two pages to
demonstrate that the old class divisions that were based on money
and family lineage are being replaced by snobbery, a game anyone
can play.
   In January, the newspaper The Independent commissioned opinions
from writer Emma Tennant and Eton headmaster Eric Anderson.
   Ms. Tennant said that ``despite appearances to the contrary,
social class still holds this country in its grip,'' while Anderson
argued the opposite.
   He wrote that class barriers were crumbling, and pointed to
studies showing that by the year 2000, 70 percent of all job will
require brains, not brawn, compared with only 30 percent in 1945.
   ``If the class system is a divisive force, it is not a very
effective one,'' he wrote. And even if some parents still chose
Eton just for the social cachet, ``we take the boy anyway in the
confidence that we can teach him better values.''
   The Duke of Westminster doesn't believe that Mrs. Thatcher, even
after 10 years in power, can break down all the conventions built
up over the centuries.
   ``The class barriers have been broken down to a huge extent,
although certain conventions are adhered to,'' he said in an
interview.
   Accent is still a great pigeonholer, but nobody watching BBC-TV
news can help being struck by the gallimaufry of regional accents
that predominate among its reporters, from chainsaw Ulster through
Edinburgh burr to Midlands twang. The plummy BBC voices of 30 years
ago would be laughed out of the studio.

   A lack of state funding is delaying
court-ordered freedom for a retarded man who has been confined for
31 years at a state hospital, attorneys said Monday.
   Bernt Murphy, a 51-year-old who has the mental capability of an
8-year-old, has a full-time job and is ready to move from a group
home on the hospital grounds to a private community group home,
according to Lisa Marcy of the Legal Center for the Handicapped.
   However, she said, the state Division of Handicapped Services
must approve a contract for Murphy's care at the home at an
estimated annual cost of $60,000.
   Murphy was declared psychotic and committed to the state
hospital in 1957 after he was ruled incompetent to stand trial on
rape and murder charges.
   Doctors at the hospital said in 1972 that he had been cured of
his insanity; however, the Utah Supreme Court ruled in June 1988
that Murphy was retarded, not insane, and must be allowed to return
to the community.
   A 12-member committee assembled by District Judge Pat Brian to
coordinate Murphy's rehabilitation believes he is now ready to
leave the hospital, Marcy said.
   ``He has exceeded everyone's expectations,'' she said. She told
the judge she had hoped to see Murphy leave the hospital by
Thursday.
   Murphy is working as a dishwasher and helper at a local cafe,
earning the minimum wage, she said.
   Brian said he would accept the committee's plan, but not before
Handicapped Services explained the delay. He set a hearing for Jan.
22 to review the case.
   Last February, Murphy was permitted to move into the group home
on the hospital grounds and take the job, as long as he wore an
electronic ankle bracelet while outside the hospital. Three months
ago, Brian allowed him to remove the bracelet.

   Up to 48,000 people were buried in graves
that were already occupied at two cemeteries in a practice dating
to the 1920s, according to investigators for the state attorney
general's office.
   Three former officials of Louisville Crematories and Cemetery
Co., the city's oldest cemetery company, are to stand trial in
February on charges resulting from the investigation of Eastern and
Greenwood cemeteries.
   ``It may be beyond the abilities of most people to comprehend
just what has gone on out here,'' University of Louisville
archaeologist Phil DiBlasi, said in a recent interview.
   Some graves contained the remains of as many as six people, and
graves containing the remains of three or four are common, said
DiBlasi, whose team examined about 100 graves at the two cemeteries
in eastern Louisville.
   Remains from previous burials were found so often in a section
of Eastern Cemetery called Babyland that about 70 infants' bodies
were buried only 10 to 18 inches deep, employees have told
investigators.
   Jim Caldwell, an investigator for the state attorney general's
office, reported finding human bones throughout Eastern Cemetery:
in a truck's glove compartment, a tool box, a storage shed, dirt
piles and even a fast-food hamburger bag.
   Caldwell said he found ashes from 244 cremated bodies, many of
them unidentified, in a cabinet and on shelves in the celler of the
crematory at Eastern.
   DiBlasi said he and Caldwell also uncovered several buried
headstones. Although there are some unmarked graves at the
cemeteries, thousands have headstones.
   In July, a Jefferson County grand jury indicted three officials
on 60 counts, including reuse of graves and abuse of corpses.
   Charles Alexander Jr., executive director of Louisville
Crematories and Cemetery since May 1986; Clifford B. Amos Sr.,
board president and acting executive director from 1980 to 1986;
and Robert Copley, board vice president and a company employee
since 1987 face 188 to 268 years in prison and fines of up to
$4,000 if convicted. The company could be fined up to $1.12 million.
   The three men resigned from the company.
   DiBlasi said he had determined that the practice of reusing
graves had been going on long before the three joined the company.
   ``This isn't something that started with these folks back in the
'70s,'' as was first suspected, he said.
   DiBlasi said his team's excavations indicated that graves were
being reused as early as the mid-1920s at Eastern. Cemetery records
indicate it was probably full shortly after the turn of the century.
   Eastern, which occupies 15 acres, had enough room for about
18,000 bodies under existing standards, but investigators estimate
about 51,000 were buried there, according to DiBlasi and Caldwell.
   Caldwell's report estimated that about 15,000 too many bodies
were buried at Greenwood. That would put the estimated number of
bodies in previously used graves at both cemeteries at 48,000.
   Louisville Crematories and Cemetery, a 141-year-old company
which has mostly served Louisville's poor and middle class, also
operates Schardein Cemetery.
   The company came under scrutiny in May when employee Bob Allen
called the attorney general's office, Caldwell's report said.
   Allen, a gravedigger and maintenance worker, said graves were
reused throughout the eight years he worked for the company. He
said that at one point within the past year a skull was dug up and
inadvertently left sitting atop a dirt pile during a funeral.
   The grieving family never saw the skull, ``and we put it back in
the hole after they left,'' he said.

<HEAD>More States Require Competency Testing For Teachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-four states now require school teachers
to pass competency tests _ up from just 10 in 1980, the American
Institutes for Research said Monday in its annual teacher testing
survey.
   The not-for-profit scientific research firm, which specializes
in behavioral and social sciences, said only 10 states required
teacher testing for elementary and secondary schools back in 1980.
   Now, the only states that do not administer competency tests are
Alaska, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, South Dakota and Vermont.
   Teachers have had little problem passing the tests, according to
the study, which was conducted as part of the federally funded ERIC
Clearinghouse on Tests, Measurement, and Evaluation. The
clearinghouse, which is operated by American Institutes, provides
information on educational testing and evaluation.
   States commonly use two types of tests to assess teacher
competency _ certification tests for graduates of teacher education
programs and admissions tests for people who apply to teacher
education programs before they can be enrolled. Most tests are
standardized variety, but a few states use customized tests created
exclusively for their own jurisdiction.
   Thirty-six states now administer teacher certification tests.
Twenty-six states require admissions tests and 18 states require
teachers to pass both admissions and certification tests.
   Although some states with testing programs do not collect and
report passing rate information, the survey said the passing rates
on certification tests range from a low of 69 percent in Delaware
to a high of 97 percent in Kansas.
   On admissions tests, passing rates range from a low of 58
percent in Colorado to a high of 95 percent in Nevada.

<HEAD>Break in Relations Sets Back Central American Peace Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prospects for peace in Central
America, battered by fierce battles this month between Salvadoran
rebels and the government, were further set back by El Salvador's
break in relations with Nicaragua.
   The move Sunday by rightist President Alfredo Cristiani capped a
series of events that indicates more tension, conflict and war lies
ahead in the troubled region.
   Cristiani, who suspended relations to protest the alleged
shipment of sophisticated arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador's
leftist rebels, called Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega ``a
puppet of international communist aggression.''
   Ortega said he was glad not to have relations with ``a genocidal
government that kills priests.''
   He was referring to the Salvadoran air force's strafing and
rocketing of populated neighborhoods of the capital in response to
a new guerrilla offensive and to the slaying of six Jesuit
educators on Nov. 16. A witness has testified the killers of the
Jesuits wore army uniforms.
   Two regional counterparts, President Jose Azcona of Honduras and
Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, expressed their regret at the rupture in
relations.
   ``Now, the process of peace in the region has stagnated,''
Azcona told reporters last weekend. He said the break makes his
borders with both countries more tense and ``exacerbates even more
the region's social and political crisis.''
   Arias, the principal author of a 1987 regional accord designed
to bring peace to the war-torn isthmus, issued a communique saying
he ``laments'' the break in relations because ``it expresses the
gravity of the developments of the past days.''
   Immediately after announcing the suspension of relations,
Cristiani said he would not attend next week's summit of Central
American presidents set in Managua. The session is intended as a
follow up on the Arias peace plan.
   The Costa Rican president issued an urgent call Monday for a
change of venue. Cristiani's reason for balking was the site, a
country he contends is aiding the effort to topple his government.
   In Managua, Roberto Lopez Geissel, the Salvadoran charge
d'affaires, said his country had been planning for several months
to upgrade the mission, name him ambassador and increase the staff
and office space.
   Nicaragua withdrew its charge d'affaires and other diplomats
from El Salvador on Nov. 18 as a ``precautionary measure.''
   El Salvador recalled its ambassador after the Sandinistas came
to power in a 1978-79 revolution and the Salvadoran Embassy was
fired upon, Lopez Geissel said. Since then, the mission has been
headed by a series of six charges d'affaires, he said.
   The schism came only days after developments that complicated
matters on the region's other war front, between the Sandinista
army and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Negotiations in Washington between the two sides broke down last
week. On Saturday, Ortega responded bitterly to Honduran
expressions of concern about Sandinista army concentrations near
Nicaragua's border with Honduras.
   ``These Hondurans are crazy,'' said Ortega. ``We'll put our
troops wherever the hell we want to as long as they're in our own
country.''
   He said the Honduran army ``should pull on its pants and kick
out the Contras, who are threatening the territorial integrity of
Honduras.''
   About 10,000 anti-Sandinista rebels have been camped for nearly
two years in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border. Some reportedly
have been filtering back in to Nicaragua, where combat has
intensified in recent weeks.
   Ortega last month ended a truce with the Contras.
   ``Honduras has an army that is very valiant when it comes to
killing its own people, but not valiant enough to kick out the
Contras,'' said Ortega, using some of the region's most incendiary
language in months.
   A Salvadoran politician who has been a top-ranking diplomat said
the apparent victory of Rafael Callejas, a conservative, in
Honduras' presidential election Sunday further clouds a complicated
regional scene.
   ``There is great fear that a far-rightist axis will form between
Honduras and El Salvador and that the demobilization of the Contras
will not be brought off,'' said the diplomat, commenting on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the Honduran armed forces were particularly worried
about a victory by Callejas, who they view as less insistent on
demobilization and expulsion of the anti-Sandinista force.

   A couple who had been arguing about

herself once in the head. Her husband then picked up the gun an
shot himself in the head.
   Arcanio Joseph Rivera, 42, and Maria A. Rivera, 33, were dead on

   They had separated, said sheriff's Sgt. Wayne Burns. The man
lived at the mobile home where the shooting occurred. Burns did not
know where the woman lived.
   The couple's four children, whose ages ranged from 10 to 15,
also lived in the mobile home. Three sons saw the shootings, Burns
said. Their sister was visiting a friend.

<TEXT>
   Democrat L. Douglas Wilder was declared
elected governor Monday, but Republican J. Marshall Coleman asked
for a recount and an investigation of alleged irregularities in
Virginia's closest gubernatorial election.
   Coleman's announcement came about three hours before the State
Board of Elections reported that Wilder received 897,139 votes to
890,285 for Coleman out of nearly 1.8 million cast, for a margin of
6,854 votes, or .38 percent.
   Unofficial results had shown Wilder, the nation's first elected
black governor, ahead by 6,852 votes. State law allows for a
taxpayer-funded recount if the margin is less than half a percent.
   Coleman, a former state attorney general, said he would seek a
recount and ask the Democrat-controlled General Assembly to
investigate alleged election irregularities in the Nov. 7 balloting.
   In a notice to General Assembly leaders stating he intends to
contest the result, Coleman said voter registration lists used in
the election contained the names of people ineligible to vote.
   ``In an election as close as this one, irregularities which
would not ordinarily have a probable impact on the outcome assume a
greater importance,'' Coleman said in an accompanying letter.
   Coleman's attorney, William H. Hurd, declined to give details of
the allegations. ``There are a number of areas that we're looking
into,'' he said.
   Coleman had until Dec. 7 to request a recount but Monday was the
deadline for contesting the election because of alleged
irregularities.
   He said he would withdraw the challenge if the recount and other
information convinces him that the proceeding is ``no longer
necessary to safeguard the accuracy and integrity'' of the election.
   Democrats have no problem with Coleman's request for a recount,
but his contesting the election is ``a very cynical approach to
politics,'' said Virginia Democratic Chairman Lawrence H. Framme
III.
   ``The entire electoral process was marked by a high degree of
integrity,'' Framme said.
   Wilder, the state's lieutenant governor, said he would proceed
with plans for his administration that began just after he claimed
victory election night. He will be inaugurated Jan. 13.
   The recount will be overseen by a panel of three judges headed
by the chief judge of the Richmond Circuit Court. If Coleman
proceeds with contesting the election after the recount, the matter
would go before the privileges and elections committees of the
General Assembly, said state Sen. Stanley C. Walker, president pro
tempore of the Senate.
   Walker, who once won a contested election for his Senate seat,
said the proceeding would resemble a trial with both sides
presenting witnesses and evidence to the legislators. The
committees' recommendation would go to the full House and Senate.

<HEAD>Council of State Rules Islamic Scarves May be Worn in School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Council of State ruled Monday that Moslem girls
may wear Islamic scarves to school if it does not cause
disruptions, but the decision seemed unlikely to end the
controversy.
   The ruling by the council, France's highest administrative
authority, leaves it up to school authorities to judge on a
case-by-case basis whether the wearing of the ``hijab'' scarf
constitutes ``an act of pressure or provocation, of proselytism or
propaganda.''
   Education Minister Lionel Jospin had sought the ruling after
weeks of heated arguments.
   Wearing the hijab, which covers the hair, ears and neck, is not
incompatible ``with the principle of secularity in so far as it
constitutes the exercise of the freedom of expression'' and
religious belief, the council said.
   The principle of secularity in public schools has been the law
in France since the Roman Catholic church was officially separated
from the state in 1905. The latest controversy arose seven weeks
ago when three Moslem teen-agers in Creil, a town north of Paris,
refused to remove their scarves.
   The school principal, Ernest Chenieres, applied a 1937 law
prohibiting all religious symbols from school and denied the three
girls the right to attend class until they removed the scarves. The
girls refused and the issue became the center of a national debate.
   Similar cases arose in Marseille, Avignon, Montpellier and
Poissy and the arguments became linked to the issue of immigration,
particularly attitudes toward immigrants from Moslem countries of
North Africa.
   ``The Council of State has noted there can be no general and
absolute prohibition of the scarf,'' Jospin told reporters after
the ruling by the 90-member Council. He said he would circulate new
guidelines to schools.
   ``It is a debate that touches on freedoms so it should not be
regulated in a rigid way from on high,'' he said.
   Both conservatives and communists criticized the ruling.
   Saida Chella, a 17-year-old high school student in Avignon who
left school in October because the principal refused to allow her
to attend classes wearing a hijab, said: ``Starting tomorrow
morning, I will go to school ... with my scarf. The principal can't
refuse me that.''
   Alain Juppe, secretary-general of the conservative Rally for the
Republic opposition party, said the socialist government lacked the
courage to pass a new law clarifying the matter and was dumping the
problem back on the schools.
   ``If the law is not clear enough, it (the government) must
present Parliament with legislation that would clarify the
situation,'' he said.
   Andre Lajoinie, head of the communist group in the National
Assembly, said the government was ``backing away from the principle
of secularity.''
   Bruno Megret, No. 2 man in the extreme-right National Front that
has campaigned for years on an anti-immigration platform, said:
``The question being posed is not that of neutrality of schools,
but that of the colonization of France.''
   The National Education Federation, France's largest teachers'
union, said the council's ruling was ``a return to square one.''
   It said the ruling interpreted existing law, but teachers were
seeking precise regulations that would ``guarantee the secularity
of public service education.''

<HEAD>Bar Group Calls For Streamlined Death Penalty Appeals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Bar Association task force Monday
called for streamlining death-penalty appeals, but said even its
proposed changes would allow a convicted killer to fend off
execution for six years.
   The task force's lengthy report offered generally less severe
reforms than those proposed by a committee appointed by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist earlier this year.
   For example, the ABA task force recommendations would require
states to pay for qualified lawyers to represent death row inmates
for all their appeals.
   Civil liberties lawyers had denounced the Rehnquist-appointed
committee, led by retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell,
for failing to assure the competence of such lawyers.
   The ABA task force report said assuring qualified lawyers not
only ``assures fairness, but also avoids unnecessary delays in the
process.''
   The report recommends imposing a one-year deadline for someone
whose murder coviction has been upheld on direct appeal in state
courts to seek federal court help. Powell's committee has
recommended a six-month deadline.
   No such deadline exists now, and the average time between
someone being sentenced to death and actual execution is over eight
years.
   The ABA task force report has been sent to Congress, where it
joins the Powell committee report. The task force report will be
presented to the ABA's policy-making House of Delegates at its
February meeting.
   Ronald A. Klain, chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary
Committee, was quoted by The National Law Journal as saying he
expects the task force report to be ``a very, very seriously
considered document.''
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., already has
proposed legislation that adopts some of the Powell committee's
recommendations.
   There are more than 2,200 convicted murderers on death rows
across the nation, but only 119 executions have occurred since the
Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
   The task force said its year-long study was aimed at shortening
the total time for reviewing death-penalty cases, but noted that
``some reasonable amount of time is still indispensable for a
thorough consideration of the issues.''
   ``We should no longer see the aberrant case that is still in
litigation after nine or 10 years,'' the report said, (but) it
would be unrealistic to expect the ... review process will take
less than approximately six years'' if all available appeals are
pursued.

<TEXT>
   Intensified searching for the five crew members of
a lobster boat netted nothing Monday despite reports of three flare
sightings in 12 hours, officials said.
   At sea, 200 miles off Martha's Vineyard, five jets and two
cutters spent the day zeroing in on the 25-square-mile area of
rotary current where the flares had been pinpointed.
   Hope remained that the crew of the 72-foot Heidi Marie may be
alive and floating in relatively friendly Gulf Stream water.
   The steel-hulled lobster boat out of Stonington, Conn., and its
crew _ Mark Middleton, 33; and Ray Gould, Arthur Banks, Ray Morris
and Michel Hare, all in their 20s _ has been missing officially
since Wednesday. But officers at the Coast Guard's command post
began tracking distress signals for a week.
   On Friday, the day after a Thanksgiving Day storm raged through
the Northeast, rescuers turned up a floating radio beacon and
fishing markers bearing the Heidi Marie's name.
   Hopes dimmed over the weekend as searchers scoured tens of
thousands of miles under good conditions.
   ``We'd been looking for something the size of a Volkswagen in an
area the size of the state of New Hampshire,'' Lt. Paul Wolf said.
``We were getting to the point where we'd exhausted any chance of
finding anything on the surface of the ocean.''
   Then overnight Sunday and into Monday morning white flares were
sighted on three occasions, galvanizing searchers.
   Several fishermen at the docks on Connecticut shores refused to
talk about their friends. The dockmaster said only: ``Everyone here
is on edge, the families and the fishermen.''
   ``Safety is always on your mind,'' said Robert Cale, a
Stonington native who has recently gone back to lobstering. ``I've
lost cousins, a lot of people around here have lost relatives to
the sea.''

   And now, something completely different for
Michael Weisman: The Emmy-winning NBC Sports executive producer is
joining CBS' low-rated ``The Pat Sajak Show,'' sharing executive
producer duties with the star.
   The addition of Weisman to the late-night talk show was
announced Monday by CBS as the network's news division also
announced another change at ``CBS This Morning.'' That two-hour
show is third in ratings against NBC's top-rated ``Today'' show and
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   CBS's show, which last month got Erik Sorenson as its new
executive producer, said two new on-air reporters will join its
staff and film director Peter Bogdanovich, its movie-classic
critic, is leaving.
   The new reporters are Steve Kmetko, of CBS-owned KCBS-TV in Los
Angeles, who will report on the entertainment industry but continue
at KCBS, and Wayne Freedman, who will be a features reporter.
Freedman has worked for KRON-TV in San Francisco.
   Weisman has been with NBC Sports for 15 years and has won 10
Emmy awards. The show he is joining has struggled in the ratings
since its premiere Jan. 9. It began as a 90-minute program, but on
Oct. 30 was cut back to an hour.

   The Communist leaders of East Germany, who
were late and reluctant themselves in embracing change, said Monday
the Czechoslovak party is paying ``the bitter price'' of resisting
reform.
   Pressure for more rapid change at home continued. In Leipzig, a
center of the reform movement, 200,000 activists marched and a
rally speaker demanded a referendum on German reunification.
   Some demonstrators carried placards for German unity and the
issue dominated the weekly Leipzig rally for the second Monday in a
row.
   The East German leadership resists reunification, but has
mentioned as an alternative a vaguely phrased idea of confederation
with West Germany.
   Officials in Bonn, the West German capital, said Chancellor
Helmut Kohl had a plan that called for several intermediate steps
leading to reunification.
   They said he would present it to Parliament on Tuesday. ZDF said
Kohl planned to discuss the formula with President Bush by
telephone.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl might go to East
Germany for a summit Dec. 19, but would not decide until the
Communist Party congress scheduled to end two days earlier.
   In an interview with Bild, a mass-circulation newspaper in West
Germany, Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer of Dresden gave a gloomy
assessment of prospects for the East German party.
   ``The people have already taken our power away,'' Bild quoted
him as saying. ``The leading role of the Communist Party is already
history.''
   Berghofer has been mentioned as a possible challenger to party
chief Egon Krenz, who will seek re-election at the December
congress.
   Communist leaders criticized the 2.3 million-member Freie
Deutsche Jugend youth group for leaving the party, but reserved
their harshest comments for hard-liners in Prague.
   ``Undoubtedly, a storm is raging on the Vltava,'' the party
newspaper Berliner Zeitung said, referring to the river that runs
through the city. ``It is bringing the Czechoslovak Communist Party
the bitter price for the grave errors of the past.''
   It criticized the hard-liners for clinging to ``the heresy that
amid the radical reforms in economics, in the political sphere,
everything could stay as it was.'' The paper cited ``the illusory,
risky business of trying to choke the call for democracy with
police clubs ten days ago.''
   Freie Deutsche Jugend, the traditional stepping stone to success
for Krenz and other members of the leadership, announced Friday it
no longer wanted to be the ``helper and fighting reserve'' of the
party.
   The front-page editorial was the harshest East German criticism
of its Warsaw Pact ally to to date.
   East Germany stopped police repression of public protest in
early October, and reform ideas have gained momentum since.
   Berghofer, 46, is not a member of the Central Committee or
ruling Politburo, but has become prominent among reform-minded
Communists because of the way he handled unrest last month in
Dresden.
   He was quoted as telling Bild only ``two or three well known
names, or perhaps none'' will remain in the leadership after the
party congress and ``the Communists will become only one party
among many.''
   For 40 years, the Communists have claimed to get more than 99
percent of the votes in elections. Berghofer predicted the true
count in free elections would be less than 20 percent.
   Elections have been promised for late next year or early 1991.
   Democratic Awakening, an opposition group, said Monday it would
establish itself formally as a political party at a convention Dec.
16-17 in Leipzig. The party congress is schedled for Dec. 15-17 in
East Berlin.
   Democratic Awakening has about 10,000 members and is considered
more conservative than the largest opposition group, New Forum, to
which more than 200,000 people belong.

   Gunnar Hedlund, long-time leader of the
Swedish Center Party and former interior minister, has died at age
89.
   Hedlund died Sunday after a long illness. The cause of death was
not given but both the newspaper Aftonbladet and news agency TT
said it probably was heart failure.
   Hedlund was known for his quick wit, voiced in a heavy northern
accent.
   He entered parliament in 1942 representing the Farmer's Party,
and became party leader in 1949. Two years later he led his party
into a coalition government with the Social Democrats and took the
post of interior minister.
   In 1957, the Farmer's Party left the government, but Hedlund
remained popular. In his last election as leader in 1970, the
party, which had changed its name to the Swedish Center Party, won
almost 20 percent of the vote, making it the largest party in
opposition.
   After leaving politics, Hedlund made a second career as chairman
and manager of several forestry companies.

<HEAD>Rebels Attack Palace, Kill Comoro Republic's President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mutineers led by a former army
commander attacked the presidential palace in the Comoro Republic
and killed President Ahmed Abdallah Abderrahmane, longtime ruler of
the Indian Ocean island nation, officials said Monday.
   The rebel leader, former commandant Ahmed Mohamed, resigned
recently in a dispute with the 70-year-old president, an official
at the Comoro Embassy in Paris said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   He said the Sunday night assassination was not a coup and that
Mohamed was under arrest. The number of attackers was not divulged
and the official said he did not know if anyone else was seized.
   Abderrahmane was killed in a firefight between rebel soldiers of
the regular army and his 300-man presidential guard, state Radio
Comoro said. It said a guard officer also was killed.
   The head of the Supreme Court, Mohamed Djohar, took over as
leader of an interim government as dictated by the constitution,
the official said. The government declared a 40-day period of
mourning.
   Abderrahmane had survived coup attempts in 1983, 1985 and 1987.
His government denied reports of a coup attempt in 1981.
   The Sunday attack took place in the capital of Moroni, on the
main island of Grand Camore, home to half the nation's
predominantly Moslem population of 500,000. The Comoros, which lie
between Mozambique and Madagascar, were governed by Abderrahmane
for all but three years since 1972.
   The former French colony is among the world's poorest and least
developed nations, with an estimated annual per capita income of
$339. About 60 percent of the population is younger than 20.
   Abderrahmane will be buried Tuesday on his native island of
Anjouan, said Radio Comoro, monitored on the French-administered
island of Mayotte.
   The fighting apparently did not spill into the streets. Bruce
Thompson, manager of the Galewa Sun hotel, told the South African
Press Association by telephone everything was normal _ ``The town
is very quiet.''
   Three weeks ago, Abderrahmane won a referendum allowing him to
seek a third six-year term when his term expires next year.
Official results showed the measure passed with 92.5 percent of the
vote.
   The five opposition parties complained of voting irregularities
and opposition leaders in Paris said Abderrahmane jailed critics
shortly after the balloting.
   Abderrahmane, a Moslem was first elected president in 1972, when
the archipelago was still a French possession. The Comoros
unilaterally declared independence in July 1975 and Abderrahmane
became head of state.
   He was overthrown a month later by Ali Soilih, who said
Abderrahmane had amassed personal power in a dictatorial style, but
returned to power in 1978 in another coup led by French mercenary
Bob Denard.
   Denard, now 60, created the black-shirted presidential guard and
staffed it with European soldiers of fortune. He became a special
adviser to Abderrahmane, converted to Islam and settled in the
islands. It was not known Monday whether he played any role in the
latest episode.
   The presidential guard was better equipped and trained than the
700-man regular army and many Comorans came to see it as a device
to keep Abderrahmane in power.
   Abderrahmane resisted calls to reform his regime and accused
France, the former colonial power, of fomenting rebellion against
him.
   He had long been irked by France's refusal to cede control of
Mayotte to his government. The island decided in a 1975 referendum
to remain French.
   President F.W. De Klerk of South Africa sent a message of
condolence Monday addressed to the ``acting head of government''
condemning the assassination.
   South Africa is a major foreign investor in the republic. The
three islands of Grand Comore, Anjouan and Moheli cover 718 square
miles.
   The republic's main income is from tourism and the export of
perfume, copra, coconuts, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon.

<TEXT>
   Opposition groups narrowly won a
referendum Monday that postpones the presidential election and
gives them more time to organize against the ruling Communists, who
now call themselves the Socialist Party.
   According to preliminary results from the national electoral
board, 50.1 percent of those participating voted for the first
question on the ballot: ``Should the presidential elections be held
only after the parliamentary elections?''
   It was Hungary's first free election in more than four decades,
and the first since the Communists dissolved their party, renamed
it the Socialist Party and opened the way for free, multiparty
politics.
   A statement from the board said the four opposition groups
sponsoring the referendum won by only 6,618 votes. Official final
results were to be announced Tuesday.
   Of the 4,297,454 valid votes cast in the first referendum in
postwar Hungary, 2,152,036 favored the question and 2,145,418 were
opposed.
   Hours earlier, Imre Pozsgay, the Socialist Party presidential
candidate, acknowledged the opposition had won.
   The other three questions on the ballot were approved
overwhelmingly, said the electoral board statement carried by the
official news agency MTI.
   It said 95.1 percent of voters wanted the party out of the
workplace, 95.4 percent said the ruling party should reveal its
assets, and 94.9 percent favored disbanding the Workers' Militia, a
party army that already is melting away.
   Pozsgay told a news conference earlier Monday: ``While in
Eastern and Central Europe people by the hundreds of thousands are
marching in the streets to express their opinion, Hungarians are
going to the ballot box to express their political will.''
   Victory for the opposition means new democratic Parliament, to
be chosen by June, will elect the president. If voters had defeated
the referendum, they would have elected a president directly on
Jan. 7.
   Opposition groups said an election in January left them too
little time to organize a serious challenge to Pozsgay. They hope
to win strong representation in the new Parliament, which would
give their candidate a better chance at the presidency.
   Recent opinion polls indicate the Socialist Party will not win a
majority of the seats.
   Pal Kara, secretary of the referendum committee in Parliament,
said 58.2 percent of the 7.8 million eligible voters cast ballots.
   The opposition alliance has proposed that Parliament amend the
constitution to allow a popular election of the president after the
new Parliament is elected. It also proposed curtailing the
president's powers.
   Ivan Petoe, a leader of the Free Democrats, said the president
should not have the power to dissolve Parliament. Under the current
constitution, the president also is commander of the armed forces
and can call elections.
   Pozsgay, asked about the opposition proposal to hold direct
elections after the new Parliament is elected, said he was
``happy'' about it.
   He said he had no wish to be ``a fully weakened presidential
figurehead. ... That is different from my perception.'' Pozsgay
added, however, that he did not believe the head of state should
have ``arbitrary power.''
   If Parliament chooses the president, Pozsgay said, his chances
of getting the job will diminish ``because, in that case, the
position is subject to political bargaining.''

<HEAD>Storm Spreads Heavy Snow Over North-Central States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wintry storm marching across the continent hit the northern
Plains with up to 18 inches of snow Monday, and high wind, poor
visibility and icy roads combined to close schools.
   By afternoon, snow fell over much of the northern Plains region
and the upper Mississippi Valley, while rain extended from eastern
Nebraska into the upper Great Lakes region and northern sections of
the lower Ohio Valley.
   The storm had produced more than 3 feet of snow in California's
Sierra Nevada range on Saturday, and on Sunday dumped 10 to 20
inches of snow at many ski resorts in Colorado.
   Western South Dakota got the heaviest snow Monday with 18 inches
at Spearfish and Galena, both in the Black Hills.
   Northerly wind blowing at 20 to 50 mph in South Dakota reduced
visibility to near zero in blowing snow, and produced wind chill
readings calculated as low as 30 degrees below zero.
   Visibility was zero to one-fourth mile in parts of the northwest
and southwest corners of the state. Roads were snowpacked and
slippery throughout the northwest with light to heavy drifting in
many areas.
   Dozens of schools were closed across parts of South Dakota and
southeastern North Dakota.
   Cass County, N.D., Sheriff Donald Rudnick said it appeared most
people heeded warnings about dangerous travel conditions.
   ``That's one good thing, we haven't had a lot of stalled cars
because it looks like most people weren't out in it,'' Rudnick said.
   In Richland County, N.D., dispatcher Lori Kubitz reported a
number of vehicles were blown off icy roads. ``The wind is blowing
so hard that the plow trucks can't even spread any sand on the
roads,'' she said.
   Strong northerly wind, gusting to 50 mph, ushered cold arctic
air across the Plains, and sharply reduced visibility in blowing
dust across parts of Kansas, the National Weather Service said.
   Strong southerly wind ahead of an approaching cold front helping
temperatures in the middle Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio
Valley warm into the 50s and 60s, with some readings above 70
degrees.
   Peoria, Ill., hit a record 71; St. Louis, Mo., had a record 72;
and Springfield, Ill., had a record 72.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 8 degrees above zero at
McCall, Idaho.

   Eight people were injured in clashes between two
ethnic groups in the Soviet republic of Georgia during the past two
days, a local journalist reported Monday.
   An editor of the Georgian news agency Gruzinform, who refused to
identify himself, said ethnic Georgians and Ossetins fought near
Tskhinvali, about 60 miles northwest of the capital Tbilisi.
   Local police blocked roads to Tskhinvali and the city itself was
quiet, he said.
   He said informal Georgian groups planned to meet in Tskhinvali
last Saturday, but loaded buses and trucks blocked their way and no
meeting took place. The ethnic clashes broke out later, the editor
said, adding that the agency had no details on the planned rally or
on the cause of the clashes.
   The Ossetians are one of the many small ethnic groups populating
the Caucasus republic that has been a trouble spot this year.
   Clashes between the Georgians and Abkhazians have been
especially violent, but the Ossetians and the Meskhetian region
also felt tensions.

   Traffic accidents during the Thanksgiving holiday
weekend caused 398 deaths nationwide, just under the National

   The council had estimated that 400 to 500 motorists could be
killed on the nation's roads between 6 p.m. Wednesday and midnight
Sunday, local time.
   Last year, 438 traffic deaths were reported during the holiday
period.
   This year, California reported the highest toll with 59 deaths,

<TEXT>
   A U.S. health official called Monday for
federal regulation of all cholesterol screenings not conducted by
health care professionals, saying booths in shopping malls and
other public settings can be inaccurate and spread infections such
as AIDS and hepatitis.
   Richard Kusserow, inspector general at the Department of Health
and Human Services, said testers at these screenings frequently
disregard basic rules of hygiene in collecting blood samples and
often are poorly trained to operate the cholesterol-measuring
devices.
   ``I do not think it is conducive to good medical benefit to have
in this carnival-like atmosphere untrained people engaging in a
procedure which has some risk to public health from infection,'' he
told a House subcommittee.
   He added that people who are tested ``are going to try to depend
on these results, and the results, in fact, are not very accurate.''
   Kusserow said he is concerned that public cholesterol screenings
are growing in popularity and that they are often used by
entrepreneurs as a marketing strategy to promote products or by
stores to increase traffic.
   The inspector general said in an interview that his office is
conducting a criminal investigation into ``several scams'' in which
screeners unnecessarily refer Medicare and Medicaid recipients to
physicians for follow-up tests.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., chairman of the House Small Business
subcommittee on regulation and business opportunities, said the
scams involved screeners' rigging cholesterol-measuring devices so
they showed higher than true levels.
   Both declined to discuss the investigation further.
   The investigation grew out of a study conducted by the inspector
general's office at the request of Wyden as part of his panel's
continuing inquiry into unregulated medical testing.
   Kusserow's report, released at Monday's hearing, said demand for
screening is growing because of greater public awareness of the
link between high cholesterol and heart disease.
   Kusserow said he could not estimate accurately the number of
screenings that are conducted yearly at shopping malls, pharmacies,
health clubs, village halls and a variety of other public settings.
But he called it a ``growth industry'' and said at least 10 million
people were tested this way in 1988.
   The inspector general's investigators, who participated in 71
screenings as part of the study, often had a variety of health
concerns, including testers who collected blood, usually by a
finger prick, and also handled money but wore no gloves and did not
disinfect between collections, he said.
   Kusserow said these conditions raise the risk, both for testers
and those being tested, of infection from blood-borne diseases,
including AIDS and hepatitis.
   ``The likelihood is not that great,'' he said, adding that he
knew of no case in which disease has been spread through contact at
screenings. ``But I don't know if you want to be the 50th in line
that day'' when proper hygiene is not being followed, he said.
``You're just asking for trouble.''
   According to their findings, guidelines issued by the National
Cholesterol Education Program, a consortium of organizations
coordinated by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, were
usually not followed, he said.
   Often screenings held in crowded shopping centers or stores were
frenzied and 42 percent of them were staffed by just one person.
   Investigatores found that testers had little training and often
no medical background, he said. The portable analyzers used at
screenings are accurate when used properly, he added, but if not
calibrated or operated correctly, they often yield innacurate
results.
   Also, nearly 60 percent of the investigators whose blood was
drawn with a finger prick had their fingers squeezed or ``milked,''
which can dilute the sample with material from between the cells
and give a lower than true result.
   Dr. Russell Luepker of the University of Minnesota testified
that a study he conducted last year at several Minnesota screenings
found inaccurate results as high as 27 percent of the time at one
site. Most often, he said, the inaccurate result was lower than the
true level.
   Wyden said his concern was that people ``can be lulled into a
false sense of security. They may not see their doctors; they may
not change their diets, and they may not exercise. Over time, not
knowing that they're in the danger zone could cost us our health
and even our lives.''
   Kusserow's study did not measure the accuracy of testings, but
one of his investigators, Barbara Butz, who directed the project,
said she was tested five times, with the results ranging from 195
to 243 milligrams per deciliter. A reading of 200 is considered to
be the desirable level, 200-239 borderline high blood cholesterol
and over 240 a high level.
   Currently, no federal regulations govern public cholesterol
screenings and state regulation is scattered and varied. Kusserow
said 16 states have laws on their books, but that regulations in
four of them have not been implemented.
   A 1988 federal law brings all clinical laboratories under
federal regulation on Jan. 1, 1990. The Health Care Financing
Administration is drafting regulations to implement the law.
   The law, however, provides that some medical testing may be
exempt from its provisions. The inspector general recommended that
public screenings be included in the regulations because ``federal
regulation ... is clearly called for in order to safeguard the
public.''

<HEAD>British Editors Agree on Press Code</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editors of Britain's national newspapers said
Monday that in an attempt to ward off regulatory legislation, they
have agreed to a code of press behavior.
   Pressure has been building to rein in the more sensational
tabloids as concerns have risen about the invasion of privacy.
   In a joint declaration, the editors said they realized
newspapers needed to improve self-regulation.
   The code, to be published in each paper, calls for an appointed
ombudsman to police press behavior and safeguard standards of
accuracy and fairness.
   ``They will have the power to question journalists and editorial
executives. They will have the right to require prompt publication
of statements of correction and to have their findings published,''
the code said.
   It sets out rules requiring a justifiable public interest if
private lives are intruded upon, and a fair opportunity for reply.
   Mistakes must be corrected promptly and with appropriate
prominence.
   Newspapers will be barred from paying criminals for their
stories. The purchase of stories from figures in the news is common
in British journalism.
   The editors said they hope the declaration will stop moves in
Parliament to curb invasion of privacy. Editors said they believe
legislation could hamper access for journalists.
   On Nov. 20, publisher Robert Maxwell fired Wendy Henry, the
editor of his tabloid The People, for publishing photographs of
Princes William and Harry and of entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. that
he found not acceptable.
   The princes' parents, the Prince and Princess of Wales, objected
to the photos as intruding on the children's privacy and as a
security concern.

outskirts of Bogota shortly after takeoff Monday and all 107 people
aboard were killed. A caller to a radio station claimed drug
traffickers bombed the jet.
   Witnesses said the Avianca Airlines Boeing 727-100 exploded
before it plunged into a hilly area south of the capital, about a
mile from a neighborhood of slum houses and factories. Pieces of
the jet were found up to six miles from the main point of impact,
police said.
   Hours later, a man called Radio Caracol and claimed that a group
called The Extraditables blew up the jet to kill five police
informants. He said the five gave police information that led to
the discovery of the Medellin drug cartel leader's hideout.
   The man did not identify himself, and the claim could not be
immediately authenticated.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bogota said one U.S.
citizen, Andres Escabi, was known to have been killed in the crash.
He said Escabi, a native of Puerto Rico, also held Colombian
citizenship and lived in Bogota.
   ``The plane was flying along when suddenly it exploded, broke in
two and fell in flames and smoke,'' said a witness, Alfonso Moreno,
in an interview with the radio network Caracol.
   Flight 203 was bound for Cali, about 190 miles southwest of
Bogota. Cali is the headquarters of one of Colombia's biggest
cocaine cartels and has been the site of frequent bombings and
other attacks since the government declared war on drug lords in
August.
   ``I heard explosions and I thought there was some problem with
transformers in the electrical station, but I looked up and saw a
plane explode in the air, and bodies and pieces of luggage were
falling,'' said another witness, Mario Vasquez.
   Two Colombian air force pilots in another plane reported seeing
two explosions on the jet, said the director of Colombia's Civil
Aviation Authority, Col. Jorge Gonzalez.
   The airline refused comment on the reports of explosions.
Avianca spokeswoman Patricia Duarte said the plane carried 101
passengers and a crew of six and that all were killed. Their
nationalities were not immediately known.
   No one on the ground was hurt, spokesmen for Colombia's Civil
Defense teams said in radio interviews.
   Investigators found no evidence of a bomb, said Col. Gustavo
Leal, chief of national police for the state.
   Radio Caracol said the flight recorder was found and civil
aeronautics specialists were analyzing its data.
   The plane took off from Bogota's El Dorado International Airport
at 7:15 a.m., and the pilot, Jose Ossa, told the tower at 7:18 a.m.
that everything was normal, Ms. Duarte told The Associated Press.
It crashed shortly afterward.
   The pilot's wife, Cynthia Price Ossa, is from Baton Rouge, La.,
and lives in Bogota with the couple's four children.
   One witness said he saw black smoke pouring from one of the
plane's three engines and the plane then blew up.
   Most of the wreckage was in an area about 200 feet by 50 feet.
The biggest piece appeared to be about 50 feet long.
   Leal said one piece of the jet was found six miles away. The RCN
radio network said a body was found a half-mile from the main crash
site.
   Police at the crash site said 120 people had been arrested for
looting the bodies, suitcases, packages, and mail. Several of the
looters were caught removing rings and gold chains from the
corpses, police said.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco declared war on drug
traffickers in August, and since then there have been several
bombings and other attacks, but none on a large scale.
   The Extraditables is a shadowy group linked to the notorious
Medellin drug cartel. The group takes its name from the U.S.
Justice Department's list of 12 Colombian drug suspects most wanted
in the United States. The head of the Medellin cartel, Pablo
Escobar, tops the list.
   Last week, authorities raided a jungle hideout, and Escobar
reportedly came close to capture.
   The Seattle-based Boeing Co. said it was sending a team of
investigators to Colombia to help determine the cause of the crash.
   The last major passenger jet crash in Colombia occurred March
17, 1988, when an Avianca Boeing 727-100 crashed into a mountain
near the northern city of Zulia, killing 138 people.

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy will visit the scene
of one of his brother's most electric moments Tuesday and speak at
the site where President John F. Kennedy declared, in German: ``I
am a Berliner.''
   The Massachussetts Democrats is to lay a wreath in the late
president's memory at Schoeneberg City Hall in West Berlin, where
John F. Kennedy spoke to 400,000 people on June 26, 1963.
   ``All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of
Berlin,'' he told to the cheering crowd. ``And therefore, as a free
man, I take pride in the words, `Ich bin ein Berliner.'''
   Willy Brandt, who was at Kennedy's side in 1963 as mayor of West
Berlin and later served as West German chancellor, is to join the
senator at the ceremony.

   An Islamic fundamentalist group praised the
killing of Israeli soldiers and urged that more be ambushed in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The call for more attacks was in a leaflet distributed in the
West Bank by the fundamentalist group Hamas, or Zeal. It called for
a strike Dec. 9, as the third year of the uprising in the occupied
lands begins.
   Also Monday, Arab reports said a Palestinian shot and wounded in
the neck by Israeli troops during a clash in April died of his
injuries in Egypt.
   Bassam Arrada Al-Shaer, 21, of the town of Rafah in the Gaza
Strip, on the Egyptian border, died Sunday of respiratory
complications at El Salam Hospital.
   His death raised to 617 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the uprising. Forty-two Israelis have died, including
nine soldiers.
   At least 151 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs since
the rebellion began in December 1987, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel or for prostitution or drug dealing.
   The latest death came Monday, when a Palestinian man identified
as Mahmoud Abu al-Saoud, 22, died of wounds suffered five days
earlier when he was attacked by masked Palestinians armed with axes
in the West Bank town of Nablus, Arab reports said.
   They said he was accused of attempting to blackmail Palestinian
women with photographs and videotapes.
   A leaflet distributed Monday in Nablus by the PLO-backed Unified
Leadership of the Uprising urged an end to the internecine killings
and ordered groups operating outside the leadership's direction to
stop their activities.
   The leaflet called for ``stopping the campaign to kill those who
went astray'' and said all means must be used to convince people
cooperating with Israel to change their ways.
   The appeal followed weekend reports that groups of Palestinian
activists with assault rifles had begun patrols in Nablus to search
for suspected collaborators. Nablus has been the scene of 23 of the
collaborator killings, and most have been blamed on gangs operating
outside the leadership's control.
   In the Hamas leaflet, the group said it had mobilized ``several
thousand strugglers'' to step up the uprising.
   It praised the shooting deaths of two Israeli soldiers in
mid-November and the deaths of two others earlier this year and
called for ``the increased use of ambushes against Israeli soldiers
in the third year of the uprising.''
   Hamas has been outlawed by Israel, and more than 250 of its
leaders have been arrested, according to the army. Some are
awaiting trial on charges including involvement in the kidnapping
murders of the soldiers and other security offenses.
   Also Monday:
   _ Israeli soldiers rounded up more than 150 Palestinians for
questioning in the West Bank town of Bethlehem after empty bottles
were thrown at an army patrol, the army said. Four of those
questioned were detained.
   _ A pipe bomb exploded outside a bank in a shopping center in
the northern Israeli city of Haifa while police tried to dismantle
it. Two parked cars were damaged, but there were no injuries,
police said.
   _ Members of Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon shot to
death two men during a prison riot by inmates demandin to be
included in a proposed exchange with Israel, military sources said.
Reports from Lebanon said a Palestinian group, not identified, had
offered to trade the body of an Israeli soldier for Arab prisoners.

   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy departed for Berlin on
Monday to tour the newly opened Berlin Wall and cross into East
Germany 26 years after his brother's historic ``Ich bin ein
Berliner'' speech.
   Kennedy, the first high-ranking U.S. official to plan a visit to
the wall since East Germans were allowed to stream through to the
West, was to meet Tuesday with former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
   It was Brandt who, as mayor of West Berlin, greeted President
John F. Kennedy on June 26, 1963, the day Kennedy spoke to a throng
blocks from the wall dividing East from West.
   ``I think all of us have watched in awe in recent weeks as a new
spirit of freedom has swept throughout Eastern Europe and nowhere
is this spirit greater than in Berlin,'' Kennedy said in an
interview before catching his flight at Logan International Airport.
   The senator said he was going to pay tribute not only to his
brother's visit in 1963 but ``to the spirit of the people who have
kept the spirit alive.''
   Sen. Kennedy planned no major address in Berlin but was
scheduled to deliver remarks at a memorial to his brother at the
Berlin City Hall.
   ``He's going for personal, not political reasons,'' said Kennedy
spokesman Paul Donovan.
   After a visit to the Brandenburg Gate and a visit at a memorial
to those killed trying to cross over the wall, Kennedy planned to
cross into East Berlin at Checkpoint Charlie, most famous of the
once heavily guarded border crossing points. Donovan said Kennedy
planned to hold private meetings with East German officials.
   Kennedy, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is
also visiting Geneva and Brussels for meetings on defense-related
matters.
   John Kennedy's speech, two years after construction of the wall,
reaffirmed the support of the West for citizens of the blockaded
city. It ended with the declaration that in the free world it was a
symbol of honor to declare ``I am a Berliner.''
   Kennedy's speech was seen as a high point in his presidency and
as a touchstone of the Cold War for its clear delineation of the
difference in personal liberties between East and West.

   Onetime Tennessee financial wizard Jake
Butcher and a close associate pleaded guilty Monday to two counts
of a federal indictment accusing them of defrauding an Orlando bank
of $3.9 million.
   The plea-bargain agreements in the complex case were entered
before U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp shortly before the two
men were to have gone on trial.
   Butcher, who until 1983 headed a financial empire of 28 banks in
Tennessee and Kentucky, is serving a 20-year prison term for bank
fraud. He lost a race for Tennessee governor in 1978 and was the
chief organizer of the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville.
   Also pleading guilty was Earl D. Wilson, who worked for Butcher
at the time the banks failed and is serving a 10-year sentence for
bank fraud.
   Butcher's attorney, Edward Garland of Atlanta, said related
conspiracy charges against his client would be dropped.
   The 89-page indictment alleged that Butcher and Wilson
orchestrated a scheme to obtain fraudulent loans from Florida
Center Bank in Orlando in 1984-85 using a series of ``straw
borrowers'' who would funnel the money to them.
   Butcher and Wilson could not obtain loans under their own names
because they had filed for bankruptcy and were either under
investigation or charged with bank fraud in Kentucky and Tennessee,
the government alleged.
   The grand jury charged that Butcher and the Wilsons paid former
bank president Joe F. Justice to make the loans. Justice, who was
not charged, is serving a 10-year sentence on similar charges in
another case.
   Florida Center Bank collapsed in 1986.
   Butcher faces a maximum term of seven years and a fine of up to
$500,000 on the two counts. Wilson faces a possible 10 years and a
fine of $500,000.
   Prosecutors will recommend that Butcher's time be served
concurrently with the sentence he is already serving in a prison in
Atlanta, Garland said.
   Butcher had faced a maximum sentence of 71 years in prison and
up to $4.5 million in fines if convicted in the Orlando case,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ricardo Pesquera said.
   Pesquera would not elaborate on the plea-bargain arrangements
because he was prosecuting four other people in the same case, but
suggested he did not expect to call Butcher and Wilson to testify.
   Also pleading guilty to two counts in the 51-count indictment
issued in Orlando last August was Wilson's wife, Harriette, and
David Ogle and Allen Hicks, both of Knoxville, Tenn. Frederick C.
Streck of Atlanta, Ga. and Michael R. Allen of Altamonte Springs,
Fla., pleaded guilty to one count.
   The other defendants in the case generally served as fraudulent
borrowers, Pesquera told the jury in the case against the remaining
defendants, Harold and Margaret Artrip of Longwood, and James P.
Gresham and Sandra K. Chitwood of Atlanta.
   ``It was all part of the scheme and pattern,'' he said, asking
the jury to ``look at it as a jigsaw puzzle'' with all the pieces
fitting together as part of a plan to cheat the bank.
   Lawyers for Gresham, the Artrips and Ms. Chitwood argued that
all of the loans they obtained were legal and repaid to the bank
with interest.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Law School to Provide Notes for Deaf Student</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday ordered a state
law school to provide notes for a deaf student who charged in a
lawsuit that the school failed to provide adequate classroom
assistance.
   The temporary restraining order barred Rutgers University School
of Law from holding two classes attended by Karen Prince unless she
receives transcribed notes within 24 hours of each class.
   ``I've got to satisfy that she gets that information,'' said
U.S. District Judge Stanley S. Brotman. ``It may cost Rutgers some
money, but that's my least concern now.''
   Ms. Prince, 39, a third-year law student who represented
herself, sued to be provided with an adequate note-taker or
interpreter.
   ``It's all I wanted _ a note-taker,'' Ms. Prince said tearfully
after the judge's ruling. ``I'm very satisfied.''
   Ms. Prince, who expects to graduate in December, said the case
marks the first time federal civil rights provisions have been used
to force a university to supply assistance for a deaf student. She
lost her hearing in 1972.
   She is the only deaf student attending the 700-student law
school, school officials said.
   The university has spent about $10,000 a year to provide sign
language translators and note-takers for Ms. Prince, said Aron
Schwartz, the university's attorney.
   However, he said the school has had a difficult time finding
qualified candidates.
   Ms. Price, who began taking classes at the school's Camden
campus in August 1986, said the school agreed to provide
note-takers and interpreters for every class.
   But in June 1987, Ms. Prince filed a civil rights claim against
the university, contending that it failed to provide the assistance
she needed.
   In a February 1988 settlement, the school agreed to provide
aides, but Ms. Prince sued again Nov. 12, charging that the school
had reneged.
   Ms. Prince said she has been attending a course in advanced
constitutional law without a note-taker or an interpreter.
   For a course in international organizations, she was provided
with a note-taker three weeks after the semester began. But the
notes were illegible and she refused to accept them.
   Fall semester classes are scheduled to end on Friday.

<TEXT>
   Detroit's two daily newspapers, the nation's
ninth- and tenth-largest papers, launched their long-stalled
partial merger Monday, as union and management officials resumed
contract talks.
   ``I think the feeling is, we are close. I'm optimistic we can
reach an agreement,'' Detroit Free Press Publisher Robert Hall said.
   Robert Giles, publisher of The Detroit News, said he also
expected to reach an agreement with five of the newspapers' six
unions by a 12:01 a.m. Thursday strike deadline. The press
operators' Graphics Communications International Union ratified a
contract Sunday.
   William Keating, chief executive of the Detroit Newspaper
Agency, which runs the combined operations, said Monday night talks
would continue until the two sides agree.
   ``I am totally convinced that everything will be resolved and
that there will not be a strike,'' Keating said.
   The main issue was money. Louis Mleczko, president of Local 22
of the Newspaper Guild, said management negotiators offered a
$30-per-week raise during the first year of a 2{-year contract, $30
in the second year, $15 for the remaining six months, and a signing
bonus equal to two weeks' pay for the approximately 3,300 employees
at the papers.
   The unions seek raises totaling $110 weekly during the 2{-year
contract plus a three-week pay bonus, said Mleczko. The average
salary of all workers at the two newspapers, excluding benefits, is
about $570 weekly, Hall said.
   Many newspaper employees have had only one raise since 1986,
when News owner Gannett Co. Inc. and Free Press owner Knight-Ridder
Inc. announced plans to pursue the joint operating agreement, under
which business operations are merged while editorial departments
remain separate.
   With the JOA in place, the Free Press remains a morning
newspaper while the News will generally have afternoon home
deliveries. There will be joint weekend editions, under the
masthead of The Detroit News and Free Press.
   According to figures released Nov. 13, the daily circulation of
the News is 690,422 and 832,382 on Sundays, and the Free Press' is
626,434 daily and 687,537 Sundays.
   The JOA's path was cleared, after years of legal challenges from
a coalition of readers and advertisers, when the U.S. Supreme Court
tied 4-4 on Nov. 13 after hearing an appeal. The tie let stand
lower court rulings that approved the 100-year agreement.
   The Free Press, which lost millions of dollars in the past 10
years, was described as in danger of failing without the JOA.

   A 53-man British trade mission
began a week of meetings Monday to explore the possibility of
resuming commercial relations interrupted by the Falkland Islands
war of 1982.
   The mission, sponsored by the Latin American Trade Advisory
Group and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is ``the
first contact toward re-establishment of trade relations with a
traditional partner of Britain,'' said Lord Montgomery, leader of
the group.
   He and the delegation met with Oscar Saggese, secretary of
industry and foreign trade and attended a luncheon with the
Argentine Chamber of Commerce.
   Britain's embassy has been closed since the 74-day war in 1982
for the South Atlantic archipelago, which Argentina started and
Britain won.
   Formal talks aimed at restoring relations without resolving the
issue of sovereignty over the islands, which both nations claim,
began earlier this year in New York and Madrid. Further meetings
are scheduled next month in Montevideo, Uruguay, and next year in
Paris.
   The trade delegation is to meet President Carlos Menem on
Thursday and will consult with ``representatives of business, banks
and state organisms scheduled for privatization,'' Montgomery said.
   He said the mission would ``evaluate current political
conditions to see if they are favorable for future capital
investments in areas such as petrochemicals, petroleum and
agriculture.''
   Saggese said the British delegates suggested Argentine
businessmen return the visit next year. He said trade between the
two countries, about $850 million in 1981, now amounts to $100
million a year, largely conducted through third countries.

<TEXT>
   The ho-ho's of a shopping mall Santa Claus
turned into uh-oh's over the weekend.
   Officials at Tysons Corner Center in suburban Virginia were
shocked to discover that their jolly old elf was handing out to
tots copies of a children's book containing the startling message
that there's really no Santa.
   There, on page 86 of ``A Pee Wee Christmas,'' fresh from St.
Nick's very own toy sack, was the revelation by one of the book's
characters that Santa Claus is a fake, just like his paste-on beard
and padded stomach.
   The books were yanked Saturday and replaced with Christmas
stickers and fingerprinting kits, but not before copies of ``A Pee
Wee Christmas'' had been dispensed to 300 or 400 innocent tots who
had climbed onto Santa's lap in the previous week.
   The mall was alerted by a complaint from Linda Smyth, a nurse
from nearby Vienna, Va., who had taken her 4-year-old son, Logan,
to meet Santa.
   ``I read the story to Logan at bedtime,'' she said, ``and he
fell asleep before I got to the juicy part, fortunately.''
   Said Tysons Corner general manager Jim Foster: ``What can I say?
We screwed up.''
   Foster said mall officials had screened more than a dozen books
looking for an appropriate Santa gift, but ``we just flat missed''
the troublesome passage in their final selection.
   The book tells the tale of a 7-year-old named Sonny who is
ridiculed by his friends for saying he believes in Santa Claus. His
friend Molly decides to set him straight.
   Here is the ``juicy part'' that raised Mrs. Smyth's eyebrows:
   ``Sonny,'' she whispered bravely. ``There isn't any real Santa
Claus. Your mom gives you the things on your list. I used to
believe in him too. But when you're seven you should know.''
   ``I know that,'' said Sonny. ``I knew he wasn't real. I saw his
beard. It was just pasted on.''
   Sonny adds that he was just pretending because ``it's more fun
to believe.''
   The book, part of a ``Pee Wee Scouts'' series that has sold more
than 2 million copies, was written by children's author Judy Delton
of St. Paul, Minn.
   In a telephone interview Monday, she said her Christmas story
had received very few complaints.
   Ms. Delton said ``A Pee Wee Christmas'' was written for 7- and
8-year-olds, who already have learned about Santa Claus from
television and playground gossip, but was never meant for younger
children.
   Nevertheless, she said, ``I was terribly sorry'' when she heard
about the flap over her book at the Tysons Corner mall.
   ``I felt really bad about it, and I can only apologize,'' she
said.
   Mrs. Smyth said she's glad Logan fell asleep while she was
reading ``A Pee Wee Christmas,'' and hopes her son continues to
believe in Santa Claus for many more years.
   ``That's the magic of being a child,'' she said. ``I know one
day he'll find out, but I don't want it to be like that.''
   Foster expressed chagrin over the incident, and offered this
word of advice: ``Don't believe everything you read.''

   Two Soviet soldiers held for more than
two years by Afghan anti-communist rebels were released to their
mothers in an emotional ceremony Monday in the Pakistani frontier
city of Peshawar, near Afghanistan.
   Soviet Ambassador Victor Yakunin said that a reciprocal release
of 33 prisoners, most of them captured Afghan rebel fighters, will
take place this week in Kabul, the Afghan capital.
   Army privates Andrei Lopukh and Valery Prokapchuk, both 20 and
clad in white, hugged their mothers and wept with them as they were
reunited at the fortress-like headquarters of the rebels'
self-styled governmment-in-exile.
   ``I'm very happy that I just saw my son and I know that he's
coming home,'' said a tearful Valentina Prokapchuk.
   Dozens of mujahedeen, or Islamic ``holy warriors,'' toting
Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifles stood guard in their gray dress
uniforms as Pakistan police formed a security ring around the
headquarters.
   Yakunin; Sayed Gailani, acting president of the so-called
interim government; and representatives of Pakistan's Foreign
Ministry and the International Committee of the Red Cross attended
the ceremony.
   ``A reciprocating gesture of good will will take place in Kabul
in a couple of days,'' Yakunin said. ``This is a good beginning.''
   He called it a ``high act of humanitarianism.''
   The ambassador said that besides rebel fighters, the Kabul
release will include Pakistanis and citizens of sympathetic Arab
states captured while fighting inside Afghanistan alongside Afghan
insurgents.
   Before freeing the two Soviets, the rebels lectured the
prisoners' mothers, who were part of a seven-member private
delegation from the Soviet Union.
   ``I understand that not only these women are weeping today,
there are probably many more weeping in the Soviet Union,'' said
Farooq Azam, an official of the mujahedeen government.
   ``But let me remind you that thousands of Afghan mothers are
crying over the loss of their children.''
   Gailani called the release ``ample proof of our good
intentions.''
   ``Though the war is not yet over we are releasing two more
Soviet prisoners to show our humane motives ... in spite of the
fact that thousands of our people are held by the Kabul regime and
the Soviet Union as prisoners.''
   Rebel fighters have intermittently exchanged Soviet prisoners
during the 11-year-old insurrection in Afghanistan.
   ``The puppet regime, and its supporter, should realize the
plight of our nation and should leave in grace and thus stop
further bloodshed, before they are terminated by the wrath of our
people,'' Gailani said.
   Iona Andronov, spokesman of Nadezhka (Hope), a private group
which works for the release of Soviet POWs, thanked the mujahedeen
leaders and apologized for what he termed ``this bloody war and
stupid war, which was started by the politicians and generals.''
   In December 1979, the Kremlin ordered more than 100,000 combat
troops into Afghanistan to oversee the replacement of one Marxist
government in Kabul with another and to help fight a growing Moslem
insurgency.
   The Soviet troop withdrawal was completed last February, in line
with a United Nations-brokered accord.

   Two bombs exploded Monday night
at the newly privatized Short Brothers aircraft factory, badly
damaging one plane but causing no injuries, police said.
   The Press Association news agency said the outlawed Irish
Republican Army claimed responsibility. Police said a woman caller
telephoned a warning 20 minutes before the explosions and said
there were five bombs.
   One bomb damaged a Shorts 330 light aircraft and a second
exploded at an entrance gate, police said. Three more bombs were
defused.
   In July, the IRA planted five bombs that damaged two aircraft at
Shorts. It said the action was to protest alleged discrimination
against Roman Catholics and because the company did work for
Britain's Defense Ministry.
   The IRA wants to drive Britain from the Protestant-dominated
province and unite it with the Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Millions of people ignored
government pleas and joined a nationwide general strike Monday in
the largest and most dramatic demonstration so far for democracy
and an end to Communist Party rule.
   ``We don't want you anymore!'' a flag-waving crowd of 200,000
roared in a thunderous chant that echoed off the 19th-century
buildings surrounding downtown Wenceslas Square. It was the 11th
straight day of massive protests in Czechoslovakia.
   Huge crowds of workers also poured into the streets of
Bratislava, the east Slovak industrial center of Kosice, the mining
center of Ostrava on the Polish border, and in Usti nad Labem, the
heart of industrial north Bohemia.
   The showing was a resounding victory for the opposition, which
had called the two-hour strike a referendum on the Communists'
40-year monopoly on power.
   Communist leaders' frantic attempts to avert the strike failed,
as workers joined the pro-democracy movement started by students,
artists and intellectuals.
   Shaken leaders continued to make new concessions to the
opposition:
   _ The party's Central Committee dumped three more hard-liners
from the ruling Politburo, the second major leadership reshuffle in
three days.
   _ The Czech and Slovak ministries of culture announced they had
lifted most forms of press censorship.
   _ The Central Committee approved an inquiry by a parliamentary
commission into a Nov. 17 rally in which riot police clubbed
hundreds of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators.
   _ Deputy premier Jaromir Zak said on state TV that after long
discussion, it was decided to drop the article enshrining the
leading role of the Communists in the constitution from a new draft
of the document. ``Every political party has the right to a leading
role as long as it is based on results,'' he said. ``It's not
possible to lay this down in the constitution.''
   _ The official CTK news agency said parliament, until now a
rubber-stamp body under firm Communist control, also would be open
to discussion of any draft laws. Vladimir Janku, head of the
state's commission on church affairs, was quoted as saying these
would include new laws on religion that would end state control
over churches and the criticized practice of licensing priests.
   But there were still more conditions to be met. Posters
demanding free elections and an end to one-party rule were
plastered over the windows of shops, hotels and restaurants that
closed to observe the strike.
   At Prague's largest industrial complex, CKD, workers demanded
the formation of independent trade unions.
   Hundreds of thousands of joyous workers streamed into the city's
center, carrying banners of their factories, firms and offices in
an outpouring of national pride and support for democratic reforms.
Sirens howled and church bells pealed as the strike began at noon.
   ``Look Gustav, how thick the crowd is!'' the people chanted,
referring to President Gustav Husak, the man who headed the
crackdown on democratic reforms after a Warsaw Pact invasion in
1968.
   ``Dubcek to the Castle!'' they yelled, referring to Alexander
Dubcek, the ousted leader of the failed ``Prague Spring'' reforms
who was replaced as party leader by Husak. Hradcany Castle, a
national symbol, is the presidential residence.
   ``It has to go to the very end,'' said Jana Cervenkova, who was
among the demonstrators. ``As long as the Communists rule, it's
going to be messed up as it was for the last 40 years.''
   More than 200,000 people attended another mass rally in Prague
Monday afternoon, continuing the series of protests that have
yielded major government concessions to opposition demands.
   Vaclav Klaus, a spokesman for the opposition group Civic Forum,
called off any rallies for Tuesday, when the opposition meets the
government for more negotiations. Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec
on Sunday held an unprecedented meeting with opposition leaders to
try to contain the peaceful revolt.
   ``Demands of the Civic Forum have been met in principle or are
being met,'' Klaus said. But he warned that the rallies would
resume if negotiators fail to make progress toward democratic
reforms.
   ``The fundamental condition in our talks is the holding of free
elections,'' Klaus told the crowd.
   Valtr Komarek, the head of the Forecasting Institute of the
Academy of Sciences, branded the current orthodox Communist system
``a message from the valley of shadows.''
   Actors and students groups in Prague and Bratislava, capital of
Slovakia, have proposed that Komarek be named premier.
   State TV, which has played a key role in the dizzyingly rapid
popular revolt, broadcast footage from industrial centers around
the country, showing crowds of hundreds of thousands attending
strike rallies.
   State radio said all enterprises were affected by the strike,
although most had skeleton crews on duty so that production would
not be halted completely.
   In Bratislava, dissident Milan Simecka read a message from
Vaclav Havel, the nation's most prominent opposition leader, who
said ``have no fear, the future is ours.''
   When a speaker at the rally mentioned Dubcek, the crowd of
100,000 people responded with a deafening roar.
   Dubcek has made a dramatic political comeback after two decades
of political exile, addressing huge crowds four days running in
Prague and his native Bratislava.
   In another development, exiled actor Pavel Landovsky and writer
Pavel Kohout were allowed into the country for the first time in
more than 10 years and addressed the people gathered in downtown
Bratislava.
   In Plzen, about 60 miles southwest of Prague, workers at the
gigantic Skoda heavy machinery works ignored management appeals to
remain on plant property and joined a crowd of demonstrators
downtown, state radio reported.

<HEAD>Connecticut Woman Accused of Arms Cache in El Salvador</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THOMASTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jennifer J. Casolo, accused by
Salvadoran authorities of maintaining a cache of ammunitition and
explosives, was defended Monday by her mother and friends in
Connecticut as a peaceful church worker.
   In Washington, meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``There's not much doubt that the material was there ... I
don't know about her role.''
   Casolo, 28, a translator and tour coordinator for an ecumenical
group based in San Antonio, Texas, was arrested Sunday after a
predawn raid by Salvadoran police on her San Salvador home.
   Maj. Mauricio Chavez Caceres, a Salvadoran armed forces
spokesman, said 40,000 rounds of ammunition for U.S.-made M-16
rifles, 40,000 rounds of ammunition for Soviet-designed AK-47
rifles, 203 blocks of TNT and 403 detonator caps were found in
Casolo's house and at other locations.
   Chavez said the arms cache ``proves church involvement'' with
the Salvadoran rebels, known as the FMLN. He did not elaborate.
   ``It's fairly clear that these weapons were found there,''
Fitzwater said Monday. ``I mean, we're not talking about a small
package of pistols here. We're talking about tons of equipment and
mortars and dynamite and rounds of ammunitions and explosives. This
is hardly a case of someone having a few things flipped in their
shopping bag on the way home.''
   John Blatz, a spokesman for the group Casolo worked for,
Christian Educational Seminar, called the accusations against
Casolo ``ridiculous'' and ``part of their (the government's)
persecution of the churches. That's clear.''
   Casolo's mother, Audrey Casolo, also rejected the charges.
   ``Jennifer is working for the church,'' Mrs. Casolo said. ``She
is working to help the poor people.''
   Since her 1983 graduation from Brandeis University, Casolo has
worked at a soup kitchen in Chicago and taught English to refugees
in Maryland. In 1984, she went to a village in the Dominican
Republic, where she taught adults.
   Four years ago she went to El Salvador to organize tours for
delegations from the United States and Canada, said Susan Abbott, a
friend from Thomaston High School.
   ``She would take them around,'' she said. ``They would see
government officials. They would go to refugee camps, the
cooperatives they had down there. From the left to the right, she
tried to give the delegations a real feel for what was going on in
El Salvador.''
   Another friend of Casolo's from New Haven who once worked with
her in El Salvador said she suspects the ammunition was planted in
Casolo's garden by agents of the Salvadoran government.
   ``They're trying to frame her to justify the actions taken by
the military against international church workers in the last two
weeks,'' Ann Lutterman said.
   Lutterman now works for the Committee in Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador in New Haven. The group was founded in 1981
to oppose U.S. policies in Central America, including U.S. support
of the Salvadoran government.
   Security forces have raided more than a dozen churches and
refugee centers since rebels launched an offensive on the capital
Nov. 11. Last week, six Jesuit priests were killed at their
dormitory on a university campus in the capital. Human rights
organizations say circumstantial evidence points to the Salvadoran
military as the priests' killers.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reaffirmed Monday
she will stay in office as long as she is wanted and said reports
she will step down soon after the next election ``could not have
been further from the truth.'' On her objection to European
Economic Community evolution toward a United States of Europe, Mrs.
Thatcher said Parliament would not allow Britain's monetary,
budgetary and economic policy to be left to the 12 member countries.
   ``I believe Britain is right,'' she said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. TV interview. `` We are choosing between the
British parliament and a group of people who are not accountable. I
believe our views will prevail as people look at it.''
   The EEC would ``go far further and have far better results if we
cooperate as 12 sovereign nations, voluntarily cooperating on the
things we do best,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 64, has swept the Conservatives to three
successive election victories and is the longest-serving British
prime minister this century.
   ``I shall stay as long as the electorate and my own party wish
me to do, not a moment longer, but I hope as long as that,'' she
said Monday, adding she is fit and loves her work.
   She expressed concern about the effect of next week's
Conservative Party leadership election, saying, ``I think at the
moment, uncertainty about anything connected with the government is
not good _ but I would not like to use that to hinder anyone who
wants to stand.''
   The Conservatives have routinely endorsed her leadership since
1975. This year she faces a challenge from 69-year-old Sir Anthony
Meyer, a rank-and-file legislator.
   Voting is scheduled for Dec. 5. Under Tory rules, she must get
57 percent of the votes to win outright. If she does not, some more
prominent candidate than Meyer would be expected to enter the race
in a second ballot.

<HEAD>Amtrak Trial Over Sewage Dumping Begins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALATKA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Amtrak told a jury Monday
that a federal law exempts the passenger rail service from being
prosecuted for dumping sewage into public waterways from train
bridges.
   The case marks the first time Amtrak has gone to court on
criminal charges, although several Western states have criticized
its habit of flushing toilets along its right-of-way.
   Mary and William Trammel testified Monday that they were sprayed
by a dark, watery substance from an Amtrak train as they fished
below a trestle over the St. Johns River.
   Attorneys for Amtrak said the rail service never intended to
violate a Florida law that bans dumping sewage into public
waterways. But even if the law was broken, attorneys said, federal
law exempts Amtrak from prosecution.
   A 1972 federal law allows Amtrak to dispose of waste by dumping
it along its right-of-way because Congress found the company could
not comply with a federal health study prohibiting the practice,
attorney Edward Booth said.
   However, Assistant State Attorney Dennis Bayer told jurors that
the Florida law does count.
   The charges stem from incidents in November and December 1988
and May 1989. Bayer said Amtrak in those months allegedly dumped
human waste into the St. Johns River and Rice Creek as trains
crossed bridges.
   Amtrak is on trial on four counts of commercial littering and
one count of causing a nuisance. The littering charges are felonies
under Florida law.
   Although the statute calls for fines and jail times, the state
is merely seeking to have the practice stopped, prosecutors have
said.
   The railroad has threatened to suspend service to Florida, where
it carries about 1 million passengers a year, if the state
continues to press its case.
   Amtrak officials have said it would be too costly to put holding
tanks on its existing trains, although it hopes eventually to
replace much of its fleet with new cars that would have holding
tanks for all toilets.
   The case is expected to go to the jury Wednesday.

   This farming community's hunt for a missing
18-year-old honors student ended Monday when searchers found her
body in the shallow Nooksack River.
   The body was identified as that of Amanda Stavik, Whatcom County
Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Peterson told a news conference.
   Stavik had been missing since she went jogging Friday with her
dog, Kyra, while home from college on Thanksgiving break. The dog
returned alone.
   Authorities believe Miss Stavik was abducted, said Peterson, who
would not comment on the body's condition or how Miss Stavik died.
An autopsy will be conducted, he said.
   There was no evidence of a struggle on the bank near where the
body was found, leading authorities to suspect it floated
downstream, the sergeant said. He said detectives were still
looking for clues.
   There were no suspects in the case, Peterson said.
   Until Monday, authorities had seized upon a pair of teal blue
sweatpants recovered in the area as their only potential clue. Miss
Stavik was wearing that color garment when she was last seen.
   Whatcom County officials had asked the FBI for help and planned
to enlist the aid of the Green River Task Force, a Seattle-based
team of detectives with expertise in abduction that was formed to
pursue a serial killer.
   The FBI helped interview classmates of Miss Stavik at Central
Washington University in Ellensburg.
   The sweatpants were discovered 10 miles from the Stavik family's
home in this town of 250 people in northwestern Washington state,
80 miles north of Seattle and 20 miles south of the Canadian border.
   ``You think of those things happening in Seattle but not here,''
LoBay Smith said from behind the cash register at Acme Foods, where
customers had pledged $7,000 to anyone finding ``Mandy,'' as Miss
Stavik was known.
   Many of the Staviks' neighbors had joined the search in the
evergreen-studded foothills and along Highway 9, a busy road
connecting Seattle and its suburbs with the Mount Baker ski area.
   Miss Stavik's mother, Mary, had worked to keep her mind from
dwelling on her missing daughter.
   ``She was very happy and positive and feeling good about
school,'' Ms. Stavik said Sunday. She said her daughter had brought
a Japanese exchange student home for the holiday.
   Miss Stavik was last seen about a half-mile from her home by her
younger brother, Lee, 13. Her mother thought she had jogged the
three miles to the south fork of the Nooksack River.
   Lee, who was visiting a neighbor at the time, said it looked
like his sister was on her way back from the river.
   The sweatpants, recovered near an unpaved road where garbage is
sometimes dumped, did not prove to be solid evidence.
   Although they are the same color as sweatpants Miss Stavik was
wearing when last seen, bloodhounds failed to identify the garment
as Miss Stavik's, and her mother couldn't be certain they were her
daughter's.
   Detectives said their best leads may come from passers-by who
might have noticed something suspicious along the highway. The road
has about four times the traffic as normal because of a washed-out
bridge and the opening of ski season at Mount Baker, said
Undersheriff Doug Gill.
   ``We're hoping somebody saw something and will give us a call,''
he said.
   Investigators also have pulled the parole records of sexual
predators or other criminals who were known to be in the area, said
Gill.

<HEAD>Nearly Six Tons of Cocaine Seized _ Biggest Bust Ever in Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents seized nearly six tons of
cocaine in Mexico's largest cocaine bust and killed six drug
traffickers in the operation, Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del
Castillo said Monday.
   He said the cocaine was linked to Colombia's Medellin cartel and
the traffickers were trying to smuggle the drugs overland to the
United States.
   Alvarez del Castillo, seated beside thousands of packets
containing tons of cocaine, called last week's operation ``the
biggest cocaine bust in the history of our country.''
   He said a half-dozen traffickers were killed, two federal police
were wounded and five suspects were captured during a gun battle in
a mountainous area of Oaxaca state, 300 miles south of Mexico City.
   The attorney general gave this account at a news conference:
   Last Thursday highway police found a few pounds of cocaine in a
truck in Oaxaca and the driver and a passenger told them about
another truck. The second truck was stopped and it was carrying
1,190 pounds of cocaine.
   The driver also told officials where cocaine was being stored in
the mountains for shipment ``overland in small quantities.''
   When federal drug agents closed in on the location over the
weekend there was a gunfight in which six trafficker were killed
and to agents were wounded. Five suspects were arrested and others
are being sought.
   After the gun battle the agents found 187 canvas bags stuffed
with 4.5 tons of cocaine.
   He said only that the raid occurred over the weekend but police
sources said it was late Friday or early Saturday.
   Alvarez del Castillo reported the suspects said the cocaine had
been received from Bogota, Colombia, at a clandestine landing strip
and shipments had been arriving since February.
   He said the shipments were arranged by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
a kingpin in the Medellin cartel who is wanted by U.S. authorities.
   In recent months many drug arrests have included suspects linked
to Colombian gangs, but Alvarez del Castillo said he didn't believe
Colombian cartels are using Mexican routes more often than before.
   He attributed the increased arrests and drug seizures to greater
vigilance by police agents.

   Funeral services were held Monday for two
of the children killed by a tornado that slammed into their
elementary school. One victim's mother said her son's organs would
help keep other children alive.
   More than 200 mourners attended a funeral service in this city
for Mark Flanagan, 7, and 175 gathered for a service in Middletown
for Jennifer Homan, 8.
   Both died Wednesday of injuries suffered Nov. 16, when a tornado
brought a cafeteria wall on more than 100 students lunching at East
Coldenham Elementary School. Nine children were killed and 16 were
injured.
   Mark's mother, Jean Flanagan, told mourners at Sacred Heart
Roman Catholic Church that her son's kidneys, heart valves and
lymph nodes were donated to help young transplant patients.
   ``Mark, you will hlp children live on,'' she told her son's
cream-and-gold-colored casket.
   Mrs. Flanagan, who has seen two other children die and suffered
two miscarriages, said her faith made the family's latest tragedy
easier to bear.
   ``That's what gives me the strength to say goodbye to you, Mark,
to know that I will see you again and my other children,'' she said.
   ``The lad is with God,'' said Monsignor George Valastro of
Sacred Heart. He called the boy a saint.
   Eight clergy members attended the service, including Episcopal
Bishop Austin Vaughan, the vicar of Orange County.
   Mark's casket was escorted from the church by an honor guard of
firefighters, some of whom were first on the scene following the
twister.
   Firefighters also attended Jennifer's funeral, and a firetruck
led a procession of about 30 cars from a funeral home in Middletown
to a cemetery in nearby Phillipsburgh.
   In her casket were placed pink, stuffed pigs she had owned, her
tap-dancing shoes and notes from classmates.
   ``Dear Jen,'' one note read, ``I will miss you and never forget
you. I will never forget what happened ...''
   Newburgh is about 60 miles north of New York City. Middletown is
nearly 25 miles southwest of Newburgh.

   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega said
Monday the anti-aircraft rockets found at the site of a plane crash
in El Salvador could have been from a U.S. shipment sent years ago
to Nicaraguan rebels.
   The Salvadoran government on Sunday suspended relations with
Nicaragua, accusing the Sandinistas of shipping the rockets and
other weapons to leftist guerrillas.
   A light plane with no registration number crashed Saturday about
60 miles east of San Salvador, the Salvadoran capital, and military
officers said three crewmen were killed and the fourth committed
suicide, shooting himself in the head.
   The plane did not burn and Salvadoran troops found in the
wreckage 24 Soviet-made SA-7 anti-aircraft rockets, one
U.S.-manufactured Redeye rocket, a Soviet-designed recoilless rifle
and 21 Soviet mortar shells. Salvadoran military officials said the
plane's flight originated in Nicaragua and the craft crashed when
it ran out of fuel.
   Nicaragua has denied over the years repeated charges that it was
supplying aid to the Salvadoran rebels.
   Ortega said the rockets found Saturday could be part of a
shipment of 300 that the former Reagan administration sent to
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   ``Wasn't it the United States that in 1985 put in the hands of
terrorists the rockets that we don't know now where they are? They
can be in many different hands and markets,'' the defense minister
said.
   He made the comments at a ceremony marking Soldier's Day with
promotions and medals for troops wounded fighting the U.S.-backed
Contras. The defense minister is the brother of President Daniel
Ortega.
   Foreign Minsiter Miguel D'Escoto told reporters Nicaragua has
received no official notification from the Salvadoran governemnt
about a suspension of relations.
   ``We do not know what they are going to do. We have not broken
relations with them,'' D'Escoto said.
   Speaking about the arms shipment, he said, ``We know nothing
about the plane.''
   The Salvadoran diplomatic action could disrupt plans for a Dec.
8 meeting in Managua of five Central American presidents to resume
talks on the peace process for the region that includes
demobilization of the Contras.

   President Francois Mitterrand formally
opened Interpol's new headquarters beside the Rhone River Monday
and urged law enforcement officials from 147 countries to stop the
trade in illegal drugs.
   He told about 500 delegates at the organization's 58th annual
conference that losing the fight against drugs would represent `'a
collective failure of civilization.''
   The $22.5 million headquarters of the International Police
Organization _ Interpol _ replaced the organization's cramped
facilities in the Paris suburb of St. Cloud.
   Interpol acts as a clearing house for information among 147
countries. It does no investigating itself but provides members
with data on drug trafficking, terrorism and financial and other
crimes.
   Interpol officials say the new offices will allow the the
organization to expand its forensic capabilities and photo and
fingeprint files.
   It also will have a $645,000 communications system capable of
receiving and sending 7,000 messages per hour by telephone, telex
and radio.
   The structure will be easier to guard against attacks such as
the bombing by the Direct Action terrorist group in May 1986 that
wounded a police guard and seriously damaged the six-story building
in St. Cloud.

<TEXT>
   A Bogota newspaper that was bombed because of
its coverage of Colombia's drug trade is getting a helping hand
from newspaper publishers in the United States and elsewhere in its
effort to stave off bankruptcy.
   Thomas C. Fichter of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association, one of two trade associations coordinating a drive to
raise funds for the troubled daily El Espectador, said Monday the
Bogota newspaper should receive the initial instalment on a loan
this week.
   Fichter said El Espectador has declared that it needs $2.5
million to continue publishing because of the bombing and other
losses it has suffered from the campaign against it by the
Colombian drug cartel.
   ``Right now we have got about $l.6 million pledged or paid and
there are sufficient people we haven't heard from yet that we think
will bring us to the $2.5 million mark,'' Fichter said.
   The president of El Espectador, Luis Cano, toured the United
States in October seeking support from news organizations. He said
a car bomb that exploded near the newspaper's offices on Sept. 2
did $2.5 million worth of damage.
   ``They had to pull out the windows and put on news roofs and
incur other expenses, not knowing where they were going to get the
money to pay for it,'' Fichter said. ``Not to mention the fact
their advertising lineage has been curtailed because many of the
advertisers have been intimidated.''
   Cano's younger brother, Guillermo Cano, publisher of the paper,
was killed by drug traffickers in 1986.
   Two employes of the newspaper in Medellin, where the drug cartel
has its headquarters, were killed in October. The newspaper
suspended home delivery in Medellin because of fear on the part of
truck drivers and delivery boys.
   El Espectador has a circulation of 350,000. Cano has said it is
losing money and facing possible bankruptcy.
   Fichter said, ``I think it struck a number of people all at one
time that something needed to be done.''
   Among them, he said, were newspaper executives and Bruce Gelb,
director of the U.S. Information Agency.
   Marty C. Davis, director of public liaison for the USIA., said
in a letter to executives of news organizations Monday that Gelb
``took his concerns to newspaper publishers who agreed to try to
raise money to keep El Espectador's presses running.'' Gelb visited
the newspaper's offices in Bogota on Oct. l5.
   Fichter said ANPA is working with the Inter-American Press
Association of Miami in coordinating the fund-raising campaign. He
said money or pledges had been received from about 50 donors in the
United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.
   Both Fichter and Ms. Davis said money would be available to help
other newspapers after El Espectador's needs had been met.
   ``The money is a loan,'' he said. ``They will give it back, and
that will perepetuate it.''
   Fichter said the fund-raising effort was the largest of its kind
that he knew of, although the trade associations have helped
troubled newspapers in various countries in the past. After the
fighting in Grenada in 1984, for instance, they helped the
newspaper in the Caribbean island obtain a new press to replace one
that had been destroyed.

   More than one in 10 American smokers quit at
least for Nov. 16, the day of the Great American Smokeout,
according to a poll released Monday by the American Cancer Society.
   The poll of 1,201 men and women ages 18 and over found that 10.5
percent of cigarette smokers did not smoke at all that day and that
25.4 percent said they cut down on the amount they usually smoke.
   Society officials commissioned The Gallup Organization survey,
which found that 35.9 percent, or 17.9 million, of the nation's 50
million smokers participated in the smokeout.
   About three-quarters of those who quit for the day reported that
they were not smoking at least one day later, according to the poll
conducted by telephone Nov. 17-19.
   The cancer society said in a statement that 3.9 million were
still not smoking one to three days later.
   ``Once again we are very pleased that more than one-third of the
nation's hard-core smokers (nearly 18 million) participated in this
year's Great American Smokeout,'' said Dr. Robert J. Schweitzer,
national president of the American Cancer Society, based in
suburban Decatur.
   Noting the large number of smokers who quit for longer than the
smokeout, Schweitzer said, ``These statistics are a testament to
smokers' increasing awareness of the dangers posed by cigarette
smoking, and their desire to try to quit this addictive habit.''
   The study also found that more younger people tried to quit for
the day.
   The poll indicated 42 percent of those in the 18-34 age group
tried to quit compared with 33 percent in the 35-49 age group and
34 percent in the 50-and-over group.
   Poll results showed 85 percent of adults surveyed had heard of
the Great American Smokeout, which the cancer society hopes will
stir smokers to quit. Last year, 86 percent of the respondents
heard of the effort.
   Neither the American Cancer Society nor Gallup released the
margin of error.

   West Germany's ultraright-wing
Republican Party released on Monday a campaign platform calling for
a reunited Germany that would include territory lost in World War
II.
   Party chief Franz Schoenhuber, a former Waffen SS trooper,
announced the platform for next year's elections and said the
Republicans have set up organizations in ``several locations'' in
East Germany.
   He has made similar claims in the past. They were strongly
denied by East German communist authorities who say the Republican
Party is neo-Nazi.
   East Germany's official ADN news agency said Monday that
Republican leaflets have appeared in the country.
   ``Since the opening of the borders to the West, a rise in
activities of neo-Nazi groups in the direction of (East Germany)
can be noticed,'' ADN said.
   It said security officials will continue to fight all fascist,
neo-Nazi and racist tendencies.
   The Republicans' platform for the December 1990 federal
elections in West Germany calls for a confederation between the two
German states as a first step. It said free and secret elections
would follow to choose leaders of a unified German government based
in Berlin.
   It says East Germany must get out of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
and West Germany must leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
to permit ``a bloc-free, reunited Germany.''
   The 55-page program includes a map showing a united Germany and
including former German territories in Poland and the Soviet Union
that were lost with the defeat of Nazi Germany.
   Schoenhuber said the lands legally belong to Germany until a
peace treaty is signed.
   He claimed the party has ``tripled in membership to 25,000''
during the past year.

   Near-freezing temperatures were blamed
Monday for the death of a quadriplegic man whose electric
wheelchair became stuck along a gravel nature trail during an
outing.
   The temperature was about 46 degrees when Alan Rogers Sr., 40,
and friend William Felker left the Apple Tree Lane Rehabilitation
Care Center on Saturday afternoon and ventured onto the trail out
of sight and earshot of the center.
   Felker, also a quadriplegic, got his wheelchair stuck first and
warned Rogers, who continued about 20 more feet before his
wheelchair also got stuck, said administrator Joseph Richert.
   Felker dozed during night, while the temperature dipped to 34
degrees, and when he awoke early Sunday, Rogers was dead.
   Ellen Bouchard, director of community relations at the center,
said the medical examiner determined Monday that Roges died of
hypothermia.
   ``These two gentlemen were their own guardians,'' Bouchard said.
``They came and went from the facility as they chose to do.''
   Police in this city 20 miles west of Detroit were notified
shortly after midnight that the roommates were missing but did not
find them until 6 a.m. Sunday.

   Five young people who were stranded
for two nights in the rugged Blue Mountains were found and rescued
Monday after a pilot spotted the word ``help'' stamped in the snow,
officials said.
   ``They are cold and hungry, but other than that they appear to
be OK,'' Capt. Joyce Gerdes of the Umatilla County, Ore., Sheriff's
Department said after an Army National Guard helicopter flew the
five out.
   The five, aged 7 to 20, were airlifted from an area about 30
miles east of Walla Walla near the Oregon-Washington line, said
Gerdes, whose department coordinated the two-state search for the
five.
   They were taken to the Walla Walla Regional Aiport, where they
were turned over to relatives, she said.
   The distress call stamped in the snow was spotted by the pilot
of a private airplane, who notified the airport tower, Gerdes said.
   The five left Walla Walla around 8 p.m. Saturday, telling their
parents they were going to play in the snow at Tollgate, Ore., and
return later that night, said Umatilla County Sheriff Jim Carey.
   The youths said their four-wheel-drive vehicle got stuck in the
snow.
   ``Apparently they spent the first night in their car,'' said the
helicopter pilot, Tim Kelly. They took refuge Sunday in a U.S.
Forest Service fire lookout tower, he said.
   The search began early Sunday, and involved an airplane, a
helicopter and snowmobiles. The hunt moved into Oregon later in the
day after someone reported seeing the young people in the Tiger
Canyon area, 17 miles east of Weston in the northeastern section of
the state.
   Teams searched through the night.
   Umatilla County Deputy Keith Garoutte said searchers had to
contend with freezing temperatures and fog in the mountains, with
snow depths of up to a foot at the top of Tiger Canyon.

   A truck driver testified Monday how he
snatched some children from a burning church bus amid ``a constant
barrage of screams'' from the 27 people who were trapped and killed.
   The bus was ``blazing furiously'' soon after it was struck by
Larry Mahoney's pickup on Interstate 71, said James Thom of St.
Charles, Ill.
   ``There was a huge fireball. It was blazing. ... It was just
light like day,'' Thom said on the third day of testimony in
Mahoney's trial in Carroll Circuit Court.
   Mahoney, 36, is charged with 27 counts of murder. He also is
charged with 12 counts of first-degree assault, 42 counts of wanton
endangerment and one count of drunken driving.
   Mahoney is alleged to have driven in the wrong direction of
I-71, missing Thom's tractor-trailer and several other cars and
trucks before slamming into the bus at 10:55 p.m. on May 14, 1988.
   The former school bus, owned by Radcliff First Assembly of God
Church in Hardin County, 100 miles southwest of here, was returning
a youth group from an outing at an amusement park north of
Cincinnati.
   Jack Armstrong of Patriot, Ind., testified that he and his wife,
Joan, had been driving north behind Mahoney, and saw him driving in
the wrong lanes for about two miles before the crash.
   ``My wife screamed, `Oh my God, that's a school bus,'' recalled
Armstrong, who like his wife was once a school bus driver.
   He said he dashed to the back door of the bus and started
dragging children out one by one while his wife dragged survivors
off the pavement and into the grass median of the highway.
   Armstrong said he got ``maybe 25 or 30'' children out, but smoke
and heat kept him from rescuing more. Forty passengers survived the
wreck.
   Thom said he ground his truck to a halt and sprinted to the
burning bus.
   ``There was just a constant barrage of screams, cries for help _
people crying out, constant,'' he said.
   A few people were able to extend an arm or leg through the smoke
and fire toward the rear door ``and I just pulled,'' Thom said.
   He rescued ``three or four at the most,'' Thom said. ``The heat
and flames drove me away.''
   Mahoney buried his face in one hand during Thom's testimony,
tears streaming down his cheeks. Many of the victims' relatives in
the courtroom cried, too.
   The last person he rescued, Thom said, was a girl named Christy,
whose arms, face and legs were burned. He stayed with her until she
was evacuated, Thom said.
   Christy Pearman, 13 at the time of the crash, was the daughter
of bus driver John Pearman, one of three adults among the 27 who
died. The girl was in critical condition for several days after the
crash and represents one of the assault charges against Mahoney.
   Two other witnesses, former state trooper Robert Strong and
paramedic Tommy Webb, testified they saw cold cans of beer in the
cab of Mahoney's pickup.

   A leader of the Afghan resistance said Monday
he hopes President Bush will persuade Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev at their weekend summit to stop supporting the ``puppet
regime'' of Najibullah in Afghanistan.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddedi met with Bush in the Oval Office to thank
him and the American people for backing the Mujahedeen rebels in
their 11-year fight to oust the Soviet-backed government.
   Mojaddedi later told The Associated Press that he would ask U.S.
officials for high altitude anti-aircraft weapons to use against
Soviet planes that he said were still flying bombing missions from
Soviet territory.
   ``Still, the Russians our bombing our people, the Mujahedeen,
from their own territory,'' said Mojaddedi.
   Mojaddedi did not ask Bush directly for the weapons but said he
would raise the issue before he departs Washington on Friday.
   He also said that while he and Bush did not discuss next week's
meeting off Malta between the two superpower leaders, ``I am sure
that he will discuss (Afghanistan). It is a very important issue.''
   ``Gorbachev must be convinced that this is a puppet regime, that
the Afghanistan people do not support this ... puppet regime,'' he
said.
   Mojaddedi is the president of the Afghan Interim Government
formed by seven main resistance groups after the Soviet Union
completed the pullout of 115,000 troops from Afghanistan last
February.
   Covert U.S. military support for the rebels is reported to
exceed $500 million a year, but so far the United States has not
granted formal recognition to the rebels' government-in-exile based
in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   U.S. officials had hoped the resistance would quickly topple
Najibullah's government after the Soviet pullout. The rebels
control most of the Afghan countryside, but so far have been unable
to dislodge the Kremlin-backed forces from the capital of Kabul or
from Jalalabad and other major cities.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said in a statement
that Bush ``reaffirmed our support for the Afghan resistance's
efforts to achieve self-determination and also expressed U.S.
interest in a political settlement.''
   He said Bush ``called upon the Afghan Interim Government to
continue and increase its efforts to fashion a stable, broadly
based government responsive to the needs of the Afghan people.''
   Mojaddedi, asked why the rebels have been unable to topple
Najibullah, said the Soviets have withdrawn ``partly from
Afghanistan, not completely.''
   He said of Soviet soldiers, ``Still they are fighting in the
name of Afghans inside Afghanistan,'' and he also said Soviet
planes conduct bombing runs from their own territory against
northern Afghanistan.
   He charged the Soviet Union has doubled or tripled its support
for the Najibullah government since the pullout to at least $300
million a month. And he said the rebels did not get supplies for
eight or nine months.
   Asked about factional strife among the resistance fighters,
Mojaddedi called that ``wrong propaganda. We are not fighting
amongst ourselves. We are all united. ... Sometimes it happens, but
rarely, seldom.''
   ``The Mujahedeen from different parties, they are united. And if
we were not united, we would not have achieved such progress in our
struggle,'' he said.

   A hearing on whether the tanker captain
whose ship caused the nation's largest oil spill should stand trial
got under way Monday with witnesses recounting the hours after the
Exxon Valdez ripped its hull open.
   One said oil was welling up alongside the tanker at ``a rolling
boil.''
   Joseph Hazelwood, fired as an Exxon tanker captain after the
spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil, sat with his
counsel while they argued defense motions intended to show
Hazelwood is immune from the charges against him.
   Defense motions include claims that Hazelwood received immunity
from prosecution when he reported his ship's grounding and the oil
spill the morning it happened. A law intended to encourage
self-reporting of environmental calamities such as oil spills
provides protection against self-incrimination, laywers contend.
   That led state Assistant District Attorney Leonard Linton Jr. to
argue that discovery of the spill was inevitable and that
information about the disaster was available from a variety of
sources, not only from Hazelwood.
   Hazelwood was in charge of the 987-foot tanker when it hit the
reef early March 24 after leaving the Alaska oil pipeline terminal
at Valdez. The ship's cargo of heavy North Slope crude oil poured
into Prince William Sound, blackening shores, killing wildlife and
interrupting fishing seasons.
   Hazelwood, 43, a veteran mariner from Huntington, N.Y., is
scheduled for trial Jan. 22 on charges of reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil, all misdemeanors, and three felony counts of criminal mischief.
   Linton called witnesses Dan Lawn of the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation; Alaska Fish and Wildlife Protection
Trooper Michael Fox; and Mark Delozier, whose work as a Coast Guard
investigator in Valdez ended Nov. 1.
   Lawyers on both sides questioned Lawn about his activities after
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. notified him of the spill less than an
hour after the crash.
   Lawn, his agency's top representative in Valdez at the time of
the accident, said he called his Anchorage supervisor and told him
``this was the nightmare we had been dreading.''
   Lawn said he went to the ship with the Coast Guard a couple
hours after the crash and found oil welling up around the vessel _
``a rolling boil, if you will.'' He said he saw Hazelwood, who
appeared ``quiet and pensive,'' but didn't speak to him beyond an
introduction.
   Fox said he was contacted by the Coast Guard and assumed he was
wanted to help ``deal with a drunken sailor.''
   ``I got up onto the bridge fully expecting to have to deal with
a drunk-type situation, and it wasn't that at all,'' he said.
   ``It was a very sad, quiet-type situation.''
   Fox said he was asked to obtain a blood sample from Hazelwood
because intoxication was suspected. But Fox said he wasn't prepared
to collect blood and conduct an investigation without evidence of a
crime. The sample was drawn by a Coast Guard official about 10
hours after the grounding.
   The trooper said he was trying to figure out what problem caused
the tanker wreck and Hazelwood told him: ``You're looking at it.''
   Delozier, who spent two days aboard the tanker after the wreck,
said he detected ``a strong odor of alcohol coming from Captain
Hazelwood.''
   He said Fox apparently hadn't been informed about the need to
draw samples for alcohol screenings.
   Delozier also said he urged his wife to talk to state troopers
because she recognized Hazelwood from a newspaper photograph about
a week after the accident and remembered seeing him in a Valdez
establishment that serves alcohol.
   If convicted of the three felonies, Hazelwood faces a possible
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and $100,000 in fines.

   The attorney general Monday reinstated a
first-degree murder charge against a man in the 1976 car-bomb
assassination of investigative reporter Don Bolles, saying he had
turned up new evidence.
   James Albert Robison, who was charged in a complaint filed in
Maricopa County Superior Court, who is serving a prison term for an
unrelated assault.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin said the investigation into the
Arizona Republic reporter's slaying would continue, but would not
say whether others would be charged.
   Robison's attorney, Tom Henze, said his client would plead
innocent if the complaint survives a preliminary hearing scheduled
for next month.
   The complaint did not give details on the new evidence or give a
motive for the slaying, but Corbin said the state had amassed
enough evidence to seek the death penalty.
   Assistant Attorney General Warren Granville said the state would
call several witnesses at the preliminary hearing.
   Last month, The Associated Press reported that Corbin had
convened a state grand jury to investigate allegations of
obstruction in the Bolles case.
   State law makes it a crime to disclose grand jury matters.
Corbin declined Monday to confirm that there was a grand jury probe
or whether there was any connection between it and Monday's charge.
   Bolles died 11 days after the car he was in was blown up by a
remote-controlled bomb.

<HEAD>Abu Nidal Under Arrest in Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal has been placed
under house arrest by Libya in recent days, according to a
published report.
   Abu Nidal has been confined to the compound where he lives near
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, as a result of Arab and Palestinian
pressure to end his terrorist activities, which were becoming an
obstacle to Arab diplomacy, The New York Times reported in
Tuesday's editions.
   Abu Nidal's organization, the Fatah Revolutionary Council, is
believed responsible for terrorist attacks that have killed or
wounded 900 people in at least 20 countries since it was formed in
1974.
   Palestine Liberation Organization officials told the Times
Nidal's detention could be the start of the demise of the Fatah
Revolutionary Council. A growing number of its leaders and members
have defected to the PLO under pressure from the PLO and Arab
governments.
   The Times, quoting PLO officials in Tunisia and Arab diplomats
in Paris, said Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak in October asked
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, as a condition for restored
relations between their countries, either to extradite Abu Nidal to
Egypt or stop his undertaking terrorist acts from Libya.
   There is no indication that Gadhafi intends to turn Abu Nidal
over to Egypt, the officials told the Times.
   Abu Nidal, 52, is the nom de guerre of Sabry al-Banna.
   ``The man's time is over,'' an unidentified senior Arab diplomat
and former intelligence official told the Times. ``He is becoming
useless to all those who have used him.''
   Abu Nidal, who has lived in Libya since he was expelled from
Syria in 1987, is wanted in Egypt for, among other things, the
hijacking of an Egypt Air flight that ended with the deaths of 56
passengers in Malta in 1985 during an attempted rescue.

   The former head of the U.S. Southern Command
says the Bush administration ousted him from his post in Panama for
political reasons because he opposed U.S. policies in that country.
   ``I believe the policy was flawed,'' Gen. Fred Woerner said in
an interview in which he described the administration's goals as
simplistic and short-sighted.
   ``The specific language was, the president decided it was time
for a change,'' Woerner said in describing how Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney told him in July that he was being removed. ``And
then when I said I was entitled to more of an explanation ... I was
told it had nothing to do with performance but (was for) political
reasons.''
   Woerner's contention contradicts the Pentagon's denial in July
when it announced he was being replaced.

   Cholesterol screenings in shopping malls and
other public settings often can be inaccurate, pose hygiene risks
and frequently fail to provide counseling or physician referral, a
government report said today.
   The report by the Department of Health and Human Services'
inspector general recommends federal regulation of all cholesterol
screenings that are not conducted by health care professionals.
   An investigation by the inspector general found that basic rules
of hygiene were often ignored, qualifications and training of
testers varied widely and public screenings often lacked the
optimal conditions needed to produce accurate results with portable
analyzers.
   ``The public in general is not aware of these shortcomings, and
does not know what to look for in safe, high-quality public
screening programs,'' said the report.

   Talks between the newspapers and the unions broke off Sunday

Supreme Court, which upheld lower court rulings approving the

   Drug dealers owe the state $33.3 million in
unpaid taxes and penalties on their pot, cocaine and other illegal
uppers and downers, and the Revenue Department has collected only
$23,392.96.
   But officials say the tax on illegal drug sales does more than
bring in revenue. It gives prosecutors an easy-to-prove charge that
can mean a longer prison sentence or a better bargaining position
when defendants want to plea bargain.
   Revenue chief Ed Rolfs, whose office made the estimate of how
much is owed, said his agency became more active in trying to
collect taxes on illegal drugs earlier this year, after the 1987
law survived a legal challenge. He said it may collect $500,000
next year.
   ``The prosecutors are using it,'' said David Johnson, director
of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. ``Prosecutors, I think, take
it very seriously, and I know law enforcement takes it very
seriously.''

   The much-maligned donkey is making a
comeback in Texas and other states, where ranchers know that
coyotes keep their distance when the stubborn beasts are making
asses of themselves.
   It's the ``deliberate'' disposition of the donkey, and the
animal's innate dislike of canines, that makes them useful guarding
goats and sheep against coyotes and other predators, said rancher
Nanci Falley.
   State officials say the donkey guard, an old-time form of
protection, is enjoying a resurgence on ranches around the country.
   ``It's such a natural thing for a donkey,'' said Ms. Falley, who
also sells the guard animals. ``It's not something that requires
training. They have a natural instinct to run dogs and coyotes out
of their territory.''

<HEAD>Republicans Trying to Isolate Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In simpler times, a politician, a president,
could tailor his message to fit his audience, and chances were the
adjustments would go unnoticed.
   In the era of instant communications that doesn't work very
well; television makes all audiences into one. But President Bush
and some other Republican leaders are trying to deal with the
abortion issue as though the old way might still work.
   The objective seems to be to deal with abortion separately,
apart from other issues. That's understandable as abortion becomes
an increasingly worrisome topic for Republicans, who saw it work
against their 1989 candidates. The trouble is that isolating issues
is as difficult as fine-tuning speeches.
   For example, Republicans pride themselves on a philosophy that
seeks to keep government from intruding on private decision-making.
Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois, who favors abortion rights,
suggested that GOP tenet could be cast into doubt by a candidate
opposed to abortion, since that would involve the government in one
of the most sensitive of private decisions.
   He raised the question at a conference of Republican governors
earlier this month. It already had been answered in one election:
Virginia Democrats made effective use of that theme in narrowly
winning the contest for governor.
   Bush had said in advance there was no evidence that single-issue
voters would make abortion a decisive issue. But in the hairbreadth
Virginia verdict, it almost certainly influenced enough votes to
shape the outcome.
   That points to the Democratic course in dealing with abortion in
the 1990 campaign. Their 1989 candidates succeeded in claiming the
center on the issue. Strategists for both parties agree that is
where the majority of the voters are, pro and anti-abortion
zealotry notwithstanding. ``My sense on this issue is that the
American people are in the middle,'' said William Bennett, the drug
policy chief, offering the governors' conference some unsolicited
advice.
   But the Republicans have had more trouble getting there.
   Bush's own position has come all the way from support for the
1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion to ardent,
active opposition. He vetoed four appropriations bills this fall
because they would have permitted the use of tax dollars to pay for
abortions for needy women who were victims of rape or incest. Bush
would permit abortion in those cases, but not with public funds.
   The Republican Party platform advocates a constitutional
amendment to bar abortions. That doesn't bind anybody; as GOP
leaders hasten to point out, party platforms usually are ignored.
But it does set a starting point.
   The national party position that counts is the one anti-abortion
course President Bush is setting.
   The Bush administration has been urging the Supreme Court to
overturn its original abortion decision. That call is repeated in
administration briefs on two cases that are to be argued before the
court tomorrow, on Ohio and Minnesota laws requiring that parents
be notified before abortions are performed on their teen-age
daughters.
   On a narrowed issue such as parental advice or consent for
teen-age abortions, the opinion surveys and the political
strategists agree that a candidate probably could find majority
backing. When it is broadened and simplified into a flat yes or no
on abortion rights, it's hard to handle.
   Bush said there is plenty of room in the Republican Party for
differing opinions on abortion, and among Democrats, too.
   On Nov. 14, Bush met with four Republican women House members
who support abortion rights, listened to their arguments, but said
his own views are not subject to change. His spokesman then said
that agreement on abortion was not a test of support; that Bush
would back all Republican candidates, without regard to positions
differing from his own.
   Two of the four House women want to move to the Senate in the
1990 elections, and Bush campaigned for them last week. He avoided
the abortion issue, speaking as though it didn't exist.
   At a Chicago fundraising reception for Rep. Lynn Martin of
Illinois, Bush said the congresswoman has been ``right on issue
after issue. She thinks like I do, like you do.''
   Then he went to Providence in behalf of Rep. Claudine Schneider
of Rhode Island, and praised her independence. ``I always know
exactly where she stands,'' the president said.
   Flying home on Air Force One, he vetoed another bill because of
abortion funding. Rep. Schneider, a presidential passenger, said
she was disappointed.
   Looking for the lessons of 1989, Chairman Lee Atwater and other
Republican leaders are counseling 1990 candidates to take clear
positions on abortion, state them early in the campaign, and stand
firm.
   Bennett told the governors he won't mind if Republicans are a
minority because they stand on principle.
   He holds office by appointment.

<HEAD>Today's Puzzle: What Is an American Company Doing Helping Japan?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ARMONK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imagine an American company that sponsors a
science prize in Japan to ``breed a succession of next-generation
Japanese Nobel Prize winners.''
   Imagine an American company that calls itself ``a valuable
source of European strength in the drive for greater efficiency,
and in competition for world markets.''
   What is this American company doing, shooting itself in the
foot? No. The company is International Business Machines Corp., and
it is acting very much in its own self-interest.
   IBM's generosity in Japan, Europe and elsewhere may not please
congressmen and government officials who are trying to build up the
United States to fight foreign rivals. But then, that's not IBM's
goal.
   IBM, as its name implies, is a truly international company that
just happens to have headquarters on a wooded hilltop in a small
town about 25 miles north of Manhattan.
   Overseas, IBM is happy to be thought of as a local company. The
perception helps the company sell more locally, hire the best
people in each country and get good treatment from local
governments on such issues as taxes and tariffs.
   C. Michael Armstrong, a native of Detroit, is proud of IBM's
success in spreading its research, manufacturing, sales and service
operations into every corner of the world.
   ``IBM to some degree has successfully lost its American
identity,'' the senior vice president in charge of IBM World Trade
Corp. said in an interview in his corner office earlier this year.
   IBM is the very model of a modern multinational. Others include
West Germany's Siemens AG, the Netherlands' NV Philips and, to a
lesser degree, American companies such as General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co., which are entrenched in Europe and have alliances
with Japanese automakers.
   The future belongs to such companies, which float above national
boundaries, obeying the rules in every country where they operate
but belonging to no country in particular.
   These companies are not merely multinationals, but
transnationals, transcending international borders.
   It takes real effort to change perspective and see companies in
this light. Most political leaders continue to miss the point by
judging companies according to where their headquarters happen to
be.
   Governments of individual nations are going to have to learn how
to deal with transnational companies in ways that benefit their own
people. It is not an easy task, because governments have less
leverage against a transnational than against a company that does
all its business locally.
   A transnational company is like a living organism, with each
part dependent on the others for survival. A government that tried
to nationalize an IBM factory would find itself with a useless
asset because IBM would cut the factory off from its worldwide
system of distribution, manufacturing and research.
   Fortunately for the United States, IBM does have a strong
commitment to this country, which after all remains its largest
single market and source of employees. For example, IBM has shared
some of its most advanced computer chip technology with other U.S.
companies to assure itself of a steady supply of chips from outside
suppliers.
   On the other hand, U.S.-based transnationals like IBM, GM and
Ford have few qualms about importing parts and even whole products
for the American market, even though making them here would create
more jobs for Americans in design and manufacturing.
   The point is not that these companies are somehow disloyal or
treacherous. The point is that their interests do not always match
the U.S. national interest.
   The issue is more important than ever now that Washington is
debating how to dole out the benefits of an industrial policy _
that is, a program to improve the ability of this nation to compete
in world markets.
   Harvard University's Robert B. Reich, a professional skeptic,
put it this way in an essay earlier this year in The New Republic:
   ``Our economic future, as well as our national security, is
better served by developing a large corps of technologically
sophisticated workers within the nation than by boosting the
profitability of America's global corporations.''

<HEAD>One Year After Quake, Leninakan Mired in Mud and Memories</HEAD>

   A year after an earthquake smashed
northwestern Armenia into rubble, the city of Leninakan is a
shantytown of mud and memories.
   The Garapetyans do laundry by boiling their clothes in a bucket
on a tiny wood stove. The stove also heats a makeshift cabin they
built from remains of their former apartment building next door.
   Far above, rain lashes the wallpaper of their old living room on
the fourth floor, which was exposed when the side of the building
sheared off.
   ``We're afraid of living in a large building again,'' Meruzhan
Garapetyan said.
   Popular songs speak of the disaster of Dec. 7, 1988, when an
earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale killed at least
25,000 people and destroyed the homes of 500,000 more.
   ``Oh earthquake, what have you done?'' one asks. ``Why did you
leave so many parents without their children? ... You covered them
with stones and dirt and left their parents in tears.''
   The Armenian relief agency Search says 20,000 people still are
missing, 2,000 of them children. Daily life is slogging through
mud, relying on relatives and wondering when normality will return.
   A quake of 7.1 magnitude in the San Francisco area on Oct. 17
killed only 66 people. Damage was estimated at $7 billion, but much
of the destruction was cleared and service restored within weeks.
   In Leninakan, Armenia's second-largest city, Vartan Oganisyan
and his family of five live in a shack made from bits of sheet
metal, wood scraps, tar paper and salvaged window frames.
   Other families crowd into half-shattered buildings, construction
huts, army tents, round Mongolian yurts, abandoned railway cars and
even gasoline tanks fitted with doors and windows. A few open
cooking fires can be seen in the twilight.
   Electrical power is intermittent as Armenia enters the bitter
Soviet winter.
   Children bundle up for classes in temporary, unheated buildings.
They wake up crying at night and run from classrooms in fright at
the slightest noise.
   After school they play ``earthquake,'' recreating the disaster
in the muddy streets.
   Hundreds of people go to the huge city cemetery after work. Many
graves are marked only by the flowers relatives leave.
   Sofik Torunyan, who lost both children, was there on what would
have been her daughter's 20th birthday, with a cake fashioned from
carnations.
   ``Oh, my young daughter! Oh, my love!'' she wailed, holding onto
a friend. ``Why didn't I die, too, so I would not have to live
without you?''
   People struggle on, helping each other. Hospitality and pride
remain.
   A dozen families share the only bathroom on their block that
still works. A boy paints the window frame in his family's shack.
Visitors are offered coffee and sweets, but often there is no
electricity to boil water.
   Maria Tumanyan, who lives in the ground floor of a severely
cracked five-story building, insists that ``we're making great
progress.'' She concentrates on the vast stretches cleared of
broken concrete and twisted metal, not the rubble remaining.
   The town of Spitak was leveled. Kirovakan and 300 villages were
shattered.
   In Leninakan, which had 235,000 residents, the quake destroyed
99 nine-story apartment buildings, 10 schools and every factory,
officials said.
   Reconstruction has lagged badly. Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the Soviet
premier, said in November that the crash program to rebuild in two
years already was a year behind schedule, meaning virtually nothing
had been accomplished.
   Residents blame disorganization, central planning's failure to
supply enough building materials and a two-month blockade of
Armenia by ethnic enemies in neighboring Azerbaijan.
   Many foreigners building schools and hospitals went home because
supply shipments were held up on rail lines in Azerbaijan.
   By early November, only three new buildings had been completed,
all by the army for the army.
   Karlin Ambartsumyan, chairman of the city Communist Party
committee, still hopes to move 4,000 families into a vast new
suburb before year's end, but even that would be only one-fifth as
many as planned.
   For now, Ambartsumyan is concentrating on getting the remaining
homeless among the 190,000 people now living in Leninakan into
construction huts and other temporary housing, and getting heat for
them before winter.
   Svetlana Asaturyan lives in one such hut, generously called a
``little house'' in Russian but in reality a two-room insulated
packing crate.
   She and her family of five must haul water from a block away,
use nearby bushes as a toilet and travel to a relative's place for
showers. Her washing flaps over a sea of mud.
   Mrs. Asaturyan is grateful, however, because they used to be in
the remains of the towel factory where she once worked, and where
30 of her co-workers were killed.
   Her ``little house,'' like thousands of others, showed up
without a door, window glass, heater, wiring or furniture. It was
vandalized en route, apparently by Azerbaijanis, whom the Armenians
accuse of stealing or destroying relief supplies.
   When asked about the Soviet leadership's promise to rebuild in
two years, Mrs. Asaturyan said: ``I'll be glad if I get a home
within five years.''
   About 20,000 of the homeless are scheduled to receive apartments
in the new suburb as sections are completed over 18 months. A
forest of 129 cranes towers over the site, and buildings faced with
local salmon-colored stone gleam in the sun.
   Because nine-story apartment blocks shoddily built of pre-formed
concrete panels collapsed in the quake, the new buildings are made
by assembling vault-like precast rooms, foreman Gennady Pogosov
said. None is more than four stories high.
   In May, a commission of the ruling Politburo blamed most of the
deaths on shoddy construction and gave its findings to prosecutors.
No charges have been filed, said Haik Minasyan, an Armenian
government spokesman.
   Only a few projects are under way in the city itself. On the
central square, a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin looks over a scene of
devastation: a ruined school, department store, government
building, post office, shops and a sock factory.
   Cafes and movie theaters are gone. So are most food stores, and
shopping sometimes amounts to picking over piles of cabbages and
potatoes at what remains of the bus station.
   Ambartsumyan said experts had ruled out reconstruction on half
the original city lots because the ground is too unstable.

   His family hasn't seen Araik Sukasyan
since the earthquake destroyed his school a year ago, but they
speak of him celebrating his 13th birthday soon and hope a Moscow
psychic can tell them where.
   ``We wait to find him alive,'' said his mother, Galine, weeping
as she pulled out Araik's school portrait. She hopes publicity will
bring word from someone who has taken him in, if that happened.
   The fourth grader vanished in the rubble of School No. 9 along
with more than 500 other people when the earthquake hit Leninakan
during school hours Dec. 7, 1988.
   Authorities say it killed 25,000 people, but the Armenian relief
agency Search says 20,000 more still are missing, including 2,000
children.
   ``They are not counted on the list of the dead or on the list of
those evacuated,'' said Ashot Georgyan, director of the Search
office in Yerevan, capital of Soviet Armenia. He said he had no way
of knowing how many of the 20,000 were dead and how many were just
separated from their families.
   ``We are now continuing the search for children, particularly
orphans, who were sent in groups to various points in the Soviet
Union and are still there in sanatoriums and resorts,'' Georgyan
said.
   Many parents, like the Sukasyans, believe officials may have
lost track of some evacuees.
   Larissa Vagashakovna, head of the Moscow office of Search, said
she had asked in vain for state television to show pictures of the
missing children.
   ``It's impossible to forget the faces of these parents,'' she
said. ``They haven't found the corpse and they haven't found the
child. Where have they disappeared to?''
   Araik's sister, Narina, also was in School No. 9 when it
crumpled. She escaped, and when her mother came running from home,
Narina cried: ``Momma, I am alive, but I can't find my brother!''
   For a month after the earthquake, the Sukasyan family watched
workers claw through the concrete and dust that had been School No.
9.
   Searchers found the bodies, or identifiable parts of bodies, of
420 students and 26 teachers. There was no sign of 100 others,
including Araik.
   ``There were people where they found only one leg, and
identified the shoe or the skirt, and they buried that,'' said Lida
Grigoryan, a teacher at another school and a friend of the family.
   The Sukasyans searched hospitals, opened every one of thousands
of coffins at the cemetery and telephoned relief agencies in
Yerevan and Moscow.
   They found no sign of their son and cling to the hope that
someone took him away.
   ``In Moscow, there is a woman who can see where someone is by
looking at his picture. We hope she can help,'' Araik's mother
said. Then she was worried again, because reports say the psychic's
powers only work with an original photograph.
   ``This is a copy,'' she said, staring at her son's young,
serious face.

   For Fidel Castro, the 1980s have been the worst
of times. Today, with the communist world in upheaval, the Cuban
president stands virtually alone in clinging stubbornly to a
socialist orthodoxy that each year seems to have fewer adherents.
The Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev has changed so much that
Castro has implied that he wonders how much longer the
Moscow-Havana alliance can last.

<TEXT>
   It was a moment Fidel Castro savored. One
could forgive him if he felt a bit smug as he stood before the
large gathering at Havana's ultramodern convention center. After
all, the mighty United States had tried for years to isolate him
and, here he was, about to gavel to order one of the largest summit
meetings in history. With 55 heads of government on hand for the
festivities, Castro looked like a man ready to pop a champagne cork.
   But that was 10 years ago. The memory of that September 1979
summit meeting of the non-aligned movement, a collection of Third
World countries, has long since receded. Since then, almost nothing
has gone right for Castro and, at this juncture, almost 31 years
deep into the Cuban revolution, his prospects seldom have looked
bleaker, most analysts say. It's hard to imagine any leader who
will welcome the passing of the 1980s more earnestly than Castro.
   In an age of pragmatists, he stands almost alone in clinging
tenaciously to a socialist orthodoxy that each year seems to have
fewer adherents. His anti-Americanism is as unbridled as ever but
in a time when economic concerns dominate the global agenda, the
United States is increasingly looked upon as a partner for trade
and investment rather than as an expansionist power bent on
imposing its will on others, essentially Cuba's view.
   Many Third World countries _ Angola, Mozambique and Guinea
Bissau, to name a few _ that Castro once saw as partners in the
international socialist movement have begun selling off inefficient
state industries and are adopting market practices. The disrepute
of communism throughout Eastern Europe is widespread and the
demands for democratic reform are becoming increasingly strident.
Strikes in the Soviet Union and mass protests in China by workers
and students have exposed weaknesses in the Marxist approach, but
Castro's commitment to that course seems unbudging.
   The Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev has drifted so far from
Castro's vision of the United States that the Cuban leader has
implied he wonders how much longer the 2-decade-old Moscow-Havana
alliance can last. While Castro rants about the ``imperialists,''
Moscow makes deals with them, and there is even talk of a
Soviet-American partnership. It is no longer astonishing to suggest
that the Kremlin seems closer to Washington in some ways than it
does to Havana. Two of the countries for which Castro has felt the
closest ideological kinship, East Germany and Vietnam, are bleeding
refugees at a rate that leaves defenders of the socialist faith
groping for explanations.
   U.S. officials say Castro's dilemma is that he can't start a
Soviet-style reform process without robbing his own revolution of
its identity. He has been determined from the outset to create a
society that bears as little resemblance as possible to the United
States. He has associated the United States with all of the evils
of pre-revolutionary Cuban society _ prostitution, gambling
casinos, repressive military government, foreign domination,
exploitative capitalism, unemployment, illiteracy and disease. But
while eradicating the worst abuses of the past and eliminating U.S.
influence almost completely, he has built a new society plagued by
chronic shortages and showing little economic vitality.
   But if Castro adopted Soviet-style reforms, that would call into
question the most basic premises of the revolution, one of which is
that the United States, with its disreputable value system and
unquenchable expansionist tendencies, is on the losing side of
history. He shows no sign of backtracking from that view.
   ``Will he change before he dies?'' asks Castro biographer
Georgie Anne Geyer. ``No, he is an extraordinarily unified,
stubborn man.''
   Castro, 63, seemed to confirm that view last January when he
said: ``Socialism or death. Marxism-Leninism or death.'' He has not
retreated from his position that Cuba is in the vanguard of an
international process, governed by irrevocable ``historical
forces,'' that will end with the worldwide triumph of socialism. It
is an increasingly lonely stand, shared by North Korea and a small
and diminishing number of others.
   ``No one, beyond perhaps Nicaragua, looks to Cuba for political
and economic leadership and inspiration,'' says Sally
Shelton-Colby, who served during the Carter administration as an
expert on Latin American affairs.
   Far from mellowing as his revolution approaches middle age,
Castro stresses increased reliance on moral incentives, cracking
down on ideological deviants and arresting human rights activists
thought to be too irreverent in their criticism of the government.
   This past summer, Castro even banned two Soviet Spanish language
publications _ products of the glasnost era under Gorbachev _ which
Castro felt were downright subversive. According to independent
human rights groups, about 30 Cubans who spoke to delegates from a
United Nations human rights panel that visited Cuba last year are
now in prison.
   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights, Richard
Schifter, says that in Cuba there is ``complete intolerance for the
slightest form of dissent.'' (Cuban officials reply that it is
safer to be a dissident in Cuba than in most Central American
countries, where non-conformists risk being targeted by death
squads, a phenomenon unknown in Cuba.)
   1989 also produced the biggest political scandal in the history
of the revolution. In July, four high-level military and
intelligence officers, including a highly decorated Army hero, Maj.
Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, were executed for drug trafficking,
corruption and ``betraying the revolution.''
   Seven weeks later, a former interior minister, one of Castro's
closest confidants, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse
of office and other charges related to drug trafficking.
   The cases shocked many Cubans, who had long been taught that
high officials were models of revolutionary rectitude. Some
analysts contend the crackdown was related less to a drive for law
and order than to a move by Castro to eliminate possible rivals and
reformers.
   A decade ago, the world seemed more congenial to Castro. 1979
produced for Castro two new ideological allies in the hemisphere _
Grenada and Nicaragua. The ouster of El Salvador's military
dictatorship in October of that year seemed to breathe new life
into the leftist insurgency there. In Washington, the Carter
administration appeared overwhelmed by crises both foreign and
domestic.
   In one unhappy four-week period, U.S. embassies in three Islamic
countries were assaulted by angry mobs.

   The administration seemed especially inept when it announced the
``discovery'' of a Soviet brigade in Cuba, only to ruefully
acknowledge later that it had been there all along.
   Castro's international reach extended well into Africa, where
thousands of Cuban soldiers were deployed in support of pro-Soviet
regimes in Angola and Ethiopia.
   But, perhaps as a portent for the bleak decade that lay ahead
for Castro, just four days before the 1970s ended the Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan, creating an extremely uncomfortable situation
for Castro in view of Afghanistan's role as a founding member of
the non-aligned movement.
   The invasion occurred less than four months after Castro was
touting to the non-aligned summit in Havana that the Soviet Union
was the ``natural ally'' of the movement. The overwhelming majority
of the more than 100 members in the movement criticized the Soviet
action when it came up in the United Nations; Cuba, despite
Castro's role as chairman of the movement, consistently cast its
vote with Moscow. Now even the Soviets themselves have repudiated
the invasion of Afghanistan, calling it a ``most serious
violation'' of Soviet norms.
   For Castro, one of the most dispiriting events of the 1980s
began less than 100 days after the decade began. In April, Castro
opened the port of Mariel to Cubans wishing to head north to
Florida. For five months, wave upon wave of Cubans _ an average of
almost 1,000 a day _ escaped the island on the Mariel ``freedom
flotilla'' until Castro closed the port in September. The departure
of that many Cubans left the impression among many that something
was gravely wrong with the revolution.
   Other reverses were to come. The election of perhaps the most
committed anti-Castro American president in the history of the
revolution, Ronald Reagan, meant no respite for Cuba as far as
Washington was concerned. Reagan steadily tightened loopholes in
the economic embargo against Cuba and also dealt setbacks to Castro
in other ways.
   The Cuban-backed government in Grenada was ousted by a U.S.
invasion in 1983. Reagan, meanwhile, was arming anti-communist
insurgents in Nicaragua and was sending large-scale military
assistance to El Salvador to help counter Cuban-backed leftist
guerrillas. The overall trend in the hemisphere was toward
democracy, not violent revolution. Castro's high hopes of acquiring
new allies in the hemisphere have been stalled.
   Not long after Castro assumed power, President John F. Kennedy
was worried that Cuban-style upheavals could erupt all over the
hemisphere. As the 1980s end, says Sally Shelton-Colby, the
``growing rejection'' of the Cuban model even by the Latin American
left is ``the single most startling change'' that has occurred in
the hemisphere in 20 years.
   Domestically, Castro can point to some successes, particularly
in social services. There is quite possibly no leader anywhere who
pays closer attention to meeting the health needs of his people
than Castro, and his efforts have produced impressive results. Cuba
says its infant mortality rate is about a half to a third less than
that of the Soviet Union. The good health of Cubans is underscored
by the unusually large number of world-class athletes the country
continually produces.
   Castro also is able to boast that virtually every school-age
child has access to education. A child in Cuba has a much better
chance of becoming a healthy, productive adult in Cuba than, say,
in Peru. If the revolution sometimes falls short in its promise of
a job for everybody, Cuba's employment rates certainly have been
much higher than the typical Latin American country.
   But critics, such as Professor Irving Louis Horowitz at Rutgers
University, maintain that the Cuba that Castro inherited in 1959
was not a typical Latin American country. He claims Cuba was the
third-ranking developed country in Latin America in 1959 and now
ranks ``something like 16th or 18th'' because of Marxist economics.
   The undercurrent of dissatisfaction is obvious. For many, access
to jobs, education and health care is not enough. There are
powerful constraints on personal and political freedom, and life
for many is a chore. Rationing imposes strict constraints on both
diet and fashion, lines are long at stores and restaurants,
commuting is a nightmare and recreational opportunities are scarce.
   Castro has acknowledged the existence of widespread corruption
at government enterprises. He also complained about a tendency
among Cubans not to give their best effort on the job or not to
show up for work at all. Despite Castro's exhortations, the work
ethic among many Cubans is sadly lacking, partly a result of a
system that provides only meager material rewards for a day's work.
As many observers see it, Castro's vision of a nation populated by
selfless workers who think only of the common good seems illusory.
He once said he never visited a construction site without finding
the workers taking a break.
   If Reagan's landslide re-election in 1984 was grim news for
Castro, there was an even more ominous development seven weeks
after Reagan's second inauguration. The death of Konstantin
Chernenko, secretary general of the Soviet Communist Party, did not
seem to be a momentous event at the time. But the accession of
Mikhail Gorbachev not only transformed the face of East-West
relations it also has raised questions for the first time about the
durability of the once seemingly unshakable Soviet-Cuban alliance.
   Analysts wonder how long the Soviets will be willing to continue
subsidizing the Cuban economy at the rate of more than $4 billion
annually, particularly if the Soviets continue their policy of
focusing increasingly on domestic problems while de-emphasizing
international issues. As the Cuban troop commitment to pro-Soviet
regimes in Africa fades and Castro becomes less useful politically
to the Kremlin, Moscow's compulsion to assist Cuba economically
presumably will fade with it. According to the current schedule,
the last of Cuba's troops will be leaving Angola early in 1991.
   Castro can point to some achievements during the decade. The
Cuban military presence in Africa was a major factor in bringing
about the removal of South African forces from Angola and the
breakthrough in 1988 toward independence in Namibia.
   Once feared as a promoter of violent revolution and scorned by
his neighbors, Castro now has normal diplomatic relations with most
Latin American countries. Over the past year, he has attended
presidential inaugurals in Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador. Cuba even
received the support of Latin America, over U.S. objections, for
one of the U.N. Security Council seats reserved for that region and
will begin a two-year stint on the council starting in January, a
new role for Cuba as the next decade begins.
   Mark Falcoff, resident fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, a research organization, says the new decade might
produce for Castro a crisis of a different nature for his
revolution.
   ``Without allies, without enemies, without an `internationalist
mission,' can Cuba survive?'' Falcoff asks. ``This promises to be
one of the really interesting questions for the next decade and
beyond.''

   With a donated boat and an eighth-grade
education, a third-generation fisherman tries to stem the decline
of the waters that sustain him. Terry Backer, the first Long Island
Soundkeeper, considers his work a legacy to his children.

   As the third generation of his family to
earn a living from the rich shellfish beds of Long Island Sound,
Terry Backer grew up well-versed in the language of the sea.
   As spoken by his father and grandfather, it was an ancient
language, as timeless and salty as the currents and tides.
   In Backer's lifetime, that has changed. New words _ petroleum
hydrocarbons, bacterial effluvium, polychlorinated biphenyls _ have
seeped into the fisherman's vocabulary.
   ``As a child,'' says the 36-year-old Backer, ``I would yell at
people not to throw things in the water. I've been hollering at my
dad since I was 8 years old for throwing cigarette butts or soda
cans overboard. It just struck me that they didn't belong.
   ``Dad would say, `You can't compare a soda can to 300 million
pounds of sewage.' The hell you can't. It's the exact same
philosophy at work.''
   If a man takes offense at a stray cigarette butt, how does he
feel about PCBs in his bluefish? If he finds floating soda cans an
affront, how does he cope with petroleum hydrocarbons?
   Terry Backer has coped by learning a new language, peppered with
such terms as ``fax machine,'' ``environmental litigation'' and
``regulatory process.''
   The time once spent fishing for oysters and pulling lobster
traps is now given to tracking polluters and battling developers.
Evenings once devoted to family are taken up with a steady agenda
of speaking engagements at civic clubs.
   Terry Backer, Long Island Sound fisherman, has become Terry
Backer, Long Island Soundkeeper, an officious title for a
$400-a-week job that carries no badge, no benefits and no illusions.
   ``I'm not naive enough to think that anything I do will have any
immediate effect. It's a long-term thing. I don't think I can
change the world. But I do need to start. We're talking about the
family farm.''
   The ``farm'' is 1,300 square miles of water rimmed by 570 miles
of coast, much of it gold, home to 5 million people.
   ``The population is constantly shifting to get closer to the
shoreline,'' says Michael Ludwig, a Connecticut-based ecologist
with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ``Easily
between 300 and 500 projects a year are proposed for Long Island
Sound. Even in this glutted market, it's still the most desirable
real estate in the world.''
   The man who keeps watch has an eighth-grade education, a bad
back, a wife, two young sons and a sense of urgency. He also has
``hands-on, feet-wet experience, and an intimate knowledge of Long
Island Sound,'' neither of which can be found in a textbook.
``Maybe the heart is more what this job needs than the book,''
Backer says.
   Maybe so, agreed the directors of the non-profit Long Island
Soundkeepers Fund, who chose him over college-educated applicants.
   ``He knows more about the water than most marine biologists we
deal with,'' says Robert F. Kennedy Jr., clinical professor at Pace
University School of Law and supervising attorney for the Hudson
River Fishermen's Association.
   ``Terry knows when there's stuff missing. He has seen species
disappear, acres of yield grass, smelt. He can say there used to be
blue crabs here but there aren't any more. He has an institutional
memory that goes back three generations.''
   Unlike many fishermen, who've accepted the sound's decline and
taken part-time jobs to supplement their income, ``Terry's never
accepted it,'' Kennedy says. ``He feels for the resource. He loves
it. And he's decided to make a stand and fight for it.''
   Making a stand often means making enemies. Backer's been called
everything from extortionist to ambulance-chaser by elected
officials throughout the region.
   ``He goes into town board meetings where everybody hates him,
the wealthiest people in these towns will be screaming at him, and
he'll state his arguments and fight with them,'' Kennedy says.
   ``Developers hate him because one of the big battles is against
shoreline development that requires marinas; marinas require
dredging, which Terry opposes. Municipalities hate him because he's
sued every municipality from New Haven to New York.''
   The suits were brought during his tenure as president of the
Connecticut Coastal Fishermen's Association, a group he co-founded
to help fishermen deal with regulatory agencies and polluters.
   The Soundkeepers Fund was established with proceeds from the
settlement of an association lawsuit against Norwalk in 1986, when
local oyster beds were closed due to sewage contamination.
   Publicity about contaminated shellfish beds ``is a double-edged
sword,'' says Stonington fisherman Joe Gilbert. ``On the one hand,
we need municipal and federal agencies to take note.''
   On the other hand, he says, such publicity causes sales to drop
immediately, even though ``pollution in one place doesn't mean
contaminated shellfish all up and down the coast.''
   Nonetheless, Gilbert approves of Backer's work. ``Terry's always
working to improve the lot of fishermen. He goes to a lot of
meetings, he speaks up, and he speaks for a lot of people.''

   Though he still manages to go oyster fishing, Backer's campaign
on behalf of the sound is a seven-day-a-week job. ``It's the house
I don't own, the novel I didn't write. It's the legacy I will leave
my children.''
   He is thickset and stocky, with Popeye biceps, unanchored
shirttail and a face that evokes a Connecticut autumn: sky-blue
eyes, wind-chapped skin and a chinful of reddish-gold scrub. A tiny
gold anchor pierces one earlobe, and a faded denim cap stained with
fish blood moors his hair.
   A self-described ``walking contradiction,'' he's a smoker who
worries about air quality; a fisherman who frequents a seafood
restaurant, then orders hot dogs for lunch.
   He's also a pollution fighter who objects to being called an
environmentalist, ``a word that conjures up images of kooks in
canoes, tree-huggers, liberals.''
   He prefers ``fisherman,'' and when asked why, cites King James:
``My God, it's a noble trade! It was the apostles' own calling.''
   ``There is something noble about being a fisherman, about
producing food for people to eat,'' Backer says.
   However, it was restlessness, not nobility, that led him to
choose his father's lobster boat over a high school education. He
also worked at a gas station, then set off at 16 to see the world.
   ``I picked crops in California, I logged in Oregon. To give you
an idea of the politicizing of Terry Backer, I once owned a T-shirt
that said, `Sierra Club: Kiss My Ax.' There is some confusion in
society about just what natural resources are for.''
   The T-shirt is long gone, as is any confusion on its owner's
part. ``The Earth is for everyone,'' Backer says.
   ``I'm not against progress. But if progress means water you
can't drink, plants you can't grow, fish you can't eat and air you
can't breathe, we need to redefine progress.''
   His effort on behalf of the sound began in earnest after a
fishing trip to Alaska in the early '70s. ``It was very beautiful _
as pristine as you can get. Then I came back here to work with my
father and one day, while looking over the side of the boat, I saw
that the place had really gone downhill. There were rafts of human
sewage floating downriver.
   ``Each generation leaves less behind. My grandfather didn't know
it could all be consumed, that it could be possible to dig out all
the marshes. How we got here is ignorance. How we stay here is
arrogance.''
   Backer's credentials as a fisherman help buttress his argument.
``He's not an ivory-tower environmentalist,'' Kennedy says. ``He
can be much more persuasive because he's able to say, `I've got a
family that may go hungry because you are discharging this stuff
into Long Island Sound and I want you to stop.' Or, `Because you
are dredging this shoal for your pleasure boat, I'm going to lose
income this year.'''
   ``The idea that environmentalists take jobs away from people is
still very prevalent,'' Backer says. ``We've become
supermarketized. Clean water and the first 6 inches of soil are
what keep us all going.
   ``People say that you can't compare worms and clams with people.
What I'm trying to tell them is that when the worms and the clams
go, we are not far behind.''
   He uses a donated 19-foot powerboat to look for things that
don't belong: dead fish, raw sewage, detergent foam, spewing pipes.
The boat is small for a reason. ``Most of the problems are right
around the edges,'' in shallow water. With 86 sewage treatment
plants all emptying into the sound, there's always something to
find.
   On this particular Sunday _ ``Sundays are good days to catch
people doing things they shouldn't be doing'' _ he finds a solvent
leaving a sheen on the surface of the Norwalk River.
   Backer frowns at the sight of a hen mallard dipping her bill
into a tiny oil slick, then follows the trail until the river
narrows, forcing him to turn back. He'll cover the rest of the
distance on foot.
   ``When I find something in the water, that's when the real work
begins.'' Tracking the culprit could take weeks. Much of the work
is done in the office, the second floor of an aging clapboard house
overlooking an inlet.
   A hand-lettered sign over the door says ``War Room.''
   ``It's considered good form for people involved in causes to say
things like, `There are no enemies here,''' Backer says. ``But
there is an enemy. The enemy is people, companies, municipalities.
Whoever puts that dollar ahead of the environment that's going to
sustain my kids, you're my enemy.''
   Far more battles take place in the hearing room than the
courtroom. ``Every problem doesn't need to be addressed with a
lawsuit,'' Backer says. ``If I can go to a community and talk to
people, write letters, or show up and do interviews with the local
newspapers, a lot of times that's all it takes to get people
thinking differently.
   ``Government works best when people participate. Without citizen
input, the guys in the $800 suits are going to get what they want
for the people they work for.''
   Though the battles continue, Backer believes he and the sound
already have won the war. ``What we've won is an awareness around
the area that someone is here, and someone is watching.''

   Isle Royale is a fascinating natural phenomenon
that has beckoned Indians before the birth of Christ and
archaeologists and biologists in modern times. The Indians mined
natural copper from the island. The scientists used it as an
insulated laboratory to study animal behavior. But now there is
trouble. One link in the balance of nature, the wolf, is dying out.

<TEXT>
   For 40 years, the wolves
and moose of Isle Royale have engaged in a macabre dance of
predator and prey before a fascinated audience of scientists and
summer campers.
   This island has been the site of one of the world's most intense
wildlife studies, neatly confined to an 8- by 45-mile laboratory
isolated in Lake Superior.
   Now the wolves are dying. No one knows why.
   Dr. Rolf Peterson, who for the past 19 years has been chief
researcher for the 31-year-old Isle Royale Project, fears there
will soon be a winter when he cannot find a single wolf on the
island, where more than 50 roamed a few years ago.
   Until 1988, the National Park Service dictated a policy of
non-interference with the wolves. While researchers elsewhere
captured the animals for blood tests and to attach radio collars,
on Isle Royale scientists learned what they could from aerial
surveys and by examining moose carcasses. Nobody under any
circumstances touched a wolf.
   ``This was one of the last really unmanipulated wolf populations
in the world,'' former park superintendent Jack Morehead said from
his office in Washington, where he is now is chief of operations
for the Park Service. ``These wolves were really a museum test
specimen of wolves in the wild.''
   Despite Morehead's objections, the Park Service last year gave
Peterson permission to collar the island's dwindling wolves.
   ``The line was crossed. Now we can never say these wolves have
never been touched by man,'' said Assistant Park Superintendent Tom
Ferranti on the island. ``Isle Royale is different for me now. I
feel a loss just knowing that.''
   Isle Royale is a rugged collection of high ridges plunging into
tangled swamps, a serrated edge of the earth rising out of Lake
Superior, 18 miles from Canada, the nearest mainland.
   The Indians called it Minong and traveled across open lake in
canoes to pry copper from the island's crevices. Today backpackers
alight from ferry boats.
   Isle Royale is teeming with moose, more than 1,600 at last
count. They were a waiting food supply when wolves from Canada
loped across the Lake Superior ice in what must have been 1949, the
winter the lake froze. They arrived unseen, nine years after the
island became a national park.
   Former park ranger Bob Hakala first confirmed there were wolves
on Isle Royale. It was November 1951. He and his wife were taking
one last hike up Feldtmann Ridge before snow closed the island and
sent them retreating to the Michigan mainland. In that first frost
of winter, he saw wolf tracks.
   Hakala also remembers the mournful sounds that came later.
   ``You figure you're hearing the call of the wild when you hear
that howl,'' he says. ``It has that sad quality.''
   That didn't stop a public relations campaign the next year to
stock Isle Royale with four wolves from a Detroit zoo. The pack
tore a housewife's laundry into strips, ate a fisherman's nets and
then stalked a tourist. Rangers shot two of them and deported a
third. The fourth, a black creature called Big Jim, escaped and
disappeared into island folklore.
   In 1958, Dr. Durward Allen of Purdue University arrived with his
doctoral candidates to begin one of the world's precursor studies
of wolf predation. There was precious little known about the wolf
and its prey.
   Thirty-one years of research since then have told science much
about the way wolves live, Allen says.

   ``These life communities are the most complex things we know
about in the whole universe,'' he said. ``We are only beginning to
unravel it.''
   When Peterson stepped in, he inherited a stable pack of about
two dozen wolves and a celebrated study that mapped the harmony of
nature.
   Something snapped the balance. The population exploded. By 1980,
Isle Royale had three wolf packs and 50 wolves. It was the highest
density of wolves recorded in the world.
   Just as suddenly, the wolves began dying. In 1981, 30 wolves
survived the winter. In 1982, the population was 14.
   In those two years, counting new generations born and lost,
Peterson figured 52 wolves died. He found six carcasses and no
conclusions.
   The survivors roamed at a nervous pace. Evidence suggested the
wolves were killing each other.
   Peterson didn't think it was anything more than an ordinary
population swing for several more years. But the wolves failed to
make the comeback he hypothesized.
   By 1988 there were just 12 animals left and the pups born each
year were too few to replace the dying elders. He persuaded the
Park Service to let him capture Isle Royale's wolves and take
action.
   Blood samples taken from four of the animals last year showed
three were exposed to Lyme disease, transmitted by infected ticks
and suspected of causing reproductive failure in wolves.
   The blood also showed two wolves were exposed to canine
parvovirus, a fatal disease of domestic dogs. No dogs are allowed
on Isle Royale but the Park Service suspects boaters sneak their
pets ashore.
   A third test showed the four wolves had look-alike genes, in
keeping with the theory the whole population comes from a single
female who colonized the island 40 years ago. Island inbreeding
could mean reduced fertility and the doom of the population. It
would not cause a population crash, Peterson thinks.
   ``The big unknown is, did disease cause the crash? Very likely
it did and we will never know,'' he said.
   The only theory Peterson can write off is starvation. There is
plenty of food.
   A faint odor wafted on the lake breeze when he returned to the
island last spring after a winter of teaching at Michigan
Technological University in Houghton. Carcasses of winter-starved
moose rotted in the warm air.
   Over the next few weeks, Peterson's field assistants found
dozens of dead moose, their legs tucked beneath them where they
died in the snow. There were more weak moose than wolves could
kill, more carcasses than wolves could scavenge.
   Meanwhile, the island's wolf population dropped to 11.
   The Park Service has not decided what to do. One proposal is to
simply let the wolves die without human intervention. But Isle
Royale without wolves could mean more moose, more starved moose.
   ``My own advice is just reintroduce wolves,'' Peterson says.
``Get with the program.''
   This summer, Peterson watched in frustration as the remaining
wolves abandoned their traditional rendezvous sites. There was no
cohesive pack, no evidence of denning, no promise of pups.
   Where were the animals? ``I haven't the foggiest,'' he said from
the fisherman's cabin where he keeps a graveyard of moose skeletons
out back and writes a eulogy for wolves within.
   Then unexpectedly in September, field assistant Joanne Thurber
saw something hopeful.
   She saw wolf pup tracks in the earth.

   Coal has long been one of Appalachia's most
valuable natural resources. But there's something else in those
hills that's coming into strong demand even as the coal industry
flounders. Water. Pure mountain mineral water. Bottled water has
become the fastest-growing segment of the beverage business.

   From smart shops in Tokyo to the White
House dinner table, water from the mineral springs of Appalachia
suddenly has cachet, and West Virginia bottlers are helping quench
the thirst of the health-conscious.
   Water straight out of these hills is just plain good and good
for you, they say.
   ``Out West, they look at West Virginia as a wild, untouched
area,'' says Tim Greider, managing director of Quibell Corp.,
bottler of the state's best-known mineral water. ``They aren't
concerned with pollution from West Virginia. We find that to be a
good selling factor.''
   Janet McMillion, co-owner of the smaller Nu-Mint Springs Co. in
Lindside, agrees.
   ``A lot of people in other states and different cities like New
York think West Virginia is wilderness,'' she says.
   Geary Campbell, spokeswoman for the International Bottled Water
Association in Alexandria, Va., says the $2 billion industry has
grown dramatically in recent years.
   ``We've seen over the past decade a growth of up to 500 percent
in sales,'' Campbell says. ``In 1988 alone, the bottled water
market grew by 14.9 percent in terms of sales, which was an
increase over all other beverage segments.''
   By far the most successful operation has been in rural Monroe
County, about 140 miles southeast of Charleston, where Quibell
captures 12,000 gallons of mineral water daily and trucks it 40
miles over Peters Mountain to Roanoke, Va. It is bottled and
shipped in Virginia.
   Greider's company has increased its profits by 250 percent since
August 1987 and has more than 200 distributors across the nation.
   The executive says bottled water is becoming more popular
because it's no longer a drink for just the well-to-do.
   ``People are concerned with what they consume. We're finding
that mineral water is becoming more mainstream to the American
public,'' Greider says. ``It's the fastest growing segment in the
beverage industry.''
   Quibell, which is sold throughout the United States, was the
first U.S. mineral water to be exported and can be found on store
shelves in Japan and the Middle East.
   Mineral water from West Virginia is even served to President
Bush and his guests, says Dennis Freemyer, an assistant usher at
the White House.
   There are eight companies in West Virginia bottling water and
officials say that number will grow.
   ``I certainly think it has a potential of becoming a fairly
sizable industry that could greatly contribute to the state
economy,'' says Ron Forren, director of the state's public health
and sanitation division, which oversees the bottling of mineral
water.
   Nu-Mint Springs is the latest West Virginia company to get into
the market, spending $400,000 for a water bottling plant in
southwestern Monroe County.
   ``It's going to pay off. This business is real profitable,''
McMillion says. ``It's providing jobs in the area. It's giving us
some self-esteem and southern West Virginia needs self-esteem.''
   Forren says West Virginia's large number of springs and heavy
concentration of limestone makes it a natural for producing mineral
water.
   ``The minerals in the springs and the bacteriological quality of
the water apparently make it just a good, sweet-tasting water that
individuals like,'' he says.
   Bill Clark, the Monroe County extension agent, says many of the
hundreds of springs located in his county have high-quality water.
   ``We have tested the water and you can almost advertise that it
has zero percent sodium, it's that low,'' Clark says. ``The good
things that water should have, it has in it.''
   California, Texas and Florida lead the nation in bottled water
consumption, averaging 19 gallons per capita per year, while the
national consumption rate is 6.4 gallons.
   Bill Deal, executive vice president of the bottled water
association, says production rankings for each state aren't
available.
   ``Right now it is still mainly regional, but certainly _
especially in the sparkling category _ more products are being
marketed nationally because they are primarily an alternative to
soft drinks and alcohol,'' Campbell says.

   America's growing numbers of homeless people
have problems more complex than the hobos of yesteryear. No longer
will just a meal and a bed get the job done, says one innovative
shelter director. The answer? In Denver, it's computers to the
rescue.

   The Denver Rescue Mission, the oldest relief
agency in the city, isn't interested in just feeding, clothing and
saving the souls of the down-and-out. It wants them to read, write
and understand computers, too. red-brick building with the blue ``Jesus
Saves'' sign
over the door, director Del Maxfield is trying to redefine the
goals of a shelter for t
   Inside thehe homeless as well as the needs of the men
who seek help there.
   The latest innovation is a computer-based program for
functionally illiterate adults. It is part of ``a new
sophistication of the old urban missions'' in response to changes
in the makeup of the growing homeless population in America,
Maxfield says.
   In the past, he says, shelters were thought to be doing their
job by providing a roof, a prayer and a meal for hobos and
alcoholics.
   The new homhelter's board chairman, Roy O. Howell, a retired
schoolteacher, and other volunteer educators began a tutoring
program to help the shelter's wards earn high school equivalency
diplomas.
   Then, a year ago, Maxfield visited Accelerated Christian
Education Inc. in Dallas to take a look at its computer-oriented
education courses for schools. He worked with ACE to develop
similar programs for adults, from the illiterate to those in need
of refresher courses. The resulting program began at the mission a
few months ago.
   The literacy and other programs are financed entirely by
donations, Maxfield says. In 1988, the Denver Rescue Mission
reported revenues of $717,000, all of it from donations and
interest. The shelter probably has invested at least $6,000 so far
in the literacy program, Maxfield says.
   Maxfield believes in taking the mission to the streets as well,
where the homeless live. He says many cannot leave their camps in
railroad yards or under viaducts because they are afraid of being
robbed. This doesn't faze Maxfield. He says he developed street
smarts at a previous job as chaplain in the Los Angeles County jail
system.
   The mission also has a truck that collects leftover food from
Denver-area supermarkets and drops it off in poor neighborhoods.
And it has a farm in northern Colorado where interested shelter
residents can get away from city pressures and help grow food for
the shelter.
   Now Maxfield is expanding the mission to include a shelter and
vocational training center for women in a building being renovated
nearby. It is scheduled to open in January.
   Maxfield hopes the computers ultimately will be used not only
for educational and vocational training but for personal
development. Such as?
   ``How to balance a checkbook,'' he said.

   In the Old West the fight was between the
cattlemen and the homesteaders, barbed wire vs. open range. In
today's West the terms are different, but the fight has a similar
ring. It pits developers with promises of riches against those who
chose to be there because they like it the way it is.

   Plans for a giant ski resort in this
pristine corner of America near the Canadian border have divided
the local residents as decidedly as the Methow River bisects the
magnificent valley.
   The conflict is not new in America. It involves 1,200 jobs and
economic growth for a depressed rural county on the one hand, and a
radically altered lifestyle for the Methow Valley on the other.
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision this summer helped pave the way
for construction of the $280 million Early Winters ski resort.
   There are still formidable environmental obstacles before
construction can begin, but the Supreme Court decision is the
biggest hurdle that the developers, Methow Recreation Inc., have
crossed. That has brought the 3,600-acre resort much closer to
reality.
   Washington lacks a major destination ski resort on the order of
Sun Valley, Aspen or Big Sky, and state officials have supported
the project as a way to keep ski dollars at home.
   ``There isn't a ski hill where you can stay with your family for
a week,'' says Cal Merriman, owner of the 20-room Mazama Country
Inn in the shadow of 6,088-foot Sandy Butte.
   Like other area business owners, Merriman expects the resort
business to spill over to his operation. But he is also aware of
the changes it would bring.
   A resort with accommodations for 7,000 would be a small city,
and would require services such as grocery stores, sewer systems
and streets, he says. ``The social structure of the valley would
change.''
   Linda Mills, an employee of Winthrop Mountain Sports, feels the
resort would give young people like herself more incentive to stay.
   ``A lot of kids who graduate leave the valley,'' she says.
``People don't make much money.''
   Okanogan County officials and many Methow Valley business people
are enthusiastic about increased tax and retail revenues, since the
resort would be one of the biggest employers in the sparsely
populated county of 30,000 residents.
   But there is little doubt a resort the magnitude of Early
Winters would significantly change the region.
   Home to just 3,600 full-time residents, the valley's depressed
economy depends on tourism, logging and the U.S. Forest Service.
Work is seasonal, wages are low and there is widespread
unemployment in the winter.
   ``Last summer I hired 10 people and kept two on in the winter,''
says Gene Walker, owner of Tenderfoot Inc., a general store in
Winthrop. ``There is 80 percent unemployment in the winter.''
   Walker supports the resort, as do many business owners along
Winthrop's Old West-style main street. Just 15 miles west of
Winthrop, which has 400 year-round residents, the resort would
likely be a major boost to an area that currently thrives only
during the summer travel season through nearby North Cascades
National Park.
   But the area is also home to an independent collection of
residents who came to escape urban pressures and are ekeing out a
living. To them, the remoteness and lack of opportunity are a
challenge.
   ``One reason people move to the Methow is it's really hard to
get by here,'' says Isabelle Spohn of Twisp, a member of the Methow
Valley Citizens Council, an environmental group that challenged the
resort in court.
   ``A lot of us could make lots more money in the city,'' says Ms.
Spohn, who commutes 100 miles a day to teach special education in
Brewster. ``We decided to make less money and live in a place we
like.''
   In addition to the evergreens, the wildflowers and the burbling
streams, the Methow Valley is wonderfully quirky.
   Hotels in Winthrop lack television sets and telephones, two
modern conveniences much desired by visitors.
   Area bookstores are heavily stocked with the classics.
   The Confluence Gallery in nearby Twisp (pop. 800) is currently
showing the ceramics and tapestries of Zeljko Kujundzic, and the
Twisp Pastries and Savories cafe next door serves wonderful scones
and strawberry muffins.
   The local theater group is putting on ``Oklahoma!''
   ``There is a lot of cultural diversity,'' says Pema Choki, an
organic herb farmer who also waits tables at the cafe.
   Like other resort opponents, Ms. Choki is concerned the resort
will ruin air and water quality, wildlife habitat and the pastoral
lifestyle of the valley.
   In the planning for two decades, Early Winters would transform
Sandy Butte in the Okanogan National Forest into a downhill ski
area, averaging 3,500 skiers a day, and at the bottom a golf course
and resort village with overnight accommodations for 7,000.
   It would easily be the largest community and largest job
generator in the valley.
   The Methow Valley Citizens Council, a grass-roots organization,
sued in 1985.
   A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals reinstated it, saying the Forest Service had to
come up with detailed measures to protect the valley's air quality,
mule deer herd and other environmental aspects.
   But the Supreme Court ruled on May 1 that additional
environmental impact studies were not required for the resort.
   Despite the Supreme Court victory, the developers still need to
obtain state permits and complete supplemental environmental impact
statements on issues not covered by the high court.
   Still, developers have said they hope to begin construction next
year.

   Carol Burnett says it was a ``hoot'' to
return to the theater of her childhood for her third special
musical appearance with Julie Andrews.
   The first was at Carnegie Hall in New York in 1962, the second
at New York's Lincoln Center in 1971. ``Julie and Carol: Together
Again,'' which ABC will televise on Wednesday, took them to the
Pantages Theater in Hollywood.
   ``That's four blocks from where I was raised,'' Burnett says.
``My grandmother and I occasionally went to movies at the Pantages.
It was still a movie theater then. They had a lot of premieres
there and I can remember standing behind the ropes and watching the
stars come in. So, it was a hoot to be on that stage.''
   Burnett and Andrews do a series of skits and songs for the
one-hour special.
   ``Julie and I, of all people, do a rap,'' Burnett says. ``I fell
down when she suggested it. Ken and Mitzie Welch wrote the rap song
for us. It's called `Mama's All Right' and it's us complaining
about the way adults are treated by teen-agers, usually their own
children.
   ``For Julie and I to do a rap was silly. Backstage, we called
ourselves `White Bread and Mayonnaise.'''
   They also do a send-up of ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' It's
called ``Phantom of the Opry'' and it's done as a country-western
number.
   ``Julie's a singer with hair as long as Crystal Gayle's,'' she
says. ``I'm an evil country-western singer with a twin sister
banished to the catacombs of the Opry. She's the phantom and wants
to make Julie the star.''
   Burnett is interviewed in her third-floor production office at
the Disney Studios, where she is making her new series for NBC,
``Carol &amp; Company.'' She points out the window to Glenda Jackson,
the current week's guest star, taking her lunch break outside.
   On one wall of the office is a large oil painting of Hollywood
as it might have appeared in the 1940s. She had the painting done
by Bruce Cohen.
   She puts a finger on one building and says, ``That's the
building where I lived with my grandmother. My friend Ilomae and I
would go on the roof and shout down the air shaft. People would
yell back, `You girls get out of there and stop that noise.'''
   Burnett has written of her early experiences in ``One More
Time.''
   Her new show for NBC probably will make its debut in the spring.
It will be her first regular television appearance in some time.
   She made her TV debut as Buddy Hackett's girlfriend on
``Stanley'' in 1956-57. The following year she was on ``Pantomime
Quiz,'' then spent three years on ``The Garry Moore Show,''
beginning in 1959. She co-starred on ``The Entertainers'' in
1964-65.
   ``The Carol Burnett Show'' ran on CBS from 1967 to 1978 and four
new shows were televised the following summer on ABC. She made
occasional appearances on ``Mama's Family,'' a spinoff of the show.
   Since then she has starred in such feature films as ``A
Wedding,'' ``Health,'' ``The Four Seasons'' and ``Annie'' and such
TV movies as ``Friendly Fire,'' ``The Tenth Month,'' ``Between
Friends'' and ``The Laundromat.''
   ``Julie and I met in 1960 when she came backstage to see me when
I was doing `Once Upon a Mattress,''' Burnett says. ``A mutual
friend had said we'd like each other and that usually puts you off.
We hit it off. We performed together on `The Garry Moore Show' and
we worked so well together the idea was born that we should do a
special.
   ``It was a hard sell at CBS. I was a second banana on Garry's
show. Julie was in `Camelot' and nobody west of New Jersey knew who
she was. She hadn't done `Mary Poppins' yet. We finally got it on
and the show won an Emmy and the Golden Rose Award at the Montreux
Film Festival.''
   Burnett and Andrews have never done a movie together, although
they've talked about it.
   Her new series, ``Carol &amp; Company,'' is a comedy anthology
conceived by Matt Williams, creator of ``Roseanne.'' The half-hour
episodes feature different characters each week and such guest
stars as Glenda Jackson, Nell Carter, Robert Guillaume and Howie
Mandel.
   ``The appeal to me was doing different characters,'' she says.
``I can't think of any character I'd want to do every week. A few
years ago I thought of doing something like this. Then after Disney
signed Matt Williams they called me to meet Matt. He had this idea;
I liked him, and what the heck.
   ``We do this before an audience, like variety, but it's much
harder. For me, anyway. On a variety show a sketch ran only seven
or eight minutes. If it didn't go over we could redeem ourselves
with a song or another sketch. This time it's the entire show.''

   Nathan Lane, who has finally won critical
acclaim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway hit, ``The Lisbon
Traviata,'' knows the pitfalls and pratfalls of an actor's struggle
upward.
   Lane thought his breakthrough into public recognition would come
with the play ``The Film Society,'' in which he played the lead, a
teacher in a private school in South Africa.
   But it had to wait for his present role, playing a hilariously
fanatic fan of diva Maria Callas, obsessed with hearing a pirated
recording of her singing ``La Traviata'' in Lisbon.
   Critics praised ``The Lisbon Traviata,'' now at the Promenade
Theater, and singled Lane out for their highest accolades.
   ``I've taken a big step in my career,'' Lane says. ``I feel
acceptance and respect. This sort of critical reception does have
an effect in the business.''
   Only 30 now, Lane began perfroming as a child.
   ``When I was in the sixth grade, we did a production of `Around
the World in 80 Days,' abbreviated, maybe 32 days,'' he says. ``I
played the servant to Phileas Fogg. They're being attacked by
Indians on a train. I went to hide. I was a chubby kid and I took a
little suitcase and crouched behind it. I was much larger than the
suitcase. It got a big laugh. ...
   ``It was like blood to a vampire. I thought, `This could be nice
to do.' I was bitten by the bug.''
   Lane was born in Jersey City, N.J., got a scholarship and
intended to go to college, but at the last minute took a job
touring the state in a musical about the history of New Jersey.
   He did dinner theater and summer stock.
   ``Eventually I moved to New York and starved,'' he says. ``I did
singing telegrams, sold TV Guide and cookbooks by phone, did
telephone polls. I called wheat farmers about what insecticide they
were using.''
   Lane did stand-up comedy with a partner. He was in ``One of the
Boys,'' a TV series that shot only 13 episodes, then got an
audition in 1982 for Noel Coward's ``Present Laughter'' directed by
and starring George C. Scott.
   ``It was the easiest audition I ever did,'' he says. ``Two days
later they called and said, `You got it.' I thought they'd get
somebody more established in the theater. It was my Broadway debut.
   ``No show since has gone as easily. George C. Scott was such a
gentleman, so great to me, like a father. If he'd asked me to jump
off the Brooklyn Bridge, I would have.''
   Asked whether scripts are pouring in now that ``The Lisbon
Traviata'' is a success, Lane says no, then amends it to, ``One
poured in today.''
   Director John Tillinger, who had directed Lane here in 1988 in
``The Film Society,'' suggested he be auditioned for the role of
Mendy in ``The Lisbon Traviata.''
   Lane, who considers himself a character actor not a comedian,
says: ``I love working with John. He's the first director in a long
time who thought of me in terms of more than just comedy.''
   Some people go to see ``The Lisbon Traviata'' without knowing
whether it's a comedy, tragedy, musical or drama, Lane says.
   ``It's a successful play,'' Lane says. ``If they aren't familiar
with the world they're going to enter, they're in for a big
surprise. The opera jokes are self-explanatory. Stephen says,
`Marilyn Horne sings like a truck driver.' I say, `Marilyn Horne IS
a truck driver. She was discovered driving a fork lift in a Los
Angeles gravel pit.'
   ``And after the initial realization that all the characters are
gay, the play becomes very universal.
   ``Slowly you realize it is about the fear of getting older and
of being alone and feeling so desperate about that you'd rather
kill your lover than let him leave you.
   ``I think it's a brave play, because it deliberately turns dark
in the second act,'' Lane says. ``By the end of the first act, you
see the darkness coming and the pain an sadness that is there, if
you're really paying attention. Some people feel cheated; they
thought it was just going to be laughs.
   ``People have walked out. It gets very frank. The moment of
nudity is not gratuitous. For Stephen to go home and see a nude,
young man there is meant to be shocking.''
   Older men and women whom one would expect to be put off by the
sexual frankness seem to respond to the play more than anyone, Lane
says. One older man told him: ``This was an old-fashioned drama
told in a whole new way. This is the most moving experience I've
had in the theater in 20 years.''

   While big-buck movies crowd into the nation's theaters during
the holiday season, a number of smaller, worthy films face the
danger of being pushed out of the marketplace.
   Among them: ``Henry V,'' a daring new version by Kenneth
Brannagh; ``Staying Together,'' Lee Grant's warm study of a small
town family in trouble; ``My Left Foot,'' an inspiring tale of
human survival with an electrifying performance by Daniel
Day-Lewis; ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' grownup Matt Dillon in a highly
original film about druggies in 1970 Portland, Ore.
   Add to the list ``True Love.''
   Amazingly, it was filmed for less than $1 million. But ``True
Love'' has far more heart and humanity than today's bloated sequels
and star ego trips _ notably the noxious ``Harlem Nights.''
   The movie contains no recognizable names or faces. Nor does it
boast a high concept plot. Its fascination lies in its
high-spirited acting and verisimilitude to Italian-American life in
the Bronx.
   Director Nancy Savoca and her husband and co-producer, Richard
Guay, have written a script centering on the rituals of a
traditional wedding. The bride (Annabella Sciorra) frets over why
she is marrying Michael (Ron Eldard). He is unreliable, immature
and selfish.
   His qualms are just as severe. He enjoys his life of freedom, of
being able to hang out with the boys whenever he wants. Why take on
the hassle and responsibility of marriage?
   Their doubts and fears continue right up to the wedding night,
which he wants to spend with his chums. It's hard to imagine
anything so dumb, but that's about the only disparity in the film.
   As a director-writer, Nancy Savoca has a marvelous eye for
detail and human touches. The interplay among the males and
especially among the females (Are women so profane among
themselves?) is carefully drawn and exploited for all its humor.
   She also makes her actors look as if they weren't acting. Both
Sciorra and Eldard show sparks of star quality.
   ``True Love'' is getting a desultory release by MGM-UA and
deserves time to find its audience.
   Rated R for language. Running time: 1 hour, 4 minutes.

   ``Ballet Music by Giuseppe Verdi'' (London) _ Orchestra del
Teatro Comunale di Bologna, conducted by Riccardo Chailly
   
   If not for anything else, we should thank the French for
insisting on ballets in their operas. Verdi wrote seven for his
stage works performed in Paris, and these ``divertissements''
contain some beautiful music and an infrequent example of non-vocal
Verdi.
   Oboe, clarinet or violin often sings the melody over the usual
bouncing accompanying figures. The score has moments of highly
charged drama, and the orchestration is always superb.
   Chailly induces this somewhat rough-edged orchestra to give
rhythmically taut, high-spirited and at times exciting
performances. The band has its high spots, but an unfortunate
number of low ones _ bad intonation in the brass, blurry strings
and loose-knit pizzicati.
   The pieces are drawn from ``Macbeth,'' ``I vespri Siciliani,''
``Don Carlos,'' ``Aida'' and ``Otello.''

   ``We Too Are One'' (Arista) _ Eurythmics
   
   Once the darlings of post-modern, synth-pop enthusiasts, Dave
Stewart and Annie Lennox have at last begun to speak to all of us.
   Their hard-edged ``We Too Are One'' builds on a more
guitar-heavy rhythm and blues sound and sticks with lyrics rooted
in a strong sense of self-worth. Lennox plays the jilted woman in
the powerful lead single ``Don't Ask Me Why,'' and the brutal ``You
Hurt Me (And I Hate You).'' She sounds nasty and unforgiving, but
only because a man pushed her too far and she knows she's too good
for that.
   In the sharply critical ``The King and Queen of America,''
Lennox and Stewart comment on arrogant, phony political figures who
exploit people with empty promises, people who ``never did anything
_ to make ourselves feel proud.''
   The real highlights on ``We Too Are One'' come in its ballads.
Lennox laments the death of her father and grieves over her recent
miscarriage in ``Angel,'' a poignant comment on the sadness of
death and the hope of a better life in the netherworld.
   The hymn-like ``When the Day Goes Down'' is dedicated to the
less fortunate and downtrodden, telling them, ``all God's children
are beautiful and pure _ and you're as good as all of them.''
Lennox's rich alto caresses the words, lending them a genuine
sincerity, as Stewart's guitar weaves a gentle background.
   Nowadays, Lennox and Stewart write songs that are modern without
being threatening. ``We Too Are One'' seems more listener-friendly
than some of their previous eight albums. It won't scare away
aficionados of other types of music. Quite an accomplishment.

   Masterworks in the permanent collection at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Houston are featured in the institution's first full-color
publication, ``A Permanent Legacy.''
   Published by Hudson Hills books, the 352-page work presents 150
full-page colorplates of works by the world's greatest artists,
including Renoir, Degas, van Gogh, Picasso, O'Keeffe, Matisse,
Sargent, Cezanne and Cassatt.
   ``During the 1980s, the museum has expanded to serve the varied
and complex demands of a major cosmopolitan city,'' said Peter C.
Marzio, the museum's director. ``As the museum has become a
cultural hub for the community, the need to document and celebrate
the collection has become apparent.''
   The museum's permanent collection contains more than 24,000
works of the Renaissance, English and early American decorative
arts, late 19th and 20th century European and American art and
photography. There is also Near and Far Eastern art, tribal arts
and ancient and early European art.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Season of Olympia Dukakis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This seems to be the season of the Olympia
Dukakis Film Festival, since the Academy Award winner is
simultaneously appearing in three major productions.
   ``It seems that way,'' she comments with a throaty laugh, ``but
actually, it's a coincidence. These films, which have been done
over the past 2{ years, just happened to be coming out at the same
time.''
   They are: ``Look Who's Talking,'' as the nagging mother of
Kirstie Alley; ``Steel Magnolias,'' as a sardonic widow in the
small-town comedy drama crowded with stars; and ``Dad,'' as the
overbearing wife of Jack Lemmon and mother of Ted Danson.
   The trio may seem like a bountiful harvest from her warmly
applauded win of the supporting actress Oscar for ``Moonstruck''
earlier this year. But all were in the works before that happy
event.
   The actress was here for ``Steel Magnolia'' festivities, and she
appears in an interview as she does on the screen: warm, worldly
wise and intelligent. The Oscar seems to have changed her not at
all. She's still the same Olympia Dukakis who did such a fine
selling job as Aunt Millie in the spaghetti sauce commercials.
   ``Steel Magnolias'' threw six volatile actresses together in a
small Southern town, a potentially explosive situation. But Olympia
said she and her co-stars _ Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine, Dolly
Parton, Daryl Hannah, Julia Roberts _ had a ball.
   ``Sometimes it was very raucous, and lewd and lascivious,'' she
chuckled. ``We had a lot of fun together, bawdy. At other times it
was very reflective, philosophical. We discussed life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.
   ``It was really a very nice time of coming together, the best of
what happens when women are together. Strongly supportive and
conciliatory, nurturing, caring.
   ``No temperament. Everyone seemed to like their characters a
lot. You felt that everyone around you was really on target.''
   It was different on ``Moonstruck,'' she reflected, recalling
when two of the actors had a blowup and in the scuffle she had
coffee spilled on her. But she agreed the incident might have
derived from the Italian nature of the movie.
   In ``Steel Magnolias,'' Dukakis was able to play her own age,
meaning 50ish. For ``Dad'' she had to endure two hours in the
makeup chair as latex was applied to age her 15 to 20 years.
   ``The makeup helped to assume the age,'' she said. ``Also the
clothes were specifically and carefully worked out. The length of
the sleeves, the pants so that the bones showed, the hump in the
back, the jewels oversized, the pocketbook a little too big. There
was a kind of physical tightness about her that matched her
feelings.''
   Her opinion of Lemmon: ``A very serious actor. I say that
because having seen him in movies being so funny and carefree and
bouncing off walls, then to meet him and see how seriously he takes
his work. ... It's not that he didn't joke and kid off the set. But
he was very concentrated on his work.''
   The actress was as surprised as anyone when ``Look Who's
Talking'' went through the roof (No. 1 at the box office five weeks
in a row, $85 million in 38 days).
   ``I'm so happy for (director) Amy Heckerling, and Kirstie and
John (Travolta),'' she said. ``I have to admit that I never thought
it would have this kind of popularity. I thought it was well done,
and Amy Heckerling has a nice way with actors. There was a nice
feeling on the set, a kind of freedom to work and move around. At
the same time you feel she sets boundaries. So it's a nice working
situation.''
   Olympia Dukakis is a late starter in the business. Born to
Greek-born parents in Lowell, Mass., she grew up in the same
political ferment that produced her cousin, Michael, the
Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate. After graduating
from Boston College, she worked as a physical therapist, then
returned to college to study theater arts.
   She worked in a Boston regional theater, then moved to New York
at the age of 29 with her actor-husband Louis Zorich. She taught at
New York University while playing in soap operas and off-Broadway.
This might have been the story of her career except for a series of
events that started six years ago.
   ``I did a Christopher Durang play, `The Marriage of Bette and
Boo,' that Nora Ephron saw,'' the actress related. ``She
recommended me to Mike Nichols for `Heartburn.' I played Meryl
Streep's mother and was eventually cut out of the film. He cast me
in the play `Social Security,' which ran for quite a while. Norman
Jewison saw me in that and put me in `Moonstruck.'''
   And what has been the result of her Oscar win?
   ``We no longer have a mortgage,'' she said with a laugh. She and
her husband live in 100-year-old house in Montclair, N.J.

<HEAD>The Artists: A Hero and a Friend</HEAD>

   If a man can't be a hero to his valet, can a
pianist be a hero to the technician who tunes his piano?
   Yes, both a hero and a friend, says Franz Mohr about the late
Vladimir Horowitz.
   Mohr, chief concert technician at Steinway &amp; Sons, accompanied
the pianist to performances that included his heralded comeback at
Carnegie Hall in 1965, his 1986 Moscow concert and two appearances
at the White House.
   He last saw Horowitz four days before he died, during a
Wednesday session for a new recording at Horowitz's Manhattan home.
When Mohr arrived Friday for another session, he was told that
Horowitz had practiced for half an hour but didn't feel well. The
pianist died suddenly Nov. 5 while discussing with his wife, Wanda,
a menu for that night's dinner to which they had invited pianist
Murray Perahia.
   ``Horowitz was in a class by himself,'' Mohr said. ``He had
tremendous command when it comes to technique. Many young artists
have technique today, too. But nobody has such a wide range of
color like Horowitz. He had from a super-fortissimo to a
super-pianissimo so soft it hardly exists. When he played his last
European tour, in 1987, he played Liszt's `Consolation' with such
command it made you cry.
   ``He played dangerously in a way, in his phrasing and his
tempos, almost many times to the breaking point but never over it.
He had such clarity. In fast passages you heard every note. Many
pianists smear through. Even now, at 86 ... he was tremendous.
Listen to his last record, `Horowitz at Home.' Unbelievable.''
   They were friends, too, Mohr said. ``Many times I'm invited for
dinner after a concert. We had the Horowitzes for dinner at our
home. They appreciated my family very much. I have two boys in the
piano business, in leading positions I would say. My daughter is
getting married in February. Wanda said they would come.
   ``Wanda was the best critic for him. He listened to her. She is
profound and knows music. My wife and I love her, too.''
   Horowitz's own piano, a wedding gift when he married Wanda
Toscanini in 1933, was moved from his home to the basement of the
Steinway showroom three years ago. His last recording was done on a
new piano from Steinway.
   Gesturing to Horowitz's piano, which he always took with him on
tours, Mohr said: ``He was planning to take this piano again on
tour. I prepared it for him. He was coming in this week to look at
it. He said soon he would play in Berlin, Hamburg and Amsterdam,
maybe Leningrad.''
   Asked whether Horowitz was even-tempered or volatile, Mohr said:
``I would say that being such a genius, as he really was, a man of
his caliber would change emotionally hour by hour. You see it in
his playing. He never played the same piece the same way.
   ``Of course he could blow up or get excited on the spur of a
moment that some little thing is not just right. That can happen
but it is understandable.
   ``For a technician, he was very easy to work with, because he
was consistent in what he did. He always had his rehearsal at 4
p.m. Saturday and his concert at 4 Sunday. He never practiced the
day of the concert. He said if he didn't know the piece the day
before, he shouldn't play it.''
   Mohr has traveled with pianists, some of them famous, who played
every day, on whatever piano was available and often practiced so
close to the time of the concert that he had no time to prepare the
piano.
   ``Tuning is extremely important,'' he said. ``An action has more
than 10,000 parts, consisting of wood and felt, therefore subject
to changes in humidity. You have constantly to check the regulation
of the instrument, especially a piano which travels. In Russia I
had two sets of tools with me, plus quite a few parts, like
strings.''
   Mohr is nervous only for the first few bars. Then, when he hears
the piano sounding all right, he relaxes and enjoys the music.
   He started his music career in performance, studying violin in
his native Germany. ``I had problems with my left wrist. I came to
the painful conclusion I couldn't pursue a musical career. I was
already 22 when I went into this (tuning). I worked my way through
the factory.'' Some technicians shrink from contact with musicians
but Mohr relishes it.
   Steinway moved him to New York in 1962. ``My predecessor was
Bill Hupfer. He was a legend. He had traveled all his life with
Rachmaninoff. When he retired, I took over as chief concert
technician.''
   Mohr recalled one Horowitz incident with a smile: ``He made me
pretty famous. When he played in Berlin, it was a tremendous
success. I came home on Monday. He called me, `You have to come
back. I play a second concert.' He said to the press in Berlin, `If
Franz doesn't come back, there won't be any second concert.' It
ended up on TV and all of that.''

   He grew up in basketball-crazed Indiana and
the irony wasn't lost on Henry Lee Summer.
   Here he was, cooling off in the basketball locker room at
Arizona State's University Activity Center, wearing his favorite,
black hightop sneakers with the cheers of the crowd still ringing
in his ears.
   But on this late September night, people didn't come to watch
Summer play hoops in a charity pickup game. The fans paid big bucks
to see him do what he really does for a living _ sing.
   ``Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be involved in music,''
said Summer in a backstage interview. ``I started out singing at
age 3 or 4 in a church choir. I knew I could sing, and when I did
people reacted differently than when other people sang.
   ``It wasn't that I had a better voice than everybody else. I
just know that when I do sing and I'm feeling what I'm singing,
people can feel it, too. I love to get people excited. I noticed
that real early on and got into it, even as a kid. There's a fine
line between church and rock 'n' roll, anyway. They're both dealing
with the human spirit.''
   Summer, now 34, is touring the country to promote his second
album for CBS Records called ``I've Got Everything.''
   The LP, released in May, has sold about 400,000 copies and is
closing in on gold status thanks to the hit single ``Hey Baby.''
   His self-titled debut album for the label last year had the Top
20 hit ``I Wish I Had a Girl,'' but peaked at ``around
300,000-something'' in sales, according to Summer.
   ``I wasn't happy with the way that album came out, but it wasn't
the producer's fault,'' said Summer, who writes and arranges his
own songs and plays both acoustic guitar and keyboards. ``I don't
like doing things more than once. In the studio, you do things over
and over and over and over. I only want to do it once and that's
it.''
   Summer's new LP, which he produced himself, was recorded at
``Henry's House of Noise'' _ his home in Indianapolis.
   ``There was equipment everywhere except the bedroom,'' he said.
``We miked the guitars in the kitchen, had the drums in the garage
and put the mixing board in my living room. I just wanted things to
sound live and most of the songs were done in one take.
   ``I was comfortable in my house and could sing whenever I felt
like it, as opposed to being on a schedule. I used my band and
three people from John Cougar Mellencamp's band (guitarist Mike
Wanchic, bassist Toby Myers and violinst Lisa Germano). We recorded
everything like a band and the vibe was right. When it wasn't
happening, we went and played basketball.''
   The lanky, 6-foot-3 Summer grew up as Henry Lee Swartz in the
small, farming community of Brazil, Ind. (population 5,000), where
he first sang at the Church of the Nazarene.
   He was a good enough high school guard to earn a full basketball
scholarship to Western Wyoming Junior College, but dropped out
after one year.
   ``I was a big fish in a small pond. But that was the first time
basketball started getting in the way of music,'' Summer said. ``I
remember missing half the games. I was in bands and it was either
go to the gigs or go to the away games.''
   Summer, self-taught on drums, guitar and piano, headed to
Jackson, Miss., where he perfected his husky vocals in nightclubs
and learned roadhouse rhythm and blues plus fatback Southern boogie.
   He returned to Indiana in the early 1980s and released four
singles and two albums on local, independent labels in 1982-86
before being signed by CBS in October 1986.
   By then, he was already known as Henry Lee Summer.
   ``I started going by that 15 years ago,'' he said. ``I was in
band called The Summer, so that's where the name came from. I got
my first band together when I was 11. I've been in a million bands
since then.''
   Summer and his current six-piece band have opened for Eddie
Money, Stevie Ray Vaughn and the Doobie Brothers this year, and
currently are on Richard Marx's tour.
   On the road, he often drives himself in a mini-van behind the
band's bus and writes his melodies by humming into a tape machine
on the seat next to him.
   Most of his latest songs are love ballads such as ``Something Is
Missing,'' and ``What's a Poor Boy to Do.'' But he promises ``more
up-tempo stuff'' for his next album.
   Summer has three tracks ready, including the song ``Low Flying
Man'' that he is testing out on the road with favorable reaction.
   His shows usually end with a standing ovation after a few
encores.
   ``I've always known that I had something to say musically. I
know when I'm playing live, a lot of people can relate to what I'm
singing,'' Summer said. ``I doubt that I'll be the next Bruce
Springsteen. But I think I'll be able to keep making records and
reach a level. Maybe not platinum. If I can turn out gold records,
that would be good enough for me.''

<HEAD>Elderly Recluse Froze to Death; Brother Charged</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Everyone in town knew of Anna Krampitz, a
deaf recluse who lived in a rundown white house next to a car
dealership. They'd see her on frequent walks to the Bixby Memorial
Free Library, where she would check out teen-age romance novels.
She never married, never held a job.
   That's about all most folks know of her life, but many know of
her death.
   Anna Krampitz was found frozen to death, alone, in the house in
which she was born 82 years ago _ a home with no running water, no
central heat and just a coal stove to warm the single room in which
she lived.
   Her 69-year-old brother, Theodore, was charged with neglect of
the elderly. Krampitz was his sister's legal guardian and the state
says he is responsible for the conditions in which she was living.
He has pleaded innocent and won't talk about the case. Trial has
been delayed indefinitely.
   ``I think most folks are afraid of dying by themselves,'' said
Michael Jackman of Miller Chevrolet Co. Inc., the business next
door to Anna's house at 20 Main Street. ``I don't know if that
could be true of Anna Krampitz.''
   Community efforts to reach out to her simply failed, some
neighbors say. City Clerk Joan Devine recalled that one Christmas a
Boy Scout troop wanted to take her a holiday basket. She threw the
contents across her battered porch.
   It seems many folks have their own Anna Krampitz stories.
   On several occasions, Jackman said, she dumped leaves and
shrubbery on cars parked alongside her home. Maybe she didn't like
their color, he said. A barbed-wire fence was erected between the
dealership and the house.
   Conditions were a surprise ``and we were right next door.
Nowadays, something like that, in a little country town, you don't
expect that to happen,'' he said.
   But authorities say Theodore Krampitz knew how his sister was
living.
   In a 1985 letter to the city arguing that a $30,200 appraisal on
the house was too high, he wrote: ``The house has no running water
due to the pipes and plumbing all freezing up and breaking
everything. There is no kitchen as such, no electricy (sic) in the
upper part of the house...The roof leaked badly in the past and the
plaster is off the ceilings and walls in most of the house. The
windows and the outside of the house is allin (sic) bad need of
repair, but I:m (sic) nN he position ot (sic) spend 20,000 to
repair the old place under present circumstances with my sister in
there.''
   The appraisal was lowered to $24,400, according to court
documents.
   Because there was no plumbing, Krampitz took his sister water in
jugs, court records said. When Vermont State Police Detective Sgt.
Bernard Chartier asked if he had considered getting the plumbing
fixed, Krampitz said, ``No chance _ cause it would just get ruined
in no time at all.''
   Chartier wrote in an affidavit that there was a three-foot pile
of human waste in a room that used to be the kitchen. Vergennes
police Sgt. John Dugan said it was so cold in the house he couldn't
even smell it.
   Dugan also recalls the books found all over the house _ even the
bathtub was full of them. And there was Krampitz's diary, in which
she noted holidays and made detailed entries about the weather.
   The last entry was Dec. 9, 1988. Her body was found 10 days
later.
   The Department of Social Welfare provided fuel assistance
checks, and some of that money cannot be accounted for, Chartier
wrote.
   Few people admit knowing Anna Krampitz well, and those who did
declined to talk about her. But one librarian made a face when told
that others in town had said Kramptiz was crabby. She looked away
and murmured it simply wasn't true.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, said, ``I'm aware
that she was an unfriendly old bird,'' but ``the purpose of having
a guardianship of someone is because they're unable to take care of
themselves.''
   Some 500,000 elderly Americans are believed to be under
guardianship, judged unable to care for themselves or their
finances and made wards of the court. This strips the wards of
control over their lives, including where they can live, what
medical treatment they receive and how their money is spent.
   Quinn believes the case has done a great deal to raise awareness
about elder abuse. ``Perhaps probate judges may not have as high a
good faith assumption now that they might have had in the past,''
he said.
   One in 25 older adults is abused, according to an estimate in a
1985 report to Congress, ``Elder Abuse: A National Disgrace.'' The
abuse takes all forms: psychological and physical torment, neglect
and theft.
   The Krampitz case ``made every public official ... more aware of
these kinds of conditions,'' said City Manager and health officer
Mel Hawley, adding he didn't realize the conditions but he's not
certain what he could have done. ``Anna was left in the care of her
brother. There it is. I'm not proud of this situation. I don't
think I'm responsible. (But) I'm a part of this community.''
   Hawley wondered what would have happened had he kicked Krampitz
out of the house. ``I just wonder what the editorial would have
been.''
   ``It has opened the city's eyes, A lot of these things you're
not aware of until something happens. And then you say, `Oh, my
goodness,''' Devine said.
   ``I feel awfully bad about this one,'' said Probate Court Judge
Catherine Fitzpatrick, who supervised Anna Krampitz's guardianship.
``I was asked by an agency, `Do you think you've got any more?' I
mean what can I say. I hope not. I'd hate to think anyone else is
out there in this position.''
   When Anna Krampitz died, she had no resources to draw on. The
state paid $885 to bury her. Prospect Cemetery caretaker Norman
Rheaume erected a simple wooden cross near the family monument to
mark her grave.
   Vergennes United Methodist Minister Rev. Paul Andersen-Crowder
remembered the stark burial attended only by Theodore Krampitz, his
wife and funeral home workers. Afterward, Krampitz told him, ``I'm
glad it's over.''
   ``It was an unsettling kind of thing,'' said Andersen-Crowder.
``I felt a certain amount of guilt. I felt like we as a community
really let her down.''

<HEAD>Innovative Volunteer Credit Program Helps Elderly, Disabled</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CATHERINE WILSON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Cassie Brown cooks breakfast and lunch for Josh
Thomas every other day when he's not on dialysis, and does laundry
for his grandmother.
   ``I understand elderly people because I'm 63 years old and I
have an older father, too. He's 90,'' said Ms. Brown, a team leader
with the Greater Miami Service Credit Consortium, a volunteer
program for the elderly and disabled.
   She collects one service credit for each hour she volunteers.
Working three to five hours a day, she takes clients to doctor's
appointments, fixes meals and runs errands. She can save the
credits for herself or donate them.
   ``It's kind of like insurance. The best kind is the kind you
never have to use,'' said a volunteer in Missouri. Other states
with programs are California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma and the District of
Columbia. Only in Michigan and Missouri are they statewide.
   Service credit programs, operating much like barter banks, are
run by groups ranging from a health maintenance organization
serving Hassidic Jewish and Italian communities in New York City to
the Area Agency on Aging in San Francisco's Mission District.
   Volunteers are most commonly used for respite care, giving a
break to the person with the primary responsibility for a sick or
disabled relative. Federal studies show families provide about 80
percent of care to the ailing elderly.
   Service credits ``can be used to target specific needs that are
a public priority,'' said Edgar Kahn, a Florida International
University professor and head of the project at the Southeast
Florida Center on Aging.
   Kahn, a speechwriter for then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy
and later for Sargent Shriver in the War on Poverty, devised the
idea of service credits nine years ago while teaching law at the
University of Miami. He worked out the economic implications during
six months at the London School of Economics.
   ``The purchasing power of a service credit may or may not be
that important, but just accruing them seems to make people feel
better,'' he said.
   In Missouri, 26 agencies from churches to hospices and
neighborhood groups send service-credit volunteers to play
checkers, read, go for walks and write letters but not get involved
in household chores, bathing or medical services.
   In Miami, 515 volunteers are working up to 6,000 hours a month,
mostly performing services that were never done before and are not
funded by Medicare or other federal programs. The average age of
volunteers in a program run by the HMO in the New York City borough
of Brooklyn is about 75.
   Credits are recorded, usually on a computer, and monthly or
quarterly statements may be mailed, given at meetings or on the
phone.
   ``The beauty of it is that it says everybody's time is valuable.
We just can't put people on the scrap heap,'' said Kahn. ``I think
we're really talking about a redefinition of the roles of the
market economy and what it does well and the non-market economy and
what it does well.''
   Pressure on the government to provide more services can be
resolved with service credit programs at little or no cost, said
Kahn, who also helped write the blueprint for the Legal Services
program, led an American Bar Association citizens watchdog group
that produced a pioneering report on hunger in America, and served
as special counsel to the chairman of the Navajo tribe.
   The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation invested $1.2 million in six
groups as a test of the concept. Miami is in the second year of its
three-year grant.
   ``The programs are feeling that they're riding a crest now, that
everybody feels the money isn't there to solve social problems so
there's got to be another solution,'' Kahn said.
   The mobility of the American family also played a role in his
thinking. ``It fills a critical gap in a community where we live as
strangers'' by giving a way for people to help. ``If this didn't go
on, neighbors could live next to each other in abject need with no
mechanism to bring them together.''
   ``We are not attempting to reinvent the volunteer services,''
said Eric Berry, of Michigan's Volunteer Incentive Service Credit
Accounting Program.
   ``Our programs are asked to network with the existing volunteer
programs, so if we are alerted to a caregiver at such and such an
address, if there is a church group that already has volunteers
available, that volunteer receives the service credits.''
   Michigan, which offered its first services in January, has
recruited young volunteers who can offer their credits to
grandparents as Christmas or birthday presents. Miami is working
with schools to recruit teen-age volunteers.

   It sounded more like a kennel than a corporate
lunchroom, but despite all the yelping, yapping and leash-tangling
going on, the luncheon for the Pets for People Program went
remarkably well.
   ``I was pleasantly surprised. We didn't have any `incidents' at
all,'' said Kathryn B. Wright, director of the Ralston Purina
nationwide pet adoption program that pairs senior citizens with
homeless dogs and cats.
   The potential was there, to be sure. But the lone cat went
mostly unnoticed and trained dog handlers were on hand in case of
trouble.
   ``I've been to all kinds of parties,'' said one guest who
attended with his adopted dog. ``But this is the first time I've
been to a dog party.''
   The recent party was the kickoff for the third year of the
program that has matched people with nearly 25,000 pets from 180
participating shelters. Hosts were actresses June Lockhart, of
``Lassie'' fame, and Audrey Meadows, best known for her role as
Alice Kramden on ``The Honeymooners.''
   ``Pet-owning seniors are healthier and happier,'' Meadows said.
``But no one needs to tell you how they've changed your life.''
   ``We're very pleased with the success of the program,'' Wright
said. ``We've had a positive impact on two seemingly unrelated
problems, pet overpopulation and our nation's lonely senior
citizens.''
   The benefits of pet companionship has yet to be fully
documented, but it's clear pets can provide affection,
entertainment and companionship.
   A recent survey of 900 adopters found that 92 percent felt less
lonely, 91 percent were happier, 80 percent felt less stress and 69
percent thought they were healthier as a result of owning a pet.
Caring for pets gave many adopters a feeling of being needed and
even a reason to exercise. For some, it provided a source of
conversation and an avenue for new friendships.
   Angel has certainly made a difference in Gertrude Knollhoff's
life. Knollhoff, 87, was honored at the luncheon with a special
prize for being the oldest adopter. Angel _ part schnauzer, part
poodle _ accompanied her.
   ``She's my alarm clock at seven in the morning,'' Knollhoff
said, giving the little dog a hug. ``I'd sleep all day if it wasn't
for her.''
   Nearby, a tablecloth hid all but the head of a large collie
named Coty, whose chin rested on Josephine Ardrey's knee. Ardrey
said she adopted Coty from a shelter because of her niece's
concerns about her living alone at age 85.
   ``Everybody was walking right by Coty,'' she said, patting his
head. ``Nobody wanted him _ they said he was too big. But he turned
out to be a good dog. I wouldn't give him up for nothing.''
   Hester and Herbert Bryan had always owned dogs, so when their
last pet grew old and sick and had to be put to sleep, they soon
adopted another one.
   ``I told them we didn't want a little lap dog, so they gave us a
big lap dog,'' said Mrs. Bryan, pointing to Buddy, a golden
retriever at her feet.
   Dan Bryan said Buddy eased his concerns about his parents, who
are both in their 80s. ``My dad was in the hospital and Buddy kept
my mom company while he was gone. He laid right by the door and
barked when anyone came. We didn't even know he could bark until
then.''
   Pets for People is a non-profit organization financed through
the purchase of Purina products. For every dog or cat adopted, it
gives $100 to the shelter to cover the adoption fee, inoculations
and spaying or neutering. The adopters also receive a pet-care
starter set with a collar, leash, bowls and food.
   Any person over 60 can apply. Participating animal shelters help
evaluate applicants and help them choose compatible pets.
   ``I just can't say enough about it,'' said Nancy Grove, the
executive director of the Animal Protective Associaton of Missouri.
``I think the idea of taking older animals out of the shelter _ the
very ones who don't get adopted as often _ and making them special
to other people is what it's all about.
   ``We've often had older people come in and ask us if they could
get a dog for free, and up until now, we were unable to afford
that.''

<HEAD>Families Alone Can't Bear Growing Burden of Caregiving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With America's older population growing and
women entering the workforce in record numbers, families alone will
not be able to handle their long-term care needs, business and
government experts agree.
   Caring for an aged relative can be a ``treasured time of
sharing'' for many, but competing family and career demands can
make it ``a time of pain, struggle and exhaustion that may stretch
to the breaking point their capacity to care,'' Lou Glasse,
president of the Older Women's League, said at a recent
congressional forum on ``eldercare.''
   ``Without help for family caregivers, the only alternative for
the elderly may be a nursing home. By helping prevent caregiver
burnout, we enable families to continue caring for their elderly
members,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a forum sponsor.
   The American Association of Retired Persons found in 1987 that
nearly 7 million Americans spent 10-12 hours a week providing care
to older people. More than half also worked outside the home and
almost one-third cared for children.
   As the population ages, the probability is overwhelming that
virtually every American will become a caregiver, according to AARP.
   With some surveys indicating as many as 25 percent of American
workers already bear some caregiving responsibility, employers are
increasingly helping workers double as caregivers without their job
performance suffering.
   ``We certainly recognize that caregiving is a demanding and
distracting job, especially caring for the elderly,'' said Sarah
Mullady, director of Champion International Corp.'s employee
assistance program.
   Champion is among a growing number of companies offering
``eldercare'' benefits such as unpaid leave, workshops and advice
on caring for dependent relatives, and educational materials on
aging issues and services.
   Employees are ``trying desperately to hold it all together'' as
they juggle work and family responsibilities, said Karen Leibold,
of Stride Rite Children's Centers. In addition to the ``mommy
track'' _ where working mothers are unable to take demanding job
promotions because of competing needs at home _ there is a
``daughter track'' that holds back women who care for aged
relatives.
   ``We as employers really have to begin taking a pro-active
stance in helping our employees meet all of these needs,'' Leibold
said. ``Anything we can do as employers to help in their efforts
can really create a win-win situation for everyone.''
   Stride Rite next year plans to expand the child care center at
its Cambridge, Mass., headquarters into an intergenerational
facility that will serve about 55 children and 24 frail adults.
Half the slots will be filled with relatives of company employees
and half from the community.
   ``We think and we hope that it's really going to address issues
like absenteeism and turnover,'' Leibold said.
   The support for eldercare benefits comes in response to mounting
evidence that the stress of caregiving can hurt job performance.
Executives surveyed by John Hancock Financial Services and Fortune
magazine, for example, said caregivers took more unscheduled days
off and left work early.
   Mullady recalls that her own job evaluations slipped a notch
when she was caring for her dying 92-year-old mother. ``I was not
at peak performance; there was no way I could have been.''
   The prolonged stress of caregiving also can adversely affect
mental and physical health, said Dr. Gene Cohen, deputy director of
the National Institute on Aging. Studies found significant symptoms
of depression in many caregivers, and some experienced changes in
their immune system that made them more vulnerable to a range of
physical illnesses.
   ``Society is beginning to appreciate the ramifications of the
remarkable demographic revolution,'' Cohen said. ``What society
hasn't fully appreciated is that those ramifications apply not only
to the older individual but to the family system as a whole.''
   Caregiving needs are expected to triple over the next four
decades, requiring further growth in the ``eldercare'' industry and
more cooperation between businesses and state and local agencies on
aging, said Harry Posman, acting associate commissioner of the U.S.
Administration on Aging.
   Glasse said employers' programs are only part of the answer; the
nation needs to ensure that all Americans receive the long-term
care they need, both in nursing homes and at home, without putting
all the burden on family members.
   Some advocates for the elderly have expressed concern that
Congress may shy away from addressing the problem after biting
criticism from senior citizens over the Medicare catastrophic care
program enacted last year.

<HEAD>No Regrets After 32 Years On The Federal Appeals Court</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By BILL CRIDER</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nothing short of catastrophe stops
84-year-old John Minor Wisdom, now in his 32nd year as a federal
appeals court judge.
   It hurts to watch him walk. A slight man, stooped and gray, he
creaks along, leaning heavily on a cane. Both knees are artificial;
arthritis ruined the ones he was born with. Surgeons rummaged
around inside his chest recently to repair a major artery in his
heart. His aorta was about to blow out like an old inner tube.
Surgery cost him six weeks in a hospital and a month at home.
   But being stuck in bed didn't mean not working for Wisdom, a
member of a special three-judge court handling still another racial
desegregation case.
   Court fights involving race have been a large part of his
working day since he was appointed to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals by Dwight Eisenhower in 1957. He nearly always came down on
the side of blacks fighting segregation.
   ``The more exposure you get to this problem the more you realize
that the blacks have had a raw deal for 300 years and that we owe a
debt to them.''
   Wisdom and one or more of three other judges with similar
outlooks _ Elbert Tuttle of Atlanta, John Brown of Houston and
Richard Rives of Montgomery, Ala. _got most of the racial cases,
and were dubbed ``The Four'' by their brethren.
   Four landmark decisions, written by Wisdom in 1965-67, whipped
the crawl of school desegregation to a gallop. Instead of the ``all
deliberate speed'' pace of the Supreme Court, the 5th Circuit
imposed immediate affirmative action.
   When he was appointed to the court, John Minor Wisdom seemed
more like a contented member of the upper crust than likely to
shake up the Deep South. ``I was much more moderate than I am now.
It was a gradual progression in my philosophy,'' he said.
   Wisdom's ancestors came in the 1840s from Virginia and Kentucky.
He was born in New Orleans in 1905, graduated from Washington and
Lee University, studied English at Harvard for a year, took law at
Tulane.
   Political activism was Wisdom's road to the bench. At the 1952
Republican National Convention in Chicago he led a fight to have
Eisenhower delegates from Louisiana seated instead of delegates
committed to Ohio Sen. Robert Taft. The victory was the turning
point in Eisenhower's bid for nomination.
   Buses full of tourists used to pause in front of the Wisdom
mansion while the tour guide exalted him as the man who made
Eisenhower president.
   In return, Eisenhower kept Wisdom from becoming a much richer
man. At the time of his appointment to the 5th Circuit, he was a
founding member of what is still one of the city's biggest, busiest
law firms.
   Decreeing racial integration for others did not change his own
social habits much. He remained a member of all-white, all-male
exclusive clubs. Such conflict with his legal views did not disturb
him.
   ``I can't change their minds,'' he said, ``and they can't change
mine.''
   ``I took a lot of kidding,'' he recalled recently. ``One fellow,
every time he saw me would say, `Hey, John, what have you done to
us white folks today?'''
   Amiable jibes weren't enough for some. Wisdom found rattlesnakes
on his lawn. Two of his dogs were poisoned. ``For years they tried
to keep me awake nights. I'd get telephone calls between one and
four o'clock in the morning. We couldn't take the phone off the
hook because we had two kids off at school and we felt they should
be able to get hold of us.''
   Hostilities stayed at the harassment level. Wisdom never
bothered to ask for police protection, ``and to my knowledge I was
never given protection,'' he said. ``My office door was open, just
like it is now.''
   Despite age and aches, Wisdom still works. In 1977, he stepped
back to senior status _ semi-retirement _ eliminating
administrative duties. But he hears as many cases as ever and often
sits on other circuits.
   ``I sit all over the place,'' he said. ``I go to San Francisco,
to New York, Washington, Chicago. But I am going to lessen up over
the coming year.''

   From time to time everyone forgets where he
or she leaves the car keys, or the car. But can you imagine
forgetting how to drive?
   Whether it's an aged aunt, grandparent, or our own parents, many
of us have had some experience with older people who experience
failing mental abilities. I am surprised how many people still
equate this loss with old age.
   Thirty years of research on aging tells us that when memory loss
interferes with daily living, it is not normal but the result of
some underlying disease. Identifying the disease isn't always easy
but it is extremely important for the person with this problem to
have a medical evaluation. For some, the illness can be treated and
the memory loss and confusion clear up. For others, the cause is a
progressive brain disease, such as Alzheimer's disease.
   Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease yet, that
doesn't mean there is no treatment. Good medical care from someone
who knows the range of problems Alzheimer's patients have can help
patients live as normal a life as possible and make the job of
caring for them much easier on their families.
   We estimate that 4 million people in this country may now have
Alzheimer's disease, about 10 percent of the population over age
65. Although uncommon in people in their 50s and 60s current
studies indicate that by their ninth decade at least one of every
four people will become afflicted. The economic burden is at least
$80 billion a year _ enough to bankrupt a small nation.
   Because many disorders mimic Alzheimer's, it is difficult to
diagnose. In fact, diagnosis can only be made with 100 percent
certainty by examining brain tissue after a patient dies.
Nonetheless, specialists at major medical centers now have an array
of tests offering reliable diagnosis more than 90 percent of the
time, compared with 60 percent to 80 percent accuracy just 10 years
ago.
   On the federal level, the National Institute on Aging funds 15
Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. And the U.S. Administration
on Aging and the Veterans Administration support long-term care
centers, important sources of research and training for those who
deal with dementia and other illnesses of aging.
   On the state level, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, New Jersey, New
York, California, Illinois, Maryland, Oklahoma and Virginia now
support specialized Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment
centers.
   No one knows for sure what causes Alzheimer's disease. We do
know from tissue examined under a microscope that certain brain
cells stop working and die. Among the experimental treatments being
explored are those looking at ways to stop or reverse brain cell
death. One especially exciting area involves use of substances
produced in the brain that help nerve cells thrive. This may hold
promise for treating neurological diseases and brain damage from
injury.
   Many important research advances have occurred in the past year.
For example, an abnormal protein that accumulates in the Alzheimer
brain has been found in the skin and other organs, one more clue
that this is not simply a disease of the brain, and a possible step
toward a simple test for it.
   Another area that is of practical value involves patient care.
While average survival ranges between six and 10 years, some
Alzheimer's patients live more than 20 years. As the disease
progresses, the need for continuous care puts great stress on
caregivers. Studies of patients and their caregivers are teaching
us how families cope and helping to prepare health professionals
and policymakers to meet their needs.
   In the meantime, organizations like the national, non-profit
Alzheimer's Association offer patients and families services
ranging from support groups to information on the disease and
referrals to community services. And every state and community in
the United States has a government agency on aging to assist older
people. Over half the states have task forces or commissions to
study the problem of Alzheimer's in their state. Many offer
Alzheimer's Disease Resource Centers, some with toll-free numbers.
States with large ethnic populations like California, the District
of Columbia, New York, Florida and Texas have educational programs
tailored to minority caregivers' needs.
   Public@private partnerships are also springing up to meet the
needs of caregivers. One example is the Administration on Aging,
which is working with the Alzheimer's Association and the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation to implement dementia day care and
short-term respite services. Workplace programs are being developed
by private groups like the American Association of Retired Persons
and the Washington Business Group on Health in recognition of the
growing impact of dementia on employed caregivers.

<HEAD>Consider Your Plants When Kid-Proofing for the Holidays</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Don't overlook the potential danger of common
ornamental plants when making precautionary checks before visits
from pre-schoolers.
   The worst that happens usually involves only some anxious
moments after little Susie or Johnnie is seen munching on a leaf or
swallowing a berry. But quite painful or life-threatening
experiences are possible.
   It's something like having a backyard swimming pool. The
proportion of children and adults getting into trouble is
infinitesimal compared to everyone's exposure, but the danger is
nonetheless real.
   Most of the big-leaf houseplants, like dieffenbachia and
philodendron, can cause trouble to the unwary. Berries of plants
such as privet, holly and castor beans can be toxic. So can bulbs
of daffodils, crocus and hyacinths; pods of birds of paradise;
seeds from sweet peas; acorns and all parts of oleanders. The list
is so general, in fact, that a basic rule is never to put anything
in your mouth unless you're sure it's safe.
   To adults this is so obvious that Dr. Donald B. Kunkel says,
``Plant poisoning questions are almost exclusively childhood
problems.''
   Kunkel is in his 10th year as medical director of the Poison
Control Center that covers Phoenix and two adjoining counties. It
offers emergency guidance on all types of poison questions, and a
breakdown of last year's nearly 40,000 calls shows about 5 percent
involved plants. Kunkel estimates 95 percent of those concerned
children under age 5.
   ``We get a substantial number of calls from grandparents, not
just about plants, of course, but all things. Kids are over to
grandma's and grandpa's house, and it's kind of a new environment
and they're poking through things. Grandparents, if they're not
careful, can become a pretty good source of poison.''
   Kunkel, a gardener, believes it's ridiculous to consider
discarding plants because of potential toxicity. But he recommends
keeping houseplants above the reach of toddlers. Outdoors, he
suggests instruction, just as children are taught to stay out of
the street or not play with fire.
   The center's 1988 calls about plants aren't broken down between
indoors and outdoors, ``but looking at the types of plants listed
I'd estimate 20 to 30 percent were indoor plants,'' Kunkel said.
   ``Most were inquiries about whether a plant is poisonous. I
don't have any figures on how many were actually hospitalized after
treatment but it would be rare, perhaps a couple dozen kids in 10
years. Once or twice a year, kids have their stomachs pumped out.
However, it's something you always worry about when you get such a
call. And there are quite a few plants if you eat enough of them
you'll have nausea, diarrhea, things like that.''
   In recent years, deaths have been recorded in Arizona from water
hemlock (Cicuta douglasii) and tree tobacco (Nicotiana glaula),
which grow mainly in remote areas. Four deaths from oleander were
reported nationally this decade, but, Kunkel said, all involved
adults who took it intentionally.
   ``The kid who occasionally nibbles on the leaf of an oleander
probably isn't in a great risk. But we certainly recommend that a
Poison Center be contacted and given a chance to evaluate the
situation.''
   A common name for dieffenbachia is dumbcane. When chewed, it
causes quick swelling of mucus membranes around the mouth and
tongue, causing difficulty in breathing. Death is possible. Fellow
members of the Araceae family, such as philodendrons and caladiums,
may have similar effects. African violets and begonias also cause
concern.
   Fortunately, most problem plants are quite bitter to taste,
discouraging the attempt. But even parts of common foodstuffs can
be dangerous, so know what you're eating. Avoid, for example, seeds
of apples, leaves of rhubarb or sun-exposed, greenish parts of the
potato tuber.
   It's wise to identify your plants in advance of any need. If
buying new plants, ask the nursery people what parts, if any, are
toxic. The nursery often can help in identifying plant samples,
experienced neighborhood gardeners are another possibility, and
most poison centers offer illustrative brochures.

<HEAD>Study Finds Aerobic Exercise Good for Older People, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy older people who did aerobic exercises
in a four-month study improved their physical well-being and their
outlook on life.
   The study of 101 healthy men and women age 60-83 found that
those who participated in an hour-long aerobic exercise program
three times a week showed improved cardiorespiratory fitness, lower
cholesterol, a small weight loss and an increase in bone mineral
content among subjects at risk of bone fractures.
   The moderate-intensity exercise program included a 10-minute
warmup, 30 minutes of bicycling, 15 of brisk walking-jogging and 5
of cool-down exercises.
   Other subjects in the study participated in a yoga and
flexibility exercise program or were part of a control group whose
members did not change their physical activity habits. These groups
showed no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness.
   While the study found no significant changes in a battery of
psychological tests, members of the aerobic and yoga groups felt
healthier and slept better and ``reported improved family
relations, better sex life, less loneliness and a better social
life ... improved mood, self-confidence and life satisfaction, and
that they had better memory and concentration,'' the researchers
reported.
   Members of the control group noticed little change over the four
months.
   The research, carried out by scientists from Duke University
Medical Center and the North Carolina Spine Center, was financed by
grants from the National Institute on Aging and the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute.
   Results of the study, led by Dr. James A. Blumenthal, were
reported in the September issue of The Journal of Gerontology:
Medical Sciences, published by The Gerontological Society of
America.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Often See Life as Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly people often consider their
life stories to be over by the time they enter a nursing home, says
a sociologist who asked nursing-home residents to divide their
lives into chapters.
   ``Rarely does the last chapter include their current
situation,'' said Jaber Gubrium, of the University of Florida. ``It
may end at retirement or when a spouse dies _ but it rarely ends
with the nursing home.''
   Although the elderly acknowledge their current existence in a
nursing home, they do not deem it part of their lives, Gubrium said.
   His study, funded by the National Institute on Aging, found that
the few people who have close relationships in a nursing home are
likeliest to consider the institution home-like and the experience
a meaningful part of their lives.
   ``When we ask nursing home patients if the place is home,
they'll say `No. It's homey, but it's not home.' One woman who did
call the place home said her roommate was like a sister to her and
several other people were like family to her,'' Gubrium said.
Others said nursing homes would be more like home if they were free
to come and go. Dependence and poor health _ not the nursing home
itself _ separated ``just living'' from life in these people.
   ``We chose people close to the end of life for this study
because we wanted to see if life extends subjectively to the very
end,'' he said.
   Gubrium began his two-year study this fall by interviewing
residents of nursing homes, adult congregate living facilities and
the general community in the Gainesville area. Unlike nursing home
residents, other people in the study include their current living
circumstances as part of their lives.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deutsche Bank AG, West Germany's largest bank,
said today that it offered to buy British merchant bank Morgan
Grenfell PLC in a friendly cash deal valued at $1.48 billion.
   The move was designed to block a hostile bid for Morgan Grenfell
by France's Banque Indosuez.
   Deutsche Bank's $8.56-a-share offer was $1.15 per share over
Morgan Grenfell's close Friday on the London Stock Exchange.
However, the announcement pushed Morgan Grenfell's stock slightly
above the offer price.
   The bid came three days before a vote by shareholders of Willis
Faber PLC, a British insurance services concern, on whether to sell
its remaining 9.9-percent stake in Morgan Grenfell to Banque
Indosuez for $7.19 a share.
   Earlier this month, Willis Faber sold Banque Indosuez a
10.5-percent stake in Morgan Grenfell for $6.38 dollars a share,
raising the French bank's stake in its British target to 14.9
percent.
   Banque Indosuez says it seeks a 24.8 percent stake, but needs
Bank of England approval to own more than 15 percent.
   In a joint statement today, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell
said the British bank ``will operate as a separate legal entity
within the Deutsche Bank group and with a high degree of autonomy.''
   Deutsche Bank has for years held a 4.9-percent stake in Morgan
Grenfell. Morgan Grenfell had initiated talks with the German bank
and a number of other European financial institutions over a
protective alliance after Indosuez announced its takeover
intentions.
   Indosuez, however, could raise its offer to Willis Faber, make a
general offer topping Deutsche Bank's, or simply sell its stake to
Deutsche Bank at a profit.

   Asia, which produces 95 percent of the
world's raw silk, has gained a foothold in the market for finished
silk products, a United Nations report has found.
   Asian countries traditionally export raw silk to Europe, where
it was made into cloth and garments. But the November report said
major producing countries including China, India and Thailand have
been exporting more finished products.
   Their success has been partly due to increasing demand for
natural fibers sparked by the ecological awareness movement in the
West, the report said.
   It said China, which accounts for 60 percent of world's raw
silk, plans to reduce the share of its raw silk exports to 30
percent in 1990 from 49 percent in 1980, and to increase exports of
finished products and fabrics to 70 percent in 1990, from 51
percent in 1980.

   The European Community said Monday that
it signed a draft trade and economic cooperation accord with the
Soviet Union, four months after talks began.
   The accord is the fourth accord between the EC and an East
European country since the Community and the Moscow-led Comecon
trade bloc signed a mutual recognition agreement on June 25, 1988.
   It reflects the rapid changes in Europe's political landscape.
   Since late 1988, the EC has signed agreements with Hungary,
Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Separately Monday, European Community External Relations
Commissioner Frans Andriessen called the developments in
Czechoslovakia of the last week ``a cause for profound rejoicing
throughout Europe.''
   ``Political reform and economic liberalization in Czechoslovakia
form part of a wider process which, for the first time in more than
40 years, offers to future generations the prospect of a Europe no
longer riven by division,'' he said in a statement.
   The trade and economic cooperation pact with Moscow must be
formally approved by the 12 EC states, which is considered a
formality, before it takes effect.
   No details of the draft agreement were immediately released.

Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded international crude oil,
was quoted at a spot price of $18.47 a barrel in quiet dealings
Monday, up slightly from $18.44 late Friday.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of crude, was
down slightly in early trading with the near-term contract at
$19.79 a barrel, down 3 cents from Friday's close.
   OPEC was at an impasse, and loosely split into two camps, over
how to meet demands from Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates for
bigger shares of the cartel's production pie, sources said Sunday.
   ``We have not yet reached the stage of proposals. The issues are
so sensitive apparently that no one dares putting foreward
proposals,'' Algerian oil minister Sadek Boussena said. ``We are
still at the starting point.
   The cartel's gathering formally began on Saturday, and the
ministers suspended talks on Sunday to reflect on their options.
   OPEC members in the past have found such breaks, as well as
holding small group discussions in their hotels, more productive
than gathering all the ministers at the cartel's Vienna
headquarters.
   The ministers must decide whether to change their production
ceiling of 20.5 million barrels a day and their target price of $18
a barrel.
   Oil prices have been firm, with OPEC's ``basket,'' or composite,
of crude oils at $17.76 a barrel lately, even though analysts say
OPEC members are exceeding the group's output ceiling by more than
2.5 million barrels a day.
   Prices are more than $5 a barrel higher than a year ago because
of strong demand for oil from Third World countries and a decline
in output from non-OPEC producers. But OPEC is expecting demand to
fall in the first six months of next year.
   The oil market traditionally softens in the first and second
quarters as winter heating demands slacken before summer cooling
and gasoline demands pick up.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been pumping about
double, or 2 million barrels a day each, what they are allowed
under the last OPEC agreement, underscoring their calls for bigger
shares.
   All the ministers appear to agree that the total ceiling could
be raised, perhaps by as much as 2 million barrels a day, but they
disagree on how the increase should be parceled out.
   A ministerial source, who demanded anonymity, on Sunday
described the two loose camps this way:
   One camp, led by the heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Iran, thinks
the increase in production should be granted to those members who
can produce more. Some members already are operating at near
capacity.
   This idea would allow Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates to
pump more, and would leave unchanged the shares for Saudi Arabia,
Iran and Iraq. The rest of the members would reduce their shares of
a larger pie.
   But this idea is onerous to poorer members that are more
dependent on their oil revenues, the ministerial source said.
   The second camp believes all the members should give up part of
their share to allow Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates larger
slices, the ministerial source said.
   But Saudi Arabia has insisted it won't accept less than its
allotment of one-quarter of the total production limit. It recently
increased its production above its quota, a move analysts say is
designed to emphasize that point.
   The fallback position would be to increase production equally
among all members, the ministerial source said.
   But this wouldn't address Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates'
demands for bigger shares, nor solve the problem of cheating on
quotas, which undermines OPEC's aims.
   Algeria's Boussena said an option being considered is an
agreement that would not be signed by all 13 OPEC members.
   Boussena added, ``We must have an agreement of 13. That is my
point of view.''
   OPEC could simply roll over its existing accord, as it has done
in the past, but the oil markets likely would view such a move as a
sign of weakness.
   Failure to reach an agreement could bring oil prices to as low
as $12 a barrel by the spring, the anonymous ministerial source
said.

   OPEC ministers resumed negotiations today
in an effort to reach an oil production and price agreement for the
first half of 1990.
   Seven oil ministers from the 13-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries gathered in a hotel room to see if they could
overcome their differences.

producers' regular winter conference, now in its third day. North

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
dropped for the second straight week, declining by three this week
to 1,037 after rising 10 times in the past 13 weeks.
   But the total still reflects 126 more working rigs than for the
same week a year ago, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday. Last week,
the count dropped by five to 1,040.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Louisiana posted the largest
gains with 10 new rigs, while Colorado had three more. Declines
included a drop of five in New Mexico and drops of three rigs each
in Oklahoma and California. The number of rigs in Texas remained
unchanged. There were no reports for other producing states.

   The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press published
their first editions under a partial merger today after a
three-year legal battle, but a possible strike may stall the joint
operation before it's a week old.
   Talks between the newspapers and the unions broke off Sunday
over wage and benefit demands.
   William Keating, chief executive of the Detroit Newspaper
Agency, which runs the combined operations, said he doesn't expect
a strike. ``I have consistently felt that labor matters can be
resolved and I continue to feel that way,'' he said Sunday.
   Detroit's two major daily newspapers began publishing under a
joint operating agreement following a vote Nov. 13 by the U.S.
Supreme Court, which upheld lower court rulings approving the
100-year agreement.
   The Knight-Ridder Inc.-owned Free Press declared it was a
financially failing newspaper in April 1986 and applied with the
News for permission to enter the operating agreement. Federal law
grants newspapers exemption from antitrust law if it's determined a
merger would prevent the failure of a paper and thus preserve two
independent editorial voices.
   According to figures released Nov. 13, the daily circulation of
the News, the nation's ninth largest newspaper, is 690,422, and
832,383 Sundays. The Free Press, the 10th biggest paper, had
circulations of 626,434 and 687,537.
   The newspapers merged business operations under the Detroit
Newspaper Agency. News and editorial departments remain separate
and independent but combined editions will be published on the
weekend under the masthead The Detroit News and Free Press. About
500 jobs were to be cut as a result of the arrangement.
   While the newspapers prepared the first post-agreement edition
of the Free Press for today, workers voted against ratifying a
contract offer from the new newspaper agency and in favor of strike
authorization.
   Teamsters Local 372, which represents 1,100 drivers and other
circulation workers, set a strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
Newspaper Guild Local 22, representing about 500 editorial workers
from both papers, voted unanimously to support a strike.
   ``The members of both papers feel the money package and benefits
were an insult to them,'' said Louis Mleczko, a News reporter and
president of Local 22. ``The publishers are going to have to share
some of the new riches from the 100-year monopoly they have been
granted from the court.''
   Robert H. Giles, president and publisher of Gannett Co. Inc.'s
Detroit News, said he expected issues to be resolved before the
strike deadline.
   Don Kummer, administrative officer for Local 22, said: ``What
we're looking at is the company testing the union to see if they'll
strike.''
   Press operators in the Graphics Communications International
Local 13-N surprised other unions by ratifying the wage offer from
the publishers. But they pledged to honor picket lines if the other
unions walked out.
   In other ratification votes announced Sunday, the unions
representing Detroit News photoengravers, workers who handle
special inserts and sort papers, and composing room employees also
rejected the new company's contract offers.
   Mleczko said the publishers offered a $30-per-week raise during
the first year of a 2{-year contract, $30 the second year and $15
for the remaining six months, and a signing bonus equal to two
weeks' pay.
   The unions wanted a $40-per-week raise the first year, $30 the
second and $40 for the next six months, plus a three-week bonus.
   The unions also asked the newspaper to pay for increases in
health care costs for future retirees. Fifty percent of those costs
currently are paid by unions.
   Union members at the two newspapers have had one raise in their
contracts since the operating agreement was announced in 1986. The
average wage for editorial employees and production workers at the
newspapers is $562 a week.
   Teamsters officials said the strike was set for Thursday to give
the employees time to get established under the new operations.
   The last newspaper strike in Detroit was at the Free Press in
July 1980 when Teamsters stayed away 12 days over economic issues.

<HEAD>Soybean Decline Drags Corn Down; Wheat Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, dragging the corn market
lower. But wheat futures gained slightly on indications of renewed
Soviet buying interest.
   Selling of soybean futures stemmed from a continued lack of
export demand, analysts said.
   An abundance of Malaysian palm oil on the world market is
forcing soybean oil prices lower and European soybean processers
are believed to have enough beans on hand to last them through
December, said William Biedermann, director of research with the
futures brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   He said the opening dip in soybean futures triggered some
technical sell signals, accelerating the market's decline. The
January contract's drop below $5.83 a bushel was especially
significant.
   ``A close below that level would turn funds into sellers and
cause speculators to bail out,'' Biedermann said.
   Wheat futures were mixed and gaining, boosted by fading
prospects for substantial rainfall today in the winter wheat belt
and by Soviet purchases of wheat in Europe, an indication the
Soviet Union has re-entered the world grain market after an absence
of about three weeks.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to 1\ cent
higher with December at $4.08 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\
cents lower with December at $2.36} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
1\ cents lower with December at $1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 4{

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .07 cent higher with December
at 76.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .18 cent
higher with November at 83.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .03 cent higher with December at 51.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .18 cent to .50 cent higher with February

   Two former Tennessee financiers already
serving prison terms pleaded guilty today prior to the start of
their federal trial on charges of bilking an Orlando bank of $3.9
million.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ricardo Pesquera said Jake Butcher, Earl
Wilson, and Wilson's wife, Harriette, pleaded guilty to some of
charges in the case. He did not elaborate.
   Butcher and Wilson, who are serving federal prison sentences for
bank fraud in Tennessee and Kentucky, had pleaded innocent in
September to 51 counts of bank fraud, bribery, conspiracy and
misapplication of funds.
   Along with Mrs. Wilson and nine others, they were charged in the
1986 collapse of Florida Center Bank in Orlando. A federal grand
jury charged that Butcher and the Wilsons paid former bank
president Joe F. Justice to funnel money secretly from the bank to
Butcher and Wilson.
   At the time, Butcher had filed for bankruptcy in Tennessee and
was under investigation for bank fraud. Butcher and Wilson once
operated a 20-bank chain.
   Butcher is serving a 20-year prison sentence for bank fraud in
Tennessee and Kentucky. Wilson is serving a 10-year sentence for
bank fraud in Tennessee. The others, including Mrs. Wilson, are
free on bail.

<HEAD>Deutsche Bank Makes Friendly Bid for Morgan Grenfell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deutsche Bank, West Germany's largest bank, on
Monday emerged as a ``white knight'' for Morgan Grenfell Group PLC
with a $1.48 billion takeover offer designed to stave off a hostile
bid by Banque Indoquez of France.
   Analysts said the $8.56-a-share cash offer, which has the full
backing of Morgan Grenfell's board of directors, represented a
premium over what the investment bank's stock was recently trading.
   Morgan Grenfell closed at $7.40 a share Friday on the London
Stock Exchange; it had fallen as low as $4 a share earlier this
year. The stock, though, rose sharply in price on Monday.
   ``It's a knock-out bid, one designed to forestall any notion
that Indosuez could top it,'' says Robert Law, a bank analyst at
Shearson Lehman Securities Ltd.
   Paris-based Indosuez, which already owns 14.9 percent of Morgan
Grenfell, had no comment on Deutsche Bank's bid, a spokesman said.
But analysts said it was unlikely Indosuez will make a higher offer.
   Last month, British insurer Willis Faber PLC sold a 10.6 percent
stake in Morgan Grenfell to Indosuez for $6.38 a share.
   Banque Indosuez says it seeks a 24.8 percent stake but needs
Bank of England approval to own more than 15 percent.
   Willis Faber shareholders were to meet Wednesday to decide
whether to accept Indosuez's $7.19-a-share offer for their
remaining 9.8 percent stake in Morgan Grenfell. But Willis Faber
appeared unlikely to sell unless Indosuez offered a higher price,
and said it was considering suspending the meeting.
   In a joint statement, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell said the
British bank ``will operate as a separate legal entity within the
Deutsche Bank group and with a high degree of autonomy.''
   Independent for 151 years, Morgan Grenfell was known as the
takeover king during the mid-1980s, playing a role in some of
Britain's biggest mergers. But it failed in its ambition of
becoming a fully integrated securities house, and pulled out of
share-dealing a year ago, firing 450 employees.
   John Craven, Morgan Grenfell's chairman, and Alfred Herrhausen,
a member of Deutsche Bank's board of managing directors, stressed
the mutual benefits of the deal.
   Deutsche Bank will get Morgan Grenfell's strength in corporate
finance and fund management, while strengthening its position in
the British market. Morgan will benefit from the West German bank's
distribution network and client base.
   ``The acquisition of Morgan Grenfell is an important step for
Deutsche Bank, which recognizes the pre-eminence of the London
market place within Europe in the fields of corporate finance and
asset management,'' Herrhausen said.
   ``We see the combination of the two organizations as an
excellent fit. Together we will form an unrivaled and powerful team
and give the enlarged Deutsche Bank group a leading position in
Europe.''

   Share prices on London's stock exchange were
slightly higher Monday.
   The Financial Times 100-share index was up 1.9 points, or 0.09
percent, at 2,224.3, up from an early afternoon low of 2,212.9. A
light 333.3 million shares changed hands in quiet trading.
   Stock prices fell early on jitters over the slumping pound,
which continued to fall Monday, especially against the West German
mark. By the end of the London session, the pound was quoted at
2.79 marks, off sharply from 2.82 marks late Friday.
   An early rise on Wall Street, where participation returned in
full force after the Thanksgiving holiday, boosted late-afternoon
trading.
   The market received some support from West Germany's Deutsche
Bank AG's $1.48 billion cash bid for merchant bank Morgan Grenfell
PLC, a move which is seen as thwarting an unfriendly bid by
France's Banque Indosuez.
   Reflecting the market's belief that Deutsche Bank will be
victorious in its efforts, Morgan Grenfell shares finished below
the offer price of 550 pence, or $8.56, a share but up 60 pence, or
94 cents, from Friday.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said
Monday that it erred when it said 234,000 dolls manufactured by the
Omaha-based Oriental Trading Co. were being recalled because they
posed a choking hazard to small children.
   CPSC spokesman Ken Giles said the recall affected only 7,800
dolls, which were sold through mail order catalogues as the ``Dress
Up Clown'' or ``Funny Clown.''
   The incorrect figure was reported by The Associated Press on
Friday.
   Giles said about 250,000 similar dolls imported by other
companies were being investigated but that no recalls for them have
been announced.

<HEAD>EDS: SUBS final graf to CORRECT that GPA didn't disclose potential
loss from jets; No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. bankruptcy judge has decided that
Braniff Inc.'s agreements to lease and buy new jets are valid,
enabling the troubled airline to keep its most valuable asset.
   But the judge also ruled Saturday that Braniff must pay $3
million to GPA Group Ltd., an aircraft leasing company, by midnight
Monday to keep five Airbus A-320s the airline has ordered, and must
pay for future planes within 60 days after delivery.
   By continuing to take delivery of 50 Airbus A-320s, Braniff will
have a better chance to reorganize and operate under Chapter 11 of
the Federal Bankruptcy Act, the airline's lawyers said. Otherwise,
the Orlando-based carrier might be forced to cease operating
entirely and sell its remaining asets.
   A trial ended Saturday in Braniff's lawsuit against GPA Group
that claimed the Irish company improperly canceled a lease
agreement for 26 of the Airbuses. As a major creditor of Braniff,
GPA is trying to retain the aircraft and protect itself from
potential losses.
   While celebrating Judge C. Timothy Corcoran's decision that the
lease agreement remains in effect, Braniff's lawyers acknowledged
that the airline will pay dearly for its right to keep its lease
and purchase contracts.
   Howard Glassman, a Philadelphia lawyer representing Braniff,
said he did not know if the airline has enough money to meet
Monday's deadline. If Braniff fails to pay, GPA, which is leasing
the five Airbus jets, may sue the carrier in court to take
possession of the jets.
   Since filing for protection from its creditors Sept. 28, Braniff
has stopped flying and laid off most of its workers, who once
totaled more than 4,800. The airline, which now employs about 275
people, is struggling to operate as a charter carrier.
   Airline analysts and experts view Braniff's ability to continue
receiving the 50 Airbus jets as the company's most valuable asset
and best chance for a successful reorganization. American Airlines
has acknowledged that it has discussed with Braniff the possibility
of acquiring those planes.
   Braniff has been stymied, however, in its efforts to sublease
the jets or sell its contracts for them.
   Just hours before the bankrupty filing, GPA canceled its
agreement to lease 26 Airbus jets to the airline. Braniff sued GPA
and several other companies involved in the leases for breach of
contract, violation of U.S. bankruptcy laws and other alleged
business misconduct.
   Because the validity of Braniff's lease and purchase contracts
was disputed, the airline was thwarted in its efforts to reorganize
under Chapter 11, Corcoran ruled.
   Lawyers representing GPA said the leasing company did not know
whether it would appeal Corcoran's decision. GPA, which is
privately held, declined to disclose how much it could lose if
Braniff cannot meet its financial obligations for the jets or find
a substitute buyer.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge in Technical Selloff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed lower Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, led by a steep soybean selloff linked
to slack export demand and bearish technical signals.
   Soybean prices opened lower in reaction to weak demand for U.S.
soybeans by European processors, partially reflecting the abundance
of Malaysian palm oil, a soybean-oil competitor.
   The opening losses triggered technical sell signals, especially
when the January soybean contract fell below the 55-day moving
average of $5.83 a bushel, said William Biedermann, director of
research with the futures brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake,
Ill.
   ``The technicals just really kicked in and we had fund and
speculator selling all day long _ heavy liquidation,'' he said.
   The wheat market closed narrowly mixed, with support stemming
from Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yuetter's statement that
France's sale of 1.3 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet
Union was ``an encouraging sign'' that the Soviets were back in the
market for wheat.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to { cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.06} a bushel; corn
futures were 3{ cents to 4} cents lower with December at $2.33\ a

   OPEC ministers said Monday they were
closer to reaching an oil production agreement for the first half
of 1990.
   Sources said the proposal would raise OPEC's production by 1.5
million barrels to 22 million barrels a day and allow the United
Arab Emirates to continue producing as it pleases.
   Venezuela and Indonesia would give up part of their share to
meet Kuwait's demands for a bigger portion, while other countries'
percentages would remain the same, the sources said.
   Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said during a break
from talks at OPEC's regular winter conference that the ministers
were discussing a new idea, but he declined to elaborate.
   ``I think the atmosphere is good,'' Aqazadeh said.
   Indonesian oil minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said: ``Ideas are
getting closer.''
   Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, Hisham Nazer said, ``We
will be continuing to meet.''
   The oil markets decided to reserve judgment, analysts said.
   The spot price for North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, was $18.44 a barrel Monday afternoon,
unchanged from late Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, was down sharply in late afternoon trading
with the near-term contract at $19.63 a barrel, down 19 cents from
Friday. But analysts said the weakness was not necessarily
OPEC-related.
   ``Traders on the whole have become more circumspect about an
early analysis of OPEC trends, having been caught too many times by
the whipsaw of seemingly contradictory statements by oil
ministers,'' said Peter Gignoux who heads Shearson Lehman Hutton's
international energy desk in London.
   Most of the 13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries met in a hotel room for several hours on Monday
to see if they could resolve their differences. They also met in
smaller groups during the day.
   The ministers gathered on Saturday for the opening of the
conference and then met informally on Sunday, part of their normal
strategy for establishing common ground.
   OPEC has been grappling with demands from Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates for larger shares of the group's total output.
   Most of the ministers seem to agree that OPEC's current ceiling
of 20.5 million barrels a day could be raised, since it would more
realistically reflect the group's actual output. However, there are
disputes about how large an increase there should be and how the
extra output should be divided.
   Analysts estimate that OPEC actually is producing more than 23
million barrels a day. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates each are
pumping double their quotas of 1.1 million barrels a day to press
their demands for a higher share of the total.
   The United Arab Emirates would be excluded from the deal now
under consideration and would continue to produce what it wants,
sources said.
   Prices have held at levels about 50 percent higher than a year
ago, despite the increased supply, thanks to strong world demand
and lower production by non-OPEC oil producers.
   Strong demand coupled with the fact that some members are
producing at near capacity anyway, has eased the pressure for OPEC
to solve its differences on quota allocations.
   If the ministers fail to take advantage of this absence of
crisis to work out their problems, their choices are: striking a
deal that isn't unanimous; giving all members an equal increase; or
simply rolling over their current agreement.
   But these choices would only postpone a solution to cheating by
OPEC members and the oil markets likely would view any one of them
as a sign of weakness.
   Such a market reaction, combined with the traditional slump in
oil demand during the spring, could deeply depress prices.

   Costlier gold and labor drove up the cost of
the gifts called for on the 12 days of Christmas this year, but
who's counting when it's your true love?
   Those who can't afford $2,316 for the 10 lords-a-leaping, $15
for a partridge (the pear tree is $24.95 extra) or $1,000 each for
a swimming swan probably should stick to ``White Christmas.''
Dreaming of something is cheaper.
   The cost of the 12 days as outlined in the popular carol rose
almost $800 this year to $14,598.78, J. Patrick Bradley, chief
economist of Provident National Bank, said Monday.
   The 5.9 percent increase in the bank's seventh annual Christmas
Price Index compared with a 4.8 percent increase in another CPI,
the Consumer Price Index, the government's inflation gague.
   Since the gifts accumulate with each refrain into a shopping
nightmare of 364 items, Bradley said a lovestruck swain would have
to spend $70,961.21 to buy the full carol.
   The bank turned to the Philadelphia Zoo for the costs of the
fowl, the Philadelphia Dance Co. for the cost of the dancers per
performance and the musicians union local chapter for the cost of a
single show.
   Bradley said seven of the 12 items remained stable at 1988
prices _ the partridge and pear tree, turtle doves, French hens,
calling birds, geese-a-laying, swans-a-swimming and maids-a-milking.
   But St. Nicholas forgot to tell the gold market Christmas was
coming. The cost of five gold rings this year, according to a local
jewelry store, rose 20 percent over last year's $625.
   As in other service industries, prices for the leaping lords and
ladies dancing waltzed up 16 percent to $2,316 and $2,084.40,
respectively.
   ``This increase in Christmas service industry prices mirrors
what's actually happening in parts of the economy in the service
sector. As a result, we are seeing an influx of people into service
industry jobs,'' Bradley said.
   Here are the prices for each of the daily gifts:
   _One partridge in a pear tree, $39.95, unchanged from last year.
   _Two turtle doves, $50, unchanged.
   _Three French hens, $15, unchanged.
   _Four calling birds, $280, unchanged.
   _Five gold rings, $750, up from $625.
   _Six geese-a-laying, $150, unchanged.
   _Seven swans-a-swimming, $7,000, unchanged.
   _Eight maids-a-milking, $26.80, unchanged.
   _Nine ladies dancing, $2,084.40, up from $1,800.
   _10 lords-a-leaping, $2,316, up from $2,000.
   _11 pipers piping, $905.58, up from $863.46.
   _12 drummers drumming, $981.05, up from $935.42.

   The publisher of Premiere Magazine, Peter W.
Eldredge, was named Monday to head a sales unit responsible for
getting large advertisers to buy space in multiple titles within
News Corp. Ltd.'s Murdoch Magazines group.
   In the newly created post of vice president-group sales,
Eldredge will also help combine multi-media packages for
advertisers matching the magazines with News Corp.'s other
divisions, which include Fox Inc.'s television network.
   Replacing Eldredge as publisher of Premiere will be Marian L.
Schwindeman, currently the magazine's associate publisher.
   Murdoch Magazines President John B. Evans said in announcing the
appointments that the magazine group has gone through a period of
very rapid growth, including last year's purchase of TV Guide and
Seventeen magazines.
   Total average circulation for the group is more than 25 million
per issue. Other magazines in the group include Automobile,
Mirabella, New Woman, New York Magazine, Soap Opera Digest, Soap
Opera Weekly and Star.
   Eldredge, 45, was publisher of Star for two years before being
appointed publisher of Premiere in June 1987. He joined Murdoch
Magazines in 1984 after eight years at Money Magazine, a Time
Warner Inc. publication.
   Ms. Schwindeman, 37, joined Premiere in November 1986 after
working for six years at The Village Voice, a weekly newspaper in
New York.

   Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks
by the nation's biggest automakers fell 4.4 percent in mid-November
from a year earlier, as declines by the Big Three continued pacing
an industrywide slump, according to figures the companies released
Monday.
   The automakers reported selling vehicles at an average daily
rate of 31,032 during the Nov. 11-20 period, compared with 32,436
during the year-earlier period.
   Car sales were down 6.1 percent and light truck sales were off
1.8 percent.
   Car sales fell for the Big Three _ General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. _ while mid-November car sales for the
other automakers were up.
   Overall, Big Three vehicle sales fell 8.6 percent from last year
during the period. Car sales fell 12.4 percent and light truck
sales were off 2.9 percent.
   The sales downturn began in early October, just as the 1990
model year got under way.
   Analysts predicted car purchasing in the fourth quarter would be
substantially lower than in the third quarter because consumers
rushed to showrooms in August and September to beat price increases
on 1990 model cars and trucks. The vehicles hit dealerships en
masse in early October.
   The continued slump may prompt the companies to further enhance
their buyer incentives, such as rebates or low-interest loan. Last
week, GM expanded its Oldsmobile dealer incentive program and
boosted the incentive program on its Chevrolet cars and trucks.
Chrysler last week also sweetened the incentive package on its
Eagle Premier cars.
   Through Nov. 20 this year, vehicle sales by the eight companies
were 2.6 percent behind the pace of the same period last year. Car
sales were down 3.6 percent and truck sales were 0.8 percent lower.
   Ford said sales of its cars and trucks were down 13 percent in
mid-November, with car sales down 11.6 percent and truck sales off
14.8 percent. For the year through Nov. 20, Ford's vehicle sales
were down 2.5 percent.
   Chrysler's car and truck sales pace in mid-November was down 3.3
percent from the year-earlier period. A 12 percent drop in Chrysler
car sales was offset by a 6 percent increase in light truck sales.
   Chrysler's year-to-date car and truck sales were 6.4 percent
behind last year's pace.
   GM said its mid-November car sales were down 13 percent while
its truck sales were up 4.1 percent, combining for a 7.3 percent
decline for all its vehicles during the period. For the year
through Nov. 20, GM's car and truck sales were down 5 percent from
last year.

<TEXT>
   Fiat said Monday it will sign an agreement
to build a new line of cars in the Soviet Union, an important step
in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to increase the supply of
consumer goods.
   The Turin-based automobile giant said the joint venture
agreement would be signed Tuesday, the eve of Gorbachev's visit to
Italy.
   Fiat is Italy's largest private industrial group and has
produced cars in the Soviet Union since 1970.
   Fiat's managing director, Cesare Romiti, and Nikolai Pyjin, the
Soviet minister for the automobile industry, were scheduled to sign
a letter of intent for the project in Rome on Tuesday.
   While financial details have not been released, analysts believe
that Fiat and the Soviet Union will invest up to $1.4 billion.
   The plant will be built at Elabung, 60 miles southeast of
Moscow, and is expected to turn out 300,000 automobiles a year when
it begins operations between 1992 and 1993, according to industry
sources.
   The output of the model, based on the popular Fiat Panda in
Italy, would be then increased to between 600,000 to 900,000 cars a
year.
   Out of the first year's production, about a fourth would be sold
on Western European markets, giving the Soviet side some return on
its investment, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Other ageements between Italian and Soviet companies are
expected to be signed during Gorbachev's three-day visit to Italy
and the Vatican.
   Among the initiatives reported in the works are an agreement
with Pirelli to produce 10 million tires a year in the Soviet
Union; a plant for household electronic goods by the Merloni group;
and a chemical and agro-industrial cooperation accord with the
Montedison-Ferruzzi group.
   Italian officials said Italy will also offer its technology to
help convert Soviet military industries into civilian ones.
   In 1966, Fiat became one of the first Western groups to launch a
major venture in the Soviet Union. The Togliattigrad auto plant,
which began production of Fiat 124 models in 1970, has contributed
about half of all Soviet vehicles.

<HEAD>Eastern to Negotiate with Pilots Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for Eastern Airlines and the pilots
union, which last week called off its strike, agreed Monday to meet
for federally mediated talks.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said there was a preliminary
meeting in Miami Monday, with a negotiating session planned Tuesday
under the auspices of Sam Cognata of the National Mediation Board.
   Pilots union spokesman Skip Orr called the session part of
contract negotiations that have gone on sporadically since the
pilots' contract became open to amendment more than a year ago. The
pilots' walkout was officially a sympathy strike for the Eastern
Machinists union, which went on strike after 1{ years of federally
mediated talks stalemated.
   Eastern and the pilots have a major new difference to negotiate:
how the 2,200 pilots who just ended their strike will get their
jobs back, or whether they will get them back.
   A letter from Skip Copeland, the head of Eastern's former
striking pilots, to Eastern President Phil Bakes last week said
that while a return to work was ``unconditional,'' ``it is our
position that all strikers should be reinstated promptly.''
   The letter said former striking pilots should receive seniority
and assignments in accordance with their contract.
   In a separate development Monday, Atlanta's aviation
commissioner ordered striking Eastern Machinists to vacate their
``tent city'' headquarters at Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport because of a rock-throwing incident in which a working
Eastern employee was injured.
   Miami-based Eastern, which began rebuilding without its unions,
said it has enough pilots _ 1,850 _ to operate its current
schedule. Of those, about 1,000 were hired as replacements during
the strike, and Eastern contends their jobs are protected against
returning strikers.
   The two sides had been far apart on salary issues and work rule
changes, although no current details were available Monday.
   Matell said the concessions Eastern wants from the pilots were
considered essential for the airline's effort to emerge from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   Orr said the negotiations on returning union pilots to work will
demonstrate the company's attitudes toward its workers.
   ``I think it would probably prevent possible litigation. It
would indicate to everyone concerned that they really do want to
rebuild Eastern with the most experienced people available,'' Orr
said.
   ``And it would indicate by actions rather than just words that
they do want to work with labor groups. We've never seen any
indications of that,'' he said.
   Eastern on Friday amended an August request that U.S. District
Court in Miami clarify the rights of employees who are currently
working and determine the rights of those who wish to return to
work.
   Matell said no hearing date had been set.
   He said there are also tentative plans for negotiations this
week between the company and the Transport Workers Union, which
represents flight attendants at Eastern.
   The flight attendants followed the pilots last week in ending
their sympathy strike, leaving only the Machinists union on the
picket lines.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, covering the airline industry and
other transportation labor, contracts remain in force until federal
mediation has been tried and fails, after which the union may
strike and the company may impose its conditions.
   Eastern last June sought in bankruptcy court to have the pilots'
contract invalidated, but then withdrew that request.
   After direct talks broke down, the pilots in June requested
federal mediation. There also were negotiations with the
court-appointed bankruptcy examiner, attorney David I. Shapiro.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days
after the strike began March 4.

   World sugar production is estimated at a

last year's estimated output, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   But the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said marginal
increases in production and strong growth in world consumption
``are expected to result in continuing high world prices.''
   Global sugar consumption in the 1989-90 sugar marketing year

increase of more than 1 million tons from the 1988-89 estimate, the

   Energy futures prices fell in light trading
Monday on what analysts described as a technical selloff.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
fell 19 cents to close at $19.63 a barrel.
   Contracts between February and June finished between 18 cents
and 25 cents lower.
   Analysts said the market's weakness did not reflect events in
Vienna, Austria, where the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is holding its semi-annual conference.
   OPEC ministers completed their third day of negotiations Monday
without reaching any conclusions on production limits, the issue
dominating the talks.
   ``We haven't heard any specific OPEC-related news and the
market's selloff didn't seem to be coordinated with news of the
adjournment,'' said Larry Lawrence, manager of options and
technical analysis for Elders Futures Inc.
   Refined oil products traded on the exchange also declined.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery lost 0.74 cent
to 50.89 cents a barrel, while contracts for delivery between
January and June ended 0.81 cent to 1.10 cents a gallon lower.
   No. 2 heating oil for December delivery slipped 0.49 cent to
60.92 cents a gallon, January lost 0.44 cent to 60.43 cents and
February declined 0.43 cent to 58.75 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said the sparse volume was due partly to the OPEC
meeting.
   ``People are waiting to hear,'' said Greg Dreis, energy broker
with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``Once we see a decision out of
OPEC we'll see more activity.''
   OPEC ministers are trying to decide whether to devise a new plan
for allotting production shares according to each nation's ability
to pump oil or simply to continue the current quota system.

<HEAD>Sales Down 4.4 Percent From Weak Period Last Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sales of new North American-made cars and trucks
fell 4.4 percent in mid-November from the same period last year,
automakers reported Monday in the latest indication of their
industry's weakness.
   The industry's lengthening sales slump _ which has been paced by
the Big Three of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. _ could mean automakers will lengthen their year-end factory
shutdowns in an attempt to trim production and deflate an inventory
backlog, analysts said.
   The eight major companies making cars and light trucks in North
America said they sold an average of 31,032 vehicles daily during
the Nov. 11-20 period, compared with a daily rate of 32,466 during
year-earlier period.
   Car sales dropped 6.1 percent while light truck sales fell 1.8
percent during the period.
   For the Big Three, overall vehicle sales were down 8.6 percent
from last year during the 10-day period.
   Through Nov. 20 of this year, car and truck sales from all
U.S.-based manufacturers were 2.6 percent behind last year's pace.
Car sales were down 3.6 percent and truck sales were off 0.8
percent during the year-to-date period
   The industry's sales slide began in early October, as automakers
ushered in the 1990 model year with higher prices.
   Analysts said Monday they expected automakers to consider
cutting production rather than piling on more rebates or other
customer incentives to help sell cars and trucks.
   ``We're at a point in the cycle where production cuts make more
sense,'' said John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York. He
said automakers might look at extending holiday shutdowns to reduce
production.
   ``It would dramatize to the feds the need for lower interest
rates and to the UAW how important it is to be sane in their
demands,'' Kirnan said.
   The United Auto Workers union and the Big Three automakers open
contract talks this summer over replacing the pacts that expire at
midnight Sept. 14, 1990.
   The automakers have been wrestling with bloated inventories
since early this year, trying to shrink them with dealer and
customer incentives and short-term plant shutdowns.
   Last week, the UAW staged a large demonstration at Chrysler
headquarters to protest the company's scheduled February closing of
a Detroit assembly plant and the laying off of 1,700 employees.
   Ford said its car and truck sales pace was down 13 percent in
mid-November, with car sales off 11.6 percent and truck sales off
14.8 percent. For the year through Nov. 20, Ford's vehicle sales
were down 2.5 percent.
   Chrysler's car and truck sales pace was down 3.3 percent in
mid-November from the same time last year. A 12 percent drop in its
car sales was offset by a 6 percent increase in its light truck
sales.
   Chrysler's year-to-date car and truck sales were down 6.4
percent from last year.
   General Motors said its mid-November car sales were down 13
percent while its truck sales were up 4.1 percent, combining for a
7.3 percent decline for its vehicles during the period. For the
year, GM's car and truck sales were down 5 percent from last year.

<HEAD>Critics Say IBM's Radiation Reduction Is Halfway Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move by International Business Machines Corp.
to reduce the electromagnetic radiation emitted by computer
displays does not go far enough, some critics said Monday.
   IBM was praised for taking the lead in reducing very low
frequency radiation, but several advocates of radiation reduction
said the company had neglected to do anything about the extremely
low frequency spectrum.
   ``This move of IBM's is partial at best, and I think is a public
relations stunt at worst,'' said Paul Brodeur, author of a newly
published book on electromagnetic radiation, ``Currents of Death.''
   Brodeur said the government and private industry should work
strenuously to cut electromagnetic radiation at 60 cycles a second,
the range associated with power lines. He argues it can cause
leukemia and brain cancer.
   IBM said Monday it did not do anything about the 60 hertz
radiation because customers had not asked for it. The company
argues there is no evidence that radiation from computer displays
is a health hazard. Scientific studies have been contradictory.
   ``We don't have any active work right now'' on 60 hertz
radiation, Paul Snayd, manager of IBM's VDT and Ergonomics Project
Office, said in an interview. ``We have not visited it at all.''
   IBM in September introduced a line of InfoWindow terminals for
mid-sized and mainframe computers that give off less
electromagnetic radiation in the 15 kilohertz to 17 kilohertz
range, categorized as very low frequency.
   The reduced-radiation feature of the terminals was included in
response to requests from customers in Sweden and Denmark, not
because of health concerns, IBM said. The terminals were promoted
as low-radiation in Europe but not in the United States, where
press materials made no mention of the radiation issue.
   Snayd said the radiation-reduction feature probably will be
introduced in future displays for personal computers. Some analysts
expect that to happen next year.
   No other U.S. computer makers have said they plan to follow
IBM's lead in radiation reduction.
   Brodeur faulted IBM for implying the terminals were low in
radiation when in fact they deal with only one portion of the
spectrum. But IBM's Snayd countered that the company had not billed
them as low radiation in the United States at all.
   ``When and if we do we'll be very precise about their
characteristics,'' he said.
   The Newspaper Guild union has been leading the fight for
controls on radiation from video display terminals. David Eisen,
the research and information director, praised IBM's radiation
reduction.
   ``This is certainly a salutary development, and certainly
something the unions in the United States and Canada have been
calling for for the last four years,'' Eisen said.
   But he added, ``It would be far better if they were shielding in
the (60 hertz) frequencies as well and I see no reason they should
not be shielding for both.''
   Electromagnetic radiation from computer displays is different
from and less dangerous than the ionizing radiation of gamma rays
and X-rays.

   BellSouth Corp. announced Monday its board of
directors had adopted a shareholder rights plan to protect the
company against the possibility of a hostile takeover.
   Company officials said the protection plan was not in response
to any attempt at an acquisition of BellSouth. The plan would take
effect if anyone acquired 10 percent of the company's stock without
management's approval.
   The move comes as BellSouth continues a bitter fight with McCaw
Cellular Communications Co. for control of the cellular telephone
properties of Lin Broadcasting Corp.
   ``This plan will help ensure that all BellSouth shareholders
realize the long-term value of their investment in the company by
requiring potential buyers to negotiate with our board first,''
said BellSouth Chairman John L. Clendenin.
   ``And the plan should provide additional protection to our
shareholders from the negative effects of abusive
share-accumulation tactics. By discouraging abusive tactics, the
plan promotes the fair and equal treatment of all shareholders,''
Clendenin said.
   Under the plan, if any person or group acquires 10 percent of
the company's stock without prior board approval, other
shareholders then would be allowed to buy BellSouth common stock at
half price _ thus diluting the holdings of the potential buyer.
   Atlanta-based BellSouth is the holding company for Southern Bell
and South Central Bell, which serve nine Southeastern states, and
has other business interests including substantial cellular phone
properties.

   The stock market followed through on its
Thanksgiving-week rally with another advance Monday as traders
debated the chances for lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 22.89 points last
week, rose another 19.42 to 2,694.97.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
883 up, 612 down and 489 unchanged.
   The market began to rise last week on signs that the Federal
Reserve was takeing steps for the second time this month to relax
its credit policy.
   That development prompted Fed-watchers to conclude that the
central bank had decided to become more aggressive in its efforts
to cushion the impact of a slowing economy.
   The new trading week began amid talk of impending reductions in
major banks' prime lending rates.
   There was also conjecture that the Fed might make its intentions
clearer before long by cutting the discount rate, the charge it
imposes on loans to private financial institutions.
   That optimism faded a bit in Monday's activity, however, when
Fed dealings in the credit markets suggested that it wasn't as
eager to push rates lower as had been presumed over the weekend.
   Chevron climbed 3\ to 68\ in active trading. The company said it
would create a leveraged employee stock ownership plan financed
with borrowings of about $1 billion.
   General Electric gained 1\ to 61]. GE said it was a buyer of its
shares as part of a recently announced $10 billion repurchase
program slated over the next five years.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose 1 to 46~;
Bristol-Myers Squibb added [ to 56{; Philip Morris was unchanged at
41{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost | to 43[, and
International Business Machines was down 1 at 99].
   Precious-metals issues turned downward as the price of gold gave
up some of its recent gains, falling $5 to $413.90 an ounce on the
Commodity Exchange in New York. ASA Ltd. dropped 1| to 55{; Hecla
Mining } to 15, and Freeport-McMoRan Gold | to 13].
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.39 million
shares, against 86.29 million Friday. Nationwide, consolidated
volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on
regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled
184.35 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $13 billion, or 0.39
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .84 to 191.13.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.90 to 394.88, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.64 at 345.61.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against most major
foreign currencies Monday as traders anticipated a further decline
in interest rates in the United States.
   Gold prices also were mostly lower.
   ``The psychology is definitely bearish for the dollar and
bullish for the (West German) mark,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice
president for foreign exchange at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   Traders expected interest rates to fall in this country in
response to a slowing economy, and to rise in West Germany because
of the continuing political changes in Eastern Europe, Johnson said.
   A nation's currency tends to follow the direction of its
interest rates. Lower U.S. rates make the dollar less attractive,
while higher West German yields make the mark a better investment.
   The dollar's downward trend is expected to remain in place in
the next few weeks unless the Bush administration issues new
statistics indicating strength in the economy, Johnson said.
   When the economy is stronger, the Federal Reserve is more likely
to nudge interest rates higher to prevent it from overheating.
   Traders will be watching as the government issues several
economic reports this week, including third quarter gross national
product figures and personal income, construction spending and the
Index of Leading Indicators for October.
   Overseas dealers also said they expected the dollar to drop
further.
   ``As long as there aren't any major surprises from the interest
rate side, I expect the dollar to move lower under fluctuations,''
said a dealer at a Frankfurt bank.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.7890 West German marks, down from 1.8010;
1.6040 Swiss francs, down from 1.6095; 6.1100 French francs, down
from 6.1415; 1.16665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6725; and
1,320.75 Italian lire, down from 1,326.75.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7900 West German marks, down from 1.8040; 1.6050
Swiss francs, down from 1.6145; 6.1125 French francs, down from
6.1600; 2.0203 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0340; 1,321.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,333.75; and 1.1670 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1665.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 143.35 Japanese yen from
143.80 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 143.40
yen, but in New York, it fell to 143.195 yen from late Friday's
143.60.
   The dollar gained against the British pound, as sterling fell to
$1.5605 from $1.5635 late Friday in London, and to $1.5585 from
$1.5625 late Friday in New York.
   In gold trading in New York, a troy ounce of gold fell $5 to
$413.90 on the Commodity Exchange, while Republic National Bank
quoted a late bid of $413.75 a troy ounce, up 85 cents from late
Friay.
   In earlier London trading, gold fell to a late bid price of
$414.25 a troy ounce from $416.25 bid late Friday and in Zurich,
the metal fell to a closing bid of $414 from $416.10 bid late
Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.12 to close at a bid $418.02.
   Silver dropped 18.4 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $5.69. Earlier in London, silver fell to a late bid
price of $5.73 a troy ounce from late Friday's $5.86.

<BYLINE>Gold Prices Plunge on Profit-Taking ^By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices plummeted Monday amid heavy profit-taking by
speculators as the market broke a five-day runup that had pushed
the metal to its highest levels in almost a year.
   On other commodity markets, cotton futures plunged the permitted
daily limit; soybeans were down sharply; energy futures retreated;
and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.20 to $6.10 lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in December down
$5.20 at $414.10 a troy ounce. Silver fell 18.7 cents to 20.7 cents
with December settling at $5.693 a troy ounce.
   Monday's sell-off was the steepest daily decline in gold prices
since Aug. 4 and the most significant drop since the market began
climbing sharply about six weeks ago from levels near $360 an ounce.
   Analysts said gold had been due for a correction after climbing
so hard, so fast and many remained bullish.
   ``The trend remains intact,'' said James Steel, metals analyst
with the futures brokerage Refco Inc. in New York.
   But they said gold easily could fall a bit further before
resuming its climb, which has been based largely on investment
buying stemming from the uncertain economic outlook, the volatile
stock market and worries about the rapid rate of political change
in Eastern Europe.
   There were no solidly bearish developments Monday to prompt the
gold sell-off, so observers concluded the selling reflected
profit-taking by players who had ridden the market up since
mid-October.
   ``I don't think we're finished yet with the rally in gold or
silver,'' said Jack Barbanel, managing director of First Global
Asset Management Inc. in Princeton, N.J. ``It's healthy for the
market not to overextend itself.''
   Most cotton futures prices fell the daily limit of 2 cents a
pound on the New York Cotton Exchange in a sell-off inspired almost
entirely by technical sell signals in the absence of fresh
supply-and-demand news.
   The trigger was the March contract's drop below the September
low of 72.20 cents early in the session, said Ernest Simon, a
cotton analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``When it came close to it, frantic, panicky selling
developed,'' he said.
   Cotton settled 1.75 cents to 2.33 cents lower with March at
71.08 cents a pound; and the December contract, which has no limit
pending expiration, down 2.33 cents at 67.72 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, led by a steep soybean sell-off linked to slack
export demand and bearish technical signals.
   The wheat market closed narrowly mixed, with support stemming
from Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yuetter's statement that

<HEAD>Georgia-Pacific Seeks Vote To Oust Great Northern Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. said Monday it was
seeking to oust the board of directors of Great Northern Nekoosa
Corp., which has advised shareholders to reject Georgia-Pacific's
$3.6 billion buyout offer.
   Georgia-Pacific stated it was soliciting shareholder consents
for a special meeting at which Great Northern shareholders would
vote on whether to remove the board.
   ``It's clearly time to let Great Northern's shareholders speak
for themselves, since their board obviously does not speak for
them,'' Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. said in a
statement released through his Atlanta headquarters.
   In a separate move, Georgia-Pacific filed motions Monday in U.S.
District Court seeking to force a Great Northern shareholders
meeting to be moved up from March to within the next 30 days.
   Georgia-Pacific also sought to force Great Northern to disclose
to the Securities and Exchange Commission any steps it might be
taking to alter its financial structure and make a takeover more
difficult.
   Great Northern's board on Nov. 21 recommended that stockholders
reject Georgia-Pacific's sweetened buyout offer of $63 a share, or
about $3.6 billion total. Great Northern also had rejected
Georgia-Pacific's initial offer of $58 a share, a total of about
$3.1 billion.
   Great Northern stock rose 12{ cents to $61.62{ a share Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange. Georgia-Pacific rose 37{ cents to
$47.62{ a share.
   Great Northern, based in Norwalk, Conn., and incorporated in
Maine, has refused to negotiate with Georgia-Pacific over either
offer, calling the proposed buyout financially dangerous and
illegal under antitrust law.
   The company issued a news release from its headquarters calling
Georgia-Pacific's court motions ``entirely meritless'' and
self-serving and said it would contest them in court.
   The stepped-up attack on Great Northern came a day before Hahn
was to meet in Augusta with Gov. John R. McKernan and Attorney
General James E. Tierney.
   Maine officials have sought assurances from both companies that
the merger fight would not cost any state residents their jobs or
put valuable woodlands in the hands of developers.
   Hahn has made no promises, saying that because he does not have
access to Great Northern's inside information on its Maine
holdings, he cannot say for sure what Georgia-Pacific will do if it
wins the takeover battle.
   Georgia-Pacific's effort to have shareholders oust Great
Northern's directors is separate from the federal court action.
   Under Maine law, if at least one-third of the shareholders seek
a special meeting for voting on removal of the directors, the
meeting must be called within 60 days.
   The court papers ask that a separate shareholders meeting
already scheduled for March 20 be moved up to within the next 30
days, so shareholders can go ahead and vote on the Georgia-Pacific
offer.
   Georgia-Pacific, in asking for disclosure of any plans by Great
Northern to change its financial structure, also seeks to force
Great Northern to provide 72 hours notice before it makes such
changes.
   Georgia-Pacific's motion stated that Great Northern shareholders
could suffer irreparable harm if the court did not prevent the
company's management from taking further steps to either prevent a
takeover or restructure Great Northern.

<HEAD>Stockholder Seeks Support To Dump UAL Board</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A UAL Corp. stockholder said Monday he had
proposed a shareholder resolution demanding the resignation of
UAL's board of directors, contending they were not acting in the
best interests of the company.
   Professor Paul S. Dempsey, a transportation law expert from the
University of Denver, said he had asked UAL's board to include the
proposed resolution in the proxy statement for the airline
company's annual meeting next spring.
   Dempsey's demand is another sign of discontent among UAL
shareholders, who saw the price of their shares skyrocket several
months ago on takeover overtures only to plummet following a failed
buyout attempt by pilots and management of UAL's United Airlines.
   The investor group Coniston Partners already is asking UAL
shareholders to support its efforts to oust most UAL board members
and replace them with directors who would put the company up for
sale or engage in some other transaction to boost shareholder value.
   Dempsey contends that UAL's directors have become greedy and
should be replaced or forced to take steep pay cuts and lose some
of their self-awarded perquisites.
   ``I'm less concerned with increasing shareholder value in terms
of trying to find another buyout than I am with getting the company
back to running an airline and focused on trying to shore up their
market position,'' Dempsey said in a telephone interview in
Chicago, where he is a visiting professor at DePaul University.
   Dempsey's complaints include the UAL board's decisions in August
and September to award themselves ``golden parachute'' severance
plans consisting of $20,000-a-year lifetime salaries and unlimited
first-class travel benefits for themselves and their spouses. The
board members would have received the benefits whether or not they
continued to serve on the board after the planned pilot-management
buyout.
   The benefits were revoked when the deal collapsed in October due
to a lack of bank financing for the $6.75 billion bid.
   Dempsey also attacked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, who stood to
gain more than $76 million if the deal had gone through.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins declined to comment on Dempsey's
demands. He said UAL's next annual meeting had not been scheduled,
but the meeting usually is held in April.
   UAL's stock fell 87{ cents to $168.75 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Dempsey, who has written several books critical of airline
deregulation, said he has owned 100 shares of UAL for several
years. His ownership of more than $1,000 worth of UAL stock
qualifies him to propose a shareholder resolution, according to
Securities and Exchange Commission rules.
   Under the rules, UAL must publish the resolution in its proxy
statement unless it can persuade the SEC that it fails to meet
certain technical requirements, such as word limits and the timing
of the filing of the proposal.
   Dempsey said he expects UAL to raise objections to his proposal.
He said such resolutions usually are defeated by shareholder votes
if they make it into proxy statements.
   But Dempsey said he hopes to succeed by tapping the
dissatisfaction of other shareholders.
   ``It's a way to get an issue on the front burner of a
corporation and embarrass some board members and get them to act
responsibly, and that is what I'm trying to do with this,'' Dempsey
said.

<HEAD>Department Store Chain To Sell All Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failing Miller &amp; Rhoads department
store chain on Monday abandoned a plan to reorganize under federal
bankruptcy law and said it would seek to sell all its assets.
   The reversal came just four months after the century-old
regional department store sought Chapter 11 protection from
creditors and sought to reorganize as a smaller company.
   ``Certainly everybody in the company is disappointed,''
President John E. Stokely told a news conference at the company's
flagship store in downtown Richmond.
   Stokely said the chain filed a plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court on
Monday that ``contemplates the sale of all assets.''
   He said the company's ``current circumstances and financial
condition led the board of directors to conclude that a
reorganization as a profitable going concern is not feasible.''
   Under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, a company can
function under court protection while it devises a way to pay its
bills.
   Miller &amp; Rhoads had 14 stores in July when it filed for
bankruptcy court protection. Since then, the company has begun
arrangements to rid itself of six of its less profitable stores,
including one in North Carolina. The rest of its stores are in
Virginia.
   Stokely said negotiations are continuing to sell four of the
eight remaining outlets to May Department Stores Co. of St. Louis.
   Stokely said none of the sales transactions would be completed
before the end of January. The chain will operate normally through
the Christmas season, he said.
   Stokely estimated it would take four to six months to complete
the sale of all of 104-year-old Miller &amp; Rhoads assets. He said
jobs should be available to the majority of the company's
approximately 2,000 employees through the sale of the chain's
properties to other retailers.

   Legislators approved major concessions from the
Kremlin on Monday, granting the Baltic republics the right to issue
their own currency and take a share of profits from centrally
controlled factories.
   After four months' work, the Supreme Soviet gave final approval
to a plan launching Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia on the road to
economic autonomy from Moscow beginning Jan. 1.
   In other action, the legislators gave preliminary approval to
the Soviet Union's first law explicitly repudiating years of press
censorship.
   Deputies from the tiny Baltic republic of Estonia smiled, stood
and cheered after the legislature approved the economic
independence measure on a vote of 296-67. Thirty-seven deputies
abstained.
   ``It's a very big step forward,'' Lithuanian Communist Party
chief Algirdas Brazauskas said in an interview after the vote.
   Estonian legislator Mihail Bronshtein, an economist, called the
vote a ``big victory'' for his republic.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who presided at the debate, also
had praise.
   ``We need such a law to move us forward on the road to economic
reform,'' he told more than 400 legislators who had gathered in the
Kremlin.
   His chief economic adviser, deputy Premier Leonid I. Abalkin,
said the Baltics would be taking ``brave radical'' steps and
blasted opponents for a ``presumption of guilt'' that the republics
would take advantage of the law to the detriment of the rest of the
country. He said the government had made several major concessions
in giving up some control of the Baltics' economies that have been
under Moscow's jurisdiction since the Soviet takeover of the
independent states in 1940.
   The law says natural resources in the Baltics, long plundered by
Moscow-controlled ministries, are to be used ``in the interests of
the republics and the union.'' Baltic legislators said this meant
the republics will have the prerogative on how resources are used.
Control of the republics' financial system is to be in the hands of
independent republican banks, except for branches of the Soviet
national bank.
   Abalkin said that provision meant the Baltics could develop
their own currency for use within the republics, although they
would still be required to use the ruble in dealing with the rest
of the country.
   Politicians and economists in the Baltics are considering
setting up their own currencies because the value of the ruble has
plunged, but they indicated the time is not yet ripe to take such a
radical step.
   One deputy said the provision would allow the republics to
create their own ``separate fiefdoms.''
   The law also gives the republics a say over how the incomes of
businesses on its territory is spent, and legislators said this
meant the republics would get half of their profits.
   Control of pipelines and highways running through the Baltics is
to be decided on agreement of the central government and the
republics, but Abalkin said such items would remain in Moscow's
hands.
   A final vote on the bill had been delayed from Friday after a
sharp debate on whether the move amounted to a renewal or an effort
to tear apart the Soviet system.
   A deputy from the Soviet Far East, Nikolai Danilyuk, said Friday
he opposed the bill because ``I would not like to become a
participant in the disintegration of our great state.''
   Gorbachev said Friday the Baltics can move toward economic
independence under the new law only within the framework of the
federation, and all 15 republics will be allowed to have such
status in 1991.
   The law was given preliminary approval in July and sent to
legislative committees for further work.
   The press law, which goes to committees for further work,
declares that ``the press and other mass media are free. Censorship
of the mass media is not permitted.''
   Mass media can be owned and operated by ``government and social
organizations, work collectives, creative unions, religious,
cooperative and other groupings of citizens of the U.S.S.R,'' it
said, greatly loosening the traditionally tight control of the
media.
   It says distribution of materials revealing state secrets,
calling for violence or overthrow of the government, or containing
``propaganda of war, racial, nationalistic, religious exclusivity
or intolerance,'' and pornography can be banned by a prosecutor.
   The Soviet press traditionally has been on a tight rein, and
Communist Party officials frequently have pressured editors to keep
unfavorable materials out. Even before the law was passed, however,
Gorbachev's glasnost policy of openness made many subjects no
longer taboo.
   Gorbachev last month met with newspaper editors and accused them
of giving the impression the country was on the brink of disaster,
hurting his reform effort. He reportedly demanded the firing of at
least one editor, who nevertheless remains at work.

   Rock icon Paul McCartney will be getting a
little help from his friends at Visa U.S.A. during his comeback
tour.
   The credit-card giant announced Monday that it will sponsor the
1990 U.S. portion of the ex-Beatle's concerts.
   McCartney will appear in a multimillion-dollar television
campaign promoting the tour and Visa will be the only credit card
accepted for ticket purchases and stadium souvenirs.
   Although McCartney won't endorse the card directly, he becomes
the latest in a string of rock stars to be connected with
commercial products.
   The Rolling Stones' recent ``Steel Wheels'' tour had a
promotional tie-in that included sponsors such as Anheuser-Busch
Cos., and a licensed clothing line available at J.C. Penney Co.
   McCartney's tour, which also promotes the environmental group
Friends of the Earth, kicked off in September in Europe. His U.S.
outing began last week, although the portion that Visa will sponsor
starts in February and includes 12 dates in six cities.
   McCartney will play at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich., Feb.
1-2; Pittsburgh's Civic Arena Feb. 4-5; the Worcester (Mass.)
Spectrum Feb. 8-9; Rupp Arena in Lexington, Ky., Feb. 11-12;
Indianapolis' Market Square Arena Feb. 14-15; and Atlanta's Omni
Feb. 16-17.
   Visa, based in San Francisco, is the world's largest credit-card
company, with more than 200 million cards worldwide.

   Japan's economy is beginning its fourth year of
expansion, with the current growth period expected to beat the
longest period of postwar growth in May, the Economic Planning
Agency said in a monthly economic report issued Tuesday.
   The third year of sustained economic growth was achieved in
November, the agency said. The longest spell of postwar expansion,
which took place after 1961, lasted 57 months, it said.
   Personal consumption and continuing strong capital equipment
investments by Japanese corporations are expected to continue, with
no overt concerns detected in the economic environment, it said.
   The report represents an amalgamation of previously issued
statistics regarding consumer spending, retail sales and wholesale
prices for the immediately preceding months.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE Nikkei, dollar.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was lower against the Japanese yen
Tuesday morning, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell marginally.
   The dollar, which opened at 143.33 yen, down 0.02 yen from
Monday's finish here, ended morning trading at 143.45 yen. It
ranged from 143.33 to 143.47 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 major issues lost a marginal
9.70 points, or 0.03 percent, ending the morning session at
36,871.83. The index was a 397.6-points gainer Monday, attaining a
record 36,881.53 close.
   The index was lower since the opening because market players
were afraid of a rapid rise in share prices following the hefty
gain the previous day, securities dealers said.
   Satoru Nagayoshi, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.,
attributed the Nikkei's slight loss to technical sellings by Nomura
Securities.
   ``Trading was active,'' he said, mainly because the yen has been
stable on the foreign exchange market.
   Meanwhile, in exchange dealings, the dollar-yen rate moved
narrowly as market players stepped to the sidelines after a similar
wait-and-see mood in New York, said a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The yen remained higher against the dollar as participants
bought it by selling the West German mark for profit-taking, he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The mark has been stronger than almost any other major currency
after the recent reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Since many market players, who expect West Germany will be the
major beneficiary of the movements in Eastern Europe, still have a
large demand for the West German currency, technical selling of the
mark against the yen in Tokyo ``will last only temporarily,'' said
the Bank of Tokyo trader.
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said Tuesday that the
central bank will conduct concerted intervention if the market
continues to fluctuate excessively, Kyodo News Service reported.
