   A complaint by the National Rifle Association
stopped the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from banning the
importation of 25 more models of semiautomatic weapons Thursday, a
newspaper reported.
   The Washington Post, in its Friday editions, said the bureau was
ordered to hold off by Treasury Department officials after the NRA
raised objections.
   The newspaper said senior BATF officials decided at a meeting
Thursday morning to announce the restrictions on the additional
models later in the day, according to an official familiar with the
events. But then they were instructed by the parent Treasury
Department not to proceed, according to the official.
   James Jay Baker, a senior NRA official, said the group learned on
Wednesday night that other weapons might be added to the list of
five types of assault weapons which drug czar William J. Bennett
temporarily banned on Tuesday and contacted Treasury officials who
said there would not be any new restrictions, the newspaper said.
   The ban announced by Bennett included the Chinese-made AK47 and
the Israeli Uzi, and covered about 80 percent of total imports of
semiautomatic weapons.
   ATF then sought to close the door on the semiautomatic weapons
not covered by the initial ban, fearing that these firearms would
fill the void, the Post said. In addition, BATF officials worried
that manufacturers affected by the import ban would complain they
were unfairly singled out.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 140,000 Chinese take their own lives every
year _ most of them women _ and suicide has become a particularly
serious problem among rural women, a Chinese sociologist says.
   Shan Guangnai of the China Academy of Social Sciences said
suicide is the leading cause of abnormal deaths in China, and 70
percent of all victims are female, the official China Daily reported
today.
   ``It used to be a taboo in China to study suicide. Yet in recent
years we are increasingly haunted by the rising problem,'' the paper
quoted her as saying.
   A survey of 10 million people taken by the China Preventive
Medical Science Institute found the suicide rate for urban women to
be 10.2 per 100,000, and for urban men 7.23 per 100,000.
   In rural areas, the suicide rate was 23.34 for women and 18.6 for
men.
   In the United States, the suicide rate is about 12 per 100,000.
   Shan said half the suicides among women are caused by family
disputes and marital problems. He noted factors such as the breakup
of the traditional extended family and lengthy separations as rural
people stream into cities looking for work.
   Rural women are still treated as dependents and men dominate in
the family, Shan said, adding that the psychological and emotional
needs of women are largely ignored.
   He said women also appear to have more difficulty adapting to
rapid changes in China's social values and moral standards brought
about by industrialization and improving living standards.
   Rural women who migrate to the cities looking for work often find
``the sharp contrast is too much for them,'' Shan said. Those who
return to their villages have difficulty adjusting again to rural
poverty.
   Tens of thousands of Chinese committed suicide as a result of
persecution during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
The more recent phenomenon of suicide, linked to changing social
conditions, has only recently begun to be a subject for study.
   In January 1988 the southern city of Canton opened the nation's
first suicide prevention and treatment center.
   In the first year it received about 140 phone calls, 600 letters
and dozens of visitors asking for help, the China Daily said.
   Beijing also opened a suicide prevention center last September.

<HEAD>Women Dominate Cabinet Nominated to Govern West Berlin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leftist coalition that is to run West Berlin
has agreed on a new administration that gives women their first-ever
majority in a West German state governing body.
   The agreement signed Wednesday by the Social Democratic party and
the Alternative List gives women eight posts in the 13-member
Cabinet administering the city-state of West Berlin.
   ``Women capture Berlin's Senate,'' read a front-page headline in
the leftist Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper.
   West Berlin has the status of a state in West Germany's federal
system and its government is formally known as the Senate.
   The government was scheduled to be formally ratified when the
newly elected legislature meets for the first time today.
   The leftist coalition between the Social Democrats and the
Alternative List _ the West Berlin equivalent of the
environmentalist Greens Party _ was formed after voters on Jan. 29
stripped the Christian Democratic Union of its dominant position in
legislature.
   The Christian Democrat's Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right
party, suffered heavy losses in the elections and the party's mayor,
Eberhard Diepgen, was forced to give up his post.
   Diepgen will be replaced by Walter Momper, a Social Democrat.
   The vote left the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats
with 55 seats each in the legislature, while the Alternative List
won 17. The far-right Republicans took 11 seats.
   With neither mainstream party able to muster a majority, the
Social Democrats entered into a power-sharing agreement with the
Alternative List.
   The Alternative List got three government posts under the
agreement and gave all three to women. The Social Democrats named
five more.

   The price of the best seats at the Royal Opera
House, Covent Garden, will rise to about $170 each when Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo sing there next season, general
director Jeremy Isaacs says.
   ``We either charge these prices or we go out of business,''
Isaacs told a news conference Wednesday.
   He said performance standards at one of the world's leading opera
houses need to be improved at a time of falling government subisidy.
Next year's subsidy is $23.6 million _ 40 percent of the Royal
Opera's income and down from 60 percent five years ago.
   Isaacs hopes that Spanish-born tenor Domingo will return in
January to repeat his title role in Giuseppe Verdi's ``Otello,'' and
that Italian tenor Pavarotti will star in Gaetano Donizetti's
``L'elisir d'amore'' in February.
   ``We expect no falling off at the box office,'' Isaacs said.
   The director also announced an 11 percent overall rise on seats
for other than special performances. The best seats will be $140.
Seats at the very top of the house, where only a corner of the stage
can be seen, remain at $4.

<TEXT>
   The three Allied military powers in West Berlin
have abolished a law allowing them to pronounce the death penalty,
erasing a controversial regulation adopted 44 years ago, officials
say.
   No one has ever been executed under the now-defunct law, said a
French military spokesman who requested anonymity. But the continued
existence of the regulation has irritated many West Berliners.
   ``The Allies are conscious of many Berliners' objections'' to the
law, said a statement issued by French military authorities on
Wednesday.
   ``Beginning today ... no person can be sentenced to death because
of violations against the Allies.''
   France, Britain, and the United States officially control West
Berlin under post-war treaties which left the Soviets in charge of
communist East Berlin.
   The French military spokesman said the three Allies were
abolishing the death penalty in West Berlin to ``bring their
regulations into accordance with German law.'' West Germany has no
death penalty.
   The spokesman said the law was aimed at preventing attacks
against Allied soldiers and officials in the years immediately after
Nazi Germany's 1945 defeat.

<TEXT>
   The practice of disposing of pigeons by
burying them alive was suspended after an official of the Humane
Society of the United States contacted the mayor's office.
   Guy Hodge, of the society's Washington headquarters, said he
offered to travel to Lexington and provide a ``blueprint'' for urban
pigeon control that would include alternatives to burying the birds
alive in the county landfill. Hodge said Tuesday that the society
might challenge the practice of burying live birds.
   ``I would say certainly it violates the spirit, if not the
letter, of the anti-cruelty law'' protecting animals in Kentucky,
Hodge said.
   Hodge said he knew of no other place in the nation where pigeons
were buried alive. John Hadidian, an urban wildlife biologist with
the National Park Service in Washington, also said he'd never heard
of such a practice elsewhere.
   Lexington Mayor Scotty Baesler, who was in a meeting Wednesday
afternoon, issued a statement that the burials were suspended. He
said he was unaware of the practice until it was reported Wednesday
in the Lexington Herald-Leader.
   Robert Myers, of the Lexington Humane society, said he was not
aware the birds were being buried alive.
   ``Of course, we see problems with that,'' he said.
   The city had a year-round trapping program and caught about 125
birds a week, said Gayle Wilson, an aide in the Department of Public
Works. He said the pigeons congregate on public buildings and leave
smelly droppings.
   They were removed by city sanitation workers, tied in burlap bags
and taken to the landfill, where the bags were buried.
   Wilson said the method combined ``reasonable humaneness and
convenience.'' The method was inexpensive, but that was not the
deciding factor, he said.
   Hodge said there is no evidence that killing pigeons eliminates
the problem in the long run.
   Instead, the Humane Society advocates taking measures to limit
roosting spots, ``pigeon-proofing'' buildings by placing sharp
spikes on roosting areas, frightening the birds with noisemakers and
passing laws to limit the food supply from citizens, restaurants and
other sources.
   Wilson said it was expensive to pigeon-proof buildings and that
pigeons were smart birds that soon learned to ignore noisemakers and
predator decoys. The only solution is to kill the birds, he said
Tuesday.
   Wilson said that despite the apparent success of a pigeon shoot
Sunday in downtown Somerset in southeast Kentucky, Lexington's
pigeon problem was not bad enough to warrant blocking off downtown
and shooting the birds.
   ``I think the problem would have to be much more serious before
we'd close the downtown and let (hunters) cut loose on them,''
Wilson said.
   Carroll Estes, community development director in Somerset, said
500 to 600 birds, about half the pigeon population there, were
killed in Sunday's shoot, and he expected half that many to be
killed in a shoot scheduled Saturday.
   Hodge said he had been trying Wednesday to contact Somerset
officials to offer them a similar plan for pigeon control but had
been unsuccessful.
   Estes, who said he planned no further shoots after Saturday
because of ``the media aggravating you to death,'' said he
considered the method more humane than live burial.
   ``I'm not out here choking ours to death,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A gay man who becomes infected with the AIDS
virus stands a 50-50 chance of going nearly 10 years without
developing the disease, suggests a study reported today.
   The virus may incubate at least 9.8 years in half the gay men it
infects, some two years longer than other recent studies suggested,
according to the analysis of AIDS among gay men in San Francisco.
   If infected people are given AZT or an aerosol form of the drug
pentamidine to stave off development of AIDS, the interval may run
longer, said researcher Andrew Moss.
   He and colleague Peter Bacchetti of the University of California,
San Francisco, and San Francisco General Hospital present the work
in today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   The study represents a new approach to estimating AIDS incubation
time, and ``it's good work,'' John Kalbfleisch of the University of
Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, said Wednesday.
   Kalbfleisch, a statistics professor who has done similar
research, said incubation estimates are uncertain because too little
time has passed since the earliest AIDS infections to give a clearer
picture.
   For the new work, researchers compared infection rates among San
Francisco gay men since 1978 to monthly totals of new cases of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The analysis estimated incubation times that would be consistent
with the two sets of data. It was not designed to determine the
fraction of infected men who would eventually get AIDS, Moss said.
   He said he believed incubation periods seen among people who were
infected by transfusions will eventually approach the 9.8-year
figure.
   The work suggests that the number of new AIDS cases among San
Francisco gay men will decline after this year, Moss said. Other
studies suggest the number of new infections started to decline
after 1982, he said.
   Several teams of researchers had previously estimated AIDS
incubation times.
   Last year, Kalbfleisch and colleague J.F. Lawless suggested that
half of adults infected by tainted blood transfusions may still be
free of AIDS 7.3 years after infection. Also last year, researchers
at the Centers for Disease Control and the San Francisco Department
of Public Health estimated an average incubation of 7.8 years among
84 gay men.
   A British economist suggested a 15-year average incubation period
in a 1987 analysis of blood transfusion data, but his study has
since been criticized by other scientists, Kalbfleisch and Bacchetti
said. Another transfusion study that year estimated an eight-year
average.
   A report by the Institute of Medicine estimated that 25 percent
to 50 percent of infected people will develop AIDS in five to 10
years.
   AIDS has struck 87,188 Americans and killed 49,976 since June
1981, according to the most recent CDC figures. Sixty-one percent of
cases have occurred in gay or bisexual males.
   The AIDS virus is called human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. It
is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes
shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from
pregnant women to their offspring.

   Studies of a protein that prevents the most
common kind of muscular dystrophy should be aided by today's report
of a way to isolate the substance from muscle tissue, researchers
say.
   Scientists do not yet know what the protein does in muscle
tissue. But its absence causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most
common and severe kind of dystrophy.
   Isolation of the protein from rabbit muscle is reported in
today's issue of the British journal Nature by Kevin Campbell and
Steven Kahl at the University of Iowa College of Medicine in Iowa
City.
   They said the isolation method should help research into the
protein, called dystrophin.
   The new study found dystrophin was tightly bound to a second
protein. The results suggest the combination of the two proteins may
be important for normal muscle structure or function, the
researchers said.
   Duchenne dystrophy is a genetic disorder that strikes boys almost
exclusively, appearing in about one in every 3,500 male births in
the United States. It causes a progressive weakening and wasting of
voluntary muscles.
   Most patients die in their early 20s.

   John G. Tower has fallen, but the sky has not.
   For all the forecasts of dire results if the Senate blocked
Tower's path to the Pentagon, business is proceeding as usual.
President Bush said the case was closed and accepted Democratic
assurances of future cooperation.
   That doesn't undo the resentment among some of Tower's more
ardent Republican allies in the Senate and in some corners of the
White House. Bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded
like assurances of support from a dozen Senate Democrats. They ended
up with only three Democrats in the close-to-party-line vote against
Tower.
   Nevertheless, a week after the former Texas senator was denied
confirmation as secretary of defens, the waters have closed.
   There will be ripples, and some of them could be wave-sized. The
good-behavior rules set in the debate over Tower's drinking habits
and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be
invoked as precedents whenever Republicans spot a Democratic target.
   ``We've established what will be known as the Tower standards,''
said Sen. John Warner, R-Va.
   That argument will be used by House Republicans challenging the
financial conduct of House Speaker Jim Wright. But it will be a
debating point, not a turning point, in a Wright controversy that
was ordained long before the Tower episode.
   While President Bush was unwavering in his support of Tower, he
burned no bridges to congressional Democrats. He insisted that Tower
was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his
choice, even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed. But
he didn't get nasty about it, saying there was no point in
escalating the fight.
   ``That's over,'' he said 24 hours after the Tower defeat.
``That's history. And now we are going to go forward.''
   The 53-47 vote against Tower was a setback to Bush in the sense
that it always is a defeat when Congress denies a president
something he wants. But this denial did not cost Bush a program, or
a major campaign pledge, or the support of voters.
   Indeed, it could turn out that the Senate did the president a
favor by sending Tower back to Texas instead of to the Pentagon. It
was a break Bush could not make with a political ally who had been
after the Pentagon job since Ronald Reagan was elected president.
   Tower had not been a Reagan man _ he had supported Bush for the
1980 nomination. And the Reagan White House went to some lengths to
rule the senator out of the job he sought, declaring that the new
president would not be nominating any Senate Republican for any
Cabinet post.
   After Tower's long wait, Bush displayed his own loyalty, all the
way to a losing vote when the standard, somewhat safer course would
have been to withdraw the nominee. Tower not only shunned
withdrawal; he offered conditions that had to be humiliating, if
only the Senate would let him have the job.
   Tower promised to quit drinking, taking the pledge on national
television. And when that didn't work, he offered to become the
first-ever probationary Cabinet member. Republicans proposed that he
get the job for a six-month trial and then return for
reconfirmation, a gimmick that would have changed the system and
could have haunted the presidency.
   No deal. So Tower became the ninth Cabinet nominee ever to be
rejected, the first who was a former senator.
   Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to
appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have
raised the political stakes.
   Tower did not restrain himself. Battling for the job, he said
withdrawal would damage Bush and rejection would be ``damning the
president's judgment.'' He said his nomination had been turned into
a vehicle for a major presidential defeat.
   Tower's advocates on the Senate floor said grave constitutional
issues were at stake, that the authority of the presidency was on
the line, that the Senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the
Tower decision.
   But Bush said all along that the outcome, either way, would not
hurt on other issues.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee and the
pivotal figure in the Tower defeat, agreed. He told his Georgia
constituents that the Tower rejection would not hurt Bush's
leadership.
   ``In Washington, `triumphs' and `setbacks' are short-lived,''
Nunn said, ``and that's particularly true of the president.''

<HEAD>Plan to Close More Than 100 Local Offices Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Weather Service is promising
better forecasts and fewer false alarms when it completes a
reorganization program officials say will close more than 100 local
offices.
   A giant supercomputer, an array of new high-tech radar and
automated data collection systems will allow the agency to operate
with 800 fewer workers and 115 local offices rather than the
approximately 250 now open, says NWS Director Elbert W. Friday.
   Friday said the agency hopes to complete the modernization
program by 1995, but promised that no local office will be closed
until officials are convinced they can do so without hurting local
forecast and warning services.
   Staff cuts will be handled through normal attrition, Friday said,
with no current workers expected to lose their jobs. The program is
expected to reduce the overall staff from 4,700 people to about
3,900 when it is completed.
   Despite the NWS assurances on Wednesday, the plan is likely to
provoke criticism from some members of Congress. Reports earlier
this month that some NWS offices might be closed led to quick
complaints from senators and representatives anxious to preserve
jobs and facilities in their home states.
   Friday said a list of the 115 communities expected to retain
offices would be made public. However, NWS spokesmen later told
reporters that the Commerce Department had nixed that plan and the
list would not be released.
   Friday said the improved technology, some of which is being
tested in Norman, Okla., is expected to improve forecasting of
severe storms from 60 percent accuracy to 80 percent. That should
reduce false alarms an equal amount, he said.
   He said the automated data collection and processing system will
first be installed in Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Colorado and
will be expanded to the remainder of the country once it is proven
effective.
   Major components of the new system will be:
   _The Next Generation Weather Radar, which will provide more
detailed analysis of storms than current radar, which was installed
in the 1960s. The new radar can detect wind direction, improving the
ability to see tornadoes before they touch the ground, Friday said.
   _The Automated Surface Observing System, which will replace many
current weather service offices with computerized stations that
continually measure temperature, humidity, rainfall, cloud height,
wind and visibility. These stations will send data now collected by
people to central offices for use in writing forecasts.
   _A supercomputer will be installed at the National Meteorological
Center in Camp Springs, Md., to provide detailed forecasts twice a
day to weather service offices for use in preparing local forecasts.
   _The Advance Weather Interactive Processing System, an upgraded
computer forecasting system to be installed in all 115 local offices.
   The National Weather Service Employees Organization, however, was
critical of the plan, saying the new equipment hasn't been proven
effective.
   While NWS officials declined to provide either a list of weather
offices to be closed or those to be kept open, an unofficial map was
obtained indicating 113 sites in the 48 contiguous states expected
to retain weather forecasting offices. Some locations are
approximate, with final decisions yet to be made.
   The preliminary list includes:
   Alabama _ Birmingham and Mobile.
   Arkansas _ Little Rock.
   Arizona _ Flagstaff, Phoenix, Tucson and Yuma.
   California _ San Diego, Los Angeles, San Joaquin Valley, San
Francisco Bay area, Sacramento Valley, Eureka.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is urging aviation
authorities to restrict flights over its military nuclear reactors
to make them more secure against potential terrorist attack.
   ``We've got a lot to do in that area,'' Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins told a House Budget subcommittee Wednesday. ``It's going to
be some time before we get this completely closed.''
   The issue was raised by Sen. Jim Exon, D-Neb., during a hearing
in which Watkins pledged to give top priority to modernizing and
cleaning up the department's nuclear weapons complex, which includes
16 major facilities in 12 states.
   Exon said he was stunned to read a recent report that there are
no effective restrictions on airplane flights over the Savannah
River plant near Aiken, S.C., whose reactors are the nation's only
source of a gas used in nuclear warheads. Those reactors currently
are not operating because of safety problems.
   ``If there is one place where we have fallen down on what is A,
B, C in security, it is in this area,'' Exon said.
   Savannah River also includes an Energy Department research
laboratory, a plant that makes naval reactor fuel material, two
chemical separation plants and a facility that produces weapon-grade
plutonium.
   The only nuclear weapons plant that now has prohibited airspace
is the Pantex plant near Amarillo, Texas, which is the final weapons
assembly point.
   The Charlotte Observer reported in last Sunday's editions that
classified security reports obtained by the newspaper in a Freedom
of Information Act request showed Savannah River officials had
repeatedly urged the Federal Aviation Administration to ban
low-altitude flights over the 300-square-mile facility.
   The FAA said the Energy Department had failed to justify the need
for the restrictions, which the aviation agency views as excessive.
   Watkins said he was personally involved in trying to establish
the air restrictions, not only at Savannah River but also at other
sensitive weapons plants.
   ``We've got to take a look all around,'' he said, to find ways of
better protecting the weapons complex from possible air attacks by
terrorists or damage from a crash.
   ``I believe with the new secretary of transportation and with my
personal friend coming into the FAA, I don't see any problem getting
it reestablished,'' Watkins said.
   Although he was not more specific, Watkins, a retired admiral,
apparently was referring to recent reports that Adm. James D. Busey
IV, commander of naval forces in Europe since March 1987, would be
named FAA administrator.
   The FAA said Wednesday the Bush administration had not yet
nominated anyone for the job.
   The Observer report said that last September, the Energy
Department dropped its 1983 request to prohibit flights below 14,000
feet for Savannah River and eight other weapons sites. The agency
settled for a 2,000-foot minimum limit at Savannah River. That
restriction, however, is voluntary and not enforceable, the report
said.

<HEAD>Baker Plays Down Suggestion that Israel and PLO Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid Israeli complaints, Secretary of State
James A. Baker III is playing down his suggestion that direct talks
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization may be
needed if alternate peace efforts fail.
   Baker told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations Wednesday that an Israeli-PLO dialogue was difficult to
foresee but should not ``categorically'' be ruled out.
   This represented a shift in tone from Tuesday when he told a
House subcommittee that if talks between Israel and non-PLO
Palestinians do not prosper, ``I suppose we would then have to see
negotiations between Israelis and representatives of the PLO.''
   Baker's remark triggered a telephone call from Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens, who told the secretary that the statement was
``damaging'' to the prospects for a dialogue between Israel and
non-PLO Palestinians. Arens, here for official talks, disclosed the
phone call to Israeli reporters.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Baker's
statement was an ``open invitation'' for the PLO to engage in
terrorist activities against Palestinians who choose to bargain with
Israel.
   Baker replied that he only meant to say in his earlier remarks
that an Israeli-PLO dialogue should not be ``categorically,
absolutely, totally and completely'' ruled out ``under any and all
circumstances,'' because it might help the peace process.
   The comment did not repudiate what he had said Tuesday but there
was a clear change in emphasis.
   Israel has steadfastly refused to talk to the PLO and says the
dialogue the United States opened with the PLO last December has
strengthened the group's hand.
   Arens accused the PLO on Tuesday of committing the ``worst
atrocities we've ever seen since World War II.''
   In his remarks Wednesday, Baker seemed to hold out little hope
that an international conference on the Middle East, advocated by
many Arab states, could make a significant contribution to peace.
   What is needed instead, Baker said, are ``mutually reciprocal and
reinforcing steps'' by both Israel and the Palestinians to build
confidence.
   ``Both sides have to take steps,'' he said.
   The mood at the hearing was generally friendly but there were
some hints that President Bush may encounter some resistance,
especially on Central American policy.
   Subcommittee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the only aid
package he could support for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels would be
one leading to their resettlement in Nicaragua or elsewhere from the
base camps where they now are housed in Honduras.
   Baker said he believes the Contras should remain intact at least
until national elections are held in Nicaragua next February. He
implied that the rebels could then be reintegrated into Nicaragua if
the elections are fair.
   The administration is expected to seek a humanitarian aid package
for the Contras in the $40 million to $50 million range in the next
few days.
   On El Salvador, Leahy said that if the rightist ARENA party wins
presidential elections there on Sunday, future U.S. aid to that
country should carry strict conditions because of the ties he said
ARENA has with death squad activities.
   Baker replied that it would be a mistake to exaggerate the size
of the death squad problem, contending that politically motivated
murders averaged 800 per month in 1981 and 1982 compared with 280
per year at present.
   He added, however, that the administration is aware of continuing
human rights problems in El Salvador, recalling that Vice President
Dan Quayle raised that issue with Salvadoran officials during a
visit there six weeks ago.

<HEAD>House Committee Approves Uniform Poll Closing Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sponsor of legislation that would establish
a uniform closing time for polls in 48 of the 50 states says he
expects full House approval of the bill as early as next month.
   On Wednesday, the House Administration Committee approved the
measure on a voice vote.
   Rep. Al Swift, sponsor of the bill, said he expects the House to
approve the measure in early April, but House Speaker Jim Wright has
indicated passage could come before the Easter recess which begins
March 24.
   Election officials in the West have charged that the early
projection of the winner in the presidential race discourages people
from voting in their states and the drop in turnout had affected the
outcomes of close local races.
   Swift, D-Wash., has said previously that studies have shown voter
turnout can drop by as much as 2 percent in states where the polls
are still open but the winner in a presidential contest is known.
   ``With passage of this legislation we will be one step closer to
preserving the integrity of election day not only in the West, but
across the country,'' said Swift.
   Swift's bill was similar to ones approved by the House twice
before, but both times the Senate failed to act. A different version
of a uniform poll closing bill is before the Senate Rules Committee.
   Under Swift's bill, polls would close simultaneously across the
country at 9 p.m. EST on election day. In the Pacific time zone,
daylight-saving time would be extended for a maximum of two weeks in
presidential election years. The extension would allow polls in that
time zone to close at 7 p.m. PDT.
   Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the legislation, but could
change their poll closing times if desired.
   Swift said the need for a uniform closing time became apparent
with the 1980 election when television networks projected the
results based on exit polling hours before the polls on the West
Coast closed.
   The networks have since agreed not to project election results in
a state where the polls haven't closed, but in 1988 the problem was
different as President Bush rolled up a large electoral college
majority before Western polls closed.
   Swift said his uniform poll closing bill ``will ensure that
voters in all regions of the country will be able to cast their
ballots without being told who won the election.
   ``The networks held to their part of the bargain last November,
now it is up to the House and Senate to send this legislation to the
president.''
   While a version of a poll closing bill cleared the Senate Rules
Commitee late last year, Congress adjourned before the the full
Senate had an opportunity to act.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., has introduced legislation that avoids
a change in daylight-saving time and simply calls for the polls to
close at 7 p.m. Pacific time, 8 p.m. Mountain time, 9 p.m. Central
time and 10 p.m. Eastern time.
   Barbara Smith, an Adams spokeswoman, said the chairman of the
rules committee, Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., has indicated he expects
Adams' bill to clear the panel in early April.

   Thousands of people, some chanting
``Russians go home,'' marched in twilight across the Danube River to
demand Hungary's full independence and celebrate its first small
steps toward democracy.
   An estimated 100,000 people took to the streets of the capital on
Wednesday to mark Hungary's 1848 revolt against Austrian rule, an
anniversary that has become a symbol for reformers demanding greater
freedoms.
   Unlike in previous years, when authorities cracked down on
celebrations, the anniversary this year was declared a public
holiday and both government and opposition rallies took place
peacefully across the nation.
   In Budapest, thousands of people sporting national emblems
marched, listened to poetry and folk songs and chanted slogans
during rallies and other events held throughout the day.
   Crowds applauded calls for an independent Hungary, the withdrawal
of Soviet troops, free elections and a multi-party system and
expressed solidarity with jailed activists in neighboring East bloc
countries.
   A five-hour march through the capital to symbolic sites of the
1848 revolution, which Austria crushed in 1849 with the help of
Russian troops, was followed in the evening by a candlelight
procession across a Danube bridge and up a steep road to the Castle
Hill.
   Police made no move all day to interfere with the marchers.
   Pro-democracy activist Sandor Szilagyi, one of the organizers of
Wednesday's mass march through the capital, said this was a sign the
Communist Party was sincere about taking steps toward democracy.
   In past years, large numbers of police escorted demonstrators at
unofficial gatherings or forcibly dispersed them and detained
protest leaders. In 1986, the State Department protested violent a
police crackdown on a March 15 rally.
   In a further sign of Hungary's recent reforms and greater
independence from Moscow, no Soviet-style red flags hung anywhere in
the capital for the first time on any national holiday in three
decades.
   The day amounted to one of the biggest outpourings of nationalist
pride since another unsuccessful Hungarian revolt, the anti-Soviet
uprising of 1956, was crushed by Russian tanks.
   Miklos Tamas-Gaspar, a leader of the opposition Federation of
Free Democrats, told the crowd gathered before the candlelight march
that March 15 was not only a celebration of 1848, but also of 1956.
   ``The aim is the same,'' he said. ``Constitutional democracy and
national independence.''
   Wednesday night, a crowd estimated by Western reporters and
independent activists to be about 80,000 to 100,000 marched across
the river to the castle, with some chanting ``Russians go home.''
   Themes of democracy and independence marked events throughout the
day, as Hungarians celebrated the newly recognized holiday and
recent reforms endorsed by Parliament that could usher in a bona
fide multi-party system.
   Denes Csengey, a popular leader of one of the largest independent
groups, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, told a cheering crowd that
March 15 should not be the only day of freedom.
   He spoke in front of the television headquarters where children
stood underneath a banner which read ``Free Hungarian Television.''
   Referring to a decision by independent groups not to accept an
invitation by Communist leaders to celebrate jointly, Csengey said
the separate celebrations did not mean ``we don't wish to work
toward national unity.''

   Scientists missed by 150 years in dating the
oldest known reliable record of a total solar eclipse, a clay tablet
that also reflects fear among the ancient observers, researchers
said today.
   Scientists had concluded about 20 years ago that the eclipse,
recorded on a clay tablet found in Syria, occurred on May 3, 1375
B.C.
   But in today's issue of the British journal Nature, two Dutch
scientists report their analysis shows the eclipse really happened
about 150 years later, on March 5, 1223 B.C.
   The tablet was found in 1948 in the ruins of Ugarit, an ancient
city near Syria's Mediterranean coast. One side appears to tell of a
solar eclipse, and the reverse side reads, ``Two livers were
examined: danger.''
   ``Apparently the anxiety caused by the eclipse of the Sun and the
sudden appearance of Mars had to be resolved by an explanation
through liver divination,'' wrote the researchers from the
University of Amsterdam and Leiden University.
   They concluded that the earlier text analysis of the tablet
misidentified the time of year in which the eclipse occurred. The
new study indicated the eclipse really happened in late February or
early March.
   In addition, the text apparently indicates that Mars was visible
at the time of the eclipse, the Dutch researchers said.
   They compared those criteria and the likely age range for the
tablet to a list of possible total solar eclipses visible from
Ugarit. Only the event in 1223 B.C. fills the bill, the researchers
said.
   In an accompanying editorial, Christopher B.F. Walker of the
British Museum in London cautioned that their conclusion ``can best
be regarded as a plausible hypothesis.''
   The translation of the tablet's text is not certain, and the
study assumes that citizens of Ugarit followed an Egyptian-style
calendar, for which no supporting evidence is available, he said.
   Even if the tablet is 150 years younger than previously believed,
it would remain the oldest known reliable record of a total solar
eclipse, Edwin Krupp, director of the Griffith Observatory in Los
Angeles, said in a telephone interview.
   The next-oldest record was made in China in the Eighth Century
B.C., said Krupp, a researcher in ancient astronomy.

   Actress Angela Lansbury says she has relied on
cosmetic surgery for more than 20 years to help her remain a leading
lady.
   The most recent operation was a 1986 neck tuck, she said in
April's McCall's magazine. This, along with losing 20 pounds,
enabled the 63-year-old actress to spruce up Jessica Fletcher, the
mystery writer she portrays in the ``Murder, She Wrote'' television
series.
   She said she had a facelift before opening in 1966 in ``Mame,''
the role for which she won the first of her four Tony awards.
   The next surgery was in 1969 ``to get rid of the little puffy
bags that I'd always had under my eyes,'' she said.
   She said she had her neck and chin redone in 1976.
   She said she wanted to talk openly about the operations because
``cosmetic surgery shouldn't be just the secret of actresses and
socialites now that it's available to anyone who wants it and can
afford it.''

   Actor Dustin Hoffman has postponed his British
stage debut in ``The Merchant of Venice'' to stay with his
81-year-old father, who is in a coma in California.
   Rehearsals were to start Wednesday in the southwest England city
of Bath, but Hoffman flew to the United States, said Lee Gottsegen,
a spokesman for the family. The play was to have a two-week run in
May before moving to London's West End.
   ``Dustin is by his father's bedside. He is taking things day by
day at the moment. We do not know what is going to happen next,''
Gottsegen said.
   The actor's father, Harry Hoffman, suffered a stroke two weeks
ago, the spokesman said.

   Actress Shelly Long, mother of a 4-year-old
daughter, says she was adamant when she first told her husband that
she wouldn't have children.
   ``In fact, it was the source of one of our first big arguments,''
Long said in April's McCall's magazine. ``I said, `Look, I've wanted
to have a career all my life. And now that it's taken off, I'm not
going to give it up to have a baby.'''
   Long said she and Bruce Tyson ``made a contract that he would
consider not having children and marrying me anyhow ... and that I
would consider having children.
   ``I don't think Bruce ever kept his part of the deal. But you
know what? I'm really glad he didn't. Juliana, she's the very
best,'' Long said of her daughter.

   Former President Reagan visited his
mountaintop ranch for the first time since leaving the White House
and went for a trail ride atop a gift horse, a spokesman said.
   Reagan and his wife, Nancy, arrived at their 635-acre Rancho del
Cielo on Tuesday and were to stay through Friday, said Mark
Weinberg, spokesman for the ex-president.
   Upon their arrival, Reagan was presented with a black
thoroughbred measuring 16.2 hands, a gift from the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, Weinberg said.
   The horse was given to Reagan to acknowledge ``the close
friendship'' the Canadian government feels toward the 40th
president, Weinberg said.
   ``He rode it for the first time on Wednesday and he enjoyed it
very much,'' the spokesman said.

   A former ballet dancer who says she is William
Hurt's common-law wife wants ``equitable distribution'' of the
actor's multimillion-dollar holdings, her lawyer said.
   Hurt is worth about $10 million, said A. Richard Golub, attorney
for Sandra Jennings.
   Ms. Jennings said she and Hurt's 5-year-old son are living in
near poverty. She had been asking $16,000 a month alimony and child
support but now wants what a wife would be entitled to, Golub said.
   Ms. Jennings said she and Hurt lived together for months in
Beaufort, S.C., during the filming of ``The Big Chill'' in 1982.
   New York does not recognize common-law marriages but South
Carolina does.
   Hurt married Heidi Henderson, daughter of band leader Skitch
Henderson, two weeks ago.
   Hurt reportedly had been giving Ms. Jennings about $60,000 a year.
   Hurt's lawyer, Joel Papernack, could not be reached for comment;
calls to his office were not answered.

   As his only non-family, non-official guest on
becoming secretary of veterans affairs, Edward J. Derwinski chose
World War II cartoonist Bill Mauldin, who says the new department
``sounds like the same old bureaucracy under a different name.''
   Mauldin, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, created the bedraggled
dogfaces Willie and Joe for the soldier's newspaper ``Stars and
Stripes.''
   ``Willie and Joe told the truth of the war, World War II, and the
fatigue, sadness, anxiety and humor of the period,'' Derwinski said
in his remarks on the White House South Lawn, with Mauldin close to
him on the podium.
   Mauldin, 67, was a constituent when Derwinski represented the
South Side of Chicago during 12 terms in Congress.
   During an interview before Wednesday's ceremony, Mauldin said he
knew Derwinski only slightly, and did not know whose idea it was to
make him a prominent part of the day's events.
   Mauldin carries a few more pounds and gray hairs than he did in
slogging his way up the Italian peninsula in 1943-1944, where he
collected a minor shoulder wound from a German mortar round that
inspired one of his best panels _ Soldier, standing, to medic,
seated at a table with boxes of medals before him: ``Just gimme the
aspirin. I already got a purple heart.''
   He told two reporters, one from Stars and Stripes, ``I can't help
thinking Derwinski knows my attitude'' as an opponent of the large,
main-line veterans groups and of what he saw as their grasping
attitude.
   ``We were against the special philosophy, if you're a veteran
you're a special case,'' he said. ``Just by virtue of being a
veteran, I don't think that entitles a guy to a gravy-train ride for
the rest of his life.''
   Mauldin belonged to the tiny American Veterans Committee, serving
two terms as chairman, and has not used any veterans benefits.
   ``We backed the GI bill, but our slogan was, `Citizens First,
Veterans Second,''' he said. ``I haven't paid dues for years, but
they still send me mail.
   ``There are millions of guys for whom the military experience was
the one great experience of their lives. I don't blame them for
wanting to sit around on a Saturday night with their friends and
tell lies about their experience.''
   Mauldin said he had not paid close attention to veterans affairs
recently, so his opinions had to be tentative.
   _Agent Orange: Veterans are being forced to try to prove
illnesses are connected to exposure to that defoliant, but ``the
burden of proof ought to be on the government. Those kids ought to
have it made up to them. I'm very much in favor of a liberal hand''
in compensation.
   _A Cabinet department replacing the old Veterans Administration:
``It sounds like the same bureaucracy under a different name. ...
maybe it will be entirely different.''
   He was not at all tentative on universal service.
   ``I think it's great, the idea of putting two or three years of a
young man's (or woman's) life into public service,'' he said.
   ``If you're not inclined to the military, then CCC-type work.''
   The CCC was the Civilian Conservation Corps, a depression-era
agency tha provided jobs, clothes and food for young men in camps
working on conservation projects.
   ``I think everyone owes his country a few years out of his life,
just a short period, two years, maybe three.''
   The point of this, he said, is to ``make better citizens out of
them .. bond them to their country.''
   Though many proponents of universal service have said the ending
of the draft in 1973 ended valuable lessons in democracy through the
military's mixing of classes, races and viewpoints, Mauldin said he
thought ``the sociology is obviously a side benefit.''
   Mauldin himself enlisted in the New Mexico National Guard in
1940, more than a year before the entry of the United States into
World War II, because, ``I had some friends in the unit I wanted to
be with. ... I wanted to get into something, not out of something.''
   Which started his cartoonist juices flowing: ``I don't want to
pick on Danny Boy,'' he said with a grin, recalling cartoons of last
fall's campaign lambasting the Vietam-era plunge into the Indiana
National Guard of Vice President Dan Quayle.

   The Roman Catholic church where
parishioners rebelled over the removal of a Polish priest has
reopened, but church authorities revealed that the priest has been
suspended by his superiors.
   Police have guarded St. Michael the Archangel church since it was
closed Feb. 18 by Bishop Edward Egan after a weeklong sit-in by
about 200 dissidents upset over the sudden, unexplained ouster of
the Rev. Roman Palaszewski.
   There were relatively few worshipers Wednesday at four early
morning Masses, two celebrated in English and two in Polish, said
the Rev. James Smyka, associate pastor.
   ``It was very, very emotional,'' Smyka said. ``The 6:30 Mass _ I
think I cried through half of it. It was just so good to be back in
the church. I mean, that's what our business is as priests.''
   Some parishioners said they were overjoyed by the church's
reopening. Some said they heard about it by word-of-mouth, or by
making daily drives by the church since the announcement that it
would reopen.
   Monsignor Nicholas Grieco, a spokesman for Egan, said Wednesday
that Palaszewski was suspended indefinitely for defying orders from
his Franciscan superiors in Krakow, Poland, to return to Poland last
month.
   ``He's still ordained, but he cannot function as a priest because
he didn't obey his superior who commanded him, under obedience, to
return to Poland,'' Grieco said ``He would not be able to say Mass
or administer the sacraments.''
   Palaszewski, who spent three years at the church under an
agreement between his superiors in Poland and Franciscan officials
in Baltimore, has been in seclusion in the Bridgeport area since his
removal in December.
   About 50 worshipers attended a Lenten prayer service Wednesday
evening. They entered the church under the watchful eye of a police
officer sitting in a van parked discreetly across the street.
   Four or five dissidents watched quietly from across the street
Wednesday evening as worshipers entered the church.
   They then gathered at a Polish club a block from the church to
plan a demonstration outside the church this weekend on Palm Sunday,
the start of the holiest week in the church year.
   ``They didn't heal our wounds _ everything is the same,'' said
Genevieve Kozlowski, a parishioner for 25 years and one of the
protest leaders.
   She was unaware of Wednesday's opening, but said she and many
other protesters plan to boycott services because they don't believe
their complaints have been addressed, Kozlowski said.
   The dissidents are demanding Palaszewski's return to the parish
and the removal of the church's pastor, the Rev. John Bambol, who
they claim engineered Palaszewski's removal because of his
popularity among recent immigrants.
   They also question Bambol's commitment to maintaining the
church's Polis traditions.
   Bambol's supporters have said Palaszewski paid scant attention to
parishioners who were not recent immigrants.
   A weeklong sit-in by about 200 dissidents who occupied the church
in shifts ended early Feb. 18 when church authorities summoned
police to expel them. Two who refused to leave voluntarily were
charged with trespassing.
   Egan suspended Masses indefinitely the same day.
   Bambol said after the prayer service that the dissidents are
welcome to return as long as they ``abide by the rules of the
church.'' He said he was ``very joyful, very happy'' that the church
had reopened.
   ``After all we were all suffering for so long unjustifiably ...
we are happy to be back in harness, so to speak,'' he said. ``This
is a period of reconciliation.''

<TEXT>
   A U.S. gunmaker is suspending sales of a
semiautomatic assault-style rifle following imposition of an import
ban on similar foreign-made firearms frequently used by drug dealers.
   ``We want to conform to the spirit of the law although we weren't
specifically mentioned in the letter of the law,'' Colt Industries
Inc spokesman Mike Dunn said Wednesday after announcing the
voluntary suspension of sales of the company's AR15, a semiautomatic
version of the military's M-16.
   The action came one day after the Bush administration announced a
ban on imports of several foreign-made semiautomatic weapons that
police say have contributed to a nationwide wave of drug-related
killings. Calls for controls also increased after an assault rifle
was used in the California schoolyard attack that killed five
children earlier this year.
   Administration officials said the move may just be temporary, but
that with import applications skyrocketing, they wanted to head off
an imminent surge of the deadly firearms entering the country.
   Colt's voluntary move to halt AR15 sales was lauded by William J.
Bennett, the nation's drug control director, as ``an act of civic
responsibility.''
   Dick Pedersen of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms added, ``It's amazing how this thing is just
taking off.''
   Bennett on Tuesday announced the suspension of pending import
permits for more than 110,000 semiautomatic rifles until the ATF can
review if their intended use fits the requirement that they be sport
weapons.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesday if the
president would expand the review to domestic models, said, ``There
are no plans of that kind anticipated.''
   But Dunn said Colt will permanently halt sales of the AR15 to
civilians ``if it is determined by the government review that
semiautomatic rifles are not appropriate for the commercial
market.'' He would not reveal how many of the rifles Colt makes.
   Gregg Risch of Handgun Control, one of the country's leading gun
control advocates, called the move by Colt ``unprecedented.''
   But when asked about the possible impact on crime, Risch said,
``Zero.''
   ``There are a couple of million of them already out on the
streets, gun stores already have large stocks of ones already
imported and domestically made ones, and yesterday's action doesn't
do anything to stop them from selling those,'' Risch said.
   Gwynne Peirson, retired professor of criminology at Howard
University and a police officer for 23 years in Oakland, Calif.,
said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact, but
ultimately could if it is made permanent.
   ``It will have to trickle down and we may not even see the impact
next year,'' he said. ``The only thing the ban will do in the short
run is to increase the price of the available weapons.''
   The National Rifle Association said halting imports will have
little impact on crime. It said the government is targeting
law-abiding citizens and their guns, not criminals who will ignore
gun-control laws anyway.
   ``If we leave this guy out on the street, he operates outside of
all of our laws and he sneers at society and he's going to be a
major problem,'' said Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA
Institute for Legislative Action.
   The Colt AR15 is the most similar U.S.-made weapon to those
covered by the import ban, such as semiautomatic versions of AK-47s
and Uzi carbines, Pedersen said.
   The suspension on imports does not affect thousands of other
semiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits, he said. ``The ones
that don't look like automatic weapons are still coming in,'' he
said.
   The NRA maintains that only cosmetic differences exist between
the different weapons.
   Pedersen agreed with the NRA that it is extremely difficult to
convert such weapons into fully automatic guns, as members of
Congress and gun control advocates elsewhere have contended.
   According to estimates by the NRA and gun control activists,
there are 60 million to 70 million firearms in private hands in the
United States, including 20 million to 30 million semiautomatic
weapons ranging from pistols to the assault-style rifles.
   But it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles are
produced in the United States, as manufacturers are not required to
report their output with such detail, Pedersen said.
   In 1987, the United States produced a total of 1.76 million
handguns and 1.01 million rifles, including regular bolt and pump
action armaments as well as semiautomatics, Pedersen said. That was
a 300,000 jump in both categories _ handguns and rifles _ from the
previous year, and officials believe the number probably increased
in 1988.

   About 200,000 spectators
will converge on this Mojave Desert military base to watch Discovery
land early Saturday, NASA predicted.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokeswoman Nancy
Lovato said Wednesday that the crowd would be that big ``because
it's a weekend landing at the beginning of spring vacation.''
   The space shuttle and its five-man crew is scheduled to touch
down at 6:34 a.m., capping a five-day mission highlighted by
deployment of a $100 million communications satellite and
experiments aimed at developing new medicines and learning how bones
heal and chicken embryos develop in the weightlessness of space.
   Trouble with a valve on board Discovery had threatened to end the
mission a day early, but it was apparently fixed Wednesday and NASA
is aiming for a Saturday landing.
   NASA officials said Wednesday that because of a desire to perform
handling and braking tests, Discovery might land on concrete Runway
22 instead of on its normal landing strip, Runway 17, which is on
the unpaved, clay surface of Rogers Dry Lake.
   Runway 17 is roughly three miles from the public viewing site on
the lakebed's east shore. Runway 22 is about 4.5 miles, but ``it's
still a good view. You'll see `em fly right past,'' Lovato said.
   Meanwhile, five airmen playing the role of injured astronauts
were rescued Wednesday from a make-believe space shuttle fire in an
emergency drill by ground crews who will greet Discovery when it
returns Saturday. NASA routinely holds such simulations before real
shuttle landings.
   The east shore viewing site will be open to the public 24 hours
before the landing, and vehicle passes are not required. But gates
to the main parts of Edwards Air Force Base will be closed to anyone
not on official business.
   Access to the viewing site will be closed one hour before the
landing, Lovato said.
   Lovato said the two largest crowds for shuttle landings numbered
500,000, when Columbia landed here on July 4, 1982; and 410,000 on
Oct. 3 when Discovery glided to the desert floor to complete the
first shuttle flight since Challenger blew up after liftoff on Jan.
28, 1986.

   State and congressional housing experts say a
federal panel charged with coordinating programs for the homeless
has done little or nothing to address the problem.
   Witnesses at a congressional hearing Wednesday lambasted the
Interagency Council on the Homeless, saying it has not met its
legislative mandate.
   The criticism came at a joint hearing of two House panels as the
Senate subcommittee on housing introduced legislation touted by
sponsors as ``the framework for a new national housing strategy.''
   The litany of the council's failures began in the opening
statement from Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., who chairs the
Government Activities and Transportation subcommittee.
   Collins said the council ``has failed almost completely to carry
out the mandates set for it by Congress,'' she said.
   The council was established in 1987 by Title II of the McKinney
Act to coordinate 20 new programs created by the act. It is supposed
to provide information on the programs and help state and local
governments and non-profit organizations implement them.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the Employment and Housing
subcommittee, said much of the information that homeless providers
needed to apply for McKinney money was provided instead by the
National Governors Association.
   Wendy Adler of the NGA testified that after receiving numerous
questions from states, she developed a report on the status of
programs under the McKinney Act and related legislation. She said
the report has now been updated three times.
   ``This publication contains the type of information the council
should be disseminating,'' said Adler.
   Other witnesses said the council, in a year and a half since
enactment of McKinney, failed to hire a complete staff or identify
regional and field coordinators for programs. It focused too much on
the development of an electronic data base which housing providers
could not use, often sent information regarding application
deadlines late, met just five times and produced only three monthly
newsletters which contained useless information, the witnesses said.
   Cassandra Moore, the council's former executive director, blamed
a lack of resources. ``The duties with which the council is charged
and its ability to carry them out must be brought into balance,''
she said.
   Moore said Congress gave the council broad authority to develop
programs and issue timetables but not the power or resources to do
the job.
   She recommended increasing the staff size and removing the
council from the administrative wing of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, which she said has been unwilling to share
information.
   The council, composed of the heads or their designees of 10
Cabinet departments and five independent agencies, was headed under
the Reagan administration by then-housing secretary Samuel Pierce.
The Bush administration has yet to choose his successor.

   Federal officials prepared to vaccinate
5,000 people at an Indian reservation today as the nation's largest
current outbreak of meningitis claimed a fifth victim.
   A 17-year-old girl died early Wednesday, becoming the fifth
victim in south-central Washington this year. Seventeen people,
mostly children, have contracted meningitis or another form of
meningococcal disease since Jan. 10.
   ``It is very tragic and we are very concerned,'' said Linda
Topel, assistant director of the Yakima County Health District. ``We
are in an outbreak situation.''
   Although there are isolated cases of meningococcal disease around
the country all the time, the Yakima outbreak is the largest current
cluster, said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers of Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   The mortality rate of nearly 30 percent in the Yakima cases is
far higher than the national average of 10 percent among the 3,000
annual cases, she said.
   The six meningitis cases involve a bacteria that attacks the
lining around the spinal cord and brain, while the meningococcemia
cases involve a bacteria that attacks the blood stream, Ms. Schuchat
said.
   Doctors at the CDC plan to study the Yakima outbreak to see if a
particularly deadly strain of the meningococcal bacteria is involved.
   Anxious parents have deluged county and state health officers
with phone calls wondering if they should have their children
vaccinated, officials said.
   County health officials vaccinated 2,300 people in two
communities where schoolchildren were exposed to the bacteria by an
infected child, doctors said.
   In addition, the federal Indian Health Service planned to begin
vaccinating 5,000 residents of the Yakima Indian Reservation today
because Indians living in close quarters were considered at greater
risk of contracting the disease.
   No decision has been reached yet on whether to vaccinate more
than 60,000 people under age 25 in the entire county of 184,000
residents, Ms. Topel said.
   The vaccinations are given to people under age 25 because most
adults who become infected with the bacteria do not become sick.
   The latest victim had been hospitalized since Feb. 7, after
reporting a flu-like illness, he said. The others who have died were
three children under the age of 18 months and a 23-year-old man.
   No new cases have been confirmed since last weekend and officials
have no other suspected cases.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Up, Share Prices Off In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar finished higher Thursday against the
Japanese yen, while share prices erased earlier gains and lost
ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 130.73 yen, up 0.85 yen from Wednesday's
close of 129.88 yen. The currency opened at 130.68 yen and moved in
a range of 130.60-130.95 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
376.13 points the previous day, erased its gains earlier in the day
and lost 2.24 points, or 0.007 percent, to finish at 32,098.24.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise to a report
Wednesday by the U.S. Commerce Department that the nation's trade
deficit fell to $9.49 billion in January from a revised December
shortfall of $10.99 billion.
   After opening higher in Tokyo, following similar trends on
overseas markets overnight, the market's dollar-buying interest
remaind strong, said a dealer with a commercial bank in Tokyo,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Trading companies and foreign banks bought the currency, boosting
the dollar's rise, he said.
   The dollar is unlikely to continue to rise although a majority of
market players were in a dollar-buying mood, another dealer said

<HEAD>Study: Heart Failure Drug Not as Good as Old Standby</HEAD>

   A 200-year-old mainstay of treatment for congestive
heart failure will continue to play its key role after research
showed that a highly touted replacement is not as good for many
patients, experts say.
   When testing began several years ago with the new drug, called
milrinone, some experts predicted it would supplant digitalis as the
medicine of choice for the 4 million Americans with congestive heart
failure.
   The latest study, published today, compared milrinone to a form
of digitalis called digoxin in people with mild to moderate heart
failure.
   Although milrinone worked, it was not as effective as digoxin.
Those receiving it did worse and suffered more side effects.
   ``The clinical wisdom of a few years ago that it would be a
replacement for digitalis is not correct,'' said Dr. Robert
DiBianco, who directed the study. ``It will not replace digitalis.''
   Experts said the findings were surprising and disappointing. But
in an editorial published with the study in the New England Journal
of Medicine, Dr. Jay N. Cohn of the University of Minnesota said,
``The good news for now is that digoxin can be used with greater
confidence in its efficacy.''
   Doctors also said there should still be a place for milrinone
because it may be used in people who cannot tolerate digitalis.
   DiBianco said he would like to be able to prescribe milrinone for
such people, but ``for the majority of my patients, digitalis now
even more firmly becomes the standard drug.''
   DiBianco, a researcher at Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma
Park, Md., was the study's principal author. Research was conducted
on 230 patients at 32 hospitals.
   An injected form of milrinone, produced by Sterling Drug, was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year for
short-term treatment of acute heart failure. However, the FDA has
yet to clear the medicine's pill form, which was used in the latest
study.
   In the three-month comparison study, patients with mild to
moderate heart failure were randomly assigned to take milrinone,
diuretics, digoxin or a combination of these drugs.
   The conditions of 20 percent of those taking milrinone
deteriorated within two weeks after treatment began, compared with
only 3 percent of those receiving digoxin. Side effects of milrinone
included palpitations, irregular heartbeat, lightheadedness, low
blood pressure, nervousness and headaches.
   Among those who once suggested that milrinone might replace
digitalis was Dr. Donald S. Baim of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.
His early results showed that the drug helped people with severe
congestive heart failure who did not respond to other medicines.
   Although the latest results are disappointing, he said, ``I still
believe that there is a clear beneficial role in the patient who has
heart failure that is refractory to the conventional agents.''

   Images of violence, catchy music
and casual character assassination were among the dominant features
of an election campaign that tried to stick to the airwaves and stay
off of the streets.
   For one thing, radio and television advertisements were much
safer than public appearances in this country, where expressing your
political preference can be lethal.
   The campaign ended Wednesday with a burst of such advertistments
and a rally by the leftist Democratic Convergence. No campaigning is
permitted from today until Sunday's presidential balloting.
   The political parties knew that more than 85 percent of
Salvadorans homes have radios, the most pervasive medium in a
country where personal messages from one town to another are relayed
between songs on music stations.
   There are 51 AM stations in the country of 5.5 million people _ 3
million radio receivers and 4.5 million daily listeners.
   Now Salvadorans are being asked to go to the polls to pick a
president under the threat of violence by the leftist guerrillas of
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, whose nine-year war
against the U.S.-supported government has claimed 70,000 lives.
   The rebels, as in previous elections, have threatened violence
and urged voters to stay home on election day.
   In 1984, nearly 75 percent of the voters cast ballots. They chose
Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte as president and gave a
strong second place to a surging right-wing party _ the Republican
Nationalist Alliance _ that now threatens to wrest power from the
Christian Democrats.
   Political parties avoided big rallies both in the capital and in
the countryside during this year's four-month campaign. A Republican
Nationalist Alliance rally on Saturday was the largest of the
campaign, drawing more than 20,000 people in the capital.
   Most election work was carried out by party volunteers working
city blocks and at so-called ``carnivals,'' where party leaders
mingled with the people while local bands played and liquor flowed.
   Several people were killed in the early days of the campaign. The
leftist guerrillas threatened city mayors, then killed nine of them,
and leaders of the two dominant parties accused each other of
political slayings.
   As a result, all the parties took the lion's share of their
campaigns to the airwaves.
   Several sectors of society, principally the Roman Catholic
church, harshly criticized the mudslinging that marked the ads.
   The Christian Democrats ran a television ad that showed a
blood-covered man's body on the floor, followed by an image of a
similarily butchered woman.
   ``This is the kind of violence Arena brought to the country,''
says a guttural voice over a horror movie soundtrack, playing on
accusations that Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena, is
linked to right-wing death squads who killed thousands of reputed
leftists in the early 1980s.
   Arena ran radio ads alleging that Christian Democrat candidate
Fidel Chavez Mena embezzled or squandered millions of dollars, some
of it destined for victims of the 1986 earthquake.
   Both parties denied each other's accusations.
   The leftist Democratic Convergence ran television ads showing
soldiers firing on crowds while a voice sang, ``Let me not be
indifferent to pain.''
   The three parties flooded the airwaves on Wednesday, but the
well-funded rightist party had by far the most broadcast time.
   ``Of course, not only do we benefit from the propaganda, but we
block others,'' said an Arena campaign organizer, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   But the airwaves aren't reserved for the parties.
   The rebels spoke to voters with their clandestine Radio
Venceremos, taking credit for an attack on the presidential palace
and threatening election workers in an effort to enforce their
election boycott.

   Riot police stormed a subway depot and
arrested more than 2,300 workers who staged a wildcat strike today,
paralyzing Seoul's subway system and stranding thousands of
commuters.
   Most of the system's workers went on strike to demand dismissal
of the subway chief for bad faith in labor negotiations. The
government organized emergency transport with about 10,000 extra
buses and military vehicles.
   The 3 million people who use the subway daily in the city of
about 10 million people struggled to find alternate transport. Buses
were packed and taxis carried up to five passengers each.
   About 4,000 riot police stormed a subway depot to disperse 3,000
strikers who had seized the facility during the night and erected
barricades. Police armored trucks fired tear gas and bulldozers
knocked down the barricades.
   Some strikers, armed with steel pipes and clubs, hurled firebombs
at police before they were overpowered.
   Police officials said 2,344 strikers had been arrested at the
subway depot. Most would be released, but charges were being
prepared against about 30 union leaders for leading an illegal
strike, the officials said.
   Officials of the city-owned Seoul Subway Corp. said they were
maintaining limited service on some lines with managers,
non-striking workers and locomotive drivers from the national
railroad system, officials said.
   A sudden snow storm that hit Seoul during the morning added to
congestion and confusion in streets clogged with heavy traffic.
   Subway officials said about 6,000 of the system's 7,732 workers
were involved in the protest. It was the first strike in the
subway's 15-year history apart from a two-hour stoppage last June.
   Mayor Koh Kun apologized to commuters for the inconvenience. ``We
want the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands,''
he said.
   Subway President Kim Myong-nong ordered strikers to return to
work by early Friday or face disciplinary action. But union
officials, who declined to be named, said they had no intention of
returning until their demands were met and all arrested strikers
were released and charges dropped.
   The strikers had ignored a government order for a 15-day cooling
off period imposed late Wednesday after last-minute negotiations
failed on their demand that the subway corporation president be
dismissed.
   Union leaders said Kim had acted in bad faith during earlier
labor talks and demanded Koh sign a new agreement on pay and working
conditions because they did not trust the subway corporation.
   The mayor said he could not sign the agreement because he did not
represent the subway corporation.
   Strikers also demanded withdrawal of law suits against labor
leaders who organized protests last week. Subway workers allowed
commuters to ride free for four days last week.

   Brace yourself for a new invention: A
businessman has come up with flavored rubber bands that would
release fluoride into the mouth.
   Jeff Fasnacht and his company, Midwest Orthodontics, have secured
a $266,000 federal grant for research on the rubber bands for
braces, called elastomeric ligatures.
   Fasnacht said the product would have the same effect on teeth as
if the patient brushed three times a day.
   The company is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration before the product hits store shelves. Market
research predicts annual sales of between $12 million and $15
million, Fasnacht said.
   Jeremy Dunning, associate professor of research and director of
Indiana University's industrial liaison program, helped Fasnacht get
into a program for gaining Small Business Innovation Research grants.
   ``The bottom line is you must have a good idea to have a good
proposal,'' Dunning said of grant successes such as Midwest
Orthodontics.

   Three years ago, the Gwinnett County
police switched from their old brown-on-brown police cars, hoping
for a new image.
   The new cars _ white with a yellow lightning streak down the
sides _ made an impression, all right.
   ``Most of the officers just roll their eyes when the color of the
cars is brought up, or they get this look of disgust on their
face,'' Chief Charles Wayne Bolden said Tuesday.
   So after only a week on the job, Bolden has decided that the
yellow goes.
   ``Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist,'' he said. ``I don't
really see many police cars marked that way.
   ``Every time I see them, I feel like yelling out `Shazam!' like
in the Captain Marvel comic books.''
   A new decal will be phased in with new cars as budget allocations
allow, Bolden said.

   Hostages in Lebanon live in a world of hopelessness
and neglect, imprisoned as much by public indifference as by their
extremist captors, a former hostage says in an editorial published
today.
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a French journalist held by Shiite Moslem
kidnappers in Lebanon for three years, marked the anniversary of the
capture of fellow hostage Terry Anderson with a wrenching plea for
rekindled interest in the captives.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was captured four years ago today and has been held longer
than any of the other 14 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   In today's editions of the newspaper Le Monde, Kauffmann says the
hostages are no longer objects of mass compassion, no longer
bargaining chips, no longer even political symbols.
   ``The truth is that the hostages in Lebanon today have become the
damned of the West,'' he wrote. ``Without hope of being saved,
imprisoned in silence and darkness, deprived of the sight of the
world of the living, forgotten, they no longer represent anything.''
   Hostages such as Anderson are kept blindfolded and chained,
robbed of their humanity, he wrote.
   ``This absence of senses is the worst punishment that one can
inflict on a human being. The most tragic thing is that this torment
is administered as much from the outside by countries and people
indifferent to their fate as on the inside by their captors, who
also work to make them `insignificant' as men.''
   The captors ``condemned us to the chain, they made us blind
better to bend us and subjugate us. We had to become things. A
hostage is above all a package, which is logical because he is the
object of a swap.''
   He said Britain and the United States also consider the hostages
``as merchandise'' and ``in believing they are devaluing the
hostages by abandonment and silence ... have made them non-existent
... The Western hostages no longer exist for anybody except for
their families.''
   Perhaps the governments ``think the kidnappers will end up by
getting tired and letting them go,'' Kauffmann said. ``But this
calculation has proved false.''
   France won the release of its countrymen because it ``cared about
its hostages,'' he said. ``It was the spirit of solidarity of the
French people that provoked the political will of the government.''
   Nearly all Paris dailies today devoted stories to Anderson, who
also was the subject of numerous radio reports. Radio France network
carried reports on Anderson nearly every half hour during prime time
morning newscasts.
   Charles Glass, an American journalist who escaped after two
months of captivity in 1987, said in London:
   ``Now is the time for the kidnappers and those for whom they work
to release Terry Anderson and the other hostages in Lebanon and show
the world that they believe in the mercy of God.''
   Hesham el Essawy, chairman of the London-based Islamic Society
for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, said: ``We hope and pray
that this tragic situation will end soon. We are very confident that
this aspiration will be supported by every honest Moslem in the
world today.''
   Their statements were released through Article 19, an
anti-censorship organization.
   Also, the Australian Journalists' Association today called on the
Australian government to take whatever steps necessary to aid in the
release of the hostages. Association federal secretary Christopher
Warren said the group also has written Syria and Iran asking them to
intervene.
   Kauffmann was released May 4, 1988, with French diplomats Marcel
Fontaine and Marcel Carton. Islamic Jihad, the group that holds
Anderson, kidnapped Kauffmann on May 22, 1985.
   Kauffmann spent his last six months of captivity in the company
of American hostages, first Thomas Sutherland, then Frank Reed.
   Sutherland, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut, was abducted June 9, 1985. Reed 56, director
of the Lebanese International School, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986.

   The Romeo and Juliet romance of a
16-year-old Greek Cypriot schoolgirl and a 17-year-old Turkish
settler has stirred political passions on this divided east
Mediterranean island.
   The love story has underlined the deep-rooted divisions that
plague Cyprus 15 years after Turkey invaded and seized the northern
one-third of the island.
   And even though the young man was deported this week by Greek
Cypriot officials, the story in its small way symbolizes hopes of
reunification as leaders of the rival communities try to find ways
to bring them together.
   There was an uproar in the Greek Cypriot south in September when
the Turkish Moslem, Cengis Coksun Seytan, and Alexia Chronia, a
Christian, were married in a widely publicized Moslem ceremony in
the north.
   Alexia was only 15 at the time. She is only the second Greek
Cypriot girl known to have married a Turk since the 1974 invasion.
   Her family is part of a small, isolated Greek community in the
Karpas region of the north following the flight or expulsion of
200,000 Greek Cypriots after the invasion.
   Greek Cypriots were incensed not just that one of their own would
marry a Turk but one of the 50,000 mainland Turks shipped to the
north to increase the Turkish Cypriot population, which is
outnumbered 4-1 by Greek Cypriots.
   The Greek Cypriots demand the withdrawal of all the settlers and
some 30,000 Turkish troops from the north before a settlement can be
reached on reunification.
   Hardline Greek Cypriots alleged the girl had been kidnapped. Some
officers in the United Nations peacekeeping force believe the
hardliners sought to undermine the talks between their political
leaders.
   The Greek Cypriot press angrily demanded action by the U.N.
force, which supervises the living conditions of the Greek Cypriots
left in Karpas, to rescue Alexia. High school students staged
protest demonstrations demanding U.N. action.
   U.N. officers reported they found no evidence of coercion and
that Alexia was happy. Greek Cypriots called that a cover-up.
   Anger was fueled when Turkish Cypriot television, seen in the
south, broadcast the marriage of Cengis and Alexia and announced
that Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash had given the couple an
expensive wedding present.
   Greek Cypriot newspapers claimed the marriage was a Turkish
attempt to prove to the world that the mainland settlers were being
assimilated and were even acceptable to Greek Cypriots.
   In February, when Alexia crossed to the south she claimed she had
indeed been kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam before being
pushed into marrying Seytan.
   A few weeks later, Seytan slipped across the so-called Green Line
that divides the island to become a Christian so he and Alexia could
live in the more prosperous south.
   He was immediately arrested and held in jail on charges he had
kidnapped Alexia and entered the republic of Cyprus illegally.
   Alexia then changed her story, saying she had been forced by her
own family to concoct the kidnap story to save them from the
humiliation of her love for a Turk and conversion to Islam.
   ``I'd go to the end of the world to be with him,'' she said of
the curly haired Seytan.
   Seytan said during a brief court appearance: ``I love her. I want
to see her. Why won't they let me?''
   Nonetheless, the Greek Cypriot authorities ruled that he should
be deported as an illegal immigrant. They carried out the order
Tuesday. He was flown to Athens, Greece, and then to Istanbul,
Turkey. Alexia said she doesn't know what she will do, but had no
plans to go to Turkey.
   Some Greek Cypriots newspapers insist that Alexia's denial of
being kidnapped followed Turkish warnings they would harm her family
still in the north if she told the truth.
   But other newspapers have become sympathetic and urged tolerance.
   ``If these two youngsters are really in love, why don't we accept
the fact and let them live in peace,'' the independent Epikeri
weekly said in an editorial. ``Why do we object so violently and
fight this possibility?''

   Yasser Arafat says the next round of direct
talks between the PLO and the United States will be held next
Wednesday, and insists the uprising in the Israeli-occupied
territories will continue.
   Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
announced the date to reporters after meeting Wednesday with
Tunisian President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. The U.S. Embassy in
Tunis declined comment.
   The first formal meeting between a four-man Palestinian
delegation and U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr. was held Dec.
16. Pelletreau and Palestinian officials have since had several
informal meetings.
   ``In spite of the crimes, the blind and savage repression that
our people are suffering, the uprising will continue until the end
of the Israeli occupation of our Palestinian land,'' Arafat said.
   The uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip began on Dec. 8,
1987 and has claimed the lives of 396 Palestinians and 17 Israelis.
   Washington is trying to promote direct talks between the Israelis
and Palestinians. Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization
and refuses to talk to it.

<HEAD>Iran Rips Middle East Trip By Charles And Diana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran says the current
Middle East tour of Prince Charles and Princess Diana is a hostile
affront to Moslems who want Britain to ban Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Tehran Radio on Wednesday accused the British government of
trying to exploit the trip and ``give a cold shoulder'' to the
world's Moslems. But it warned that Britain could not avoid facing
``their wrath.''
   On the second day of their official visit to the United Arab
Emirates Wednesday, the heir to the British throne and his wife were
steeped in Arab traditions. There was camel racing, sword dancing
and open-air lamb roasting.
   The couple is on an official one-week tour of Kuwait, Bahrain and
the Emirates that was announced last June. Charles will then fly
alone to Saudi Arabia for a private visit.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in London, noted that the visit was
taking place while the 45-nation Organization of Islamic Conference
was meeting in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, with ``The Satanic
Verses'' at the top of the agenda.
   Iran on Wednesday told conference delegates it was honored to
have broken relations with Britain over the Rushdie affair. It
reiterated its call for the execution of Indian-born British author
first issued Feb. 14 by fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   ``Now under such circumstances when the British government has
applied all its resources for inflicting a blow upon Islam and
insulting our prophet, how can the presence of the British crown
prince in Islamic states be justified?'' said a commentary by Tehran
Radio.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
suggesting the Koran, Islam's holy book, was invented by the prophet
Mohammed rather than received directly from God, and for giving
prostitutes the names of Mohammed's wives.

   A convicted cop-killer granted clemency in
1985 may go free as early as Friday, said state parole officials who
voted to release him.
   A three-member panel of the state Board of Parole voted
unanimously Wednesday to release Gary McGivern, who some saw as an
unrepentant murderer.
   But McGivern also had some well-known supporters, including folk
singer Pete Seeger, conservative columnist William F. Buckley and
civil rights lawyer William Kunstler.
   ``It's been a long haul. I've been in this for 13{ years,'' said
Kunstler. ``I'm happy for Gary, his wife and his family.''
   Michael Kavanagh, the prosecutor who won the 25 years to life
sentences handed McGivern, 44, and co-defendant Charles Culhane,
said the parole board's decision was ``a sad commentary on our
criminal justive system.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo's grant of clemency for McGivern on New Year's
Eve 1985 was denounced by many New York law enforcement officials
and by then Vice President George Bush. At the time, Cuomo was
considered a potential 1988 presidential contender.
   Although Cuomo's clemency made McGivern immediately eligible for
parole consideration, the state board twice refused to free him
before Wednesday's hearing at Otisville state prison where McGivern
was being held.
   The board's executive director, Edward Elwin, said McGivern could
be freed as early as Friday.
   Through three trials, McGivern and Culhane steadfastly maintained
their innocence in the 1968 shooting death of William Fitzgerald, a
Westchester County deputy, during an escape attempt.
   Maurice Fitzgerald, the 86-year-old brother of the slain deputy,
said McGivern should have been kept in prison for life.
   ``But what are you going to do?'' he said after the parole board
decision. ``There's nothing I can do about it.''
   McGivern wasn't granting interviews Wednesday, but Culhane said
his friend's parole was ``wonderful.''
   Culhane said he felt the parole board's decision might help his
bid for early release. Thus far, Cuomo has refused to grant Culhane
clemency and he's not eligible for a parole hearing until late 1991.
That's when McGivern would have been first eligible for parole
without Cuomo's clemency.
   In the past, the board had cited the serious nature of the crime
in keeping McGivern behind bars. On Wednesday, the board noted
McGivern's ``outstanding record'' while in prison.
   Leading the effort to win McGivern's freedom has been free-lance
writer Marguerite Culp, a former newspaper reporter who met McGivern
while he was in prison and married him on the 10th anniversary of
the shooting.
   Elwin said McGivern and his wife planned to live at her home in
Woodstock.
   That's not far from where McGivern, Culhane and inmate Robert
Bowerman, according to prosecutor Kavanagh, tried to escape while
being transported from state prison to a court appearance. At the
time, McGivern and Culhane were serving state prison sentences for
the armed robbery of a gas station. Bowerman, a jailhouse lawyer,
was helping them appeal their convictions.
   Fitzgerald and Bowerman were fatally shot and McGivern and
Culhane were wounded. Kavanagh said it was McGivern who fired the
shot that killed Fitzgerald.
   Even though McGivern and Culhane have maintained Bowerman acted
alone, a second deputy in the car, Joseph Singer, said they were
involved. Singer has since committed suicide.

   A woman charged with breaking into the home
of talk show host David Letterman shrieked in court she has ``had
enough,'' and a judge ordered her to undergo further psychiatric
exams.
   Norwalk Superior Court Judge John J.P. Ryan on Wednesday ordered
a three-member panel to examine Margaret Ray to determine whether
the 36-year-old woman understands the charges against her.
   Ray's attorney, Anita Y. Cason, requested the additional tests
after a report by Dr. James Alexander found that Ray was competent
to stand trial. The psychiatrist examined the woman last week.
   Ray, who faces charges of criminal trespassing, burglary,
possession of marijuana and larceny, yelled out to reporters as she
entered the courthouse and spoke out in court, although warned not
to by the judge.
   Ray shrieked: ``I'm ready to talk. I've had enough. I've seen
enough.''
   Under Ryan's order, a panel made up of a psychiatrist, a
psychologist and a social worker from the state psychiatric hospital
in Newtown will examine Ray at the Niantic state prison for women.
   Ray has been held at the prison in lieu of $5,000 bail since her
arrest for breaking into Letterman's home in New Canaan on Feb. 28,
the second time in five days she was found inside Letterman's
unoccupied house. She was allegedly wearing one of Letterman's
watches and told authorities she was there cleaning.
   Ray also was arrested twice last spring for breaking into his
home in the exclusive community about 40 miles north of New York
City.
   Prosecutor Robert Hall told the judge Wednesday that ``Mr.
Letterman is most concerned'' about the break-ins.
   An attorney representing Letterman, host of NBC's ``Late Night
with David Letterman,'' attended the court proceeding, but didn't
speak.
   Ray is due back in court March 28, when the judge is expected to
determine whether she is competent to stand trial.

<HEAD>Train Engineer Told To Stop Readings, Greetings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the more than 400 commuters riding the
Rockport-to-Boston train, the days of poetry readings and words of
good cheer have ended.
   Alan McMillan, engineer of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Commuter Rail Train No. 110, has been told to stop talking to
passengers over the public address system.
   The 42-year-old McMillan, a railroad man since he was a teen-ager
and an engineer for 15 years, began his commentaries soon after
taking over No. 110 two years ago. He began by making occasional
observations about the weather and other things as the train passed
through marshlands leading into Boston.
   He expanded his repertoire last month after returning from a
vacation that included a train ride from Chicago to Seattle during
which he heard a club-car attendant recite poetry as part of his
announcement he was closing the bar.
   ``I thought, `Wow, what a great idea,''' McMillan said.
   And he began short readings, usually poetry and always something
he considered upbeat.
   He read while he drove the train through a work zone at 2 mph and
kept one hand on the brake.
   Passengers thanked him as they walked past his cab, and they
wrote letters commending him. One called him ``the goodwill
ambassador of the commuter rails.''
   But after pulling into North Station on Wednesday morning,
McMillan said an Amtrak supervisor told him unnamed higher-ups
wanted him to stop. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority
hires Amtrak to run its commuter trains.
   ``He told me the feeling is that somebody, someday, is going to
say something like, `How is he going to be able to drive the train
while doing that sort of thing?''' McMillan said.
   The Boston Globe said the Amtrak supervisor, Wayne Laxton,
declined to discuss the matter, but transit authority spokesman
Peter Dimond said his agency was concerned after the newspaper
inquired about McMillan's popularity.
   Dimond said officials thought what McMillan was doing was a
direct violation of regulations.
   ``Engineers are expected to give undivided attention to driving
the train and not doing anything but driving the train,'' he said.
   Earlier, McMillan said: ``I have not been seeking notoriety. I
began because I noticed that people getting off the train were never
smiling, that it always seemed to be `back to the salt mines' for
them ... I do this because of the positive effect that it has on
people.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Say Gunman Methodical During Shooting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Witnesses recounted brushes with death and
identified a 61-year-old retired librarian as the gunman who killed
six people and wounded 10 in a 1987 shooting rampage.
   During an emotional third day of testimony in Circuit Court
Wednesday, eight witnesses said William Bryan Cruse was purposeful,
precise and without emotion during the shootout at two Florida
supermarkets in Palm Bay on Florida's eastern coast.
   ``It wasn't a zombie-type look,'' said Robert Jones, who helped
usher people to safety during the April 23, 1987 attack and came
within about 15 feet of the gunman at one point. ``It (was) more or
less like somebody who had a job to do.''
   Cruse is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 28
counts of attempted murder and two counts of kidnapping.
   Lawyers for Cruse, who could face the death penalty, do not deny
he was responsible. But they say he was temporarily insane at the
time. The trial was moved inland to this central Florida town
because of heavy local news coverage.
   To deflate the insanity claims, prosecutors asked each witness in
detail how Cruse acted during the shooting, hoping to prove his
actions were deliberate.
   Publix store manager John Brubaker, employee Babetta Peterson and
shopper Douglas Pollock all said the gunman appeared to be in
control as he methodically took aim with his semiautomatic rifle at
human targets.
   Mrs. Peterson and her daughter arrived at the store as Cruse sped
into the parking lot and got out of his car with what appeared to be
a rifle, she testified.
   Then she saw the gunman shoot two young men who were coming out
of the store. As the men crumpled to the ground, the gunman
approached them and shot again, Mrs. Peterson said.
   ``He was holding it up like so and pointing it downward to where
they were, she said, crying on the witness stand as she described
how the gun was handled.
   Pollock said he saw two men lying motionless on the ground, and a
third man running away yelling in a foreign accent: ``Oh, God. Oh,
God.''
   The three men were Kuwaiti students. Two died, and the third was
seriously wounded.

<HEAD>18 Africans To Leave China, Saying It's Racist</HEAD>

   Eighteen students from Senegal say are leaving the
country because it is racist and life for them in China has become
intolerable.
   The departures over the next five days would mark the first time
African students have left China en masse since anti-black racial
incidents in four Chinese cities during December and January.
   Two Senegalese students, contacted this afternoon, said they were
happy to be leaving.
   ``This is my pass to freedom,'' said one man, holding his
airplane ticket. ``I've been here 3{ years but it's felt like a
decade.''
   The other student, Alpha Ndirye, said today that he and six other
Senegalese students will stay behind to finish the school year and
then follow their countrymen home.
   When they leave, Ndirye said, there will be no more students from
Senegal in China. He said the students were going home because
``China is racist.''
   ``Everywhere we go they still call us names and rub our skin to
see if we will become whiter,'' Ndirye said. ``The situation has
become intolerable.''
   Two Senegalese diplomats contacted today refused comment.
   The anti-black incidents began in the eastern city of Nanking
when Africans and Chinese fought on Christmas Eve after Africans
tried to bring Chinese girlfriends to a school dance.
   Chinese later stoned the Africans' dormitory and marched through
Nanking's streets, shouting ``Kill the black devils!'' and demanding
Africans involved in the fight be punished. One African was held by
police for 25 days and two others were detained two weeks.
   One of them, Alpha Robinson of Ghana, left China.
   Lesser confrontations involving alleged racism against African
students occurred in Beijing and two other cities. About 500
Africans students boycotted classes at the Beijing Languages
Institute. They returned to classes on Feb. 22 after the end of
winter vacation.
   Ndirye said the Senegalise students who are leaving have been
living in several cities, including Beijing and Nanking, and most
were on Chinese government scholarships.
   He and the other student said they planned to continue their
education in Western Europe, preferably France. Senegalese speak
French.
   Ndirye praised the government of Senegal for honoring their
requests to leave China.
   ``We are different than other African countries,'' he said. ``We
are more democratic. If we want to leave a place they respect us.''
   African students from countries such as Mali have complained that
their governments were not permitting them to leave China.
   In January, a report by the Nanking branch of the General Union
of African Students attacked African embassies for seeming to
``ignore us until things get blown up into crises.''
   Senegalese students today said they knew of several Ghanian
students who were trying to leave China. But a Ghanian diplomat said
his country had yet to decide what to do with the approximately two
dozen Ghanian students in China.
   And at least one student, Alex Dosoo, the one detained for 25
days in Nanking, said he will stay. In January, Dosoo told The
Associated Press he was determined to leave China.
   About 1,500 African students, most on Chinese scholarships,
currently study in China as part of Beijing's policy to cultivate
close ties with the Third World.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing, asked today about the
Senegalese, said he had heard nothing of their reported departure.
   He reiterated China's position that ``there is not such a
question as racial discrimination in China.''

   Work crews gathered to dismantle ``Tilted Arc''
just hours after the creator of the steel sculpture ended a
last-ditch effort to keep it at a federal office plaza.
   Richard Serra, who has maintained that merely moving the 73-ton
work from the site would destroy its artistic integrity, said
Wednesday that the removal is ``a very thoughtless and barbaric
act.''
   ``This country pays lip service to (Salman) Rushdie, and turns
around and destroys my piece,'' said Serra, referring to the British
author who had a price put on his head in Iran because of his book
``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslem leaders labeled
blasphemous.
   Hours earlier, Serra's lawyer, Jay Topkis, announced: ``We're
dropping all of our efforts to do anything about their destroying
Tilted Arc.''
   Serra has been battling in and out of court for the last four
years to prevent the government from removing the sculpture from
Federal Plaza in lower Manhattan where it was unveiled in 1981.
   Workmen were ready to dismantle and remove the 120-foot-long,
12-foot high, wall of curving, rusty steel over the weekend until
the government agreed to wait, pending further legal maneuvering by
Topkis.
   Topkis previously sought a delay, to which federal lawyers
consented, to research whether the work was protected under the
``moral rights'' clause of a 19th-century international copyright
treaty.
   But he said he concluded that the treaty from the Berne
Convention, which the United States joined two weeks ago, does not
bar the government ``from destroying this work of one of our
country's most distinguished artists.''
   Previously, Serra lost a $30 million damage suit against the U.S.
General Services Administration, which commissioned the work for
$175,000 in 1979.
   GSA decided to remove the work after numerous complaints that it
was an eyesore that bisected the plaza, preventing its use for large
public gatherings, said William J. Diamond, regional administrator
of the agency.
   ``This is an important victory for the people of lower Manhattan,
who will now be able to regain the use of the plaza, which has been
denied to them for seven years by `Tilted Arc,''' said Diamond.
   Diamond said the work would be stored under guard at a government
parking lot in Brooklyn. GSA plans an outdoor cafe, trees and other
greenery for Federal Plaza, he said.
   No permanent relocation site for the sculpture has been picked.

   Engineers today were troubleshooting
two rocket problems that forced postponement of the launch of a
satellite designed to test sensors for the ``Star Wars'' missile
defense system.
   The Air Force scrubbed the effort Wednesday night just 2 minutes
56 seconds before the planned liftoff because of a bad sensor
reading and a buildup of gaseous helium in a vibration-suppression
system on the Delta rocket.
   ``The launch team is currently evaluating the turnaround,'' said
Lt. Col. Ron Rand, an Air Force spokesman. ``We don't know whether
it will be 24 hours or longer.''
   The satellite sensors are designed to help develop the technology
for spotting and tracking hostile missiles launched at the United
States. It is a project for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
commonly known as Star Wars.

   Fawaz Younis, the Lebanese man convicted here
of hijacking a plane in Beirut in 1985, denounced terrorism in an
interview broadcast today and said the United States was ``showing
off'' by arresting him.
   ``I am sorry to say I have been imprisoned because the United
States government would like to show off,'' Younis, speaking through
an interpreter, said on the CBS ``Nightwatch'' program.
   Repeating his courtroom claim that he had been a member of the
Amal militia carrying out a military orders, Younis said he was not
an international terrorist as portrayed by U.S. authorities.
   ``If my brother would harm civilians, I would be against him,''
he said in the interview, which was taped Wednesday night.
   Younis was found guilty by a U.S. District Court jury of
hijacking a Royal Jordanian airliner from the Beirut airport in 1985
and holding 70 people, two of them Americans, for 30 hours. The jury
acquitted him of charges that he used or threatened violence against
crew members or passengers and that he helped blow up the aircraft.
   The hijacked plane was used to deliver to an Arab League meeting
in Tunisia Amal's demand that armed Palestinians be removed from
Lebanon.
   Younis, 30, was lured to arrest in an elaborate trap the FBI set
on a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea. U.S. officials call his
conviction a successful test of a 1984 statute giving the United
States jurisdiction over the taking of American hostages abroad.
   Younis remains imprisoned under heavy guard and faces a possible
sentence of life in prison. But he said he was tried unfairly for
taking orders as a member of the Amal militia seeking an end to
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   ``The leaders of Amal are not terrorists,'' he said. ``They will
not terrorize anyone, they will not harm innocent people.''
   ``We had an objective. Terrorist acts do not serve ... to end the
war. ... Terrorism harms civilians to serve objectives which have
nothing to do with the war.''
   Younis said he was the wrong target if the U.S. aim was to strike
against anti-American terrorism.
   ``But I would like to leave the judgment on this issue to the
American people,'' he said. ``Had I had any hate or problem with the
American government, I would have harmed those two American
citizens. The testimony proves in court they were well treated. They
were even better treated than the Lebanese citizens who were on
board that flight.''

<TEXT>
   Central American diplomats have reached
tentative agreement on a plan that would bring U.N. peacekeeping
troops into the region to monitor guerrilla movements.
   The foreign ministers of Nicaragua, Salvador, Honduras, Costa
Rica and Guatemala are to meet March 29-30 in San Jose, the Costa
Rican capital, to adopt the plan.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco of Nicaragua said
adoption would be ``a formality.'' Honduran Ambassador Roberto
Flores Bermudez and U.N. officials also confirmed Wednesday's
agreement in principle.
   Up to 11,000 Nicaraguan Contra rebels supported by the United
States have bases in Honduras from which they launch raids into
Nicaragua. They are the prime focus of the U.N. plan.
   A U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
peacekeeping plan does not conflict with President Bush's intention
to supply humanitarian aid to the Contras.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Tuesday that an
international border patrol force was ``not inconsistent'' with the
Bush administration's policy goals.
   The U.N. military observers are to operate in the region to
verify reports of guerrilla activity and, by their presence, deter
such raids.
   The United Nations has drafted a plan calling for up to 100
military observers backed by 60 pilots, drivers and civilian
administrators from Canada, Spain and West Germany.
   The peacekeepers are to focus on the Nicaragua-Honduras border to
check allegations of raids by the Contras, and the El
Salvador-Honduras border, according to the draft proposal.
   El Salvador says the leftist insurgents trying to overthrow El
Salvador's U.S.-supported government operate from secret bases in
Honduras without that government's permission, and that Nicaragua
supplies the rebels.
   The peacekeepers also are to monitor the Costa Rica-Nicaragua
border, and will use speedboats to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, which
links Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on their Pacific coasts.

   Churches won a court victory over the
government's electronic war against the Sanctuary movement, but four
Arizona churches must meet another test to keep their lawsuit alive,
a federal appeals court ruled.
   In a dispute that grew out of the federal government's use of
electronic surveillance to track the Sanctuary movement, the court
ruled unanimously Wednesday that churches have the right to sue over
the issue.
   ``Of course, we're delighted,'' said Susan Parrott, a member of
the Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, Ariz. ``We've always
felt that the infiltrators in our church were a disgrace.''
   But in order to keep their lawsuit alive, the churches must prove
that the surveillance is continuing or likely to resume, according
to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling. A federal judge in
Phoenix must weigh the evidence, the court said.
   Peter Baird, a lawyer for the churches, called the 3-0 ruling ``a
great stride forward toward protecting worship services from
electronic surveillance.''
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown declined to comment.
Patrick Kane, Phoenix district director of the federal Immigration
and Naturalization Service, said he had not seen the ruling and
could not comment.
   The court did not say whether government infiltration and secret
recording of church services, without a search warrant, would
violate freedom of religion or the constitutional ban on
unreasonable searches.
   That is a key issue in the pending appeal of eight Sanctuary
movement workers, including five members of the clergy, convicted in
Tucson in 1986 of a variety of immigration charges, including
illegally harboring and transporting Central American refugees.
   It was disclosed in that case that paid government informants had
secretly recorded worship services and Bible classes. A federal
prosecutor said the surveillance was proper because the church was
the site of a criminal conspiracy.
   The criminal appeal was argued before another panel of the 9th
Circuit last December and has not yet been decided.
   The civil suit that led to Wednesday's ruling was filed by
churches in Phoenix and Tucson. They said informants working for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service attended and secretly
recorded their services between March 1984 and January 1985.
   Once the surveillance was disclosed, church officials said, their
attendance declined, a Bible study group was canceled, and members
became more reluctant to seek pastoral counseling and less open in
their prayers and confessions.
   The suit sought a ruling that the surveillance was improper and a
court order banning it in the future.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Hardy dismissed the suit without a
trial, saying that even if all the allegations were true, the
churches as organizations had not been harmed. But the appeals court
disagreed.
   ``When congregants are chilled from participating in worship
activities, when they refuse to attend worship services because they
fear the government is spying on them and taping their every
utterance ... we think a church suffers organizational injury
because its ability to carry out its ministries has been impaired,''
said the opinion by Judge William Norris.

   A court today sentenced two businessmen
to 34 months in prison each after convicting them of treason for
selling U.S. computer technology to the Soviet Union.
   The court found Paavo Manner and Peter Perovuo guilty of
acquiring high technology intended for both civilian and military
use and exporting it to the Soviet Union in 1985 and 1987.
   The businessmen were also fined $65,000. A third defendant was
given a five-month suspended sentence as an accomplice.
   The trial was conducted behind closed doors in the Helsinki Court
of Appeals, which imposed a 25-year secrecy rule on the proceedings.
   The court said the leak of classified material to another state
could endanger Finland's relations to a foreign power.
   The two men were arrested one year ago.
   The equipment imported into Finland was subject to re-export
restrictions, set by the 16-nation Coordinating Commitee for
Multinational Export Controls, which are designed to prevent
militarily useful technology from reaching Soviet bloc countries.

<HEAD>Opposition Boycotts Parliament, Presents Memo To President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition lawmakers stormed out of
Parliament's upper house today after its chairman refused to ask the
government to release a report that allegedly links a top official
to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassination.
   All but one of the 93 opposition lawmakers in the 245-member
chamber decided to boycott the proceedings through Friday to protest
Parliament Chairman Shankar Dayal Sharma's decision.
   Some of the 63 opposition members suspended from lower house on
Wednesday for demanding disclosure of the report met with President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman and urged him to direct the government to
turn the report over to Parliament.
   The government has said the report will remain classified.
   The demand was first raised on Tuesday after the Indian Express,
the country's largest English-language newspaper, published excerpts
of the report.
   The Bombay-based newspaper quoted the inquiry as saying Rajendra
Kumar Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi's personal secretary, may have
``consciously or unconsciously ... facilitated the commission of a
crime.''
   Dhawan, 52, left the post after the assassination but returned
last month as a key aide to Rajiv Gandhi, the slain leader's son and
successor.
   Dhawan has refused comment on the allegations, but other
government officials have said he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
   The inquiry, ordered by the government and conducted by Supreme
Court Judge M.P. Thakkar, ran parallel to police investigations into
the assassination. It was submitted to the government in 1986.
   Opposition members in the upper house shouted slogans and pounded
on their desks today, demanding the government make the report
public.
   When Sharma refused to consider the issue, opposition legislators
walked out and said they would not return this week. They then
marched to the Presidential Palace and delivered copies of Tuesday's
Indian Express to the president and demanded he order the government
to release the report.
   The Indian Express, which has a nationwide circulation of 1.1
million, is frequently critical of Rajiv Gandhi.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct.
31, 1984, as she walked through the garden of her New Delhi
residence to a television interview.
   One of the guards was killed in a shootout with other guards. The
other was convicted of murder and hanged Jan. 5, along with a third
Sikh who was convicted of conspiracy.
   In its report, the Indian Express said the government report
accused Dhawan of altering the time of Mrs. Gandhi's appointment
with the television crew and that Dhawan, who was walking with Mrs.
Gandhi, fell back ``in the nick of time as they were approaching the
scene of the assassination.''
   The government has said Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an
army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine.

<HEAD>Dukakis Calls on Bush to Free Funds for Boston Harbor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is being asked to back up his
presidential campaign rhetoric blasting Gov. Michael S. Dukakis for
failing to clean up Boston Harbor.
   Dukakis, for whom the polluted harbor became a political
liability, asked the Bush administration Wednesday to put ``its
money where its mouth was.''
   ``When you make the kind of statements that were made in the
campaign, you've got an obligation to make good on them,'' Dukakis
said.
   The governor faulted Bush for proposing cutbacks in federal
wastewater construction programs that would cost Massachusetts $40
million. In addition, he charged that while Congress has earmarked
$59 million for the Boston Harbor project, the Bush administration
has not included those funds in its budget.
   Dukakis said he was confident the Massachusetts congressional
delegation would reverse those decisions.
   Bush, as the Republican candidate for president, staged a
surprise cruise in September on Boston Harbor to criticize Dukakis
for pollution.
   Dukakis supporters argued that the governor was primarily
responsible for the legislation designed to end the pollution by the
next century.
   But the charges, reinforced by a Republican campaign TV
commercial, stuck to Dukakis, leaving the Democrat on the defensive.
   ``I'm proud to say that as of today, we're right on schedule _
and that's the way we're going to keep it,'' Dukakis told reporters
Wednesday, flanked by Environmental Affairs Secretary John DeVillars
and Massachusetts Water Resources Authority Executive Director Paul
Levy.
   The governor ticked off a series of steps already taken to
address the harbor pollution, beginning with the creation of the
water resources authority.
   Noting that the agency has already spent $350 million of the
projected $6.5 billion cost, Dukakis said the state water authority
has stopped the discharge of ``floating scum'' from its aging
treatment plants at Nut Island and Deer Island.
   Dukakis promised that families will notice cleaner beaches this
summer in the metropolitan area.

<TEXT>
   Fresh from his ``kiss and make-up'' session with
``Today'' show weatherman Willard Scott, Bryant Gumbel has
apparently wiped another entry off his grudge slate _ David
Letterman.
   Gumbel called the host of ``Late Night with David Letterman''
recently to thank him for returning a copy of the now-famous memo
Gumbel had written criticizing some ``Today'' co-workers, including
Scott, the Daily News reported today.
   The newspaper said that whoever leaked the memo to the news media
apparently also sent a copy to Letterman, with whom Gumbel had been
feuding.
   That rift began when Letterman used a bullhorn to interrupt a
taping of the ``Today'' show in 1985 at the Rockefeller Center
skating rink. Letterman had shouted down from a building overlooking
the rink, ``I am Larry Grossman, president of NBC News ... and I'm
not wearing any pants!''
   Gumbel was reportedly furious, but according to Letterman's
executive producer, Jack Rollins, ``the two of them are back
talking.''
   Asked if Gumbel might agree to appear again on Letterman's show,
also on NBC, Rollins said, ``Anything can happen, but that's not up
to me.''
   On Monday, Scott kissed Gumbel on the cheek during the ``Today''
show as they buried their hatchet.

<HEAD>Pro-Free Market Premier, Government Sworn In In Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ante Markovic was installed today as
premier and promised a series of democratic-oriented economic and
political initiatives to roust this Communist country from a
nine-year economic slide.
   Markovic said in his inaugural speech that a free-market economy
is the ``ultimate achievement of mankind _ for which no alternative
has yet been found.'' A new Cabinet was also sworn in.
   ``There is no solution to the economic crisis without the
strengthening of political democracy in the country,'' he said,
urging the creation of ``a new modern socialist system.''
   The new premier said this Balkan country of 23 million people has
to undergo ``a fundamental change'' in order to revive the economy.
Yugoslavia is burdened by 346 percent annual inflation and a $21
billion foreign debt.
   Markovic indicated he would seek closer links the West, including
greater economic cooperation with the European Economic Community.
   He advocates reshaping the country's banking system along Western
lines, creating a stock market and ending state subsidies to
money-losing companies.
   Yugoslavia, which split from the Soviet bloc in 1948, is a
founding member of the non-aligned movement, and both superpowers
vie for its good graces.
   Markovic, a successful businessman, called for an immediate
introduction of shares and bonds, private initiative and
entrepreneurship and an end to state interference in the operation
of businesses.
   Markovic, a former president of the Croatian republic, succeeds
Branko Mikulic, who, together with his entire Cabinet, resigned Dec.
30.
   Mikulic's government was the first to resign since the Communist
Party took power after World War II. He stepped down following his
government's failure to solve the country's daunting social and
economic problems, including a dramatic rise in social and ethnic
unrest.
   Economic problems have been accompanied by a resurgence of
historic ethnic rivalries a this loose federation of six republics
and two autonomous provinces.
   Much of the recent unrest has centered on the southern province
of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of 90 percent.
   Markovic's 19-member Cabinet, the smallest in postwar history, is
a mix of prominent politicians and technocrats, with only two
ministers retaining the seats they occupied in Mikulic's government.
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar and Defense Minister Gen. Veljko
Kadijevic remained in the new administration, while Dobrosav
Culafic, Interior Minister in Mikulic's government, lost his job.
   Culafic was replaced following severe public criticism of his
handling of tensions in Kosovo, where emergency measures were
imposed last month in order to prevent clashes between ethnic
Albanians and Slavs living there.
   The important Interior Ministry went to Gen. Petar Gracanin,
president of the largest republic of Serbia, of which Kosovo is an
administrative part.
   Markovic named as vice premiers Aleksandar Mitrovic, Serbia's
vice president, and Zivko Pregl, executive secretary of the Slovene
Communist party.
   The choice of vice premiers indicates Markovic took a balanced
stand between Slovenia, which advocates a market economy and more
political pluralism, and Serbia, which strives for more centralism
and political orthodoxy.
   In his choice of Cabinet members, Markovic has for the first time
abandoned the principle of absolute parity among the republics and
autonomous provinces _ which, strictly adhered to in the past,
provided for equal Cabinet representation of all regions.
   Yugoslavia is run by a state presidency, a collective nine-man
body whose chairmanship rotates annually. It is the supreme
commander of the armed forces and executes foreign policy.
   The government is responsible for executing economic policy,
while the Communist Party Presidium, or Politburo, has 23 members to
oversee state activities.

<TEXT>
   The Republican Bush administration and the
Democratic-controlled Congress are vying furiously to gain credit
for helping American families afford satisfactory child care.
   The White House rushed a long-promised child-care bill to Capitol
Hill on Wednesday as the Senate Labor and Human Resources approved,
by an 11-5 margin, a rival $2.5 billion program of direct subsidies.
   Only those families making $13,000 or less would be eligible for
assistance under Bush's plan; the congressional proposal's income
ceiling would be each state's median income. The national median for
a family of four is $32,777.
   ``It's not a question of whether or not we're going to do
something on child care this year, but the direction it's going to
take,'' said Sen. Dan Coates, R-Ind., as the Senate panel worked
toward approval of the measure drafted by Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.,
and co-sponsored by about 40 Senate colleagues, including a handful
of Republicans.
   The Bush proposal, outlined by press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
would provide a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each child under age
4 in working families who make up to $13,000 a year. He said 2.5
million American families would initially benefit from the
legislation.
   Such families would be given credit toward the first 14 percent
of the income they report for tax liability purposes. This would
mean that people in the lowest, minimum-wage categories of less than
$8,000 a year would get less of a benefit than those at the upper
end of the scale.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., today called the
administration's approach a ``2 percent solution'' that should be
part of the more ambitious Democratic approach.
   ``I think we'll probably end up with both,'' she said on ABC's
``Good Morning America.'' ``One (the Republican bill) is a child
allowance bill, and that's fine. ... But it doesn't deal with child
care.''
   Fitzwater was questioned aggressively at the midday news briefing
about the Bush administration formula.
   ``You can always pick some number and say, `Is this enough, or is
this too little?''' he said.
   ``But the fact is, you need to start someplace. It reflects
budget considerations _ that we can't afford unlimited costs here
and obviously if you could pick any number you wanted to, and you
had unlimited billions to spend, you'd rather pick a much higher
figure, but you do the best you can with what you've got.''
   During his presidential campaign, Bush repeatedly cited
child-care assistance for American families as one of his top
priorities.
   Under existing law, parents are allowed a $720 credit for child
care costs incurred in order to accept or keep employment, but it
applies only to families with sufficient income to pay federal
income taxes.
   Under Bush's plan, if a family's income tax liability was less
than $1,000, it would get a refund reflecting the difference between
the amount owed and the $1,000 credit.
   The Dodd bill, similar to a measure that reached the Senate floor
last year but was blocked by an informal filibuster, would provide
benefits to families with children up to age 15 whose income does
not exceed the median income in the state where they live.
   Aside from the scope and cost of the programs, a major difference
is that the Dodd bill would set up minimum federal standards for day
care providers _ although states would be given more than six years
to comply _ while the Bush measure would leave standards solely to
the states, as they are now.
   Bush said emphatically in a statement that he opposed having the
federal government get into the business of regulating the quality
of child care.
   ``Federal policy should increase, not decrease, the range of
choices available to parents,'' he said. ``The federal government
should not become involved in licensing decisions and federal
financial support should not be made contingent upon state licensing
decisions.''
   At a news conference, Dodd welcomed Bush's determination to push
for child care assistance but ridiculed some aspects of the
president's proposal as ``utterly amazing.''
   ``I'm opposed to any suggestion this is a substitute somehow for
a meaningful child care bill,'' Dodd said. He said the
administration's bill would cover less than 2 percent of the
population.
   While Fitzwater gave no estimate of what the Bush proposed tax
credits might cost the Treasury, Dodd and others have said it would
be minimal _ probably just a few million dollars.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that Democrats had their own bill and said
that was ``one of the reasons why we wanted to get on ... as soon as
possible'' with the administration version.
   ``It's a matter where there is a direct philosophical difference
between Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, and
one that will be argued probably along those lines in some cases,''
Fitzwater said. ``But it's also a debate I think everybody wants to
have because both sides of the Congress recognize there is a need
and a desire to do something.''

<HEAD>Caller Claims Responsibility For Van Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI says it is checking into claims by a
radio station caller that a group called Guardians of the Islamic
Revolution planted the bomb that destroyed a van driven by the wife
of the USS Vincennes skipper.
   Meanwhile, trustees at the private school where the skipper's
wife teaches scheduled an emergency meeting today in response to
parents' concern about student safety if Sharon Rogers returns to
her fourth-grade classroom.
   The caller, who spoke with a Middle Eastern accent and claimed to
be a member of the group, linked Friday's car bombing to last July's
downing of an Iranian jetliner by a missile fired from the
Vincennes, the radio station said.
   All 290 people aboard of the jet were killed when Capt. Will C.
Rogers III gave the order to fire in the belief the aircraft was an
attacking warplane.
   The caller to Los Angeles radio station KNX on Wednesday also
threatened additional attacks against Rogers' wife and ``all the
American officers and officials,'' said Roger Nadel, the station's
executive news producer.
   ``We're looking into (the claim),'' said Fred Reagan, an FBI
spokesman in Los Angeles. He declined to elaborate.
   Terrorist expert David Hoffman of the Rand Corp. said he doubts
the validity of the call because it came five days after the bombing
and wasn't phoned to a news wire service like most legitimate claims
for such acts.
   Guardians of the Islamic Revolution has told international news
organizations it was responsible for the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
   The Islamic group also has claimed credit for a July 1987 car
bombing in England that killed a former minister in the government
of Iran's deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, and the October 1987
slayings of two opponents of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.
   Mrs. Rogers escaped uninjured in Friday's bombing of the family
van. The FBI said the bomb was a non-military device, possibly a
pipe bomb.
   FBI spokesman Ron Orrantia has said no possible motives for the
attack on the van have been ruled out, including retribution for the
airliner downing.
   Mrs. Rogers' future at La Jolla Country Day School may be
discussed at today's board of trustees meeting, which was called
after the school received a bomb threat Tuesday, board member
Houshmand Aftahi said.
   Police found no explosives, but the incident apparently caused
concern among parents that such threats will continue if Mrs. Rogers
returns to the school, where students will be off the next two weeks
for spring break.
   ``I hear that some parents are concerned and they want to know
what the school is going to do about it,'' Aftahi said.
   ``We're all concerned about the security of our children, and we
feel that her presence on the campus, at this point, is not good,''
an unidentified parent told the Los Angeles Times. ``I think parents
would prefer that she stay away for the rest of the school year.''

   South Africa said today that
U.N. fundraising efforts to benefit the SWAPO guerrilla movement
have raised doubts about the U.N.'s impartiality in monitoring the
Namibian independence process.
   The United Nations has been soliciting funds for the
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, set
for March 21, said Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general
of foreign affairs.
   He said some of the money raised will go into four funds that are
spent for the benefit of the South-West African People's
Organization. The U.N. spent about $30 million on SWAPO from these
funds last year, van Heerden said.
   SWAPO has waged a guerrilla war since 1966 in a bid to win
independence for the territory, which has been ruled by South Africa
since World War I.
   Last year, South Africa agreed to a U.N. plan that calls for the
independence process to begin April 1, leading to elections in
November. SWAPO is favored in the elections, but other political
parties will be competing.
   Van Heerden said there would be ``hell to pay'' when these
parties learn that the U.N. was raising money that would benefit
SWAPO.
   Van Heerden also accused SWAPO of inflating the number of its
supporters living as refugees outside Namibia. SWAPO has said there
are 80,000 refugees, while the U.N. has put the figure at around
60,000, and South Africa has suggested there might be as few as
15,000. SWAPO receives funds from various countries and
organizations on a per capita basis.
   The U.N. operation in Namibia involves 4,650 peacekeeping troops
and will cost in excess of $400 million.
   One of the major Namibian political parties today accused
Australian peacekeepers of attending a party of SWAPO supporters and
wishing the organization well in the elections.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance said about five Australian
peacekeepers went to the party Tuesday evening in the northern town
of Grootfontein. At one stage, one of the Australians went to the
microphone and wished SWAPO success in the elections, the alliance
said in a statement.
   The alliance, a multiracial coalition, is expected to be SWAPO's
main competitor in the elections.
   About 170 peacekeepers from Canada, Denmark and Ireland arrived
in Namibia today to join the U.N. forces. More than 20 nations are
sending troops and administrative personnel to participate in the
U.N. effort.

   A man robbed a bank in Chattanooga and
took a $210 getaway cab ride to Nashville _ paid for with the loot _
before being arrested in a motel room, police said.
   The unidentified cabbie told police Wednesday he had no idea his
passenger, Paul Fabio Martin, had allegedly robbed a bank and said
Martin even bought him a hamburger on the 2{-hour drive, according
to police.
   Martin, 31, of Cleveland, was being held today in Nashville on
charges of armed robbery, said FBI spokesman Verne Gauby.
   The robber entered a bank Wednesday morning, fired a shot into
the air, took an undisclosed amount of cash and drove off, Gauby
said. Soon after, Chattanooga police found his car nearby and
learned he had hailed a cab.
   The cab driver was found in nearby LaVergne and said he had
dropped off the man at a Nashville motel, said Nashville police Sgt.
Dennis Birdwell.

   A federal judge impeached by the House fought
to hang onto his job in a dramatic personal appeal on the Senate
floor and then sat in silence as lawmakers denounced him for
``inexcusable breaches of the public trust.''
   Standing before the Senate, District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami declared Wednesday he had been acquitted by a jury in 1983 of
charges of plotting to get a $150,000 bribe and said ``five years of
post-acquittal investigation has produced no new evidence.''
   ``I proclaimed my innocence then as I have from the outset and as
I do now,'' said Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida
history.
   Nearby sat Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who resigned
as a federal judge to come to the Senate, his expression alert but
noncommittal. A few desks away, Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., former
chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, thumbed through law
books and leaned forward from time to time to gaze at Hastings.
   The Senate planned a closed-door session today to consider the
appeal from Hastings and his attorney, Terence J. Anderson, for
dismissal of all but one of the 17 articles of impeachment approved
by the House 413-3 on Aug. 3.
   In an impeachment trial, House members serve as the prosecutors
and the Senate acts as the judge and jury.
   A decision to go ahead with the impeachment trial would move the
proceedings to a special committee for hearing evidence, followed by
a floor vote on whether to convict Hastings of conspiracy, perjury
and disclosing secret wiretap information in an investigation of
South Florida corruption.
   Hastings, 52, would remain free if convicted but would lose his
seat on the federal bench and his $89,500 annual salary.
   Packed galleries were ordered by Sergeant-at-Arms Henry K. Giugni
to ``keep silent on pain of imprisonment'' as Hastings took the
floor to address an extraordinary Senate session with attendance
among lawmakers unusually high.
   ``The jury heard all the evidence and argument on both sides,''
Hastings said. ``They were attentive. The prosecutors never
complained about either the quality of the jurors or the attention
they gave. Those jurors deliberated carefully. They reached a
conclusion. All 12 of them agreed that I was not guilty.''
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, one of the prosecutors, scoffed at
Hastings' position. He said a double-jeopardy defense did not apply
in an impeachment trial but that the judge was seizing on it anyway
``to shield himself from the consequences of his inexcusable
breaches of the public trust.''
   ``Over five years, Judge Alcee Hastings engaged in a clearly
discernible pattern of misbehavior,'' Bryant said.
   ``He conspired to sell his public office for personal gain, he
subverted our judicial process by repeatedly lying under oath and he
divulged confidential information in violation of his own court
order,'' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
told the Senate while Hastings sat silently at the defense table
with his attorneys.
   ``Today, Judge Hastings asks you to ignore his corrupt conduct,''
Brooks said. ``In doing so, he asks you to rely on a tainted jury
verdict.''
   In addition to asserting the double jeopardy defense, Hastings
says he cannot get a fair trial because of numerous delays between
the 1983 criminal trial and now. House members say the judge himself
caused 18 months of delays by fighting a rearguard action to prevent
lawmakers from getting their hands on evidence.
   Hastings, a 1979 appointee to the federal bench, was arrested the
night of Oct. 8, 1981, in Miami, hours after a close friend,
Washington attorney William Borders, was caught with a garment bag
containing $125,000 in cash that he had received from an undercover
FBI agent.
   The undercover agent had been posing as Frank Romano, one of two
brothers already under a three-year sentence from Hastings after
being convicted of skimming from a Teamsters pension fund loan.
   The Romano brothers, who have since died, had balked when
approached about paying a bribe in exchange for a better sentence.
The FBI, which had been investigating Borders, set up a sting
operation with the undercover man masquerading as Romano.
   Borders, at the time a politically influential Washington
criminal lawyer, was convicted of promising that Hastings would
change the prison time to probation in exchange for the $150,000
payoff. He was sentenced to five years and went to prison after his
appeals failed.
   Hastings was in Washington for a testimonial dinner for Borders
the day the FBI sprang its trap. Informed that agents wanted to
question him, he left his suite in the plush L'Enfant Plaza Hotel
without packing or checking out and told a friend he was taking a
cab to National Airport, four miles away.
   Instead, he traveled more than 30 miles to Baltimore-Washington
International Airport and caught a flight to Miami but deplaned in
Fort Lauderdale and rented a car to drive to Miami. His own auto at
the time was parked at the Miami airport.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Say They Shot Down Two Planes, Captured Two Helicopters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas today claimed they
shot down two more aircraft in heavy fighting in eastern Afghanistan
and captured two helicopters from Afghan soldiers who deserted.
   The claim brought to seven the number of communist aircraft the
insurgents say they have destroyed this week in fierce fighting for
the strategic city of Jalalabad, 40 miles west of the Pakistan
border.
   There was no immediate comment from Afghan government, and it was
not possible to confirm the claims.
   Reports from the Afghan capital indicate Moscow has resumed an
airlift of military supplies to Kabul in response to the 10-day
Jalalabad offensive, which has had some of the heaviest fighting of
Afghanistan's civil war.
   The lastest reports indicate that Afghan soldiers withstood the
guerrilla offensive on Jalalabad and that the fighting has reached a
stalemate.
   No reliable casualty figures are available but estimates run in
hundreds of dead and thousands of wounded on both sides.
   It is the first major showdown between government troops and the
guerrillas since Soviet forces ended nine years of military
involvement in Afghanistan on Feb. 15. The guerrillas have fought
the government since 1978 to establish an Islamic republic in
Afghanistan.
   Observers believe a guerrilla victory at Jalalabad, a key city
along the main highway from Pakistan to Kabul, could lead to the
fall of the capital, 75 miles to the west.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said insurgents downed a
helicopter gunship near Jalalabad's television station and an
airplane outside the city on Wednesday.
   A spokesman for the guerrilla National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan, who demanded anonymity, reported crews of two
helicopter gunships surrendered their craft to guerrillas outside
the western city of Herat, near Iran.
   The guerrillas claim they overran Jalalabad's most important
garrison, Samarkhel to the east of the city, and were closing in on
the airport.
   But Afghan soldiers have retaliated with unexpectedly aggressive
aerial and artillery bombardments which reportedly have stalled the
rebels' progress.
   
   Fighting now centers on suburbs north, west and south of the
city, according to reports reaching Pakistan today.
   ``The regime militas have been offering stiff resistance to
(guerrilla) advances,'' said Ijaz Gilani, a Pakistani who monitors
the war for the semi-private Institute for Strategic Studies in
Islamabad.
   Leaders of the Pakistani- and U.S.-supported guerrillas have
predicted an early collapse of the Kabul government in the absence
of its Soviet backers, but Afghan President Najib has insisted his
forces are strong enough to survive.
   Radio Kabul said Wednesday that over the previous 24 hours, 560
guerrillas and supporters were killed and 252 were wounded. It said
the dead included four Americans, a Saudi national, and some
Pakistanis.
   Pakistan, the United States and Saudi Arabia back the Moslem
guerrillas in their war with the communist government but deny
having any nationals fighting in Afghanistan.
   Despite communist claims, guerrilla sources say they have lost
only about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700
government troops.

   Discovery's astronauts, working again
at full electrical power, received a call from President Bush and
focused cameras on the wounds inflicted on Earth by man's pollution
and nature's violence.
   Flying upside down 180 miles high, the five-man crew captured
thousands of views of Earth with television, movie and still
cameras. Some of the film will be edited into a study of ecological
trouble spots.
   The president and the crew talked briefly in a combined
television-telephone hookup that let Bush see the astronauts in
their space cabin from the White House.
   Bush congratulated them on their flight _ which nearly had to be
cut short one day because of an electrical-system problem _ and
said, ``I am determined to go forward with an active space program.''
   When Discovery commander Michael L. Coats revealed that the crew
was ``flying something for the new first lady'' it prompted a
presidential invitation.
   ``You better come up here and give it to her personally,'' said
Bush. ``You're invited. When you get back head this way.''
   Asked about a camera used to photograph environmental targets,
pilot John E. Blaha said the crew was ``getting a lot of great film
that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the
planet Earth is in this big vastness of space.''
   ``There is so much interest today on the global environment,''
replied Bush. ``I think a lot of people will see from just your
important mission the contribution that space exploration can make
to the world's environment.''
   Discovery's crew started the day by pre-empting the usual wake-up
call from Mission Control with tape recordings of their own. They
ended their eight-hour sleep by radioing to Earth the theme music
from ``Star Trek.''
   Then, the recorded voice of William Shatner, who played Capt.
Kirk in ``Star Trek,'' sent congratulations to Mission Control.
   ``Discovery,'' responded a Mission Control communicator, ``tell
Scotty to beam me up.''
   A rousing medley of school songs from the alma maters of the crew
members was the official wake up sound from Mission Control.
   The tape included ``Anchor's Aweigh'' for Naval Academy graduates
Michael L. Coats, James A. Buchli and Robert C. Springer; ``Wild
Blue Yonder'' for Air Force Academy graduate John E. Blaha, and the
Drexel University fight song for Dr. James P. Bagian, a physican who
earned a bachelor's degree from the Philadelphia school.
   Their fourth day in orbit was the first with a trouble-free
electrical power supply system. On Wednesday, they followed special
operating instructions from Mission Control to correct an erratic
flow from a hydrogen tank that supplies reactant to chemical power
generators on the shuttle.
   Flow from the tank became troublesome shortly after Discovery was
launched Monday and Mission Control feared that fuel from the tank
would not be available for use. Engineers asked the astronauts to
dim lights and turn off computers, and said the five-day mission
could be cut short a day if the problem wasn't corrected.
   The fuel cells on the shuttle combine hydrogen and oxygen to make
electricity and pure water.
   Discovery became an orbiting movie studio for part of today. The
astronauts were using a 70mm camera to take high fidelity pictures
of environmental targets on Earth for a joint project of the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Photo targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution
off east Africa, the scars left by fires in Florida's Everglades and
the forests of the western United States, areas of deforestation in
South Americas and an active volcano in Guatamala.
   ``We got plenty of shots of Florida,'' Bagian reported. ``And we
got some very good pictures of Hawaii.''
   The astronauts also aimed cameras at Indonesian volcanos, the
Great Barrier Reef off Australia, the Andes Mountains in South
America, the Aswan Dam in Egypt and the Baja California portion of
Mexico.
   Mission Control remotely operated television cameras on Discovery
to capture startling views of lightning playing across the skies
over South America and Australia.
   From the Discovery's camera perch, the lightning could be seen
bursting like a string of flashing white lights on a Christmas tree.
Earlier studies from space have shown that lightning bolts seem to
trigger each other in sequence along the front of a moving
thunderstorm.
   The astronauts also tended to their strange collection of
orbiting companions _ four crippled rats, 32 fertilized chicken eggs
and a miniature plot of plants _ that are among the experiments
aboard.
   Four caged rats with intentionally injured bones are being flown
to test how weightlessness can affect healing.
   The chicken eggs will be examined after Discovery lands to
determine how weightlessness affect the embryo development and a
similar study is being made on the roots of a group of plants
growing in a box on board.
   The flight is the first of the year and NASA hopes to have six
more as the agency builds toward a planned one-a-month flight rate
within two years. The mission is third since U.S. flights resumed
following the 1986 accident that destroyed space shuttle Challenger
and killed seven astronauts.
   The astronauts accomplished the main goal on its first day of the
flight _ deploying a $100 million communications satellite. The
satellite is in a high orbit where it completes a network NASA will
use to link communications with shuttles and other satellites.
   The mission is scheduled to end Saturday at Edwards Air Force
Base in California.

<HEAD>University Trustees Said Concerned About Administrators' Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees of Howard University have expressed
concern that the institution's administration may be incapable of
resolving pressing problems and agreed to closely monitor top
administrators, it was reported today.
   Board members also told administrators Wednesday they hold them
responsible for student demonstrations at the predominantly black
university that subsided only after the intervention of Mayor Marion
Barry Jr. and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, The Washington Post
said.
   John E. Jacob, chairman of the board of trustees, told reporters
that in a board meeting with President James Cheek and others, ``We
expressed our expectation that the administration will manage this
institution as efficiently and effectively as possible and correct
the inadequacies that exist. The board wants to make sure we don't
get a recurrence (of the demonstrations) in the future.''
   The Poat quoted one unidentified trustee as saying: ``There is a
deep concern on the part of the trustees that our recent troubles
are a result of the fact that there is no one at the helm. We will
be meeting over the next two to three months to determine if there
is any way to address Howard's problems with the present
(leadership) team.''
   Roger D. Estep, vice president for university relations who has
been acting as spokesman for the administration, said he could not
comment on the criticisms raised about Cheek or his deputies.
   For more than three days last week, 3,000 students, about
one-fourth of the student body, occupied the Howard administration
building to protest the appointment of Republican National Chairman
Lee Atwater to the board of trustees.
   Atwater's nomination, while made by another trustee, was
wholeheartedly supported by Cheek, who has been president of the
federally subsidized university since 1968.
   Students said Atwater's management of President Bush's election
campaign had had racist overtones, and that his appointment showed
how insensitive university administrators are to their concerns.
They demanded and received Atwater's resignation.
   They also got assurances that the school would consider an
African-American graduate studies program, and work on severe
housing inadequacies, speedier processing of financial aid and
security improvements.

<TEXT>
   Christians and Moslems battled with
artillery across Beirut today, and Moslems staged a nationwide
strike to mourn victims of the worst round of civil war fighting in
four years.
   Police said Moslem gunners fired rockets from west Beirut's
seaside Zeitouni district into the Christian-controlled Beirut port,
damaging installations but causing no casualties.
   In retaliation, Christian batteries fired on the Moslem
residential districts of Sabra and Kasskass near Beirut's dividing
Green Line, a police spokesman said. There were no immediate reports
of casualties, according to the police spokesman, who requested
anonymity.
   Loudspeaker vans toured west Beirut after the bombardment, urging
people to remain indoors.
   Sniper fire crackled in the old commercial district straddling
the Mediterranean harbor and around the Christian-held town of Souk
El-Gharb, southeast of the capital, police said.
   The two locations were the main battlefronts in the past eight
days of fighting that left 49 people dead and 161 wounded, by police
count.
   The clashes occurred between Christian units of army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian-backed militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.
   The fighting began after Aoun on March 6 imposed an air-and-sea
blockade on illegal harbors run by Moslem militias south of Beirut
in a bid to choke off their main source of revenue.
   The blockade angered Jumblatt, whose party runs two illegal port
facilities south of Beirut, and Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri,
whose Amal militia operates one port in south beirut.
   The militias use the ports to bring in weapons and supplies as
well as imported goods sold in areas under their control. As a
result, the state treasury loses an estimated $100 million a year in
customs duties.
   The one-day strike in west Beirut and other Moslem areas was
called by Jumblatt and his Moslem and leftist allies ``in mourning
for the victims of the massacre committed by Gen. Aoun.''
   Most casualties in the latest round of the 14-year-old civil war
were victims of a 24-hour shelling duel in Beirut on Monday and
Tuesday.
   Schools, shops, cafes, restaurants, banks and other businesses
were closed in west Beirut in response to Jumblatt's call for a work
stoppage.
   The police spokesman said Moslems in cities in north, east and
south Lebanon also joined the strike.
   Aoun heads a Christian military Cabinet that has been vying for
legitimacy with a rival Moslem Cabinet under acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss since President Amin Gemayel's term ended Sept. 22.
   Minutes before stepping down, Gemayel named Aoun to head an
interim military Cabinet, but his appointment was rejected by
leftists and Moslems who declared allegiance to Hoss.
   Aoun, 53, accused Syrian peacekeeping troops stationed in west
Beirut of causing the two-day bombardment.
   He declared that his 20,000 regular troops were involved in a
``war of liberation'' against Syrian occupation forces.
   The Syrians, with 40,000 troops deployed in predominantly Moslem
sectors of the country, are Lebanon's main power brokers and support
Hoss' cabinet.
   In Syria, the Al-Baath daily newspaper, which is controlled by
President Hafez Assad's ruling party, denied Aoun's charges and said
they were aimed at ``devastating Syria's constructive role in
Lebanon.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is
being criticized for sending a letter used by conservative Arizona
Republicans to support their claim that the United States is ``a
Christian nation.''
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way, said
the letter has lent support to a movement that is ``a force for
religious intolerance.'' The liberal activist group supports strict
separation of church and state.
   O'Connnor said in a brief statement Wednesday that she was sorry
the way her letter was used.
   ``I regret that a letter I sent to an acquaintance in response to
her request for information was used in a political debate,'' said
O'Connor, a former state legislator from Arizona.
   ``It was not my intention to express a personal view about the
subject of the inquiry, but merely to attempt to respond
appropriately to one of the many requests for information which come
across my desk.''
   She declined further comment.
   O'Connor's May 19, 1988 letter was sent to Annetta Conant, author
of a resolution characterizing the United States as a Christian
nation that was adopted last January by the Arizona Republican Party.
   The resolution is a rallying point for backers of the state's
former GOP governor, Evan Mecham, who was removed from office last
year. Moderate Republicans and prominent Jewish Republicans in the
state expressed dismay over the resolution.
   O'Connor said in her letter to Ms. Conant, ``You wrote me
recently to inquire about any holdings of this court to the effect
that this is a Christian nation. There are statements to such effect
in the following opinions.''
   The letter cited three high court rulings. In one, handed down in
1892, the court said, ``We are a Christian people and the morality
of the country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity.''
   But two more recent opinions do not refer to the United States a
a Christian nation in the pages cited by O'Connor.
   One opinion, written by liberal Justice William O. Douglas in
1952, said, ``We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the freedom to worship as
one chooses.''
   The other, a concurring opinion by Justice Felix Franfurter in
1961, said religious beliefs in America ``shall continue ... to
exist, to function ... free of the dictates and directions of the
state.''

   R. Gene Simmons is back on death row
after a fellow inmate persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court against
Simmons' wishes to block his execution this morning for the slayings
of 14 family members.
   Simmons, 48, had been scheduled to die by injection five weeks
after he was convicted of the 1987 Christmastime killings. He has
said he wants to die and refused to appeal.
   The order to stop the execution was issued Wednesday without
dissent or comment.
   ``We're disappointed because we know our client will be
disappointed,'' said Simmons' attorney John Harris, who had met with
his client Wednesday afternoon. ``I personally felt that would be
the last time I talked to him.''
   Simmons, who was eating his last meal when he saw a TV report
about the stay, merely asked if he could finish the meal.
   Jonas Whitmore, who is appealing his 1987 death penalty and
conviction, had filed the petition, contending that Simmons'
execution _ which would have been the first in Arkansas in a
quarter-century _ could have repercussions for other death row
inmates.
   Arthur Allen, Whitmore's attorney, said the U.S. Constitution
requires an appeal in all death cases.
   The state Supreme Court ruled Friday that Simmons is competent to
waive his appeal for the February conviction. The same court on
Monday rejected Whitmore's petition, claiming he lacked legal
standing. Whitmore filed the petition with Justice Harry Blackmun on
Tuesday and Blackmun referred it to the full court on Wednesday.
   Reaction from state and local officials came swiftly.
   ``The ruling came as a complete shock to me and I don't
understand it,'' Gov. Bill Clinton said Wednesday.
   ``Very, very surprised, frustrated,'' was state Attorney General
Steve Clark's response. ``I actually didn't think the Supreme Court
would issue a stay.''
   In Russellville, where Simmons was arrested on Dec. 28, 1987,
after killing two residents in a shooting rampage, the opinion
voiced against the Supreme Court ruling was stronger.
   ``The decison stinks,'' Prosecutor John Bynum said. ``The Supreme
Court has let Jonas Whitmore, a convicted murderer, manipulate the
judicial system and it's just not right.''
   After Simmons was arrested in Russellville, authorities
discovered the bodies of his wife, seven children, two of the
children's spouses and four grandchildren at his home near Dover,
about 75 miles northwest of Little Rock.
   Bynum has prosecuted Simmons twice, winning a death sentence each
time. Simmons was first sentenced to death last year for the
Russellville murders. That execution was postponed by state and
federal courts considering the validity of Simmons' waiver of his
right to appeal.
   Clinton said Wednesday he would now set a death date for Simmons
in the conviction for the Russellville murders. But Clark said he
would expect the Supreme Court to stay any execution date for
Simmons while it considers the Whitmore petition.
   The stay is of indefinite duration, pending the filing of a
petition to the court asking it to review Simmons' case. If the
petition is denied by the court _ at least four of the nine justices
would have to vote to grant it _ the stay would be dissolved
automatically and Clinton could sign a death warrant for Simmons for
the family murders.
   The Arkansas Democrat, a Little Rock newspaper, published a
letter Wednesday from Simmons in which Simmons called Arkansas'
death penalty ineffective.
   ``One of the things I wanted to say in court (which would have
answered one of your questions) is that Arkansas does not have a
meaningful death penalty, it is a facade,'' Simmons wrote in
response to questions contained in a note given to him after a March
9 federal court hearing.

<TEXT>
   Radio signals beamed by a government
agency are jamming hundreds of automatic garage door openers in the
San Francisco Bay area.
   And the government says homeowners will just have to tough it out
and lift their garage doors themselves through May 2.
   Garage door companies have been swamped with complaints since
Friday, when residents discovered nothing happened when they tried
to use the remote-control devices.
   It's ``the worst problem I've seen in my 11 years in the
business,'' said Roger Brotherson, owner of Walnut Creek Overhead
Door Co., which has received 40 to 60 calls a day about the
interference.
   Tom Hora, a spokesman with the Federal Communications Commission
in Livermore, on Tuesday declined to identify the agency that has
been transmitting radio signals from atop Mount Diablo.
   But he warned that residents who can't turn the openers to
another frequency can expect the problem to persist through May 2.
   The problem has been reported in Concord, Orinda, Walnut Creek,
Lafayette, Moraga, Danville, San Ramon and Livermore.
   Garage door openers operate on radio frequencies used by the
government and others with authorization. Hora said the public
wasn't warned about the problem because openers are considered
``unprotected devices.''
   ``We're not obligated to do anything,'' he said. ``Normally,
though, if anyone were to contact us, we would let them know what
the situation is.''

   A soldier who was ordered to report to South
Korea and leave her infant daughter behind has won a delay of the
transfer but said today she still wants out of the Army.
   ``It has nothing to do with going to South Korea, really,'' Spec.
4 Cheryl Beekman, 21, said in an interview. ``I have a hard time
being in the military with a child.''
   Ms. Beekman sued on Tuesday seeking a discharge and an injunction
blocking Army orders that she report to South Korea on March 23. Ms.
Beekman, whose child is 6 months old, was told no dependents were
allowed on the assignment.
   The Army decided Wednesday to halt her transfer pending the
outcome of the federal court case, said George Solomon, a spokesman
for Fort Eustis in Newport News, where Ms. Beekman is stationed.
   ``If the court rules that everything that was done was legal,
then we have no alternative but to send her,'' he said.
   Ms. Beekman, a graphics illustrator, joined the Army for a
four-year hitch in 1986. When she became pregnant, Ms. Beekman was
given the opportunity under military law to request a discharge, but
she turned one down.
   However, after she gave birth in September and her husband,
Chris, left Virginia in October to take a job in Tacoma, Wash., she
found the dual role of mother and soldier too much too handle, she
said in court papers.
   ``I am just barely able to get myself up in the morning and am
tired all day at work,'' she said.
   An Army chaplain, two comanding officers and an Army staff judge
supported Ms. Beekman's request for a discharge to avert the
transfer, but Col. David A. Whaley, her group commander, overruled
their recommendations.
   Her attorney, Kenneth E. Labowitz, said he had found no previous
cases in which a military woman has gone to court seeking a
discharge so she could be with her child.
   ``They have greatly liberalized the rules regarding women in the
military generally,'' he said. ``But having opened up that
situation, that just creates new conflicts like this one.''

<HEAD>Three Palestinian Houses Destroyed, Two Sealed in Gaza Strip</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops today destroyed or sealed four
homes owned by Palestinians linked to a guerrilla group and
reportedly opened fire on Palestinian youths who threw stones in the
occupied Gaza Strip.
   Throughout the narrow coastal strip, Palestinian youths burned
tires, raised outlawed Palestinian flags and hurled rocks at troops,
who responded with gunfire, Arab reports said. There were no reports
of casualties.
   Protests by stone-throwing Palestinian school children prompted
Israeli authorities to close two Palestinian junior high schools in
Gaza City and the nearby village of Bani Suheila, reports said.
   Palestinian witnesses said troops used dynamite to blow up two
homes in the Rimal and Tufah neighborhoods of Gaza City after
imposing curfews and ordering family members to remove their
belongings.
   The homes were owned by two brothers who were arrested earlier
this month for allegedly belonging to a guerrilla squad linked to
PLO chief Yasser Arafat, the army said. The squad is accused of
killing two Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.
   ``This house belonged to my husband's 75-year-old father,'' Nadia
Abukhari said. ``My six children and I are now homeless.''
   Troops also sealed the homes of two other alleged squad members,
the army said.
   In the Jabaliya refugee camp, troops late Wednesday bulldozed the
home of a Palestinian lawyer wanted by Israeli authorities for
allegedly heading Jihad Islami, a fundamentalist Moslem group backed
by Fatah, the army said.
   The timing of the demolition appeared linked to an attempted
infiltration from Egypt on Wednesday by two Palestinian teen-agers
who said they belonged to Jihad Islami and were operating with the
backing of Fatah.
   Since the December 1987 start of the uprising, the army has
destroyed or sealed nearly 200 houses belonging to Palestinians
suspected of anti-Israeli violence. Usually, the houses are
demolished or sealed before a suspect stands trial. The United
States has condemned the practice, saying it violates the right to
due process before the law.

   Three homicides within six hours raised the
District of Columbia's homicide toll to a record pace of 110 for the
year, authorities said today.
   The deaths were the first fatal shootings here in at least 91
hours, police said, and compared with 67 homicides at this time last
year. The names of the victims were not released.
   The first victim died Wednesday night in what police described as
an execution-style slaying in the northwest section.
   The second victim was shot four times between two buildings at an
apartment complex in the city's southeast quadrant, according to
neighbors and police.
   The victim was pronounced dead at the Washington Hospital Center
a short time later. A nursing supervisor said, ``He was riddled with
bullets.''
   The third shooting death occurred early today in northeast
Washington when a man was found dead in a four-wheel-drive truck, a
vehicle that police say is popular with drug dealers.
   Police said they have no suspects or motives for the deaths, but
most previous homicides had been linked to the drug trade.
   The fatal shootings late Wednesday and early today were the first
since four men were killed within six hours Friday night.

   Britain secretly alerted airlines and airports
about a possible terrorist attack two days before a bomb blew Pan Am
Flight 103 out of the sky over Scotland, the Transport Department
has announced.
   It said in a statement Wednesday night the alert gave precise
details of a new type of bomb, hidden in a radio-cassette player,
similar to the device that on Dec. 21 destroyed Flight 103, killing
all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet and 11 on the ground in
Lockerbie.
   The alert was similar to an earlier warning sent out on Nov. 22,
but included a photo of the radio-cassette player, the department
said later.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, then changed
planes at London's Heathrow airport before heading for New York.
   A radio-cassette player containing plastic explosives and a
device that could be set to detonate the bomb at a given altitude
was found in October during raids by West German authorities in
which 13 alleged members of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command guerrilla group were
arrested.
   Pam Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman in New York, said today: ``There
is indeed a memo dated Dec. 19, but we did not receive it until Jan.
17. I am not going to say more than that.'' She said she did not
have the memo in front of her so she would not talk about what it
contained.
   Trans World Airlines was advised by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration on Nov. 18 of a bomb device found in Germany, and was
told the same thing by the British Department of Transport on Jan.
16, said Charles Adams, a senior vice president of TWA's
international division.
   Adams today said in London that ``people are reading an awful lot
of things into'' the fact that some airlines received the
information from the Departnent of Transport on Jan. 16. ``We had
received the same information from the FAA a month earlier,'' he
said.
   A British Airways spokesman said the airline received a telex on
Nov. 22, ``the day it was sent'' but refused to go into details of
what it said. He also said the airline received an alert on Dec. 19.
   ``We had full details, which we passed onto security staff,'' he
said. He declined to be named.
   Lawmaker John Prescott, the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on
transport, accused the government of mounting ``what can only be a
cover-up.''
   Two Americans who lost family members aboard Flight 103 today
said the plane should have been searched for a bomb before it left
for New York.
   The Transport Department said the alert from its principal
aviation security adviser, Jim Jack, followed an initial warning in
November of a possible bombing.
   It said: ``The barometric timing device indicated it was intended
to sabotage an aircraft. We sent advice to the relevant security
authorities. They were told what to look for. The American
authorities would have done the same for American airlines.''
   Asked why Transport Secretary Paul Channon had not mentioned the
Dec. 19 warning after the bombing, a department spokesman, who in
accordance with British practice declined to be further identified,
said: ``These are things that Mr. Channon may want to answer on in
due course.
   He said an initial warning was sent on Nov. 22, or 17 days before
a Dec. 9 warning by U.S. intelligence sources that a group planned
to bomb a Pan Am jet from Frankfurt within two weeks.
   The spokesman said some members of the group arrested in Germany
were still being detained while investigations continued into the
Lockerbie bombing.
   ``The case of the terrorist group in Frankfurt is being looked at
in relation to Lockerbie,'' he said.
   The London tabloid the Daily Mirror today called the latest
disclosure ``a huge embarrassment'' to Channon and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, who have come under pressure ``from anguished
relatives and members of Parliament to disclose how much the
government knew.''
   Raymond Germain, a Staten Island, N.Y. man whose 20-year-old
daughter Kathleen was killed aboard the plane, said the plane should
have been searched for a bomb.
   ``It's unconscionable. This plane should have never left the
ground until it was thoroughly checked,'' he said in an telephone
interview.
   Geraldine Buser of Glen Rock, N.J., told WCBS Radio: ``How the
hell am I supposed to feel if they knew this (the bomb) was going to
be there.''
   Ms. Buser, who lost her husband, Warren; son, Michael; and
daughter Lorraine Howe, said: ``If it's going to save a planeload of
people and you have a report that this thing might happen, it's
worth (waiting) two hours.''

<TEXT>
   Motorists in Dallas will soon be offered a window
decal allowing police to stop their car after hours to see if it is
stolen.
   Under a plan Police Chief Mack Vines is expected to reveal
Thursday, the sticker will be made available for free to interested
motorists and will alert police that the car should not be on the
street in the early morning.
   Under the law, police cannot normally stop a car without
``probable cause'' to believe a crime has been committed.
   More than 24,000 cars, worth $130.4 million, were stolen last
year in Dallas, a 22 percent increase over 1987. During January and
February of 1989, the auto theft rate was 38 percent higher than the
same months in 1988, police said.
   The stickers will serve as both a deterrent to auto theft and a
tool to catch thieves in the act, said Deputy Police Chief Richard
Schifelbein.
   Lt. Randy Jones of the department's auto theft division said the
decals will be designed like inspection stickers so they can't be
peeled off.
   ``A good auto thief won't want to take five minutes scraping off
a sticker so he can steal a car,'' he said.

   NASA said today the two solid fuel
booster rockets that helped thrust space shuttle Discovery into
orbit appeared to be in good condition as engineers began a detailed
inspection.
   The 149-foot rockets parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean 150 miles
offshore on Monday and were brought to shore by two recovery ships.
   Flight data and a look at the motors showed the rockets performed
well during Monday's launch and did not have any cork insulation
loss like that suspected of damaging shuttle tiles on the last
mission in December.
   The rockets were redesigned because a joint in one allowed flame
to escape and touched off the Chalenger explosion that killed seven
astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Royce Mitchell, project manager of the booster rocket program at
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, said Discovery's
boosters burned just 1.4 seconds longer than predicted during the
two minutes their motors were firing.
   ``We're very pleased with that kind of performance,'' he said.
   The twin boosters made up the third set of redesigned rockets
NASA has flown since returning the shuttle to flight in September.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas paralyzed bus services, sabotaged
power lines and staged sporadic attacks today in a stepped-up
campaign to disrupt Sunday's presidential election.
   Most bus drivers refused to work because rebels warned bus
companies to keep their vehicles off the nation's streets and gas
stations to remain closed. Many gas stations were guarded by troops
to prevent rebel attacks.
   ``It does not matter that we have the soldiers here. We can't
work because the workers have not come in,'' a watchman at one gas
station said.
   Much of the capital and the eastern half of the country was
without power after rebels destroyed electricity poles, the power
company said.
   Schools were closed throughout El Salvador, while army
helicopters and planes flew over the capital.
   One soldier was killed and four were wounded during a pre-dawn
guerrilla attack in Entre Rios, 40 miles east of San Salvador, the
military said.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella group
for the leftist guerrillas, also launched morning attacks in the
towns of Cinquera and Tejutepeque in the eastern department of
Cabanas and in the provincial capital of Zacatecoluca, officials
said. No casualties were immediately reported.
   In the capital, an army convoy waited outside the eastern bus
terminal to transport passengers to San Vicente, 30 miles to the
east, but few customers were seen early this morning.
   ``No one has come in. The owners are afraid. So are the people,''
said dispatcher Lazaro Lopez at San Salvador's western bus terminal.
Lopez said there normally are 300 bus departures and arrivals daily.
   The rebels have called for an election boycott and warned they
would sabotage any vehicle ignoring the transport ban. Such threats
have stopped about 90 percent of the nation's transport in the past.
   Private operators used flatbed and pickup trucks to transport
people throughout San Salvador, and some vehicles carried white
flags. News reports said citizens were offering similar transport
services in other cities.
   On Wednesday, when campaigning officially ended, rebels attacked
the presidential palace with grenades and bombs and killed a
prominent rightist political adviser in the capital.
   Also Wednesday, a civilian judge indicted two military officers
on charges of massacring 10 peasants. It was the first time in El
Salvador's nine-year civil war that officers have been indicted in a
human rights case.
   In Wednesday night's attack on the palace, shrapnel from a
rocket-propelled grenade injured a palace guard and six civilians
who live nearby, authorities said. The leftist rebels claimed
responsibility in a radio broadcast.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte was not present when the grenades
and catapult-launched homemade bombs began landing, said Col.
Ricardo Casanova, commander of the Zapote garrison next door.
   Unidentified gunmen on Wednesday killed Francisco Peccorini, a
political adviser to the Arena party. Peccorini was shot three times
while being driven in his car, authorities said.
   Alfredo Cristiani of Arena, or the Republican Nationalist
Alliance, is favored to win Sunday's vote, with Fidel Chavez Mena of
the Duarte's centrist Christian Democrats second and Guillermo Ungo
of the leftist Democratic Convergence third. If Arena wins, it would
be the first time in Salvadoran history that voters dumped an
incumbent party in favor of another.
   The military said it would provide armed escorts Sunday to
vehicles taking voters to the polls.
   The rebels have boycotted every election this decade as a farce,
accusing the government of ignoring the fundamental economic and
social problems of this Massachusetts-sized nation of 5.5 million
people.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the disappointment of curiosity seekers and law
enforcement agents, Chicago's top mobsters stayed away from the
funeral of reputed mob boss Joseph Ferriola.
   About 150 mourners, including two dozen women in furs and jewelry
and men in expensive tailored suits, paid their respects Wednesday
in a flower-filled salon at the Salerno Galewood Chapel on the
city's far West Side.
   But ``the big boys ... the people who are supposed to take over
(the crime syndicate in Chicago) didn't show up,'' said a man who
was comparing with another man the number of out-of-state licence
plates they had counted.
   ``This was a bustout,'' he said, ``and you can call me an
`informed source.'''
   The two men declined to identify themselves.
   The FBI and the Chicago Crime Commission, a private watchdog
group, would not comment on who attended the service or the burial
in suburban Hillside.
   Ferriola, who authorities said rose through the ranks and had run
the crime syndicate's day-to-day operations since 1973, died
Saturday in Houston after two heart transplants. He is survived by
his wife and five children.
   The prospect of a gangland funeral attracted dozens of
journalists, photographers and law agents.
   People watched from across the street in a restaurant parking lot
where Ferriola's fellow mobster, Charles ``Chuckie'' English was
gunned down in 1985.
   ``When they put the casket in the hearse, I thought that he is
really just an ordinary person and I felt sorry for his family,''
said Susan Trella, a neighborhood resident.

   Pop singer Jonathon ``Chico'' DeBarge
drew five years and eight months in prison for conspiring to bring
2.2 pounds of cocaine into Michigan from California.
   Hoping to convince U.S. District Judge Richard Enslen of his good
character, DeBarge, 22, sent Enslen press clippings, including one
about his anti-drug campaign at a junior high school less than a
month before his arrest.
   But the judge countered Wednesday, ``Who have you harmed by your

   DeBarge, his brother, Robert, and four other people were
convicted last year of conspiring to distribute cocaine.
   Robert DeBarge is serving a prison sentence of more than five
years.
   DeBarge, a Grand Rapids native who gained stardom last year with
a pop-funk album on the Motown label, is to report to prison April
12.

   The American flag made its final appearance on the
floor at a student art exhibit today, with three ledgers offering a
handwritten history of the rage, pain, sympathy and support that the
work provoked.
   The stage for the four weeks of heated debate was set by
``Dread'' Scott Tyler, 24, with his work ``What is the Proper Way to
Display the U.S. Flag?''
   Since the show opened at the School of the Art Institute, the
work has triggered demonstrations, debate on Capitol Hill, censure
by the state House, submission of tough new flag-protection
legislation in the state Senate and a lawsuit seeking the flag's
removal that was promptly dismissed by a judge.
   The exhibit opened this morning without incident, said school
spokeswoman Beth Sullivan. ``We expect it to be pretty quiet
today,'' she said.
   President Bush said Wednesday that he thought the
flag-on-the-floor exhibit is ``disgraceful'' but added that he would
be ``very wary'' of proposed legislation that would jail anyone for
setting up such a display.
   ``I'm always worried about the right of free speech,'' Bush said
in an Oval Office interview with the Chicago Sun-Times and five
other newspapers.
   Bush said he was disgusted by the exhibit because ``there's a
certain respect for the flag that American people have.''
   The controversy is all there in the ledgers that are part of the
work: anger and pain from veterans, comment on First Amendment
rights, opinions about Tyler's use of the flag as a powerful symbol,
and more.
   The authors number in the hundreds, with myriad viewpoints.
   A sampling:
   ``A cheap publicity stunt, not art. It's sad you had to desecrate
our flag to achieve recognition.''
   ``Well, Scott, you got what you wanted.''
   ``You should be put on the floor and walked on.''
   ``Good work at provoking a reaction. That's what art is supposed
to do.''
   ``Dude, you think this is cool well, it's not.''
   ``This took guts. If you believe in what you did, good for you.''
   ``If you don't like this country, move to a communist one.''
   ``You skunk _ my father's flag was drapped (sic) over his coffin
...''
   ``I think this is a lot of fuss over nothing.''
   ``Becky call Ed.''
   One visitor congratulated Tyler on enlisting viewers to complete
the piece with their comments _ ``living history.''
   Another bemoaned the ``myopia'' of visitors who ``neglect all the
art that surrounds them'' at the juried exhibit, which featured 66
minority-student works, mostly paintings.
   Viewers Wednesday were admitted in small groups for security
reasons and allowed about 10 minutes at the school's public gallery.
Many returned to the short line for another look.
   Security guards sighed with relief at the prospect of an end to
the exhibit that drew hostile visitors and even threats.
   And in front of the Art Institute, a downtown showcase, a handful
of protesters proudly waved American flags.
   Tyler intended the flag to be spread on the floor beneath a
framed, black-and-white montage featuring flag-draped coffins and
Third World anti-American protest, and the shelf containing the
ledgers.
   Protesters contend the arrangement invites visitors to walk on
the flag, a claim disputed by school officials.
   Tyler has called his work revolutionary and says he had no
apologies, despite death threats he said he and his mother have
received.
   ``The bad news is that the flag doesn't mean to the Scott Tylers
of this country what it means to so many of us,'' Robert Mars, Art
Institute vice president for administration, said earlier this week.
``The good news is that our system worked. The student was allowed
to make his statement.''

   An Angolan air force jet crashed while
landing at Huambo airport in central Angola, and the pilot was
killed, Angola's state-run news agency reported Thursday.
   The Soviet-built MiG-21 was destroyed in the crash Wednesday,
said the ANGOP agency in a report monitored in Lisbon. It identified
the dead pilot as Lt. Augusto Lourenco and said the crash occurred
while the jet was approaching the runway at Huambo.
   According to ANGOP, a commission set up to investigate the crash
ruled out the possibility rebels shot down the plane.
   The town of Huambo was once the main base of the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola rebel movement, and there have
been reports of heavy fighting in the region.
   ANGOP reported Thursday that forces of Angola's Marxist
government claimed to have killed 89 rebels and freed more than 200
civilians held by the rebels in clashes in Huambo province and other
parts of the country in the past week.
   In addition, seven rebel fighters and 25 of their civilian
supporters turned themselves over to government troops, ANGOP quoted
an army statement as saying.
   Four government soldiers died and 17 were wounded in the
fighting, and two were missing in action, ANGOP reported.
   The agency also said six civilians died and five were wounded
Monday when a mine planted by rebels exploded in the Cacola region,
South Lunda province.

   China's policy of one child per couple and
restrictions on early marriages are being widely ignored, according
to a State Planning Commission survey released Thursday.
   Results of the survey said that since the one-child policy was
started in 1980, about 9 million babies a year have been born
outside the state plan.
   Family Planning Commission head Peng Peiyun said the survey was
an ``alarm bell.'' She said the average Chinese couple between 1980
and 1987 had 2.47 children.
   Last year there were approximately 23 million births and 7
million deaths in China, pushing the nation's population close to
1.1 billion.
   The two-year survey, which covered 2 million people, found that
women bearing two or more children accounted for 40 percent of the
unauthorized births. About one-fifth of the unauthorized births were
to women under 20, which is the legal age for women in China to
marry, the People's Daily said in reporting results of the survey.
   The survey found that less than 60 percent of women of
child-bearing age practice birth control.
   The government has had substantial success in limiting family
sizes in cities but has met strong resistance in the countryside.
Rural couples, wanting boys in particular to help in the fields and
to care for them when they become old, have been willing to pay
steep fines for violating the one-child policy.
   The government has acknowledged that its target of limiting
population to 1.2 billion in the year 2000 is not possible.
Estimates for the number of Chinese at the turn of the century have
jumped to 1.3 billion, about 20 percent of total world population.

   Foreign diplomats and wealthy executives
are smuggling more than $10 million of gold and emeralds out of the
country every year, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   To curb the trafficking, the independent Chamber of Mines is
pressing for tougher laws, and the government is considering setting
up a special police unit, The Herald said.
   Most of the smuggled gold is bought from prospectors illegally
panning from rivers and streams, Chamber chief executive Derek Bain
was quoted as saying.
   The Harare Mining Commissioner estimates panners yield 1,653
pounds of gold a year, but only 3{ pounds are sold to the state
Minerals Marketing Corporation, according to the report.
   Under Zimbabwean law, all gold from the country must be sold only
to the Corporation or the Reserve Bank.
   Zimbabwe's main emerald mine, Rio Tinto, exports $2 million of
the gems each year, according to the Minerals Marketing Corporation.
But a similar amount, stolen from Rio Tinto or illegally mined
elsewhere, is believed to be smuggled out, the corporation said.
   The mining executives did not identify the nationalities of the
diplomats reported to be involved in the racket.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Legislation to Open Arctic Refuge to Oil Exploration.</HEAD>

   A Senate committee today approved legislation
to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration,
rejecting an amendment to delay it until a national energy plan is
developed.
   The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources adopted a
proposal by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., that would allow drilling
while a study on energy conservation is under way.
   An amendment to the bill that would have delayed any drilling
until the interior secretary presented Congress with a comprehensive
energy plan was defeated on a 12-7 vote.
   Committee Chairman Bennett Johnston, D-La., called the amendment,
offered by Sens. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., a
``killer amendment'' that would effectively stop any oil drilling in
the refuge.
   ``We have been studying energy policy in this committee for 17
years,'' Johnston said. More conservation is needed, he said, but in
the meantime more domestic oil production must begin.
   Estimates as to the amount of oil that may be found in the refuge
vary, with the minimum put at 3.2 billion barrels.
   The bill, which pits conservationists against development
interests, now goes to the Senate floor for a vote. It has not been
taken up by the House.
   The measure was introduced last session, but failed to get a vote
on the floor of either the House or Senate.
   On Wednesday, the committee refused to tie a requirement that
cars be more fuel efficient to the drilling legislation.
   That amendment, offered by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said
American cars would have to get an average 34 miles to the gallon by
the year 2000, or the manufacturer would be penalized.
   ``We would get more oil from the Metzenbaum amendment than we
would from ANWR (the wildlife refuge),'' said Wirth.
   Bumpers said he might be persuaded to vote in favor of searching
for oil in the refuge, ``but it doesn't make sense to use it in gas
guzzlers.''
   He said Americans have ``gotten fat and happy,'' are buying big
cars and are not serious about dealing with ``an energy crisis that
is coming just as certainly as God made little green apples.''
   In opposing the amendment, Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said
the committee did not have jurisdiction over auto mileage, and that
it should go through the commerce committee.
   He said as much as 9 billion barrels of oil might be found in the
refuge, lessening U.S. dependence on imported fuel.
   Other estimates have put the expected production to be about 4
billion barrels. The refuge, which is just east of Prudhoe Bay, is
the breeding ground for one of North America's largest remaining
herds of migratory caribou and the home of wildlife such as polar
bear, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes, waterfowl and fish.
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said the Metzenbaum amendment could
raise the cost of automobiles and cause layoffs in the industry. It
was defeated on a 9-9 vote.

<TEXT>
   Commuters jammed buses and taxis and
clashes broke out in at least one subway station Thursday after
thousands of city subway workers went on strike to demand the
system's president resign.
   Subway President Kim Myong-nong ordered strikers to return to
work by early Friday or face disciplinary action. Union officials
refused.
   Subway officials said about 6,000 of the system's 7,732 employees
participated in the strike, the first extended work stoppage in the
Seoul Subway Corp.'s 15-year history. More than 2,300 strikers were
arrested.
   A sudden snowstorm that hit Seoul during the morning added to
congestion and confusion in city streets clogged with heavy traffic.
   The 3 million people who use the subway daily in this city of
about 10 million struggled to find alternate transportation. Buses
were packed with riders, and taxis carried up to five passengers.
   Union leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity said they would
stay on strike until their demands for Kim's resignation were met
and all arrested strikers were released and charges dropped.
   Union leaders accuse Kim of acting in bad faith during labor
negotiations last week. The talks resulted in an agreement on new
pay and working conditions, but strikers said they do not trust the
subway corporation to live up to the deal.
   Strikers also demanded withdrawal of lawsuits against labor
leaders who organized protests last week in which subway workers
allowed commuters to ride free.
   ``The strike will probably continue for a few days as police have
detained thousands of protesters and most union members are ready to
resist the government's stern measures,'' one union official said.
   About 4,000 riot police raided a subway depot in eastern Seoul to
disperse 3,000 strikers who had seized the facility overnight and
erected barricades. Armored trucks fired tear gas, and bulldozers
removed the barricades.
   Some strikers hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, but they
were overpowered in less than 30 minutes. Police said 2,344 strikers
were arrested at the depot.
   Police said most of those arrested would be released by Friday
but that 30 would be charged with organizing an illegal strike.
   The government mobilized more than 10,000 extra buses, trucks and
cars to provide emergency service. Government workers were
instructed to report to work one hour late and school pupils one
hour early to help reduce traffic.
   Limited service was provided on some subway lines by managers,
non-striking workers and drivers drafted from the national railroad
system, subway officials said.
   The officials reported that the city's four subway lines operated
at 54 percent of their capacity.
   Mayor Koh Kun apologized to commuters for the inconvenience. ``We
want the strikers to return to work and drop their unjust demands,''
he said.
   The strikers have demanded that Koh sign the new labor agreement,
but Koh said he could not do that because he did not represent the
corporation.
   The only previous strike by subway workers was a two-hour
stoppage in June 1988.

<HEAD>Lewis Won't Run for House GOP Whip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., today formally took
himself out of the race for the No. 2 leadership job among House
Republicans, but another GOP member vowed to nominate Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois for the job and make it a three-way contest.
   Lewis, who as chairman of the House Republican Conference now
holds the third-ranking job in the GOP hierarchy, made no formal
endorsement when he announced his decision at a news conference.
   But he described the job of Republican whip, which is being
vacated by Rep. Dick Cheney so he can become President Bush's
secretary of defense, as one that demands an ability to reach out to
Republicans of all ideologies and to Democrats as well.
   That description seemed to point to Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill.,
the current deputy whip and longtime inside legislative tactician
who is running for the job with the quiet support of Minority Leader
Robert Michel.
   Lewis characterized the other candidate, Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, as a talented and energetic lawmaker but one whose talents
might be best suited to helping run the GOP political campaign
apparatus.
   At the end of Lewis' news conference Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.,
made a surprise appearance to tell reporters that he would nominate
Hyde, a conservative House veteran, for the post ``whether some like
it or not.''
   Hyde had decided a day earlier not to make the race, but Solomon
said that decision was the result of pressure from the Illinois
delegation, which didn't want Madigan's support to be diluted.
   Solomon said Hyde should be the heir-apparent to Michel, who is
expected to retire in the next few years, and should therefore be
installed now as whip.
   Both Gingrich and Madigan, who have been soliciting support since
Cheney was nominated last Friday, claimed to have majority support
among the 174-member House Republican Conference.
   The contest was seen largely as one of style, and to some extent
one of generations and ideology.
   Gingrich, a six-term lawmaker best known for his attacks on House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was generally favored by conservative
colleagues who believe the party's current leadership is too
unwilling to do high-profile warfare with the ruling Democrats.
   Madigan was seen by many as someone who has paid his dues as the
senior Republican on the House Agriculture Committee and as an
inside player on various GOP legislative initiatives.
   Leadership sources said soon after Madigan announced last Friday
that he planned to make the whip's race, Michel voiced his support
and has been quietly campaigning for his Illinois colleague, who is
closer to his style.

<HEAD>Satellite Facing Budget Ax Helps Locate Earthquake Faults</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have discovered a series of unknown
earthquake faults thanks to pictures from a satellite that has been
facing the budget ax.
   The faults are located in the central and eastern parts of
California's Mojave Desert and were found using images taken by the
Landsat satellite, according to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The faults were discovered by studying a series of images taken
in differing optical and infrared spectra, according to scientists
at NASA`s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and at
Louisiana State University.
   Some of the faults are inactive, but others may still be
seismically active, the scientists said. The faults form part of a
complex fault region between Death Valley and the San Andreas fault
region.
   Without the Landsat images, the faults would not have been
discovered, said John Ford of NASA.
   His announcement was made even as scientists and politicians were
struggling over financing to keep the Landsat system going.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced
recently that it would have to shut down the Landsat system at the
end of this month because of a lack of money to operate it.
   Subsequently Vice President Dan Quayle began encouraging other
government agencies to chip in funds to keep the system going and
the cutoff has at least been delayed.
   Landsat, which studies the Earth's surface for mapping, mineral
studies and other research, still faces a tenuous financual future,
however.

<HEAD>Tibetan Leader Optimistic Chinese Will Negotiate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tibetans' spiritual leader, the Dalai
Lama, said Thursday he believes Beijing is ready for negotiations
that would grant greater freedom to his people and the land he fled
30 years ago.
   In an interview at his exile headquarters in the remote Himalayan
foothills of north India, the Dalai Lama admitted he has had no
recent indication of this from Chinese authorities.
   In fact, the Tibetan capital of Lhasa has been under martial law
since bloody anti-Chinese protests there last week.
   But the Dalai Lama adhered to his belief that change is sweeping
China, that the new concept of reform in the Soviet Union will soon
come to the world's other major communist power.
   ``Within a few months, talks may start,'' the Dalai Lama said.
   In the meantime, he said, he will continue to support non-violent
protest in Tibet.
   ``Peaceful demonstrations _ that I am supporting. That is the
only way to make (our situation) known to the outside world,'' the
Dalai Lama said.
   Tibetans ``should not indulge in damaging and burning property.
They should not indulge in stoning. Even if the Chinese open fire,
they should not retaliate,'' he said.
   The Dalai Lama spoke at midafternoon in the hilltop compound that
houses his residence, offices, Thekchen Choeling Temple and Namgyal
Monastery where maroon-robed monks debate ancient scriptures and
venerate this bespectacled, 54-year-old farmer's son as a living
god-king, the 14th reincarnation of the earthly manifestation of
Buddha.
   On another March 16 afternoon, exactly 30 years ago, the Dalai
Lama was in a more remote and far grander Himalayan compound, in
Lhasa. Surrounded by Chinese troops who had moved their artillery
within range of his palace, the Dalai Lama and his advisers were at
the brink of the decision that would propel him and eventually
110,600 other Tibetans into exile.
   By the night of March 17, he had slipped out of Lhasa's
Norbulinka Palace disguised as a Tibetan soldier and shouldering a
rifle. By April 18, 1959, he was safe in India, free to speak
against China.
   But the Tibetans' uprising had failed. The Chinese guns had
bombarded Norbulinka, and thousands of Tibetans were dead.
   It was the approach of this anniversary that resulted in more
bloodshed in Lhasa last week.
   By official count, 16 people were killed when police opened fire
during a pro-independence demonstration in Lhasa in which
Chinese-owned shops and vehicles were set afire. Western travelers
said as many as 20 or 30 were killed.
   China's subsequent ban on foreigners entering Tibet makes it
impossible for the outside world to know with any certainty what is
happening in the ancient kingdom, which Chinese troops entered in
1950.
   Beijing maintains Tibet has traditionally been part of China. The
Dalai Lama and his government in exile say Tibet has been
independent for centuries.
   ``In the last few days, you see a sad situation within Tibet,''
the Dalai Lama said, a long shawl of finely spun wool protecting him
from the mountain chill.
   ``In the last 30 years, they (the Chinese) have used every
repression,'' he said, speaking in English. ``We lost everything in
the last 30 years, but we still remain. We are the same Tibetans the
Chinese bullied 30 years ago.''
   Despite the imposition of martial law, the Dalai Lama said he
thought China's eagerness to open its economy to the outside world
would bring greater awareness and greater tolerance to political
problems at home.
   Reflecting a sense that time may be running out, that an influx
of Chinese settlers in Tibet would obliterate the separate Tibetan
identity, the Dalai Lama last June made his biggest concession to
date.
   He proposed his homeland become ``a self-governing democratic
political entity . . . In association with China.''
   In return, he said China could retain troops on Tibetan soil and
handle Tibet's foreign policy.
   China rejected the proposal, saying it failed to relinquish the
concept of Tibetan independence, but it said it was willing to talk
to the Dalai Lama.
   The Dalai Lama on Thursday repeated that talks should start at a
lower level, in a neutral spot outside Chinese control.
   ``If the Chinese do not want to talk, OK. The last 30 years we
spent like this,'' he said.

   The world's land areas have become wetter over
the last century or so, but the rainfall increases have skipped
large areas of the planet, according to a study released Thursday.
   South America and Australia have seen measurable increases in
precipitation since the late 1800s, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration reported.
   At the same time, however, there has been a decline in Africa and
in tropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere.
   The analysis of rainfall patterns was compiled by NOAA's Henry F.
Diaz, R.S. Bradley of the University of Massachusetts and Jon
Eischeid of the University of Colorado. Their findings are to be
published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Geophysical
Research.
   The scientists looked at nearly a century of records. Diaz said
the primary period of increasing rainfall in the Southern Hemisphere
was from the 1940s to the mid-1950.
   In the Northern Hemisphere, the overall trend is almost
unchanged, he said, noting, however, that there seems to have been a
decline in rainfall in northern tropical areas in the last 15 years
or so.
   Rainfall patterns show substantial variability from time to time,
the scientists noted, changing over periods of a decade or more.
   Thus, they said, it is difficult to determine whether rainfall
has been affected by long-term phenomena such as that embodied in
the Greenhouse theory, which predicts that changes in the atmosphere
will cause worldwide temperatures to warm, leading to changes in
rainfall and other climate phenomena.

   Dick Cheney, the Wyoming congressman about to
become secretary of defense, is tackling one of the most difficult
management jobs in government with only an outsider's knowledge of
modern weapons and with the extra weight of a late start.
   ``All the problems are compounded'' for Cheney, says Caspar W.
Weinberger, who served almost seven years in the job.
   ``Two months have gone by, a great many trains are leaving the
station and they all have to be caught at once,'' Weinberger said in
an interview Thursday.
   ``He's a fine choice and he will be very good. But he faces a
very daunting task.''
   Other officials still inside the Pentagon, who asked not to be
named, say it's possible for a congressman to jump into the huge
military bureaucracy and shine.
   For example, one said, Melvin Laird did well in the Nixon
administration. And Cheney, who like Laird held a leadership post
among House Republicans, is no stranger to most of the big issues,
the official added.
   But Cheney is about to leap from running a Capitol Hill office
with relatively few employees to becoming the boss of 3.1 million
people. And he is doing so with little time to select key assistants
and aides.
   The first important job he'll face is trimming the fiscal 1990
budget. And he's never played that peculiar brand of Pentagon
politics.
   ``Dick Cheney is about to walk into this job right when it's time
to play referee among four services that are attacking each other in
hopes of saving their own budget,'' said one official.
   President Bush already has ordered the Pentagon to slash about
$6.4 billion from its fiscal 1990 budget proposal ``and now it's
dog-eat-cat time,'' the source said.
   Weinberger recalled such military budget fights, saying,
``Everybody has recommendations of their own _ their own hopes and
needs _ and there's never enough for everybody. ... It will be very,
very tough'' for Cheney.
   To make matters worse, the congressman doesn't have the detailed
military-program knowledge possessed by Bush's first choice for the
job, John Tower.
   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
was widely known for his exhaustive knowledge of such details. His
personal life, however _ including allegations of excessive drinking
and womanizing and his financial relationships with military
contractors _ led to rejection of his nomination last week.
   Cheney, by contrast, after being lauded for his honor and
integrity, was approved 20-0 Thursday by the Armed Services
Committee and is expected to clear the full Senate without
opposition Friday.
   One Pentagon official said anyone who sets his mind to it can
learn what weapons the nation depends on, how they work, how they're
produced and how much they cost.
   ``But that takes time, and Cheney doesn't have any,'' he said.
   Tower knew the inside politics, the ``games between the services
and program quirks,'' another source said.
   As if setting budget priorities were not enough, Cheney also will
have only about a month to help Bush make broad decisions that will
affect national security for years to come.
   For example, the administration must decide whether the United
States needs a mobile nuclear missile to deter Soviet attack and, if
so, what type and how large it should be. The administration also
must decide how fast it will attempt to build B-2 stealth bombers _
a decision with huge financial implications.
   Other pending decisions include how vigorously to develop a
``Star Wars'' anti-missile defense system, whether to continue
supporting a Navy built around 15 aircraft carriers, whether
military manpower should be cut, what goals to aim for in
negotiating a nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union, and how to
walk the tightrope of safeguarding Europe while negotiating
reductions to conventional arms.
   ``He's going to have to do about 14 or 15 things at once,'' says
Weinberger, who was sworn in as secretary of defense just one day
after Ronald Reagan began his presidency.
   ``It's too bad he lost these months.''

   Blacks die more often as infants and have
shorter, harsher lives if they survive. They have more trouble
getting jobs, are more likely to be poor and suffer more violent
crime and divorces.
   In an America that is far from colorblind, the quality of black
life from cradle to grave is worse than it is for whites and the
gaps are widening in some areas, according to recent studies.
   ``There are still deep inequalities between the races,'' said
Billy Tidwell, director of research for the National Urban League in
Washington. ``The nation cannot allow such a significant part of its
citizenry to experience such disadvantages.''
   A black child born in 1986 can expect to die six years sooner
than a white child, according to a report released Wednesday by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   Life expectancy among whites rose from 75.3 years to 75.4 years
between 1984 and 1986. For blacks, the number dropped from 69.7 to
69.4.
   Among the culprits that shorten black lives are infant mortality,
murders, AIDS and pneumonia.
   Of 1,000 black babies born in 1984, 18.4 died before they were a
year old. The mortality rate for white babies was 9.4 per 1,000
births, according to the national Centers for Disease Control.
   Low birth weight and lack of proper medical care were the main
causes of death, the CDC said. A black baby is three times more
likely than a white one to be born to a mother who had no prenatal
care, according to a 1989 study by the Urban League.
   In 1986, there were 22,000 murders. Almost half the victims were
black, and the murder rate is almost six times higher for blacks
than whites. Black males are nearly as likely to be murdered as they
are to die in a car accident, the government said.
   Blacks make up 12 percent of the population but are twice as
likely to get AIDS.
   Influenza and pneunomia caused 28 of each 100,000 deaths among
black men, far higher than the 18 per 100,000 rate posted for white
men.
   Other studies show disproportionate differences between the races.
   The poverty rate for blacks in 1986 was 31.1 percent, compared
with the 11 percent rate for whites, the U.S. Census Bureau said.
The black rate is worse than the 1969 figure of 28 percent.
   The jobless rate among blacks in 1987 was 13 percent, 2.5 times
the 5.3 percent rate for whites. If agencies counted blacks who were
so discouraged they have quit looking for work, the rate would
approach 25 percent, according to the National Committee for Full
Employment.
   The median black family income was $17,604 compared with $30,809
for whites, according to the Urban League. That same year, 44.2
percent of black families had incomes of less than $10,000, more
than triple the rate for whites.
   In black families, single women are more apt to be in charge.
   Black males have the highest death rates from accidents and
violence of any ethnic group with 153 per 100,000. The white rate is
98.6 per 100,000, according to a 1984 Urban League report.
   The divorce rate among blacks jumped from 45 per 1,000 marriages
in 1960 to 178 per 1,000 marriages in 1981. White couples divorced
at the rate of 27 per 1,000 in 1960 and 82 per 1,000 in 1981, the
report said.
   ``Black males run a deadly gauntlet of dangers that cause a
steady attrition in the number of men who can support families,''
said James McGhee, an Urban League researcher.
   According to the 1980 Census report, elderly blacks were 3.5
times as likely as older whites to live in dwellings without
plumbing. About 44 percent of homes occupied by blacks lacked
central heating.
   In 1985, elderly non-whites, mostly blacks, were five times as
likely to be slaying victims than whites, and non-white males were
2.7 times more likely to be robbery victims than elderly white
males, according to the National Caucus and Center on Black Aged.
   Black males had the greatest slippage in college enrollment among
any racial or ethnic group over the past decade, according to a
study in January by the American Council on Education. Enrollment
dropped from 4.3 percent in 1976 to 3.5 percent by 1986.
   Blacks also earned the fewest degrees and made the least progress
in number of faculty positions held.
   ``Those who do manage to attend college find considerable racism
and chilly environments on many white campuses,'' said the report by
Deborah J. Carter and Reginald Wilson.
   Fair housing is also a challenge, according to a February study
in Social Science Quarterly.
   An Asian or Hispanic who has finished third-grade has a higher
probability of living in an integrated neighborhood than a black
with a doctorate, the study said. And an Asian or Hispanic who makes
less than $2,500 a year has a higher chance of living in an
integrated neighborhood than a black who earns more than $50,000.
   ``Blacks are exposed to higher crime rates, less effective
educational systems, higher mortality risks, more dilapidated
surroundings and a poorer socio-economic environment than whites,''
said researcher Nancy Denton of the University of Chicago.
``Integration is possible, even likely, for all ethnic and racial
groups except blacks.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today ordered South
Padre Island to let a Christian group hand out religious literature
on the beach during the annual exercise in excess known as spring
break.
   The group had sued the resort town after being warned of an
ordinance against solicitation on the beach.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela said today that ``the public
beaches are a public forum,'' and he advised the town that
distribution of religious literature is protected under the
Constitution.
   He ended the hearing by telling both sides, ``God bless you,
gentlemen.''
   South Padre officials have estimated that 200,000 to 300,000
students will converge on the island resort near the mouth of the
Rio Grande in March. A rock concert on the beach is scheduled for
Friday.
   Kevin Pitt, a minister at Brownsville's interdominational Word of
God Family Church, said his Youth Ministry Network wants to provide
an alternative to the companies promoting beer and condoms to the
spring-breakers.
   City Manager Eddie Campirano said the town had not tried to
single out any one group with its ordinance, which he said applies
to commercial as well as religious solicitation.
   ``When the public is out there on the beach, they have a right to
be out there and enjoy it and be left alone,'' he said.

<HEAD>Elderly Man Dies After Apparently Becoming Disoriented In Storm</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An 83-year-old man believed to have
become disoriented while driving during a snowstorm strayed 40 miles
from his destination and died, possibly from a heart attack.
   The body of Henry Petrie of Golden Valley was found Wednesday in
his burned-out truck, which was in a ditch near the central
Minnesota city of Monticello, police said.
   Petrie had been on his way to pick up his wife at work in St.
Louis Park, seven miles from their home, during a storm that dumped
more than 7 inches of snow Tuesday.
   Authorities speculate Petrie, who had a heart ailment, became
disoriented in the rush-hour storm, took the wrong route and had a
heart attack, causing the vehicle to veer into a ditch.
   One theory is that the truck's accelerator pedal stuck, causing
the tires to spin then heat to the point of catching fire.
   The body was found about 13 hours after Petrie's wife, Delores,
filed a missing-person report, said Golden Valley police Sgt. Gary
Quarnstrom.

   Groundskeepers at Wrigley Field went on strike
today, and laborers installing skyboxes at the Chicago Cubs ballpark
honored the picket lines.
   The National League team assured fans that the walkout will not
disrupt operations at the ballpark this season, which opens in three
weeks.
   The groundskeepers began picketing outside the field at midnight
after contract talks with the Cubs broke down Monday, said Richard
Malkowsky, union secretary-treasurer. The old contract expired Dec.
31.
   Construction workers getting skyboxes ready for the National
League opener April 4 joined the picket line when they arrived for
work in the morning, said police Sgt. Ed Kehoe. He estimated more
than 150 persons picketed or honored the lines.
   Malkowsky said about 300 building-trades workers refused to cross
picket lines. The 24 groundskeepers are paid an average of $21,000 a
year, he said.
   ``They (Cubs management) didn't have enough time to slot us in
for scheduled talks because they were busy giving millions of
dollars away to the ballplayers,'' he said.
   Union attorney Don Cohn said the ballplayers union also will be
asked to join in when they return from spring training in Mesa,
Ariz., but Malkowsky said, ``I'm hoping we can resolve it before the
season starts.''
   The groundskeepers walked out over a management effort to cut
nearly in half their $14-an-hour wage and win other concessions,
said Sam Bongiorno, a 23-year veteran of the groundskeeping crew.
   The team said in a statement, ``The Cubs are certainly willing to
continue negotiations but, in any event, we assure our fans that
this will not disrupt operations at the ballpark this season.''
   Cubs officials declined to discuss the strike further.
   No new talks were scheduled, Cohn said.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American soldier has been
charged with espionage for allegedly handing over U.S. defense
secrets to communist East Germany, the Army announced today.
   American military authorities said they filed the charges against
Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri, who recently disappeared for 11 days near
the East German border. He turned himself in to military authorities
last week.
   He also brought back a lap-top computer he took from his unit,
where he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist,
officials have said.
   One Army officer told The Associated Press the East Germans
notified U.S. officials that Peri had contacted them, but it was not
immediately clear why the communist country would have done that.
   In a statement sent to the news media, the U.S. Army said Peri
``has been charged with espionage _ communicating documents and@or
information relating to national defense to the German Democratic
Republic (GDR).''
   The statement said Peri was charged with ``moving classified
documents to the GDR and transferring classified information to
unauthorized persons.''
   It provided no further details about the information allegedly
handed over to the East Germans and said no date has been set for
the soldier's trial.
   A 5th Corps spokesman, Lt. Col. Jake Dye, told The Associated
Press: ``He gave them information. We're just not in a position to
say what it was.''
   A deputy spokesman, Maj. Samuel Taylor, said in an interview:
``It is U.S. national defense information as far as it pertains to
our NATO mission and to the general defense plan as a NATO force.''
   Taylor said that ``the evidence we have that he crossed the
border was given to us by the GDR Ministry of Foreign Affairs.'' He
said, ``We were told by the (East German) ministry Peri made contact
with them.''
   Peri disappeared Feb. 21 from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment
in Fulda, 65 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   Some officials speculated that he defected because a military
vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near the town of Obersuhl, a
remote rural area northeast of Fulda and near the East German border.
   U.S. officials said Peri worked as an electronics warfare signal
specialist. He was responsible for operating equipment that detects
enemy radar and other signals. He has been stationed in West Germany
since March 1988.
   The Army communique said Peri also was charged with ``failure to
obey the lawful regulations that require him to get permission to
travel to the German Democratic Republic.'' The regulations also
require soldiers to check with their security officer ``before going
into a communist-controlled country.''
   The statement did not say where Peri went inside East Germany or
how he crossed the heavily guarded border.
   Peri, who was being held in pretrial confinement in Mannheim,
West Germany, already has been charged with being absent without
leave and other offenses.
   The 21-year-old soldier comes from Laguna Niguel, Calif.
   Before today's announcement, Army officials described Peri as ``a
good clean-cut soldier'' who had a ``perfect record.''
   ``In fact, he had been promoted and nominated for `Soldier of the
Month' twice in the year he has been here,'' an Army spokesman, Lt.
Col. Jake Dye, said earlier this month. ``That's what makes it so
baffling.''
   Officials who thought Peri had defected recalled that in March
1987, U.S. Army Pvt. Wade E. Roberts, 22, of Riverside, Calif.,
defected with his West German girlfriend to the Soviet Union.
   Roberts returned to the United States in November 1987 and was
court-martialed as a deserter. He was given a bad conduct discharge
after being found guilty of the lesser charge of being absent
without leave.

<HEAD>Three Magistrates Arrested, 2 Policemen Suspended in Torture Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities arrested three town
magistrates and suspended two Asuncion police officers accused of
torturing prisoners during the dictatorship of Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner, officials said Thursday.
   The arrests and suspensions are part of a campaign launched by
Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who toppled Stroessner in a Feb. 3 coup.
   The magistrates, who have executive and judicial powers akin to
those of a mayor or justice of the peace, were accused in the 1979
deaths of 24-year-old Adolfo Irala and his brothers, Victor, 19, and
Sindulfo, 27. They died in Tebicuarymi, a town 80 miles southeast of
Asuncion.
   The mother of the three, Leonora Irala, told human rights lawyers
her sons were tortured by electric shock and had their teeth pulled
out with pliers.
   ``My sons' cries and screams for help could be heard in the whole
town,'' Mrs. Irala was quoted as telling the Asuncion newspaper El
Diario.
   She said her sons were detained and tortured for five days in
connection with the slaying of the son of the local ward president
of the ruling Colorado Party.
   Formal charges have not been filed against Tebicuarymi
magistrates Elvio Reyes, Ruben Fernandez and Salustiano Gimenez,
authorities said.
   Police announced the suspension of Asuncion officers Augusto
Caceres Spelt and Camilo Almada Saprissa, who have been accused of
torture during the Stroessner regime.
   Lawyers for human rights organizations said dozens of formal
complaints were filed against those two and others but never were
acted upon.
   ``I know of at least 100 different suits against Almada Saprissa
for torture,'' said Francisco Vargas, a human rights lawyer for the
Committee of Churches.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Artemio Nunez said, ``They will be
given the opportunity to defend themselves.''
   ``We can't be unjust even with those who are unjust with us,'' he
added.
   The campaign against torture began a month ago when Interior
Minister Orlando Machuca Vargas pledged to eliminate torture
chambers in police stations and urged citizens who had been tortured
to file legal complaints.
   Stroessner ruled Paraguay 34 years before being overthrown in a
bloody coup by Rodriguez, who had been his second-in-command in the
army. Stroessner was accused of brutal repression of opponents
during his rule, and the Reagan administration in 1976 labeled his
government a dictatorship.
   He has lived in Brazil since the coup.

   A high school has new science equipment
courtesy of a businessman who went to a sheriff's auction and bought
beakers, scales and other items seized in a raid on a drug lab.
   Tom Goodner, owner of the three local supermarkets, purchased the
flatbed load of equipment for $1,400 and donated it to Duncan High
School ``so it can be put to good use instead of bad use.''
   District Attorney Melvin Singleterry suggested the idea to
Goodner, who beat out a couple of others bidding Wednesday on the
material, which was seized in town in 1987.
   Principal Larry David estimated the equipment would have cost
$15,000 if the school tried to buy it new. He said the items should
be enough for several years.

   The U.S. government joined friends and
relatives of Terry Anderson today in urging the journalist's captors
in Lebanon to release him immediately on his fourth anniversary as a
hostage.
   The continued detention of Anderson and other hostages in Lebanon
``is a criminal act which serves no cause,'' State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said in a statement.
   ``The hostage-holders should release their captives immediately
and unconditionally, and we call on all countries with influence
over the hostages, such as Iran, to use that influence to obtain
freedom for all the hostages,'' Redman said.
   President Bush ``certainly is concerned about the hostages,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Houston, where Bush
was making a speech. He said the United States will continues
efforts to seek the release of Anderson and eight other American
hostages.
   At a ceremony on Capitol Hill marking Anderson's fourth year as a
captive, his sister, Peggy Say of Cadiz, Ky., said Anderson, a
correspondent for The Associated Press, is ``frustrated, tired and
lonely ... and tired of being caged like an animal.''
   In a message transmitted to the news agency's staff, AP President
Louis D. Boccardi said ``our hearts cry out in protest'' over
Anderson's plight.
   ``It's time for those holding Terry Anderson to release him and
to end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man. Each of us
in our own special way should mark this day with contemplation and
prayer for Terry's release,'' Boccardi continued.
   ``As has been true from the beginning on that Saturday morning in
1985, our efforts on his behalf will continue in all corners of the
world until our brave friend is free once more.''
   Tom Brokaw of NBC News, who moderated an hour-long ceremony in a
House office building, said Anderson has not been forgotten as he
enters his fifth year as a captive in a small, dingy room.
   ``We can't turn our backs when people are denied human rights,''
Brokaw said.
   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former hostage held for a time
with Anderson, said that before his release on July 26, 1986, he
promiseed the journalist ``that I would never forget him, that
others would never forget him.''
   Colleagues who knew and worked with Anderson, one of nine
American hostages held in Lebanon, talked of his dedication to his
job and his desire to tell the story of the war-torn nation.
   ``He took big risks ... and he has paid an awful price these last
four years,'' said David Ignatius, an associate editor of The
Washington Post. ``I want to see Terry released tomorrow, if
possible.''
   Thomas Friedman, diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times,
said the radical Moslem Shiites believed to hold Anderson are
damaging Islam's image by keeping hostages. ``The only way your
story is ever going to be told again is if our comrades are free,''
he said.
   Bruce Laingen, a former hostage in Iran, echoed that thought. The
hostage-holders are doing a ``grievous disservice to Islam,'' he
said at the event, which was co-sponsored by No Greater Love, a
humanitarian organization, and the Journalists Committee to Free
Terry Anderson.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., a member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, attended the ceremony, as did Reps. Cliff
Stearns, R-Fla.; Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., and Thomas Foglietta,
D-Pa. Also in attendance were Lebanese Ambassador Abdallah Bouhabib
and Peter Burleigh, deputy assistant secretary of state for Near
East affairs.
   On Wednesday, Moynihan said he would not accept ``the explanation
that nothing can be done.'' He was to introduce a resolution today
in the Senate condemning hostage-taking. ``Something must be done,
the executive branch must seek to use every avenue, formal and
informal, to win the hostages freedom,'' Moynihan said in a
statement.
   Meantime, administration officials say there has been no change
in the hostage policy since President Bush assumed office nearly two
months ago.
   ``In terms of our policy, there has been no change, and I don't
foresee one,'' said a State Department Mideast specialist, speaking
on condition of anonymity. He called the policy the only one that
might work.
   Since the Reagan administration was embarrassed in November 1986
by revelations it had sold weapons to Iran, the U.S. policy has
been, ``No concessions, but we're willing to talk to anyone,''
another official said.
   But Say has been critical of U.S. government efforts on behalf of
the hostages.
   ``You want to hope they are working on it, but let's face it,
four years speaks for itself,'' she said. Say said she does not
think the Bush administration has made any new drives to free the
hostages. ``Basically, things are just status quo.''
   She listed specific initiatives the United States could pursue,
including payments to the families of Iranians killed last July when
the USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf.
The State Department said it is working on a payment plan.
   ``You begin to wonder what it takes to move people,'' Mrs. Say
said. ``They have heard and read how hostages have died, how they
have gone mad, how they exist from day-to-day in the most barbaric
conditions and the world does not respond.''
   Officials say different factions hold the nine American hostages
who have been seized in Lebanon, but they are elements of the
umbrella group, Hezbollah, over which Iran exhibits control. The
United States has called for the unconditional release of all
hostages before it will talk with Iran.
   The families' frustration follows a brief sense of optimism that
followed Bush's Jan. 20 inaugural address in which he repeated his
opposition to any deals, but seemed to send a signal to the captors.
   ``There are today Americans who are held against their will in
foreign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for,'' Bush said.
``Assistance can be show here, and will be long remembered. Good
will begets good will.''
   Since then, other developments have intervened, most recently the
furor over ``The Satanic Verses,'' a book by Salman Rushdie that
Moslems consider to be blasphemous. The Iranian government has
called for Rushdie's death.
   ``The situation has fallen apart again,'' Mrs. Say said.
   Mammod Faksh, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the
University of Southern Maine, said he doesn't expect any good news
for the hostages soon.
   ``The Lebanese civil war is still ongoing and there is more
factionalism in Lebanon now than ever,'' he said. ``So many things
don't bode well for the hostages. They are still alive because it is
in the best interest of the hostage-takers to keep them alive.''
   At the State Department, Michael Mahoney is the designated
contact with the family members. He said he tries to call the
families every two weeks to reassure them ``someone is paying
attention to them,'' and to put current events in their proper
context.
   Mahoney also monitors the dozens of letters the department
receives each month from Americans on the hostages. In the 18 months
he has worked at the job, Mahoney said he has not noticed any change
in the volume.

<HEAD>IRS Says Budget Crunch Won't Slow Return Processing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service, under heavy fire
for often answering taxpayers' questions incorrectly, will not slow
its processing of tax refunds despite scattered personnel and supply
shortages caused by the budget crunch, acting Commissioner Michael
Murphy said Thursday.
   ``We have a management problem trying to conserve resources. ...
We are looking for about $50 million'' to continue present levels of
operations for the next six months, Murphy told the House Ways and
Means oversight subcommittee. But the IRS will not let the problem
slow returns processing, reduce services to taxpayers or deter the
agency's enforcement efforts, he vowed.
   On another problem, Murphy appeared to confirm reports that the
IRS has had a policy of sometimes not telling taxpayers when they
neglect to take credit for taxes withheld from their paychecks. That
would result in an overpayment of taxes.
   Until last December, Murphy told Rep. Harold Ford, D-Tenn., some
credits ``were not picked up'' at one stage of the agency's review
of tax returns and ``it is possible that taxpayers did not get the
refund they were entitled to.''
   Although changes in those procedures were made last year, Murphy
added, ``I still am not completely satisfied with that program.'' He
said he has asked for a report from other IRS officials.
   The existence of such a policy was asserted by IRS employees in
Memphis in interviews with Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and The
Associated Press.
   One employee, speaking only on the condition she not be named,
said an agency handbook prohibited telling a taxpayer that he or she
had neglected to subtract taxes withheld from taxes owed. In most
such cases, she said, taxpayers were overcharged by $100 to $1,000,
and often these cases involved retirees' pensions.
   When IRS headquarters in Washington was asked about the policy,
she said, ``We were told the taxpayers had to find their own
mistakes.''
   There were so many complaints from IRS workers about the policy
that it was modified last year to permit notification of taxpayers
who failed to subtract taxes withheld from wages or from periodic
pension payments, the employee said. But the old policy remains in
effect in cases of lump-sum pension payments.
   The Memphis worker is involved in an IRS program to identify
taxpayers who failed to report some or all of their income. She and
others in the program start checking returns about 15 months after
they are filed. If they find underreporting, they send the taxpayer
a form letter asking for an explanation.
   After Murphy testified Thursday, his principal spokesman, Ellen
Murphy, said the agency's policy is ``to make sure that people who
are entitled to refunds get them.''
   Murphy spent a good deal of his time before the House panel
apologizing that IRS employees in some areas of the nation are
correctly answering taxpayers' telephoned questions barely half the
time.
   ``Our accuracy rate is unacceptable,'' he said. ``We will not be
satisfied until we see substantial improvement.''
   Although the IRS and the General Accounting Office disagree on
just how often telephone ``assistors'' are wrong, the precise figure
didn't seem to matter to members of the subcommittee.
   ``You're talking about whether we should give you a `D' or a
`D-minus,''' said Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, the chairman. ``Calling
the IRS for tax advice is a real crapshoot.''
   The IRS and the GAO have been exchanging words since March 10,
when the IRS called a news conference to announce that its 5,000
employees who answer taxpayers' telephoned questions were giving
correct answers about 71 percent of the time.
   The GAO said the correct figure for the nation was closer to 62
percent and said the IRS had labeled some misleading answers as
correct.
   Murphy apologized for the IRS interpretation. But ironically, the
GAO Thursday announced that an updated, although more limited, test
indicated that IRS employees were correct about 66 percent of the
time.
   Murphy acknowledged that the IRS and its 115,000 employees, who
collect about $1 trillion a year in taxes, are having trouble living
within their $5.2 billion budget. The Washington Post quoted
unidentified sources Thursday as saying the agency ``is in the
throes of a full-fledged cash crisis.''
   Much of the trouble can be traced to the fact that Congress gave
the IRS $100 million less this year than it asked for and then
required the agency to cut other programs to finance a pay raise for
workers. The IRS saw the trouble coming late last year and asked the
White House to request additional money, but the White House refused.

   ``I figure a year of running full time is adequate,'' Young said
Wednesday.
   The only announced candidate is four-term Lt. Gov. Zell Miller,
who like Young is a Democrat.
   Young, a 57-year-old former congressman and United Nations

said.
   Security guards discovered the attack on the herd of eight South
African springbok antelope at about 6 a.m., Zoo Director Charlie
Hoessle said. He said a guard shot and killed one of the dogs in the
compound and three others were chased from the area and later killed.
   Hoessle said one male springbok survived the attack.

   Some of the best engineering students in New
England are busy trying to build cars that will take them 200 miles
over four days.
   That won't be so easy as it sounds, because the cars will have to
be powered only by the sun. The Montpelier, Vt.-to-Cambridge, Mass.,
race, called the American Tour de Sol, is set for May 25-28.
   The race is patterned after a competition in Switzerland that has
attracted hundreds of entries since it began in 1985, including
several from the schools involved in the New England race this year.
   ``There's a very high interest level,'' said Dartmouth Professor
Robert Wills, who is coordinating the race. ``At Dartmouth, the
solar car project has attracted the most interest of any engineering
project that I've seen.''
   The winning team will get a trip to the European race, also
called the Tour de Sol, this summer.
   Solar-powered cars use photovoltaic cells to collect energy from
sunlight that power their electric motors. The cars can reach speeds
of more than 60 mph.
   Doug Fraser, coordinator of the Dartmouth team, said it is
redesigning parts of the car that entered last year's European race
but was disqualified because of a technical problem in the drive
system. Changes will include a new drive system and a new computer.
   ``We did pretty well, considering we were using a back-up drive
system,'' Fraser said.
   The other four schools participating are New Hampshire Technical
Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of
Lowell and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
   ``I don't know of any single activity on campus that has created
as much enthusiasm as the solar car project,'' said David Larrabee,
president of New Hampshire Tech.
   Wills said the race will be run along back roads and will take
the competitors through each of the five campuses. The times for the
four daily legs of the race will be compared to calculate the winner.
   ``We managed to hit all the campuses, and that's a big selling
point for us,'' he said. ``Everyone on the campuses will be able to
see the cars.''
   Though the Tour de Sol cars are designed with the hope that one
could someday be used commercially, for now their cost is too high.
Fraser said the Dartmouth car, for example, cost about $80,000.
   Wills said students get their schools or companies to sponsor the
cars, but the cost is worth it because students learn about many
engineering problems.
   ``Even the professors learn a lot,'' he said.

   The county jail boiled with rage after a
deputy warden and two guards were charged with beating to death an
inmate, and the men were held today in a closed municipal jail for
their safety.
   Inmates of the Hudson County Jail shouted from their cells and
smashed windows, and one set a bedsheet on fire outside a window as
about 75 relatives and friends of the victim, Arnaldo Ortega,
rallied outside on Wednesday.
   Bedsheets and toilet paper flapped from the windows of some cells.
   ``People are out here to pay their respects,'' said John Jones,
25, a protester. ``And we're here for justice. Everybody makes
mistakes, but they made a big one. That boy had a family and now
he's in his grave.''
   At least six police officers stood guard outside the jail during
the demonstration, and about 20 others watched the crowd. There were
no confrontations.
   Earlier in the day, corrections Officers Thomas Murphy, 39, and
David Michael Dumers, 35, and Deputy Warden Raymond Murray, 52, were
charged with murdering Ortega, who was in jail on a burglary charge.
   Hudson County Prosecutor Paul M. DePascale said Ortega, 28, was
beaten for 15 to 20 minutes in a jail elevator and left for 16 hours
in a basement holding cell before guards summoned medical help.
   He died Saturday at a hospital where he was brought two days
earlier in a coma. A coroner's report said he was beaten in the
head, arms and body. Ortega's brother, Angel, said inmates told his
family that guards used nightsticks on Ortega.
   The defendants were unable to raise $50,000 bail and were sent to
the Bayonne City Jail, which was ordered closed by the state a month
ago because it had no cameras to watch for suicide attempts.
Officials are deciding whether to install cameras.
   Superior Court Judge Kevin Callahan said he would not send the
three to the Hudson County Jail for fear of exposing them to attacks
from other inmates.
   The county board of freeholders, in response to protests over the
killing, said it would investigate allegations about the existence
of a ``goon squad'' of corrections workers who routinely beat
inmates.
   DePascale said there is a special unit that responds to crises
but that there was no evidence of unprovoked attacks. No other
criminal charges are planned, he said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan approved air-dropping
intelligence data and recoilless rifles to help the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels sink two ships carrying arms, Oliver North's
Iran-Contra trial was told today.
   The disclosure came during testimony by former national security
adviser Robert McFarlane, North's onetime boss at the National
Security Council.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan questioned McFarlane about a ``top
secret'' Oct. 3, 1985 memo from North to McFarlane in which North
recommended the U.S. government air-drop intelligence to the Contras.
   As McFarlane examined the memo on the witness stand, Sullivan
said McFarlane's deputy, John Poindexter, approved the
recommendation and that Poindexter added the words: ``President
approved.''
   The approval came at a time when the Boland Amendment prohibited
any U.S. government agency involved in intelligence activities from
using money to assist the Contras.
   According to Sullivan's description of the memo, the steps North
recommended were ``not only extraordinary, but also expensive'' and
followed a meeting on the matter by the Restricted Agency Group.
McFarlane described that as an interagency committee that made
``recommendations on Nicaragua,'' with one deputy from each of
several departments involved in intelligence.
   The last page of North's memo describes ``what to tell the
president,'' said Sullivan, who read portions of it aloud.
   One portion the lawyer read said that ``we intend to air drop
intelligence along with two recoilless rifles which will be used to
sink one or both of the arms carriers.''
   McFarlane said the recoilless rifles are ``designed to knock out
a very hard target'' such as a tank, a bunker or a plane on the
ground.''
   ``Or sink a ship as it says here,'' added Sullivan.
   McFarlane said the memo didn't come to him, since Poindexter
dealt with it.
   Poindexter, who succeeded McFarlane as President Reagan's
national security adviser, was in another courtroom today for
housekeeping matters concerning his case on charges that resemble
North's.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson said he hoped that
Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial can get under way in summer or early
fall, after North's trial ends, and that he has not decided whether
he or another judge will preside.
   The case had been in Gesell's court, but the judge decided he
didn't want to hear it. In the meantime, Robinson said, he will take
care of any pre-trial matters.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh told the judge he does not
know yet whether the government will follow its action in the North
case and drop two key charges _ conspiracy, and theft of government
property _ that had been lodged against Poindexter.
   McFarlane testified Wednesday at North's trial that inducements
worth $110 million were discussed orally with Honduras' president
but not given to him in writing.
   The Honduran deal and other third-country help to the Contras
were kept secret because the countries' relations with Congress
would be ``damaged'' if the support was disclosed, said McFarlane.
Also, exposure would touch off a confrontation with Congress, he
said.
   Four of the charges against North are that he lied to Congress in
1985 by denying that he was involved in assisting the Contras.
   A Sept. 13, 1984, memo from North to McFarlane detailed how an
assistant secretary of state told congressional intelligence
committees that foreign countries were providing support to the
Contras but that the State Department official didn't know which
ones.
   McFarlane acknowledged he took no steps to inform Congress of
what he, Reagan and others in the administration knew at the time,
that Saudi Arabia was providing $1 million a month for the Contras.
   The secret payments to Honduras amounted to $35 million in
speeded-up deliveries of rifles, ammunition, machine guns and other
military aid, plus $75 million in economic assistance. In addition,
there is other unspecified assistance that is classified and which
has not been disclosed at the trial.
   Reagan initialed his approval of the Honduran plan on a memo
dated Feb. 18, 1985.
   ``You're going to give them tens of millions of dollars to
cooperate?'' North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked McFarlane.
   ``Yes.''
   ``There is nothing dirty about quid pro quo, is there?''
   ``No.''
   The Honduran arrangement was made near the beginning of a
two-year span in which the so-called the Boland Amendment prohibited
U.S. military aid to the guerrillas.

<HEAD>FAA Raises Fines for Guns in Hand-Carried Luggage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passenger who tries to take a gun through an
airport screening point, even unwittingly, could be fined at least
$1,000 under a newly toughened Federal Aviation Administration
policy, a spokesman said Thursday.
   If the weapon is loaded or there is an attempt to conceal it,
fines could range up to $10,000, said spokesman Fred Farrar.
   Previously, FAA regional authorities could pursue smaller fines
against first-time offenders or issue warnings, Farrar said.
   Under the new order, a penalty of $1,000 would be sought in civil
court if the firearm was unloaded and ammunition was not accessible
to the passenger. This would be increased to $2,000 if ammunition
was found.
   The fine could be $2,500 for a loaded firearm and from $5,000 to
$10,000 if there was an attempt to conceal even an unloaded weapon.
If a gun was used along with a threat, the civil penalty could be at
least $10,000 in addition to any punishment that might result from
criminal prosecution.
   The FAA said 2,773 firearms were detected in airports last year,
leading to 1,493 arrests. Farrar said he could not immediately
determine how many of the cases had led to successful prosecutions
or the size of fines imposed.
   The agency said more than 70 percent of the guns were loaded. A
survey showed that 26 guns discharged in luggage between 1975 and
1986, including one that killed an airline employee.
   The FAA said the only legal way to transport a gun aboard an
aircraft is in checked luggage, and if it's a handgun the luggage
must be locked with the only key in the owner's possession. The
weapon must be unloaded, and the owner must declare it to the
airline when the luggage is checked.

   Council members hoping to keep
undesirables off their wealthy island are considering installing
closed circuit cameras to monitor bridges and the main highway into
town.
   Town Manager Robert Doney said the cameras would enable
authorities to film ``vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists ... anyone
coming to Palm Beach to do anything of an illegal nature.'' He said
he thought the cameras could have ``a very good psychological effect
on deterring crime.''
   Town Attorney John Randolph said the constitutionality of the
proposal, submitted Tuesday by a resident, should be studied before
the council votes on it, and council members asked the town's Public
Safety Committee to study the matter.
   Council President Nancy Douthit said the idea was ``definitely
worth the research.''
   ``The only people who might be bothered by this are those with a
guilty conscience,'' Douthit said. ``You are photographed any time
you go into a bank, any time you go through a toll booth on the
turnpike and in many retail establishments and condo buildings. I
don't see this as being any different.''
   The proposal would place cameras on four bridges and on the
town's approach on Highway A1A from South Palm Beach.

<HEAD>Smoking Bans In Jail Proposed In Two More Counties In Michigan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Future inmates at the Muskegon and Ottawa
county jails may have to give up more than their freedom to pay
their debts to society. They may also lose their cigarettes.
   ``People in jail give up quite a bit,'' said Patricia Rehfield,
medical director in Ottawa County, where a committee has recommended
a cigarette ban in the jail and other county buildings. ``Smoking
certainly can be part of that.''
   In Muskegon County, the sheriff's department has proposed that
the county council make the entire department and jail smoke free
May 1, said Capt. Robert Baker, jail administrator.
   ``It is not going to be easy for anyone,'' Baker said, estimating
that more than half the inmates smoke.
   The Ottawa and Muskegon county proposals are inspired in part by
an experimental ban begun six weeks ago at the Grand Traverse County
jail. Officials in the two counties are monitoring that program
before deciding whether to approve their own.
   Some officials are concerned a smoking ban could trigger more
tension in the overcrowded jail system.
   ``We are thinking about issuing hard candy with dinner,'' Baker
said. ``We might also put a popcorn machine in for the evenings.
That might take the edge off of it.'' Muskegon officials also plan
to offer stop-smoking classes to inmates and employees.

   About 100 students at Colby-Sawyer
College sat in Thursday at the administration building, singing ``I
Am Woman,'' to protest the possible admission of men.
   The protest gave way after about four hours to an emotional
meeting between the students, nearly one-quarter of the school's
roughly 450 enrollment, and two administrators.
   ``This institution runs because of our money. We should be put on
the task force'' studying coeducation, one student told President
Peggy Stock and Trustee Chairman Peter Danforth at the meeting. ``We
deserve that.''
   In addition, the students asked Stock to scrap separate meetings
scheduled with staff, administrators and students in favor of a
campuswide meeting, and to delay by a month the April 1 trustees'
vote on admitting men.
   Students complained that coeducation has been discussed, partly
in response to the prospect of a dwindling applicant pool, since
October, but that students learned of it only recently. Students,
one told Stock, feel ``segregated and manipulated.''
   Stock and Danforth responded that the administration has not
meant to keep anyone in the dark.
   ``There's been no effort at all to divide and conquer. Rather,
just the opposite _ to let everyone know at the time we know,''
Danforth said.
   The liberal arts school has been all-women for more than 60
years. The school traces its roots to a small academy chartered in
1837.

<HEAD>This May be the Year for Acid-Rain Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress, spurred on by President Bush's
promise to do something this year about acid rain, is beginning what
could be the final confrontation in an eight-year, multi-million
dollar lobbying war over clean air.
   The opening volley was fired Thursday when more than 100 House
members, most allied with environmental groups, introduced
legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40
percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that amount. The
gases are the two major components of acid rain.
   The bill drew expected, strong support from environmental groups,
but was quickly opposed by the coal, auto and electric utilities
industries, which have fought environmentalists to an expensive draw
since the Reagan administration took office in 1981.
   ``This is the year for clean air,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn., a sponsor of the legislation along with Reps. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., and Silvio Conte, R-Mass. He cited the ``new attitude'' of
President Bush compared to that of former President Reagan, and
``increased public awareness and concern about our environment.''
   Environmental groups cite Bush's promise to solve the acid rain
problem, made during a trip to Canada last month, as one of two
political developments that signal the battle may be near an end.
The other is the levation to majority leader of Sen. George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine, who sponsored last year's clean-air legislation
in that chamber.
   ``For industry, I think they know the `no-bill' option is pretty
well off the table,'' said Alexandra Allen, attorney for the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, a private environmental lobbying
organization.
   Ron Sykes, senior Washington represenative of General Motors
Corp., acknowledged, ``The pressures for doing something this year
are considerably more than they were last year.''
   But Sykes said ``we seem to be charging down a path that is
driven by what we've learned in the early years'' about acid rain,
and ``not what we're about to learn'' from a 10-year federal study
scheduled for completion in mid-1990.
   He suggested the nation wait for the study, a recommendation that
Reagan supported but Bush rejected in Canada.
   Gayla Hoffman, a spokeswoman for the nation's largest coal
producer, Peabody Holding Co. of St. Louis, said her company ``is
opposed to additional controls beyond those already in place in the
Clean Air Act.''
   And Diane Smiroldo, a spokeswoman for Edison Electric Institute,
representing the nation's electric utilities, said that ``the
current Clean Air Act is working'' and that ``any legislation at
this point is premature.''
   Acid rain and another aspect of the clean air debate _ dirty air
caused by ozone and carbon monoxide _ have been among the most
heavily lobbied issues in Congress.
   According to records on file in the House and Senate, Citizens
for Sensible Control of Acid Rain was the top lobbying spender in
1986. The organization, bankrolled principally by electric utilities
and coal companies, spent $3,028,235 on behalf of a grassroots
direct mail campaign opposing legislation mandating stricter acid
rain emissions. Acid rain legislation did not get near the floor
that year.
   But that figure did not include spending by individual
automakers, lectric utilities and chemical and coal companies and
their trade associations, according to Ms. Allen. She said
environmental lobbying groups spent only a fraction of industry
expenditures.
   The industry groups also have had strong allies in Congress: the
House Energy and Commerce chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and
the former Senate majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The House bill would require that sulfur dioxide emissions be
reduced by 10 million tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 4 million
tons by 1998. Currently, an estimated 22 million tons of sulfur
dioxide and 21 million tons of nitrogen oxide are being emitted into
the air.
   The two gases are converted in the atmosphere into acids, which
travel far from their starting points to pollute lakes and forests
and, according to some health experts, cause serious respiratory
problems for asthmatics, children and the elderly.
   The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning electric
power plants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emitted
in approximately equal amounts by motor vehicles and industry.
   Congress has been divided along regional lines. The Northeast,
the primary victim of acid rain, wants immediate action. Midwestern
states, with many older, coal-fired power plants, fear controls that
will boost electric bills.
   States that produce large amonts of high-sulfur coal _ Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania _ worry that controls
will cause massive job losses in the coal industry.
   The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is not a
serious problem, is reluctant to pay the cost for new controls.
   Under the new House bill:
   _Electric utilities would receive federal subsidies to protect
residential customers from rate hikes of more than 10 percent as a
result of the sulfur dioxide controls.
   _Motor vehicle manufacturers would be required to tighten
tailpipe standards for nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons.
   _The EPA would be required to control hydrocarbon vapors by
requiring onboard vehicle canisters or controls at the gas pump.
Sykes said the canisters are unsafe, and could cause fires in
crashes, in hot weather, and if a leak develops in the emissions
system.

<HEAD>Kissinger Aide Approved Despite Helms' Criticism</HEAD>

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
unanimously today to approve the nomination of Lawrence Eagleburger
as the No. 2 man at the State Department, ending a controversy over
his ties to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's
international consulting firm.
   The 19-0 vote came after Eagleburger, who earned more than
$900,000 last year as president of Kissinger Associates, agreed to
voluntarily disqualify himself from all matters involving former
clients of the firm during his government service.
   But Eagleburger was not been required to divulge the names of
those clients to the committee, a move sought by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C. Several senators pointed out that such a request put the
nominee in the position of making disclosures beyond those required
under the Ethics in Government Act.
   The nomination now goes to the full Senate, which is expected to
approve Eagleburger as undersecretary of state on Friday.
   The vote came after Helms grilled Eagleburger about his ties to
Kissinger's firm.
   ``Henry Kissinger was ... a political entity. He still is. That's
why Larry Eagleburger got well over a million dollars,'' the senator
said.
   Helms brought up the difficulties encountered by former Sen. John
Tower in his recent failed attempt to become defense secretary due
in part to his financial ties to defense contractors.
   ``I wish he had an opportunity to answer questions in public
about his income,'' Helms said. ``He wasn't allowed to defend
himself'' against many of the allegations.
   Helms, a staunch conservative, also has been critical for years
of Kissinger's conduct of foreign policy, especially moves toward
closer relations with the Soviet Union during the Nixon and Ford
administrations.
   Helms has asked Eagleburger, a longtime Kissinger ade, to turn
over a confidential list of all of the clients of Kissinger
Associates, even though Eagleburger may not have worked for all of
the clients during his four years with the New York-based consulting
firm.
   Eagleburger and his attorney, William Rogers, told the committee
that if pressed they would comply with the request but believed it
set a poor precedent.
   ``Mr. Eagleburger and Kissinger are prepared to comply,'' said
Rodgers. ``But it's an open door the committee could push through if
they like.''
   Rodgers contended that such a broad request would make it
difficult for any person who had served in the private sector to
enter government service.
   The attorney pointed out that Eagleburger has cut all ties with
Kissinger Associates, sold all his stock and offered to disqualify
himself for a period of one year from any dealings involving any of
the clients he served while with the firm.
   Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Joseph Biden, D-Del., objected
to Helms' line of questioning.
   ``You can't design something that will fit all situations,'' Mrs.
Kassebaum said, pointing out that the State Department is unlike the
Defense Department.
   ``We have to keep in mind common sense and good judgment,'' she
said, speaking of problems of conflict of interest.
   Eagleburger who has filed financial disclosure forms showing he
made $915,000 last year while working as the president of the firm,
testified Wednesday that he has cut all ties with the firm and an
affiliate, Kent Associates. Eagleburger also said he had sold all
his investment stocks.
   Eagleburger received numerous plaudits for his years at the State
Department, including service as ambassador to Yugoslavia and
undersecretary of State. But most questions centered on his contacts
with the international clients of Kissinger's firm.
   ``I'd rather be safe than sorry ... and right now, I don't know
what the facts are,'' Helms argued in asking for the list of
clients. The senator promised the list would be held in confidence,
saying, ``I don't think anybody on this committee would leak one
word of this.''
   If the Senate does not act this week, the nomination could be
delayed for several weeks, because members leave Friday for a
two-week Easter recess.
   Several senators on the panel called for timely action on the
nomination, given the dearth of confirmed officials in the upper
levels of the Bush administration.
   Eagleburger testified that he had provided the committee with a
list of the clients he had personally dealt while with at the firm
and a description of his work for them in a ``generic sense.'' But
he said he was prevented from disclosing additional information
under the firm's confidentiality contract with its clients.
   The firms include such concerns as Anheuser-Busch, the South
Korean conglomerate Daewoo Corp., H.J. Heinz, and the Italian car
maker Fiat S.p.a., ITT Corp., A.B. Volvo, Union Carbide, Coca-Cola
and Midland Bank.
   He also testified that under advice from the Office of Government
Ethics, he would disqualify himself for a period of one year from
any future matters at the State Department involving the clients he
worked with while with the firms.
   ``There will be no conflicts of interest because I have no
outside interests,'' Eagleburger said.
   He also argued that his step to disqualify himself for the
one-year period on all matters involving former clients was
voluntary and went beyond the requirements of the Ethics in
Government Act, which he said only required a recusal case-by-case.
   But given the current climate on Capitol Hill in the wake of the
intense scrutiny of Tower over his failed nomination to head the
Defense Department of Defense, Eagleburger was queried during his
initial hearing about everything from his 30 years in government
service to his personal habits.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., apparently in jest, even asked
Eagleburger at one point, ``Have you ever, in public or private,
pinched a woman's behind?''
   The room erupted in nervous laughter, with Eagleburger responding
in the negative.

   Israeli teen-agers are playing a form of Russian
roulette that involves dodging speeding cars in an apparent attempt
to share the dangers faced by Israeli soldiers, an official said
Thursday.
   The game, which has swept the country in epidemic form, appears
in different versions nationwide, said Shai Gadish, head of the
Education Ministry's Road Safety Unit.
   Teen-agers either lie in the path of an approaching car and wait
until the last moment to scamper away or leave school bags in the
middle of the road, darting out to snatch them from oncoming cars,
Gadish said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   The Education and Transportation ministries have sent
psychologists to high schools in an attempt to discover why the
dangerous game is so popular, he said.
   Gadish said teen-agers hear about the brave deeds of older
friends and brothers in the army. ``They want to imitate them by
exhibiting their own courage ... by endangering their own lives,''
he said.
   Israelis are drafted into the army on their 18th birthday. Men
serve for three years and women for two.
   ``We live in a society where you need to show courage,'' Gadish
said. ``These youths know it's dangerous in the streets and that
they can show their bravery there.''
   Only one youth has been slightly injured playing the game,
Transportation Ministry officials said.
   Gadish said teens usually play the game on their way home from
school, and high school principals have asked parents to discourage
their children from participating.
   ``We are worried that the more publicity this game of Russian
roulette in the streets receives, the more popular it will become,''
said Atniel Schneller, of the Transportation Ministry.

<HEAD>US Agencies Say Apples Safe for Kids</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three federal agencies proclaimed today that
apples are safe for children to eat, attempting to calm fears about
a chemical used by some growers that has been linked to cancer and
claims that preschoolers are especially vulnerable.
   ``The federal government believes that it is safe for Americans
to eat apples,'' said a joint statement by the Environmental
Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration and Agriculture
Department.
   The agencies said there is no ``imminent hazard posed to
children'' by the consumption of apples.
   At a Senate hearing, FDA Administrator Frank Young noted that he
moved swiftly to raise concerns about fruit imported from Chile
after traces of cyanide were found in two grapes. He declared he
would do the same if he thought apples were dangerous for children.
   There has been growing concern among parents and school officials
about whether children should continue eating apples and apple
products until questions about the health questions.
   At the center of the controversy is the chemical daminozide, sold
under the trade name Alar, which the EPA said has caused cancer in
test animals. Last month a private environmental group issued a
report suggesting that children are especially at risk from Alar
because they consumer many times more apples and apple products,
compared to their weight, than adults.
   School systems in a number of cities including New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles have stopped providing children apples after the
report by the Natural Resources Defense Council was made public and
the CBS program ``60 Minutes'' reported on the controversy.
   In a statement, the three federal agencies said: ``The federal
government encourages school systems and other responsible for the
diets of children to continue to serve apples and other nutritious
fruit to American children.''
   Young said the reaction to claims that young children are exposed
to a dangerous levels of Alar in apples has caused a ``panic'' that
is not warranted. He said there is ``not a signficant risk at this
time facing the American people in the consumption of apples.''
   John Moore, acting deputy EPA administrator, told the Senate
subcommittee on children, families, drugs and alcoholism that while
the EPA has conclude that daminozide causes cancer, its continued
use does not pose a threat that would warrant the chemical being
ordered immediately off the market.
   Moore in his testimony criticized the NRDC study's risk estimates
as not being ``scientifically sound'' and said the report has caused
``misinformation and fear'' to dominate the debate. Nevertheless,
Moore said if daminozide were a newly introduced pesticide it would
not be approved.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., suggested that the manufacturer of
Alar ``would do us all a public service if they suspended production
of the product'' because the controversy is harming the apple
industry.
   Adams said most growers in Washington state do not use
daminozide, but there was no agreement among witnesses as to how
widespread the use of the chemical actually is.
   Young said the FDA has concluded that about 10 percent of the
apples are sprayed with Alar, but the EPA has cited a figure of
about 5 percent. Consumer groups have claimed that spot checks have
shown a use as high as 30 percent.
   Several senators said the controversy is threatening the apple
industry. ``The apple market is dead as a doornail right now across
America,'' said Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, whose family owns an
apple orchard.

   A police officer who was acquitted last summer
of sexually abusing a 6-year-old girl was charged Thursday with
raping the same child, after police allegedly found a tape of the
crime in his apartment.
   Patrolman Warren A. Poole, 45, was acquitted in June when the
girl, placed on the witness stand in front of the defendant,
recanted her story of abuse.
   Several months later, however, the girl told police that Poole
had molested her again. After obtaining a search warrant, police
raided Poole's apartment Wednesday and confiscated a videotape that
prosecutors said shows the policeman having sex with the girl.
   Poole, who was suspended without pay after the raid, pleaded
innocent at arraignment in Lynn District Court.
   Judge Joseph Dever set bail at $350,000 with double surety,
meaning Poole must put up bonds worth at least $700,000 to secure
his release.
   Poole's attorney, Alan Karahalis, did not respond to telephone
messages requesting comment.
   Poole, a divorced father of six children, has served for 14 years
on the police force in Lynn, a industrial city of 78,500 people
about 15 miles north of Boston.
   During his trial last summer, the child talked about visits to
Poole's apartment on weekends but did not accuse him of any sexual
misconduct.
   Stephen O'Connell, a spokesman for Essex County District Attorney
Kevin Burke, said the girl had previously given investigators a
detailed account of abuse but ``froze up'' on the witness stand.
   Following his acquittal, Poole was reinstated to the police
department with back pay.

   A judge placing a shoplifter on five years
of probation also ordered her to introduce herself to merchants and
receive permission before shopping in their stores.
   Nosrat Smith, 51, of Norfolk faced up to a year in prison as a
repeat offender. But during sentencing Monday, Madison County Judge
Phillip Riley said there is evidence Mrs. Smith had been diagnosed
as suffering from kleptomania, a persistant impulse to steal.
   In asking the court for probation, Mrs. Smith's attorney, Ross
Stoffer of Norfolk, said, ``It's a situation where she has no
control. This is not a lady who is personally dishonest.''
   Deputy County Attorney Joseph Smith argued for a one-year
sentence, saying previous probation sentences had not kept Mrs.
Smith from repeat offenses.
   As conditions of probation this time, Riley ordered that Mrs.
Smith continue receiving therapy for kleptomania, introduce herself
to local merchants, shop with an adult escort, list any stores she
may have taken items from during the past two years, make
restitution to those stores, complete 200 hours of community service
work, continue to improve her English-speaking abilities and take a
lie detector test every six months.

   A surfer bitten by a shark at a public beach has
lost a lawsuit against the county in which he charged that as in the
movie ``Jaws'' authorities failed to warn bathers because of a
holiday weekend.
   A jury deliberated 77 minutes Wednesday before rejecting a
$63,000 claim by Jonathan Popper against Dade County over a leg
injury he received in the May 21, 1983, attack.
   Popper, 22 when he was bitten, had argued that sharks were
sighted off Haulover Beach in the days prior to his attack, but no
warning was issued, even though lifeguards commonly post signs
advising of dangerous currents and poisonous jellyfish.
   ``Why would Dade County make the decision to expose people to
sharks rather than expose sharks to people?'' Popper's attorney Jay
Rothlein said in his summary. ``There can be only one reason _ there
was a holiday weekend coming up and sharks are bad for buisiness.''
   Assistant county attorney Ron Bernstein called those arguments
absurd.
   ``As this trial went on, it became apparent these men were trying
to orchestrate the sequel to ``Jaws,'' Bernstein said.
   In the Peter Benchley novel ``Jaws'' and the movie made from it,
the mayor of a fictional beach town fails to heed warnings about
shark dangers for fear it will hurt businesses awaiting a holiday
weekend crowd.
   Bernstein also noted that Popper had been surfing in the area for
10 years prior to the attack and was back surfing in the same spot
six months later.

   President Bush today challenged charges that his
administration is adrift, saying he is trying to defuse ``ticking
time bombs'' while charting an agenda for America in the next
century.
   ``In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye _ or
makes the headlines,'' Bush said.
   In a state where savings and loan failures have become regular
events, Bush prodded Congress to move quickly on his three-week-old
plan to save the beleagured industry. ``There's no excuse for
further delay,'' he said.
   ``The essential question today is, `What are we doing to prepare
for the new world that begins 11 short years from now?'' he said.
``That's what my agenda is all about.''
   In his first trip West since his inauguration Jan. 20, the
president flew to Texas and Colorado for a pair of speeches.
   His first stop was in Houston for a luncheon appearance before
the Forum Club, which bills itself as a nonpartisan educational
institution. Next, he was flying to Colorado Springs, Colo., to
address the Junior Achievement National Business Leadership
Conference.
   In the Houston appearance, Bush ticked off a series of
initiatives from his new administration: a spending and
deficit-reduction plan, a program to relieve Third World debt, a
proposal to rescue the savings and loan industry and an increase in
the minimum wage.
   On the savings and loan crisis, Bush again assured depositors
that their savings are safe. ``They are fully protected and will
continue to be fully protected,'' he said. In recent months, S&amp;L
customers have been withdrawing deposits at a record rate.
   Bush said the S&amp;L industry must be cleaned up ``so that the
questionable ractices and outright illegalities that caused the
current crisis won't happen again.''
   Moreover, he said, ``We must see to it that those S&amp;L officials
guilty of criminal actions are pursued and punished for the losses
they have caused.''
   ``These are serious challenges _ ticking time bombs that we need
to defuse without delay,'' he said. ``And we're doing just that.
   ``But these are by no means the only issues that demand
leadership and prompt action. We're entering the 1990s _ a horizon
decade, threshold to a new century.''
   He said that ``building a better America means laying the
foundations today for the kind of future we want.''
   Along those lines, Bush said, the United States needs to take
steps to safeguard the environment against short-sighted actions
that do long-term damage.
   ``It means finding ways to preserve and strengthen indispensable
institutions like the family in the midst of social change,'' he
said. ``It means taking a long-range look at the international
landscape to determine what policies and approaches will keep us
free, prosperous and at peace in the 21st century, as we are today.
   ``And speaking of freedom, it means formulating a multi-source
energy policy that, in the long run, will make us less dependent on
foreign oil,'' the president, a former Texas oilman, said in this
petroleum-oriented city.
   Bush said the nation must invest in its own economy with new
incentives for business, including catalysts for research and
development. He called anew for a reduction in the capital gains tax.
   In addition, Bush said the nation must encourage and improve
education.
   ``We aren't going to clean up the environment, turn our education
system around or create a more responsive business climate in a
single day,'' he said. ``But if we begin today and make steady
progress, we will succeed.
   ``In this kind of work,'' he said, ``more is going on than meets
the eye, or makes the headlines. The proof will come when we look
back from the year 2000.''
   In his speech, Bush was warmly applauded by the audience of more
than 1,000 people when he raised the controversial subject of
restrictions on military-style assault weapons.
   ``I do want to find the solution to the so-called AK-47 assault
weapon problem, one that protects the rights of the legitimate
sportsman but also protects the lives of our police officers, who
are laying their lives on the line,'' he said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that
Bush applauded the decision of Colt Industries to suspend sales of
its popular AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. Asked if other industries
should follow suit, Fitzwater said the administration would stand
pat for now.
   In recent speeches, the president has been emphasizing his
actions thus far, including proposals for rescuing the savings and
loan industry, relieving Third World debt, cutting the deficit and
combating the problems of drugs, the environment and child care.
   ``Let us recognize that we stand at a special moment in our
history,'' Bush said in a speech Wednesday night before the
Electronic Industries Association, an industry trade group.
   ``It is a moment not for complacency, not to sit back and reflect
upon what has been but to reflect upon what might be.''
   Bush said he has established four objectives: to reduce the
deficit, invest in the nation's future, confront problems that
cannot wait and avoid imposing new taxes.
   ``These four objectives will build on the progress of the last
eight years. They will build a better America,'' Bush said. ``They
will reaffirm our strengths, defuse ticking time bombs and reorient
us as a nation.''
   Today's speech came amid skepticism from Democrats that Congress
and the administration can reach a quick agreement on a new spending
plan. Neither side has been willing to propose either new taxes or
new spending cuts to reduce the deficit.
   Bush said a recent poll of corporate leaders found they believe
Americans are too short-term oriented.
   ``My plan speaks to the long term, and to a stable business
climate,'' Bush said. ``It says that to remain competitive, we must
look beyond the next quarterly statement.''
   Bush used the occasion to underscore his request for a cut in the
capital gains tax to 15 percent, saying that ``nothing could make
America more competitive.''
   A congressional study released this week said that 80 percent of
the benefits from Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut would go to
Americans making more than $100,000 a year.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has increased its
military presence in the Persian Gulf since the Iran-Iraq
cease-fire, despite publicly urging withdrawal of foreign navies
from the region, a U.S. military official said Thursday.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in the gulf,
said the Soviet navy continues escorting that nation's tankers while
the United States and other navies have scaled back escort
operations.
   ``I see no withdrawal of the Soviets in this area,'' Schwarzkopf
told reporters. ``As a matter of fact ... I see an increase in their
diplomatic initiatives... and their military assistance
initiatives.''
   Schwarzkopf said there has been a gradual reduction of U.S.
forces in the gulf since an Aug. 20 cease-fire halted fighting in
the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
   The U.S. naval force in the gulf and the Arabian Sea now consists
of 23 ships and will soon be cut to 19, Pentagon officials said.
Schwarzkopf said the unit, which has operated in the gulf since
1949, would wind up slightly larger than the six ships in the region
before mid-1987 when forces were boosted to protect U.S. shipping
during the escalating war.
   Schwarzkopf said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who
visited Iraq and Iran on a recent regional tour, did not honestly
state the number of Soviet ships in the gulf.
   ``I will tell you, without going into details, that his
mathematics are very bad, compared to what we've seen here,''
Schwarzkopf said.
   U.S. military sources say the Soviets maintain seven to nine
ships in and near the gulf, including missile frigates and
destroyers. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there has been no significant change in the Soviet force since the
gulf war truce.
   ``The Soviets now have a permanent presence in the Arabian Gulf,
that they've never had before,'' Schwarzkopf said. ``They have a
very heavy presence of forces in the Red Sea, which, of course, Mr.
Schevardnadze didn't talk about.''
   He said the Soviets also had ``an overwhelming number of military
advisers and military men'' in South Yemen _ the only communist
regime in the Arab world _ in Ethiopia, Iraq and other countries,
and have ``a very large troop presence'' just north of the
Soviet-Iran border.

<HEAD>Court Sides With Jehovah's Witness Ban Against Transfusions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An adult's right to refuse medical
treatment in the face of death was upheld Thursday by the Florida
Supreme Court in a case involving a Jehovah's Witness who was forced
to accept blood transfusions.
   Privacy rights and religious freedom supersede the medical
profession's interest in saving lives, the justices ruled 6-1. The
court, noting the woman did not want to die, said its ruling was not
condoning suicide.
   The decision was a victory for Norma Wons, who sought care for
uterine bleeding in April 1986. Doctors said she was lapsing in and
out of consciousness and death was imminent at the time.
   While still conscious, she fought against receiving transfusions
because Jehovah's Witnesses believe it defies a biblical passage in
Leviticus, ``Whatsoever man ... eats any manner of blood, I will cut
him off from among his people.''
   A court in Miami ordered doctors at the county-run Jackson
Memorial Hospital to perform transfusions. Mrs. Wons regained
consciousness and continued her court battle.
   Her attorney, John D. Kelner, said the bleeding is likely to
recur.
   ``That is one of the things that made the issue not moot with the
court,'' said Kelner. ``She has expressed her preference in writing
that should she suffer from it again, she be allowed to ... refuse
transfusions.''
   Hospital officials, represented by the hospital's Public Health
Trust of Dade County, said letting Mrs. Wons die would leave her two
children without proper nurturing.
   Mrs. Wons, 41, argued that her husband supported her decision and
the children would be cared by him, his mother and brothers.
   The high court said Mrs. Wons' wasn't necessarily ignoring the
best interest of her children and shouldn't be viewed as returning
to a normal life after having been forced to commit a sin against
religious laws.
   Her death may have been necessary to ensure her spiritual life,
Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich wrote in a separate opinion agreeing
with the majority.
   ``As a parent, ... she also must consider the example she sets
for her children, how to teach them to follow what she believes is
God's law if she herself does not. The choice for her cannot be an
easy one, but it is hers to make,'' Ehrlich wrote.
   Justice Ben Overton, in the sole dissent, said Mrs. Wons' death
would have been unnecessary and guessed the court would have
surprised one of the framers of the U.S. Constitution.
   ``To justify, as a right of the free exercise of religion, a
parent's right to abandon a minor child through a death which is
totally unecessary is, in my view, neither a reasonable nor a
logical interpretation of the First Amendment,'' wrote Overton.
``James Madison would not believe that his `free exercise' clause
could ever be interpreted in this manner.''

<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators on the federal budget
said Thursday they detected a move toward compromise with the Bush
administration on which taxes should be raised.
   President Bush's recommended $1.16 trillion budget for fiscal
1990, which opens Oct. 1, proposed to bring in about $14 billion
through higher taxes, fees for government services, and sales of
government assets. The White House contends its specific proposals
don't violate Bush's ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge.
   Lawmakers said there was little chance of enactment for many of
the president's tax proposals, such as expanding the Medicare tax to
all state and local employees and cutting the capital-gains tax rate.
   ``I think they recognize the problem that the revenues that are
presented right now, that there's some difficulty in achieving
those,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Budget Committee. But it was important that the overall total of $14
billion still be raised, he said.
   Panetta and other congressional budget-writers met Thursday with
Bush budget director Richard Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, and the senior members of Congress' tax-writing committees.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said the Democrats were not proposing to raise more money
than Bush proposed.
   ``I think they understand revenues are needed and they've
outlined a number of revenues,'' he said. ``My message was whatever
we do has to be credible, that we have to show the financial markets
that we've seriously addressed the problem'' of the deficit.
   ``Yes, I think there is some movement,'' he said, when asked if
progress was made in the meeting.
   Brady declined to answer reporters' questions. Darman said there
was no change in the administration's position but he did not want
to comment on what the lawmakers said.
   The Gramm-Rudman law mandates that the federal deficit, which is
expected to exceed $163 billion this year, be reduced to $100
billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Panetta, in a breakfast speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said the scope of the budget talks would be limited by President
Bush's willingness or unwillingness to discuss raising taxes. He
said taxes needed to be raised and spending cut to produce a serious
deficit-reduction plan.
   With the budget negotiators looking for places to cut spending,
pressure continued to increase spending.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee by voice vote approved a
recommendation that Congress adopt Bush's plan to increase military
spending next year to keep pace with inflation, and boost it 1
percent above inflation the next two years.
   Rep. Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the
House Veterans Affairs Committee, told a House budget task force
that spending on veterans' health programs must increase faster than
Bush is proposing.
   ``What the budget committee decides in the next few weeks will
probably be long remembered,'' he said, citing a crisis in the
system and the contribution he said the programs make to the
nation's defense.
   ``So if we must delay the procurement of one or two bombers in
order to insure that our veterans receive needed health care, then
we must do it. It's an easy choice for me,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jewish Groups Calls for Boycott of Meetings with Pope</HEAD>

   Major U.S. Jewish groups are calling on Jews
around the world to boycott meetings with Pope John Paul II because
the Vatican has failed to remove a convent from the site of the Nazi
death camp at Auschwitz, the World Jewish Congress announced
Thursday.
   The U.S. section of the World Jewish Congress, which represents
34 American groups, adopted a resolution that calls for WJC members
in 70 countries to refrain from meetings with the pope during his
frequent travels.
   The resolution, adopted at a meeting of organization leaders in
New York, will be introduced at the May 7 meeting of the WJC's
International Executive in Montreal.
   The resolution said the boycott call was ``an expression of
anguish and moral distress'' at the Roman Catholic Church's failure
to comply with a 1987 agreement that would remove the Carmelite
convent to grounds outside the extermination camp in Poland.
   ``The convent controversy is symptomatic of a clear pattern by
the Vatican to revise the history of the Holocaust and the role of
the church during that terrible period,'' the resolution said. Pope
Pius XII has been widely criticized for failing to act or speak out
against the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews during World War II.
   The clash over the convent comes at a time of increasing tensions
between the world Jewish community and the Vatican. Nobel laureate
Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor and author, recently accused Pope
John Paul II of trying to ``de-Judaize'' the Holocaust by ignoring
Jewish suffering in speeches and comments about that era.
   Jewish groups are also angry that the pope has met twice in the
last three years with Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, who has been
accused of complicity in Nazi atrocities.
   The convent at Auschwitz was established in 1984 by a dozen
Carmelite nuns in a building the Nazis had used to store poison gas
canisters. That action set of a storm of international protest from
Jews who wanted the camp site left undisturbed as a memorial to its
victims.
   Jewish and Catholic leaders met in Geneva in 1987 and agreed that
the convent would be removed by Feb. 22, 1989. The church undertook,
in writing, to move the nuns to nearby grounds outside the camp so
they could continue their educational activities about the Holocaust.
   In recent months, Vatican officials have said a site had been
chosen for the new convent. One cleric said work on the building
would soon be completed, but a WJC delegation that visited the area
in January said it had found no construction at all.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Sags After Mild-Weather Surge in January</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing construction plummeted 11.4 percent in
February, the government reported Thursday, with analysts blaming
the sharp decline on harsher weather last month and the bite of
higher mortgage interest rates.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 million units last month
as the weather turned cold again after an unseasonably mild January.
   February's pace was down from a rate of 1.69 million units in
January, the highest level in nearly two years.
   Analysts said a longer-term slowdown in the housing market is
being caused by the steady upward climb of interest rates.
   ``We don't expect housing to suddenly fall off the cliff this
year, but we do expect it to progressively weaken with higher
interest rates,'' said economist David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association.
   Interest on fixed-rate mortgages averaged 10.86 percent last
week, up from 9.84 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   Initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages were up even more
sharply, with the starting rate on a one-year ARM averaging 8.93
percent last week, up from 7.53 percent a year earlier.
   Kent Colton, executive vice president of the National Association
of Homebuilders, said rising interest rates were the ``dominant
factor'' behind the association's forecast for a 7 percent slowdown
in housing construction this year.
   An increase of 1 percent in the interest charged on a $100,000
mortgage adds $62 a month to a homeowner's payments, Colton said.
   ``That has a big impact on affordability,'' he said.
   Housing construction reached a post-recession peak in 1986, when
1.81 million units were built, then began sliding. Last year, the
level was 1.49 million units.
   Single-family homes were built in February at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.05 million units, down 13.1 percent from
the pace in the previous month and the biggest drop in five years.
   Apartment construction, meanwhile, was down 7.2 percent in
February to an annual rate of 453,000 units. Construction of
multifamily housing peaked in 1985 and then began a sharp slide,
largely the result of changes in the tax code that made such
projects less attractive to investors.
   Berson said recent data on apartment construction have been more
encouraging, suggesting that ``the depressing effects of tax reform
and overbuilding may be behind us now.''
   Housing permits, a bellwether of future housing activity, fell
6.8 percent last month to a rate of 1.4 million units after dropping
3.8 percent during January. February's decline in permits was the
biggest drop since a 9 percent fall in January 1988.
   ``The building permits data for both months suggest that rising
rates have taken a greater toll on housing than is suggested by the
starts numbers,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the
National Association of Realtors.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been nudging interest
rates upward in an effort to slow the economy and restrain
inflation. Most analysts expect interest rates to peak at mid-year
and then gradually decline again.
   Colton, of the homebuilders, said the Fed has been reacting to
``inflation paranoia'' and risks driving the country into a
recession by pushing interest rates too high.
   ``We think that at a minimum the Federal Reserve needs to be very
careful,'' Colton said.
   Housing activity dropped last month in all four regions of the
country, with the biggest decline in the Northeast, where starts
fell 22.6 percent to 229,000 units after surging 47 percent in
January.
   Construction was down 13.7 percent in the Midwest to 277,000
units, and fell 8.7 percent in the West to 400,000 units. In the
South, starts were down 6.8 percent to 592,000.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Adopt Program To Reform Soviet Farming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: New thruout to detail changes approved in agricultural system.
No pickup. ^By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders today adopted a sweeping
reform program for the inefficient Soviet agricultural system that
they hope will end chronic food shortages.
   The plan, adopted by the plenary meeting of the party's
300-member Central Committee, would give the nation's farmers the
right to lease state-owned land for life. However, it would also
maintain the network of state and collective farms that have
chronically failed to feed the Soviet people.
   The party also elected its 100 members to the Congress of
People's Deputies, a new legislative body that will meet for the
first time this spring. Among them was President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   The plenum acted after debating Gorbachev's plan to give farmers
long-term leases on state-owned land to make them more attentive and
efficient.
   Gorbachev also says farmers should be given freedom to decide
what to plant on that land, rather than having that decided by the
bureaucracy.
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev told a news conference the
leases could be signed for any period of more than five years and be
passed on to succeeding generations of farmers. He said no one would
be forced into leasing land.
   He also said the giant state and collective farms would remain
the backbone of the Soviet agricultural system.
   ``Radical changes in rural life and production relations should
be carried out on a purely voluntary basis ... without any kind of
force or repressive methods,'' Ligachev said in his first appearance
before foreign reporters.
   Setting targets for leasing would only encourage strong-arm
tactics to fulfill the plans, Ligachev said.
   Ligachev is the Politburo member in charge of farm policy and is
widely regarded as a conservative force on the Politburo.
   Before the plenum he spoke out for including leasing in a wide
variety of methods to improve agricultural production. He said the
approach to agriculture will include leasing, self-financing and
greater democracy in rural life.
   The plenum abolished the giant ``Gosagroprom'' superministry in
charge of agricultural policy, and Gorbachev interrupted its chief,
Vsevolod Murakovsky who spoke out in favor of continuing the system
in which all local regions are required to send a percentage of
their harvest to central authorities.
   Showing his impatience with domination of local producers by the
central bureaucracy, Gorbachev interrupted again when another
speaker brought up the issue of the government orders.
   In a speech on Wednesday, Gorbachev painted a bleak picture of
Soviet agriculture, with chemically despoiled land, deliberate
destruction of sound system prevalent in the 1920s, and massive
investments gone sour. The situation is so bad that it will be years
before the country can feed itself, he said.
   Gorbachev's detailed report on years of failed reforms made it
clear that he believes nothing less than radical change will free
Soviets from rationing of meat and cheese now found in many cities.
   His proposal to abolish a government superagency created in 1985
to oversee the country's farm sector was a tacit acknowledgement of
the failure of even his early attempts to revitalize agriculture.

<HEAD>FTC Steps Up Efforts to Combat Fraud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the Federal Trade Commission said
Thursday his agency has substantially stepped up its efforts to
combat telemarketing fraud.
   FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver told a House panel that the commission
``fully supports the objectives'' of legislation intended to bring
greater state resources to bear on telemarketing fraud.
   ``It is estimated that consumers may lose over a billion dollars
a year to telemarketing scam artists,'' he said. ``Recognizing this
threat, the commission has greatly increased its enforcement efforts
in this area in recent years.''
   Oliver testified that, since 1982, the FTC has opened more than
80 investigations of telemarketers and has brought 33 fraud cases in
federal court.
   ``In these cases, the commission obtained injunctions against
companies having aggregate sales of over $628 million,'' he said.
   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials, said that
``a combined federal, state and private attack on telemarketing
fraud will bring quicker and more effective enforcement, save scarce
federal dollars and provide for more uniformity in enforcement.''
   He noted that in fiscal 1983 the FTC spent about $410,000 on
telemarketing cases. This rose to $2.3 million in fiscal 1988, and
the FTC has told the panel that its staff expects to spend $4.8
million on telemarketing investigations this fiscal year.
   Also testifying at Thursday's hearing was Nevada Attorney General
Brian McKay, who said that ``boiler room telemarketing is a
difficult problem for state law enforcement. These operators are
cheap and mobile. A boiler room essentially requires only leased
office space and a leased telephone.''
   McKay said Nevada ``has been a center for boiler room activity.
Over 50 percent of all complaints received by the Nevada Consumer
Affairs Division in 1987 concerned telemarketing. In 1988, over 54
percent of complaints were related to telemarketing.''

   Discovery's astronauts took a call
from President Bush and read the first home-delivered newspaper in
space Thursday before tending to more routine tasks such as checking
on chicken eggs and photographing the Earth.
   The space shuttle crew began its fourth day in space trouble-free
and under full electrical power after NASA engineers on Wednesday
fixed a problem with a hydrogen tank that had threatened to shorten
the mission.
   In a television-telephone hookup linking the White House and the
shuttle, Bush praised the astronauts' work and pledged continued
support of the space program.
   ``It is an inspiration to the Americans, I'll tell you, all of
us. Today's pioneers,'' said Bush, who could see the astronauts in
the shuttle cabin.
   And after Discovery commander Michael L. Coats told the president
the crew was flying something for the new first lady, Bush replied:
``She'll be thrilled. You better come up here and give it to her
personally.
   ``You're invited right as of now. So when you get back, head this
way,'' the president added.
   The astronauts also told the president about the powerful IMAX, a
70mm camera being used to shoot environmentally damaged parts of the
Earth while flying upside down 180 miles high.
   Pilot John E. Blaha said the crew was ``getting a lot of great
film that will show a lot of people around the world how fragile the
planet Earth is in this big vastness of space and maybe help
everybody to work to improve that.''
   Camera targets included a coral reef being destroyed by pollution
off east Africa, areas of deforestation in South America, an active
volcano in Guatamala and scars left by fires in Florida's Everglades
and the forests of the western United States.
   ``There's so much interest today on the global environment and I
think a lot of people will see just from your important mission the
contribution that space exploration can make to the world's
environment,'' Bush said.
   The astronauts also got the chance to read the newspaper when
ground controllers used a facsimile machine to send up a copy of the
front page of The Roundup, an employee weekly at the Johnson Space
Center.
   ``We wanted to tell you that's the first newspaper that's been
sent to an American spacecraft,'' capsule communicator Pierre Thuot
told the crew.
   The issue, which will not be distributed on Earth until Friday,
carried a lead story on the Discovery's fiery liftoff Monday and a
report about a welcome-home ceremony the space center planned for
the crew. Discovery is scheduled to land Saturday morning at Edwards
Air Force Base, Calif.
   Thursday began with a twist when the Discovery crew pre-empted
Mission Control's usual wake-up call by radioing the theme music
from ``Star Trek'' to Earth.
   Then, the recorded voice of William Shatner, who played Capt.
Kirk in television series and movies, sent congratulations to
Mission Control.
   ``Discovery,'' responded a Mission Control communicator, ``tell
Scotty to beam me up.''
   Mission Control's official wake up call was a medley of school
songs from the crew's alma maters. The tape included ``Anchor's
Aweigh'' for Naval Academy graduates Coats, James F. Buchli and
Robert C. Springer; ``Wild Blue Yonder'' for Air Force Academy
graduate Blaha, and the Drexel University fight song for Dr. James
P. Bagian, a physician who earned a bachelor's degree from the
Philadelphia school.
   Blaha later checked a student's chicken embryo experiment,
designed to determine whether the 32 fertilized eggs can develop
normally in weightlessness.
   While Blaha pulled the incubator from a locker, student John
Vellinger watched him on a television monitor from Mission Control.
   ``Let him know it's working really great,'' Blaha said.
   Another student experiment involved four rats, who each had a leg
cut shortly before launch and will be killed after landing. It is
designed to test the effects of zero gravity on bone healing in
space.
   The mission's main goal was accomplished Monday when the crew
deployed a $100 million communications satellite that completes a
network NASA will use to link communications with shuttles and other
satellites.
   Discovery, the first of seven planned shuttle missions this year,
is the third since NASA resumed manned flights following the
Challenger explosion.

<HEAD>Report Says Pesticide Pollution At Denver Arsenal Is Hurting Wildlife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Army report obtained by the Rocky Mountain News
says pesticide pollution at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal is harming
and killing wildlife, and posing a threat to humans who may eat the
tainted game.
   The report was based on a three-year study of the pollution's
effect on animals and plants at the 27-square mile superfund cleanup
site north of Stapleton International Airport, the newspaper said in
Thursday's editions.
   The report probably will determine the extent of the cleanup at
the site, a federal official said Wednesday.
   The report was compiled by Environmental Science and Engineering
Inc., an Englewood, Colo., consulting firm hired by the Army. It
found that:
   _ The flesh of game such as deer, rabbits and pheasants contained
contaminants in higher concentrations than U.S. Food and Drug
Administration levels for safe human consumption.
   _ Grasshoppers eaten by waterfowl and raptors contained mercury
and high levels of aldrin and dieldrin, pesticide components known
to cause thinning of egg shells and weight loss in birds.
   _ Dangerous levels of dieldrin in prairie dogs.
   _ A minimum of 20,000 waterfowl died during the 1950s after
landing on polluted ponds at the arsenal.
   ``Dead coyotes, owls and hawks found all over the Rocky Mountain
Arsenal had significant concentrations of pesticides in tissues,''
the report said.
   The Army manufactured chemical weapons at the facility from 1942
through the 1960s. Shell Oil Co. leased a portion of the arsenal for
pesticide production through the early 1980s. Waste from both
operations are known to have polluted groundwater, surface water and
soil at the facility.
   Use of the old arsenal has been a subject of controversy. Federal
and state officials, including Gov. Roy Romer, have suggested
turning the land into a park or wildlife preserve.
   Health officials have warned, however, that extensive cleanup
work must be completed in order for the animals to survive. If
contaminated water and soil are left untreated, pollutants will
continue to be absorbed by plants, ingested by insects and carried
up the food chain to large game animals, they say.
   ``If they continue to eat in contaminated areas, the problem is
only going to worsen,'' said Jeff Edson, a spokesman for the
Colorado Department of Health.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's project manager at the
arsenal said Wednesday the report will have an impact.
   ``It looks like the study might drive the decisions regarding how
clean it must be made,'' said Connally Mears. ``We'll pay particular
attention to the implications from the study to determine what needs
to be done to ensure protection of both public health and the
environment.''
   Army spokesman Bill Thomas in Denver said Wednesday the Army
didn't want to comment because the report was still in draft form.

<HEAD>Victims with Lawyers Claim More Injuries, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auto accident victims with lawyers claim more
neck and back injuries than those without legal assistance, an
insurance industry study reported Thursday in speculating that
lawyers drive up insurance costs.
   The study also said that, on average, one out of six accident
victims hiring lawyers was steered to a particular doctor or clinic
by the lawyer, and said that people represented by lawyers hire
substantially more chiropractors, physical therapists and
psychotherapists.
   The findings came from a study of 46,694 injury claims paid by 34
insurance companies in the spring and summer of 1987.
   Those companies sell nearly 60 percent of U.S. auto insurance.
The claims were made under five coverages: bodily injury liability,
uninsured and underinsured motorists, personal injury protection and
medical payment.
   ``States with high attorney involvement tend to have high auto
injury costs, and states with low attorney involvement tend to have
low auto injury costs,'' said the study conducted by the
All-Industry Research Advisory Council, a group of insurance
industry trade associations and companies.
   At the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, whose members are
plaintiff attorneys in personal injury cases, spokeswoman Madeline
Applebaum said no one had seen the study and she could not comment.
   The insurance group found that almost 45 percent of claimants
hired lawyers, up from more than 31 percent in 1977. The group
speculated that the ending of restrictions on advertising by lawyers
in 1978 might have helped cause the increase.
   The average bodily injury claim payment increased 139 percent in
those 10 years, well ahead of the 85 percent increase in the
Consumer Price Index.
   After noting a 124 percent increase in the cost of medical care,
the study said, ``Another possible reason for the large incurease in
auto injury costs is that attorney involvement has increased 42
percent since 1977.''

<TEXT>
   Biologists stalking a 35-foot California gray
whale lost the migrating beast in fog before they could cut away a
tangle of fishing nets that could kill it, officials said Thursday.
   The northbound whale was spotted Tuesday off Dana Point with
netting wrapped around its flukes. Wildlife experts fear it will
eventually drown, said Joe Cordero of the National Marine Fisheries
Service.
   ``We don't know how much netting is trailing underwater.
Eventually, the whale will probably tire out and die,'' said
Cordero. Biologists participating in the rescue estimated the whale
was trailing about 70 feet of netting.
   A team of biologists from the Long Beach-based Whale Rescue Unit
followed the whale from Dana Point to the Crystal Cove area off
Laguna Beach, trying several times to get close and cut away the
nets. They lost it in fog near Newport Beach, 45 miles southeast of
Los Angeles.
   ``The whale is moving at a pretty good clip and the rescuers
couldn't catch up with it,'' said Cordero.
   Agent Ray Sautter, another National Marine Fisheries Service
spokesman, said it was extremely difficult to catch a whale moving
in the water.
   ``By the time you get a small boat over there they go down
again,'' Sautter said. ``It also stresses the animal and it may do
more harm than good.''
   Another California gray whale was reported ensnared in fishing
nets early Thursday off Point Conception, 120 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, said Sautter.
   ``We are trying to get someone up there and free it,'' he said.
   Whales began migrating from the warmer waters in Mexico earlier
this month and will continue their northward treks through May.
   ``Our real problem time is really next month and into May because
the cow-calf pairs are the last to leave,'' said Sautter. ``The
young frequently get separated and get into trouble.''

   The U.S. government has tentatively concluded
that a spy ring of West German computer hackers did not gain access
to the types of secrets that would jeopardize America's national
security, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said he was
not at liberty to discuss the specific computer networks the German
hackers penetrated, what they learned in the process and what they
passed on to the Warsaw Pact.
   But, in breaking two weeks of official silence, Howard said the
Defense Department no longer viewed the case as a serious threat to
military security.
   ``Based on the information that we have thus far, and this is not
complete ... our best judgment is that the computer hackers did not
penetrate secure programs,'' Howard said.
   The initial review of evidence assembled by American and West
German authorities suggests the spy ring never gained access to the
computer systems that contain classified secrets, he continued.
   ``All this is subject to change should new information turn up in
the course of the investigation. But, to the best of our knowledge,
it does not appear at this point that there was any compromise of
classified information,'' Howard said.
   The West German government broke up the computer espionage
operation March 3, arresting three individuals and later disclosing
that eight others were still under investigation.
   On March 6, a spokesman for the chief federal prosecutor in West
Germany, Alexander Prechtel, told reporters the continuing
investigation suggested ``the information obtained by the hackers
does not appear to be that sensitive.''
   The U.S. government, however, had declined until Thursday to say
whether it agreed with that assessment.
   The West German ring was cracked in large measure through the
work of a lone U.S. computer expert, an astronomer named Clifford
Stoll. Stoll has said he observed the ring trying to break into
about 450 computer banks, and that the hackers did gain access to
the Pentagon's general data bank, named Optimus, as well as
computers at several defense contractors and U.S. military bases.
   West Germany's ARD television network has reported the hackers
also tapped NASA and ``Star Wars'' research computers. Citing
unidentified sources, the network reported that three hackers handed
over information from the United States, Japan, Britain, France,
Italy, Switzerland and West Germany during a 1985 meeting with two
KGB agents in East Berlin.
   The TV network also reported that authorities believe the West
German hackers were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency in
1985 and ``were paid with cash and drugs.''
   Howard, while breaking the U.S. government's silence on the
matter, declined to confirm precisely which computer databanks the
hackers penetrated.
   ``No classified programs. That's really about all I can say on
the subject,'' he replied.
   ``I don't have any information that would imply there was any
involvement by Americans,'' Howard added.

   The Soviet Union has notified the United States
that two 10-member teams of nuclear weapon inspectors will conduct
``short-notice inspections'' at East Coast facilities starting
Friday, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.
   The inspections, authorized by the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces Treaty ratified last year, will be the eighth and ninth such
inspections of the 20 allowed each side this year.
   ``In accordance with the INF Treaty, the teams will announce
which two sites they intend to inspect on Friday morning. And the
U.S. will then transport them to the sites where they will begin the
24-to-32 hour inspections,'' said Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard.
   The INF Treaty requires the United States and Soviet Union to
cease production, and destroy all existing stocks, of nuclear
missiles with a range of roughly 300 to 3,000 miles.

   An American soldier who vanished
for 11 days has been charged with giving East German officials U.S.
plans for defending the border against a Soviet bloc assault, the
Army said Thursday.
   A U.S. military statement said the East Germans notified U.S.
authorities that Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri had made contact with them.
Peri disappeared from his unit near the East German border Feb. 21,
taking a portable computer with him.
   The 21-year-old soldier from Laguna Niguel, Calif., turned
himself in 11 days later after a search that left American military
officials baffled.
   In Washington, Pentagon sources said privately the East German
government was quietly asked for help in locating Peri soon after
his disappearance because, one said, ``we had no idea if he was a
defector, had been hurt or whatever.''
   Several days after the request, ``we finally heard back from them
saying they had identified such a person and had interviewed him,
but that he had left,'' the source said.
   ``We now believe he left East Germany, went to Austria and then
back into West Germany to his unit. We know he once lived in Austria
before he joined the Army, but we really don't know exactly what's
going on here.''
   Peri also brought back the computer he took from his unit, where
he worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist, officials
have said.
   ``The specific information that we have based the charges on
pertains to his unit's general defense plan,'' Lt. Col. Jake Dye,
the U.S. Army 5th Corps spokesman, told The Associated Press in
response to a question.
   ``I am not really in a position to give any more information.
It's inappropriate to comment any more pending the outcome of the
investigation.'' Peri was assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry
Regiment, which isresponsible for a front-line defense at the
border. The unit, based in Fulda about 65 miles northeast of
Frankfurt, is equipped with tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   In a statement sent to news media, the 5th Corps said Peri ``has
been charged with espionage _ communicating documents and-or
information relating to national defense to the German Democratic
Republic (GDR).''
   ``He was further charged with unlawfully having classified
information in his possession; removing classified documents from a
classified document storage area; moving classified documents to the
GDR and transfer of classified information to unauthorized
persons,'' the statement said.
   It provided no further details about the information Peri
allegedly provided the East Germans and did not mention any money
changing hands or a possible motive. It said no date had been set
for his trial.
   Maj. Samuel Taylor, deputy spokesman for 5th Corps, told the AP
the matter was ``U.S. national defense information as far as it
pertains to our NATO mission and to the general defense plan as a
NATO force.''
   According to the written statement, Peri was charged with
``failure to obey the lawful regulations that require him to get
permission to travel to the German Democratic Republic.''
   Regulations also required him to check with his unit's special
security officer ``before going into a Communist-controlled
country.''
   The statement did not say where Peri went in East Germany or how
he crossed the heavily guarded border. He was being held at
Mannheim, West Germany, and already has been charged with such other
offenses as being absent without leave.
   Some news reports speculated that he defected because a military
vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near Obersuhl, a remote town
northeast of Fulda and near the border.
   U.S. officials said Peri had been stationed in West Germany since
March 1988. He was responsible for operating equipment that detects
enemy radar and other signals.
   Before his arrest, Army officials said, Peri was ``a good
clean-cut soldier'' with a ``perfect record.''
   ``In fact, he had been promoted and nominated for `Soldier of the
Month' twice in the year he has been here,'' Dye said earlier this
month. ``That's what makes it so baffling.''
   Those who thought Peri had defected recalled that Pvt. Wade E.
Roberts, 22, of Riverside, Calif., defected in March 1987 with his
West German girlfriend to the Soviet Union.
   Roberts returned to the United States in November 1987. He was
tried as a deserter and given a bad-conduct discharge after
conviction on the lesser charge of being absent without leave.

<TEXT>
   A group of more than a dozen House Democrats
will draw up a family issues agenda for their party and serve as
watchdogs to make sure President Bush keeps his promises in that
area, Speaker Jim Wright said Thursday.
   Wright said the group, led by Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., would
draw up a list of legislative goals for the 101st Congress,
including improvements in the Women's, Infants and Children feeding
program, child immunization, day care, Head Start, parental leave
and school dropout prevention.
   The group also will recommend an initiative aimed at barring
``inappropriate'' television programs during children's viewing
hours and enriching programming at those times, Wright said.
   The panel will give the House Budget Committee figures on
financing levels needed for such programs and will monitor the Bush
administration's progress in keeping campaign commitments for
education and other family programs, he said.

<HEAD>Judge: Christian Group Has Right To Distribute Literature On Beach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town of South Padre Island agreed
Thursday to allow a Christian group to pass out its tracts on the
beaches during spring break after a federal judge defended the
rights of the evangelists.
   Ministers had sued the resort town after an official sent them a
letter advising that distribution of the literature would violate an
anti-soliciting ordinance.
   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela, however, advised the town at a
hearing that ``the public beaches are a public forum'' and that
handing out religious literature was protected by the Constitution.
   Ministers Kevin Pitt and Jerry Davis, and Davis' Street Reach
Ministries sued here Tuesday after receiving a letter from Gary
Becher, public works director for the island.
   In the Feb. 3 letter to Pitt, Belcher wrote, ``I interpret
preaching the word of God as soliciting and (it) therefore falls
under these ordinances.''
   After Vela's remarks, South Padre Island officials agreed to
leave the ministers alone as long as they did not solicit funds on
the beaches, said Paul Cunningham, town attorney.
   Vela said the agreement obviated the need for a restraining order
against the town.
   Attorney Jay Sekulow, representing the Christian group, said,
``It's unfortunate that it did have to come to court, because
frankly all that was involved was the distribution of free religious
literature and sharing Jesus on the beaches of South Padre Island.''
   Pitt, youth minister at Brownsville's non-denominational Word of
God Family Church, said the group wants to provide an alternative to
companies promoting beer and condoms to the 200,000 to 300,000
students expected to visit the island 25 miles northeast of
Brownsville during the month of March.

<HEAD>School Board Makes Flag Salute Mandatory Despite State Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YERMO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students will be required to salute the flag
under a school board decision directing district administrators to
delete a section of the state education code stating that a salute
is not mandatory.
   ``Communism comes from liberalism,'' Silver Valley Unified School
District board president Bob Woltman said Wednesday, adding that he
is ``tired of liberalism in public schools.''
   ``It's good for kids to honor our flag, as it shows love for a
country that offers the greatest opportunity in the world for people
of all faiths and races,'' said Trustee Carl von Badinski.
   A part of the education code allowing school boards to conform
with a federal court ruling on individual freedom states:
``Individuals shall not be required to participate in the salute to
the flag.''
   Trustees of the district in the middle of the Mojave Desert
ordered administrators to delete the paragraph when the policy comes
up for final board review on March 27.
   According to the district's assistant superintendent, William
Maybee, other provisions of the education code require elementary
school classes to begin each day with the Pledge of Allegiance and
``an appropriate patriotic exercise'' in secondary school classes.
   The U.S. Supreme Court in 1943 ruled that the government may not
compel citizens to salute the flag.
   ``Freedom of religion has nothing to do with saluting the flag,''
von Badinski said. ``In this country, people have the right to
worship any religion they desire, but it doesn't give them the right
not to salute the flag.''

<HEAD>Senate Democrats Privately Debate Legislative Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats debated in private on Thursday
over a broad agenda for the 101st Congress that pledges not to
``oppose the (Bush) administration automatically, but to propose new
policies and pursue them cooperatively.''
   A 10-page draft ``agenda for action'' that served as the basis
for the closed-door discussion shied away from specifics on many of
the major issues confronting Congress. It omitted any mention of the
possible use of higher taxes to reduce the deficit, and skipped over
details of any effort to resolve the savings and loan crisis.
   At the same time, it called for enactment of a lengthy list of
legislation that seemed certain to spark combat with the Bush
administration, ranging from a hike in the minimum wage to a program
of national volunteer service, strengthened environmental
enforcement and widespread, affordable health care.
   It also called for an expanded commitment to education, research
and development, agriculture and trade.
   ``It is not a political platform,'' said the draft that produced
debate two days in a row at closed party caucuses just off the
Senate floor. ``Neither can it include every item of interest to
every senator, or accommodate every difference of emphasis and
viewpoint.''
   Democrats initially hoped to make a public release of the
material on Friday, but officials indicated the date was likely to
slip past the two-week Easter recess that begins at the end of the
week. They said some changes had been made in the draft, a copy of
which was made available to The Associated Press, but declined to
discuss them.
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who was in charge of the effort
to produce the agenda, said the discussion had been a ``healthy
debate,'' that centered in part on the concerns by some senators
that the draft was short on specifics. Other senators said Democrats
might try to come up with a second, more concrete set of promposals
later in the year.
   The proposed agenda grew out of a commitment by Sen. George
Mitchell of Maine, the newly elected majority leader, to consult
widely with other Democrats and produce a set of legislative
guidelines for Democrats to adhere to during the two-year Congress
that convened in January.
   Mitchell appointed Daschle to coordinate the effort, and the
result of Daschle's conversations with Democratic senators was
reflected in the draft agenda that he and the majority leader
presented to the 55-member Democratic caucus on Wednesday and
Thursday.
   ``With this report we offer the president our hand,'' said the
draft. ``We do not expect the administration to accept every item.
We seek only cooperation and progress.''
   It says that the job for Democrats in Congress is ``not to oppose
the administration automatically, but to propose new policies and
pursue them cooperatively.''
   The draft agenda committed Democrats to ensuring a prosperous
economy, protecting the national security, preserving the
environment and defending ``essential family values,'' and outlined
specific legislation to accomplish each of those goals.
   But on many of the most contentious issues, Democrats shied away
from specifics in their draft. ``It is imperative that we
significantly reduce budget and trade deficits,'' they said. But the
only two specific steps mentioned for deficit reduction are a demand
for ``realistic economic projections'' and insisting on ``accurate
calculations of budget numbers.''
   When it comes to the faltering savings and loan industry, the
draft agenda called for taking legal action against those who
committed fraud and abuse and urged unspecified ``tough new
regulatory reform.''

   Except for one thing, Deeanne Eggleston is a
lot like hundreds of other adventurous bicyclists planning to ride
across the country this summer.
   The difference is that Eggleston is legally blind.
   The ride is her attempt to prove to others _ and maybe to herself
_ that people with disabilities should pursue their dreams despite
risks.
   For her, that means ``putting my life on the line'' in order to
feel more alive.
   ``I've been called really stupid for doing this. People ask why I
feel I have to do it,'' says the soft-spoken 38-year-old. ``But I
think that's what life is. I can't just be sitting around.''
   She leaves April 1, and hopes to arrive in Washington D.C. by
late July.
   ``I see this as a project about the preconceived ideas and
beliefs about people who are different,'' she said in a telephone
interview from her home in Novato, about 30 miles north of San
Francisco.
   Eggleston will be accompanied by a sighted companion, and they'll
communicate through two-way helmet radios. A support car will follow.
   The planned route rolls down the Pacific Coast to Los Angeles,
then across Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee and
Virginia.
   Along the way, she plans to meet with civic leaders, speak to
Rotary groups, compare notes with other disabled people and, she
hopes, create a lasting impression of what the disabled can do.
   Before she lost her sight a decade ago, Eggleston, a diabetic,
was an athletic graduate student and amateur photographer.
   First the disease took away the feeling in her feet. Then, just
as she was completing requirements for a masters degree in
psychotherapy, she started losing her sight. She now has only 6
percent vision in one eye _ just enough to distinguish fuzzy shadows
from light.
   ``I always had a dream of riding a bicycle across the U.S. and a
dream of taking pictures of people across the United States. But
with school and my career, there was never time,'' she said.
   Her blindness prompted her to ``question the way I'd been looking
at the world.''
   She first resumed her interest in portrait photography. Using the
little sight she has, she frames her subject in the viewfinder. But
the photos are intentionally out of focus. The idea is to show her
perception of the world.
   ``If I have a perfectly focused picture, it's an accident,'' she
said, boasting that ``many, many famous portrait photographers say I
capture things that others can't.''
   Cycling is a greater challenge. She can't feel the pedals with
her feet. She can't see curbs or potholes.
   She first prepared herself for months by lifting weights and
practicing on a stationary bike. When she was ready to try riding a
bicycle last December, friends helped her get one in San Francisco.
But she waited until after they were gone to get on it.
   Then she took the mountain bike with 1.9-inch balloon tires, onto
the wide, smooth driveway outside her condominium.
   ``I spent about 20 minutes just straddling it before I had the
nerve to actually put my feet on the pedals and start moving,'' she
said recalling how frightened she was.
   Finally, she decided to ride in a big circle. Off she went,
repeating the round path until she realized she was near a curb. She
turned to miss it, but almost hit a garage. ``And then my fear was
real.''
   Since then, she says ``it's just been a continuous building up of
confidence.''
   She listens carefully for the sound of oncoming traffic. She
makes the most of what sight she has.
   She learned Wednesday that the woman who will start the trip with
her will be able to go only as far as Dallas. But she is confident
she'll be able to find someone to ride with her from there, or will
somehow find the nerve to go it alone.
   ``If we have to end it in Dallas, there'll be some disappointment
in that,'' she said Thursday. ``But to say I went across the country
on a bicycle really is not what my goal has ever been.''
   Eggleston extended her training routes gradually to the point
where she now rides between 20 and 45 miles a day by herself on the
quiet roads around her home.
   ``One day I was heading down a hill, and I was picking up speed
and I was very afraid. Suddenly, I raised my head and felt the wind
in my face. And I felt like I was kissing the wind.''

<HEAD>Two Fasting Detainees Seriously Ill, Lawyers Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two detainees who have been on
a hunger strike to demand they be freed or put on trial are
seriously ill but are refusing medical treatment and food, lawyers
said Thursday.
   The two black activists are among several dozen detainees
refusing to eat in protest of the 33-month-old state of emergency
measures that allow police to hold people for an undetermined time
without trial.
   Sandile Thusi, 26, marked his 27th day without food Thursday and
was growing weak at a hospital in Durban, according to his lawyer,
Dhaya Pillay.
   Donsie Khumalo, a labor union official, was in ``extremely
serious'' condition at a Pretoria prison, according to his lawyer,
Peter Harris. The attorney said Khumalo has been on hunger strike
for only seven days, but he was refusing water as well as food.
   In Durban, about 3,500 students at the University of Natal held a
rally in support of the detainees.
   ``A university cannot perform its proper role in society under
the institutionalized abuse of human rights,'' the vice chancellor
of the university, P.D. Booysen, told the crowd.
   Detainees in Johannesburg began the hunger strike Jan. 23 and as
many as 500 have participated for varying lengths of time since
then. Most strikers resumed eating when Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok promised Feb. 16 to release a substantial number of
detainees.
   Vlok said Wednesday he has authorized 400 releases, leaving about
400 people in detention. Anti-apartheid groups have questioned the
figures and accused Vlok of reneging on his pledge.
   Many of those released have been placed under tight restrictions
that limit their movements and activities.
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained
for varying lengths of time since the government imposed the
emergency regulations, which give security forces wide powers and
ban most forms of peaceful protest.
   In another development, a political activist who has been in
hiding for three years turned himself in to authorities Thursday.
Police had sought Johnny Issel for alleged violations of the
country's Internal Security Act, which covers a wide range of
activities considered subversive.
   Issel was released on bail pending a court hearing April 18.

<HEAD>Official Says Third World Debt Plan Could Cut Total Owed by 20 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief architect of the Bush
administration's debt-reduction initiative estimated Wednesday that
the plan could cut the total debt owed by 39 Third World countries
by about 20 percent over the next three years.
   The estimate by Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford during
congressional testimony was the first public acknowledgement by the
administration of the scope of its new initiative, which was
unveiled last week by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   The administration's effort, which represents a major switch in
U.S. policy, got the endorsement Thursday of Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who issued a statement expressing full
support for the principles behind Brady's proposal.
   However, many members of Congress remained unsatisfied with both
the amount of detail the administration was willing to provide and
also with major elements of the administration's debt-forgiveness
proposal.
   While praising President Bush for at least doing more than the
Reagan administration, Democrats in both the Senate and House
charged that the Bush initiative lacked the boldness needed to solve
the pressing problems of poverty that have engulfed Latin America in
a new wave of political and economic instability.
   ``We need more,'' Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., told Mulford. ``More
details, more careful thinking and bolder international
initiatives.''
   But Mulford, who testified before a Senate Banking subcommittee
and later to a House Banking subcommittee, asked members of Congress
to give the plan a chance to work.
   He said that the plan's initial success could be determined by
the first week in April, when the 151-nation World Bank and
International Monetary Fund meet in Washington to discuss Third
World debt matters.
   After the Reagan administration refused for years to endorse any
broad-based efforts at debt forgiveness, the Bush administration has
now put forward a plan that encourages banks to voluntarily forgive
part of the debt owed to them by Third World countries.
   The Brady Plan, as it was being called during the hearings, moves
away from the so-called 1985 Baker Plan, named for Brady's
predecessor at Treasury and now Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   Mulford said that the Brady proposal projected a possible 20
percent reduction in the debt owed by 39 Third World countries and
an additional 20 percent reduction in the amount of debt interest
payments these countries would be required to make over the next
three years.
   The 39 developing countries, which include the largest debtor
nations and many of the smaller ones, collectively owe $340 billion.
A 20 percent reduction in that debt over three years would total $70
billion with another $20 billion in relief coming from a 20 percent
reduction in the estimated $102 billion in interest payments these
countries would be required to make over the next three years.
   Mulford stressed that these projections were only rough estimates
and would vary widely from country to country.
   A country like Mexico, generally considered a ``good'' debtor
nation because it has strived to implement necessary economic
reforms, could ``considerably exceed,'' the 20 percent estimate,
Mulford said.
   On the other hand, he said that some countries might realize no
debt reduction at all if they fail to implement needed economic
reforms.
   ``It is very important not to get pinned down on a specific set
of numbers because numbers invariably raise expectations or depress
expectations, depending on one's point of view,'' Mulford said.
   He was responding to questions concerning a report in Thursday's
Wall Street Journal, which said the Treasury Department estimates
had been provided privately in meetings with representatives of
commercial banks.
   Several members of Congress expressed qualms that the Brady plan
did not go far enough in providing debt relief, especially in Latin
America, where living standards have been falling since the debt
crisis first erupted seven years ago.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said the flood of refugees and illegal
drugs into the United States was directly related to the growing
poverty in the region. He said the only surprise in the
debt-triggered riots which left 300 dead two weeks ago was that they
occurred in Venezuela, ``one of the most prosperous countries in the
region.''
   The Brady plan was endorsed Thursday by Greenspan, whose
statement was issued after several reports of a behind-the-scenes
battle between the Federal Reserve and the administration over the
proposal.
   In his statement, Greenspan said, ``I fully support the
principles put forward by Secretary Brady last Friday for helping
the heavily indebted countries to resolve their economic and
financial problems. ... The challenge ahead for all of us is to
reinvigorate the process and ensure that it works.''
   As part of his testimony, Mulford also released several reports
saying the administration opposed establishing an international
agency to facilitate the writing off of debt.
   He said that the resources of the IMF and World Bank were
sufficient to handle the problem and a new agency was not needed.
   Under the Brady plan, both organizations would support direct
debt relief and would provide guarantees covering the reduced debt
remaining after the write-offs.

   Here are remarks by Peggy Say, sister of Terry
Anderson, at a ceremony Thursday marking the fourth year of
Anderson's captivity as a hostage in Lebanon:
   ``Three-and-a-half years ago, at the beginning of our struggle to
make the world aware that there were hostages being held in Lebanon,
Father Martin Jenco and Terry Anderson lay chained and blindfolded,
scant feet from William Buckley.
   ``Bill Buckley became ill and delirious from pneumonia
complications, eventually losing his battle to live, as his fellow
hostages prayed for him. Bill Buckley died on June 3, 1985, and the
world stood silent.
   ``On April 17, 1986, American Peter Kilborn and two British
hostages were executed in retaliation for the U.S. raid on Libya.
Americans applauded this hostile act, and the families of the
hostages buried their dead. In 1987, French hostage Michel Seurat
became so ill that he was reduced to crawling on his hands and knees
to use the toilet. He died before the horrified eyes of his fellow
hostages, and once again the world stood silent.
   ``Today, we know that of the nine American hostages being held,
one has gone mad and another has twice attempted suicide. Two
hostages tried to escape and were beaten senseless by their captors.
Terry Anderson has pounded his head against the dirty, stone wall of
his cell until the blood ran. Frustrated, angry, lonely and tired of
being caged like an animal, he finally broke.
   ``How long will America stand silent in the face of this
abomination? How long will their fellow Americans debate and discuss
what, if anything, should be done to free these innocent men while
they waste away and some go mad and some die and we still continue
to debate and discuss.
   ``This is not or should not be a political issue. This is a human
rights issue, a humanitarian concern, a crime against humanity in
the words of (U.N. Secretary-General Javier) Perez de Cuellar and
still we discuss and debate and some die and some go mad.
   ``Enough is enough I say. No more debate. No more discussion. Our
message to their captors, to President Bush and to the world must be
that simple: Enough is enough. In the words of Terry Anderson, this
cannot continue. I say again: This cannot continue. Enough, for
God's sake, enough.''

<HEAD>Government Says Apples Not ``Imminent Hazard'' to Kids</HEAD>

   Federal health officials sought Thursday to
calm growing public fear over the consumption of apples by children,
telling Congress that pesticide levels on apples pose no ``imminent
hazard'' to pre-schoolers.
   Some senators said the uproar over the use of the chemical Alar
on apples and its health effects on small children has produced an
apple scare that threatens the industry from New York to Washington
state.
   ``The apple market is dead as a doornail right now across
America,'' said Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, whose family is in the
apple business. Other senators said they now hesitate to give apple
products to their own children.
   Many apple growers and processors say their apples are free of
Alar, which has been linked to cancer in animal tests. But large
numbers of parents are reported to have stopped giving apples to
their children since a private environmental group said youngsters
were especially at risk from the chemical because they eat more
apples and apple products than adults.
   School districts in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, San
Francisco, Miami and elsewhere have stopped providing apples in
school cafeterias since the report by the Natural Resources Defense
Council gained widespread publicity last month.
   At a Senate subcommittee hearing on the apple controversy, Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., urged the Bush administration ``to exercise some
crisis control'' because apple growers, even those who do not use
Alar, are being hurt and parents are confused by conflicting
information.
   Three federal agencies _ the Food and Drug Administration,
Environmental Protection Agency and Agriculture Department _ issued
a joint statement urging parents and school officials to continue
providing children apples and apple products, saying there is no
``imminent hazard posed to children in the consumption of apples at
this time, despite claims to the contrary.''
   ``The federal government believes that it is safe for Americans
to eat apples,'' said the statement.
   FDA Administrator Frank Young reminded senators that earlier this
week he moved swiftly to direct Chilean fruit off grocery shelves
after traces of cyanide were found in two imported grapes. He
declared he would do the same if he thought apples were a danger to
children.
   In Miami, meanwhile, the president of a food industry group said
monetary losses from the two fruit scares ``will probably be felt
all through the system.''
   Robert Aders, president of the Food Marketing Institute, said,
``Is it going to lay on the producers or the consumers? My guess is
it's going to be shared.''
   Young said that of 800 apple samples tested by the FDA for Alar
since 1981 the highest residue levels found were 8 parts per
million, which is less than half the 20 parts per million allowed by
the EPA.
   ``There is not a significant risk at this time facing the
American people in the consumption of apples,'' said Young, adding
at another point that ``dramatic action'' by consumers such as
withholding apples from their children ``is not warranted. ... There
does not appear to be a need for panic.''
   James Moore, acting deputy EPA administrator, said any suggestion
that there is a ``massive public health problem'' from pesticides on
fruits and that children are gravely at risk ``is simply untrue.''
   Moore in his testimony criticized the private study's risk
estimates as not being scientifically sound and said the report has
caused ``misinformation and fear'' among parents and school
officials.
   Nevertheless, he told the Senate subcommittee on children,
families, drug abuse and alcoholism that he favors getting Alar off
the market and that if the chemical were newly introduced it would
not be approved. The EPA announced earlier in the year it was
seeking to have Alar removed from production, but the process could
take three years.
   Sen. Brock Adams, R-Wash., suggested that Uniroyal Inc., the
manufacturer of Alar, ``would do us all a public service if they
suspended production of the product'' because the controversy is
harming the apple industry. Uniroyal has disputed preliminary EPA
findings that daminozide, as Alar is technically called, causes
cancer.
   Adams said most growers in Washington state do not use
daminozide, but there was no agreement among witnesses as to how
widespread the use of the chemical actually is.
   Young said the FDA has concluded that about 10 percent of the
apples are sprayed with Alar, but the EPA has cited a figure of
about 5 percent.
   Actress Meryl Streep, who has been in the forefront of the
campaign against Alar and is a leader of Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits, questioned whether anyone knows the extent of the
danger from Alar and other pesticides on food products.
   ``I think what we don't know about this issue is what's so
alarming,'' Ms. Streep, the mother of three small children, said.

   University researchers in Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania and Michigan reported results of two separate
experiments Thursday which could someday lead to new drugs to use
against cancer.
   _University of Michigan researchers reported what they said was
the first stimulation of the immune system in mucous-lined tissues
against a cancer-causing chemical.
   This could lead to inoculations that could keep some
cancer-causing chemicals and toxins from being absorbed by the body.
   _A team from Harvard University and the University of
Pennsylvania reported tests of a complex compound that, when given
with certain steroid drugs, is up to 1,000 times more powerful than
current drugs in inhibiting the growth of small capillary blood
vessels that tumors need for growth.
   Without the steroids, the compound is a powerful stimulator of
capillary growth, which is necessary for ovulation, menstruation and
growth of the placenta in women and wound repair in both sexes.
   Whether suppressing capillary growth is a fruitful anti-cancer
strategy has to await safe and effective suppressors, the
Harvard-Pennsylvania group said.
   Both reports were published in the issue of Science magazine
which is published Friday.
   Many body tissues exposed to the outside environment are lined
with mucous, particularly the nose and mouth.
   If those tissues are invaded by a virus, a bacterially produced
toxin or similar agent, which might produce a cold or other illness,
they secrete antibodies. If the virus reappears, the antibodies bind
to it and prevent its absorption, as is believed to happen with the
viruses that cause colds.
   Vaccines such as the Sabin oral polio vaccine work, in part, by
priming this secretory immune system, one of several in the body, to
generate antibodies.
   But ordinary chemical molecules are generally too small to elicit
such a response.
   At the University of Michigan, Lawrence K. Silbart, a
toxicologist who is a research fellow in pathology, and David F.
Keren, professor of pathology, bound a powerful cause of cancer in
laboratory animals, 2-acetylaminofluorene or AAF, to the toxin
produced by the cholera-causing bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
   They measured absorption into the bloodstream of a radioactive
derivative of the AAF-toxin complex across the membrane of the
intestines of rabbits immunized with the complex and compared that
with the absorption of the same substance in a control group of
rabbits immunized with an unrelated toxin. Absorption of AAF into
the blood was more than twice in the control group as it was in the
test group.
   The article said the results suggest ``that oral vaccines against
carcinogens and toxicants could be developed for humans.''
   As to the absorption after immunization, ``Ideally, we'd like to
eliminate it completely,'' said Keren in an interview. ``In nature
you're going to be exposed to chronic low doses and you might see''
reductions of a factor of 100 or so.
   ``This is the first hard evidence that you can make the secretory
(immune) response ... and that it can interfere'' with absorption of
the carcinogen, but ``many years of work'' are needed to produce a
useful vaccine, he said.
   The Harvard-Pennsylvania team, led by Judah Folkman, professor of
surgery at the Harvard Medical School, noted that heparin, a complex
chemical used as an anti-coagulant drug, has been found to promote
capillary growth by itself and to inhibit that growth when combined
with certain steroids.
   Not all investigators have been able to find the anti-capillary
effect, and the Harvard-Pennsylvania team wrote that ``potent
inhibition of angiogenesis (capillary formation and growth) ... is
also subject to the variable activity of different heparin
preparations.''
   Those preparations have been ``nonuniform and heterogeneous in
composition, molecular size, structure, position of subtituents and
sequence. This heterogeneity probably accounts'' for the variability
in findings of the effects of heparin.
   The team used beta-cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate, a
doughnut-shaped compound made up of seven repeating units of a
substance called glucopyranose with two sulfate groups attached to
each unit.
   The ``hole in the doughnut'' is necessary to carry the steroid
drug to the surface of the target cells, the investigators theorized.
   Tested in chick embryos and rabbit corneas, the activity of
beta-cyclodestrin tetradecasulfate showed vessel-suppressing
activity ``100 to 1,000 times that of commercially available
heparin,'' fully reproducible from one preparation to another.
   In the corneas, the substance used with cortexolone ``decreased
vessel growth to 18 percent of that of untreated control eyes,''
measured according to vessel length, and to 8 percent according to
the density of blood vessels. By itself, beta-cyclodestrin
tetradecasulfate stimulated vessel length to 164 percent of
untreated controls.

   The government said Thursday that a
triple disaster of floods, an earthquake and a cyclone has left at
least 80,000 people homeless in this landlocked southern African
country, and perhaps as many as 110,000.
   Freak winds wrecked the homes of about 24,000 people, ripping
roofs off buildings, uprooting trees and flattening crops in the
northern district of Karonga on the shores of Lake Malawi, a
government spokesman said.
   Reports of the cyclone reached Blantyre as the government mounted
a rescue operation to resettle 56,000 people in central and southern
districts hit by floods and an earthquake that razed houses already
weakened by floodwaters.
   Falling masonry crushed two people to death in the earthquake on
Friday, and six others were reported drowned in the flooding.
   The spokesman, who by custom was not identified, said the cyclone
struck several days ago, but no reports of casualties had been
received from local administrators in Karonga.
   He said the state National Disaster Preparedness Committee was
waiting for more information from remote areas before making an
international appeal for emergency aid.
   He said efforts were being made to verify reports that an
additional 30,000 people lost their homes, livestock and crops in
flooding in remote areas over the last 10 days.
   On Tuesday, the goverment said it began a rescue operation using
canoes and motor launches to evacuate tens of thousands of people
left homeless by flooding in the central and southern districts of
Nchala, Chikwawa and Nsanje.
   Torrential rain cut roads and a rail line, swept away mud-built
villages and created an 50-mile lake at Nsanje, near the
southeastern border with Mozambique.
   About 600,000 refugees have fled into southern Malawi to escape
the conflict between government forces and rebels in Mozambque.
   Many refugees are believed to have been affected by the prolonged
seasonal rains.
   The earthquake damaged the homes of 800 people at Salima, about
225 miles north of Blantyre in central Malawi.

<HEAD>Government Concludes Study Of A Century's Rainfall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration have completed a study of world rainfall
over the last century, creating a new standard by which to measure
the greenhouse effect.
   ``What this gives us is a baseline,'' said Maurice Blackmon, NOAA
climatological research director, of the five-year study scheduled
for release Friday.
   ``If you've got some major deviation, bigger than anything else
that has been observed, you'd have to start looking for some new
kind of variable ... such as the greenhouse effect.''
   The study shows that precipitation has decreased over parts of
the Northern Hemisphere and increased in the Southern Hemisphere
over the past century.
   Rainfall in Northern Hemisphere areas south of 30 degrees
latitude _ regions such as Mexico, Central America and
drought-ridden North Africa _ decreased by about 20 percent, the
study found. Rainfall in the Southern Hemisphere rose about 5
percent.
   The findings are consistent with theories of the greenhouse
effect, a suspected global warming due to a steady buildup, of about
4 percent a year, of carbon dioxide, methane and other ``greenhouse
gases'' since the era of heavy industry began.
   The study predicts temperature increases of up to 5 degrees and
fluctuations in rainfall near the equator over the next 50 years.
   But atmospheric scientists emphasized that rainfall trends
observed in the study don't prove the greenhouse effect is at work.
   Global environmental changes ``can only be measured over a period
of years,'' said Henry Diaz, who studied records from more than
2,000 weather stations. ``We cannot tell whether the climate is
changing by looking at the weather each year. To detect change in
climate, you need many decades.''
   Blackmon said it was possible that fluctuations over the last
century were ``due to a recurring kind of anomaly not related to the
greenhouse effect.''
   But he added, ``If it (the warming) lasts another ten years, it
would be unprecedented.''
   In 10 years, ``unfortunately it will be too late to do much about
the problem,'' said Michael Schlesinger, the Oregon State University
atmospheric scientist who developed a model for predicting effects
of global warming.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Marshals' Service said Thursday a
critical audit commissioned by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
didn't accurately represent the agency's operations.
   U.S. Marshals Service spokesman Stephen Boyle said the finding
that the agency's financial management system was only ``marginally
adequate'' was ``not supported by the specific findings in the
report.''
   ``That language is taken from their coversheet, their
generalization of their findings,'' Boyle said.
   He said the study actually found that ``files and paperwork were
not located in a form or fashion the auditors thought was
desirable.''
   ``That didn't suggest there was anything unaccounted for,'' Boyle
said.
   Neither Boyle nor the Justice Department would release the audit,
which was disclosed in The Washington Post.
   But Boyle offered a point by point rebuttal of the findings
reported in the Post, saying: ``to the extent that the auditors
found nothing to suggest failure in meeting our operational
requirements, nothing suggesting fraud or misuse of funds is a very
positive result.''
   ``An audit is an exercise to find fault. They found fault but
what they found we think was of minimal signficance to our principal
mission,'' he said.
   ``We consider the entire audit a declaration that the Marshals
Service is in extremely good shape except for the fact that some of
the auditors who did the audit would like to see us with a larger
bureaucracy.''
   Boyle cited a finding that the agency's procurement staff still
had not begun efforts recoup overcharges by private security firms
that were uncovered in a 1987 audit.
   The staff responsible for collecting the money overcharged by
security firms in eight judicial disticts had postponed that effort
while renegotiating contracts with private contractors hired to
guard courthouses and prisons.
   ``It's not as matter of the money disappearing,'' Boyle said.
``The bills are in hand. We simply have to devote the contracts
personnel to go back and pursue the collections which we will be
doing.''
   A finding that several of the agency's small airplanes used for
hauling prisoners were not designed for that purpose ``was a
particularly good example of the auditors reflecting bad
information,'' Boyle said.
   Seven of the 13 small planes are being refurbished so they can be
used to transport prisoners, Boyle said. The Federal Aviation
Administration gave the Marshals Service the surplus aircraft last
year, he said.
   The audit also found the Marshals' Service has not conducted
adequate background checks of people hired to protect courthouses or
guard prisoners.
   Boyle said private security firms are responsible for checking
the backgrounds of guards it furnishes under contracts. Off-duty
policemen hired to guard prisoners in hospitals are usually provided
by local police departments, he said.
   ``It isn't a matter of people walking in off the street in police
uniforms,'' he said. The gaurds are hired as result of ``formal
contacts with official representatives'' of local police departments.
   The audit also found the agency once leased an airplane for
$10,000 to transport director Stanley E. Morris and two other people
from Washington to Oklahoma City after a Marshals' Service plane
broke down.
   Boyle said the plane was leased because Morris and seven other
senior officials could not have traveled by commercial airlines in
time to attend the ceremony.

   An activist who got Florida to pass a law
waiving tolls for disabled drivers has been named 1989 Disabled
American of the Year. ``This is the most important recognition I've
had,'' Beverly Chapman said Wednesday. She was Miss Wheelchair
America in 1977 and has received numerous local awards.
   ``There are 38 million disabled Americans, many of them
outstanding individuals, and to be selected above all the others is
overwhelming,'' she said.
   Chapman, 40, has been paralyzed almost totally by muscular
dystrophy. She breathes with the help of a respirator attached to
her wheelchair and drives a van equipped with hand controls.
   In 1986, she began running tollbooths in an effort to get the
highway authority to accommodate disabled drivers who had trouble
tossing coins into toll baskets.
   Last year, the Legislature passed the Bevery Chapman Act, which
waives tolls for severely disabled drivers at all state tollbooths.
   The award will be presented May 10 in Tampa at the annual
convention of the President's Committee on Employment of People With
Disabilities, with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole as the keynote
speaker.

<TEXT>
   The government lost money on timber sales in
more than two-thirds of the nation's 120 national forests during
fiscal 1988, but still recorded an overall profit of $388.7 million,
the Forest Service said Thursday.
   In its second annual accounting of the costs and benefits of
national forest timber sales, the Forest Service said its timber
sales program made a profit of $442.2 million in 46 national
forests, mostly in the California, Washington, Oregon, Arizona New
Mexico and the parts of Southeast.
   The logging program in the other 74 national forests lost a total
of $53.7 million. Officials said more than 80 percent of the 12.6
billion board feet of timber harvested from national forests was
taken from forests where revenues exceeded expenses.
   Peter M. Emerson, chief economist and vice president for resource
planning and economics for the Wilderness Society, said the report
reinforces the society's view that the Forest Service's timber sales
program is an ``environmentally destructive federal boondoggle.''
   The Wilderness Society has been urging the Forest Service for
several years to halt timber sales in national forests where
expenses exceed revenue. The society contends that logging
activities in such forests usually are the most damaging to the
environment, since the trees tend to be located in the most
unapproachable areas.
   In the rugged Southern Appalachian national forests, for example,
the Forest Service said it lost $8.34 million on timber sales in
fiscal 1988, an increase of $1.56 million from the previous year.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Alaska Oil Exploration Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee on Thursday approved
legislation that would allow oil exploration in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge but no drilling leases until after a
government-financed study considering alternative energy sources.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee defeated an
amendment offered by Sens. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark., that would have delayed any possibility of oil exploration
until a comprehensive energy conservation plan was submitted to
Congress by the interior secretary.
   The energy plan language the committee accepted was presented by
Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., and is identical to a compromise
included in the same legislation last session.
   While the previous bill also passed the energy committee, it
failed to get to either the House or Senate floor for a vote. The
House has not taken up the measure yet this session.
   Opponents say the United States needs to have a plan for saving
energy and finding alternatives to fossil fuel before it starts
drilling for more oil, especially in a part of the country that is
the breeding ground for one of the largest herds of migrating
caribou in North America and home to many other forms of wildlife.
   Supporters say oil exploration is necessary for national security.
   ``The closest we've come to nuclear war is in the Middle East to
protect our oil supply,'' said Hatfield.
   But he also spoke of a need for conservation, saying: ``No matter
what the actual oil find in Alaska, our national energy needs will
require the development of alternative sources of energy. ... The
spotlight trained on energy conservation efforts during the late
'70s and early '80s has suffered a blackout.''
   His amendment requires the departments of interior and energy,
the Council on Environmental Quality and the National Academy of
Sciences to prepare a national energy plan within 15 months after
the bill is enacted.
   The plan must consider all potential energy sources and projected
energy demands. Bids for oil leases could be taken while the study
was under way, but no leases could be granted until Congress had had
six months to study the report.
   The amendment also requires that the energy secretary establish a
grant program to promote research, development and marketing of
conservation techniques and alternative fuels. This program would
get its money from the sale of oil found in the refuge.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., called the Bumpers-Wirth proposal
``a killer amendment'' because it not only said oil exploration must
be delayed until the energy plan was established, but that pursuing
oil exploration would take another act of Congress.
   The American Petroleum Institute applauded the passage of the
bill, saying the refuge may provide as much as 1 million barrels of
oil to the United States every day for as long as 30 years.
   The institute said more than 6 billion barrels have been produced
at Prudhoe Bay since 1977 when drilling began there. Another 3
billion barrels are still believed to be available from Prudhoe.
   Oil companies want to start drilling at the refuge, which is just
east of Prudhoe, so that oil will continue to flow from Alaska when
the fields in Prudhoe are dry.

   Nabil Shaath, an adviser to Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat, cited remarks made this week by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and other developments.
   ``The last three days show a lot of progress _ small progress,
but important, significant progress. Many people are so skeptical
they are not even willing to see that progress.
   ``The future is going to come up with all kinds of surprises for
all of us _ happy surprises,'' Shaath told reporters at the National
Press Club.
   Baker on Tuesday told a House subcommittee that if talks between
Israel and non-PLO Palestinians do not prosper, ``I suppose we would
then have to see negotiations between Israelis and representatives
of the PLO.''
   The next day, however, he told the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations that an Israeli-PLO dialogue was
difficult to foresee but should not ``categorically'' be ruled out.
   Shaath, one of three PLO officials who attended a seminar in New
York last weekend, has been meeting with private groups in
Washington and was seeing at least two members of Congress.
   He said that he had had no contact with U.S. officials during his
visit but that he took heart from Baker's remarks.
   ``So far there has been very little substance,'' said Shaath.
   But he said that talks between the PLO and the United States
would resume March 22 in Tunis and that the PLO had been assured
U.S. Ambassador Robert H. Pelletreau would be able to discuss
substantive issues. He said these would include the Palestinians'
demands for the right to self-determination and for a Palestinian
state.
   Shaath said that President Bush had told Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in Tokyo last month that the U.S.-PLO talks in Tunis would
become substantive. ``We've had assurance in Tokyo in the meeting
that President Mubarak held with President Bush where they discussed
really nothing but the Palestinian question,'' Shaath said. ``Mr.
Bush committed himself to Mr. Mubarak then that the dialogue would
be resumed and would be made substantive, and we learn now that this
is going to be the case on the 22nd.''
   ``I think we are very close'' to U.S. recognition of the
Palestinian right to self-determination, Shaath said.
   Shaath said he wasn't discouraged by Israeli Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens' criticism of Baker's initial remarks or Arens'
hard-line rejection of talks with the PLO.
   Shaath said the Israelis would not be able to ignore the
Palestinian uprising, or ``intifadeh,'' and would have to come to
terms with Palestinian demands.
   Meanwhile, the United States, citing latest battles in Beirut,
urged the Arab League on Thursday to continue its reconciliation
attempts between Moslems and Christians in Lebanon.
   ``The United States government is deeply concerned over the heavy
exchange of shelling and consequent loss of life'' in eight days of
warfare which have left 49 people dead, said State Department
spokesman Charles Redman.
   ``We urge all sides to exercise restraint and to avoid civilian
casualties at all costs,'' he said.
   ``We call on General Aoun and Doctor Hoss to cooperate and
coordinate directly with one another, to work together to restore
and invigorate Lebanon's legitimate national institutions,'' Redman
said.
   Michel Aoun heads a Christian military Cabinet that has been
vying for legitimacy with a rival Moslem Cabinet under acting Prime
Minister Salim Hoss since President Amin Gemayel's term ended Sept.
22.
   Minutes before stepping down, Gemayel named Aoun to head an
interim military Cabinet, but his appointment was rejected by
leftists and Moslems who declared allegiance to Hoss.
   Redman said the latest fighting threatens to destroy the Arab
League's peace initiative in Lebanon.
   ``The United States actively supports this initiative and
encourages the Arab League to continue its effort,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Black Women Have Less Financial Incentive than White Women
to Marry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black women are spending twice as many years
living without a spouse than white women, at least in part because
they believe they have less financial incentive to get married or
stay married, a researcher says.
   An ongoing study of the economic and other disparities between
races determined that black women are catching up financially with
black men at a rate much faster than the pay of white women is
approaching that of white men.
   The researcher, University of Michigan sociology professor
Reynolds Farley, said one obvious reason for that is that wages paid
black men lag well behind those paid white men.
   Still, he said, black women often develop the perception it is
not in their best financial interest to get or stay married and
because of that, they are waiting longer than white women to marry
and are divorcing more frequently.
   ``Black women, when they look around and think about getting
married, see that the pool of black men with high earnings is
relatively small,'' Farley said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
``This gives them less of a financial incentive to get married or to
remain married.''
   Another reseacher, interviewed Thursday, did not dispute Farley's
finding but said the underlying factor behind it was most likely
years of wage discrimination against black men that has resulted in
black women having a longer tradition of having to work than white
women. Because of that, black women have a greater sense of
financial independence, even if their wages are lower than those
paid white women, said Phyllis Palmer, director of the women's
studies program at George Washington University.
   ``I think it's true that black men's low income affects the
marriage rate of black women,'' Palmer said. ``But it's overly
cynical to say money is the only thing that gets one married.''
   Farley said that in 1987, 30 percent of black women between the
ages of 15-44 were living with a husband, compared with 52 percent
in 1960 and 70 percent in 1950. Fifty-five percent of white women in
that age bracket were living with a husband in 1987, down from 69
percent in 1960 and 70 percent in 1950.
   Several studies have noted complaints by black women that there
is a shortage of black males in the marriage pool, but Farley said
that when numbers alone are considered, those complaints are
unfounded.
   ``There have been nearly equal numbers of black men and women
within each age group since the 1970s, so there is not an absolute
shortage of black men,'' he said. ``However, the persistently high
unemployment rate and limited earnings of black men may lead some
black women to delay marriage and, correspondingly, some black men
may hesitate to take on the financial obligations of a family.''
   Data from 1975-80 indicate that black women on average will spend
16 years of their 73-year life span with a spouse while white women
can expect to spend 33 of their expected 77 years with a mate,
Farley said.
   Higher homicide and incarceration rates among blacks likely
contribute to those numbers, Palmer said.
   Farley's data were compiled as part of a larger study he is
conducting to determine why civil rights programs designed to bring
blacks and other minorities on an equal economic footing with whites
have failed to do so.
   Working with data from the Census Bureau and other sources,
Reynolds determined that the average annual earnings of black women
and white women are close _ $13,800 for black women in 1987 and
$14,700 for white women.
   But earnings of black women are much closer to those of black
men, who made $18,500 in 1987, while white women still lag well
behind white men, who made $28,000 in 1987.
   ``Relative to the incomes of their potential mates, black women
are doing better than white women,'' Farley said.

<HEAD>Mayor Koch: `I'm A Heterosexual'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note contents of 8th graf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, who has never had trouble
speaking his mind, ignored his own vow of silence of the subject of
his sexuality and proclaimed: ``I'm a heterosexual.''
   And the mayor said Thursday he wouldn't mind if the topic boosts
the sales of his latest book, ``His Eminence and Hizzoner.''
   ``If you buy that book, you may ultimately be giving a gift to
the City of New York, in aggregate, of maybe a million dollars,''
Koch said. ``So, if I have piqued your interest, rush out and buy
the book.''
   Koch and his co-author, Cardinal John J. O'Connor, are donating
their book profits to charities.
   The flap began Wednesday night when an interviewer on WMCA radio,
discussing the difference between Koch's and O'Connor's views on
homosexuality, remarked, ``You yourself have been the subject of
innuendo.''
   ``I happen to believe that there's nothing wrong with
homosexuality. It's whatever God made you. It happens that I'm a
heterosexual,'' Koch said.
   Koch previously has said that he is not a homosexual and that he
once had a girlfriend. But he noted in the current book that he has
``been the subject of scurrilous rumors and gossip in political
campaigns.''
   In 1977, when he was running for mayor against Mario Cuomo,
posters appeared around the city which read, ``Vote for Cuomo, not
the Homo.''
   He wrote: ``So I took the public position that I would not
respond to such an inquiry ever again. People could think whatever
they wanted to. My sexuality, just like my religion, is a private
matter. I don't have to account to anyone for it.''
   At the news conference, Koch said he had forgotten ``that I had
said I would never discuss this subject again. And I never will _ as
of today.''
   When asked whether the statement was intended to remove sexual
preference as a potential campaign issue in the next mayoral
election, Koch replied, ``That happens to be wrong.'' He had no
further comment.

<HEAD>Government Shake-up Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou on Thursday
accepted the resignations of all 54 ministers in his Cabinet,
preparing for a government shake-up in a political crisis over a
bank scandal.
   The Socialist government also proposed a law allowing more
representation for smaller parties and raising the parliamentary
majority required to form a government, making governing coalitions
more likely.
   The main conservative party said the law is aimed at keeping it
out of power.
   The Cabinet reshuffle will be the second since the $200 million
fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal involving a fugitive Greek
banker broke five months ago, leading to the resignations of eight
Cabinet ministers.
   It will also be Papandreou's 16th Cabinet reshuffle in eight
years.
   Government sources indicated Papandreou intends to use the
reshuffle to purge the Socialist government of ministers implicated
in the scandal and attract waning support for his governing
Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).
   Papandreou's party has come under heavy fire for its handling of
the Bank of Crete scandal, in which Papandreou and senior government
officials have been accused of taking payoffs.
   A statement issued by government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos
said the new Cabinet would be appointed and sworn in Friday.
   The draft electoral law is to be submitted to Parliament on
Friday, and lawmakers are to vote on it within the next few weeks.
   The main conservative opposition New Democracy Party accused the
government of trying to hamper its efforts to win a clear majority
in the upcoming June elections.
   ``The government has admitted that it has ceased to contest power
and its exclusive concern is how to prevent us from acquiring an
overall majority,'' New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis said
in a statement.
   Interior Minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos said the proposed
electoral law would allow smaller parties to have more seats in the
300-member single-chamber Parliament.
   According to Kostopoulos, the premier asked his ministers to
resign in order to go ahead with the reshuffle.
   ``All the ministers have been asked and verbally submitted their
resignations,'' the spokesman said.
   Banker-publisher George Koskotas, 34, was indicted in the scandal
and fled Greece on Nov. 6. He was arrested in the United States,
where he is jailed awaiting a decision on extradition requested by
Greece.
   The banker has alleged that Papandreou and other senior Socialist
officials received millions of dollars in payoffs and authorized
plans to loot millions from the Bank of Crete while he was its
chairman.
   The draft bill proposes a new proportional system for electing
deputies and increases the margin needed to elect a government from
45 percent of the vote, the previous level, to about 48 percent, an
electoral analyst said.
   The analyst said on condition of anonymity that the new law would
open the way for coalition governments.
   Under the country's present reinforced proportional system, large
political parties are heavily favored in seat distributions.
   In the 1985 elections, the system gave PASOK 45.8 percent of the
vote and 161 seats. New Democracy received 40.8 percent and 126, the
Greek Communist Party got 9.89 percent and 12 seats, and the
Eurocommunists polled 1.84 percent and one seat.
   Political defections have left PASOK with 154, the conservatives
with 111 and the Communists with nine. The Eurocommunists retain
their one seat and the rest are independents.

<HEAD>Irish Complain Of Immigration Raids Amid St. Patrick's Hoopla</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Boston rolled out a green carpet for St.
Patrick's Day, some Irish natives were grappling with immigration
woes and a feeling that America has not been very hospitable of late.
   ``With all the Irish names and the festivities and the shamrocks
and shillelaghs, I find it ironic that Irish people are living in
the shadows here like fugitives,'' John Dillon, a spokesman for the
Irish Immigration Reform Movement, said Thursday.
   While Bostonians were preparing green beer and green bagels, the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service raided four businesses
suspected of employing illegal aliens. Ten Irish natives were
arrested on charges of being illegal immigrants.
   INS officials said Tuesday's arrests of four men at a
construction site in Hanover, N.H., and six women in a raid on a
suburban Quincy restaurant were purely coincidental and not part of
a coordinated sweep.
   ``We don't enforce the law by holiday or nationality,'' said INS
District Director Charles T. Cobb. ``It just happened.''
   But several Irish immigrants and Irish-Americans said the INS'
timing showed bad taste.
   ``It doesn't show a whole lot of sensitivity,'' said Doris
Cadigan, who emigrated from County Cork to Natick in 1971. ``Nobody
wants to be illegal... It brings out an attitude that these people
have done something wrong.''
   ``It could be interpreted as a calculated insult to the Irish
community, but I'm sure it wasn't intended that way,'' Patrick
Hurley, a founder of the IIRM, said in a telephone interview from
the group's New York office, one of 16 pushing for relaxing
immigration restrictions concerning the Irish.
   Cobb said that about 50 to 60 Irish natives were charged with
immigration law violations last year. Estimates, from the INS and
other sources, put the population of illegal immigrants in Boston at
between 15,000 and 25,000 people. U.S. Reps. Brian Donnelly,
D-Mass., and Howard Berman, D-Calif., have sponsored visa programs
that will permit 60,000 new immigrants by 1991 from 37 countries,
including Ireland, that have been under-represented in the past,
Cobb said.
   Of the 10,000 visas issued since 1986 under Donnelly's bill,
about 4,700 went to people from Ireland, he said.
   But the lawyer representing the women arrested at the Quincy
restaurant said U.S. immigration policy still favors Asians and
Central and South Americans who can claim political persecution,
while penalizing the Irish and other Europeans.
   ``The immigration laws in this country are such that the Irish
immigrants do not have an equal chance of achieving legal status,''
said George McMahon, who said his clients would aggressively fight
deportation. ``It's out-and-out discrimination.''
   Hurley called it ``hypocritical for America to be celebrating the
Irish contribution while excluding people who are continuing that
very same tradition.''
   Still, Doris Cadigan notes, that tradition and the hoopla it
inspires can be a bit bewildering to Irish natives.
   In Ireland, celebrations are quieter and less commercial, with
people wearing fresh shamrock sprigs and attending church rather
than parading and displaying plastic leprechauns, Cadigan said.
   ``When I came over first I was a little offended by it because
St. Patrick is very dear to us, because he brought us the (Catholic)
faith,'' Cadigan said. ``Now I have learned even to drink green beer
if it is offered to me.''

   Here are some key dates in the chronology of
warnings and terrorist threats surrounding the bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>1988</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   OCTOBER _ West German authorities conducting raids discover a
radio-cassette player containing plastic explosives and a barometric
timing device that could be set to detonate a bomb at a given
altitude. Thirteen alleged members of the Syrian-backed Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command guerrilla
group are arrested.
   NOV. 18 _ The date Trans World Airlines says the Federal Aviation
Administration told it of the bomb found in West Germany.
   NOV. 22 _ The British Department of Transport issues a bulletin
via telex to ``relevant security authorities'' reporting discovery
of bomb in West Germany. It now says that warning would have been
circulated by the Federal Aviation Authority to U.S. airlines and
other agencies that would need to know.
   DEC. 5 _ The U.S. Embassy in Helsinki is warned in a telephone
call of a plot to bomb a Pan Am airliner on a Frankfurt-U.S. flight
during a two-week period in December. The Federal Aviation
Administration issues an ``intelligence alert'' that there might be
a bomb attempt against a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt.
   DEC. 9 _ U.S. authorities notify the British government of the
Dec. 5 warning to the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki.
   DEC. 19 _ The British Department of Transport repeats its Nov. 22
warning, with additional details and a photo of the radio-cassette
recorder as it would look if it was wired to explode. The bulletin
is addressed to all British airports plus British and American
airlines, and El Al of Israel, Air India and South African Airways.
   DEC. 21 _ Flight 103 is destroyed over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing all 259 people aboard and 11 on the ground.
   DEC. 23 _ A British official says the government issued no public
warnings about the Dec. 5 threat made against Pan Am flights because
the information was considered confidential. British airports were
not told about the information passed on by U.S. authorities,
apparently because the threat did not specifically mention Britain.

<NOTE>1989</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   JAN. 17 _ The date Pan Am says it received a memo by mail from
the British Department of Transport dated Dec. 19.
   MAR. 15 _ The British Department of Transport first announces it
alerted airlines and airports on Dec. 19 about a possible terrorist
attack with precise details similar to the device that destroyed
Flight 103.

   He may not look like Robert Redford or

   Albano, who was in town Tuesday to promote a book for children,
has made guest appearances on ``227,'' ``Miami Vice,'' and the
``Hollywood Squares'' since retiring from professional wrestling in
1986.
   ``If you know your means, you know who you are, you don't fall in
love with yourself and think you're Laurence Olivier, there's plenty
of work if you're willing to be reasonable,'' Albano said of his
acting career.
   Albano was promoting ``Body Smasher,'' a book by Jan Stacy about
a CIA agent who goes undercover as a wrestler to battle terrorism.
Albano is a character in the book.

<HEAD>Weiss: Questions About Koop Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said Thursday he was
concerned that Surgeon General C. Everett Koop appears to have
misstated the extent of evaluation that went into Koop's decision
not to issue a report on the health effects of abortion.
   At a hearing of the Government Operations subcommittee on human
resources, Weiss and other members of the panel questioned Koop for
more than two hours, mostly about Koop's conclusion that there is
``insufficient scientific and statistical evidence on which to base
an unimpeachable report.''
   The report had been requested by former President Reagan, but in
a Jan. 9 letter to the then-president, Koop said 250 studies dealing
with the psychological aspects of abortion have been reported in
scientific literature.
   He said in the letter that ``all of these studies were reviewed
and the more significant studies were evaluated by staff in several
of the agencies of the Public Health Service ... and were found to
be flawed methodologically.
   ``In their view and mine, the data do not support the premise
that abortion does or does not cause or contribute to psychological
problems,'' his letter said.
   However, under questioning, Koop acknowledged that only a report
by a pro-life group received written evaluations by reviewers and
that all other studies referred to health service experts for review
were only discussed orally.
   ``I am disturbed by what seems to be a conclusive statement based
on evaluations of studies which turn out not to have been ...
reduced to writing, (that were) discussed orally, whatever that
means,'' said Weiss, chairman of the panel.
   Koop, who is a staunch abortion foe, said he reviewed some of the
articles himself, but he said could not detail how much time he
spent on the task. But, he said, as examples of flawed
methodologies, most of the studies looked at only a short period of
time after abortion, from three to six months.
   ``I know very well from my own experience that many of the
problems that do occur after abortions ... occur at a considerable
time after abortion,'' he said.
   ``I know that women, many times for a period that seems
inordinately long to me, have apparently no reaction adversely to
the psychological effects of abortion and then something triggers it
in their mind and they become severely depressed or anxious or
sometimes incapable of carrying on their work,'' he said.
   But Koop said scientific data is lacking on the topic.
   Pro-life groups maintain that many women who have abortions
suffer many years later from a stress disorder similar to that
suffered by Vietnam War veterans.
   Weiss also said he was concerned about allegations made by a
former Centers for Disease Control scientist who said his work at
the Public Health Service center in Atlanta was ``censored.''
   David A. Grimes, now a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
the University of Southern California School of Medicine, told the
subcommittee he left the Atlanta facility in the summer of 1986
after twice having papers he was having published ``censored''
because of their references to abortion.

   The small birthmark on newborn Faye
Watling's left cheek grew so large so fast, her parents sometimes
feared waking her in the morning for fear they'd see the deformity
had spread across her entire face.
   But Jayne and Brian Watling said doctors in the Skelmersdale,
England, area where they live warned that corrective surgery had to
wait until Faye turned 7, despite the danger that delay could
destroy the sight in her left eye.
   News about pioneering laser surgery being done in similar cases
with children at the Palo Alto Medical Clinic gave them hope for
their daughter, who turns 2 on March 24.
   And a series of heartwarming, albeit wacky, fund-raising stunts
on Faye's behalf gave them the money for the series of operations,
which climaxed on Thursday when Dr. David Apfelberg used a laser to
cut away the bulk of the orange-sized tumor, called a hemangioma.
   After surgery at Stanford University, Faye was wrapped in a head
bandage covering her face.
   ``She's dressed up like an Egyptian mummy,'' Watling said from
his daughter's side in the recovery room. ``But the growth is gone.
There's no growth there anymore.''
   And how did Faye deal with the experience?
   ``I don't think she understands too well,'' Watling said. ``All
she knows is that any time someone in white comes near her, it
hurts.''
   Additional reconstructive surgery can be done in another six
months or so, Apfelberg said, adding that ``she's always going to
have some residual.''
   Later surgery will be required to reconstruct the left side of
Faye's face and cover the scar.
   About one in every 500 to 800 children have some form of
birthmark, Apfelberg said, although 90 percent disappear by the age
of 6 to 8. The cause is unknown, he said, although it probably
occurs during the first three months of pregnancy when a fetus
develops its facial features.
   But the doctor said Faye's hemangioma, which at one point almost
completely covered her left eye, is ``one of the most severe that
we've seen.''
   British doctors lack the technology and training for the laser
procedures pioneered and developed at the Palo Alto clinic in the
1970s, Apfelberg said.
   Mrs. Watling said that when she heard about the California
techniques, she and her sister, Maureen Gledhill, immediately began
looking for ways to collect the $425,000 necesssary for the surgery
and other treatments.
   From that point, she said, things ``snowballed.''
   British sailors in the middle of the Atlantic chipped in,
long-haired women staged public head-shaving exhibitions in exchange
for donations and inmates in a local prison played 24-hour badminton
games. The prison warden had himself locked up for 24 hours, while
other officials staged a mock breakout and women prisoners gave Fay
money they had saved to buy a VCR. American Airlines donated airfare
for the family's trips to Palo Alto.
   ``If people hadn't been so generous, there was no possibility of
us coming here,'' Mrs. Watling said.
   In three other treatments, Apfelberg sealed some blood vessels to
halt tumor growth and start the shrinking process as Faye's body
began reabsorbing the cells. The operation also caused 90 percent of
the mark to change from red to a normal skin color.
   Additional treatment did more of the same, and Faye was fitted
with a pressure face mask in England that, worn 18 hours a day, also
worked to achieve the same end.
   Thursday's laser surgery had been set for mid-January, but
doctors discovered Faye was anemic and sent her home to gain
strength.

<HEAD>Helms Says Mexico Does Little to Cut Drug Trade</HEAD>

   Sen. Jesse Helms accused Mexico on Thursday of
``a dismal record'' in helping the United States battle illicit
drugs, launching a bid to deny the country any U.S. economic aid or
trade benefits.
   ``It appears that Mexico is planning to conduct business as
usual. And up to this time, Mexico has been in the business of
protecting drug kingpins,'' Helms, a North Carolina Republican.,
charged.
   Mexico is this country's top source for heroin and its No. 2
source of marijuana, according to statistics compiled by the
Department of State.
   Helms' comments came as he introduced a measure in the Senate to
remove Mexico from a list of nations granted continued U.S.
financial aid because they have been ``fully cooperating'' with the
U.S. government in its war on drugs.
   The measure is co-sponsored by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.;
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Trent Lott, R-Miss.
   Under the law, President Bush is required to formally certify
that each nation, while it may be a major drug producer or transit
point, is cooperating against the war on illicit narcotics.
   In a report accompanying the list, the State Department earlier
this month praisd Mexico for its efforts in the drug war, even
though Secretary of Sate James A. Baker III admitted that the
international war on illegal drugs was ``clearly not being won'' and
might even be ``slipping backwards.''
   The State Department cited Mexican President Carlos Salinas'
``strong public stance'' against drugs, as well as the efforts of
his new deputy attorney general. But corruption was seen as a
continuing problem.
   Last year, the Senate voted 63-27 to punish Mexico for its lack
of cooperation in the battle against drugs, but the House killed a
similar measure.
   ``I am very concerned that the entire certification process has
become a sham,'' Helms said. ``I do not accept the argument that
decertification of a non-cooperating country will hurt U.S. economic
or diplomatic interests. That is pure poppycock.''
   Helms charged that Mexico has had a ``dismal record of
non-cooperation in the drug war in the past year.''
   He faulted Mexico for, among other things, corruption at the
highest levels of government, for failing to allow overflights and
hot-pursuit actions by U.S. law enforcement aircraft, for denying
access to air surveillance flights, for denying access to bank
records to assist drug investigations and for its failure to
prosecute the principal suspects in the murder of U.S. drug agent
Enrique Camarena.

   The jury in Oliver North's trial was told
Thursday of a daring plan, said to have been approved by
then-President Reagan, that involved an air-drop of recoilless
rifles to help the Nicaraguan Contras sink arms-carrying ships.
   Whether the air drop was ever attempted was not brought out in
the fifth and last day of questioning North's former White House
boss, Robert C. McFarlane. After he left the stand, the jury was
dismissed until Monday.
   McFarlane said that although he had pleaded guilty to four
misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress he felt
he should not have been charged.
   ``I felt quite passionately about the fact that I had not
willfully lied to people,'' he said. But he added that ``it was
quite clear I withheld information'' and ``I had to accept the
consequences of what I had done.''
   Prosecutor John Keker, referring to papers introduced while
MFarlane was on the stand, said, ``What those documents show is that
during the period of the Boland Amendment you and the NSC did a lot
of things to aid the military activities of the Contras.''
   ``Yes,'' said McFarlane. The Boland Amendment, in force between
1984 and 1986 prohibited U.S. help to the guerrillas.
   The jury learned in the course of McFarlane's testimony that _
despite Boland and with North's encouragement _ money was solicited
from other countries, tactical advice was offered the Contras,
efforts were made to open a new military front in Nicaragua, plans
were drawn to shoot down Soviet-made helicopters and consideration
was given to seizing and sinking a ship carrying ammunition to the
Nicaraguan government.
   Also, McFarlane testified, Reagan approved $110 million worth of
inducements to Honduras in exchange for giving sanctuary to the
Contras and allowing military aid to pass through.
   ``All this was done because the president said `keep the Contras
together, body and soul?''' Keker asked.
   ``Yes,'' said McFarlane.
   He also replied ``yes'' when asked if people who were likely to
be called before Congress were kept ignorant of certain information
so they wouldn't have to lie under oath.
   Approval by Reagan of the air-drop plan was noted by North
co-defendant John M. Poindexter on a ``top secret'' Oct. 30, 1985,
memo drafted by North, according to a description offered in court
by the chief defense lawyer.
   As McFarlane examined the memo on the witness stand, attorney
Brendan Sullivan said that Poindexter had signed the approval line
and written ``President approved.''
   Sullivan read portions of the memo and told the jury that under
the line ``what to tell the president'' were these words: ``We
intend to air drop intelligence along with two ... recoilless rifles
which will be used to sink one or both of the arms carriers.''
   McFarlane said recoilless rifles are ``designed to knock out a
very hard target such as a tank, a bunker or a plane on the ground.''
   ``Or sink a ship as it says here,'' added Sullivan.
   Sullivan asked McFarlane: ``You understand Colonel North had the
ability to air-drop weapons and intelligence of this sort and this
was part of his job at the National Security Council?''
   ``Yes,'' McFarlane said.
   McFarlane, who was Reagan's national security adviser at the
time, said the memo did not come to him. Poindexter was then
McFarlane's deputy and later became his successor. North, a Marine
lieutenant colonel attached to the National Security Council, worked
for both men.
   North is on trial on 12 charges including lying to Congress. His
defense has been designed to convey to the jury that he had
authority for all the actions charged against him as crimes.
   Meanwhile on Thursday, Poindexter was in another courtroom for
housekeeping matters in his case. He faces trial on charges similar
to North's, and U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson said he hoped
that trial can get under way in summer or early fall, after North's
ends.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh told the judge he does not
know yet whether the government will follow its action in the North
case and drop two key charges _ conspiracy, and theft of government
property _ that are still lodged against Poindexter.
   McFarlane resigned his job as Reagan's top national security aide
on Dec. 4, 1985, although he undertook a trip to Tehran with North
the following May to press Iran for the release of Americans held
hostage in Lebanon. The trip was a failure.

<HEAD>Incomes Down Again in Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Average incomes dropped again in Latin America
last year by about 1 percent, the Inter-American Development Bank
reported Thursday.
   ``The gap in per capita income between Latin America and the
industrialized countries has grown by about one-third in the
1980s,'' the bank said in its annual report.
   Some countries did comparatively well. Chile, where the World
Bank put the average income as $1,310 in 1987, and Ecuador, where
the average had dropped to $1,040, both reported growth of 6 percent
in 1988. That left them still far behind the United States, where
the average citizen earned $18,430 in 1987, according to World Bank
figures.
   The worst drops _ more than 3 percent _ were in Guayana,
Nicaragua, Panama, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago.
   Growth was slow in the countries with the biggest economies, and
the biggest debts: Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. In Brazil, Mexico
and Peru, where three out of every five Latin Americans live,
average incomes were down.
   ``The debt overhang continues to sap the economic strength of the
region, undermining its ability to import more and invest more,''
the report said.
   Latin American countries have debts abroad of more than $400
billion dollars.
   Lower Latin American imports make for less business and fewer
jobs in the United States and other industrial countries. Lower
investment means a lower standard of living for the next generation
of Latin Americans.
   The report was issued the same day that David Mulford, assistant
secretary of the Treasury, announced the Bush administration opposes
creation of an international debt management authority as proposed
by Congress and Latin American leaders.
   He also opposed proposals that the fund use its gold or issue
``special drawing rights'' to help debtor countries, or that the
World Bank tap assets that are not now out on loan.
   Mulford leaves Friday to represent the United States in
Amsterdam, where the report will be discussed at the annual meeting
of the 44 governments in the Inter-American Development Bank.
   He is expected to announce the end of a three-year dispute
between the United States and other donor countries on one side, and
Latin American borrowers on the other, over power to delay loans by
the bank.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, then secretary of the
Treasury, asked last year for a change in the bank's voting system
to allow the United States, when it could get Canada's support, to
delay a loan for as long as two years, thus virtually killing it.
   Long negotiations gave the United States much less _ a maximum
delay of 12 months, with the need of additional votes beyond its own
and Canada's to get even that, according to informed sources who
declined to be further identified. The agreement cleared the way to
make another $22.5 billion available to the bank over the next four
years.
   The United States, which has 34.57 percent of the shares, would
supply $7.8 billion but only about $350 million would have to be
paid in.
   Last year the bank approved $1.7 billion in new loans to
modernize industry, farms and tourist enterprises, improve roads,
increase electric power, build health centers, clean up water and
treat sewage.
   The report called attention to the growth of new exports from
Latin America: soy beans, fish, fresh fruit.
   ``Exports of Chilean table grapes alone reached an estimated $500
million in 1988,'' said the report -- prepared well before the
recent discovery of cyanide in a shipment to the United States.

   Opposition politicians angrily walked out
of Parliament on Thursday over a secret report allegedly linking a
leading government aide to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's murder.
   All but one of the 93 opposition lawmakers in the 245-member
Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, decided to boycott
proceedings through Friday. They walked out after Chairman Shankar
Dayal Sharma refused to ask the government to release the report on
the 1984 slaying.
   Some of the 63 opposition members who were suspended Wednesday
from the Lok Sabha, or lower house, for demanding disclosure of the
report met with President Ramaswamy Venkataraman and urged him to
direct the government to turn over the report to Parliament.
   The government has said the report will remain classified, citing
national security interests. Parliament passed a law in July 1986,
five months after the report was completed, empowering the
government to suppress sensitive reports.
   Government sources said on condition of anonymity that the report
has been seen only by the slain leader's son and successor, Rajiv
Gandhi, and two senior Cabinet ministers who have taken an oath of
secrecy.
   The opposition's demand was first raised Tuesday after the Indian
Express, the country's largest English-language newspaper, published
excerpts from the report and sought to link a powerful government
official to Mrs. Gandhi's assassination four years ago.
   The Bombay-based newspaper quoted the inquiry as saying that
Rajendra Kumar Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi's personal secretary for more
than 20 years, had ``consciously or unconsciously ... facilitated
the commission of a crime.''
   Dhawan, 52, left the post after the assassination but was brought
back into the government last month as a key aide to the prime
minister.
   Dhawan has refused comment on the allegations, but other
government officials have said he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
   But in their memorandum to the president, opposition leaders
argued the report apparently ``contains findings adverse to Mr.
Dhawan. ... Otherwise, the question of his exoneration would not
have arisen.''
   The inquiry, ordered by the government and conducted by Supreme
Court Judge M.P. Thakkar, ran parallel to police investigations into
the assassination. It was submitted to the government in 1986.
   Opposition members in the upper house shouted slogans and pounded
on their desks Thursday, demanding the government make the report
public.
   When Sharma refused to consider the issue, opposition legislators
walked out and said they would not return this week. They then
marched to the Presidential Palace and delivered copies of Tuesday's
Indian Express to the president and demanded he order the government
to release the report.
   The Indian Express, which has a nationwide circulation of 1.1
million, is frequently critical of Rajiv Gandhi.
   Mrs. Gandhi was shot and killed by two Sikh bodyguards on Oct.
31, 1984, as she walked through the garden of her New Delhi
residence to a television interview.
   One of the guards was killed in a shootout with other guards. The
other was convicted of murder and hanged Jan. 5, along with a third
Sikh who was convicted of conspiracy.
   In its report, the Indian Express said the government report
accused Dhawan of altering the time of Mrs. Gandhi's appointment
with the television crew and that Dhawan, who was walking with Mrs.
Gandhi, fell back ``in the nick of time as they were approaching the
scene of the assassination.''
   The government has said Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an
army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine.

   A lawsuit being filed in response to the
beating death of a jail inmate could shed light on allegations that
a ``goon squad'' of corrections officers routinely beat prisoners, a
lawyer said Thursday.
   ``There's a lot of unanswered questions in that lockup,'' said
Patrick G. Patel, attorney for the family of Arnaldo Ortega. ``I'm
curious as to how they're going to answer why no medical treatment
was given to Mr. Ortega for between 16 and 18 hours.''
   Two corrections officers and a deputy warden at the Hudson County
Jail were charged Wednesday with Ortega's murder. They remained
Thursday in the Bayonne City Jail in lieu of $50,000 bail each.
   Ortega, 28, died Saturday at University Hospital in Newark. He
was brought there two days earlier in a coma, and a coroner's report
showed he was beaten about the head, arms and body.
   County Prosecutor Paul M. DePascale has acknowledged that Ortega
did not receive medical treatment for 16 hours after the three
guards allegedly beat him for about 20 minutes with a blunt object.
   DePascale said, however, that the lack of medical treatment did
not warrant criminal charges and he would not comment on the delay
in taking Ortega to the hospital.
   Patel said he filed a notice to sue at the county clerk's office
Thursday.
   State law mandates a six-month waiting period between the notice
to sue and the actual filing. Patel said he will seek to subpoena
corrections officers who had any connection with Ortega. Testimony
could help expose abuses, he said.
   The death prompted outrage in the community, where some have come
forward with stories of a ``goon squad'' that has existed for years.
   County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski said there is no evidence
that the group exists but said his office would investigate.
   ``I'm getting five or 10 calls an hour from people telling me
they know of the goon squads and that they've been beaten,'' Patel
said. ``Maybe this suit can help do something about it.''
   Omar Aziz, a Moslem chaplain at the jail for eight years, told
the Jersey Journal that inmates have repeatedly complained to him
about abuse by corrections officers, particularly during the
midnight to 8 a.m. shift.
   The targets of the beatings are usually Hispanics and blacks,
Aziz said.
   The three officers charged worked the midnight shift, DePascale
said.
   Corrections officers Thomas Murphy, 39, and David Michael Dumers,
35; and Deputy Warden Raymond Murray, 52, all of Jersey City, were
arrested after surrendering to DePascale. Murray was in charge of
the shift at the time.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Thursday it has
resumed flying arms to Afghanistan because of a guerrilla offensive
around Jalalabad, the first major battle since the Red Army
completed its withdrawal Feb. 15.
   Moslem guerrillas claimed Thursday they had shot down two more
aircraft in heavy fighting for Jalalabad, a strategic eastern city
that is the nation's third-largest. The communist government claimed
470 insurgents killed in the previous 24 hours.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Vorontsov said the airlift resumed
Wednesday, a month after the Red Army left the Kabul government to
fight the insurgents on its own.
   He said the weapons included medium-range Scud B missiles, which
are said to have been fired from Kabul at guerrilla positions around
Jalababad, 75 miles to the east and 40 miles from the Pakistan
border.
   Sources said at least 40 Ilyushin-76 transport planes had landed
at thge Kabul airport since Wednesday with military supplies and
food.
   Vorontsov accused Pakistan of sending hundreds of its own
soldiers with the guerrillas in the intense, 10-day battle for
Jalalabad.
   ``We have discussed the situation with the Pakistanis and they
know what our reaction will be if their involvement continues,'' he
said. ``We are not threatening the Pakistanis, but they must stop.''
   Pakistan supports the guerrillas, along with the United States,
but denies any of its soldiers are fighting in Afghanistan. The
Foreign Ministry called Vorontsov's allegation ``fictitious.''
   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass said Pakistani forces
were coordinating the attack on Jalalabad and forcing teen-age
refugees to take up arms.
   ``Units of Pakistani mercenaries were ordered to carry out forced
mobilization starting from age 14 in the Afghan refugee camps near
Peshawar,'' Tass in a dispatch from Kabul.
   ``Eyewitness accounts indicate that hundreds of refugee families
have decided to return to Afghanistan on learning about the order,''
it said. ``Protests against the arbitrary actions of the Pakistani
military flared up in several camps.''
   Tass said Afghan insurgents and Pakistani soldiers fired on
protesters, killing seven people and wounding 12 others.
   A separate Tass dispatch from Kabul accused Pakistani
intelligence officers of coordinating the guerrilla attack.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting in Afghanistan after a communist
coup in April 1978. Soviet military forces arrived in December 1979,
and an estimated 115,000 were in the country when the U.N.-mediated
withdrawal began May 15, 1988.
   Observers believe a guerrilla victory at Jalalabad, along the
main highway from Pakistan to Kabul, could lead to the fall of the
capital.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said insurgents downed a
helicopter gunship near Jalalabad's television station and an
airplane outside the city on Wednesday.
   The latest guerrilla claim brought to seven the number of
government aircraft reported destroyed this week in the fight for
Jalalabad.
   There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government, and it
was not possible to confirm the claims.
   Kabul radio claimed Thursday that 470 insurgents were killed in
the last 24 hours around Jalalabad, bringing the total for two days
to 1,030. Guerrillas call the Kabul claims widely exaggerated.
   It said only six of its troops were killed in the Jalalabad
fighting in the last 24 hours. It also said the guerrillas fired
``thousands of rockets and artillery shells'' into Jalalabad during
this period, killing four civilians and injuring 18.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said 25 Afghan troops were
killed and 32 captured in Jalalabad on Thursday.
   Guerrillas have overrun the city's most important garrison,
Samarkhel to the east, and were closing in on the airport.
   But Afghan soldiers retaliated with unexpectedly aggressive
aerial and artillery bombardments that reportedly have stalled the
guerrillas' progress.
   Fighting centers north, west and south of the city, according to
reports reaching Pakistan.
   Leaders of the U.S.-supported guerrillas have predicted an early
collapse of the Kabul government in the absence of its Soviet
backers, but President Najib has insisted his forces are strong
enough to survive.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Call Lujan's Comments ``Naive''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan's suggestion
that economic impact be considered when officials decide whether to
grant endangered species status was sharply criticized Thursday by
environmental groups.
   ``His comments are embarassing and naive,'' said Jay Hair,
president of the National Wildlife Federation. ``He sounds like a
kinder and gentler James Watt.''
   Brock Evans, a vice president of the National Audubon Society,
said Lujan should ``review or reconsider his remarks. I'm
disappointed and it doesn't send very good signals about President
Bush being an environmental president.''
   Lujan, in an interview with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said
the spotted owl dispute unfolding in the Pacific Northwest was a
``prime example'' of the difficulty in balancing environmental
concerns with economic impacts.
   ``I'm told, on the one hand, that I want to protect an endangered
species,'' Lujan said. ``On the other hand, I hear that's going to
devastate the entire Northwest lumber industry.
   ``How do we solve that problem? I believe we should be able to
take economic considerations into account.''
   He suggested that the Endangered Species Act be amended to make
economic impact part of the determination process.
   Under existing law, the Fish and Wildlife Service may consider
only ``biological factors'' when deciding whether to protect a
species. The Fish and Wildlife Service is part of the Interior
Department.
   ``Maybe we should change the law'' to consider economic factors,
Lujan said.
   Steven Goldstein, an Interior Department spokesman, said Thursday
that Lujan believes that while economic impact was ``not a reason to
exclude'' a species from protection, ``it is something we should
take into account when we are making that decision.
   ``We need to factor that into the equation,'' said Goldstein.
``We can't operate in a vacuum.''
   The spotted owl, which nests only in the ancient forests of the
Northwest, has become the focal point of an increasingly heated
battle over protecting old growth timber.
   Environmentalists have sought to have the owl protected as an
endangered species, but the timber industry has insisted that such a
designation could halt logging in vast areas of the Northwest and
result in the loss of thousands of jobs.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service had previously denied a request
from environmentalists that the owl be listed as endangered, but a
federal court in Seattle ordered the agency to review its decision.

   President Bush talked with the
Discovery astronauts Thursday from the Oval Office on a
television-telephone connection that let him see the spacemen.
   Here is a transcript:
   Bush: Hello.
   Discovery commander Michael L. Coats: Good morning, Mr. President.
   Bush: How are you, sir. We just called up to congratulate you and
your crew of Discovery. Sitting next to me is our vice president who
is now head of the space council and who, incidentally, will be down
in Houston in about two weeks. But what I really wanted to do is to
congratulate you and then hear about how things are going. We are
certainly proud of the mission.
   Coats: Thank you very much, sir. We have a very fine orbiter and
a very fine crew here and an awful lot of people on the ground
worked very hard to get this flight off, the first one of your
presidency, and the first one of very many to come.
   Bush: It looks to me like you made that crew clean up. I'm
watching you. I can see you sitting here in the Oval Office. Amazing
technology. There are five of you looking pretty clean and pretty
fresh. How is everyone feeling on the flight?
   Robert C. Springer: We're all feeling very well, Mr. President.
It's been an exciting time for us. Of course three of us on the
flight are rookies in space. I think the cleanliness and the smiles
you see is just a reflection of the fun that goes along with the
hard work. We're doing an awful lot of good things, but we're really
enjoying what we're doing.
   Bush: We're following it carefully and glad that the TDRS
(Tracking and Data Relay Satellite) had a successful operation
there. How's the camera? How's that IMAX camera gonna be? (IMAX is a
70mm camera used to photograph the Earth.)
   John E. Blaha: The IMAX camera has been working out really well,
sir. We're getting a lot of great film that will show a lot of
people around the world how fragile the planet Earth is in this big
vastness of space and maybe help everybody to work to improve that.
   Bush: Well, it's a good focus. There's so much interest today on
the global environment and I think a lot of people will see just
from your important mission the contribution that space exploration
can make to the world's environment. We're grateful on that. A
couple of more questions, I was interested because of the history of
this, about the student experiments and how that was going.
   James P. Bagian: Well, Mr. President, the student experiments are
going very well. Both of them are very well thought out. They have
been going just as we expected. ... The data is looking very good
and I think the students will have a lot good information to get out
when we get back. (A student experiment by John C. Vellinger of
Lafayette, Ind., studies effects of weightlessness on chicken
embryos. Another by Andrew I. Fras of Binghamton, N.Y., uses injured
rats to study the effect of space on healing bones.)
   Bush: It is an inspiration to the Americans, I'll tell you, all
of us. Today's pioneers. We're seeing you right now pointing the way
for the young Americans to build our nation's future. Listen, all of
you down there at NASA, I heard what Mike said, and while we're on
the air to space, let me say to everyone at NASA that you have our
strong support. I know I speak for the vice president. The space
program, especially space station Freedom, is an investment in our
future. We living in a tough budgetary times, but I am determined to
go forward with a strong active space program. And I want to
congratulate you commander Coats and all of them for this wonderful,
wonderful mission. We look forward to your safe return. And I think
it wonderful that two Marines can get along with a guy from the Navy
and the Air Force and a civilian. That shows a broad minded approach
to life in space. Did you read that?
   James F. Buchli: Yes sir, we did. Obviously the Marines can get
along with the other services, but just in case, we have them
outnumbered. There's two of us on board. (Buchli and Springer are
Marine colonels. Coats is a Navy captain, Blaha an Air Force
colonel, and Bagian is a civilian physician.)
   Bush: (Laughing) I got the message. Sorry to start it going up
there. But listen, congratulations and best wishes. You've been an
inspiration to all of us. So long and God bless.
   Coats: Thank you, Mr. President, and give our regards to Mrs.
Bush. Tell her we are flying something for the new first lady.
   Bush: She'll be thrilled. You better come up here and give it to
her personally.
   Coats: That would be nice, sir.
   Bush: You're in. You're invited right as of now. So when you get
back, head this way. Over and out.
   Coats: Yes sir. Have a good day.

<HEAD>Metzenbaum: Corporations Shouldn't Make Older Workers Sign Away Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older workers have been coerced into signing
away their rights as corporations try to get rid of better-paid
employees in favor of younger, lower-paid newcomers, three early
retirees told a Senate hearing Thursday.
   ``It is difficult for me to believe that an employee who works in
America today ... who has been a loyal and successful worker for one
employer for a long time, can be fired from his or her job and
forced to sign away their rights under the law,'' said Kenneth
Lancaster of St. Paul, Minn.
   ``If I had known more about the equal rights laws, and had known
on Dec. 31, 1983 that my replacement was 28 years old, I would not
have signed anything,'' he told the Senate Subcommittee on Labor.
   The subcommittee, headed by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is
considering Metzenbaum-sponsored legislation to forbid employers
from asking older workers to waive their rights under the law as a
condition of taking advantage of early retirement incentives.
   ``Three-fourths of employers don't use waivers. Why do the other
25 percent have to?'' Metzenbaum said.
   A General Accounting Office survey of 60 ``Fortune 100''
companies showed 24 percent of the companies that had early
retirement incentives required workers to sign waivers in order to
get beefed-up benefits. The use of waivers has tripled over the past
10 years, the GAO's Joseph Delfico told the committee.
   The chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission told
the panel no new law is needed because of regulatory action taken in
1987 aimed at accomplishing the same goal.
   But the GAO survey showed 1987-88 was a peak period for the use
of waivers.
   The companies surveyed by GAO, the investigative arm of Congress,
reported they used the waivers ``to avoid having terminated
employees file claims and lawsuits after receiving enhanced benefits
from exit incentive programs,'' Delfico testified.
   Lancaster said he was one year from being vested in his pension
plan when the car dealership for which he was service manager fired
him after 12 years on the job. In a New Year's Eve meeting, the
dealership offered six months' severance pay in exchange for a
signature on a release of all claims, Lancaster said.
   ``I was given no reason for my termination. They had already
hired someon in my place,'' Lancaster told the panel. ``I was told I
had to sign the release letter immediately in order to get the
severance pay.
   ``I asked to take the documents home to review them, but they
said no. I asked for time to talk to an attorney, but they said I
didn't need to because the dealership's lawyers had already gone
over everything,'' he said.
   Robert Patterson, a draftsman, said he was told by his manager at
Xerox Corp. there was a ``99 percent sure chance you will be laid
off'' if an early retirement offer was refused.
   ``I had only seven working days to make a decision,'' Patterson
said.
   Gerald Clay of Peoria, Ill., said he was offered a year's salary
if he signed documents waiving his rights under the Age
Discrimination Employment Act.
   ``What happened to me shouldn't happen to anybody,'' he said.
   A law partner in a national firm testified that Metzenbaum's
proposal could hurt companies that haven't discriminated.
   ``The real effect of (the bill) in individual cases would be to
create a system whereby disputes could not be settled without the
intervention of EEOC or a court, and would put an end to many
internal company grievance programs that have been developed over
the years to deal with employee complaints,'' said attorney Cathie
A. Shattuck, who's represented both employers and disgruntled
employees.

<HEAD>Non-Profit Group For Terminally Ill Children Closes Office Amid Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who founded a national group that
grants wishes of dying children has closed an office and dropped
from sight, raising questions about the status of the charity and
the way she handled donations.
   Better Business Bureau officials say they haven't spoken with
Mary Girardin since December, shortly before she closed the two-room
offices of A Child's Wish Come True Inc.
   ``I don't know where she is,'' said Barbara Sinnott, president of
the Better Business Bureau of Central New England.
   In 1985, the last year the charity filed financial statements
with the state, the group reported it took in $400,000 but gave only
one-third of the money to terminally ill children, Sinnott said. The
BBB recommends that 60 percent of revenues should go to the stated
purpose of the charity.
   ``We have just consistently reported that it has not measured up
to the recommended amount of giving,'' she said.
   Girardin apparently has disconnected her telephone in Worcester
and could not be reached for comment by The Associated Press on
Thursday.
   Sinnott said she sent three letters to Girardin asking for
updated information on the organization but never received the
information.
   The group has in the past sponsored trips for ill children to
Disneyworld.
   Several groups such as A Child's Wish Come True have sprung up in
the past decade. While most of the groups are legitimate, the
powerful fund-raising appeal of brightening a dying child's last
days has posed some problems, charity officials said.
   ``Unfortunately, people have very open hearts and when you have a
cause that sounds good and they get any kind of good publicity and
people don't check, then they tend to open their wallets,'' Sinnott
said.
   In Pennsylvania, a group called the Sunshine Foundation was
investigated by the state attorney general's office, which
criticized the foundation's handling of $34,000 in fund money.
   No charges were filed, but a new executive director was selected
for the charity after a meeting between the foundation's board of
directors and state officials.
   ``They're making progress towards bringing their accounting
procedures in line with those of a responsible, not-for-profit
corporation,'' Deputy Attorney General Mollie McCurdy said.
   In Texas, the attorney general's office filed a civil suit in
1986 against a group called Rainbow Foundation, after an
investigation showed little of the money raised went to children,
said Rose Ann Reeser, deputy attorney general in charge of the
charitable organizations division.
   ``The problem that we have with those organizations, as with a
lot of organizations like this, (is) you can't track down your
money,'' Reeser said. ``Anytime you deal with a dying child, it's a
very compelling thing.''
   The suit against Rainbow Foundation was dismissed after its
founder died, Reeser said.

<HEAD>House Panel Heads Study Idea of Shipping U.S. Meat to Commissaries
in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If European countries don't end a ban on
America's hormone-treated beef, U.S. military commissaries there
could stop buying Europe's meat, two House committee chairmen said
Thursday.
   Reps. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the Agriculture
Committee, and Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, said they are looking into the idea of shipping U.S. beef
and dairy products to the 131 U.S. commissaries on military bases in
Europe instead of letting them buy European products.
   ``The United States shouldn't be buying from European sources
while the Europeans are closing their markets to our products,''
said de la Garza. ``The armed services and agriculture committees
will take up this matter at a hearing this spring,'' he added.
   Aspin said it may be more practical now than in the past to ship
U.S. beef and other products to Europe in light of a decline in the
value of the dollar.
   ``The committees will be examining the transportation system,
pricing and funding for shipment of these products,'' said de la
Garza.
   The European Community has been refusing to accept meat from
livestock treated with growth hormones, while U.S. officials say the
meat is not dangerous to humans.
   Last year, military commissaries sold 46 million pounds of
European beef for $55 million, said Aspin and de la Garza. Before
the European ban on hormone-treated beef, the United States was
selling about $100 million worth of beef in Europe.

<HEAD>Senate Won't Drop Impechment Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate refused Thursday to dismiss
impeachment charges that federal District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami conspired to get a $150,000 bribe and later lied about it at
his trial.
   The Senate voted 92-1 against dismissal of 15 of the 17 articles
of impeachment against the 52-year-old Miami judge. The lawmakers
then voted 93-0 against dismissal of another article.
   Hastings had not sought dismissal of still another charge, that
he disclosed information obtained from a federal wiretap and thus
torpedoed a federal investigation of Miami-area corruption.
   The Senate acted after 2{ hours of deliberation on the
52-year-old judge's move for dismissal of the charges on grounds
that he had been acquitted in a 1983 trial and could not get a fair
hearing in the Senate now in any case because too much time has
passed.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, voted in favor of dismissal on
the first of Hastings' two motions, which would have dropped the
first 15 of the articles of impeachment.
   Metzenbaum was not reached immediately for comment, but press
secretary Nancy Coffey said the senator had constitutional qualms
about an impeachment trial on charges of which Hastings already had
been acquitted.
   ``Those were the counts on which he was acquitted and the senator
had constitutional concerns about double jeopardy,'' Coffey said.
   The Senate's decision sets the stage for an impeachment trial
expected to take as much as six weeks before a special Senate
committee.
   The panel's proceedings are to be videotaped for viewing by
senators who lack time to sit through the lengthy presentation of
evidence. The case then will come back to the Senate floor for a
vote on whether to remove Hastings from the bench and take away his
$89,500 annual salary.
   Hastings himself on Wednesday took the Senate floor to make a
personal appeal to the lawmakers to drop charges that he plotted to
obtain the payoff and then committed perjury to win his 1983
acquittal.
   ``I proclaimed my innocence then as I have from the outset and as
I do now,'' Hastings told the lawmakers.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, one of a panel of House prosecutors,
told the Senate however that the judge's double-jeopardy defense did
not apply to impeachment trials and that Hastings should forfeit his
job because of ``his inexcusable breaches of the public trust.''
   In contrast, the senators deliberated behind closed doors on
Thursday and voted on Hastings' dismissal motion without any public
debate.
   Hastings stands accused of conspiring with Washington attorney
William Borders in 1981 to reduce from three-year prison sentences
to probation the punishment of two brothers, Frank and Tom Romano of
Miami. They were convicted in Hastings' court of skimming from a
Teamsters union pension fund loan.
   In return, Hastings and Borders were to receive $150,000.
   The Romano brothers, both of whom have since died, refused to pay
any bribe, but the FBI mounted a sting-type operation and arrested
Borders pulling out of a suburban Virginia motel with a garment bag
containing $125,000 handed to him by an undercover agent
masquerading as Frank Romano.
   Borders was convicted of conspiracy and went to prison.
   The House voted the articles of impeachment 413-3 on Aug. 3.

<HEAD>Palm Sunday Procession Is Canceled in Jerusalem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditional Palm Sunday procession in
Jerusalem was canceled on Thursday because of the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   On the political front, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman
said Thursday that Shamir has been holding secret meetings with
Palestinian leaders who do not belong to the PLO. Spokesman Avi
Pazner confirmed a report on Israel TV that such meetings were under
way.
   Israeli Arab leaders meanwhile called for a general strike by
Israel's 810,000 Arab residents on March 30 to support the
rebellion, which has killed at least 396 Palestinians and 17
Israelis since it began on Dec. 8, 1987.
   Violence continued Thursday, with 40 Palestinians reported
injured in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, most of them
beaten by Israeli soldiers. The territories have been under Israeli
control since the 1967 Middle East war.
   A spokesman for Father Michel Sabbah, the first Arab Catholic
patriarch of Jerusalem, said the Palm Sunday parade was called off
this year, as it was last year, ``because it is not possible to have
it with all the schools closed.''
   Schools in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been closed since
last year by Israel, which considers them flashpoints for the
uprising.
   Schoolchildren traditionally march in the parade, which
commemorates Jesus' triumphal entrance into Jerusalem amid waving
palm fronds borne by his disciples.
   ``In the churches, everything will be held as usual,'' said the
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers destroyed three Palestinian homes and
sealed two others to punish anti-Israeli activists.
   That touched off demonstrations in which Palestinian youths
burned tires, raised outlawed Palestinian flags and hurled rocks at
troops, Arab reports said.
   Soldiers opened fire at several protests, and one 16-year-old
Palestinian was reported wounded. Ahli Arab and Shifa hospitals in
Gaza City reported treating 35 Palestinians for beating injuries.
   The dynamited homes belonged to Palestinians arrested this month
for allegedly belonging to an assassination team linked to Palestine
Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat, the army said.
   Three West Bank Palestinians were shot and wounded in
stone-throwing clashes with soldiers, including two teen-agers shot
in the legs in Kabatiya, Arab reports said.
   A Palestinian shop in Nablus and one in Ramallah were set ablaze
by fellow Palestinians for selling Israeli-made goods, police said.
No injuries were reported.
   Leaders of the uprising have repeatedly called on store owners to
boycott Israeli goods.
   In Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, troops late Wednesday
night bulldozed the home of Ibrahim Abu Mor, a Palestinian lawyer
wanted by Israeli authorities for allegedly heading Islamic Jihad, a
fundamentalist Moslem group, the army said.
   The United States objects to the destruction of homes as undue
punishment, especially when the activists have not been tried in
court.
   The strike call to Israeli Arabs was issued at a meeting in
Shaferam. Arab Israeli leaders said businesses will be closed and
rallies will be held on March 30 ``to protest against Israeli
government discrimination against Arab citizens and to show
solidarity with the people in the occupied territories.''
   The March 30 date commemorates a 1976 incident in which six Arabs
were killed in the Galilee in clashes over land expropriations by
Israel.
   Pazner meanwhile told The Associated Press Thursday that Shamir's
meetings with Palestinians started last December.
   ``Its purpose is to have a dialogue with non-PLO Palestinians. He
has been meeting with non-PLO Palestinians, and he will continue to
do so,'' Pazner said.
   He declined to identify the Palestinians, saying ``it could
endanger their lives.''
   His disclosure came a day after Shamir's foreign minister, Moshe
Arens, reacted strongly and negatively to suggestions by U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III that Israel consider talks
directly with the PLO if other peace avenues fail.
   Arens is in the United States in advance of an expected April
trip by Shamir.

   The Communist Party approved sweeping agricultural
reforms Thursday, giving farmers long leases on state land to
produce more of the meat, fruit and fresh vegetables for which
housewives now wait in line for hours.
   An average Soviet citizen now consumes about half as much meat
and fruit as an American, but up to double the sugar and potatoes.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, the ruling Politburo's man in charge of farm
policy, promised the people diets ``up to generally recognized
standards of nutrition'' by 1996.
   ``We are not promising something that we cannot achieve,'' he
told his first news conference with foreign reporters. ``We will be
able to change the food situation for the better.''
   The meeting of the 300-member Central Committee also elected the
party's 100 members to the Congress of People's Deputies, a new
2,550-seat legislative body that will meet for the first time in the
spring. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was among them.
   Gorbachev had proposed that farmers be given long-term leases on
land so they would become more efficient. He also urged that they be
allowed to decide what to plant on the land rather than having the
bureaucracy decide.
   Western analysts have said the new system will do little good
unless lease-holders are allowed to choose which crops to plant, set
their own prices and make other decisions.
   Ligachev said leases could be signed for any period of more than
five years and be passed on succeeding generations of a family. He
said no one would be forced to lease land and that the giant state
and collective farms would remain the backbone of the Soviet
agricultural system.
   ``Radical changes in rural life and production relations should
be carried out on a purely voluntary basis ... without any kind of
force or repressive methods,'' said Ligachev, 68, who is widely
regarded as a conservative force in the Politburo.
   Setting targets for leasing would only encourage strong-arm
tactics to fulfill the plans, he said.
   In statements at the meeting, leasing was only one of many
methods for improving production. He said the new approach to
agriculture also would include self-financing, and greater democracy
in rural life.
   State and collective farms still will dominate agriculture, he
said. Some Soviet press reports have come close to advocating they
be scrapped, but Ligachev said none of the 12 Politburo members
favor it.
   ``Any proposal that leads to abolishing state and collective
farms has no foundation whatsoever,'' he declared.
   Even when land is leased to individuals and groups, he said,
state and collective farms will oversee production, ``proceeding
from the needs and possibilities of society.''
   Soviet television showed an hour-long report on the meeting,
including speeches by local and Moscow-based officials echoing
Gorbachev's calls for agriculture.
   The meeting abolished the giant superministry in charge of
agricultural policy, and Gorbachev interrupted its chief, Vsevolod
Murakovsky, who favored the traditional system in which all local
regions are required to send a percentage of their harvest to
central authorities.
   The television, breaking with its ususal practice, cut off its
report before Gorbachev gave his final statement to the plenum.
Ususally Gorbachev's statements in televised forums constitute the
main part of the TV report.
   In a nearly two-hour speech Wednesday, Gorbachev painted a
devastating picture of Soviet agriculture, with chemically spoiled
land, investments gone sour and destruction of systems prevalent in
the 1920s.
   He said food shortages were inadmissible. ``The shortage of food
creates social tension and generates not merely criticism but actual
discontent.''
   He said conditions in villages in some regions were so bad that
emigration to the cities had reached a ``critical level.''
   When Josef Stalin forced agricultural collectivization in the
1930s on a populace that was 80 percent agrarian, millions of
peasants were deported to Siberia and other remote regions or fled
to cities. Catastrophic famine ensued.
   Ever since, farmers working for state-owned farms have generally
delivered their yields to market at fixed prices to meet quotas set
by the state bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Quayle Says He's No Spiro Agnew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Thursday that
despite his sometimes harsh rhetoric _ which has contrasted with
President Bush's _ he is not a lightning rod for Bush as Spiro Agnew
was for President Nixon.
   Playing on a memorable campaign exchange between himself and
Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle said he
had asked Bush about the Agnew comparison, made by more than one
Quayle watcher.
   Bush paraphrased Bentsen's line during last fall's vice
presidential debate attacking Quayle for comparing himself to John
F. Kennedy, Quayle said in a quip that drew appreciative laughter
from his audience at the National Press Club.
   ``He put his hand on my shoulder. He said, `Dan, I knew Spiro
Agnew. Spiro Agnew was a friend of mine, and you're no Spiro
Agnew,''' Quayle said.
   But Quayle reiterated his attack on the Senate for its rejection
of Bush's defense secretary nominee, John Tower, saying that ``smear
information'' was used.
   Last week, Quayle went further, saying in an Indianapolis speech
that the Senate's rejection of Tower signaled a legislative attack
on the power of the presidency and a return to the tactics of the
McCarthy era.
   Bush's own rhetoric about his first major defeat in Congress
since becoming president was decidedly milder. Bush said the episode
was ``history'' and he wanted to move forward with good relations.
   Quayle said that when he made the accusation in Indianapolis, he
was not performing the Agnew tough-guy role to Bush's nice guy.
Agnew drew fire with his pungent speeches that often criticizing the
media and liberals in general.
   But Quayle said senators who knew Tower and had served with him
relied on other witnesses and unsubstantiated rumors instead of
their own knowledge of the man. And he offered another theory about
Tower's defeat.
   ``I do believe we're starting to set a new standard. What brought
down John Tower was probably more on the likeability issue, that he
simply was not well-liked. I don't believe that is a criteria to be
used for whether the president ought to have the right to have his
person as secretary of defense.''
   Quayle also defended the new administration's pace, which has
been criticized as too slow.
   ``We're succeeding an administration of our own party at a time
when the country is in good shape ... so we're certainly not going
to be stampeded into doing things for the sake of doing them soon,
or quickly, or to show `momentum' or some such thing.''
   ``Quick fixes are often bad fixes,'' Quayle added.
   Quayle also criticized politicians' ``frantic efforts to gain
press attention,'' but said he was not referring to the media-wise
campaign that elected him and Bush last fall.
   He said the political process is distorted when ``the need to
make the 7 o'clock news can lead politicians to announce initiatives
that really aren't well thought out _ initiatives that might well
make the headlines, but might not be very good for the health of the
country.''
   Asked about the Bush-Quayle campaign's acknowledged management of
the daily news, packaging events and keeping the candidates away
from reporters to keep from cluttering the canned message, Quayle
said he was not talking about campaigns but added: ``You've got a
certain message you want to get across.''
   In his speech, Quayle said he was criticizing ``the way frantic
efforts to gain press attention and produce sound bites can distort
our political process by elevating form over substance, and image
over reality.''
   As to the blistering press reports about his own background that
percolated throughout the campaign, the vice president said he
probably benefited from it in the long run. He said the intense
scrutiny was to be expected because he had been a little-known
senator outside his home state of Indiana when Bush picked him for a
running mate.
   ``You're an open target to criticism by your opposition. That is
the way we conduct our campaigns,'' he said. ``It's healthy to see
how one musters the scrutiny. I believe I have emerged a stronger
and better person because of it. It's an experience that had a
meaningful purpose for me as being the vice president of the United
States.''

   Moslem gunners blasted Beirut's port
Thursday, setting a cargo ship and a warehouse afire in fierce
battles with Christian forces around the capital. No casualties were
reported.
   Artillery duels in Beirut and in the mountains above the capital
coincided with a nationwide strike staged by Moslems to mourn
victims of the previous week of fighting, which police said left 49
people killed and 161 wounded.
   A Syrian official was quoted as saying an Arab League committee
has canceled a third meeting between rival Moslem and Christian
Cabinets to end the violence.
   A police spokesman said Moslem gunners blasted the Beirut port
with 25 rockets, setting fire to a cargo ship that tried to return
from open waters during a lull in the fighting.
   The spokesman identified the stricken vessel as ``The Angie
Wipp'' and said he could not give any details about its flag, owners
or what kind of cargo it carried.
   One of the port's warehouses also took a direct rocket hit during
the attacks, said the spokesman, who cannot be further identified
under standing regulations.
   Christian gunners fired a barrage of 155mm howitzer fire at the
Moslem residential districts of Sabra and Kasskass abutting Beirut's
dividing Green Line, said a police spokesman.
   Sniper fire and occasional grenade blasts crackled across the
ruins of the old commercial district.
   The police spokesman said the new hostilities in Souk el-Gharb,
15 miles southeast of Beirut, erupted shortly before sundown between
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's forces, which hold the
town, and Druse fighters on nearby hills.
   The town commands a network of mountain roads leading from Druse
territory to the Christian heartland north and northeast of the
capital.
   Aoun's forces appeared to be following through with his stated
intention to drive Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon. Militiamen
of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party are
backed by Syria.
   The Christian-run Ad-Diyar newspaper on Thursday quoted an
unidentifed Syrian official as saying that Damascus ``has not yet
taken a decision to retaliate against Gen. Aoun ... But if Aoun
should continue his provocations, retaliation will be decisive.''
   The official was quoted as saying Arab League peace talks will
not be held. The fighting was sparked by a March 6 air-and-sea
blockade Aoun clamped on illegal harbors run by Moslem militias
south of Beirut.
   The blockade angered Jumblatt, whose party runs two illegal port
facilities. Jumblatt vowed to bombard the Christian-run Beirut port
as long as the blockade of Druse harbors was maintained.
   Lebanon's commerical sea traffic was virtually halted and Beirut
International Airport, the nation's only air gateway, has been shut
since Saturday.
   Aoun, 53, heads the Christian cabinet that has been vying for
legitimacy with acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss' Moslem cabinet.
   The rival governments have been in place since Parliament failed
to elect a successor to President Amin Gemayel when his term ended
in September.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Utah Must Allow Sweat Lodges For Indian Inmates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A two-year legal battle over the state's
refusal to allow ceremonial sweat lodges for Indian inmates at Utah
State Prison ended Thursday when a federal judge ruled the ban is
unconstitutional.
   Applause broke out in the packed courtroom and American Indians
from several different tribes chanted and pounded drums outside
after U.S. District Judge J. Thomas Greene struck down the ban in a
bench ruling on motions for summary judgment.
   ``I'm grateful. The words are kind of hard to come by at this
time because the feeling is so good,'' said George A. Roybal, an
Assiniboine Sioux who, as a Utah prison inmate in March 1987,
initiated the lawsuit with five other inmates.
   ``What this thing is all about is us trying to help our people to
help themselves,'' he said.
   The Utah Department of Corrections had contended the sweat lodge,
which tribal officials contend is central to purification and
ceremonial rites dating back 40,000 years, threatened security
because the lodge must be dark and enclosed.
   But Greene cited two U.S. Supreme Court rulings and the success
of sweat lodges in 19 other state prison systems and two federal
penitentiaries in rejecting arguments that the small willow and
canvas structures posed a security risk.
   The judge said the prohibition was unreasonable and resulted in
``the Native American religion not being accommodated to the extent
other religions are.''
   ``The sweat lodge will simply be another chapel located within
the prison,'' Greene said.
   Michael O'Brien, an attorney representing the American Civil
Liberties Union, said guards could monitor ceremonies and prison
officials could impose limitations such as searches and requirements
that the lodge be dismantled after each service.
   ``The record is clear that 19 other states and the federal prison
system accommodate these sweat lodges without risk to security,''
O'Brien said.
   Telephone messages left at the office of Joseph Tesch, the
associate Utah attorney general who defended the case for the state,
were not immediately returned.
   The ACLU was one of several groups that provided legal or moral
support to the inmates' cause. The Native American Rights Fund and
the giant Navajo Nation also joined the plaintiffs in the lawsuit,
while the Central Salt Lake City Council of Churches, representing
pastors from six denominations, urged Gov. Norm Bangerter to
intervene on the inmates' behalf.
   Prison officials had earlier offered to allow a modified sweat
lodge equipped with a window and mechanical heating, instead of the
required heated rocks, but plaintiffs' attorney Danny Quintana
called the suggestion ``blasphemous.''
   Greene concurred, telling Associate Utah Attorney General Joseph
Tesch, at one point, ``It's like saying to a Christian you can have
a ceremony but don't mention Christ.''
   Attorneys for the Navajo Nation, which manages sweat lodge
programs for 500 inmates in federal and state systems, argued that
the ceremonies are vital to rehabilitation.
   The sweat lodge provides a link between the incarcerated Indian
inmate and his tribe, and the program administered by the Navajos
offers drug and alcohol counseling in addition to spiritual
guidance, said Navajo lawyer Lee Bergen.

   Gusty winds blew across much of the nation Thursday with dust and
sand swirling up to 60 mph in Nevada.
   Southwest winds over the Central Plains blew up to 43 mph at
Russell, Kan., Thursday morning with visibilities briefly as low as
4 miles in blowing dust.
   Northeast winds were behind a cold front over southern portions
of Nebraska and Iowa, and northwest winds of around 30 mph prevailed
over northern portions of Wisconsin and Michigan behind the same
cold front.
   Strong southwest winds caused widespread blowing dust and sand in
central and southern Nevada. At Lovelock winds hit 60 mph and
visibilities lowered to an eighth of a mile.
   Rain continued in the Pacific Northwest and into central
California.
   Snow fell in the mountains of the far West. Six inches was
reported in the higher elevations near Lake Tahoe Thursday morning
with blizzard conditions anticipated over some of the mountain
passes.
   Snow also fell in portions of the northern Rockies and northern
portions of Wisconsin and Michigan.
   Thunderstorms were reported over southeast Georgia, southern
Alabama and the Florida Panhandle. Hail accompanied a thunderstorm
near Mobile Ala., and thunderstorms brought heavy rain to the
Florida Keys.
   There was a sharp contrast in temperatures over the Great Plains
states. Early afternoon readings were in the single digits over
northern Minnesota and in the teens over much of the northern
Plains, but were in the 60s and 70s over the southern Plains.
   In southeast Nebraska at 2 p.m. EST it was 62 degrees in Falls
City while in Omaha, 90 miles to the north, it was 37 degrees.
   Skies were mostly sunny over the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast states. Temperatures ranged from the 30s and 40s over New
England to around 60 degrees in central Virginia.
   The low in the nation was 10 degrees below zero at Escanaba, Mich.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 5
degrees above zero at International Falls and Warroad, Minn., to 87
degrees at Jacksonville, Fla.
   The forecast for Friday called for scattered snow from the upper
Great Lakes across Minnesota and the Dakotas to the northern
Rockies. Rain was expected over the West Coast and northern and
central portions of the Plateau region. Scattered thunderstorms were
expected in southern Florida, western Texas and the middle
Mississippi and lower Tennessee valleys. Rainshowers were forecast
from Illinois to western New York state.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 20s and 30s from the
northern Rockies across the northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley to Michigan with teens near the Canadian border. Highs in the
30s were expected for northern New England. Highs in the 60s and 70s
were forecast from southern California across central Arizona, for
much of Colorado, New Mexico, the central Plains and the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the middle and south Atlantic Coast states.
Readings were expected to climb to the 80s from the desert Southwest
to much of western and southern Texas and from the central Gulf
Coast region to Florida. Highs elsewhere were expected in the 40s
and 50s.

<HEAD>Sales Of Non-Chilean Fruit Dip In Some Places; Consumers Called More
Careful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The scare over tampering of fresh fruit from Chile has reduced
sales of all fruit at some markets, but others reported Thursday
that consumers are asking more questions but not cutting back much
on their shopping lists.
   ``Consumers definitely don't want any fruit from Chile and we
don't offer any fruit from Chile. They pick up apples from
Washington and ask if they're from Chile,'' said David Sneddon,
co-owner of Fairway, a large New York City fruit market.
   On Monday, the United States urged consumers not to eat Chilean
fruit after two grapes imported from Chile were found to be tainted
with a small amount of cyanide. Most Chilean fruit was pulled from
U.S. market shelves.
   The finding of the tainted fruit followed anonymous calls to the
U.S. embassy in Santiago earlier this month from a man who
threatened to inject cyanide into Chile's export fruit.
   Officials had concluded the first call was apparently a hoax
after precautionary inspections revealed no sign of tampering. But
when a second call was received March 8, saying the threat was not a
hoax, further inspections turned up two tainted, seedless red grapes
in Philadelphia on Sunday.
   Unlike some other grocers, Brian Johnson, produce manager at the
Byerly's grocery store in Edina, Minn., said he had seen a drop in
fruit sales, even types that are not grown in Chile.
   ``I've noticed some melon sales slowing down even though they
aren't even from Chile, and even with bananas, which was a real
shocker since they are grown nowhere near Chile,'' he said. ``This
has created a certain air of uncertainty about buying fruit.''
   ``Sales have slowed down quite a bit,'' Johnson said, adding that
a drop in fruit sales was particularly important to grocers because
of the jump of interest in fresh fruit recent years as consumers
have become more health-conscious.
   In New York, Sneddon said consumers were still buying fruit ``as
long as we confirm for them it's not from Chile.'' He estimated that
overall his business is down only about ``five thousand bucks or
something like that.''
   At Balducci's, an upscale specialty market in New York's
Greenwich Village, produce department manager Gino Roselli said his
business was off about 10 percent, but he said that was due mainly
to higher prices for fruit from sources other than Chile, not to a
general fear of tampering.
   Mary Ellen Gowin, vice president for consumer and public affairs
at Shop Rite, a national chain based in New Jersey, said Chilean
fruit accounts for about 15 percent of the chain's fruit sales at
this time of year, so ``we still have 85 percent to work with.''
   ``People are very cautious and concerned,'' she said. ``We
recognize that.'' The company has posted signs in produce
departments and is displaying shipping containers showing the
fruits' country of origin, she said, and sales of non-Chilean
products are holding up well.
   ``Consumers like fruit and will substitute. They are very
understanding,'' she said.
   Mike DeMay, co-owner of Tait's Super Valu in Des Moines, said the
reaction to the Chilean threat could invite more of the same.
   ``The next guy will do it to bananas or lettuce,'' he said. ``But
the biggest part of the problem is that the customers' confidence is
going to be further eroded in their belief in our food safety
system.''
   Mike Loffredo, vice president of Loffredo Fresh Produce Inc., a
Des Moines food wholesaler, questioned whether officials overreacted.
   ``It's just been blown out of proportion,'' Loffredo said.
   Fruits imported from Chile include grapes, nectarines, peaches,
plums, apricots, pears, Granny Smith apples, cherries, raspberries,
blueberries, cantaloupe and honeydew melons. Substitute sources are
available for most types of fruit except for grapes, virtually all
of which come from Chile at this time of year.

<HEAD>Economic Reformer Becomes Premier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ante Markovic took office as premier
Thursday and promised market-oriented reforms to rescue Yugoslavia
from an economic decline that began with the death of President Tito
in 1980.
   Markovic, a successful businessman, said in his inaugural speech
a free-market economy is the ``ultimate achievement of mankind, for
which no alternative has yet been found.''
   He also said ``there is no solution to the economic crisis
without the strengthening of political democracy in the country,''
and advocated creation of ``a new modern socialist system.''
   A new Cabinet, much trimmer than before, also was sworn in.
Markovic's government has 19 ministers, compared to 29 under Branko
Mikulic, who resigned Dec. 30 because his government could not
resolve the economic crisis.
   This Balkan nation of 23 million must undergo ``fundamental
change'' in order achieve economic revival, Markovic said.
   Inflation has reached an annual rate of 346 percent, and
Yugoslavia owes $21 billion to foreign creditors. Labor unrest and
ethnic conflict have become chronic.
   Much of the recent ethnic trouble has involved the southern
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form a majority of 90
percent. About 2,000 Albanian miners have been on strike in Kosovo
for nearly a month.
   The government raised the prices of gasoline and diesel fuel
Thursday for the third time this year, by an average of 18.7
percent, the official news agency Tanjug reported.
   Yugoslavs, whose average monthly pay is equivalent to $120, now
must pay about $1.82 a gallon for gasoline.
   Markovic indicated he would seek closer links to the West,
including greater economic cooperation with the European Economic
Community.
   He advocates reshaping the banking system along Western lines,
creating a stock market and ending state subsidies to companies that
lose money.
   Yugoslavia left the Soviet bloc in 1948 and is a founding member
of the organization of nations that profess non-alignment.
   Mikulic's government was the first to resign since the Communist
Party gained power after World War II. The new one is a mix of
prominent politicians and technocrats, with only two ministers
retaining the seats they occupied in Mikulic's government.
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar and the defense minister, Gen.
Veljko Kadijevic, carry over but Defense Minister Dobrosav Culafic
lost his job.
   Culafic was severely criticized for his handling of ethnic strife
in Kosovo, the ancient heart of Serbia. The remaining Serbian
minority accuses the ethnic Albanians of discrimination.
   Gen. Petar Gracanin, president of Serbia, is the new interior
minister. Serbia is the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics, and
Kosovo is an autonomous province within it.

   In a second blow to maverick Boris N. Yeltsin in
the waning days of his parliamentary election campaign, the
Communist Party began an investigation Thursday of allegations that
he opposes some party positions.
   The decision on the final day of a meeting of the policy-making
Central Committee indicated more trouble ahead for Yeltsin. It came
two days after publication in a Central Committee journal of the
November 1987 speech that got him fired as Moscow party chief.
   Yeltsin, 58, is running for election March 26 to the new Congress
of People's Deputies and has said the campaign marks his political
rehabilitation.
   In the 1987 speech to the Central Committee, Yeltsin said faith
in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms was waning and the leader was
becoming the subject of ``intolerable'' glorification.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, chief Kremlin ideologist, told a news
conference Thursday a panel was formed to investigate Yeltsin's
views after complaints were received from Central Committee members.
   He said Vladimir Tikhomirov, a Moscow worker and Central
Committee member, complained about Yeltsin's view of the role of the
party, about the bureaucracy Yeltsin heads in the State Construction
Committee and about discourtesy toward Tikhomirov.
   Other party officials said Yeltsin ``expressed some views that
stood at variance with the party line and those messages received by
the plenary meeting suggested the issue be formally discussed,''
Medvedev said.
   Yeltsin defended himself against charges that he advocates a
multiparty system, the ideologist said, but also told the Central
Committee he wants the issue discussed in the official press.
   Although he still is a Central Committee member and serves as
first deputy chairman of the State Construction Committee, Yeltsin
is campaigning as an outsider for a seat representing all Moscow.
His opponent is director of the giant ZIL auto company.
   He has demanded an end to special privileges for party and
government officials; extension of Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness, and more economic reform. He remains
popular with many Muscovites, who wear buttons supporting him.
   In a debate televised Sunday night, Yelstin accused the Moscow
party organization he formerly led of conspiring against his
candidacy. In a speech a week ago, he accused the local party of
restricting voter access to his appearances.
   The weekly Moscow News said in its latest edition an anonymous
11-page criticism of Yeltsin was being distributed at some local
party heaquarters.

<TEXT>
   The wife of the USS Vincennes skipper agreed
Thursday to quit teaching at a private school because her narrow
escape from a bomb attack prompted fears that students could be
exposed to terrorist acts.
   Parents worried that their children at the exclusive La Jolla
Country Day School might be endangered if Sharon Rogers returned to
teach her fourth-grade class, and they told their concerns known to
administrators.
   ``To ensure the safety of the children, the confidence of the
parents, and the integrity of the educational environment of La
Jolla Country Day School, Mrs. Rogers and the school have reached
the mutual decision that she will not be returning to the campus,''
headmaster Tim Burns said in a statement.
   The school was the target of a bomb scare on Tuesday. Police
searched the grounds and found nothing. Extra precautions have been
taken at the campus, including daily searches of classrooms by
school personnel before the children's arrival and the posting of
security guards at the entrance gate.
   School spokesman Jim Stewart declined to go beyond Burns'
statement except to say officials at the school were grateful Mrs.
Rogers was unhurt in the bombing. He would not say whether Mrs.
Rogers told her pupils about the decision during a conference call.
   Mrs. Rogers survived the bombing of the family van unhurt as she
drove to work alone last Friday.
   The FBI is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist act
in retaliation for the mistaken downing last July of an Iranian
airliner by the Vincennes, which is commanded by her husband, Capt.
Will C. Rogers III.
   On Wednesday, a person purporting to be a member of Guardians of
the Islamic Revolution called a Los Angeles radio station and said
the group was responsible for the van bombing. The caller also
threatened more violence against Capt. Rogers and his family.
   Rogers and his wife remain under the protection of Navy security
agents at an undisclosed location, as they have since Friday's
bombing, said Dennis Usery, regional director of the Naval
Investigative Service.
   Usery declined to answer when asked how Mrs. Rogers was
responding to the decision against returning to the teaching job.
   Rogers continues as skipper of the Vincennes, which returned from
its Persian Gulf deployment last October.
   It was in the Gulf last July 3 during a battle with Iranian
gunboats that Rogers ordered the Vincennes' crew to fire missiles at
what was thought to be an attacking Iranian fighter jet. The plane
actually was a civilian airliner and all 290 people aboard were
killed in the missile strike.

   A U.S. Army colonel who supervised military
sales to El Salvador was indicted Thursday on charges he solicited
and took more than $70,000 in bribes from the president of an
Illinois gun maker.
   Col. Juan Lopez de la Cruz, a U.S. military advisor in San
Salvador between 1982 and 1984, was named in a seven-count
indictment that charged conspiracy, bribery and making false
statements, and aiding and abetting the filing of false claims.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Alexandria,
Va., accused Lopez of conspiring with Dennis J. Reese, president of
Springfield Armory, Inc. to take bribes and to circumvent rules of
the foreign military sales program.
   The indictment charged that Lopez solicited and received $70,000
in bribes from Reese, who pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy
and to filing a false statement. Reese also purchased, at Lopez's
request, a $4,722 Rolex watch for the colonel.
   In return for the bribes, Lopez is accused of signing false
documents that enabled Springfield Armory to be reimbursed for sales
of weapons to the Salvadoran government, including $94,600 in phony
sales commissions.
   The indictment charged that Lopez and Reese arranged for false
commissions to be paid to two Salvadorans they designated as agents
to circumvent regulations governing the military sales.
   Lopez directed Reese to make out checks to the Salvadorans, who
cashed them and returned the money to Reese _ minus their fee, the
indictment said.
   Lopez, who was the advisor to the Salvadoran Military Group,
which advised the Salvadoran government on weapons sales, was
accused of signing false government documents stating that
commissions had been paid on the sale of $3.7 million worth of
firearms.
   He is also accused of aiding and abetting Reese's filing of false
claims for reimbursement of $94,600 from the Defense Department for
the false commissions.
   If found guilty of all seven counts, Lopez could be sentenced up
to 15 years for each of the two bribery charges and five years for
each of the five remaining counts.
   The bribery charges together would carry a fine of $210,000 while
the other charges carry fines of $250,000 apiece.
   Attempts to reach Lopez for comment were unsuccessful.

   President Bush on Thursday moved to deflect
criticism that his administration is off to a slow start, declaring
``more is going on than meets the eye.''
   In his first trip back to his adopted home state since the
inauguration, Bush said he was grappling with ``ticking time bombs
that we need to defuse without delay. And we're doing just that.''
   He mentioned the savings and loan industry, burgeoning debt in
the Third World and drug abuse in the United States.
   Bush said in a luncheon speech that his administration was
working on ``an American agenda for the long term.''
   In the speech and a question-and-answer session that followed,
Bush also:
   _Called on Congress to move more quickly on his plan to shore up
troubled savings and loans, saying ``there's no excuse for delay.''
   _Declared himself ``very pleased'' that the Senate Armed Services
Committee had voted approval of his new defense secretary nominee,
Rep. Dick Cheney, but also complained anew that his rejected first
choice, former Texas Sen. John Tower, was ``tried by perception and
rumor. That is not the American way.''
   But in Washington, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., released an
unclassified FBI report which said a background investigation of
Tower had turned up ``a prior pattern of alcohol abuse.'' It was
reports about Tower's drinking and relations with women, along with
his acceptance of consulting fees from defense contractors, that led
to his defeat.
   _Firmly restated his opposition to Democratic-backed efforts to
raise the minimum wage to $4.65 an hour, saying his own plan for a
maximum $4.25 wage with a lower ``training wage'' was ``my first and
last offer.''
   _Said in regard to the emotional issue of restrictions on
semiautomatic weapons, ``I do want to find a solution to the
so-called AK-47 assault weapon problem _ one that protects the
rights of the legitimate sportsman but also protects the lives of
our police officers who are laying their lives on the line.''
   Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president supports the
action Wednesday of Colt Industries to suspend sales to the public
of its AR-47 semiautomatic rifle, the civilian version of the
military M-16.
   ``He thinks it's a reasonable move on their part,'' Fitzwater
said.
   On Tuesday, the administration announced it would suspend the
import of most foreign-made semiautomatic rifles.
   In addition to saying he was pursuing his agenda at his own
speed, Bush said Thursday he was not going to be forced into moving
more quickly in dealings with the Soviet Union.
   He said recent changes in the Soviet Union ``are profound.''
   ``But we're facing a challenge. We've got to figure it out. We've
got to measure Soviet intentions and then move,'' he said.
   On another foreign policy issue, Fitzwater said Bush had decided
in principal to go ahead with a proposed joint venture with the
Japanese for the production in Japan of a new version of the F-16
fighter.
   However, the spokesman said that Bush must still decide on
safeguards to prevent the loss of sensitive technology and that a
final decision may not come until next week.
   Bush told his audience at the Forum Club in Houston, ``I've come
home to Texas to tell you we're hard at work in Washington _ and
we're making progress.''
   Later, he was traveling to Colorado Springs, Colo., to address
the Junior Achievement National Business Leadership Conference.
   When he arrived at 6,800-foot high Colorado Springs, Bush
immediately went to a local high school and did seven laps _ walking
and jogging _ around a quarter-mile track.
   As he passed a group of reporters, the president threw up his
arms and said, ``no air.''

   Later, Bush focused on educational issues in a speech to the

   ``I can't think of any issue that is larger _ or more far-ranging
in its impact than the education of our youth,'' Bush said in
prepared remarks.
   ``When it comes to our nation's future, education is the key.
It's the best investment we can make,'' he said.

   Before leaving on his two-day western trip, Bush talked to the
Discovery shuttle astronauts _ ``today's pioneers'' _ from the Oval
Office, inviting them to the White House upon their return and
promising ``a strong, active space program'' despite budget
constraints.
   Eight weeks into his administration, Bush has been the target of
criticism in the Democratic-led Congress that he has failed to move
quickly enough on an agenda.
   Bush said Thursday, ``In this kind of work, more is going on than
meets the eye _ or makes the headlines.''
   ``The proof will come when we look back from the year 2000. And
I'm confident that we will be able to look back with pride on work
we did to get ready for a new century _ provided we look forward
today.''
   In Washington, Vice President Dan Quayle also defended the new
administration's pace, saying, ``We're succeeding an administration
of our own party at a time when the country is in good shape ... so
we're certainly not going to be stampeded into doing things for the
sake of doing them soon, or quickly, or to show `momentum' or some
such thing.''
   ``Quick fixes are often bad fixes,'' Quayle added, in a speech to
the National Press Club.
   Bush rattled off a variety of positions his administration has
advanced _ ranging from a new child-care tax break he offered on
Wednesday to month-old legislation to rescue the nation's troubled
savings and loan industry, a prime issue in Texas, home to many of
the nation's insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   He said S&amp;L officials ``guilty of criminal actions'' must be
``pursued and punished.''
   Bush said the S&amp;L crisis was among the ``time bombs'' that need
to be defused, and he pressed Congress to move more quickly to pass
his plan ``with its central provisions intact.''
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said Thursday his committee plans to act on an S&amp;L bill
by April 14 and is pressing for a full Senate vote by April 21.
   ``We're going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing the
job properly,'' Riegle said.
   Some congressional debate focuses on the cost of Bush's plan. The
White House contends it would cost taxpayers $40 billion; a
Congressional Budget Office report puts the price closer to $100
billion.
   Insolvent S&amp;Ls still in operation are incurring losses of $300
million a month, Bush said, or ``almost $1 million dollars during
the course of this luncheon.''

<HEAD>Republicans Block Senate Debate on Eastern Airlines Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican lawmakers blocked Democratic efforts
Thursday night to have the Senate consider legislation that would
require President Bush to intervene in the Eastern Airlines strike.
   The procedural standoff made it likely that the measure, passed
Wednesday by the House, could not come to a vote until after the
Senate's two-week Easter recess, which begins Saturday.
   The bill would force Bush to name an emergency board to recommend
a solution to the strike, and would impose a cooling-off period of
up to 26 days during which the airline's employees would receive
pre-strike wages. Bush opposes the bill, arguing the dispute between
Eastern and its unions should be settled directly between the two
sides, and administration officials have said the measure would be
vetoed.
   After hours of closed-door talks between legislators from the two
parties, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, tried to
commence debate on the measure, arguing that steps should be taken
to end the two-week old walkout.
   ``The federal government should not simply sit by waiting for
something to happen,'' Mitchell said.
   Republicans blocked that effort, using procedures under which an
individual lawmaker can prevent the consideration of a bill. They
argued the measure should be studied for at least a week by the
Senate Labor Committee, saying the situation was complicated by
potential efforts to buy the airline and by Eastern's filing for
protection from creditors under the bankruptcy code.
   ``There is a desire for us not to bottle this thing up forever,''
said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., would not say that
Republicans would filibuster the measure, under which lengthy debate
is used in an effort to kill a bill. But he said, ``Debate would be
intense.''
   Mitchell said he would seek a vote after the Easter recess that
would prevent a filibuster. Such a vote would require 60 votes from
the 100-member Senate, in which Democrats have 55 members.
   The House passed the union-supported bill by a 252-167 vote, with
all but 20 votes coming from its majority Democrats.

<TEXT>
   The defense minister and
presidential candidates on Thursday condemned a paralyzing transport
ban declared by leftist rebels and urged voters to reject guerrilla
violence by going to the polls Sunday.
   ``We have enough evidence of the Salvadoran people's courage to
know that they will go out to vote on Sunday,'' Defense Minister
Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova said in a television interview.
   There was virtually no traffic on the streets as the guerrilla
transport ban took effect at midnight Wednesday. Officials
discovered tiny, sharp three-pronged devices scattered on city
streets early Thursday.
   The army said it was providing protection for travelers on 80
percent of the country's highways but acknowledged late Thursday
that the traffic ban was 90 percent effective.
   ``It is not support for the ban, but fear that kept the buses off
the highways,'' said an army spokesman on usual condition of
anonymity.
   There were no additional reports of armed rebel activity late in
the day. Most businesses in the capital were open, but customers
were few.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the umbrella
coalition of five groups fighting the U.S.-backed government,
decreed the ban after the failure of negotiations over its offer to
participate in the election.
   ``The FMLN has no right to prevent the people from voting,''
declared Fidel Chavez Mena, candidate of the incumbent Christian
Democratic Party.
   Guillermo Ungo, candidate of the leftist Democratic Convergence,
condemned the rebels for engaging in violence after having offered
to join the political process.
   ``They want to jump in bed but still remain a virgin,'' said
Ungo, whose alliance maintained close links with the FMLN and gives
voters the opportunity to vote for a leftist presidential candidate
for the first time since 1979.
   The other top candidate is Alfredo Cristiani of the conservative
Republican National Alliance, or Arena. Polls show Cristiani
gathering the largest share of Sunday's vote, but there is a high
possibility for error due to the reluctance of many people to give
their views.
   In a statement released in Mexico City, the guerrillas said the
election was an attempt to legitimize the war and to ``justify
continued U.S. arms shipments and aid.''
   The statement said the election would be a fraud in which the
military would control ``the votes and the results.'' However, the
rebel statement also said working for Ungo was a ``valid option.''
   Francisco Merino, Arena's vice presidential candidate, said the
rebel ban and the wave of violence ``are an illogical mistake of the
FMLN.''
   ``They had been given an opportunity to show their sincerity in
the proposal for peace. Their leadership is showing that they have
no intention of paying attention to this call we and the people and
the international community have made on them,'' Merino said.
   Nearly 1.8 million voters are registered to vote for president
and vice president. In addition to the top three, there are four
minor party candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50
percent on Sunday, the top two vote-getters will face each other in
a runoff.
   The winner will take over the presidency from Jose Napoleon
Duarte, the incumbent Christian Democrat, on June 1.
   The FMLN on Thursday urged all government election officials to
quit their jobs, and their guerrillas attacked a coffee storage
facility and sabotaged electrical power lines. One soldier was
killed and four others wounded during a rebel attack, the armed
forces press office said.
   Appealing for calm, Vides Casanova said, ``We are going to hear
some bombs, and we are going to see sabotage and they will make us a
bit nervous.''
   Vides Casanova acknowledged the rebels were capable of causing
disruptions and referred to guerrilla sabotage during elections in
1982 and 1985.
   ``It is easy to disrupt electricity or to throw a bomb. They have
done that in the past,'' he said. The rebels boycotted previous
elections this decade, saying the voting was little more than part
of a U.S.-designed counterinsurgency strategy. Still, as many as 75
percent of eligible voters went to the polls in 1985.
   The guerrillas offered to take part in elections if they were
postponed and other guarantees were put in place, but negotiations
with the political parties and the government stalled.
   The army provided trucks under military escort to transport
capital residents, while a few private pickup trucks volunteered
their services.
   Eight armored vehicles escorted a four-truck convoy carrying
passengers along a highway from San Salvador to towns to the east.
   ``The armed forces are here to protect you from the terrorists of
the FMLN,'' a loudspeaker blared as the convoy departed a bus
terminal.
   Previous bans have been effective because the guerrillas sabotage
or burn vehicles that violate it. Reports from the countryside
indicated the ban had virtually paralyzed traffic outside the
capital.

   The Senate marked the fourth anniversary of the

Thursday calling for the release of all hostages.
   The Senate, on a voice vote, said it ``condemns all forms of

   The Transport Department says it issued two
warnings of a bomb plot in the month before Pan Am Flight 103 blew
up over Scotland, but the airline said Thursday it never received
the first warning and the second arrived weeks late, by mail.
   The Times of London reported Thursday night that police know the
bomber's identity and will disclose details next week. But
authorities denied reports in a British tabloid that a suspect was
arrested.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon said the second warning, two
days before the Dec. 21 crash, was ``of no importance whatsoever,''
because the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration already issued its
own warning to U.S. carriers about the threat.
   Members of the opposition Labor Party accused the government of a
cover-up and demanded an investigation. The Transport Department
issued its statement Wednesday night after a newspaper report of the
warnings.
   The warnings issued by the British government Nov. 22 and Dec.
19, just two days before the disaster that killed 270 people, spoke
of a bomb hidden in a radio-cassette player, the Transport
Department said.
   Police say they established that the explosives were in a
radio-cassette player planted in a suitcase stowed in the jumbo
jet's hold.
   Pan Am said the Transport Department's Dec. 19 memo did not reach
it until Jan. 17 and that it never received the Nov. 22 warning. In
New York, company spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon acknowledged Pan Am did
receive the FAA warning Nov. 18 and as a result ``put into place
some heightened security procedures,'' but she declined to elaborate.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt, changing to a Boeing 747 in
London. It blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people
aboard and 11 on the ground.
   The Times reported in its Friday issue, early copies of which
were available Thursday night: ``Police and security service
investigators now know precisely who made and placed the bomb and
the whereabouts of the bomber.
   ``The results of what Whitehall (British government) sources term
`one of the most remarkable feats of criminal detection ever known'
are expected to be disclosed next week.
   ``It is understood that Mr. Channon has already discussed the
findings in outline with Dr. Jurgen Warnke, his West German
counterpart,'' the Times said without giving any further details.
   Authorities denied a report Friday by the London tabloid Today
that said the terrorist who planted the bomb was under arrest
``somewhere in Europe.''
   A police spokesman in Frankfurt, West Germany, quoted by the
British domestic news agency Press Association said he knew nothing
about any terrorists being held in connection with the bombing. A
spokesman at the Scottish Office, the British government department
responsible for Scotland, described the report as ``pure
speculation.''
   A photostat of the Dec. 19 warning published by the Daily Mirror
showed it addressed to ``All U.K. airlines (and El Al, Air India,
U.S. airlines, South African Airways).''
   The Mirror said the notice advised security authorities to look
for telltale signs: that the instrument wouldn't play, its insides
would rattle, the X-ray would show more wiring than usual and the
antenna socket would be taped shut.
   Suspicions of a bomb plot arose in October when West German
police caught a Palestinian terrorist group with a radio-cassette
player containing explosives and a barometric device that would
detonate a bomb at high altitude, according to British and West
German officials.
   ``We sent advice to the relevant security authorities,'' the
Transport Department said in its statement. ``They were told what to
look for. The American authorities would have done the same for
American airlines.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
arrests in West Germany also prompted the FAA issued a warning Nov.
18 that told of the terrorist group, ``the existence of this bomb,
its characteristics, and to advise that increased security measures
should be introduced to counter this threat.''
   ``This bulletin remains in effect today,'' he added.
   On Dec. 5, the U.S. Embassy in Helsinki was warned in a telephone
call of a plot to bomb a Pan Am airliner on a Frankfurt-U.S. flight
during a two-week period in December. The FAA issued an
``intelligence alert'' that there might be a bomb attempt against a
Pan Am flight from Frankfurt.
   Speaking on BBC-TV, Channon said the Nov. 22 warning was sent to
British airlines and airports, ``and of course the Federal Aviation
Administration sent out their own warning to the American airlines.''
   Asked about Pan Am's statement that it didn't get the second
warning until Jan. 17, Channon said: ``There is no importance to it
whatsoever. All it contained, virtually, was a color photograph of a
cassette player and a few more unimportant pieces of information
about how a bomb in Frankfurt had been constructed.''
   He said the evidence that the bomb was placed aboard the plane at
London's Heathrow Airport ``is very slender _ indeed all the
evidence seems to point the other way.''
   Asked if this meant he was blaming U.S. and West German
authorities for failing to prevent the bombing, he said: ``I don't
make any comment about that. That's for the investigators to decide
and for the police.'' West German authorities say there is no firm
evidence that the bomb was smuggled aboard in Frankfurt.
   In Frankfurt, Manfred Langendorf, chief of the Hesse state
interior ministry's office for airport security, said Thursday all
airlines operating in West Germany _ including Pan Am _ were told in
early November about the radio-cassette player containing explosives.
   David Wilshire of Britain's governing Conservative Party, who
follows air transport affairs, denied suggestions authorities simply
dropped a highly sensitive warning into the Christmas mail deluge.
   He said the Dec. 19 warning was sent by telex and the mailed
versions were courtesy copies. He said that Pan Am, in any case, had
received one of the November warnings.
   Wilshire said security officials at London's Heathrow Airport
built a mock bomb after the Nov. 22 warning to run through X-ray
machines, but added that the machines scan only carry-on bags and
airlines are responsible for checked luggage.
   Labor Party transport spokesman John Prescott said the
government's responses were ``just not good enough. The government
are covering up. ... Let's have a public inquiry.''
   Elizabeth Delude-Dix, an American whose Irish husband was killed
on Flight 103, said: ``I'm bewildered and also very angry.
   ``Now we know that the government had information which told them
the carrier that would be affected _ Pan American; the origin of the
flight _ Frankfurt; that the threatened period was during the month
of December, and now we've learned that they also had information
about the exact kind of bomb that was used.''
   If security authorities had ``only looked at all the information
at their disposal they could perhaps have prevented this,'' she said.

   Advocates for the homeless and state and
congressional housing experts on Wednesday criticized a federal
panel charged with coordinating programs for the homeless, saying it
had done virtually nothing to provide shelter for people without
housing.
   The complaints about the Interagency Council on the Homeless came
at a joint hearing of two House subcommittees Wednesday, while the
Senate subcommittee on housing introduced legislation its sponsors
touted as the ``framework for a new national housing strategy.''
   The litany of the council's failures began in the opening
statement from Rep. Cardiss Collins, D-Ill., who chairs the
Government Activities and Transportation subcommittee of the
Committee on Government Operations.
   ``It didn't hold meetings; it didn't set policy; it didn't
coordinate federal programs; it didn't assess the needs of the
homeless; it didn't recommend legislative changes or funding
levels,'' said Collins.
   It ``has failed almost completely to carry out the mandates set
for it by Congress,'' she said.
   The council, established in 1987 by Title II of the McKinney Act,
was given the responsibility to coordinate 20 new programs created
by the law, monitor implementation of programs to the homeless,
disseminate information about the programs to local governments and
non-profit organizations serving the homeless, and help them develop
new programs.
   But Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the Employment and
Housing subcommittee and co-host of Wednesday's hearing said much of
the information that homeless providers needed to apply for McKinney
funds was provided instead by the National Governors' Association.
   Wendy Adler of the NGA testified that after receiving numerous
requests from the states for information, she had developed and
updated three times a report on the status of programs under the
McKinney act and related legislation.
   ``This publication contains the type of information the council
should be disseminating,'' said Adler, chiding the council for not
fulfilling ``its most basic mandate.''
   Other witnesses said the council has failed to develop a complete
staff, identify regional and field coordinators for programs and to
clarify their duties, focused too much on the development of an
electronic data base which homeless providers could not use, missed
application deadlines, met only five times in 18 months, and
produced only three monthly newsletters which contained useless
information.
   The council, comprised of the heads or their designees of 10
Cabinet departments and five independent agencies, was headed by
former housing secretary Sam Pierce. Lantos joked that the late
Elvis Presley had been seen more often on Capitol Hill than Pierce.
   ``The duties with which the council is charged and its ability to
carry them out must be brought into balance,'' said Cassandra Moore,
the council's former executive director.
   She said Congress gave the council broad authority to develop
programs and issue timetables, but not the power or resources to
fulfill its mandate as described in McKinney.
   Moore also recommended increasing the staff size and removing the
council from under the administrative wing of the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. She said HUD had been resistant to
sharing information on homelessness and virtually non-communicative.
   But HUD had provided administrative support to the council on a
continuing basis, according to James Stimpson, a deputy assistant
housing secretary.
   He said the new administration has made homelessness one of its
highest priorities and sees the council as ``an effective partner''
in addressing the problem.

<TEXT>
   Israel's hawkish industry minister and former
defense chief, Ariel Sharon, said Thursday that Yasser Arafat should
be killed and the Israeli army should destroy his Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Sharon, who was architect of Israel's disastrous 1982 invasion of
Lebanon, demanded a worldwide Jewish effort to end the dialogue
between the United States and the Palestinians.
   ``Our goal must be their (the PLO's) destruction,'' the outspoken
Sharon said in an interview on Israel radio. ``We should have killed
Arafat long ago.''
   He was among right-wing Cabinet ministers from Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's political party, the Likud bloc, who rejected on
Thursday a suggestion by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
that Israel talk with the PLO.
   But a leading Palestinian figure on Thursday praised Baker's
comment.
   Salah Khalaf, second in command to Arafat in Fatah, the main PLO
guerrilla group, described as ``positive'' and ``practical'' Baker's
statement before a congressional hearing that Israel might have to
negotiate with the PLO.
   ``Not bad, not bad at all, Mr. Baker,'' Khalaf, also known as Abu
Iyad, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview from Tunis with
the London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror. A copy of the interview
was telexed to The Associated Press.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, disclosed on Thursday that the
prime minister has been holding secret meetings since last December
with Palestinian leaders who do not belong to the PLO.
   Pazner confirmed a report on Israel TV that secret meetings were
under way.
   He told The Associated Press, ``Its purpose is to have a dialogue
with non-PLO Palestinians. He has been meeting with non-PLO
Palestinians, and he will continue to do so.''
   He declined to identify the Palestinians, saying ``it could
endanger their lives.''
   On Wednesday, Shamir's foreign minister, Moshe Arens, had reacted
strongly to Baker's suggestions that Israel consider talks directly
with the PLO if other peace avenues fail.
   Arens, who is visiting the United States before an expected April
trip by Shamir, expressed his displeasure with Baker's statements to
congresssional committees in a 20-minute telephone call to Baker.
   Pazner said Shamir's talks should not be misconstrued as support
for Baker's suggestion.
   ``There will be no negotiations with the PLO,'' Pazner said.
   Shamir repeatedly has rejected all talks with the PLO, contending
it is a terrorist group. But he says he is willing to talk with
non-PLO Palestinians in the occupied territories to try to achieve
peace.
   Most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip reject this
approach, insisting that the PLO is their representative. The
Israeli government contends they have been frightened into taking
this position for fear of reprisal.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Baker's
statements sabotaged Israel's efforts to draw non-PLO Palestinians
into the peace process.
   ``If we say ahead of time that these partners aren't to be found,
(if we say) let's move on to the radicals, then we are sabatoging
attempts to find the moderates,'' he told army radio.
   Deputy Prime Minister David Levy told Israel radio, ``This nation
has decided not to commit suicide. Israel will not allow the
establishment of a Palestinian state because it is a danger to our
existence.
   ``What do we have to talk about with the PLO? The weather? The
Koran? The Torah?''
   The reference was to the holy books of Islam and Judaism.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left Labor
Party, was more accepting of Baker's idea.
   ``If the PLO has ideas, we will not censor them,'' he told Israel
television. ``We will not negotiate with an organization that
engages in terror. But a nation? Yes, if the nation identifies with
this organization, we cannot censor their views.''
   Israel's two largest independent daily newspapers, Maariv and
Yediot Ahronot, on Thursday carried banner headlines portraying the
Arens-Baker dispute as a major conflict over Middle East policies.
   In Damascus, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a Marxist faction of the PLO, on Thursday condemned
meetings between Palestinians in the occupied territories and
Israeli government officials.
   In the last few months a series of meetings have taken place
between members of Israel's civil administration in the occupied
territories and prominent Palestinians.
   ``Those (contacts) run by the civil administration only aim at
creating tension and divisions in an attempt to ease the
international anger against Israel's fascist ways at curbing the
people's uprising'' against Israeli rule,'' a Democratic Front
spokesman said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   He said his organization supports talks between left-wing Israeli
peace activists and Palestinian leaders.
   Shamir has revealed no details of the new peace plan he is
expected to advance while in America. He has hinted it will call for
some kind of ``interim'' autonomy while a long-term solution is
worked out for the occupied lands.
   This approach parallels the proposal in the U.S.-brokered 1978
Camp David peace accords with Egypt. The PLO and most Arab nations
have rejected it as unworkable.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army commander Francisco Gassino
punished 13 officers Thursday for either joining a rebellion in
December or not preventing their men from doing so. Most were forced
to retire.
   Gen. Gassino's office said Col. Edgardo Parellada, director of
the Infantry School, and seven other officers were retired and Col.
Hugo Tabbia, head of the mountain warfare school in Bariloche, and
two other officers were relieved of duty, which eventually will
force them into retirement.
   Two captains were barred from continuing their studies at the
National War College.
   Parellada remained loyal to President Raul Alfonsin, as did the
chiefs of an infantry regiment at Mercedes, west of the capital, and
a communications post to the south, but all three were ousted by
subordinates who followed Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, the rebel
leader.
   Seineldin led an uprising at the Campo de Mayo army base and
Villa Martelli arsenal on the outskirts of the capital Dec. 2 and
surrendered two days later.
   He and several other officers were arrested. All are in military
prisons, along with officers involved in similar uprisings in April
1987 and January 1988.

   A lone gunman killed Congressman
Moises Espinosa on the island province of Masbate on Friday shortly
after he arrived by plane from Manila, congressional and military
sources said.
   Espinosa was the first member of Congress to be slain since
President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986.
   Rep. Antonio Cuenco, deputy speaker of the House of
Representatives, told reporters Espinosa was killed moments after
arriving in Masbate at 7:30 a.m. (6:30 p.m. EST Thursday). No
arrests were reported.
   Espinosa ran as an independent but later joined the Struggle of
the Democratic Filipino, which favors President Corazon Aquino.
   Rep. Milagros Trinidad quoted Espinosa's family as saying a
single gunman shot the congressman with a semi-automatic rifle as he
stepped onto the airport pavement.
   Earlier reports said up to five assailants attacked him. The
Associated Press reached the governor's office in Masbate by
telephone, but the woman who answered said she had no details and
the rest of the staff had rushed to the airport.
   Quoting relatives, Mrs. Trinidad said Espinosa was accompanied by
bodyguards but they were unable to fire because they had surrendered
their weapons to the plane's crew before departing Manila.
   Cuenco said five House members would fly to Masbate later to
investigate the killing. Military officials confirmed the death but
said a full report would probably not be available until Saturday
because of poor communications to Masbate, about 235 miles south of
Manila.
   Espinosa, 55, was elected to the House from Masbate in May 1987.
His brother, Emilio, is governor of the province and another
brother, Tito, is also a member of the House of Representatives.
   He was survived by his wife, Ludivina, three sons and three
daughters.
   In an earlier incident, police in Manila police reported Thursday
that a soldier who was part of the contingent assigned to protect
Mrs. Aquino went on a shooting spree and wounded two people before
neighbors stabbed and beat him to death.
   A police report said Patrolman Ramil Villafranca went on a
shooting rampage late Wednesday in his neighborhood in the
working-class district of Tondo and shot and wounded two people.
   Residents then pulled out knives and clubs, chased Villafranca,
then beat and stabbed the soldier, the report said. Villafranca's
attackers fled before police arrived, it said.
   The report did not say what triggered Villafranca's rage.

   Chile seized five Japanese fishing boats
Thursday in reprisal for Japan's closing of its market to Chilean
fruit because of a cyanide scare.
   Also Thursday, President Augusto Pinochet said the amount of
cyanide found in two Chilean grapes in Philadelphia ``wouldn't even
kill a mouse'' and called U.S. warnings about Chilean fruit
exaggerated.
   ``They tried to kill a fly with a tank,'' Pinochet said of the
U.S. caution to consumers while he visited a fruit packing house.
Then he ate several grapes.
   U.S. Ambassador Charles Gillespie defended the U.S. action but
added, ``We are all trying to get Chilean products back on the U.S.
market as fast as is humanly possible.''
   Navy Captain Patricio Urbina was quoted by the official news
agency Orbe as saying the five Japanese trawlers were held in the
ports of Talcahuano, Chacabuco and Punta Arenas, in southern Chile.
   Orbe also quoted Urbina as saying a sixth Japanese boat, in
waters near Antarctica, will be seized when it arrives at a Chilean
port.
   Adm. Jose Merino, navy commander-in-chief, told reporters: ``The
Japanese have closed their market to Chilean fruits, so I'm holding
their ships.
   ``None of them is going to fish in our waters until they re-open
the market to our fruits,'' said Merino, who is also president of
the law-making Military Junta.
   Late Thursday, naval sources said two of the seized Japanese
vessels were docked for repairs. The sources said the vessels were
registered in Chile but operating leased by unidentified Japanese
fishing companies.
   An anonymous caller on Thursday claimed a rocket would be fired
at the U.S. Embassy in Santiago. Police checked a nearby building
but found nothing. They increased security around the embassy.
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday urged consumers not to
eat Chilean fruit after two grapes in Philadelphia, in a shipment
from Chile, were found to contain a small amount of cyanide. Many
supermarkets pulled Chilean fruits from their shelves.
   Canada and Japan followed the U.S. lead.
   The fruit was found after the U.S. and Japanese embassies in
Santiago received anonymous phone calls saying that Chilean fruit
would be poisoned. The Chilean government blamed leftist terrorists.
   Pinochet made his remarks during a surprise visit to two fruit
packing houses near Santiago, where a worker handed the president
and army commander a cluster of seedless white grapes, saying: ``Mr.
President, these are the grapes they claim are poisoned.''
   ``They are very good,'' Pinochet replied, as he ate several.
   Business and trade union organizations say thousands of workers
have been fired as a result of the measure against the nation's
booming fruit export industry. The industry employs 500,000 workers
and exports 65 percent of its products to the United States.
   ``What worries me most is you, the workers. I'm studying a
compensation for you all,'' the president said.
   Pinochet told workers he expects a solution to the problem
``probably within the next five days or so.''
   The government said it increased security measures throughout the
fruit export sector, including reinforcing controls in the fields,
packing houses, in transportation and ports.
   Chileans have reacted angrily to the U.S. warnings. On Thursday,
hundreds gathered before the U.S. Consulate in Santiago carrying
sigs reading ``Mr. Bush: Chilean Fruits are OK,'' and ``Chile
demands compensation.''
   Trucks loaded with fruit were taken to the demonstration site,
and free grapes and apples were distributed to the people. Many ate
them, others took them home.
   Government officials and private businessmen have said the crisis
will cost Chile up to $1 billion in lost fruit exports, which have
become one of Chile's most successful economic items in recent years.
   Last year, fruit exports earned $581 million and had been
expected to bring in $850 million this year.

   Communist rebels killed a police
intelligence agent Wednesday in a Manila suburb, and the military
said nine other people were slain in clashes between insurgents and
government forces.
   Police said Patrolman Leandro Serrano was in his jeep preparing
to leave for work in suburban Navotas when five gunmen opened fire,
killing him instantly.
   The assailants, who escaped, left a note signed by the Alex
Boncayao Brigade saying Serrano was slain because he was assigned to
a police counterintelligence unit.
   The Alex Boncayao Brigade is the Manila wing of the New People's
Army, which has been waging a 20-year insurgency to establish a
Communist state.
   On Mindanao island, 500 miles southeast of Manila, the military
said three rebels and three soldiers were killed Monday in Lanao del
Norte province.
   Three more soldiers died in rebel ambushes the same day in the
Mindanao provinces of Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Norte,
military reports said.
   In another development, the military said nine soldiers and four
Defense Department civilians were fired for financial irregularities
as part of a crackdown on corruption.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the 13 dismissed
employees had finance jobs at the Armed Forces General Staff, the
central Philippine Visayas Command and at the military hospital in
Quezon City.
   He said all were undergoing investigation to determine if they
would be court-martialed for embezzlement or misappropriation of
funds.
   The military command has come under increasing pressure from
Congress, the public and the news media to eliminate corruption,
which flourished in the 160,000-member army during the 20-year
administration of President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos was ousted in
1986.
   Also Wednesday, President Corazon Aquino told reporters she had
approved in principle a package of reforms and other measures her
government will undertake as a condition for $1.3 billion in IMF
loans.
   She said a ``letter of intent'' accepting the IMF terms will be
forwarded to Fund headquarters in Washington after a review by the
Philippine Senate.
   Formal approval also will pave the way for $1.6 billion more in
new loans from commercial banks and for talks with foreign creditors
to reschedule up to $2 billion of the country's $28 billion foreign
debt.
   In its letter of intent, the government pledges to reduce the
budget deficit by improved tax collection, to liberalize imports
regulations and to disband or sell off most of its state-owned
businesses.
   It also agrees to continue a floating exchange rate which has
seen the peso lose about three percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar in the past year.
   Critics contend the government cannot meet the terms of the
package without raising prices for electric power, transport and
food.

   FBI agents who searched a St.
Petersburg lawyer's office found further evidence linking him to the
disappearance of a Mississippi millionaire's wife, a prosecutor told
a federal magistrate Wednesday.
   U.S. Magistrate Harvey Schlesinger ordered the lawyer, Newton
Alfred Winn, held without bond and returned to Mississippi to stand
trial on federal charges of extortion and perjury in the kidnapping
of 73-year-old Annie Laurie Hearin.
   Mrs. Hearin, wife of Jackson, Miss., businessman Robert Hearin,
disappeared on July 26, 1988, and has not been found although her
husband complied with a ransom note.
   While Winn is not charged with the woman's kidnapping, he is
charged with extortion for hiring a woman to mail a note from Mrs.
Hearin to her husband urging him to comply with a ransom demand.
   He also faces charges of lying to a federal grand jury on Aug. 3,
when he denied any knowledge of the disappearance, FBI officials
said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Kunz said agents searched Winn's
combination home and law office and found a map of Jackson, Miss.,
with the location of the Hearins' home circled. Also marked were the
locations of businesses and a little-known farm owed by the Hearins'.
   The agents seized six aerial maps of Jackson, an old Royal
typewriter, a 9mm semi-automatic gun and a .38-caliber revolver.
   The FBI has concluded that a Royal typewriter manufactured
between 1912 and 1926 was used to type the ransom note for Mrs.
Hearin. Investigators are conducting tests on the typewriter found
at Winn's home to see if it was used to type the ransom note, Kunz
said.
   Kunz also said a neighbor of the Hearins identified Winn from a
photo lineup as a man she had seen in a white van in the
neighborhood a few days before the kidnapping.
   FBI agent Thomas Montgomery testified that Winn paid a woman
friend $500 to fly to Atlanta and mail a letter written by the
kidnap victim a couple weeks after the kidnapping. The letter urged
Hearin to meet the ransom demand.
   The day after receiving the note, Hearin paid out almost $1
million to the 12 men listed in the ransom note, including Winn, who
returned the money.
   Winn, 64, who served as his own attorney for the hearing, stood
up near the end of the hearing and said, ``Much of this surprises
me.''
   Winn and the 11 others listed in the ransom note to Hearin were
current or former franchise holders of School Pictures Inc., in
which Hearin owned controlling interest. The corporation had sued
all 12, claiming they owed the company money, and won a judgment
against Winn of about $150,000.
   Hearin's worth reportedly exceeds $100 million. He is co-owner of
Mississippi Valley Gas Co. and co-owner of Yazoo Manufacturing Co.,
a gardening equipment manufacturing company.

<TEXT>
   Eight days after completing an alchoholism
rehabilitation program, Kitty Dukakis was back on the lecture
circuit Wednesday, addressing college students on the lack of women
in politics.
   The wife of the Massachussets governor and failed Democratic
Presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis, arrived at Villanova
University wearing a soft cast on her left ankle to protect
ligaments torn in a fall earlier this week.
   She discussed her alchoholism with reporters before her speech.
   ``There's a word with my disease and that's called recovering,''
she said. ``I'll always be recovering and I hope I'll be able to
follow the steps of the program. That will be a part of my life.''
   Mrs. Dukakis said she feels encouraged about her future and
frequently described her outlook as ``positive.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was hospitalized in February for alchoholism
rehabilitation at Edgehill Newport in Newport, R.I., for 31 days.
   She has said her drinking began shortly after the November
election, but as she did at a news conference shortly after her
release last Tuesday, she refused Wednesday to blame the campaign
for her drinking.
   In her speech, Mrs. Dukakis said alcoholism or drug abuse knows
no barriers of class, race or sex.
   ``Contemporary society still reserves a special stigma, a modern
letter of scarlet, for women who become dependent on drugs, whether
liquid or solid,'' she said.
   Women are accustomed to struggles, she said, as is seen in
women's efforts to get ahead in politics.
   ``No area of political involvement is more important for women
today than that of fund raising. Here, through networks of friends,
associates and neighbors, we have a golden opportunity to make a
significant impact all across the country,'' she said.
   Mrs. Dukakis said she hasn't had a chance to form an opinion of
the Bush administration because she was not allowed to watch
television news or read newspapers during her treatment.
   In 1982 she overcame a 26-year addiction to diet pills.
   She said she is working on a book about the presidential campaign
and will continue speaking around the country.
   Before being hospitalized for alchohol addiction, she had
delivered three speeches on various topics in Los Angeles and
Florida.

   Gunmen on Wednesday killed
Francisco Peccorini, a well-known conservative political
theoretician, as he traveled in a car with his bodyguards through
the capital's downtown commercial section.
   Peccorini, 60, had escaped harm in an attempt on his life just
last week, when assailants fired at him but missed as he rode
through San Salvador.
   On Wednesday, Peccorini was shot three times in the chest,
military medical authorities said. He was taken to the Military
Hospital of San Salvador, where he died of his wounds, they reported.
   Peccorini often worked as a political consultant for the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena. He also was a member of a
Committee for the Rescue of the University of El Salvador, an
organization composed of former university professors and employees
who accuse the university of being a front for leftist rebels.
   On Friday, Rafael Mendez, a member of the same committee, came
under gunfire from attackers, but was unhurt.
   Mendez earlier in the day had complained to university officials
about what he said was the unjustified dismissal of university
employees. He also accused officials of being in league with the
rebels.

   Convicted mass-murder Charles Manson has
been transferred from San Quentin State Prison to a new maximum
security unit in the San Joaquin Valley, a prison official said
Wednesday.
   Lt. Evelyn Mazon said Manson, one of the most notorious of
California's 78,000 convicts, was sent to Corcoran State Prison this
week to be housed in the state's toughest new maximum security unit.
   ``San Quentin is undergoing a major change in mission, from a
maximum-security prison to a medium-security prison,'' said Mike Van
Winkle, a Corrections Department spokesman.
   Manson is among 957 high-risk inmates who have been transferred
to the $253 million Corcoran prison since it opened 13 months ago.
The prison's population on Wednesday was 3,576 inmates.
   Officials did not name any other well-known inmates now housed in
the facility, roughly midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco
and about 200 miles southeast of San Quentin.
   Manson, 52, has spent nearly all of his adult life in federal and
state prisons.
   He had been on parole less than two years from the federal prison
at Terminal Island near Los Angeles when his ``Manson Family'' cult
followers murdered actress Sharon Tate, coffee heiress Abigail
Folger, Polish filmmaker Voityk Frykowski and six others in a
month-long murder spree in 1969.
   Manson was convicted of masterminding and ordering the Tate and
other murders in an effort to trigger a race war that he believed
was foretold in the Beatles' song ``Helter Skelter.''
   Manson is serving a life sentence for the Tate murders, but is
technically eligible for consideration for parole, if the state
Board of Prison Terms considered him suitable for release.
   At his latest hearing 13 months ago, the board again turned down
parole for three years _ the longest period allowed without
additional review. Board member Albert Leddy at that time said it
was ``highly unlikely'' that Manson, who has been turned down seven
times for parole, ever would be released.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed solving the
crushing food crisis by doing away with centralized agricultural
planning and letting farmers lease land, decide what to plant and
sell their crops at free-market prices.
   The Soviet president said his bold bid to gradually dismantle a
bulwark of Stalinism represents ``an agrarian policy that will be
able to restore the peasant as the master on the land and dependably
solve the food problem.''
   Gorbachev said the amount of grain that rots on its way to market
due to inefficiency _ 40 million tons _ is equal to the amount of
grain the country must import.
   He told the Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee on
Wednesday that the government must give farmers more control over
land and crops, and allow market forces to set prices.

   The Republican Bush administration and the
Democratic-controlled Congress are vying furiously to gain credit
for helping American families afford satisfactory child care.
   The White House rushed a long-promised child-care bill to Capitol
Hill on Wednesday as the Senate Labor and Human Resources approved,
by an 11-5 margin, a rival $2.5 billion program of direct subsidies.
   Only those families making $13,000 or less would be eligible for
assistance under Bush's plan; the congressional proposal's income
ceiling would be each state's median income. The national median for
a family of four is $32,777.
   ``It's not a question of whether or not we're going to do
something on child care this year, but the direction it's going to
take,'' said Sen. Dan Coates, R-Ind., as the Senate panel worked
toward approval of the measure drafted by Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn.,
and co-sponsored by about 40 Senate colleagues, including a handful

   Internal Revenue Service employees in some
parts of the country are giving correct answers to telephoned tax
questions barely half the time, the IRS says.
   Nationwide, say auditors for the General Accounting Office, the
IRS is correct only 60 percent of the time _ not the 69 percent
claimed by the IRS less than a week ago. Some of the answers that
IRS considers correct could lead taxpayers to foul up their returns,
GAO said.
   Robert LeBaube, IRS director of taxpayer services, quarreled with
the GAO estimate _ but only slightly. ``As far as the IRS is
concerned, whether we are answering 30 percent of the questions
wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong, either number is
absolutely unacceptable,'' he told the House Government Operations
consumer subcommittee Wednesday.
   The IRS' own tests of its telephone-assistance system indicate a
performance no better than last year's, even though employees have
had an extra year to acquaint themselves with the big 1986 tax
overhaul. While the IRS figures it is correct 69 percent of the time
nationally, in some of the 29 calling sites the accuracy rate is in
the 50s and in others it is in the 70s, LeBaube said.

<HEAD>Zaire Wants Belgium to Atone for Colonial Era</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 30 years after independence,
Zaire says it is time for Belgium to atone for the years it held the
West African country as the colony known as the Belgian Congo.
   President Mobutu Sese Seko argues that Belgium exploited his
country before and after it gained independence in 1960.
   ``We were cheated by Belgium,'' he said recently.
   ``Our good faith was abused. Now that we are equals, we want to
put everything into question again.''
   He insists that Belgium has a moral duty to do more to help Zaire
out of its $7 billion foreign debt.
   He intends to raise the question at a top-level ministerial
conference tentatively set for sometime this spring.
   For its part, Belgium says it is ready to discuss a rescheduling
of Zaire's debt but will not renegotiate the treaties it signed with
Zaire in 1965 or discuss the way it granted independence almost
overnight in 1960.
   Belgian-Zairean relations have been punctuated by criticism here
on grounds that Mobutu's rule is authoritarian and disregards human
rights, and by complaints in Zaire about Belgian shortcomings in
helping its former colony.
   Zaire contents that Prime Minister Wilfried Martens of Belgium,
on a visit in November, was hardly generous in helping to ease
Zaire's foreign debt.
   Yet Martens' offer _ forgiving $25 million of the $125 million
Zaire owes Belgium _ was large enough to renew criticism in the
Belgian media and Parliament about the way Mobutu has run his nation
since he seized power in a 1965 coup.
   An angry Mobutu said he would have broken relations with Belgium
had King Hassan II of Morocco not proposed to mediate.
   Zaire insists the ministerial meeting this spring should touch on
old colonial disputes.
   ``The investigation of the disputes will show exactly who owes
what to whom,'' Mobutu said.
   He added that unless Belgium agrees to discuss colonial times, he
will go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague,
Netherlands, also known as the World Court.
   Mobutu claims Belgium exploited his nation's mineral wealth
before and after independence and keeping all the proceeds.
   Some here agree Belgium owes Zaire a moral debt but question
Mobutu's timing and motives for bringing the matter up now.
   ``Belgium has a historical debt,'' said Economic Affairs Minister
Minister Willy Claes. ``(But) discovering these so-called truths 25
years late ... is not very credible.''
   ``Politically, colonization was a debacle and largely linked to
Belgium's attitude,'' said Jean-Claude Williame of the African Study
and Documentation Center in Brussels. ``But you cannot convert the
moral argument into money.''
   King Leopold II gained personal control of the Congo in 1885 and
imposed a regime of forced labor.
   In his book ``Red Rubber, Leopold II and his Congo,'' the Africa
specialist Daniel Vangroenweghe wrote that the harshness of the
regime and disease depleted half the colony's population in 40 years.
   Leopold had earned a personal fortune and the scorn of world
public opinion when the Belgian state took control of the territory
from him in 1908.
   ``I will give them my Congo,'' Leopold said at the time, ``but
they have no right to know what I did there.''
   Several Belgian companies made their fortunes in the Congo in the
past century, among them Societe Generale de Belgique SA which today
is Belgium's largest holding company.
   Four Belgian companies _ all controlled by Societe Generale _ now
are drawing a net benefit from Zaire of about $300 million a year,
largely through mining and refining of Zairean copper, diamonds and
cobalt.
   Belgium is Zaire's fourth largest creditor after the United
States, France and West Germany.
   Mobutu, known in Zaire as ``The Savior Guide,'' rejects charges
that he is authoritarian with little regard for human rights and
that he has enriched himself at the expense of his 34 million people.
   His response is that he saved Zaire from political chaos,
restored law and order and created a nation out of a kaleidoscope of
ethnic tribes.
   ``If I think what the country owes me,'' he said, ``I get weak
inside, and tears well in my eyes.''
   His critics, however, point to his sizable real estate holdings
across Europe, his palatial residence in his hometown of Gbadolite
and a personal fortune said to run into billions of dollars.

<HEAD>Oscar Race for Best Actress Is a Tough Call</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five members of a new generation of American
film actress are in competition for the 61st Academy Award for best
leading role, and the power of their performances makes the race one
of the toughest Oscar calls in years.
   Meryl Streep has become an Academy Award regular, this year's ``A
Cry in the Dark'' marking her eighth nomination. Two have resulted
in Oscars: as supporting actress in ``Kramer vs. Kramer'' (1979),
and best actress in ``Sophie's Choice'' (1982).
   In ``A Cry in the Dark,'' the 39-year-old actress again portrayed
a martyred woman, the real-life Australian housewife named Lindy
Chamberlain, who spent three years in prison after being convicted
of killing her infant daughter. She insisted the child had been
carried off by a dingo, a wild Australian dog. She was finally
exonerated last September.
   As in ``Sophie's Choice,'' ``Out of Africa'' and other films,
Streep affected an accent. ``I get a lot of flak for my accents,''
she admitted in a recent magazine interview.
   She has no intention of changing her acting style because of the
kidding, but adds: ``Once in a while I think it would be a relief to
play a housewife trying to raise three kids, keep her husband and
organize her neighbors to fight pesticides.''
   Glenn Close, the scheming marquise of ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' has
a remarkable Oscar record of her own, having been nominated for five
of her eight films. But so far, no wins.
   Close, 41, was named for supporting actress in ``The World
According to Garp,'' ``The Big Chill'' and ``The Natural,'' and for
a leading role in the terrifying ``Fatal Attraction'' last year.
   ``Since the beginning of time, we've been trying to figure out
who we are in relation to the opposite sex, and then how to relate
to them,'' she has said. ``Both `Fatal Attraction' and `Dangerous
Liaisons' deal with that theme in different ways. When it comes to
sexual identity, we're living in very unsettled times.''
   For former child star Jodie Foster, the Academy nomination for
``The Accused'' confirms her emergence as a mature actress. The
recognition might help erase the notoriety caused by John Hinkley
Jr.'s attempted assassination of President Reagan. Hinkley had
attempted to impress Foster, upon whom he had fixated after seeing
her in ``Taxi Driver'' 14 times.
   Her role as the prostitute in ``Taxi Driver'' won her a
nomination as supporting actress at the age of 13. Now 26, she was
nominated as the brassy waitress who is gang-raped in the backroom
of a tavern.
   Of ``The Accused'' role, she comments: ``I like her. I think the
audience likes her. There are probably moments when they don't like
her, but she's human. She has flaws, she says the wrong things, she
can be loud, and she repeats herself.
   ``She's somebody you can know, which makes the issue of ... what
rape is all about. It becomes even more cruel when it happens to
someone you know.''
   Sigourney Weaver, 39, finds herself in the peculiar position of
being nominated as lead actress for ``Gorillas in the Mist,'' and
for support in ``Working Girl.'' It last happened to Jessica Lange
in 1982, who was nominated as best actress in ``Frances'' (she lost
to Streep in ``Sophie's Choice''), and won for supporting actress in
``Tootsie.''
   As the late naturalist Dian Fossey, Weaver did what most other
stars would never consider: she worked intimately with wild gorillas.
   She discounts the danger involved: ``I was reading a lot of
Dian's papers and rereading her book, and it seemed that she was
often threatened by gorillas, but they never actually hurt her. It
was all a question of getting to know each other.
   ``I didn't see why they would feel animosity toward me. That was
a lucky choice on my part. I don't think it would have been wise to
go in and work with animals without having previously reassured
yourself that you would be all right.''
   Melanie Griffith has been in the news with her re-engagement to
Don Johnson of TV's ``Miami Vice.'' They were divorced 12 years ago
and are expecting a child. The Oscar could bring added joy to the
31-year-old daughter of actress Tippi Hedren, who starred in Alfred
Hitchcock's ``The Birds.''
   Griffith is nominated as the wily, ambitious Tess McGill, who
rises swiftly from the secretarial pool to corporate boardrooms in
``Working Girl.''
   ``Tess correlated a lot with me and my career,'' the actress
remarked in a recent article. ``Like saying, `OK, I'm going to do
this part because I know I can. That's what Tess did, and I feel
that's what I've done _ against everybody saying, `Oh you're just a
sexpot or a nymphet.' Or, `You're a problem, you drink too much, you
do drugs.' Or `You're wild.'''
   Griffith had a wild youth and appeared nude in early films (also
seminude while vacuuming in ``Working Girl''). But the movie world
took her more seriously after her kooky Lulu in the 1986 ``Something
Wild.''

<TEXT>
   Fifty years after his appointment to the
Supreme Court and nine years after his death, William O. Douglas
remains a source of strong emotions in the state that shaped his
life and his opinions.
   A critical documentary is scheduled to air next month, a major
symposium on Douglas' career is planned in Seattle, newly released
government files reveal an FBI scheme to discredit him, and the
state Legislature is considering the $100,000 purchase of his
Cascade Mountain hideaway for a public memorial.
   ``He is a compelling figure,'' said Walt Lowe, whose documentary
is to air on public television stations. ``The strength of his
personality, the magnitude of his work. He was a person who saw a
chance to do good and he did it.''
   Douglas was raised in poverty in Yakima, graduated from Whitman
College in Walla Walla, then taught high school here for two years
before deciding in 1922 to become a lawyer. After serving as a law
professor, lawyer, and chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, he was nominated to the Supreme Court on March 20, 1939,
by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
   During 36 years on the high court, Douglas wrote a record 1,200
decision.
   He was a consistent supporter of abortion rights, First Amendment
press protections, the environment, and the rights of criminal
suspects, including the controversial Miranda decision. He used his
position to oppose racism in schools and U.S. Army surveillance of
Vietnam War protesters.
   The Supreme Court recently overturned some affirmative action
programs and will hear arguments on a case that could affect its
landmark ruling legalizing abortion, so Douglas' views remain
important, said H.G. Locke, organizer of the three-day Seattle
symposium scheduled to begin April 15. It will look at him as
environmentalist, internationalist, civil libertarian and as a man.
   Lowe's documentary, funded by the Pacific Mountain Network of the
Public Broadcasting System and produced by KYVE of Yakima, is
scheduled to air in the West on April 17, the anniversary of
Douglas' elevation to the court.
   It paints an unflattering portrait of Douglas' domineering mother
and includes a scathing attack by his daughter, a discussion of his
four marriages and his extramarital affairs, and interviews with
former clerks who remember a driving perfectionist with little
regard for their personal lives.
   What emerges is a picture of an egotistical, often unpleasant
man, deeply scarred by early poverty, who rose primarily through his
brilliance.
   Douglas' daughter, Mildred Read, remembers a distant father with
little time or use for his children. ``He didn't want to be talked
to at breakfast because he was reading the paper. He didn't know
what to do with us.''
   His first clerk, David Ginsberg, now a Washington, D.C., lawyer,
recalled a stern boss: ``There was never a thought that I was
overburdened.''
   Ms. Read said her father had many affairs, moving on as he grew
tired of each woman. Mercedes Eichholz, Douglas' second wife, whose
lengthy affair with the justice broke up his first marriage after 29
years, said, ``His pursuit was so hot and heavy he wore me down.''
   The Portland Oregonian reported in January that secret FBI files
showed a pattern of misdeeds against Douglas covering two decades
and including former President Nixon's attempt to impeach him in
1970. The FBI first began keeping tabs on him in the early 1950s,
when former Gov. Arthur Langlie wrote to U.S. Attorney General
Herbert Brownell that communists were regular guests at Douglas'
summer home in La Push.
   More than three decades later, state officials are once again
concerned with one of Douglas' summer homes _ but this time they
wish to honor the native son. A bill has been introduced in the
House that seeks to purchase the alpine cabin that Douglas built in
1965 near Goose Prairie, about 25 miles east of Mount Rainier in the
Cascade Mountains.
   A U.S. Forest Service report issued last Tuesday noted that
turning the cabin site into a wilderness studies institute would be
appropriate. ``Using the property would encourage an understanding
of wilderness principles,'' said Don Rotell of the forest service.
   Cathy Douglas Stone, the jurist's fourth wife, put the home up
for sale last year. If it becomes a public memorial, she has agreed
to return many of the furnishings and memorabilia to the
chalet-style dwelling.

   Since low-level radioactive waste dumps moved in
nearby, two communities have had opposite relationships with their
nuclear neighbors. In Sheffield, Ill., there have been lawsuits and
worries. In Beatty, Nev., the dump is called a good neighbor.

   This gray Illinois prairie has been home
to coal and crops, but it was something alien in the soil that gave
rise to 10 years of litigation and a legacy that could linger for
centuries.
   Deep in the earth among tons of waste in a long-closed dump, a
radioactive substance called tritium is leaking from dirt trenches
in which it was buried.
   Though experts say this form of hydrogen from nuclear power
plants, factories and research labs isn't enough to pose any danger,
the leak illustrates the potential risks of such dumps.
   ``Nobody knows how to safely bury hazardous waste for the length
of time the waste will be hazardous,'' argues Hugh Kaufman, a
government whistleblower who now works at the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. ``It's all supposition and prayer.''
   Others say the industry has come a long way since the late 1960s,
when the low-level nuclear waste dump opened in Sheffield. Still,
scientists concede that while tests to determine the suitability of
the Sheffield area were considered sufficient then, they'd be
terribly inadequate by current standards.
   ``In the mid-'60s, not much was known about the regulation of
low-level waste disposal,'' said Dave Ed, senior nuclear scientist
at the Illinois Department of Nuclear Safety. ``We've learned an
awful lot in 20 years. We've learned before you OK a site ... you
should do a very thorough investigation. We've learned it after the
fact in Sheffield.''
   ``By today's standards, that site shouldn't or wouldn't be
used,'' said Ed, noting the soil is too sandy and gravelly, allowing
water to move distances in six months that experts originally
thought would take hundreds of years.
   Ed says the dump has a mixed record.
   ``It didn't contain the radioactivity as predicted,'' he said.
``But it continues to isolate the radioactivity from people.''
   That doesn't satisfy local activist Stanley Gingrich, who heads a
citizens group that has opposed the dump as well as an adjacent one
filled with non-nuclear hazardous waste that is also leaking.
   ``It has to be one of the biggest blights in this country,'' he
said.
   Even those who believe the operators were conscientious say it
doesn't do a community any good to be near two leaking dumps.
   ``It's definitely been a deficit to us,'' said businessman Bob
Sprowls, adding, ``Like anybody else, I don't know what's out there.
... I'm not smart enough to know what the real danger is.''
   The 20-acre dump, located about 3{ miles from this west-central
town of 1,100, is in a former strip mining area now dotted with
farms.
   It holds about 3.3 million cubic feet of low-level radioactive
waste, including contaminated tools and clothes from hospitals and
nuclear power plants, 100 pounds of plutonium and uranium and parts
of a dismantled nuclear reactor _ all buried in 22 trenches.
   The dump was closed in 1978 when the state refused to allow the
operators, then Nuclear Engineering Co., to bury waste in a new
trench. The state said tritium, which also is used in most modern
bombs, was leaking and the ground was too sandy.
   Nuclear Engineering decided to leave.
   The company ``put the keys to the gate on the table in one of the
sheds and sent us a telegram saying, `We have finished our work at
the site. Since you own it, it's yours again,''' said Clifford
Weaver, a private attorney who represented the state.
   The state filed a $97 million lawsuit, charged the company had
broken its 99-year lease. A judge ordered the company, which in 1981
became US Ecology, Inc., to remain there until trial.
   A decade later, an out-of-court settlement was reached. US
Ecology will commit more than $8 million to test, monitor and
maintain the area, remain there until 1998 and build a new
4{-foot-thick clay cover over the dump.
   State officials insist the agreement is fair. Gingrich disagrees.
   ``We think our community was sold out not having any input in
that settlement,'' he said. ``Eight million dollars and they're able
to walk away in 10 years. ... We think $8 million is peanuts to take
care of that site.''
   As part of the 1988 agreement, US Ecology also purchased a
170-acre buffer zone and built a fence around it after it was
discovered tritium had moved beyond the dump into nearby groundwater
and a lake.
   That angers Gingrich. The state's ``Band-Aid has been to allow
them to buy more property where it's leaking,'' he said. ``We can't
say there's devalued land next to it because they bought the land.
... It can move to the end of town and they can continue to buy the
land. Can they buy the town eventually?''
   But Ed says the land has been thoroughly studied and experts feel
the leak can be contained within the buffer zone until the
radioactivity decays. Most, he said, will be gone within 100 years.
   Ed also said the highest levels of tritium, which leaked because
earthen covers didn't prevent rain from seeping into the radioactive
material, amount to only 10 percent of the maximum the government
allows to be released to unrestricted areas.
   ``The levels we're talking about you can't build bombs,'' he
explained, noting the same was true of the plutonium, which is
thoroughly dispersed.
   However, the plutonium and uranium will remain hundreds of years,
and though it's unlikely they'll move, people must be prevented from
digging into the waste. ``The site has to be monitored and
maintained for a hundred years at least,'' he said.
   Though one legal battle is over, a 9-year-old lawsuit is pending
over US Ecology's 45-acre non-nuclear hazardous waste site.
Chemicals are leaking from the 4.3 million cubic feet of waste, and
some of the chemicals have apparently mixed with the tritium.
   US Ecology also is spending more than $1.3 million to study the
scope of that problem and seek remedies.
   Meanwhile, the company started holding community forums last year
to keep the town informed of its work.
   ``The site is a mystery to a lot of people,'' said Mark Cade, the
site's post operations manager. ``The word radioactive puts
everybody on guard. ... By being more open than we had in the past,
it would give them an opportunity for a better understanding of what
goes on out there.''
   ``They're trying to communicate more than they used to,''
confirmed Mayor Jack Weber. ... (Before) they did things they didn't
tell us about. ... The public relations is better now.''

   ``Live-In'' star Chris Young is CBS's great young
hope to become a teen TV heartthrob like NBC's Jason Bateman of
``The Hogan Family'' and ABC's Kirk Cameron on ``Growing Pains.''
   CBS, in need of younger viewers, has two new family sitcoms
premiering Monday that are designed to lure them.
   ``Live-In'' just might entice teen-agers, if CBS can get them to
tune in to begin with. The network hasn't fared well in the
half-hour comedy area, and its kid-appeal, high-school drama ``TV
101'' has been passed over in the ratings.
   The new shows will move into the time periods vacated by
``Newhart'' and ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' which move to later in the night,
replacing ``Almost Grown,'' which is on hold.
   ``Live-In'' has two appealing young stars (Young and Lisa
Patrick), a likable sitcom family, sprightly writing and enough
daring to avoid yawn inducement in teens long jaded by sexually
exploitative films. It airs opposite NBC's kid-appeal hit ``ALF.''
   Preceding ``Live-In'' is ``Heartland,'' a farm family sitcom
that's kind of a ``Little `Roseanne' on the Prairie.'' It's opposite
``The Hogan Family.''
   CBS is hoping Young will have the same teen appeal as Bateman and
Cameron. He plays Danny, a typically girl-crazy kid who can't
believe his luck when his parents hire a charming Australian au pair
girl, Lisa (Patrick), to care for their infant daughter.
   Lisa trots around in crop tops and miniskirts, but expertly fends
off the advances of Danny and his obnoxious friend, Gator
(Lightfield Lewis), who shows up the morning after she has moved in
and sensitively queries Danny, ``So, d'ya boff her yet?'' To placate
those who aren't enchanted by simple-minded sex jokes, good sense
ultimately triumphs over the kids' rampant lust.
   Hugh Maguire plays good-natured dad, proprietor of a sporting
goods store. Kimberly Farr is Supermom, filled with angst at
returning to work and leaving her baby in the hands of a stranger.
``I'm all set,'' she declares. ``I've got my briefcase, my Wall
Street Journal, my breast pump.'' David Moscow is the suitably
baffled younger brother.
   Robert Sternin and Prudence Fraser created the series and wrote
the pilot, one of the better ones of the season.
   ``Heartland'' stars Brian Keith as curmudgeonly B.L. McCutcheon,
who lost his farm to the bankers and had to move in with his
daughter, Casey (Kathleen Layman), her farmer husband Tom (Richard
Gilliland) and their three kids. Teen-aged Johnny (Jason Kristopher)
dreams of living an urban existence in glittery L.A., while his
brother Gus (Devin Ratray) rhapsodizes about his pet pig. Daisy
Keith plays their adopted Vietnamese daughter, but she doesn't have
a lot to do in the pilot.
   Not unlike blue-collar family in ``Roseanne,'' they struggle
against financial realities with humor.
   The pilot relies too much on one-liners, but there's something
endearing about a comedy that even dares to occasionally mention God.
   In the pilot, the family has to bring in the wheat crop without
their broken-down combine before a fierce storm blows in. They do
and it does, bringing with it a tornado. When they emerge from the
basement to see if their home is standing, Tom declares, ``It's
still here, but there's a dead witch under the house and
everything's in color!''
   B.L. is supposed to be a kind of Archie Bunker of the Plains, but
he's too sweet to take seriously. B.L. and Tom carp at each other,
but beneath it all have a begrudging mutual respect. There's a nice
moment When Tom tries to tell B.L. he appreciates the way B.L. stood
up to the smarmy finance man who's trying to buy Tom's farm.
   Good-hearted ``Heartland'' is produced by Tony Thomas, Paul Witt
and Don Reo, who is also the writer.

   Elsewhere in television:
   MORE THAN NOSTALGIA _ ``Making Sense of the Sixties,'' a six-part
series to air on public television in 1990-91, begins production
this month. Says co-executive producer Ricki Green, ``This is not an
exercise in nostalgia. We have promised PBS and CPB (Corporation for
Public Broadcasting) a serious examination of the decade, one that
explains how the '60s influenced who we are in the '80s and '90s.''
...
   JUST AS WE SUSPECTED _ So who's taping all these shows on VCRs?
Families with kids and money. According to Nielsen Media Research,
84 percent of VCR households have incomes of over $40,000 a year, 73
percent have members with four years of college, 76 percent have
more than four members of the family, and 74 percent have kids
between the ages of 6 and 17.

   Critics say the Academy Awards
telecast is showing its age. Producer Allan Carr says that's the way
it should be.
   In an attempt to keep the program's ratings from slipping, Carr
will celebrate Oscar by reveling in its yesteryears.
   ``I'm restoring it, hopefully, to what it was in its glorious
day,'' Carr said of the March 29 broadcast of the 61st Annual
Academy Awards from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The
program will be shown at 9 p.m. EST by ABC-TV.
   Carr and scenic designer Ray Clausen will recreate a likeness of
the Cocoanut Grove, the tropical nightclub where the Oscar dinner
banquet was held in 1940. Famous movie couples will be seated at
tables between the palm trees, and a bandstand will be on the stage.
   ``This is the ultimate variety show,'' Carr said. ``It's also the
ultimate awards show that all the other awards show copy. So I have
to make this a return to Oscar _ the way it was in the old days _
because now you have the Tonys, the Grammys, the American Music
Awards, the People's Choice Awards. ... There's an awards show on
every other week.
   ``The Oscars are supposed to be really glamorous and fun. It's
the highest awards we give our royalty in this country. I'm going to
shock people with glamour and humor.''
   Carr comes from a career filled with flamboyant spectacles. As
the producer of the stage hit ``La Cage aux folles'' and the movies
``Grease,'' ``Can't Stop the Music'' and ``Where the Boys Are '84,''
his projects have rarely strayed from playfulness and overblown
kitsch. He even held a black-tie dinner party in 1976 at the Lincoln
Heights jail in a rundown section of East Los Angeles, to celebrate
the opening of ``Murder by Death,'' which starred the late author
Truman Capote.
   ``Whether people like me or don't like me, or they like what I do
or don't like what I do, they know that I love Hollywood and I'm a
big enthusiast for Hollywood,'' Carr said.
   ``For the last four years, the orchestra has not been in the
auditorium; they were at an ABC studio five miles away and the music
was piped in. But this is going to be a Broadway show. I insisted
that the orchestra comes back, Marvin Hamlisch will be in the pit
conducting, and ramps have been put over the orchestra pit so the
people can run up the aisles.
   ``I am producing, really, two things: A live show for the people
who are there _ like a Broadway opening night _ and a television
show which has a feeling of a Broadway opening night for the people
at home.''
   There will be no single program host this year. Don Johnson and
Melanie Griffith will present the first statuette, Cher and Michael
Douglas will present the last, and dozens of other stars will manage
everything in between.
   Off-screen couples will be paired on-screen: Farrah Fawcett will
appear with Ryan O'Neal; Goldie Hawn will be with Kurt Russell; and
Demi Moore will be escorted by her husband, Bruce Willis.
   ``It's like `Chariots of Fire.' It's like a relay race,'' Carr
said. ``The presenters pass the torch to the next person.''
   The telecast will honor awards presenters as well as winners.
When Stewart and Kim Novak appear to hand out a trophy, the audience
will be shown a clip from their work together in 1958's ``Vertigo.''
   The awards show will be held on Wednesday this year, unlike the
traditional Monday. The move is a result of both the preceding
Easter holiday and a possible television technicians strike the
following week. The show, Carr said, will be seen in 164 countries,
including the Soviet Union for the first time.
   ``When it was announced that I was going to produce the show,
people said, `You've got to have more of the entrances and the
arrivals. That's what people love to see.'... The Oscars are about
entrances. And so you will see great stars, through five generations
of different age groups, making the entrances down these incredible
staircases.''
   One production number will focus on up-and-coming stars, and
there will be a retrospective of film musicals.
   ``I wanted to bring my love of the musical movie to the Oscars,''
Carr said. ``Through lots of research, I realized that more movie
stars made musicals in the '50s than any other decade. So I have put
together this homage to the stars of the '50s musical, and you will
see people like Betty Grable, Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor ... but
also Mario Lanza, Elvis Presley, Ava Gardner, Rita Hayworth and Lana
Turner.''
   Carr said complaints about past Oscar shows running past their
allotted three hours miss the real point.
   ``You only realize how long it is if you're bored,'' he said.
``My answer is: You didn't ask how long `Ben Hur' was. Now that
`Lawrence of Arabia' is out again _ it's almost four hours long _ no
one complains. If you're entertained, you don't watch the clock.''
   To keep the pace brisk, Oscar winners with multiple trophy
recipients _ as is common in technical awards _ will have one
designated speaker. After 30 seconds of thank yous, the microphone
will go dead and the camera will go to the next podium. Said Carr:
``They can talk as long as they want, but no one's going to hear
it.''

<HEAD>Attorneys Propose Change In Law To Allow Homosexuals To Wed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Goldin wants to substitute five words
in the state civil code with two words that supporters say would
undo years of anti-gay discrimination and opponents say would
undermine society's structure.
   The change Goldin wrote in a proposed code revision, unanimously
endorsed by the Bar Association of San Francisco's directors, would
define marriage as a ``personal relation arising out of a civil
contract between two people.''
   Under the law now, it's between ``a man and a woman.''
   The change would have let Larry Brinkin take a three-day leave
after the death of his lover of 11 years. His employer wouldn't let
him off, though a co-worker got time off for the death of a
stepmother he had never met.
   It would have made it easier for Donna Hitchens and her partner
to adopt. Hitchens, an attorney, had to become the child's guardian,
leaving her partner with no legal parental authority until they
successfully challenged the law; ultimately, they legally adopted
two children.
   It also would force hospitals to allow a gay AIDS patient's lover
into intensive care. Many only let in relatives.
   Gay couples live in a ``limbo-like state outside of the law,''
said Peter Keane, president of the local association. ``It's a
pariah-type class that's set up within the law. To me, it's an
unfairness issue.''
   Redefining marriage to include homosexuals would grant all the
rights, privileges _ and burdens _ of marriage to gay couples. Among
the areas affected if the proposal is made into law are tax
exemptions, inheritance laws, pensions and health plans, as well as
parenting privileges and adoption rights.
   ``We're not for it,'' said Deacon Norman D. Phillips, spokesman
for Catholic Archbishop John Quinn. ``To us, marriage is a sacrament
with deeply religious overtones. Our church believes marriage can
only be entered into by a male and a female.'' Quinn believes some
inequities may warrant compensation, but calls for use of contracts
``that don't establish a quasi-marriage.''
   The resolution must survive two local reviews to be considered by
the State Bar Conference of Delegates in September, when about 500
representatives of the state's 117,000 lawyers will consider and
propose new laws and and plan repeal efforts. If it passes, Bar
lobbyists will seek a legislative sponsor.
   The specification of ``a man and a woman'' became law in 1977
after a spate of gay marriages, which weren't prohibited then. Under
the amendment signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, homosexuals have little
say regarding partners' medical care and cannot share insurance
coverage or health benefits.
   In West Hollywood, the first U.S. city governed by a majority of
gay city officials, unmarried city employees may add their partners
to health benefit and pension plans. Berkeley and Santa Cruz offer
similar benefits.
   In San Francisco, where an estimated 10 percent of residents are
gay, Board of Supervisors President Harry Britt, the panel's only
gay member, has spent years trying to provide sweeping rights to
``alternative families.''
   Goldin, who is not gay, said her proposal also would include
child custody, community property and spousal support obligations.
   Supporters don't anticipate throngs of gay couples flocking to
the altar, but they insist that everyone should have the opportunity
_ and equal rights.
   Auto insurance companies that offer family reductions exclude
homosexuals and unmarried heterosexual couples, and income tax laws
favor married couples in some ways, according to Karen Strauss of
the Lesbian Rights Project.
   ``So long as benefits are given or taken away based on
relationship status, then we want access to them as well,'' said
Cynthia Goldstein, an attorney with National Gay Rights Advocates.
   Like many lesbians, Hitchens says she would marry if she could.
After 12 years with her partner and two adopted children, she said
economics _ not emotion _ would prompt her to tie the legal knot.
   Brinkin, who lost a court battle against his employer over
bereavement leave for the death of Richard Reich, isn't sure whether
he would marry. ``My commitment comes from my heart and I don't need
a piece of paper to do that.''
   Advocates of the change say the issue is purely a question of
law, that the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the
Constitution prohibits discrimination against classes of people and
should cover homosexuals.
   ``My guess is that the debate is going to be much more
sociological than legal,'' said Colin Wied, president of the State
Bar. ``Society would recoil at this idea. My guess is that lawyers
will follow suit.''

   Miguel Braschi and Leslie Blanchard were
regarded by friends as a loving couple, their Manhattan apartment
the home of ``any happily married couple.'' But Braschi faces
eviction because their landlord disagrees.
   When Blanchard died in Braschi's arms in 1986, Blanchard's name
was on the lease to the rent-controlled apartment the two men had
shared for a decade.
   Leases pass from parent to child or spouse to spouse under the
rent control laws in New York City's tight and pricy real estate
market. Braschi says that as a ``family member'' he should have
succession rights even though his name wasn't on the lease.
   The landlord, Stahl Associates Co., maintains Braschi had no
right to the desirable apartment because he was not a member of
Blanchard's ``traditional family unit ... those related by blood,
marriage or adoption.''
   According to Thomas Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda
Legal Defense Fund, a gay rights group, ``The case is about
individuals who live in families that vary from the Ozzie and
Harriet mold.''
   State court Judge Harold Baer ruled that the men were a family
under the rent-control law because of ``the time, love and
commitment given by Braschi to Blanchard.'' Baer halted the
eviction, but was overturned on appeal. The Court of Appeals, New
York's highest court, will hear arguments April 26.
   Braschi is allowed to stay in the apartment while the case is in
court.
   ``It's not just a question for gay people,'' Stoddard said.
``It's an issue about the right of each individual to enter into a
non-traditional, non-orthodox relationship and be protected by the
law.''
   The Court of Appeals must decide whether people in
non-traditional living arrangements _ homosexuals, unmarried
heterosexuals, even elderly couples _ have the same protection as
married couples and blood relatives.
   The court ruled in 1984 that one member of a homosexual couple
couldn't adopt the other to keep from being evicted from an
apartment that only allowed family members to live together.
   ``This is the most important case in the country dealing with
non-traditional family arrangements,'' said Stoddard. The court's
decision could affect insurance, hospital visiting rights,
inheritance and other areas in which the definition of ``family'' is
crucial.
   Blanchard had hired Braschi to manage his exclusive Manhattan
beauty salon and made him sole beneficiary, leaving him $5 million.
   Braschi and Blanchard exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a symbol of
their commitment. Braschi, 33, now wears both.
   He cared for Blanchard during the final months of his life and
was holding Blanchard in his arms when he died in September 1986.
Braschi, 33, says he and Blanchard ``regarded one another ... as
spouses.''
   ``Their friends regarded them as a `married couple' and their
apartment as `the home of any happily married couple,''' according
to court papers.
   Stahl Associates has argued that the Legislature never extended
succession rights to ``members of a non-traditional family unit,''
and has accused Braschi of trying to turn the case into a
``referendum on homosexual rights.''
   Braschi's lawyers say Stahl is trying to create that impression
``to prejudice the atmosphere,'' and that the case is simply about
family rights.
   ``What this case is about is people's relationships, whether they
will be protected, based on the strength of the relationship,'' said
Nan Hunter, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
represents Braschi.
   ``It (speaks) in terms of family relationships. Family would be
not just spouses. You're protected under this law if it's your
uncle.''

<HEAD>Best Picture Nominees Offer Wide Range of Place and Theme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From 18th-century France to the backroads of
1960s Mississippi to today's corporate Manhattan, the Academy Award
nominees for best picture of 1988 offer a wide range of place and
theme.
   But the front-runner seems to be ``Rain Man,'' the saga of an
autistic savant kidnapped by his cold-hearted brother, which has
already won the Directors Guild award for its director, Barry
Levinson.
   ``Rain Man'' had its problems before production. Dustin Hoffman
was intrigued with playing a retarded man, gifted with a genius for
numbers. The role of the autistic man's brother, a scheming
salesman, was closer to Hoffman's age, but the actor heeded his
agent's advice after Hoffman and Warren Beatty's ``Ishtar''
disaster: Don't put two middle-aged actors on the screen. Hearthrob
Tom Cruise jumped at the chance to act with Hoffman.
   Directors Martin Brest, Steven Spielberg and Sydney Pollack
undertook ``Rain Man'' in succession; all three withdrew for various
reasons. The project soon began to look like one of those dream
movies that never get made.
   Then Hoffman met Levinson (``Good Morning, Vietnam'') at a
performance of the Cirque de Soleil in Santa Monica, Calif. Levinson
directed ``Rain Man'' under schedule and $2.5 million under the $24
million budget (including an estimated $5 million apiece for the
stars). The film has grossed $126.1 million.
   ``Dangerous Liaisons'' is another film with an unsettled history.
The source material, Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel about sexual
intrigue among French aristocrats, long had been overlooked by a
Hollywood that disfavored costume dramas. ``Don't give me any
pictures where they write with feathers,'' Jack Warner is reported
to have once said.
   When ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' became a hit play in London and
New York, Lorimar Telepictures bought the rights and hired the
playwright Christopher Hampton to write the script. The movie was
filmed in France as Lorimar's fortunes were flagging. Also, Milos
Forman was shooting another version of Laclos' work.
   After British director Stephen Frears had made ``Dangerous
Liaisons'' (the title anglicized for Americans), Lorimar sold out to
Warner Bros. Despite fears the movie would be ditched, Warners has
given it a decent and slow release, hoping for word-of-mouth
support. The gross after 11 weeks: $21.2 million.
   The most controversial of the film nominees is ``Mississippi
Burning,'' a fictionalized account of the investigation of the 1964
murder of three civil rights worker in Neshoba County, Miss. The
Chris Gerolmo script, directed by Alan Parker, tells the story
through the eyes of two FBI investigators, played by Gene Hackman
and Willem Dafoe.
   ``Mississippi Burning'' was attacked by those who participated
and reported the 1964 Freedom Summer. Said author David Halberstam,
who covered the story for the New York Times: ``Parker has taken a
terribly moving and haunting story and he has betrayed it, turned it
into a Martin-and-Lewis slapstick between two cops. It's a bad
movie: `Mississippi False.'''
   ``It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did
not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the
movie could remember,'' said Myrlie Evers, whose activist husband,
Medgar Evers, was murdered by white segregationists outside his
Mississippi home in 1963.
   Gerolmo, not an Oscar nominee, replied: ``I never understood this
to be Hollywood's `civil rights' picture. It's an exciting story
about something important. You see our moral failures and greatness.
It allows us to see America at its very worst and also to see people
who displayed great moral courage.''
   ``Mississippi Burning'' (the FBI code for the case) drew mixed
reviews, several awards and only fair business ($28.8 million in 13
weeks).
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' marks the third collaboration between
actor William Hurt and director Lawrence Kasdan; they also worked
together on ``Body Heat'' and ``The Big Chill.'' In the new film
Hurt plays a travel writer who writes books for people who hate to
travel. His private life is torn between his estranged wife
(Kathleen Turner) and an uninhibited dog trainer (Geena Davis).
   While reviews were generally excellent, some criticized the
passivity of Hurt's character. ``What's wrong with the heroism of a
man who has traveled two inches?'' Hurt replies. ``That two inches
is very profound.''
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' has had a fairly good response at the
box office: $28.8 million in 11 weeks. But receipts have dropped off
in recent weeks.
   ``Working Girl'' gives top billing to Harrison Ford and Sigourney
Weaver, but they are virtually supporting players to third-billed
Melanie Griffith. She plays the central figure of Tess McGill, a
shrewd, ambitious secretary who uses tricks worthy of the CIA to
climb to the top of the corporate ladder.
   The script bounced around 20th Century Fox until it reached Mike
Nichols, who agreed to direct. ``One of the hardest things for a
director to find in the '80s is a good story,'' he says.
   ``Every actress in town wanted this part,'' says Melanie
Griffith. ``You should see the script. I'm on every page.''
   Because Nichols insisted on the little-known Griffith (``you can
see right into her feelings,'' he said), Fox paid big salaries to
Ford and Weaver to assure star value.
   Though some critics twitted ``Working Girl'' as a fairy tale,
most were favorable. Audiences agreed. The gross so far: $54.2
million in 11 weeks.

<HEAD>Oregon Shakespeare Festival's Hits And Misses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the snow melting on peaks around the
Rogue River Valley, it's time for a return to the Oregon Shakespeare
Festival, where the 1989 season has opened with four plays examining
personal conflict.
   Although it will be another three months before the festival
opens its outdoor Elizabethan stage, the two indoor theaters are
presenting Arthur Miller's ``All My Sons,'' Edmond Rostand's
``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' C.P. Taylor's ``And a Nightingale Sang...''
and Januscz Glowacki's ``Hunting Cockroaches.''
   ``All My Sons,'' ``Cyrano'' and ``Nightingale'' are standout
productions with sparkling individual efforts, strong ensemble work
and innovative sets that sustain the festival's high standards.
   The most impressive must be ``Cyrano.'' It's got tender love
scenes and flashy swordplay, lightning wit and grisly battles. But
most of all, it's got Henry Woronicz in the title role, who gives a
daring, dangerous Cyrano, whose sensitive side reveals a
broken-hearted poet. At one instant, he is the Gascon warrior with
``panache.'' In another, he is a timid little boy who is ashamed of
his overgrown nose.
   Marco Barricelli and Michelle Morain give a delicious warmth to
the roles of the lovers Christian and Roxanne, and Mark Murphey
brings the villainous Count de Guiche to the very brink of darkness
without sacrificing anything in credibility.
   James Edmondson's direction is right on mark, whether the moment
calls for a kiss or a killing. William Bloodgood's set, Deborah
Dryden's costumes and Robert Peterson's lighting all add to the
success of this classic.
   In ``All My Sons,'' Miller examines the need for ethics over
greed by examining two families in crisis following the end of World
War II. Joe Keller, played powerfully by Richard Elmore, owns a
plant that turned out some defective airplane engine parts that
eventually killed 21 American pilots.
   He and his foreman both were sent to prison for passing the
defective parts along, but Joe got out on appeal and has attempted
to return to a normal life. A complicating factor is that Joe's son,
who was reported missing in action, had planned to marry his
foreman's daughter until the scandal broke.
   Joe's remaining son, Chris, is planning to marry the same girl,
and the flowering of their relationship has reopened wounds.
   Cristine McMurdo-Wallis plays Joe's emotionally scarred wife, who
refuses to accept her elder son's death; Michelle Morain brings an
understated style to the pivotal role of the girlfriend; and Mark
Murphey runs the range from utter joy to unbearable anguish as
Chris. Philip Killian directs.
   The beautiful set _ the backyard of the all-American home _ is
the work of William Bloodgood.
   World War II is also the basis for action in ``And a Nightingale
Sang...'' This time the scene is Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, where
German bombs drop outside while the Stott family deals with
emotional bombs of their own inside.
   The story centers around Helen, a pleasant but plain woman in her
late 20s who has a slight limp. Much to her surprise, she finds love
in the arms of a soldier. Then she discovers he involved with
someone else. This rather mundane plot is spiced by the antics of
Helen's parents, grandfather and sister _ a strange lot to say the
least.
   Through the chaos of war and an unsteady home life, Helen holds
herself steady and eventually overcomes her setbacks to emerge a
stronger person.
   Jeanne Paulsen's performance as Helen is one of the jewels at
Ashland this season, and the audience is clearly won over by her
spirit. But high marks are also in order for all the others in this
talented cast: W. Francis Walters as her ditty-loving communist dad,
Dee Maaske as the devoutly Catholic mother, Deena Burke as the ditsy
sister, Sandy McCallum as her spunky grandfather, Bill Geisslinger
as her brother-in-law and Remi Sandri as the soldier in her life.
   Warner Shook directs this touching play, which takes place in an
English home with the wonderfully workable set designed by Richard
L. Hay.
   The fourth offering at Ashland, ``Hunting Cockroaches,'' is also
the only one staged inside the tiny Black Swan Theatre. It centers
on two Polish immigrants as they attempt to adjust to life in
America as represented by their cockroach-infested apartment in New
York.
   Anka and Janek, played by Robynn Rodriguez and Robert
Lisell-Frank, face problems in the new world. Her accent keeps her
from finding an acting job; he's a struggling playwright.
   But they also face a variety of nightmarish ``roaches'' that
crawl out from under the bed. These include a bag lady, a censor, an
immigration officer and Polish secret police agents _ played in turn
by Philip Davidson, JoAnn Johnson and Buzz Fraser. Pat Patton is the
director.
   The cast, particularly Rodriguez, deserve praise for their
efforts. But the play never really works and tends to drag.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a recent stroll around New York's Upper West
Side, Bernadette Peters was greeted by shouts of appreciation from
passersby. For Peters, a Broadway star whose performance in ``Song
and Dance'' earned her a Tony, it's her part of town.
   But cross over to the East Side and head down about 60 blocks and
the bright lights give way to the lofts and underground art
galleries of SoHo. It's a world depicted in Tama Janowitz's
collection of stories, ``Slaves of New York,'' a new movie in which
Peters stars.
   It's also a world that the actress, a native of Ozone Park in
Queens, knew little about.
   ``It was a unique experience doing the film,'' Peters said in a
recent interview. ``There were lots of areas I had never gone to
before _ the burned- out buildings, Avenue C and D with people
living in burned-out cars. I never realized how much of that there
was.''
   ``Slaves of New York'' was developed by the producer-director
team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory, whose long list of credits
include ``A Room With a View'' and ``Maurice.''
   Peters stars as Eleanor, a copyreader at an East Village
newspaper who lives with her boyfriend, Stash, a manipulative and
highstrung artist. Dressed in layers of colorful clothing and
designing outrageous hats, Eleanor seems to share the same offbeat
outlook as her bohemian friends, yet feels inferior.
   ``She doesn't appreciate herself,'' Peters said. ``She doesn't
realize what she's capable of. Everyone else is concerned with what
will sell, but Eleanor just makes hats because she enjoys it.''
   Peters recently turned 41, but her soft features, squeaky voice
and long, curly, blond hair make her appear much younger. She has
been in show business since age 5 when she was a regular on
television's ``Horn and Hardart Children's Hour.''
   But she was a fan as well. Peters recalled seeing the film
version of ``Auntie Mame,'' with Rosalind Russell reprising her star
stage role.
   ``My girlfriends rang the bell and I said OK, and asked my mother
if I could go. I realized that when I got home how much I loved the
movie. What I love right now is that with each film I'm learning
more about being in front of the camera. It's about making that
moment immediate. I love that.''
   Movies were even more important to Peters than the newest craze
of the 1950s: rock 'n' roll.
   ``I used to come from school and there was a four o'clock movie
on. I grew up on them and watched them after school instead of
`American Bandstand.'''
   She was 9 years old when she joined Actors Equity and 13 when she
had her first major stage role as Baby June in ``Gypsy.'' Peters
limited her performing during high school, concentrating on her
studies, and didn't have any major success until the late 1960s when
she starred in ``Dames at Sea,'' an Off-Broadway spoof of the Busby
Berkeley musicals that were popular 30 years earlier.
   When her theater career sagged in the early '70s, she turned to
television and film. She was a regular on ``The Carol Burnett Show''
and also appeared on ``All in the Family.'' Her work on screen was
less notable, with a minor role in ``The Longest Yard,'' a prison
comedy starring Burt Reynolds, and parts in a pair of forgotten
films, ``Ace Eli,'' and ``Rodger of the Skies.''
   But at the same time, she was putting together a solo nightclub
act to highlight her considerable skills as an actor and singer, and
in 1974 she earned a Tony nomination as the lead in ``Mack and
Mabel,'' a musical about silent film director Mack Sennett and his
leading lady, Mabel Normand.
   In 1977, she met comedian Steve Martin and the two began a
heavily publicized personal and professional relationship, starring
in the films ``The Jerk,'' and ``Pennies From Heaven,'' during which
they broke up.
   ```Pennies From Heaven' came out during Christmas and it was
advertised as this wonderful Christmas musical,'' Peters recalled of
the 1981 film for which she earned a Golden Globe Award. ``It was
not just a happy musical.''
   Although the movie failed at the box office, Peters' popularity
was just about to take off. In 1984, she triumphantly returned to
Broadway, receiving rave reviews for her performance as Dot in
Stephen Sondheim's production of ``Sunday in the Park With George,''
   She earned a Tony nomination for ``Sunday'' and won the award two
years later as the star of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Song and Dance.''
The actress talked about the unique experience of appearing alone in
front of a live audience.
   ``You're there and I'm here and we're together,'' she said.
``We're here to have an experience. The audience was the other
character, really. I was very lucky. It felt very odd to be up there
with nobody.''
   After completing a stint as the Witch in the Sondheim-James
Lapine collaboration, ``Into the Woods,'' she began working on
``Slaves of New York,'' for which she had plenty of fellow actors
but no audience. Peters, however, enjoyed the experience and is
anxious to make more movies.
   ``You connect with the moment and the other character and
whatever's happening. I'm trying to surprise myself all the time. I
think you're always learning, you're always surprising yourself.''

   For much of his career in Broadway musicals,
James Brennan has been paid not to perform.
   You could find his name in tiny type in the Playbill, usually
beneath a sentence solemnly proclaiming, ``Understudies never
substitute for listed players unless a specific announcement is made
at the time of the performance.''
   From ``Good News'' to ``So Long, 174th Street'' to ``I Love My
Wife'' to ``Little Me'' to ``Singin' in the Rain'' to ``Me and My
Girl,'' Brennan has ``stood by'' or ``covered'' roles, terms used to
describe that unsung hero of live performance _ the understudy.
   Now, in a reaffirmation of classic Broadway folklore, the
understudy has become the star. Brennan has taken over the leading
role in ``Me and My Girl,'' the long-running British musical about a
cockney scamp who inherits a title and money but almost loses his
girlfriend because of his new-found wealth.
   ``The day of my first performance here in New York, my wife drove
me by the marquee, and I looked at it,'' he says. ``I had a double
feeling. All at once, I was saying, `I can't believe it.' But I also
thought to myself, `Yeah, it looks just like everybody else's name
did up there.'''
   The 38-year-old Brennan has been part of the ``Me and My Girl''
company since the show opened in 1986. He was the standby for its
original star, Robert Lindsay, and then for Lindsay's replacement,
Jim Dale.
   ``It was the best job in New York,'' Brennan says. ``I could come
in to work and check in at half hour (before curtain time) and then
go to the theater or go to a restaurant or talk with a friend or
read a book or do a crossword puzzle _ and I did all that.''
   During Lindsay's nine-month run, Brennan never went on for the
star, but he played the role for about six weeks during Dale's
20-month engagement. Replacing a big name can be unnerving for a
performer who must face the wrath of disappointed theatergoers
expecting to see someone else.
   ``There is a good understudy mentality and a bad understudy
mentality,'' Brennan says. ``You have to disregard the groans and
the displeasure that the audience exhibits at the beginning of the
evening and hold onto what you know the curtain call will be at the
end of the evening.
   ``I remember going through a time when I thought `How can I live
up to what the audience expects?''' he adds. ``But you get over
that. It's not your job to worry.''
   Brennan originally took the job with ``Me and My Girl'' because
he had heard the lead role was terrific.
   ``I also heard that Bob Lindsay was magic,'' he adds, ``I thought
I could learn something from him, which, in fact, was the case.''
   Last fall, Brennan replaced Tim Curry in the national touring
company of the show, playing three months around the country before
coming back to the starring role in New York.
   ``Because we have good producers, they tried to find someone with
a box-office name,'' he says. ``They didn't find anybody who fit all
the requirements of the role and still had box-office impact.''
   So Brennan was chosen for the demanding part. Now he has thrown
himself into a regimen _ a lot of rest and a lot of food so he'll
have enough strength to get through the marathon workout. But it's
something he has worked for all his professional career.
   Born and raised in Newark, N.J., he remembers discovering theater
programs an aunt had brought back across the Hudson River from
Manhattan. And he recalls lobbying to see either ``The Music Man''
or ``Gypsy.'' He didn't get to either one, but the theater bug had
bit.
   In high school, Brennan appeared in a musical every year. The
director, Robert Hayes, also ran a summer theater in Beach Haven on
the Jersey shore.
   ``He asked me if I wanted to be an apprentice there after my
sophomore year of high school,'' Brennan recalls. ``In Newark,
there's not a lot to do in the summer, so I did. I was there five
years, all summer.''
   Brennan majored in theater at Rutgers University and after
graduating went out on the road with a long national tour of ``No,
No, Nanette,'' starring June Allyson and later Virginia Mayo.
   The director was Donald Saddler who later cast Brennan in the
chorus of a revival of the 1927 college musical ``Good News.'' Since
then, he has never stopped working in the theater. His stints have
included roles in a revue ``Rodgers and Hart'' and in ``42nd
Street,'' two shows where he didn't have to understudy anyone.
   Brennan also has been back to Beach Haven to direct for Hayes and
has worked for the New Amsterdam Theater Company, directing and
choreographing such old musicals as Cole Porter's ``Jubilee'' and
Jerome Kern's ``Sally.''
   ``I find that everything is sort of a chain in show business,''
Brennan says. ``And I've been very lucky.''

   ``New York Stories''
   
   It began as an excellent idea: Take three top American
filmmakers, set them out on the streets of New York and loop their
efforts into one full-length feature to celebrate those collective
talents and the city they supposedly enshrined.
   Unfortunately, the idea doesn't quite gel with ``New York
Stories.''
   The Touchstone Pictures release consists of three vignettes by
Martin Scorsese, Francis Coppola and Woody Allen. But only
Scorsese's ``Life Lessons'' is worth the cost of today's pricey
movie tickets. It's also the first story in the production so one
can easily slip out at its conclusion and skip the next two.
   ``Life Lessons'' also is the only vignette that truly mirrors the
spirit and attitude of New York _ in this case, the downtown art
world. It has a feel, texture and mood, thanks in part to the gritty
and witty original screenplay by Bronx-born writer Richard Price,
and the sensitive and probing lens of the celebrated cinematographer
Nestor Almendros. It is a tight short story, a film exposition that
develops as brilliantly and explosively as the giant canvases
Almendros so wonderfully captures with his camera.
   Coppola's ``Life Without Zoe,'' by contrast, is a shallow effort
centered around the Sherry Netherland Hotel, the privileged few and
the superficialities of Eurotrash. It has nothing really to do with
New York and in fact concludes in Greece.
   Allen's ``Oedipus Wrecks'' justifies itself as a New York story
with a cameo by Mayor Edward I. Koch and a throwaway line about how
New Yorkers take certain bizarre happenings in their stride.
   Nick Nolte gives a memorable performance in ``Life Lessons'' as
Lionel ``The Lion'' Dolby, a brash, uncompromising, paternalistic
artist whose brutal, expansive paintings match his passion and
daring. He plays father to young women, taking them in as his art
assistants and repaying them with ``life lessons.'' Ahem.
   His latest, Paulette (Rosanna Arquette), fancies herself an
artist but has become smothered by Lionel. She's decided to leave
him, but he lures her back with no strings attached. They resolve
their relationship in a predictable way, but it's fun to watch.
   Arquette gives the same pouty, whiney, adenoidal performance
she's given in such movies as ``The Big Blue.'' She's difficult to
listen to, let alone watch. And she's dwarfed by Nolte's Lionel.
   What a joy he is, from the opening shots of a paint-splattered
cognac bottle, palette, cassette player and the artist himself
staring at a blank canvas while Procul Harum's ``A Whiter Shade of
Pale'' blasts through the studio, to his actual execution of the
canvas. One feels his brush strokes, which surely no one lower than
God is directing.
   ``Life Without Zoe'' offers little inspiration. Which is
regrettable given the vision and talent Coppola has displayed in
other works: ``Apocalpyse Now,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Tucker.''
   The story concerns 12-year-old Zoe (Heather McComb) who lives
alone at the Sherry cared for by the hotel's male staff. She is
spoiled, precocious and chatty. Her father (Giancarlo Giannini) is a
world famous flute player and stays on the road. Her mother (Talia
Shire) is an emotionally frayed photographer with an adolescent
sensibility. She, too, would rather be on the road than home. These
people don't seem to like each other or their daughter very much.
   But it's difficult to like any of them. Coppola's characters are
not real. One does not care about the distraught mother or the
abandoned child, and the father comes across as a smarmy gigolo.
   There is a happy ending with a united family, but life would
indeed be better without Zoe.
   The best thing about Allen's ``Oedipus Wrecks'' is the title.
After that, it's all down hill. The movie is only for those diehard
Woody Allen fans who get their jollies with endless jokes about the
much-maligned Jewish mother, and who think that sitting with an
analyst is a hip thing to do.
   Allen plays a 50-year-old nebish who wants to marry the
unobtainable WASP (Mia Farrow). But mom's not too keen on this

   ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen''
   
   Baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von Munchausen was a German
soldier and adventurer who lived in the 18th century. He also was a
master prevaricator whose tales would shrivel Paul Bunyan's to
munchkin size.
   Terry Gilliam, a founding member of the irreverent Monty Python
troupe, has taken this legendary liar and made ``The Adventures of
Baron Munchausen'' the third in his fantasy triology that includes
``Time Bandits'' and ``Brazil.''
   Where ``Time Bandits'' primarily had a comedic appeal to
youngsters and ``Brazil'' tapped more philosophical and political
chords, ``Baron Munchausen'' is a priceless romp with more visual
effects and excursions into pure fantasy than any movie in memory.
There's even an unbilled cameo by Robin Williams as the King of the
Moon.
   The story opens in ``late 18th century, the Age of Reason,
Wednesday,'' with an attack on an ancient city by the ferocious
forces of the Ottoman Empire. A play about Baron Munchausen is
underway at a local theater, but the real baron is in the audience
and takes issue with the mockery on stage.
   The movie soon becomes the baron's story. And the spectacle is
nonstop: a hot-air trip in a balloon made of ladies' knickers that
takes the baron (John Neville) and Sally Salt (Sarah Polley), a
little girl who believes in imagination, to the moon and heaven;
heads that separate from bodies; a Venus rising from a half-shell,
complete with little angels with little wings; sea monsters; strange
trees, creatures, seas.
   But there's so much more in Gilliam's odyssey. The film is a
wondrous and brilliant work whose underpinnings tap the very essence
of imagination and conformity. The rigid bureaucrat Horatio Jackson
(Jonathan Pryce) questions the place of fancy, imagination and
dreamers in the age of reason. There isn't one, he says.
   Fairy tales, however, never die.
   Charles McKeown, who also has the dual role of Rupert and
Adolphus, wrote the masterful screenplay with Gilliam. Eric Idle
appears as Desmond and Berthold, and Oliver Reed is Vulcan.
   The Columbia Pictures release is produced by Thomas Schuhly and
is rated PG.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
sharply in January to $9.49 billion, the lowest imbalance in three

   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the imbalance between
imports and exports fell by 13.7 percent from a revised December

   Crude oil futures prices surged to a nearly
17-month high, fueled by a report showing a drop in inventories and
ongoing signals that OPEC is continuing to cut production.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of crude oil, rose 48 cents
Wednesday to close at $19.77 a barrel. The last time the near-month
contract was higher was on Oct. 30, 1987, when the contract closed
at $19.96 a barrel.
   On Monday, the April contract broke through the $19 mark for the
first time since Jan. 19, closing at $19.03. On Tuesday, the
contract rose to $19.29.
   Other contract months also recorded healthy gains Wednesday.
   Refined oil products also soared. The April contract for unleaded
gasoline jumped 2.30 cents, settling at a 19-month high of 55.80
cents a gallon. The near-month contract last closed higher on Aug.
4, 1987, at 55.92 cents.
   Heating oil scheduled for April delivery rose 1.79 cents to close
at 54.19 cents a gallon.
   Contracts scheduled for delivery later in the year also advanced
sharply.
   Analysts said weekly statistics from the American Petroleum
Institute proved positive for the market. The report, released after
the close of trading Tuesday, showed crude oil stocks fell 2.3
million barrels last week, gasoline dropped 4.7 million barrels and
distillates, including heating oil, were down 5.9 million barrels.
   The drop in inventories reflected a sharp increase in demand,
said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc. Over the last four weeks, demand for oil
products has jumped 9 percent, Lebow said.
   ``I don't know why,'' he said. ``It's contraseasonal in the case
of heating oil and very bullish for the market.''
   Traders said the strong demand for gasoline is due in part to
concern about the availability of gasoline during the summer months
when retail sales increase. Analysts have said U.S. refining
capacity is particularly tight this year and an extra burden is
being placed on some refiners as several eastern states introduce
new higher octane regulations.
   ``People thought we would see a buildup in stocks before Easter,
or at least see them hold steady,'' Lebow said. ``I think right now
the supplies are adequate but this new report brings into question
whether we'll have enough.''
   Prices also got a lift Wednesday from an unconfirmed report that
Saudi Arabia, the largest producer among the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, was cutting production to U.S. and
European customers, traders said.
   Despite the reports, the market's underlying fundamentals were
strong to start with, said Bob Baker, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``There's an overall good indication of a healthy economy. And
there's a good demand for crude because OPEC oil producers seem to
be serious about their price target.''
   The 13 OPEC countries recently agreed to cut production in an
effort to raise oil prices. The agreement took effect Jan. 1 and
extends for six months.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Throws Out Arbitrator's Ruling in Morrell-Union Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arbitrator's ruling that union workers
who staged sympathy strikes should get their jobs back from John
Morrell &amp; Co. was thrown out by a federal judge.
   Company officials called the judge's ruling Wednesday a major
victory and said it frees Morrell from any back pay obligation.
   The union promised to appeal. At the time the arbitrator made his
ruling, a union leader said the back pay to the 2,400 workers who
went on strike could amount to $40 million.
   In a 14-page decision, U.S. District Judge Richard Battey ruled
that arbitrator William Rentfro, a University of Colorado law
professor, overstepped his authority when he decided in November
that a six-month sympathy strike at Morrell's flagship plant in
Sioux Falls in 1987 was legal.
   Battey ruled that Morrell does not have to follow Rentfro's
decision and rehire workers who were replaced during the sympathy
strike.
   ``We will immediately move to the 8th (U.S.) Circuit Court of
Appeals and hopefully get the proper decision,'' said Jim Lyons,
president of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 304A in Sioux
Falls.
   A year ago, a jury in Battey's federal courtroom in Rapid City
decided the 1987 sympathy strike and two one-day walkouts in 1986
were illegal. On Nov. 10, 1988, another jury awarded the company
$24.6 million in damages.
   Battey said the issue of whether the jury decisions in both the
liability and damage phases of the case are sound is a matter for
the appeals court.
   In order to let the arbitrator's award stand, Battey said he
would have to find that the company agreed to let Rentfro rule on
the legality of the sympathy strike on the contract language alone.
   ``The suggestion that Morrell agreed to submit the legality of
the sympathy strike to arbitration after having secured a successful
jury verdict flies in the face of common sense,'' the judge said.
   Last month Morrell imposed a new contract on workers at the Sioux
Falls plant, cutting the wages of 2,000 employees by up to 18
percent. More than half the workers at the plant are replacements
hired during the 1987 sympathy strike.

   Exports and imports both fell in January as the trade deficit
declined to $9.49 billion, according to a government report that
economists said may be good news for inflation.
   The decline in imports and exports could mean the rapid economic
expansion is cooling slightly, removing some pressure on production
costs and prices, economists said Wednesday after the release of the
Commerce Department report.
   The nation's merchandise trade gap fell 13.7 percent in January
from a revised $10.99 billion in December, the department said. A
big decline in consumer imports offset a higher oil bill.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks gained 14.29 points
on Wednesday to reach 2,320.54. The dollar also was buoyed by the
numbers, while the bond market, where pessimism is entrenched, ended
the day roughly neutral after an early rally.
   The markets' overall favorable reaction showed how investors have
been more worried lately about inflation than about the trade
deficit.
   Ordinarily a decline in exports would be considered bad news
because it delays shrinkage in the trade gap. But the 4.3 percent
drop in exports in January was seen as favorable because it meant
there was less pressure on the nation's factories to churn out goods
for shipment abroad.
   A 6.9 percent drop in imports was also seen as good news because
it meant declining demand for goods and services.
   Strong consumer demand and a strain on factory capacity have
combined to increase inflation. The Federal Reserve has responded by
pushing up interest rates, which has hurt stock and bond prices.
Slackening growth could allow the Fed to ease off on interest rates.
   Still, other reports Wednesday showed that the economy's aging
expansion continues to have plenty of strength.
   The Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.7
percent in January while sales rose 1 percent.
   A report based on surveys by the Federal Reserve's 12 district
banks said the economy's growth is putting upward pressure on
production costs and prices.
   ``Consumer spending, except for autos, has apparently gained
momentum while manufacturing, especially for export, continues to
show strength almost everywhere,'' according to the report, known as
the Tan Book.

<HEAD>Hotel Developer, Metropolitan Life Settle $7 Billion Suit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hotel developer Patrick Kennedy and
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. have settled a $7 billion fraud
conspiracy lawsuit less than two months before their case was to go
to court, officials said.
   Kennedy, owner of La Mansion Hotels in San Antonio and Austin,
charged in a January 1988 lawsuit the insurance company, which
financed construction of one of Kennedy's three hotels, conspired to
acquire the hotels and replace the management with that of its own
subsidiary, Doubletree Hotels.
   As part of the agreement announced Wednesday, the 295-room La
Mansion del Norte in San Antonio, which had been at the crux of the
lawsuit, will be passed over to Metropolitan after an uncontested
foreclosure scheduled for April 4.
   In return, Kennedy will receive financing from Metropolitan so he
can repurchase La Mansion del Rio, a 340-room hotel on the River
Walk that opened in 1968, but which Kennedy had to sell in 1986
because of financing problems.
   No financial terms of the deal were announced.
   The parties were scheduled to go to state district court on May 1.
   ``I am just absolutely, unequivocally overjoyed to be back in
absolute ownership of La Mansion del Rio. It's meant a great deal to
me since I built it in 1968 and it's meant a lot to San Antonio in
the city's growth in the past 20 years,'' Kennedy said.
   He said because of an agreement signed with Metropolitan
officials late Tuesday, he was unable to deviate much from a
prepared joint statement.
   Metropolitan spokeswoman Dorothy Kelly also said she could not
elaborate beyond the statement.
   La Mansion del Norte Hotel had been the subject of the battle
between Kennedy and Metropolitan, which had financed about $11
million for construction on the hotel.
   Kennedy claimed in the lawsuit that between 1981 and 1984,
Metropolitan began thinking of taking over La Mansion del Norte
after the insurance giant acquired 20 percent of Doubletree Hotels.
   Metropolitan planned to foreclose on the hotel after Kennedy said
he couldn't make payments on it, but a restraining order pending the
outcome of the lawsuit prohibited Metropolitan from pursuing the
foreclosure.
   La Mansion Hotel in Austin, a 350-room hotel which opened in
1984, was foreclosed on in 1987 by American General Insurance Co., a
servicing agent of Metropolitan. Kennedy was the hotel manager and
he was replaced by Doubletree.
   Kennedy said last year that because of the slump in the Texas
economy, he had approached Metropolitan about refinancing his loan
for La Mansion del Norte, but Metropolitan officials declined and
sought foreclosure.
   Kennedy declined to elaborate on his financing structure for his
planned expansion, which would include managing the hotels
initially, before deciding on ownership or construction of new
structures.

<HEAD>With PM-Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska oil production fell for the third straight
month in February and overall U.S. crude production continued to
decline sharply, an industry trade group said.
   Imports also rose last month compared with the same time last
year but consumption remained flat, the American Petroleum Institute
said in its monthly report Wednesday.
   Alaska production, which had offset declines in other parts of
the United States in recent years, fell by 100,000 barrels a day in
February, while other U.S. production dropped by 300,000 barrels a
day, a total decline of about 5 percent, API said.
   ``The year-to-year declines in production indicate a continuation
of decreases in lower 48 production as well as a flattening, if not
a reversal, of an upward trend in Alaskan production seen during the
last several years,'' the trade group said.
   Imports in February totaled 7.9 million barrels, compared with
6.9 million barrels at the same time last year, but receded from
January's high of 8.2 million, the group reported.
   API, which represents major oil producers and refiners, said the
January import surge reflected an effort by U.S. oil companies to
take advantage of cheap and plentiful world oil before OPEC began
cutting back its output early this year.
   Imports now constitute over 40 percent of the oil consumed by
Americans, a level that has raised concern about national security
as the United States becomes more dependent on foreigners for
petroleum needs.
   ``The continued decline in domestic production and rise in
consumption together imply underlying growth in imports of more than
10 percent per year,'' the trade group said.
   Contributing to the rise in overall imports last month was a
strong increase in oil products such as heating oil and gasoline.
For the first two months of 1989, product imports were up 20 percent
over the same time last year. Also, U.S. refinery capacity has
shrunk in recent years and refineries are currently operating at
more than 80 percent capacity.
   Gasoline deliveries, meanwhile, fell 1.5 percent from last
February, due partly to a normal seasonal slowdown, the institute
report said.
   Heating oil deliveries growth also dropped to 3.2 percent despite
colder-than-normal February weather, API said.
   Despite the growing imports and slowdown in gasoline demand,
total inventories fell by 8 million barrels in February, down
slightly from January and from the same time last year, the report
said.

<HEAD>Icahn Still Leading Potential Buyer Of Eastern, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wily financier Carl Icahn, the majority owner and
chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., remains the leading potential
buyer of strike-torn Eastern Airlines, according to labor and
financial sources close to the situation.
   Icahn expressed interest in buying Eastern last October, and the
Eastern Machinists, who struck the airline March 4, indicated last
week they want him to explore a possible buyout. By acquiring
Miami-based Eastern, Icahn could use the airline's north-south
routes as possible feeders into TWA's trans-Atlantic network.
   The sale of Eastern is gathering momentum as an option for parent
Texas Air Corp. as the crippling strike against the carrier
continues with no sign of resolution, said the sources, who asked
not to be identified.
   Lorenzo has asked his investment bankers at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. to gauge potential interest in buying Eastern among
investors and other airlines, the sources said.
   Drexel declined to confirm that it had been approached by Lorenzo
or make any comment on the issue, said Steve Anreder, a spokesman
for the Wall Street firm.
   On Wednesday, the 12th day of the strike, Eastern still was
operating only a fraction of its normal flights. Furthermore, most
of Eastern's pilots have continued honoring the strike despite
appeals and warnings from management, making it virtually impossible
for the airline to expand service.
   Eastern sought federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors
last Thursday. But analysts and other observers suggested that Texas
Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo would have difficulty rebuilding Eastern
through Chapter 11 and may be reaching a point where he is obliged
to sell the ailing carrier to stem his losses.
   Icahn continues to lead the list of potential buyers, followed by
Grandview, a group of investors and former corporate executives, the
sources said. The Grandview group's strongest suit is said to be
management expertise, giving it the belief that it could negotiate
contracts with Eastern's unions that Lorenzo was unable to get.
   Icahn and representatives of Grandview did not return phone calls
Wednesday seeking comment.
   Last October, Icahn talked with Lorenzo about acquiring Eastern.
The move came shortly after real estate developer Donald Trump
confirmed he was negotiating with Texas Air about a possible
purchase of Eastern's air shuttle operation.
   The planned shuttle sale, valued at $365 million, is awaiting the
approval of the bankruptcy judge.
   Icahn and Lorenzo dueled over control of TWA over three years
ago. A lot has changed since then, for both the men and the
deregulated airline business. Lorenzo, whose Texas Air empire went
on to acquire Eastern for $676 million after his TWA bid failed, may
have decided that running a debt-burdened and fractious airline is
too much trouble.
   Eastern has been fraught with labor agitation and staggering
financial losses before and since Lorenzo took over.
   For Icahn, who has chased giant companies ranging from USX Corp.
to Texaco Inc. in recent years, the acquisition of Eastern would
make TWA the largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger
miles, an industry measurement of capacity.
   Some major airlines also have been rumored to be looking at
Eastern, but the reports have been denied by spokesmen for the
carriers.
   The value of Eastern to potential buyers are its assets _ planes,
airport gates, lucrative New York-Florida routes _ which they
believe they could deploy more effectively than Lorenzo has, and
thus turn the airline around.

   A fraud probe into the Chicago futures
exchanges coincides with a congressional review of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and has raised new questions about its
ability to police abuses.
   Theoretically, Congress could decide not to reauthorize the
15-year-old regulatory body. But CFTC officials say accusations that
they have failed to curb corruption in the freewheeling futures pits
aren't true.
   ``We've had these same kinds of criticisms from the start,'' said
John V. Rainbolt, a Washington lawyer for commodities traders and
brokers and a CFTC vice chairman.
   ``Everybody's got a vested interest in doing or saying whatever
they need to promote their particular cause,'' he said in a recent
interview. ``It's a combination of bureaucratic sour grapes,
regulatory competition and power plays in Congress.''
   The CFTC was created in 1974 to enforce federal laws regulating
the futures and options markets. Congress reauthorized it in 1978,
1982 and 1986. Lawmakers are considering legislation this year to
extend its authority through 1994.
   The House Agriculture Committee, which oversees the commission,
planned on a quick reauthorization process.
   However, its chairman, Rep. Eligio ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas,
ordered an in-depth review after learning of an FBI investigation of
alleged fraud and illegal trading on Chicago futures markets, the
nation's largest.
   The FBI probe reportedly involves allegations that brokers and
traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   An immediate question that surfaced in the probe was why the CFTC
didn't root out such corruption if it existed.
   Futures trading had been regulated since 1936 by the Commodity
Exchange Authority, but Rainbolt said the agency _ ``with 161
employees in the basement of the Department of Agriculture and no
real authority at all'' _ was unable to keep pace with growth in the
industry.
   From 1969 to 1973, volume in regulated commodities doubled and
trading in unregulated commodities quadrupled to create what a
congressional report said was a $400 billion industry.
   With growth came the potential for abuses, such as the sale of
unregulated options by a California company that parlayed a $1,000
investment into a multimillion-dollar company by using new
investors' money to pay old customers.
   The firm's collapse in the early 1970s, resulting in more than
$71 million in customer losses, was cited as the catalyst for
congressional action to scrap the exchange authority and create the
CFTC.
   In a report on its activities in 1988, CFTC Chairman Wendy L.
Gramm said the commission assessed more than $2 million in civil
penalties for violating commodities laws last year, decided more
than 500 reparation cases and issued more than 185 opinions and
orders.
   Nonetheless, critics have branded the commission as lax and
excessively reliant on industry self-regulation.
   The exchanges have their own operating rules, established in
alliance with the industry-operated National Futures Association.
It, in turn, acts with approval of the federal commission.
   ``This whole system was born when the emphasis was to
deregulate,'' said Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the
subcommittee investigating the CFTC. ``The issue, as we look at the
whole system, is to reassess the entire deregulation mentality: Is
it adequate? Does it need to be changed?''
   Futures industry officials contend self-regulation works well.
Some say the CFTC is too meddlesome now.
   ``Speaking as one of the regulated, I get mad at the CFTC and
disagree with them every day,'' said John M. Damgard, president of
the Futures Industry Association trade group and a commodity
purchaser himself.
   ``But the relationship is not so adversarial that we're unwilling
to admit we have somebody over there who's smart, who understands
our industry and who will listen,'' Damgard said. ``That is an
agency that, over the last 15 years, has matured into one of the
finest government agencies we have.''
   Even if lawmakers reauthorize the CFTC, some predict the debate
will resurrect jursidictional arguments over who should regulate
futures trading: the CFTC or the rival Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   ``The SEC has been a better regulator,'' said Rep. Jim Cooper,
D-Tenn. ``You need a strong regulatory body, regardless of what its
initials are, to police a group of very impressive _ and sometimes
greedy _ traders and brokers.''

<HEAD>Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Owns $1.15 Billion of Coca-Cola Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is headed by
investor Warren Buffett, has accumulated since last summer a 6.3
percent stake in Coca-Cola Co. that is now valued at about $1.15
billion, Coke has disclosed.
   Coca-Cola officials said they viewed the purchases as a ``strong
vote of confidence'' from the widely-respected investor, who with
his wife controls 45 percent of the Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire
Hathaway's stock.
   In a telephone interview Wednesday, Buffett described the stock
purchase as ``simply a passive investment'' and said he is happy
with the way the company is being managed. Berkshire Hathaway is a
diversified holding company.
   Buffett has a reputation for taking sizeable stakes in a limited
number of companies and hold them for a long time.
   The disclosure sent Coca-Cola stock up $1.25 a share to $51.50 in
active trading of about 1.1 million shares on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Coca-Cola Chairman Roberto C. Goizueta disclosed the Berkshire
holding in a memo to the soft drink maker's employees late Tuesday.
   He said Berkshire had accumulated 6.3 percent of Coca-Cola's
common stock over the ``last several months.''
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has about 364 million shares outstanding.
   Buffett said the stake amounted to about 22 million shares,
accumulated by various insurance subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway
over the past eight or nine months.
   In his memo to the employees, Goizueta said the investment ``is
in keeping with Berkshire Hathaway's track record of making
long-term investments in companies with a strong consumer franchise
and a focused business.''
   He called it ``a strong vote of confidence and a welcomed
endorsement of our past success and future potential.''
   He also noted that Buffett was ``one of the biggest fans of
Cherry Coke'' and declared it the official soft drink of Berkshire
Hathaway at that company's 1986 annual meeting.
   Buffett acknowledged that he favors the drink, and said he has
been ``very impressed by the international strength of the Coca-Cola
brand and the job that management has done.''
   He said his company had not previously disclosed the stake
because insurance companies are not required to do so until their
holding reaches 10 percent or stands at 5 percent at the end of a
year. Federal rules require other shareholders to disclose a holding
in a company when it reaches 5 percent.
   Coca-Cola is the world's largest soft drink maker. It earned
$1.04 billion, or $2.85 a share, on revenue of $8.34 billion in 1988.
   Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which has about 1.14 million common
shares outstanding, has a stock value of about $5.47 billion based
on its closing price of $4,800 a share Wednesday on the NYSE.
   Buffett, known as much for his folksy wisdom and unpretentious
lifestyle as his financial acumen, has combined a patient,
value-oriented stock strategy with a knack for finding investment
diamonds in the rough.
   Forbes magazine estimates his personal wealth at about $1.4
billion.
   Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway, a Massachusetts
cloth-milling concern with $10 million in assets, in the mid-1960s.
Since then he has turned it into a diversified holding company with
about $2 billion in assets.
   Most of Berkshire's operating revenue comes from insurance
operations. The company also has interests in the publisher Buffalo
News Inc., in Washington Post Co. and in Capital Cities-ABC Inc.

<TEXT>
   A streamlined Hospital Corporation of
America will be just the right size, Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. says.
   Shareholders voted Wednesday to sell HCA, the nation's largest
hospital management company, to a management-led group headed by
Frist in a $5 billion leveraged buyout.
   One of the first orders of business is selling off three
subsidiaries to repay a $1.3 billion short-term loan that will help
finance the buyout and clear the way for HCA's managers to run the
hospitals in the United States, Frist said.
   HCA owns 79 general hospitals and 52 psychiatric hospitals in
this country and an additional 25 around the world. It manages 191
more U.S. hospitals and two in other countries, according to the
company's 1988 annual report.
   ``It's very streamlined today, and I'm involved in the day-to-day
operations,'' Frist said during a news conference after the
shareholders meeting.
   He said the new company _ TF Investments, which became
HCA-Hospital Corporation of America on Wednesday _ has no plans to
sell its general hospitals.
   ``If you'd ask me what it'd look like one year from today ... we
have approximately 80 today. I'd be quite surprised if we didn't
have 80 then. Maybe add one and sell one,'' he said.
   Frist said managing 70 to 80 hospitals is ``ideal.''
   ``Basically, we're more focused,'' he said.
   Frist said he wants to sell the three subsidiaries _ HCA
Psychiatric Co., HCA Management Co. and HCA International _ as
intact units rather than breaking apart their assets.
   ``The idea is that we can now hopefully create three other
companies that will stand on their own,'' he said.
   The new company is paying $51 a share for the more than 71
million outstanding shares of HCA stock, making the total purchase
price $3.6 billion. Including debt, the deal amounts to more than $5
billion, HCA spokesman Victor Campbell said.
   In a leveraged buyout, the assets of the company are used as
collateral to borrow the money needed to purchase the company. Such
a transaction usually increases a company's debt substantially.
   Taking the company private ``does permit us to be more long-term
oriented, not quarter-to-quarter,'' Frist said.
   ``We can run things differently. There's no plans for layoffs or
to squeeze this company down. ... It was the right thing to do at
this time in our history.''

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs Against Yen; Nikkei Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices erased earlier gains and lost ground on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 130.73 yen, up 0.85 yen from Wednesday's
129.88-yen finish. The currency, which opened at 130.68 yen,
fluctuated in a range of 130.60 yen and 130.95 yen.
   Dealers said the currency's strength in Tokyo followed its gain
in New York overnight, inspired by a U.S. Commerce Department report
Wednesday that the nation's trade deficit fell to $9.49 billion in
January from a revised December shortfall of $10.99 billion.
   A Mitsubishi Bank dealer said ``there was no reason to sell the
dollar'' considering the trade figures. Dollar-buying interest
remained strong throughout the day, the dealer said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Market players' dollar-buying interest will remain strong for a
while,'' the dealer added.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a
376.13-point winner the previous day, erased its gains in the early
session and lost 2.24 points, or 0.007 percent, to finish at
32,098.24.
   After moderate gains in the morning session, trading in the
afternoon became directionless and fell, said a trader with a major
securities firm in Tokyo, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Although trading was active, profit-taking by speculative
investors in the afternoon session resulted in the Nikkei's loss, he
added. Volume on the first section was estimated at 1.3 billion
shares.
   ``But demand-supply balance in Tokyo stock market has been
getting better,'' the trader added.

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Up, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged higher in light European
trading early today despite what dealers said was a concerted bout
of dollar-selling by European central banks.
   Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said several central banks, including West Germany's
Bundesbank, intervened together on the open market in efforts to
curb the dollar's recent rise.
   They said the size of the intervention was not immediately clear,
but was large enough to temporarily interrupt the dollar's upward
trend.
   A trader in Rome predicted the central banks would be unable to
dampen bullish interest in the dollar. ``They intervened to put the
brakes on the dollar and to show the market that they are present,''
he said.
   The dollar headed sharply higher Wednesday after the U.S.
government reported that the nation's trade deficit shrank to its
lowest level in three months, from a revised December shortfall of
$10.99 billion to $9.49 billion in January.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.85 Japanese yen to a closing 130.73 yen. Later, in
London, it fell back to 130.27 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday's
rates included: 1.8684 West German marks, up from 1.8670; 1.6060
Swiss francs, up from 1.6038; 6.3225 French francs, up from 6.3200;
2.1129 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1065; 1,370.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,369.37; 1.1967 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1935.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7225 from $1.7235 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $390.40 a troy ounce,
down from $392.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $391.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $390.70, down from $393.25 bid
late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $5.65 to close at a bid $396.89.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a bid price of $6.07 a troy
ounce from $6.12 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Increased Plantings, Higher Fuel Prices Add to Energy Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are expected to boost plantings of corn
and some other major crops this spring, and Agriculture Department
analysts say fuel needed to do their field work will cost more _
again.
   Energy prices overall are expected to edge up in 1989 due to
higher crude oil prices, the department's Economic Research Service
said in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``Farm fuel prices rose slightly in 1988,'' the report said. ``As
a result of higher crude oil prices in the last quarter of 1988,
average petroleum product prices paid by farmers should rise
throughout 1989.''
   The report said the increase in crude oil prices during last
year's fourth quarter was prompted by an agreement of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold down
production.
   Under OPEC's agreement in November, there would be a price target
of $18 per barrel and a reduction in output from the 17-year high of
22.5 million barrels per day to 18.5 million per day in the first
six months of 1989.
   The agreement also brought Iraq back into the cartel with a quota
equivalent to that of Iran, the report said.
   According to Department of Energy forecasts, economic growth of
about 2.5 percent will offset higher crude oil prices, and U.S.
petroleum consumption will therefore inch up about 1 percent this
year.
   The report said that for the first time since 1980, domestic
petroleum demand last year averaged more than 17 million barrels a
day. Refiners paid an average of $14 per barrel in the last half of
1988, down 25 percent from 1987 prices.
   ``But prices surged near the end of 1988, and West Texas
Intermediate (crude) reached $18 per barrel in January 1989,'' the
report said. ``Crude oil prices are expected to range from $15 to
$20 per barrel in 1989.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. domestic production will probably slacken again
this year to about 8 million barrels a day, down 200,000 from last
year. And 1988 output of 8.2 million barrels a day was the lowest in
24 years.
   ``Expanding demand and decreasing domestic production are
expected to boost U.S. net imports in 1989 to 6.8 million barrels
per day, or 39 percent of domestic consumption,'' the report said.
``This rate may be compared with a record high import of 8.6 million
barrels per day in 1977, and a low of 4.3 million in 1985.''
   The energy supply and price outlook for U.S. agriculture mostly
reflects world market conditions, currently characterized by
abundant oil supplies and higher prices.
   ``In 1989, farmers can expect plentiful supplies of diesel fuel,
gasoline and LP (liquefied petroleum) gas, but at slightly higher
prices than last year,'' the report said.
   Yet, the combined use of gasoline and diesel fuel by farmers has
declined in recent years because of improved farm production
technology, shifts from gasoline to more efficient diesel units, and
greatly reduced crop plantings.
   ``Although acres planted greatly influences the fluctuations in
farm energy use, other factors also have contributed to the
decline,'' the report said. ``Continued replacement of older
gasoline machines with diesel-powered machines, particularly in the
production of cotton, rice and some minor crops, has resulted in
greater use of diesel fuel.''
   Besides acreage cutbacks under some government crop programs,
last year's drought-reduced yields also contributed to an estimated
5 percent reduction in farm fuel use in 1988, the report said. Lower
grain moisture levels at harvest also reduced energy requirements.
   But expenditures for farm energy _ gasoline, diesel fuel, LP and
electricity _ were about $7 billion last year, up 3 percent from
1977 because of higher prices and greater reliance on electricity.
   ``In 1989, energy expenditures, which comprise about 5.5 percent
of total farm production expenses, are projected to jump 7 percent
to $7.5 billion, largely due to an expected 4 percent to 11 percent
increase in planted area of the eight major crops,'' the report said.
   This will offset long-term reductions in fuel use related to
conservation, primarily from 28 million acres of land taken from
production under the Conservation Reserve Program.

<HEAD>Investigators Who Cleared Suzuki Samurai Now Looking At Ford Bronco
II</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials who cleared the Suzuki Samurai of
allegations that it tends to roll over say that study has prompted
an investigation of the Ford Bronco II, which showed a far worse
record of fatal rollovers.
   ``In the process of studying rollovers, we began to get curious
about the Bronco,'' said National Traffic Safety Board spokesman Tim
Hurd. He said the inquiry covering all 1984-89 Broncos will try to
determine if the vehicle, the types of drivers who use it, or the
environment in which it is driven contributed to the fatal accidents.
   Ford Motor Co. said it believes the record of its 590,000 Bronco
IIs is not significantly different from that of other sport utility
vehicles.
   ``The Bronco II is a well-designed, safe utility vehicle, and
Ford believes that the accident statistics do not reflect any
safety-related defect,'' the company said in a statement from
Detroit. It added that accidents in all such vehicles are ``strongly
influenced by adverse driver or environmental factors.''
   Ford spokeswoman Barbara Mansfield in Washington said the company
has done extensive testing on the Bronco II to verify it has
``reasonable and appropriate handling and stability
characteristics.''
   According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included in
last year's report on the Samurai, 43 Bronco II single-vehicle
rollovers resulted in fatalities in 1987, or 19 for every 100,000
vehicles on the road. There were eight fatal Samurai rollovers, or
six per 100,000 vehicles; 13 involving the Chevrolet S10 Blazer or
GMC Jimmy, also six per 100,000, and six fatal Jeep Cherokee
rollovers, for 2.5 per 100,000.
   The study gives no breakdown of which rollovers occurred in
off-road conditions or other details about the accidents.
   The traffic safety administration will conduct an ``engineering
analysis'' of the Bronco II, which is the second of three levels of
investigation.
   In the Samurai investigation, which was completed last Aug. 25,
the agency concluded that critics of the vehicle failed to
demonstrate that it has an excessive tendency to roll over. The
agency's Office of Defects Investigation denied a recall petition
filed by the Center for Auto Safety, a public interest group often
at odds with the industry and its regulators.
   Consumer Reports magazine, in a July 1988 issue, called for a ban
of the Samurai, saying ``it literally trips over its own feet.'' The
magazine's publisher, Consumer Union, also petitioned for standards
covering all vehicles to prevent rollovers.
   Safety administration spokesman Hurd said that although the
decision to conduct an engineering analysis of the Bronco II was
formally based on complaints to the safety administration, it also
is the result of the statistics that turned up in the Samurai
investigation.
   In the Samurai inquiry, the agency described rollovers as
``complicated dynamic events'' and acknowledged that their causes
are not entirely understood by automotive experts.
   It cited factors such as inexperienced drivers, lack of seat belt
use, alcohol use, driver error, and poor weather as contributing to
most of the Samurai rollover deaths.

<HEAD>IRS Answers Wrong 50 Percent in Some Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Internal Revenue Service employees in some
parts of the country are giving correct answers to telephoned tax
questions barely half the time, the IRS says.
   Nationwide, say auditors for the General Accounting Office, the
IRS is correct only 60 percent of the time _ not the 69 percent
claimed by the IRS less than a week ago. Some of the answers that
IRS considers correct could lead taxpayers to foul up their returns,
GAO said.
   Robert LeBaube, IRS director of taxpayer services, quarreled with
the GAO estimate _ but only slightly. ``As far as the IRS is
concerned, whether we are answering 30 percent of the questions
wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong, either number is
absolutely unacceptable,'' he told the House Government Operations
consumer subcommittee Wednesday.
   The IRS' own tests of its telephone-assistance system indicate a
performance no better than last year's, even though employees have
had an extra year to acquaint themselves with the big 1986 tax
overhaul. While the IRS figures it is correct 69 percent of the time
nationally, in some of the 29 calling sites the accuracy rate is in
the 50s and in others it is in the 70s, LeBaube said.
   He did not identify those areas.
   In an effort to improve performance, LeBaube said, the IRS is
switching to a more permanent work force, hiring fewer people to
work only during the filing season. The agency also is assigning
more supervisors and using new procedures to discover problem areas
of tax law that are causing most problems for the telephone
``assistors.''
   LeBaube advised taxpayers who call the IRS toll-free numbers to
write down their question, the date and name of the person who
provided the answer. If an answer leads to an incorrect tax return
and the taxpayer produces such a record, LeBaube said, the IRS will
waive any penalty.
   ``The assistors are not properly trained to answer questions
right 100 percent of the time?'' asked Rep. Matthew Martinez,
D-Calif. ``That, to me, is really an intolerable situation.''
   The IRS blames a complicated tax law for part of the problem, as
well as the frequency of changes in the law. GAO has said some IRS
employees are reluctant to probe for additional information from
taxpayers before answering their tax questions.
   The IRS has about 5,000 employees answering telephoned tax
questions during this filing season; about 1,500 of them are
temporaries. All are required to have at least a high school
education and receive at least five weeks' tax training.
   GAO complaints that the IRS was overstating its accuracy rate
prompted Chairman Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., to call his subcommittee
into session for a rare public airing of a dispute between two
government agencies.
   GAO and IRS agreed to work together on one test of the
telephone-assistance system and hammered out 62 questions that IRS
officials are expected to ask clandestinely about 15,000 times this
filing season.
   GAO and IRS agreed to score answers in only three ways: Correct;
correct and complete, or incorrect. After the tests got under way,
the IRS wanted a fourth grade: an answer that while not technically
correct likely would not result in a faulty return.
   GAO refused to go along, contending some of those answers from
IRS employees were potentially misleading. IRS insisted and on its
own beganscoring those answers _ which were 8.8 percent of the total
_ as correct.
   Thus, GAO came up with an accuracy rate of 60.4 percent. IRS
added the 8.8 percent in the fourth category and reached a total
accuracy rate of 69.8 percent.
   Changing the method of judging the system in the middle of the
test ``raises questions about the validity of its (the IRS's)
reported results and whether it is making progress toward improving
the accuracy of its responses,'' said Jennie Stathis of GAO.
   ``It was not our intent to mislead anyone,'' LeBaube told the
subcommittee. ``In retrospect and in fairness to GAO, we probably
should have announced both numbers.''

<HEAD>Federal Help Needed to Stop Spread of Lampreys, Congressman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Lakes region needs $9 million to buy
the only known chemical to kill the sea lamprey and develop other
means of controlling the parasitic eel or risk devastation of the
salmon and trout population, a New York congressman says.
   Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., said Wednesday that without the
expenditure, the lamprey population could double by the year 2000.
   If the lampreys double, ``this will cause the salmon and trout
populations to be cut in half, costing sport and commercial
fisheries an annual economic loss of $1.4 billion and some 33,600
jobs in the Great Lakes basin,''
   He said the regional Great Lakes Fishery Commission, based in Ann
Arbor, Mich., needs $9 million ``to keep the lamprey under control
and the fishery thriving.''
   Lampreys, native to the Atlantic Ocean, entered the Great Lakes
through the Erie Canal in the 1880s and decimated the trout,
whitefish and chub populations. They attach to fish with their
sucking mouthpiece and feed on body fluids, sometimes killing the
host.
   ``Anyone who has been around long enough can remember a time when
it seemed every trout and salmon pulled from Lake Ontario had at
least one, and sometimes more, lamprey eels stuck to their side,''
Horton said. ``The lamprey eel devastated the Great Lakes fishing
industry a few years ago, but we've come back from it.''
   The only safe and effective lamprey killer is a chemical, TFM,
that is manufactured in West Germany, Horton said. But as the value
of the dollar has dropped against the mark, the price of TFM has
risen, he said.
   ``In an effort to find alternatives to the single-source
chemical, we are requesting $1.3 million for the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's efforts to develop a sterile male program to
eradicate the lamprey population,'' he said.

<HEAD>Eastern Wins Order Against Competitors; U.S. House Asks Bush To Intervene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Strike-devastated Eastern Airlines won an emergency court order
forcing rivals to honor pacts with the carrier, and a labor-backed
measure won House approval despite resistance by President Bush to
intervene in the dispute.
   The order granted Wednesday by a federal bankruptcy judge in New
York prevents other airlines from refusing to transfer Eastern
passengers, cargo and baggage, a threat Eastern said could doom
efforts to rebuild the airline.
   The judge set a March 24 hearing on continuing the emergency
order.
   In Washington on Wednesday, the House voted 252-167 to approve
labor-suported legislation that would require a recalcitrant Bush to
appoint an emergency panel to try to end the walkout by the
Machinists union, pilots and flight attendants.
   Bush has strongly opposed intervention, and so has the
Miami-based company.
   ``It's very clear many members were merely voting to satisfy a
union constituency,'' said Eastern spokesman James Ashlock, adding
that management remains ``unalterably opposed to a presidential
emergency board.''
   Speculation also grew Wednesday that as the 13-day-old strike
continues with no sign of resolution, selling the crippled carrier
might be the only alternative for Frank Lorenzo, chairman of its
parent, Texas Air Corp.
   Texas Air's board reportedly has asked its investment banker,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to explore the possibility of selling
Eastern to other airlines and investors, a move union officials
found encouraging.
   ``It should be very clear to Mr. Lorenzo and the bankruptcy court
that any reorganization plan is going to have to be made workable by
the employees, and they've shown they're not willing to work for
him,'' pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said.
   The idea of selling Eastern was raised again at a Texas Air board
meeting last week, The New York Times reported Wednesday. Drexel
spokesman Steven Anreder said he could not immediately comment on
the report.
   Any such action must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland in New York, who is overseeing Eastern's bankruptcy
reorganization.
   Lifland could hold a hearing within a week to 10 days on the sale
of Eastern's Northeast shuttle to billionaire developer Donald Trump
for $365 million, said Bruce Nobles, president of the newly formed
Trump Shuttle.
   Union leaders were hoping to head off the sale of the lucrative
shuttle by finding a friendly buyer for the entire airline.
   ``I can't understand any rationale for jamming (the shuttle deal)
through if there is a potential buyer to take care of the whole
problem,'' said Charles E. Bryan, president of District 100 of the
Eastern Machinists union.
   Bryan spoke to corporate raider Carl Icahn several times last
year about buying Eastern and has been looking for investors to back
an employee buyout. But Cole said the unions haven't had any direct
contacts and couldn't discuss any concessions they might make to a
buyer.
   The strike began March 4 with a walkout by 8,500 mechanics and
baggage handlers in a dispute over $125 million in proposed wage
cuts and escalated with the support of pilots and flight attendants.
   Five days later, Eastern filed for bankruptcy reorganization.
   Eastern has flown about 100 flights a day, compared with 1,040
daily before the strike began.
   Ashlock said Eastern was going ahead with plans to renew jetliner
service Thursday on seven roundtrips daily between Boston and
Washington but had no immediate plans to renew more routes.
   ``You've got to not only rebuild your flight schedule, but
rebuild your passenger confidence,'' he said. ``We're taking on
pretty short planning phases right now.''
   Ashlock said the company had nothing to say about where it would
get more pilots to expand service. Eastern had about 200 pilots
available, compared with 3,600 before the strike.
   The national Air Line Pilots Association has promised
$2,400-a-month strike pay for Eastern pilots. ALPA's 41,000 members
at 47 airlines will be assessed $300 each to help pay for the strike
pay package.

<HEAD>Tax-Committee Members Join Budget Meetings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiations over the fiscal 1990 budget are
getting down to the touchy topics of tax increases and entitlement
cuts, but bargainers say decisions are still off on the horizon.
   ``Well, we're going to talk revenues and see where the
conversation takes us,'' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif., said Wednesday.
   Although President Bush has promised no new taxes, his $1.16
trillion budget includes $14.2 billion in new revenues that need to
be discussed, Panetta said. That figure includes new ``fees'' for
government services and changes in the tax law that the White House
argues are not tax increases.
   The heads of the House and Senate tax-writing committees were
joining the budget talks for today's meetings. The conversation was
also to touch on entitlement programs under those committees'
jurisdiction.
   Both Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., have said their panels
would not approve the $5 billion in Medicare cuts requested by Bush.
   Rostenkowski has also nixed Bush's plan to cut the tax rate on
capital gains.
   Bentsen on Wednesday said $7.5 billion of the Bush tax package
was based on items Congress previously rejected or was unlikely to
approve _ the capital gains tax, expanding the Medicare tax, and
repealing a scheduled cut in the airport excise tax.
   ``I find it troubling that the administration, instead of showing
leaderhip on this issue, is effectively leaving it up to Congress to
fill the gap,'' he said.
   ``I know very well the political constraints that the president
is operating under, given the `read my lips _ no new taxes' pledge
he made during the campaign last year,'' Bentsen said. ``But I must
say in all candor ... I'm going to do my best to help him but it's
hard to see how the numbers are going to add up.''
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said the appearance of the tax-writing committees in the
budget talks did not mean that the panel was leaning toward a tax
boost.
   The negotiators wanted to ``ascertain from them what's realistic
by way of spending restraints or what might be realistic by way of
revenue enhancements,'' he said.
   Richard Darman, the director of the Office of Management and
Budget, described the meetings as laying out the options rather than
hard bargaining.
   ``We still haven't really begun what I would call serious
negotiating,'' he said.
   Asked when the hard part would begin, he said, ``I thought it was
going to start a long time ago, and so far it's still going pretty
well,'' he said.

<HEAD>Excerpts of Gorbachev Speech on Agriculture</HEAD>
<UNK>With PM-Soviet-Food</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech Wednesday on developing ``an agrarian policy that
will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the land and
dependably resolve the food problem.''
   They were taken from the English-language translation by the
official news agency Tass.
   _On the overall problem:
   Further delay in this matter is simply inadmissible.
   Drastic changes in the countryside are an essential prerequisite
for the country's economic and social progress. ... We all remember
the concern expressed by delegates to the 19th national party
conference when discussing the food supply situation in the country.
We described this problem as `our society's biggest wound.'
   The state has to buy large quantities of grain, meat, fruit,
vegetables, sugar, vegetable oil and some other staples abroad. We
are still behind developed countries, big and small, in labor
efficiency, yield capacity and livestock productivity and in the
diversity and quality of foodstuffs. The gap is widening rather than
narrowing. The shortage of food creates social tension and generates
not merely criticism, but actual discontent.
   Huge capital and other investments have been made in agriculture
in recent years, but the inputs have failed to yield equally
substantial results.''
   Comrades, we should work out an agrarian policy that would enable
us to blunt the sharp edge of the food problem in the immediate
future and to grow enough farm produce, in terms of both amount and
choice, to stabilize food supplies in the 13th Five-Year Plan
(1991-96).
   In the 13th five-year period, it is planned to increase the
output of foodstuffs by 26 percent to 30 percent, while the output
of farm produce will grow by 16 percent.
   _On Stalin's brutal collectivization of agriculture:
   In the process of combatting the kulaks, violence was inflicted
upon the huge mass of middle-strata peasants and even poor ones.
Millions of peasants, together with their families, were torn away
from their land plots and native areas and suffered misfortunes,
often dying in camps and exile.
   _On leasing:
   Let us not fix assignments, let us not set deadlines. The point
at issue is the transfer of land and other means of production to
lease-holders, their real control over those means. ...
   If the plenum backs the relevant proposals of the Politburo, the
Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet and the government, and we
adopt corresponding documents, this will create legal and economic
prerequisites for an extensive transition to leasing.
   _On price reform:
   The purposes of economic restructuring cannot be achieved, new
methods of economic management cannot be introduced and a socialist
market cannot be formed without a price reform. ... Purchase prices
of some kinds of quality products are so low as not to stimulate the
development and rational distribution of specialized highly
marketable production.
   The documents circulated among you envisage the introduction of
new purchase prices of farm produce as of Jan. 1, 1990. ... The
range of products priced in a centralized way should be reduced.
   _On banks:
   There is a need for radical restructuring of the activity of
banks, particularly of the agro-industrial bank. It is necessary to
ensure that they are really interested in the development of
production and act as business partners.
   _On the independence of agricultural enterprises:
   Agricultural enterprises are really doubly dependent. On the one
hand, they are subordinated to higher bodies along the departmental
line. They are also managed in no less, perhaps even in a greater
degree, by local party and government bodies, starting from the
district level.
   Perestroika presupposes a radical change in the system of
managing the agrarian sector at all levels. ... We proceeded from
the assumption that no one should interfere in the day-to-day
economic activities of collective and state farms, and still less
with peasant and individual small holdings.
   _On equipment problems in agriculture:
   Workers of the agrarian sector rightly complain that the
machine-makers, abusing their monopoly status, often foist upon them
outdated models of expensive machines with low dependability and
efficiency standards. This is ruinous not only for agriculture, but
for the country as a whole.
   We produce more tractors than any other country in the world, and
yet complaints about their short supply are common. ...
Machine-makers should be put in such economic conditions that would
rule out the manufacture of shoddy equipment.
   _On waste in agriculture:
   Our losses in grain harvesting and pre-storage treatment amount
to 15 million and even 20 million tons. About as much is lost in
storage and processing. In all, comrades, the losses equal our
purchases abroad.
   Due to the sparsity of meat packing plants, their low
technological standards, and inefficient use of raw material, meat
losses, even according to the lowest estimates, add up to around 1
million tons. This despite the acute shortage of foodstuffs. Such is
the dimension of the problem.
   Many problems stem from the methods of economic management,
people's attitude to work and their poor motivation to achieve
better end results.
   _On ecology:
   What must be done as a matter of urgency is putting reclaimed
lands in proper order and taking measures to put land and water to
more rational use. Efforts to come to grips with ecological problems
that have piled up should not be put off either.
   We should drastically raise standards and increase accountablity
when it comes to the production, transportation and storage of
chemicals and especially their application to the soil.
   _On life in the villages:
   The peasant mode of life has lost its attractiveness and
prestige. People, above all the young, are leaving villages.
   The disregard for the needs of villages and the hypertrophied
urban development brought about great social distortions and
complicated the normal economic functioning of whole regions.
   The rates of house building in villages in the 13th five-year
period must at least be doubled.
   Villagers justly raise the issue why rural areas have been put on
`short rations' and why peasants have been left to struggle with
their problems alone, although the country has vast resources.

<HEAD>House Sends Bill To End Eastern Walkout To Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation that would force President Bush to
intervene in the Eastern Airlines strike faces stronger opposition
in the Senate, but House passage has already given organized labor a
morale boost.
   The House passed the union-sought measure 252-167 on Wednesday,
largely with the support of the chamber's majority Democrats. Only
20 Republicans supported the legislation, and just 15 Democrats
voted against it.
   President Bush opposes the bill, and Republicans in the Senate
are expected to maneuver to try to block it. That chamber's tricky
procedures often allow a minority of legislators to wreak havoc on
legislation they oppose, and the bill is given only a long-shot
chance at ever becoming law.
   Nonetheless, lobbyists for organized labor, who have rallied
around Eastern's striking unions, say they will push hard for Senate
passage.
   ``We trust they'll take it up,'' Robert M. McGlotten, director of
legislation for the AFL-CIO, said after the House vote.
   The Senate begins a two-week recess after Friday's session, and
supporters of the measure say they would like to see an effort to
take up the bill before the break. Time is a factor in the dispute,
with striking workers needing money to pay their bills and Eastern
already having obtained protection from creditors under the
bankruptcy code's Chapter 11.
   Eastern is demanding $125 million in wage and benefit concessions
from members of its machinists union, which wants $50 million in
improvements. The walkout has forced Eastern to fly only about 100
flights daily, compared to 1,040 before the strike.
   The measure would require a cooling-off period of up to 26 days
and force Bush to appoint an emergency board, which would study the
dispute and recommend a solution. Neither Eastern nor the
8,500-member International Association of Machinists, which began
its walkout March 4, would be required to accept the proposed
formula.
   But even if the measure goes no further than the House, it has
already has cheered labor and its Democratic allies.
   House passage is a morale-booster to the striking machinists and
to Eastern's pilots and flight attendants, who have also walked off
their jobs. It's an indication to the labor movement that after
eight years of rough times under the Reagan administration, it is
still capable of mustering support in Congress.
   And it has forced Bush and Republican lawmakers to appear to be
defending Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent company, Texas
Air Corp. Lorenzo has been accused by workers of trying to break
Eastern's unions and dismantle the company, and his business
practices are often criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike on
Capitol Hill, including Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner.
   Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., called Lorenzo ``the neutron bomb
of the airline industry, saving assets as booty and taking the
people and letting them go.''
   But Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., told a reporter, ``I haven't
heard any Republican stand up and defend Frank Lorenzo.''
   The bill's opponents say the Eastern walkout has caused
inconvenience but not a transportation emergency that requires
government intervention. They also note that Eastern and the
machinists began bargaining for a new contract in October 1987, and
say there is no reason to believe an emergency board would be
successful.
   Supporters argued that the emergency board would provide cover
for the two sides to be able to accept a solution to their bitter
dispute without appearing to have given in.

<HEAD>Attorney General Group Targets Car Rental Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top justice officials from all the states
are targeting rental car practices, especially the expensive
collision damage waivers and ads that they say conceal the true cost
of car rentals.
   The National Association of Attorneys General adopted guidelines
this week aimed at encouraging more accurate price disclosure and
advertising by the rental companies.
   The group issued the guidelines after their annual meeting in
Washington ended Tuesday, and after reviewing the proposals with car
rental companies.
   ``Our investigation uncovered major and pervasive problems in the
advertising and pricing practices throughout the car rental
industry,'' Robert Stephan, Kansas attorney general, said Wednesday.
``In all too many instances, consumers have found it virtually
impossible to rent an automobile for the price trumpeted in the
rental company's ads.''
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan said his state is
considering filing a lawsuit over allegedly misleading advertising
by car rental companies.
   He said that when the attorneys generals' task force began
looking into the rental practices a year ago, ``rental car ads
routinely promised low prices that were in fact a complete fiction,
with a bewildering variety of surcharges, fees and other mandatory
add-ons that drove the final price much higher.''
   Stephan said the industry has since moved to improve advertising
and eliminate misleading information on prices.
   The guidelines are voluntary and intended to advance uniform
enforcement by providing guidance for the states in enforcing their
own consumer protection laws, and for the companies to avoid
violating state consumer laws.
   Under the guidelines:
   _Mandatory fees, such as fuel surcharges, must be included in the
advertised price of a car.
   _Advertised prices must ``clearly and conspicuously'' disclose
key restrictions and conditions, such as geographic or time
limitations on price, requirements for advance payment, and the cost
of collision damage waivers.
   _Companies must maintain enough cars available at the advertised
price to meet reasonably expected demand, unless the ad clearly
states supply is limited.
   The group's task force that investigated car rentals said it
found a series of ``deceptive, unfair or unconscionable practices''
involving the waivers, including pressure to purchase them by rental
agents who made commissions on the sale.
   In many cases, a driver's personal insurance would cover repairs.
   The attorneys general recommended state legislatures adopt one of
three proposed reforms:
   _Prohibit the practice of charging for accidental damage or
theft, thus eliminating the need for the waivers.
   _Limit the amount of money for which consumers can be held liable
to $500 or less.
   _Require the cost of waivers to be regulated by the state through
its insurance department or other regulatory agency.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said the guidelines had
been reviewed by the car rental industry and that the industry
generally had no objection.
   Joe Russo, spokesman for Hertz Corp., the largest car rental
company, said it supports the proposed guideline and said it will
permit comparison shopping. Demetria Mudar, spokeswoman for Avis
Inc., the second largest rental company, said it supports the
guidelines.

<HEAD>Panel to Question Officials in Generic Drug Probe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A congressional subcommittee wants to question
more than 60 government officials and employees in its investigation
into alleged improprieties in the Food and Drug Administration's
processing of generic drug applications.
   A federal grand jury in Baltimore reportedly is conducting a
criminal investigation into the matter, based on information the
House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations uncovered last summer.
   The subcommittee's investigation is proceeding independently of
the criminal investigation, said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
subcommittee chairman, and Rep. Thomas Bliley of Virginia, the
ranking Republican on the panel.
   Dingell said Wednesday that the investigation centers on ``the
question of whether FDA processed generic drug applications fairly
and in accordance with the law.''
   Bliley said the panel's focus ``is on the approval process and
whether or not it has been conducted in a fair and impartial
manner.''
   A report in the Baltimore Sun earlier this week quoted sources as
saying the grand jury was investigating allegations that FDA
employees took bribes and accepted favors to approve companies'
applications to market generic drugs.'' The newspaper quoted one
source familiar with the investigation as saying indictments could
be returned by the end of the month.
   Generic drugs are low-cost versions of brand-name drugs. Once the
patent for a brand-name drug expires, companies can copy the
compound and apply to the FDA for approval of a new generic drug.
   Dingell and Bliley sent a letter to Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis Sullivan, whose department includes FDA, telling him
subcommittee investigators want to question employees at FDA and in
the HHS general counsel's office.
   The lawmakers provided Sullivan with a list of 64 employees the
investigators wanted to interview, but the subcommittee did not
identify them. A subcommittee source said all but four of those on
the list work at FDA and they reach as high in the agency as
Commissioner Frank Young.
   Dingell noted in the press release that ``just because a
government employee is questioned in an investigation of this
magnitude does not imply any wrongdoing on their part.''
   Dingell and Bliley told Sullivan that investigators wanted to
complete the interviews by the end of the month. They also submitted
a list of documents for the department to produce by March 24 and
noted that most items on the list ``have been the subject of
outstanding requests since last summer.''
   FDA spokesman Mike Shaffer said the agency had no comment, but he
said, ``We of course will cooperate with the investigation. The
agency is anxious to have everything resolved.''

<HEAD>Chileans Angered Over Tainted Fruit Incident In U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With millions of pounds of Chilean fruit
being held for testing in U.S. ports because of a cyanide scare,
producers and workers whose livelihoods depend on fruit exports
seethed with anger.
   ``Buy! Buy! Don't believe the gringos' lies!'' a Santiago street
vendor of grapes chanted Wednesday. Some passersby laughed and many
made purchases.
   Producers and union officials say thousands of industry workers
have been laid off as a result of the scare.
   On Monday, the United States urged consumers not to eat Chilean
fruit after two grapes imported from Chile were found to be tainted
with cyanide.
   Most Chilean fruit was pulled from U.S. markets' shelves.
   Similar decisions were taken by Japan and Canada and several
western European countries said they were tightening controls on
Chilean fruit.
   Chilean exporters, growers and packers voluntarily suspended all
operations Tuesday for 72 hours to allow thousands of crates of
stored fruit to be checked.
   The National Exporters Association said Wednesday that ``not a
trace'' of any alien substance had been found in the crates of fruit
ready for export that had so far been checked.
   Officials of Chile's military government say preliminary
estimates indicate the crisis could cost Chile at least $800
million. Nearly 65 percent of Chile's fruit exports _ grapes,
melons, apples and peaches _ go to the United States and the country
is at the peak of its fruit harvesting season.
   The U.S. and Japanese embassies in Santiago received anonymous
telephone calls earlier this month saying fruit exports would be
poisoned. An investigation turned up nothing, authorities said.
   The Chilean agriculture minister, Jaime de la Sotta, says the
cyanide found in the two grapes in Philadelphia on March 2 amounted
to 0.52 parts per million. U.S. officials said a child would have to
eat 2,000 grapes to ingest a fatal dose.
   Wednesday afternoon, several of the nation's leading fruit
exporters toured the capital's center street with pick-up trucks
loaded with fruit, and gave away grapes and apples to the public.
Hundreds of people enthusiastically ate them. Organizers said the
idea was to show the world Chilean fruit is safe.
   Most Chilean fruit enters the United States through the port of
Philadelphia, others through Miami, Los Angeles and Tampa, Fla.
   Boats containing hundreds of thousands of crates of Chilean fruit
awaited off Tampa as fruit inspections continued.
   In Philadelphia, Food and Drug Administration officials completed
sampling Wednesday of the 362,000 crates of grapes and other fruit
from Chile. No further contamination was found.
   In Chile, the president of the Central Bank, Enrique Seguel,
called the decision to remove the fruit from U.S. stores ``totally
out of proportion.''
   Domingo Duran, president of the National Farm Producers
Association, said nearly 40,000 workers had been laid off by
Wednesday, but union leaders put the figure at 17,000 workers.
   ``The consequences of the thoughtless U.S. decision are worse
than those of several earthquakes,'' Duran told a Wednesday news
conference. ``It is totally irresponsible to react like that because
of two tainted grapes, just two grapes, not two clusters.''
   ``I directly accuse the United States of paving the way to
terrorism against the international food trade in the future,''
Duran said.
   He said the U.S. decision will encourage terrorists in the
future. The Chilean govenment officialy blamed the tainting of the
grapes to ``terrorism backed by the Communist Party.'' The
communists denied the charge.
   Angry reactions came from other quarters, too.
   Alvaro Bardon, president of the state-owned State Bank, called
the U.S. decision ``an agression, almost an act of war.''
   He blamed ``certain sectors of the State Department,'' which he
said were influenced by Chilean opposition politicians.
   Scores of citizens interviewed by radio and TV stations also
strongly criticized the U.S. decision, calling it exaggerated.

   Consumers flocked to organic produce markets
throughout California following reports of tainted Chilean grapes
and unsafe apples.
   ``The Chilean situation on top of the Alar scare boosted sales
phenomenally,'' said Pam Musante, produce manager at the Sacramento
Natural Foods Co-op.
   She said Wednesday that sales of organic produce jumped about 30
percent in the past week.
   Other organic produce markets reported similar increases in sales
as a result of the Chilean fruit scare and a recent report claiming
a cancer risk of a chemical called Alar used on some apples.
   ``We're seeing about 30-35 percent increase in our vegetable
sales and a six-fold increase in sales of organic juices,'' said
Dennis Wells, owner of the Good Nature Grocery in Walnut Creek,
about 20 miles east of San Francisco.
   Real Food Co., which owns six stores in San Francisco and Marin
County, said its sales rose at least 25 percent since both stories
broke.
   The discovery of cyanide in seedless red grapes from Chile, which
followed a threatening phone call to a U.S. Embassy, spurred the
Food and Drug Administration on Monday to recommend that grocers
strip their shelves of fruits imported from that country.
   Meanwhile, a report last month by the private Natural Resources
Defense Council charging that children are at risk from Alar led
schools nationwide _ including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago
and New York _ to ban apples.
   Alar, the brand name for daminozide, is used to improve the
coloring of apples and slow ripening. But it is suspected of causing
cancer.
   In Southern California, Sandy Gooch, an owner of six Mrs. Gooch's
markets, reported record sales. Ted McCaskey, manager of Erewhon
Natural Foods in Los Angeles, estimated a 5 percent increase in
customers.
   Traditionally, organic produce sales have been through farmers'
markets and health food stores, and more recently through grocery
chains.
   ``But there's certainly not enough certified product to handle
the demand,'' said Phil McGee, administrative assistant for Santa
Cruz-based California Certified Organic Farmers, an association of
about 400 growers.
   ``Obviously, there's a big demand for it right now,'' said Mike
Duncan, co-owner of Cal-Organic Farms south of Bakersfield. ``Even
before the publicity there was a steady flow, but now the interest
level has increased drastically.''
   Under California law, produce can be called organic if no
synthetic chemicals have been applied since 12 months prior to
planting or bud break, said McGee.
   The organic farmers group goes even further before certifying a
farm as organic. The process takes at least a year and includes soil
residue analysis, inspection of the farm by an independent
inspector, a notarized affidavit and full disclosure of materials
used in production and a land history for 10 years, McGee said.

<HEAD>Poultry Producer Destroys 400,000 Contaminated Chickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading poultry producer destroyed 400,000
chickens in Arkansas after discovering they were contaminated with a
banned, cancer-causing pesticide, according to a published report.
   Townsend Poultry Products finished destroying the chickens
Wednesday in the most serious incident of pesticide contamination in
the history of Arkansas' $3 billion poultry industry, The New York
Times reported in today's editions.
   The discovery in January of the presence of the pesticide
heptachlor led the company to destroy the chickens over the last
month at its north-central Arkansas plant.
   The contamination was discovered in meat that was being delivered
to the Campbell Soup Co. plant at Fayetteville. The Campbell plant
processes chickens for use in Swanson-brand frozen dinners.
Campbell's routinely tests its meat for about 300 pesticides.
   Campbell discovered levels of helptachlor contamination in the
Townsend chicken ranging from 0.05 parts per million to 2.4 parts
per million in its routine quality control testing.
   The level considered safe by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
is 0.3 parts per million.
   Investigators in the Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug
Administration believe the contamination was caused by sorghum seeds
sprayed with heptachlor and sold illegally as feed grain, the Times
reported.
   ``I've been feeding chickens since 1963, and nothing like this
has ever happened to me,'' said Mary A. Strain, who raises chickens
for the company. ``I'm worried people might get the wrong idea and
stop eating chicken.''
   Government officials said none of the tainted chicken in Arkansas
reached the market, the Times reported.
   The Townsend plant in Batesville, which processes 80,000 to
90,000 chickens a day into parts that are sold in bulk packages,
shut down voluntarily for 11 days.
   Tom Vanemburg, the plant manager, said the Delaware-based company
may spend $3 million to $5 million to recover from the incident. The
chickens that were destroyed were valued at $600,000.
   The company has instituted new procedures that include the
testing of all the grain used in chicken feed and residue tests of
chickens before they are slaughtered, the Times said.
   Heptachlor was banned in the 1970s after it was found to cause
cancer in animals. It was banned for use in food in 1978.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State representatives have approved a bill
that could make Ohio the third state to legalize casino gambling.
   The proposal approved by the House 57-42 Wednesday would limit
the operation to a five-year pilot project in the northeastern Ohio
city of Lorain.
   The bill was sent to the Senate, where a Democratic leader
predicted passage, but Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste refused to
say whether he would approve the proposal.
   Senate Minority Leader Harry Meshel, a Democrat, said he thinks
the bill could provide a badly needed economic boost for northeast
Ohio, ``and I haven't heard a lot of opposition to it. I think it's
going to pass.''
   New Jersey and Nevada are the only states that have legalized
casino gambling.
   Debate in the House involved claims that the bill would damage
the state's image and hurt its economy.
   Republican Rep. James Petro argued that industries considering
locating in Ohio might look elsewhere out of family and community
considerations. Gambling does not provide ``real jobs or real
growth,'' he contended.
   Backers of the legislation said that an envisioned $300 million
casino will have a major impact on the state's economy _ not only in
Lorain but all across northern Ohio, including Cleveland, 40 miles
to the east.
   The bill provides that if voters in Lorain approve of the
venture, the casino would be overseen by a state commission of five
members to be named by the governor.

   Discovery's astronauts today enjoyed
the first home delivery in space of an American newspaper.
   A facsimile machine flying in orbit for the first time was used
to send Discovery a copy of the front page of The Roundup, an
employee weekly at the Johnson Space Center. And it was delivered in
space before it was delivered on the ground.
   The issue had been rushed into print by editor Kelly Humphries so
that it could be sent to the space shuttle today. The paper will not
be distributed on Earth until Friday.
   Discovery astronaut Dr. James M. Bagian stopped his work in space
long enough to read the newspaper and comment to Mission Control.
   ``Thanks for the home paper here, the Roundup,'' he said.
   ``We wanted to tell you that's the first newspaper that's been
sent to an American spacecraft,'' replied Pierre Thuot, capsule
communicator at Mission Control.
   ``It's a good thing that it's you who is there because if it was
Dave (Low) I would expect that he would have sent me up the Wall
Street Journal,'' joked Bagian. Low, who is known to take an
interest in finance, is capsule communicator on an earlier shift.
   The first newspaper in space carried a lead story about the
Discovery launch on Monday and a story at the bottom of the page
about a welcome home ceremony at Johnson for the five-man crew,
which returns on Saturday.
   There also was a story about American-Soviet cooperation in the
exploration of space and a feature about the value of Earth photos
taken by shuttle astronauts.
   The facsimile machine aboard the shuttle is used to send
instructions and daily schedules to the astronauts.

<TEXT>
   A 25-year-old computer hacker once declared
``a very, very great danger to the community'' pleaded guilty to
computer fraud in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors.
   Kevin David Mitnick would be sentenced to 12 months in prison and
three years on supervised release under terms of the agreement.
   The pudgy, youthful looking Mitnick was described by friends as a
computer genius who called himself ``Condor'' and was capable of
infiltrating any computer system.
   Mitnick pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he infiltrated
Digital Equipment Corp.'s computer system and stole one of its
programs, and admitted stealing 16 MCI telephone codes and using
them to make phone calls. It was not clear whether the long distance
codes were used to access computer systems.
   Prosecutors agreed to dismiss two additional charges, one of
which alleged that Mitnick infiltrated the computer system of Leeds
University in England.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer declined prosecutors'
recommendations until Mitnick is interviewed by probation department
authorities. She noted that he has a prior conviction for similar
activities in Santa Cruz, and set sentencing for April 24.
   At a bail hearing on Jan. 3, Pfaelzer denied bail for the
defendant, saying Mitnick posed ``a very, very great danger to the
community'' _ reflecting public comments made by assistant U.S.
Attorney Leon Weidman.
   Even Mitnick's access to the telephone was restricted. Mitnick's
lawyer, Alan Rubin, has maintained that prosecution comments about
the case were wildly exaggerated.
   On Wednesday, Rubin said outside court that Mitnick had expressed
a desire to undergo psychological counseling, which also was part of
the plea agreement.
   ``He's a very talented man with a lot of ability and for whatever
reason ... there's been a misuse of that ability,'' said Rubin. ``A
computer company that could harness his abilities would really get a
talented employee.''
   Rubin said Mitnick never intended to damage computer systems or
to sell information for profit.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger said the government based
its sentencing recommendation on Digital's estimate that Mitnick's
actions had cost the firm between $100,000 and $200,000 in ``down
time'' on its computer.
   He said the computer system had to be shut down while the firm
looked for damage. The government's initial estimates of damage to
Digital's system were set at $4 million.
   It turned out there was no damage to the overall system, Asperger
said, although Mitnick was able to steal and copy one program.
   Mitnick already has served more than three months in prison, and
Rubin added, ``He'll be out by Christmas.''

<HEAD>Japanese Official Recommends Killing More Whales Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's research whaling program is too small to be
scientifically accurate, so more whales should be killed next year,
the head of the program said today.
   Fukuzo Nagasaki, director of the semi-governmental Institute of
Cetacean Research, said the 300 whales being caught by Japanese
ships in the Antarctic this year are not enough to make an accurate
assessment of whale stocks and should be increased to 825 next
season.
   Critics have charged that Japan is using the research program to
continue its whaling industry despite a worldwide moratorium on
commercial whaling imposed in 1986 by the International Whaling
Commission.
   Japan officially ended its commercial whaling at the end of the
1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales. The following season it
told the commission it would kill 875 minke and sperm whales for
research purposes, which are permitted under the commission's
charter.
   But strong opposition from international environmental groups and
some commission members led Japan to cut back the research program's
goal last season to 300 minke whales. Japanese whalers actually
caught 273 minkes during the year, officials say.
   ``The sampling method we applied worked very well, so we are sure
that this method can be applied to somewhat larger-scale research,''
Nagasaki told reporters at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan.
``We are thinking of resuming our original plan from next year if
circumstances permit.''
   The whale meat obtained by Japan's research program is sold for
food, as permitted under International Whaling Commission
regulations.
   The whaling fleet, made up of one mother ship and three catcher
boats, is due to return to Japan from the Antarctic about April 20,
he said.
   The commission passed the whaling moratorium to allow whale
populations to be studied without being hunted. The ban is to be
re-evaluated by the commission next year, and Japan hopes its
research will show that some species, such as the smaller minke, are
plentiful enough to allow a limited resumption of commercial whaling.
   Current estimates of minke populations range from 400,000 to
700,000.

   Communist Party leaders today rallied around
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to give peasants control of
the land they farm and the crops they plant in a drive to overcome
chronic food shortages, Tass said.
   Speakers urged the 300-member Central Committee to approve the
radical reform plan, which Gorbachev said would end decades of
``power and pressure methods'' that have brought disaster to the
Soviet countryside, according to the official news agency.
   In a nearly two-hour speech on Wednesday, Gorbachev painted a
bleak picture of Soviet agriculture, with chemically despoiled land,
investments gone sour and the deliberate destruction of traditional
systems. The situation is so bad that it will be years before the
country can feed itself, he said.
   The Central Committee was expected to approve the policy today,
although conservatives such as agriculture chief Yegor K. Ligachev
have not been enthusiastic about leasing collective farm land to
families and groups.
   Gorbachev's detailed report on years of failed reforms made it
clear that he believes nothing less than radical change will free
Soviets from rationing of meat and cheese now found in many cities.
   His proposal to abolish a government superagency created in 1985
to oversee the country's farm sector was a tacit acknowledgement of
the failure of even his early attempts to revitalize agriculture.
   Essentially, Gorbachev's plan would give farmers freedom to
choose their own crops, equipment and markets. Prices would be
adjusted and eventually nearly decontrolled.
   A draft law on leasing was presented to the party, and Gorbachev
said it could be decreed by the government Presidium. That implied
he would not wait for installation of the nation's new parliament,
which is expected in May.
   It will take time, however, to replace the current system with
one allowing farmers to choose and pay for their own seed, equipment
and fertilizer.
   Leasing experiments have been going on for a year, but approval
of the plan would make leasing standard rather than the exception.
   Gorbachev called food shortages ``our society's biggest wound.''
Meat, sugar and many other foodstuffs must be rationed in numerous
Soviet regions.
   The Central Committee began a two-day meeting Wednesday largely
devoted to agricultural reform, seeking ways to increase the food
supply and improve dreary rural life.
   When Josef Stalin forced agricultural collectivization in the
1930s on a populace that was 80 percent agrarian, millions of
peasants were deported to Siberia and other remote regions or fled
to cities. Catastrophic famine ensued.
   Ever since, farmers working for state-owned farms have generally
delivered their yields to market at fixed prices to meet quotas set
by the state bureaucracy.
   The 58-year-old Gorbachev, the former party overseer for
agriculture and son of a Russian peasant, said conditions in some
rural regions were causing mass migration to cities.
   In 1988, gross Soviet farm output rose by just 0.7 percent, and
grain harvested was only 195 million metric tons, 16 million below
the annual average achieved in 1986-87, according to
Washington-based PlanEcon Inc.
   Gorbachev said lease-holders should be given a virtual free hand.
He has said leasing guarantees higher production because
lease-holders can earn more if they work harder, rather than getting
a fixed salary regardless of output.
   Gorbachev said ``more flexible prices'' for crops purchased by
the state would go into effect Jan. 1, and the number of products
for which prices are fixed would be reduced.
   However, Gorbachev said food shortages could not be expected to
end until the mid-1990s.
   Ligachev has emphasized collective farming _ the system that has
left Soviets standing in line for meat and vegetables.
   No one proposed letting farmers own outright the land, or the
breakup of the collective and state farms that have been the
backbone of the Soviet agricultural system since the 1930s.

<TEXT>
   F0RT WORTH (AP) _ The parent corporation of American Airlines is
constructing a 750,000-square-foot, six-story addition to the
corporate headquarters near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,
company officials say.
   The $95 million office building is being built by AMR Corp., the
airline's parent company, and will increase the size of AMR's
headquarters complex by about one-third.
   Donald J. Carty, American senior vice president, said the new
building is needed to meet the company's growth needs.
   ``Over the last four years, American's employment in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area has increased from about 12,400 employees to
nearly 21,400,'' Carty said.
   Airline spokesman Al Becker said some of the airline's 2,400
employees who will work in the new building will be hired during the
next year and some administrative functions now housed in other AMR
facilities will be relocated when the new building opens next March.
   ``We are reviewing that right now,'' Becker said. ``There are any
number of administrative departments we are looking at moving
there.''
   Completion of the new building will give AMR about 2.5 million
square feet of office space in six buildings at the south end of the
airport.

<HEAD>Fokker Poised To Close $3 Billion Plane Deal With American Airlines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fokker, the Dutch aerospace group
that was near collapse just 16 months ago, is close to wrapping up a
$3 billion deal involving the sale of 150 passenger jets to American
Airlines, a company spokesman confirmed today.
   ``We're discussing the final minor details'' on the deal, valued
at 6.5 billion guilders, or $3.09 billion, said Fokker spokesman
Bart van Veen.
   The sale includes 75 firm orders and 75 options that are to be
placed by the Fort Worth, Texas,-based airline for Fokker's 100-seat
F-100 twin jet, a plane for feeder routes of up to 1,100 nautical
miles, van Veen said.
   It was not immediately known when the contracts would be signed,
van Veen said.
   American's order, considered a crucial breakthrough for Fokker
into the U.S. aviation market, was billed as the largest-ever deal
in Dutch industrial history.
   The deal, which took five years to negotiate, is the latest stage
in the recovery of the Dutch aviation company, which almost
collapsed in 1987 under the financial burden of developing two new
models, the F-100 and the F-50 propjet.
   In a controversial bail-out that year, the Dutch government put
up 212 million guilders to support Fokker. The move, involving the
purchase of Fokker stock at roughly $10 a share, resulted in the
government becoming the majority shareholder with a 31.8 percent
interest.
   ``It looks like the government did a good deal,'' said van Veen,
noting that at midday trading on the Amsterdam bourse, Fokker shares
were up 3.70 guilders to 45.80 guilders, or $21.80 a share.
   Fokker's order books for the F-100 now show 212 firm sales and
178 options, van Veen said, adding that ``American's options may be
described as very firm ones.'' Among other U.S. F-100 buyers is
Washington-based USAir, which has 20 planes on order.
   Van Veen said that since Fokker's Amsterdam production line has
an annual maximum capacity of 46 F-100 jets, ``we're now looking to
expand our production capacity'' in the United States, Northern
Ireland, or at home.
   In the United States, Fokker has had talks with Lockheed Aircraft
Corp., Grumman Corp., and Rockwell International Corp. to set up a
second F-100 production line, while the Dutch company also is
involved in takeover talks concerning Short Brothers Ltd. of
Belfast, Northern Ireland.

   The Contra army stranded near here
may be a headache for diplomats and a political problem in the
United States, but it has also brought a minor economic boom to the
isolated valleys of eastern Honduras.
   ``I'm doing very well. Nowadays all is calm,'' said Eulogio
Chavez Montoya, owner of the Vendita Miraflores store, pointing to
racks of cowboy boots at 80 lempiras each _ about $27 at the black
market rate.
   Buildings throughout town are freshly painted and small stores
are packed with everything from soccer balls to corn flakes.
Families that never had electricity own generators, drink
refrigerated Cokes and watch ``Cagney and Lacey'' via satellite
dishes.
   The boom began a little more than a year ago, when the U.S.
Congress cut military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels trying to topple
the leftist Sandinista government led by President Daniel Ortega.
   The Contras filtered out of Nicaragua as they exhausted supplies;
about 11,000 fighters and thousands of family members now are living
in camps a few miles from the border, supported by U.S. aid.
   Many local Hondurans, who in thploded, killing one of her nieces and
wounding four other children.
   Farther from the camps, the most common complaint about the
Contra presence was drunken driving. ``I guess since they can't
fight they have to entertain themselves,'' said Cesar Rodas, 21, of
Danli.
   Valentin Valladardes, who started a tire repair business in Danli
with a rented air compressor, said he was trying to ride out an
industry shakeout _ too many people competing for truck drivers'
business.
   His wife said Honduran criminals escape justice by joining the
rebels; a Contra mechanic heatedly replied that the Contras are
being blamed for anything that goes wrong within 50 miles.
   The 100 families of Capiri turned into refugees themselves in
1985, when there was frequent fighting in the border region.
   ``We had to get out of here,'' said Jose Medina, a 63-year-old
storeowner. ``Now, there's more confidence in being able to work.''
   ``It's all up to President Bush,'' Medina added. ``Tell him not
to turn up the flame.''

<HEAD>Perfume Czar Hopes To Build House Of Fragrances Starting With 273
Address</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fred Hayman's blueprint for building the first
American ``house of fragrances'' specifies a pyramid-shaped
cornerstone.
   Hayman, the man behind one of the perfume industry's most
successful scents, is introducing a new concoction that he thinks
may create an even bigger splash than Giorgio Beverly Hills.
   His new fragrance is called ``273'' for the address on Rodeo
Drive of the sumptuous Beverly Hills boutique that was the
birthplace of the Giorgio perfume. It comes in a crystal flacon
designed by Hayman in a pyramid shape.
   If his dreams of 273's popularity come true, Hayman says he
intends to expand his fragrance collection under the provisional
banner Clientele Privee, his interpretation of a Parisian perfumery.
   But Hayman doesn't want an exact repeat of the Giorgio success
story.
   That fragrance family, which he sold to cosmetics and toiletries
company Avon for $165 million in 1987, became phenomenally popular
after its debut in 1981. Despite Hayman's emphasis on exclusivity,
Giorgio eventually became widely available in department stores and
elsewhere, losing some allure in the process.
   Hayman says it was difficult to resist demands from retail
outlets clamoring to stock Giorgio.``But I will this time because
I'm convinced small is beautiful,'' says the man who pioneered the
use of ``scent strips'' in magazines, as a come-on for Giorgio.
   At first, 273 will be sold solely through the boutique that has
been rechristened ``Fred Hayman Beverly Hills.''
   It's pricey, having an elevated ``prestige'' status among its
perfume peers. One ounce of the perfume costs $185 and 2.5 ounces of
the cologne goes for $45.
   If demand for 273 takes off, Hayman will face some ticklish
marketing.
   Prestige products pose sales-pitch paradoxes. People who fancy
such goods _ from perfumes to watches to the latest exotic dog breed
_ typically don't want things just anybody can buy.
   So, from a merchandizing standpoint, the problem becomes one of
satisfying demand enough to stimulate interest but not so much that
the product loses the special cachet that scarcity supplies.
   Moreover, the availability of prestige perfumes is overflowing.
Movie stars, from Elizabeth Taylor to Cher, clothing designers and
entertainers have added their own contributions to the gushing
stream of new products.
   A footnote to the recent history of numerous perfume
introductions is the U.S. debut in March of fragrances by Bic Corp.,
of throwaway razor, ballpoint pen and cigarette lighter fame.
   Andrew Shore, who follows the scent business for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., says the lifespan of perfumes is frequently as short as
12 to 24 months. If a fragrance lingers for four years or so, it is
considered a franchise from which successful spinoff products can be
derived.
   ``Incredibly saturated'' is how Shore describes the market,
adding that it is polarized with ultra high-priced items at one
extreme and mass market stuff at the other.
   Unit sales have fallen for the past five years, he says. Modest
growth in sales' value occurred because new fragrances fetch
increasingly higher prices. He estimates retail sales rose to $3.25
billion in 1988, up from $3.15 billion a year earlier.
   Hayman has a simple answer to whether 273 will rise to the top.
   ``There's always a market for the best,'' he said during an
interview while on one of his frequent trips to New York.
   273 is described as a flowery, fruity, spicy blend of more than
250 ingredients, with the key ones being gardenia, tuberose and
jasmine. Its components are expensive and so is its packaging.
   The crystal, pyramid-shaped bottle is embossed with a 24 karat
gold line surrounding the stopper. Bright yellow, reminiscent of the
Giorgio hue and Hayman's favorite color, and fire-engine red are
used for 273, as well as for the Beverly Hills store.
   During a conversation, Hayman, who left his native Switzerland
for the United States in 1941 and speaks Swiss, French and English,
gives the impression he would rather not know the word ``discount''
in any language.
   His boutique, which claims to have the highest sales per square
foot of any store in the country, never marks down prices on
merchandise. For more than 20 years of running the store, Hayman has
had the good fortune to discover little-known designers who
cultivated big followings, such as Halston.
   The boutique was originally called Giorgio by George Grant who
decided to Italianize his name because Italian imports accounted for
much of the clothing carried in the shop. Hayman bought out Grant
and another partner in the mid-1960s.
   Hayman seems to embody Beverly Hills. He owns a vintage Rolls
Royce and is definitely a have, not a have-not.
   Recently, he appeared fit and pleasantly tanned, clad in a
expensively styled suit. Recovering from back surgery required after
years of jogging, he was more comfortable standing through an
hour-long interview in his suite at a chic hotel on the east side of
Manhattan's Central Park.
   When his former wife, Gale, came up with the idea that blossomed
into Giorgio perfume, Hayman was disinterested. ``At first, I
thought it was not a good idea.'' He says he doesn't normally wear
fragrances himself but now the business is in his blood.
   At 63, Hayman says he has no intention of retiring anytime soon
and hopes to establish his Clientele Privee _ French for private
client _ as a perfume powerhouse.

   Stock prices climbed today, propelled by new
evidence of a slackening in economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.21 to 2,322.75 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 438 up, 260 down and
495 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 27.87 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Federal Reserve reported this morning that industrial
production was unchanged in February from the month before.
   A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage
points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's
production facilities.
   Analysts said those figures were read by traders as evidence of
an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on inflation
and interest rates.
   However, brokers also noted persistent uneasiness about Friday's
impending report on the producer price index for February. A 1
percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the
stock and bond markets.
   A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the
``triple witching hour'' taking place on Friday, when the last
trading occurs in a series of stock-index options and futures.
   There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could
produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the
pace of computer program trading by professionals using these
contracts appears to have revived lately.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up \ at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.33 to 167.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .19 at 331.98.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 14.29 to
2,320.54.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 787 up, 596 down and 541 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 167.07 million shares, against 139.97
million in the previous session.

   The Bush administration, which is asking banks
to forgive voluntarily part of the $410 billion debt owed by Third
World countries, opposes establishing an international agency that
could require writing off some of the loans, Congress was told today.
   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford, the principal
architect of the voluntary debt-forgiveness plan, said such an
agency would cause more interruptions in the repayment of loans and
interest and further reduce the value of the loans in secondary
markets.
   Congress last year directed President Reagan to explore setting
up an International Debt Management Authority that could require
renegotiation of the loans on more favorable terms to developing
countries. Many lenders have been able to get only 40 percent of the
loans' face value in selling them to other lenders.
   ``We have concluded after months of study that debt reduction and
debt service reduction can be successfully accomplished in the
marketplace,'' Mulford told the Senate Banking Committee's
subcommittee on international finance and monetary policy.
   ``We believe that (a) market-oriented approach...addresses
congressional concerns with less risk to tax-payers'' than a new
international agency would, he said.
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., praised the
administration for recognizing the necessity of forgiving some of
the debt.
   ``To paraphrase Winston Churchill, this is not so much the
beginning of the end, or even the end of the beginning, but it is
perhaps the beginning of the beginning,'' Sarbanes said.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told the House Ways and Means
Committee on Wednesday that many of the details are likely to be
worked out only after individual negotiations begin with some of the
major Third World debtors, major U.S. economic allies, banks and
international institutions.
   Brady unveiled the plan in a speech last Friday in which he
conceded that the so-called 1985 Baker Plan, named for his
predecessor at Treasury and now Secretary of State James A Baker
III, had largely failed in solving the Third World debt crisis.
   Instead of asking banks to forgive a portion of their loans to
impoverished, debt-saddled nations in Latin America, the Baker plan
called on them to write new loans for countries willing to make
government enterprises private and institute austerity programs.
   Many countries did, but few new loans were written by private
banks. And much of the new money that did come forth from
international lending institutions such as the World Bank was used
by many debtor nations to pay the interest on their loans to private
banks.
   Brady suggested U.S. banks could be encouraged to forgive a
portion of their loans with guarantees that the World Bank or the
International Monetary Fund would provide, if necessary, money to
the debtor countries to make interest payments on their remaining
balances.
   ``At least you're moving in the right direction _ decreasing
their debt instead of increasing it,'' Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., a
member of the Ways and Means Committee, told Brady.
   In outlining the new plan, Brady said only through voluntary debt
and debt-service reduction can some developing countries ever hope
to restore their credit worthiness.
   Bush did not publicly endorse the new plan until Tuesday, raising
questions about whether the initiative was Brady's alone or had the
backing of the full administration.
   Brady acknowledged Wednesday there was some ``confusion'' in the
administration, but said his speech outlining the new strategy had
been approved in advance by the president.
   Major U.S. lender banks have vigorously resisted efforts by some
lawmakers, among them Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., to force them to
write off a portion of their Third World debts.
   ``Across-the-board mandatory solutions are simply not the
answer,'' William Rhodes, head of debt restructuring at Citicorp
told the House Banking Committee earlier this year.
   He said imposed debt forgiveness ``would seriously retard'' the
ability of Third World debtors to return for new loans.
   But with riots two weeks ago in Venezuela over austerity programs
and radical political movements on both the left and right
threatening many fragile Latin democracies, the Bush administration
is now looking at Third World debt as a national security issue as
well as an economic one.
   U.S. banks now hold $97.7 billion of Third World debt, compared
with nearly $140 billion six and one-half years ago when the crisis
was precipitated by Mexico stopping interest payments on its debt
because of plummeting oil prices.
   The six largest borrowers _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico,
Venezuela and the Philippines _ now owe those nine banks some $47
billion, less than the $65 billion of their combined capital bases.

<TEXT>
   It's been a year since rebellious executives
walked out of advertising agency Lord Geller Federico Einstein Inc.
to start their own, a split that has left two emotionally scarred
rivals and courtroom accusations of business sabotage.
   Lord Geller's biggest client, International Business Machines
Corp., took its business elsewhere. A legal dispute on the breakup
remains unresolved. Two agencies now use the Lord name in their
logos.
   Moreover, Lord Geller and the new agency, Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp;
Partners, combined handle only about 60 percent of the business and
employ only about two-thirds as many people as Lord Geller did
before the breakup.
   The saga has drawn attention outside the advertising world
because it has raised questions about the impact of executive
defections in other service industries such as law and accounting.
   Some ad agency folks took delight in the courage the breakaway
executives showed in leaving, citing a desire for autonomy. But at
the same time, they sympathized with those left behind.
   A marketing consultant who advises advertisers about selecting an
ad agency said the lingering legal controversy about the breakup may
be frightening some potential clients from considering either agency.
   ``In making a search for a new agency, a company is looking for a
long term, stable relationship, and I think both agencies at the
moment are viewed as kind of unstable agencies,'' said Stanley
Canter of Canter Achenbaum Associates.
   Lord Geller, however, insists it has stabilized with billings of
$50 million and a payroll of 100 people, down from $212 million in
billings and 320 employees before the breakup.
   Billings reflect the amount of money advertisers pay for
broadcast and published ads. Agencies often get a percentage of
billings for their work.
   Lord Einstein said its growth from zero to $75 million in
billings and 82 employees in its first year makes it one of the
fastest growing startups.
   Of those employed at Lord Geller before the breakup, between 65
and 70 still work there while about 40 are working for Lord
Einstein. About 210 have gone elsewhere, either because they were
laid off or quit.
   Ad industry analysts say the deep pockets of Lord Geller's
parent, the Britain-based WPP Group, may guarantee its survival.
WPP's chief executive Martin Sorrell is believed to be committed to
maintaining Lord Geller as a second ad network separate from WPP's
other agency, J. Walter Thompson Co.
   Lord Einstein also has a powerful partner, the ad agency Young &amp;
Rubicam, which holds a 49 percent stake in the new agency.
   Richard J. Lord helped found Lord Geller Federico Einstein Inc.
in 1967. Five years later, Lord and his partners sold the agency to
J. Walter Thompson.
   The agency probably is best-known for its IBM work, especially
the campaign that used the Charlie Chaplin ``Little Tramp''
character to show how IBM's personal computers can bring order to
the most chaotic businesses.
   Along with Thompson, Lord Geller was purchased as part of WPP
Group's unsolicited $566 million acquisition of JWT Group Inc. in
July 1987.
   Lord and other top executives of Lord Geller chafed under
Sorrell's rule, and after Sorrell rejected a buyout proposal, they
decided to leave.
   On March 18, 1988, Lord and another Lord Geller founder, Arthur
W. Einstein Jr., joined four other Lord Geller executives in the
walkout, leaving only a memo to announce their resignations to the
people they left behind.
   The 63-year-old Lord, whose plans to retire at age 64 were put on
hold indefinitely with the new agency startup, concedes it was ``a
terrible way to do it'' but said his lawyers advised against telling
the staff in person.
   J. William Wardell, the only member of the seven-person
management committee at Lord Geller who did not defect, recalls
hearing a roar build outside his office as copies of the memo were
dropped outside each door.
   He promptly assembled a group to keep the agency running and
contacted clients about what had occurred.
   Within three weeks, Lord Einstein hired about 40 people, most of
them Lord Geller colleagues who wanted to join their old bosses, and
signed ex-Lord Geller clients WNBC-TV and The New Yorker magazine.
   Sorrell sued the defecting managers, accusing them of a
conspiracy to sabotage their old agency. The executives denied it. A
New York state court judge barred Lord Einstein from signing Lord
Geller clients.
   But as of this past week the judge had not entered a final ruling
and had not dealt with the phase of the case in which damages, if
any, will be determined.
   Within a month of the breakaway, Sorrell appointed Wardell as
president of Lord Geller and hired two outsiders to help him run the
agency, Agi Clark of N.W. Ayer and Tim Elliott of Ogilvy &amp; Mather.
   Ms. Clark said she was enticed by the challenge of proving wrong
``everybody who thought it was going to fall apart.''
   In the next few months, Anne Klein II fashions, The Wall Street
Journal and a division of Fuji Photo Film Co. left Lord Geller. But
Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Co. kept its Hennessey cognac there, as did
the Contel Corp. corporate account.
   Lord Einstein, meanwhile, got special projects from IBM with the
court's consent and added a $30 million account from Saab Scania of
North America.
   Both agencies were shut out, however, when IBM took its $100
million account to two other agencies in September. IBM accounted
for about half of Lord Geller's billings.
   Eight days after that decision, Lord Geller laid off 90 people,
trying to cushion the blow by giving fired employees three months
severance pay. Another layoff in December and attrition reduced the
work force further.
   Lord Geller shifted sights to new business. It landed a Lederle
Laboratories drug account, Sheridan home furnishing and Contel
telephone operations. Travel, publishing, computers, fashion and
financial services are areas Lord Geller is pursuing.
   Lord Einstein reached the breakeven point in January, Lord said,
and is on the hunt for clients in food, travel, fashion and high
technology.
   Lord said his group had no way of knowing when they left that his
old agency would lose clients and have to trim the payroll so much.
   ``What we left there was a healthy agency,'' Lord said. He blames
the post-breakup problems on Sorrell.
   But even at that, Lord said he tries to keep tabs on what has
happened to his former employees and said nearly all have found
other ad jobs.
   So how does he feel about having his name on two agency doors?
``I don't feel any better about it than Martin does,'' Lord said.
   Lord Geller considered changing its name but decided against it.
``Our victory will be all the sweeter with the same name,'' said Ms.
Clark.

   The European Economic Community said
Thursday it has frozen talks for a new trade accord with Romania
because of what the economic bloc regards as the country's human
rights abuses.
   EEC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen said
discussions could not go on unless the government in Bucharest
betters its human rights record.
   The EEC has had a trade accord with Romania, covering only
industrial goods, since 1980. In talks for a new pact, the EEC
sought to broaden the accord by adding cooperative ventures and
trade in farm goods.

<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC, the British luxury car maker, said
Thursday its 1988 earnings fell 54 percent because North American
results were hurt by the weak dollar.
   Meanwhile, Jaguar car workers voted to accept the company's
latest pay offer, ending a strike threat at the Coventry plant, the
company said.
   Jaguar said 4,497 workers approved the two-year pay package, and
3,527 rejected it. The company offered rises of about 4.7 percent in
the first year and 4.4 percent in the second, plus bonuses.
   The workers had threatened weekly one-day strikes and refusal to
work overtime.
   In its earnings report, Jaguar said earnings for the year totaled
28.4 million pounds or $48.8 million, equivalent to 27 cents a
share, vs. 61.3 million pounds or $105 million, equivalent to 58
cents a share, in 1987.
   Sales rose 7.3 percent to 1.075 billion pounds or $1.85 billion,
compared with 1.002 billion pounds or $1.72 billion a year earlier,
bolstered by strong sales in Europe and Asia, it said.
   Jaguar said the weak dollar reduced last year's earnings after
taxes by about $77 million.
   Plans to offset the impact of a weak dollar in 1988 ``were only
partially successful,'' the company said. These plans included
increased output and sales, competitive pricing, and higher
productivity.
   Last year, while overall sales rose 8 percent to 51,939 units,
U.S. sales slipped 9 percent to 20,727 units, and Canadian car sales
fell 19 percent to 2,154 units, the company said.
   The company has reduced its dependence on the U.S. market. Last
year, about 45 percent of sales came from the United States,
compared with 65 percent in 1986.
   In Britain, sales rose a strong 31 percent, and sales on the
European continent advanced about 20 percent.
   ``There will be more satisfactory profits in the near future and
we'll be able to tackle challenging exchange rates,'' Chairman John
Egan said.
   ``Faced with the difficult hurdle of exchange rates we are doing
a competent job,'' Egan said. ``But we need to become more efficient
and make sure we become as cost-effective as out key competitors.''
   Jaguar did not provide quarterly or half-year results and is not
required to under British law.

   Iranian said Thursday that new oil
reserves found in the Persian Gulf will help boost Iranian off-shore
oil production to 700,000 barrels a day within four years, state-run
Tehran radio reported.
   A broadcast by state-run Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia,
quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as telling a news conference
that seismic testing in Iranian waters off the coasts of Qatar, Ras
Al Khaimah, Sharjah, Dubai and Saudi Arabia had located huge
reserves of oil and natural gas.
   At their peak in the 1970s, Iran's offshore fields had a total
capacity of more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day. But many
facilities were wrecked during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war with
offshore production falling to its current level of 230,000 barrels
of oil per day.
   Iran has been attempting to rebuild its oil industry since a
United Nations-mediated cease-fire Aug. 20.

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan says federal law
should allow economic considerations to be taken into account in
deciding whether to protect species like the northern spotted owl.
   ``I'm told, on the one hand, that I want to protect an endangered
species,'' he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Wednesday. ``On
the other hand, I hear that's going to devastate the entire
Northwest lumber industry.
   ``How do we solve that problem? I believe we should be able to
take economic considerations into account.''
   Lujan's comments, made in Washington, D.C., came the same day a
federal judge refused to delay the sale of timber on as much as
50,000 acres of U.S. Forest Service land in Washington state and
Oregon that is home to the spotted owl.
   U.S. District Judge William Dwyer's ruling left forest service
plans for protecting the owl in effect pending trial on an effort by
environmentalists to preserve even more habitat. Timber companies
say the current set-asides are excessive.
   The forest service is in the Agriculture Department, outside
Lujan's control. But Lujan said he expects to receive
recommendations May 1 from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on
whether to list the owl as endangered.
   Such a designation, sought by environmentalists to protect
forests in the Pacific Northwest from logging, could mean the loss
of thousand of jobs in the region, timber industry officials have
said.
   ``Maybe we should change the law'' to consider such economic
factors, Lujan said. He added that ``the spotted owl business is
probably the prime example.''
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., responding to a query on Monday, said
a legislative proposal along the lines Lujan suggested on Wednesday
``would create a national furor'' and ``turn the rest of the country
against you.''
   ``I don't think such an effort (to change the Endangered Species
Act) would get anywhere in Congress,'' he said.
   Similar views were expressed by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., whose
district leads the nation in the harvest of national forest timber.
He said log exports rather than environmental laws have caused
domestic timber shortages.
   ``I think there will be a natural, emotional reaction to demand
that the spotted owl be exempt from the Endangered Species Act,''
said DeFazio. ``It's a simple solution _ blame the owl _ but some
people are bashing the environment as a smoke screen.''
   Dwyer also rejected a request by the Washington Contract Loggers
Association to stop the forest service from reducing the allowable
timber cut. That issue, too, should be resolved at trial or in
negotiations, he said.
   The judge asked all parties to state by March 29 what should be
done to resolve the issue. The suit, filed Feb. 8, claimed the
agency's owl management plan failed to set aside enough land to
protect the bird.
   ``I'm really delighted with the decision because it buys us time,
which I feel is what we need,'' said Rep. Jolene Unsoeld.
   Unsoeld said in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C., that
small mill owners, labor and environmentalists have indicated a
willingness to discuss how to maintain a ``sustainable timber
industry, as well as achieve some of the environmental objectives.''
   Todd True, an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,
said environmentalists were reviewing their options.
   ``The biological evidence is that the owl is at the threshold of
extinction and that it can not afford to lose additional habitat,''
he said.
   The forest service plan, approved in December, called for
designation of 374,000 acres of mature and old-growth timber in 13
national forests as habitat for what the agency estimates are 2,000
breeding pairs of spotted owls in Washington and Oregon.

   The Federal Communications Commission today
abolished regulations by which American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
has set long-distance rates for more than two decades.
   The unanimous commission vote, which came after two years of
hearings and filings from consumer groups, Congress and the
telephone industry, would replace AT&amp;T's so-called rate-of-return
regulations on July 1 with a formula designed to drive rates down
and save consumers an estimated $900 million over four years.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick described the commission action as
``a major milestone...in our approach to, our understanding of the
regulatory process.''
   He said it was time to move on from the rate-of-return process
established for the old Bell System in the 1960s.
   ``We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was
crafted in the 1960s, to use that system in the 1990s and beyond. It
is simply outdated,'' he said.
   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said she favored the plan but
with some concern, particularly over a provision that would limit
how far AT&amp;T could lower its long-distance rates. But she said, ``I
do support this grand experiment.''
   Commissioner James Quello also said he had concerns about the
floors on AT&amp;T rates, and said he hoped they could be lifted quickly
in future FCC rulings. But he described rate caps as ``a
precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit the
public.'' He said the rate cap plan was ``long overdue.''
   Patrick said local telephone companies will not come under the
rate cap plan at this point, but that they would be included by July
1, 1990. He said the commission was going to accept further public
comment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plans
to use rate caps by May 17.
   Patrick said he thought he had calmed the waters in Congress over
rate caps, where there has been great concern that residential
consumers would not be well-protected, particularly rural telephone
users.
   Patrick maintains the plan would save consumers $900 million by
letting AT&amp;T establish its interstate prices under a prescribed
formula.
   But the so-called price caps proposal may be derailed in
Congress, where opposition ranges from outright hostility to the
view that the plan could be salvaged if it included better
safeguards for consumers _ particularly rural telephone users.
   Congressional concern over rate caps, which Patrick first
proposed in a speech more than two years ago, caused him to postpone
a vote on the plan in January.
   He tried to assuage congressional concerns about consumers this
week in a lengthy response to a set of questions from Sen. Daniel K.
Inouye, D-Hawaii, who chairs the communications subcommittee of the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
   On the House side, Energy and Commerce Chairman John Dingell,
D-Mich., and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who chairs the
telecommunications and finance subcommittee, have been openly
critical of Patrick's proposal.
   A House subcommittee member, Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., introduced
legislation earlier this month that would prevent implementation of
price caps until Congress can study the proposal more thoroughly.
   Cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that
universal telephone service and subsidies for high-cost telephone
service in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distance
rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas.
   Since the 1960s, AT&amp;T has been subject to so-called
rate-of-return regulation that allows it a certain profit beyond
costs. Currently, AT&amp;T can earn about 12 percent above its expenses.
   Patrick's plan would allow AT&amp;T to raise its rates 3 percent less
than the rate of inflation _ in effect a 3 percent cut _ with an
additional 2 percent reduction for residential and small business
users.
   But if AT&amp;T could lower its expenses under such a system, its
profits would increase.
   Rates would be set on three categories, or ``baskets'' of AT&amp;T
service: residential and small business; 800 services; and all other
business services. Within the residential-small business basket,
prices in the individual categories could not increase by more then
5 percent plus the change in inflation rate.
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said at a hearing last month on the
plan that the FCC should require AT&amp;T to share with customers half
of any windfall profits arising from the plan.
   Another subcommittee member, Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, said the
revised plan had removed ``floors'' on prices in each of the
categories. The plan, as outlined by Patrick, only would maintain
ceilings on how high such prices could go.
   Tauke said that without floors AT&amp;T possibly could lower prices
far enough to drive out competition, but Patrick said floors could
discourage AT&amp;T from increasing efficiency to lower prices.
   Patrick's plan would cover all dominant interstate carriers. For
AT&amp;T specificially, it would cap prices for a period of four years.
   The 3 percent reduction would be imposed after adjustments for
cost changes outside of AT&amp;T's control, such as the charges that
local phone companies require AT&amp;T to pay to connnect with the local
phone networks.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mixed to
slightly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The possibility of broken contracts were blamed for the early
downside pressure on both commodities. A report in the bean pits was
that Pakistan would not follow through on a 99,000-ton purchase of
soy oil, and that gloom spread across the bean market.
   Traders said wheat should have received some support after a
one-day tour of the Kansas fields showed the winter wheat crop in
poor shape. But dampening any upside move was a rumor that China
will cancel a 270,000-ton buy of new-crop wheat.
   On the open, wheat was unchanged to 1\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery at $4.38{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to
{ cent higher, with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents
lower to unchanged, with March aqt $2.07 a bushel; and soybeans were

   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent to .77 cent lower, with April at 77.20
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent to .60 cent lower, with
March at 80.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .65 cent lower to .15

   Stock prices pushed ahead today, propelled by new
evidence of a slackening in economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.28 to 2,329.82 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 739 up, 538 down and
539 unchanged.
   The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production was
unchanged in February from the month before.
   A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage
points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's
production facilities.
   Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence
of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on
inflation and interest rates.
   However, brokers also noted a persistent mood of caution about
Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February.
A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the
stock and bond markets.
   A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the
``triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs
in a series of stock-index options and futures.
   There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could
produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the
pace of computer program trading by professionals using these
contracts appears to have revived lately.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up \ at
46[; USX, up { at 32|, and International Business Machines, up 1[ at
118[.
   Pacificorp was actively traded, up } at 34}. The stock was added
to Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index, prompting buying by
funds set up to parallel the performance of the index.
   TW Services climbed 2{ to 31|. The company asked its investment
bankers to investigate alternatives to a $29-a-share takeover bid by
Coniston Partners.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.68 to 167.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .09 at 331.70.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 89.51 million shares at noontime,
against 81.22 million at the same point Wednesday.

Thomson earnings. All dollar figures are U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two newspaper-based conglomerates controlled by
Canada's Thomson family announced Wednesday they plan to merge
operations into a giant media company worth about $7.5 billion.
   The merger is subject to approval by minority shareholders in the
two companies, Thomson Newspapers Ltd. and International Thomson
Organisation Ltd.
   The Thomson family controls 61 percent of Thomson Newspapers Ltd.
, which publishes 40 Canadian daily newspapers and 116 dailies in
the United States. Family members control 73.5 percent of
International Thomson Organisation Ltd., with newspaper and other
media interests in Britain and the United States.
   The new company to be called Thomson Corp. will have a head
office in Toronto and an executive office in New York City,
officials said at a news conference.
   The merged company would have had 1988 sales of $4.7 billion,
earnings from continuing operations of $380 million and net income
of $436 million.
   The companies expect to have a detailed proposal within 30 days
on how to carry out the merger. Officials said Ken Thomson, who now
chairs each company, would be chairman of Thomson Corp. and top
management would remain.
   ``The merger will capitalize on the unique strengths of Thomson
Newspapers and International Thomson to build a combined
organization with even stronger foundations and better future
prospects,'' Ken Thomson said in a release.
   Together the companies employ more than 40,000 people, including
5,700 in Canada. No jobs will be eliminated in the merger, officials
said.
   The merger ``will assure that we can more efficiently pursue
further organic growth and acquisitions in both daily newspapers and
specialized information and publishing businesses,'' Ken Thomson
said.
   Separately, International Thomson _ which also has interests in
travel and airline businesses _ reported its profit rose 23.8
percent in the year ended Dec. 31.
   International Thomson reported earnings of $229 million for the
year on sales of $3.74 billion up from a profit of $185 million on
sales of $3.11 billion a year earlier.
   Operating profit was up by 25 percent in the information and
publishing segment and 30.4 percent in the leisure travel business.
   International Thomson completed the sale of its oil and gas
interests to Lasmo North Sea PLC completed March 6. The company
previously announced it had an estimated gain of $475 million from
the sale.

   The futures industry will ultimately be
strengthened if its leaders take a direct approach to issues raised
by a federal investigation of commodity trading fraud, the head of
the industry's largest trade association said today.
   ``We can't make the Chicago investigation go away; but in the end
it will become one of those events in our history which hardens the
steel from which we will build the futures industry of the 1990s,''
said David Ganis, chairman of the Futures Industry Association.
   In his keynote speech at the opening of the group's annual
meeting here, Ganis said the Futures Industry Association ``is
committed to promoting the highest ethical standards within the
industry and will support all appropriate actions to protect the
interest of the ... customers who rely on these markets.
   ``Trust is the very cornerstone of our ability to do business,''
Ganis told more than 1,000 brokerage executives, exchange officials
and regulators attending the meeting at the posh Boca Raton Hotel
and Club.
   The meeting follows by two months the disclosure of an undercover
federal probe of suspected fraud at the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's two largest futures
exchanges.
   No charges have yet been issued in connection with the probe.
Anton Valukas, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, would not comment on
rumors circulating among defense lawyers that six people would soon
be charged.
   The probe is believed to be targeting as many as 100 traders
suspected of systematically cheating customers out of millions of
dollars while executing their orders on the trading floors of the
two Chicago exchanges.
   Futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and financial
instruments at a specified price on a future date.
   The investigation has focused attention on certain trading
practices that can lead to cheating, critics say.
   Chief among these is dual trading, the long-established practice
among floor brokers of trading for their own accounts and their
customers' accounts at the same time.
   Ganis said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal
regulatory agency, has asked his association to submit its own
analysis of dual trading. The CFTC is seeking similar responses from
futures exchanges in Chicago and New York.
   Ganis, who heads Northern Futures Corp., a Chicago-based futures
brokerage, also said the federal investigation ``calls into question
the adequacy'' of self-regulation of the futures industry.
   Under the existing self-regulatory system, the CFTC allows
individual exchanges to make and administer their own trading rules.
   CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm, who also spoke at the the meeting this
morning, said self-regulation had worked well in the past and called
for renewed diligence among futures exchanges and brokerage firms in
detecting and punishing wrongdoing.
   ``I know that you have the incentive to root out fraud and abuse
in these markets,'' she said. ``So do we and we will continue to be
aggressive in this regard.''

   Southern catfish farmers, long unable to penetrate
the huge but finicky New England seafood market, are finally winning
over Yankees by abandoning the hush puppy approach in favor of
lemon-pepper marinade and recipes like catfish and artichoke au
gratin.
   Using a traveling chef to tout nouvelle catfish, the nation's
largest processor, Delta Pride Catfish Inc. of Indianola, Miss.,
says it has tripled sales in New England during the last six months.
   ``Down South, it's catfish, hush puppies, cole slaw and french
fries,'' Delta Pride President Sam Hinote said at a recent
fish-industry trade show in Boston. ``But we know that just doesn't
go up here.''
   What does go, said Lisa Martel, executive chef at Rebecca's
Restaurant on Beacon Hill, is catfish in lemon-caper beurre blanc.
   ``We've had it on the menu for four months,'' Ms. Martel said.
``At first it wasn't really accepted, but now it's selling very
well.''
   Southern farmers, searching for an alternative to depressed row
crops like cotton and soybeans, began raising catfish in shallow,
fresh water ponds in the early 1970s.
   Production has grown at a compound rate of more than 30 percent a
year, from fewer than 5 million pounds in 1970 to more than 295
million in 1988, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show.
   In Mississippi, where 85 percent of the nation's catfish are
raised, more than 7,000 people now work in the industry. Retail
sales in restaurants and supermarkets, estimated at about $10
million in 1970, topped $600 million last year.
   Almost all of those sales, however, were in the South and
Midwest. Although New Englanders are the nation's largest per capita
consumers of seafood, they have long spurned catfish _ a fact that
Delta Pride, ConAgra Inc. and other major processors realize they
must reverse if they are to continue their rapid growth.
   ``People up here still think catfish are the ugly old things that
Huck Finn pulled off the bottom of the Mississippi,'' said Hinote.
``If we had the image of, say, rainbow trout, we'd be selling
billions of pounds, not millions.''
   Delta Pride's touring chef, John Folse, is trying to capture that
clean, upscale image with recipes like grilled fillet of catfish
with dijon mustard, catfish and artichoke au gratin, and cajun
catfish with oysters and andouille sausage.
   ConAgra's Country Skillet Catfish division, meanwhile, is
breaking into the New England market with pre-marinated packs of
fish in flavors like cajun, lemon-pepper and mesquite.
   Two years ago, Delta Pride, a member-owned cooperative of 188
catfish farmers in Mississippi and Arkansas, sold virtually no fish
in New England. Now, it sends two tractor trailers a week to the
Boston area, delivering about $60,000 worth of fish at wholesale
prices.
   ConAgra's catfish division, based in Isola, Miss., declined to
provide comparable figures. But its Northeast sales manager, Bill
Farr, said sales in the six-state region have doubled in the past
year and are ``going up fast.''
   Both companies said they have been helped by publicity about
diseased flounder and tainted shellfish pulled from Boston Harbor
and other polluted New England waters.
   ``The thing about catfish is, it's raised in well water and fed
on pellets of soybean and corn meal that are certified free of
toxins,'' said Bill Allen Jr., president of the Catfish Institute, a
trade association in Belzoni, Miss. ``With all the concern about
ocean pollution, the timing for catfish should be perfect.''
   For retailers, catfish also has two other advantages _ a steady,
year-round supply and constant prices, averaging between $4 and $5 a
pound at retail outlets in New England, said Kenneth Howe, seafood
sales manager for Stop &amp; Shop Inc., a chain of 115 supermarkets in
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
   When Stop &amp; Shop first began carrying catfish three years ago,
Howe said, ``there was a lot of resistance.'' After heavy
advertising, cooking demonstrations and sales promotions, sales
picked up _ but they still don't rival traditional favorites like
cod and haddock.
   ``People like catfish,'' Howe said. ``But this is still good old
New England.''

<TEXT>
   Shenanigans of television evangelists such
as Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker have spawned another player in
America's multimillion-dollar board game industry, named ``Fleece
the Flock.''
   The game, scheduled to be in stores next month, is marketed by
Regent Continental, a Philadelphia-based company that produces board
games for some of the nation's largest toy makers, including
``Monopoly,'' ``Clue,'' and ``Sorry'' for Parker Brothers.
   ``I came up with the idea when Jimmy Swaggart was caught in the
motel,'' said Elizabeth Fuller, author of ``My Search for the Ghost
of Flight 401'' and other books. ``I thought, `These guys belong on
a board game.'''
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is based loosely on ``Monopoly,'' but
instead of real-estate tycoons, players assume the roles of greedy
evangelists.
   Armed with collection plates, players toss dice and seek
ownership of theme parks, television stations and record companies
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own
sexual escapades secret.
   Fuller, who lives in Weston, Conn. collaborated on the game with
inventor Stanley Mason of Weston, whose 30 patents include Masonware
microwave cookware, and Roy Doty of Norwalk, Conn., a humor
illustrator whose work has appeared in Newsweek, Fortune and Popular
Science magazines.
   The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions for this venture and
sold the rights to market the game to Regent.
   The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at
$25 retail, available by April 1, said Cindy Levinson, the Regent
account executive who is marketing ``Fleece the Flock.''
   The company will focus its sales campaign on the Northeast at
first, but hopes to convince nationwide chains to carry the game,
she said.
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalize
on people in the news. Milton Bradley, maker of the some of the
country's most popular games, last month unveiled ``Trump The
Game,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate
mogul Donald Trump.
   Analysts say any new entry into the $760 million-a-year
board-game industry faces an uphill battle.
   ``More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not
make it past that year's Christmas,'' said David S. Leibowitz, a toy
industry analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York. ``The
success of any new toy item is pretty tough.
   ``Board games tend to have a more difficult time than many other
products because there is a set of rules to be mastered, and the
competition is far keener because many people believe they can in
fact create a board game.''
   Board games face additional difficulties of requiring more than
one person and a considerable block of time to play, he said.
   But Fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that
Americans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of
television evangelists will create a niche for their game.
   ``The No. 1 one thing the American public is interested in right
now are TV evangelists gone astray _ not movie stars, not rock
stars,'' Fuller said.
   The three spent five months testing the game on groups of
volunteer players, who were observed at Mason's product development
laboratory in Weston.
   They went through nine versions of the board and even more
changes in the rules, which come in the form of the Ten
Commandments, before settling on the final version.
   The inventors were dumbfounded to discover one common trait among
the test players: They all were cheating by the end of the game. The
phenomenon prompted the inclusion of one rule that is assumed in
most games: ``Thou shalt not cheat (unless thou canst get away with
it).''
   No real-life evangelist is named in the game and the inventors
insist they are not attacking religion itself. Fuller is a
Unitarian; Doty and Mason are Methodists.
   ``It's a comment on humanity,'' Mason said. ``It's aimed at the
human foibles we have, when we'll suppport people like this when we
know...they are evil.''

   The Federal Communications Commission today
abolished regulations by which American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
sets long-distance rates, replacing them with a formula designed to
save consumers $900 million over four years.
   However, some members of Congress have said the plan, favored by
AT&amp;T, could lead to price increases, particularly for consumers in
rural areas.
   The unanimous commission vote will replace AT&amp;T's so-called
rate-of-return regulations on July 1 with a plan that would tie
long-distance prices to the rate of inflation.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick described the commission action as
``a major milestone'' in telephone regulation.
   He said it was time to move on from the rate-of-return process
established for the old Bell System in the 1960s. Under that system,
AT&amp;T was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs, which
Patrick says provided an incentive for padding costs.
   ``We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was
crafted in the 1960s, to use that system in the 1990s and beyond. It
is simply outdated,'' he said.
   Currently, AT&amp;T can earn about 12 percent above its expenses. The
new plan willallow it to raise its rates for all customers to 3
percent less than the rate of inflation. An additional 2 percent
reduction would be allowed for residential and small business users.
   For instance, if the inflation rate were 4 percent, AT&amp;T could
raise its long-distance rate 1 percent overall, but residential and
small business users would get a 1 percent decrease at that
inflation rate.
   Rates would be set on three categories of AT&amp;T service:
residential and small business, 800 services, and all other business
services. Within the residential-small business category, prices of
particular services such as night and weekend calling could increase
no more than 1 percent a year.
   Critics of the plan note that AT&amp;T's long-distance rates have
decreased 38 percent since divestiture in 1984 due to a reduction in
service costs. They say prices will not fall as quickly under the
new system as they would under the old one.
   Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis said she supported ``this grand
experiment'' of price-cap regulation but had some concern,
particularly over a provision that would limit how far AT&amp;T could
lower its long-distance rates.
   Commissioner James Quello also said he was concerned about that
feature and hoped it could be eliminated soon. But he described rate
caps as ``a precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit
the public.''
   Patrick said local telephone companies will not come under the
rate cap plan at this point, but that they would be included by July
1, 1990. He said the commission was going to accept further public
comment on that issue and asked the local companies to submit plans
to use rate caps by May 17.
   BellSouth, one of the seven regional companies created in the
1984 breakup of AT&amp;T, said the commission ``took an important step
to benefit consumers in a substantial way'' with today's action, but
it said savings would have been greater had the commission applied
the new rules to local companies this year instead of in 1990.
   Patrick said he thought he had calmed the waters in Congress over
rate caps, where there has been great concern that residential
consumers would not be well-protected, particularly rural telephone
users.
   Congressional concern over rate caps, which Patrick first
proposed in a speech more than two years ago, caused him to postpone
a vote on the plan in January.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., a member of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, introduced legislation earlier this
month to prevent implementation of price caps until Congress can
study the proposal more thoroughly.
   Cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that
uniervice in remote areas would be maintained and thast telephone
service in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distance
rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas.
   Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said at a hearing last month on the
plan that the FCC should require AT&amp;T to share with customers half
of any windfall profits arising from the plan.
   Patrick bowed to congressional pressure and put in limits on how
low rates could go. Without such floors, AT&amp;T might be able to lower
prices enough to drive out competition, the critics said.
   The 3 percent rate cap would be imposed after adjustments for
cost changes outside of AT&amp;T's control, such as the charges that
local phone companies require AT&amp;T to pay to connnect with the local
phone networks.

<HEAD>Tyson Increases Offer for Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods Inc., the largest poultry
producer in the country, on Thursday sweetened its offer for Holly
Farms by more than $60 million to total $1.11 billion cash.
   The raised offer, from $60 a share to $63.50, came a few weeks
before Holly Farms shareholders were scheduled to meet to consider a
rival deal with ConAgra Inc., to acquire Holly Farms in a stock swap
valued at $1 billion.
   Holly Farms, based in Memphis, Tenn., has been fighting Tyson's
attempted takeover since last fall. The company's board said it
would consider Tyson's latest offer ``in due course,'' but asked
shareholders not to tender their shares to Tyson until the board
made a final recommendation.
   Tyson had earlier told Holly's board that Tyson was willing to
pay $63.50 a share for Holly stock. The latest offer, Tyson said,
was contingent on termination of the Holly-ConAgra deal.
   The Springdale-based poultry giant already has asked a state
court in Delaware _ where Holly Farms is incorporated _ to nullify
the ConAgra-Holly Farms deal or to hold a hearing on the
appropriateness of the proposal.
   Under the proposal, ConAgra would be able to buy certain Holly
Farms assets even if the merger failed.
   Don Tyson, chairman and chief executive officer, also released a
letter he sent to the Holly Farms board concerning the $63.50 offer
to Holly Farms shareholders.
   ``Obviously this increase should eliminate your continued and
erroneous assertions that Tyson was not, and is not committed to
acquiring all outstanding Holly common shares at $63.50 per share,''
Tyson said. ``Moreover, this represents deliverable real value to
your stockholders if _ instead of thwarting a decision on the
lock-ups by the Delaware Chancery Court by favoring a ConAgra
transaction _ you would join with us in expeditiously seeking the
court's determination.''
   Tyson said its tender offer for Holly common shares has been
extended until March 31. The release said that, as of the close of
business Wednesday, Tyson had received tenders of approximately 1.3
million common shares of Holly Farms.
   The target company has about 17.44 million shares outstanding,
making the total value of Tyson's latest offer worth $1.11 billion.

   The Chilean foreign minister said today after
meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III that he is
confident a solution can be found to the problems arising after a
U.S. government warning that citizens should not eat Chilean fruit.
   ``We are confident that with a joint effort we can have a
solution,'' the foreign minister, Hernan Felipe Errazuriz told
reporters. He described his meeting with Baker as ``very
constructive'' and said, ``We need an urgent solution today.''
   Baker, responding to Chilean anger over the U.S. government
warning, said the action was not taken on political grounds.
   ``It has been taken strictly as a health and safety measure and
we think the foreign minister understands that,'' Baker said.
   He added that Chilean officials and those from the Food and Drug
Administration were discussing possible solutions, but did not
describe what options were under consideration.
   A joint statement issued after the State Department meeting said
the two sides agreed to work together on an urgent basis to resolve
the problem.
   The Chilean side expressed deep concern over the country's heavy
financial losses, noting that 200,000 workers and their families
``face unemployment and even destitution,'' the statement said.
   Baker responded that U.S. industry and consumers were being
harmed as a consequence of ``the despicable act'' of those
responsible for poisoning the fruit.
   An FDA spokesman said the agency weighed economic as well as
health concerns when it decided to warn the public about the
possible poisoning of Chilean fruit, an agency spokesman said.
   Such a decision ``has great economic potential'' to harm the
South American country that exported $581 million in fruit worldwide
last year and hopes to export $850 million worth next year, said
spokesman Don McLearn.
   On the other hand, ``you had a probable confirmation'' that
cyanide found in two red seedless grapes from Chile ``was a
tampering, not a hoax.''
   ``Then, how far do you go with a decision based on that evidence?
That's very tough,'' he said.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young's decision was to warn consumers not
to eat any Chilean fruit _ which includes virtually all fresh grapes
sold in U.S. markets at this time of year _ and to urge stores to
remove all Chilean fruit from their shelves.
   Supermarkets reacted quickly, and today produce shelves remain
empty of Chilean fruit. Many stores have posted signs assuring
customers that the fruit on display didn't come from Chile.
   At ports in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami, tons of Chilean
grapes, pears, raspberries, watermelons and other non-citrus fruit
were being held under refrigeration while tests on the produce
continued.
   No further contamination has been found, the FDA said.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials have been meeting through the week with
representatives of the Chilean government and U.S. fruit importers
to develop a plan that would ``do the least economic damage (to
Chile) and assure the safety of the fruit supply,'' McLearn said.
   The FDA's warning to consumers appeared to come some 24 hours
after FDA inspectors discovered two suspicious-looking red grapes
that tests later confirmed to contain traces of cyanide, according
to a chronology outlined by McLearn.
   The chain of events began March 2 when the U.S. embassy in
Santiago received a call from a Spanish-speaking male who threatened
to inject cyanide into Chile's export fruit.
   A government source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, has
said the caller indicated in his threat that his motive was ``to
focus attention on the lower classes of Chile.''
   The message was passed to the U.S. Customs Service, which began
detaining ships with Chilean fruit at U.S. ports.
   The FDA learned of the threat late in the afternoon on Friday,
March 3, McLearn said. The following day, Young called in a group of
FDA officials to talk about the situation, said McLearn, who
attended the meeting that lasted into the evening.
   Young decided the detention by the Customs Service should
continue through the weekend, while he talked to officials at the
State Department and Customs, the Chilean ambassador and fruit
importers ``to try to figure out the magnitude of this and grapple
with the decision of what to do,'' McLearn said.
   But by the end of the weekend, the State Department had concluded
the threat was a hoax, he said.
   ``We felt at that point there was no reason for a full detention
but that we would do surveillance,'' McLearn said. ``At that point
we were prepared to let the fruit through,'' and issued a release
about the hoax.
   A story about the determination that the call had been a hoax
appeared in a Santiago newspaper, and on March 8, the caller _ ``we
assume it was the same guy,'' the FDA spokesman said _ phoned the
embassy again and said the threat was not a hoax.
   The FDA heightened its inspections at the U.S. ports, the
spokesman said.
   Most of the fruit enters through the port at Philadelphia, and
there the Almeria Star had just arrived with the next major import
from Chile, he said. It was on that ship that inspectors, making a
visual inspection last Sunday, found two discolored grapes that had
crystalline rings around puncture marks.
   The grapes were sent to an FDA laboratory in Philadelphia, which
made an initial finding that the grapes contained cyanide. They then
were sent to another FDA lab in Cincinnati, which confirmed traces
of the poison in the grapes, McLearn said.

<HEAD>Ad Spending in Newspapers Rose 6.1 Percent in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spending for newspaper advertising rose 6.1
percent to an estimated $31.2 billion in 1988, the smallest
percentage gain in 13 years, an industry-backed research
organization said Thursday.
   The increase was down from a 9.0 percent rise in 1987 and was the
smallest advance since a 5.0 percent rise in the recession year of
1975.
   The Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. said preliminary estimates
indicate spending for retail advertising, the largest category for
newspapers, rose 4.0 percent to $15.84 billion last year.
   Classified ad spending rose 10.1 percent to $11.77 billion and
national ad spending was up 2.6 percent to $3.59 billion.
   Media analysts have blamed the sluggish growth in retail ad
spending partly on recent consolidation in the retailing business.
   They said retailers also were reluctant to boost ad spending in
the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash because of
uncertainty earlier in the year about how the crash would affect
consumer spending patterns.
   Retail ad spending grew only 1.7 percent in the second quarter of
1988, for instance, but picked up in the last half of the year,
rising 4.4 percent in the third quarter and 5.2 percent for the
fourth quarter.
   Overall ad spending in newspapers was up 6.6 percent in the
fourth quarter.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in
light, quiet trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders said tenders that may have gone unbought were responsible
for early downside moves by both the grains and beans, and may have
set the tone in the absence of any fresh news the rest of the day.
   Pakistan apparently canceled overnight on a 99,000-ton purchase
of soy oil, and that spread pressure across the bean market. But
expectations the Pakistanis might return to the market and light
cash sales of beans around the country provide some underpinning
through the rest of the day.
   Traders expected wheat to move upward after a one-day tour of the
Kansas fields concluded recent dry weather had harmed the winter
wheat crop. But dampening any upside move was a rumor that China
will cancel a 270,000-ton buy of new-crop wheat.
   On the close, wheat was \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher, with the

   Assets of the nation's 460 money market mutual
funds rose $1.26 billion in the latest week to a new all-time high
of $296.55 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise n the seven-day period ended Wednesday, followed a $1.25
billion increase in the funds' assets the previous week, according
to the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   It was the tenth straight weekly all-time high for money market
mutual fund assets reported by the trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 228 general purpose funds rose $913 million to $96.11
billion, assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased $565 million to
$127.96 billion, and assets of 138 institutional funds decreased
$213.6 million to $72.47 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.85 percent from 8.75 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.68 percent from 8.58 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 32
days, up from 31 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.50 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.48 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective

<HEAD>Navy Suspends Contract Bidding by Three Unisys Units</HEAD>

   The Navy on Thursday suspended three units of
Unisys Corp. from bidding on or receiving federal contracts in the
latest action stemming from an investigation of alleged defense
contract fraud.
   The Navy said it was suspending the bidding rights of the
Shipboard and Ground Systems Group, the Computer Systems Division
and the Communications Systems Division of Unisys, ``to protect the
government's interests.''
   Unisys is a computer giant created by the 1986 merger of Sperry
Corp. and Burroughs Corp. All three units suspended Thursday were
once part of Sperry.
   According to latest statistics, Unisys is the nation's 15th
largest defense contractor, having received $1.4 billion in work in
fiscal 1988. The Navy's suspension, however, applies to any contract
with a federal agency and not just military contracts.
   Pentagon and Navy officials were unable to say immediately how
much business the three divisions did with the federal government.
   Peter Hynes, a Unisys spokesman in Blue Bell, Pa., said Thursday
the three suspended units performed about $1.6 billion worth of
federal government work last year. Unisys as a whole is a $9.9
billion corporation, he said. He added that the suspensions won't
affect the company's commercial computer sales to the government or
industry because those are handled by other units.
   Hynes added Unisys was ``confident that by working with the Navy
to confirm compliance to rules and by making any additional changes
if appropriate, the suspension can be removed rapidly.''
   The suspension came less than a week after a former Unisys vice
president and former Unisys consultant pleaded guilty in federal
court in Alexandria, Va., to trying to bribe former Navy officials.
   Another Unisys executive and a second Unisys consultant entered
guilty pleas on Jan. 27 to making illegal campaign contributions to
members of Congress.
   The pleas were part of the federal government's 2{-year
investigation into the Pentagon's $150-billion-a-year procurement
practices. The probe is code-named ``Operation Ill Wind.''
   The probe includes allegations that private consultants, hired by
defense contractors, bribed Pentagon officials to obtain inside
information that gave companies an edge in securing contracts.
   Citing the guilty pleas and a confidential investigative report
prepared by Unisys, the Navy said Thursday the suspensions were
justified by the ``egregious nature'' of the misconduct.
   ``The misconduct involves expense account abuses, improper use of
consultants for lobbying purposes, improper corporate campaign
contributions and bribery of government officials,'' it said.
   The service, as usual in the case in such disciplinary moves,
gave no indication how long the suspensions might last. It did say,
however, the management of Unisys had been vigorous in investigating
the allegations and in putting in place a new management program
``to guard against such abuses in the future.''
   ``Notwithstanding the actions on the part of Unisys, in light of
the number of instances of misconduct at former Sperry divisions;
the egregious nature of the misconduct, and the fact that new
instances of wrongdoing pertaining to the ongoing `Ill Wind'
investigation continue to surface, the Navy has determined that the
former Sperry divisions need to be suspended to protect the
government's interests,'' the service said.
   ``Evidence that the policies and procedures of Unisys are
understood and followed by these divisions is necessary, and Unisys
must perform some additional internal audits across the affected
divisions to verify that the types of improper conduct in evidence
... are not pervasive elsewhere within the company,'' it said.

   Spring break has arrived and college kids are
rolling out the barrels.
   But Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., parent of the world's largest
brewery, is urging restraint. The company spends millions of dollars
each year promoting what it calls ``responsible-drinking'' programs.
   Some are considered particularly relevant this time of the year,
when students descend upon resort cities from Miami to Palm Springs
and indulge in brew-guzzling marathons that aren't particularly
welcomed by the locals.
   Entertainer Sonny Bono, mayor of Palm Springs for the past 10
months, said his city's residents have long tried to curb the level
of alcohol consumption during spring break.
   ``A couple of the events are cruising and drinking and getting
out of hand,'' Bono said. ``For the locals, it's a time we dread.''
   Enter Anheuser-Busch, which tries to get its message across
before the students hit town. On campuses across the country,
college newspapers advertise ``Pit Stops'' where students en route
to spring break destinations can pull over and get a doughnut and a
cup of coffee.
   ``Here it's someone selling alcohol and saying `Don't abuse it
and don't get carried away,''' Bono said. ``I like it.''
   The St. Louis-based brewing giant says it is committed to keeping
customers from over indulging. The number of responsible-drinking
programs sponsored by the company nearly equals the number of its
brands.
   Choices include Budweiser, Bud Light, Busch, Natural Light,
Michelob, Michelob Dry and L.A. To keep thirsty drinkers in line,
the company offers programs such as the Your Alcohol IQ videotape,
Know When to Say When, The Buddy System, Good Sport, TIPS, I'm
Driving, and Alert Cab.
   Anheuser-Busch sold 78.5 million barrels of beer last year, 41.1
percent of the total brewing industry sales nationwide. But for more
than a decade, the brewery hasn't been content to simply sell beer
in record quantities.
   According to a recent Fortune Magazine survey, Anheuser-Busch
ranks first among beverage companies in responsibility to the
community and environment.
   ``I don't know if social conscience is the right word,'' said
Stephen K. Lambright, vice president and group executive at
Anheuser-Busch, who oversees the company's responsible-drinking
programs. ``It's a social commitment. We hope to be part of the
solution. Hopefully, what we're doing is something that's more than
just a PR piece.''
   At first glance, Anheuser-Busch's sobriety theme in the spring
break pilgrimage south by winter-weary college kids might have the
unwanted side effect of forfeiting part of this lucrative market.
But it appears far more successful than the sophomoric partying
theme by rival Miller Brewing Co.
   Miller recently scrapped what it now concedes was a poor-taste ad
campaign for spring-break getaways after college students complained
it was sexist and they threatened to boycott Miller products. The
brewer's supplements in college newspapers last month featured
pictures of bikini clad coeds clutching Miller bottles and tips for
men on ``sure fire ways to scam babes.''
   Anheuser-Busch doesn't have anything as easy as a barrel count to
determine the success of its responsible drinking program.
Lambright, however, pointed out that the number of underaged beer
drinkers and fatalities in alcohol-related accidents both have
decreased in recent years.
   ``We certainly don't have all of the answers, but the statistics
are all moving in the right direction,'' Lambright said. ``The
system is getting better.''
   Among the company's programs, and advertisements touting them:
   _ At sports events, messages from professional athletes are
beamed on the big screen, and billboards remind the fans to be a
``Good Sport'' and not over indulge.
   _ At local video stores, L.A. Law stars Jill Eikenberry and
Michael Tucker are featured in the brewery's newest program, ``Your
Alcohol IQ.'' Anheuser-Busch distributed 25,000 free copies to video
outlets nationwide.
   _ And who hasn't seen Spuds MacKenzie and the Spudettes advising
television watchers to moderate their alcohol intake?
   The concept of a beer company advising restraint in the
consumption of its products isn't all that new anymore.
Anheuser-Busch says its first programs began in the late 1970s.
   But the brewery didn't go high-profile until 1985, when its first
advertisement for responsible drinking aired. Role models such as
sports stars Steve Garvey and Patrick Ewing were hired to tell the
public to ``Know When to Say When,'' a program that provides
guidelines for bartenders, waiters and waitresses.
   ``They weren't beer commercials by any means,'' Lambright said.
``Prior to that, most of what you saw were third-party efforts in
the public-service announcement mode as opposed to a company
actually paying for regular price commercial time to run a non-beer
commercial responsibility piece.''
   Collectively, Anheuser-Busch's strategy for fighting alcohol
abuse is ``Operation ALERT,'' an acronym for Action and Leadership
through Education, Responsibility and Training. The array of
programs designed as aids for the estimated 80 million beer drinkers
in the United States runs the gamut.
   There's T.I.P.S., which stands for Training for Intervention
Procedures by Servers of Alcohol, an instruction manual to teach
retailers how to recognize and avoid troublesome situations
involving alcohol. And Good Sport, a campaign aimed at combatting
rowdyism in stadiums and arenas.
   The Buddy System is designed for use with college-age audiences.
It recommends holding parties with a dry last hour, and establishing
a network of friends to serve as designated drivers.
   Alert Cab, a program in 140 cities, provides a free taxicab ride
home for customers in bars and restaurants who are faced with
possible drunk driving situations. I'm Driving is another
designated-driver program.
   Anheuser-Busch also is a major sponsor of SADD, Students Against
Drunk Driving, and has published pamphlets dealing with the effects
of alcohol consumption on motorcycle and boating safety.

<HEAD>National Semiconductor Loses $81 Million In Third Quarter From Cont.
Ops.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Semiconductor Corp., which
has shed one division, agreed to sell another and laid off 2,000
workers to stem losses, announced Thursday it lost $81 million from
continuing operations in its most recent quarter.
   Charles E. Sporck, president and chief executive officer, said
the company's chip business was hurt by a decline in bookings in
late 1988 caused by a buildup of customers' inventory, a slowdown in
computer sales and seasonal factors.
   He said he expects improvement in the current quarter following a
restructuring of the chip division, cutbacks in the worldwide
workforce and reduced spending.
   The chipmaker's losses for the first nine months of its fiscal
year through February 26 reached $116.8 million from continuing
operations, compared with a $34.6 million gain during the same
period a year earlier. In the third quarter last year, the company
had a gain of $13.4 million from continuing operations.
   Net losses of $44.6 million in the quarter and $100.3 million in
the nine-month period were cushioned by a $45.1 million gain from
the sale of National's Datachecker Systems Inc. That division,
though, lost $8.8 million in the quarter and $28.6 million in the
first three quarters.
   Net sales were $589 million for the quarter, up from $572 million
a year earlier. For the first nine months this year, sales were $1.8
billion, up from $1.6 billion a year earlier.
   ``The size of the loss doesn't shock me, but it was larger than I
anticipated,'' said Jim Hammons, a computer industry analyst with
the Sierra Group in Tempe, Ariz. ``I don't know that it's going to
hurt them any more on Wall Street. Nobody expected them to do very
well this quarter.''
   National Semiconductor's chances of recovering much in the fourth
quarter are slim, Hammons said, and would depend on how well they
market products and use the cash from their recent sales of
divisions.
   ``They have some new products coming out that could help them,
but I don't think they'll be ready to help in this quarter,'' he
said.
   On Feb. 27, National Semiconductor announced it had agreed to
sell its National Advanced Systems for $398 million to Hitachi Ltd.
of Japan and Electronic Data Systems, a unit of General Motors Corp.
National Semiconductor expects to close the sale during the current
quarter.
   National Advanced Systems is Hitachi's largest distributor of
mainframe computers that run the same programs as International
Business Machines Corp.'s big mainframes. It has 2,200 employees
worldwide, including 1,200 in the United States.
   After that sale, National Semiconductor would be pared down to
about 35,000 worldwide. The company announced 2,000 layoffs earlier
this year.

   The stock market extended its recent rally today,
propelled by new evidence of a slackening in economic growth.
   The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production was
unchanged in February from the month before.
   A separate government report showed a decline of 0.2 percentage
points, to 84.3 percent, in capacity utilization of the nation's
production facilities.
   Analysts said those figures were read by some traders as evidence
of an easing in the strains the economy has been exerting on
inflation and interest rates.
   However, brokers also noted a persistent mood of caution about
Friday's impending report on the producer price index for February.
A 1 percent increase in the index during January unsettled both the
stock and bond markets.
   A further complication for the immediate market outlook was the
``triple witching hour'' due on Friday, when the last trading occurs
in a series of stock-index options and futures.
   There was talk on the Street that this quarterly phenomenon could
produce more volatility than recent similar occasions, since the
pace of computer program trading by professionals using these
contracts appears to have revived lately.

   The dollar finished mixed in domestic dealings
Thursday after rising in Europe despite central bank intervention.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York said
gold was bid at $388.75 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from
Wednesday's late bid of $391.10.
   Traders agreed much of the activity centered around the Japanese
yen. Before easing, the dollar had reached a high in U.S. trading of
about 131.30 yen, a level not seen since last October. But traders
said the move reflected more weakness in the yen than strength in
the dollar.
   ``It was sort of a new level, but what happened was that there
was selling of the yen, more so than a buying of dollars,'' said
Frank Watson, a vice president at the New York branch of Swiss Bank
Corp.
   The dollar put in a more positive performance earlier in Europe,
where the currency closed higher across the boards despite
intervention to temper its rise.
   Dealers said the European central banks stepped in and had some
success in forcing the dollar lower for awhile, but without added
intervention by the Federal Reserve, the currency gained on the day.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 130.73 Japanese yen, from
129.88 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded higher at 130.85. In
New York, the dollar rose to 130.86 yen, from 130.60 yen on
Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7210 late Thursday, cheaper
for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.7235. In New York, one pound
cost $1.7189, cheaper than $1.7200 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8689 West German marks, down from
1.8723; 1.6083 Swiss francs, up from 1.6080; 6.3275 French francs,
down from 6.3355; 1,371.75 Italian lire, down from 1,373.50, and
1.1953 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1964.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's late
rates, included: 1.8710 West German marks, up from 1.8670; 1.6075
Swiss francs, up from 1.6038; 6.3235 French francs, up from 6.3200;
2.1085 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1065; 1,371.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,369.37, and 1.1965 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1935.
   Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery closed at $389.80 a troy ounce, down
from $392.10 on Wednesday.
   The decline overseas was more pronounced. In London, gold traded
at a late bid of $388.25 a troy ounce, down from $392.25. The late
bid price in Zurich was $388.60 an ounce, down from $393.25. Earlier
in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $391.70, down from $395.37.
   Silver prices also weakened. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $6.059 a troy ounce, down from
$6.091 Wednesday. In London, the metal traded at a late bid of $6.04
a troy ounce, down from $6.12.

<HEAD>Eastern's Rivals Raising Fares on Competitive Routes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some rivals of strike-torn Eastern Airlines have
raised fares on competitive routes since the 13-day-old walkout
began, moves they say stem from higher demand but that one consumer
group complains is price gouging.
   Some competitors said Thursday that their recent fare hikes were
unrelated to the Eastern strike, which has grounded most of the
airline's flights.
   The walkout by Machinists has been supported by most of the
pilots and flight attendants at Eastern, which sought bankruptcy
protection from its creditors about a week ago.
   All the airlines are heading into the peak spring travel period
combining Spring Break and the Easter and Passover holidays.
   Eastern archrival Delta Air Lines says it hasn't raised fares but
has tightened fare restrictions as a result of the Eastern debacle.
   On flights from cities in the Northeast to Florida, where it
competes with Eastern, Delta has boosted its cancellation penalty on
discount fares to 100 percent from 25 percent. Delta took the action
because the Eastern strike had led many passengers to book on
multiple carriers including Delta _ creating ``no shows'' for those
airlines, said Delta spokeswoman Jackie Pate.
   In addition, she said, Delta has reduced the number of cut-rate
fares available on certain flights ``to protect business
travelers.'' The spillover from the Eastern walkout meant that
discount-fare passengers were displacing full-fare business fliers
on Delta flights, Ms. Pate said.
   Other Eastern competitors _ notably Trans World Airlines Inc. and
USAir Group Inc. _ confirmed they recently raised fares on some
routes they share with Eastern.
   Those moves were called ``opportunistic'' and ``gouging'' by Dan
Smith, consumer affairs director of the International Airline
Passengers Association in Dallas.
   Smith said he was skeptical about the insistence by TWA and USAir
that their fare boosts were unrelated to the strike and were not an
attempt to capitalize on Eastern's woes.
   ``You would hope they would be more sensitive during these
unusual circumstances,'' Smith said.
   The possible disappearance of Eastern from the skies likely would
reduce the number of discounted fares available to passengers, he
said.
   Spokesmen for United Airlines, American Airlines and Pan Am
Corp., which also compete with Eastern on some routes, said those
carriers had not raised fares since the Eastern walkout started
March 4.
   TWA plans to increase its discount fares between New York and San
Juan, Puerto Rico, starting March 23 in order to bring them closer
to TWA's Florida fares, which are sharply higher, said TWA spokesman
Bob Blattner in St. Louis, Mo.
   He called the timing of the move a ``coincidence.''
   The round-trip discount fares between New York and San Juan will
be raised from $239-$259 to $259-$289. TWA's discount New York-Miami
fares, which haven't been increased, range from $258 to $298.
   USAir spokesman David Shipley said that carrier ``has not raised
any fares as a result of the Eastern strike.''
   Rather, he said, USAir's recent increases were an extension of a
move begun last November. The latest hikes include a rise in the
regular one-way fare between Boston and Tampa, Fla., to $329 from
$319, also effective March 23.
   The Boston-Tampa route competes directly with Eastern. Shipley
declined to give examples of other new fare increases applied to
non-competing routes.
   ``These people are businessmen and they've seen an opportunity to
raise fares,'' said Andrew Geller, an airline analyst at Provident
National Bank in Philadelphia.
   Some members of Congress and others have argued that a demise of
Eastern could seriously reduce competition in the nation's airline
industry, whose ranks have been thinned by deregulation. They have
warned the reduced competition could lead to higher fares, defeating
the intended main purpose of deregulation _ to make it affordable
for more Americans to fly.

   Crude oil futures rose slightly in active trading
Thursday after rallying sharply a day earlier.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 7 cents
to close at $19.84 a barrel.
   On Wednesday the contract soared to the highest level in nearly
17 months, closing at $19.77. The last time the near-month contract
was higher was on Oct. 30, 1987, when the near-term contract settled
at $19.96 a barrel.
   Among refined oil products traded on the exchange, the April
contract for unleaded gasoline edged up 0.03 cent to finish at 55.83
cents a gallon. The heating oil contract for delivery in April
declined 0.36 cent to 53.83 cents.
   Analysts said the market was in a retrenchment phase after
Wednesday's gains.
   ``The market was stuck today. It consolidated after yesterday's
sharp gains,'' said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said trading volume was ``good.''

<HEAD>Panasonic Consumers to Get Refunds in Price-Fixing Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panasonic Co. will issue refunds to about
687,000 consumers across the country as part of a $16 million
price-fixing settlement agreed to this week, New York Attorney
General Robert Abrams said Wednesday.
   The refunds range from $17 to $45 for products such as
videocassette recorders, cordless telephones, answering machines and
stereo equipment marketed under the Panasonic or Technics brand
name, Abrams said.
   The company last year pressured retailers to charge a certain
price for some of its most popular products, threatening to cut off
their supply if they didn't comply, he said.
   The settlement worked out by Abrams' office and Panasonic's
parent company, Matsushita Electric Corporation of America, was
announced in January but was formally accepted Tuesday by officials
in 48 other states and the District of Columbia, he said. Hawaii,
which deals with a separate Panasonic subsidiary, is not covered by
the agreement.
   Consumers who purchased products between March 1 and August 31,
1988, will be eligible for the refunds, Abrams said.
   Panasonic agreed not to engage in the alleged activities for five
years but did not admit to any wrongdoing.

   The stock market climbed to a six-week high
Thursday, propelled by new evidence of a slackening in economic
growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 20.17 to
2,340.71, its highest close since it stood at 2,343.21 on Feb. 8.
The day before that the average hit a post-crash high of 2,347.14.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
939 up, 523 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 196.04 million
shares, up from 167.07 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those

totaled 237.09 million shares.

<HEAD>FCC Ends Old Rules, Says Consumers Should Save Under New System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday abolished two-decades-old price regulations on American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s long-distance services, saying consumers
should reap $900 million in savings under a new pricing plan over
the next four years.
   One consumer group, however, said the plan could lead to the
first increases in long-distance rates, particularly on nights and
weekends, since the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T.
   The 3-0 commission decision, which FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick
called a milestone in federal telephone regulation, will replace
AT&amp;T's so-called rate-of-return rules on July 1 with a plan that
would tie long-distance prices to productivity gains and the rate of
inflation.
   The vote, postponed in January under pressure from Congress,
followed more than two years of rancorous debate between Patrick and
critics on Capitol Hill and consumer groups who said the new plan
may slow the 4-year-old decline in long-distance rates.
   But Patrick said it was time to change the 1960s-era system under
which AT&amp;T was allowed to make a set profit beyond its costs.
Patrick said that system gave AT&amp;T incentive to pad expenses.
   ``We simply can no longer have a regulatory approach that was
crafted in the 1960s and to use that system in the 1990s and beyond.
It is simply outdated,'' he said.
   AT&amp;T said the decision was ``a step forward for AT&amp;T and good
news for our customers.''
   Patrick made a number of revisions to the plan to assuage
congressional concerns, including additional safeguards for
residential and small-business users.
   One of Patrick's critics was Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.
   Markey said the plan ``still does not contain sufficient consumer
safeguards to ensure that residential telephone customers will
fairly share in rate reductions which should result from new
telephone technologies. I fear that the days of real long-distance
price reductions for the average residential caller may be over.''
   Markey said he will co-sponsor legislation requiring the FCC to
provide price and cost data with which Congress can measure the
effect of price caps on consumers and AT&amp;T's competitors.
   Currently, AT&amp;T can earn about 12 percent on its investment.
Under the new plan, overall rates must rise 3 percentage points less
than the rate of inflation _ for example, a 1 percent increase if
the rate of inflation were 4 percent.
   Rates would be set on three broad categories of AT&amp;T service:
residential and small business; 800 services; and all other business
services.
   To make sure big business does not get all the benefit of rate
cuts, rates for residential and small-business prices must rise at
least 2 percentage points less than the rate of inflation, the FCC
said.
   Within the residential-small business category, prices of
particular services such as night and weekend calling could increase
no more than 4 percentage points above the overall percentage change
in rates. For example, if inflation was 4 percent and overall rates
rose 1 percent, night and weekend calls could rise 5 percent.
   Gene Kimmelman, executive director of the Consumer Federation of
America, said AT&amp;T has lowered long-distance rates faster under
rate-of-return regulation and that the new plan is ``hardly an
improvement for the public'' since long-distance rates conceivably
could go up in some categories.
   ``It will possibly give you the first real long-distance
increases since the breakup of AT&amp;T,'' Kimmelman said.
   The plan also limits how much AT&amp;T can lower its rates, which
commissioners James Quello and Patricia Diaz Dennis said caused them
concern. But Dennis said she supported ``this grand experiment'' of
price-cap regulation.
   Quello said he reluctantly supported the limits, or floors, on
how much prices can go down and that he hoped such restraints could
be removed quickly. But he said the plan overall was a
``precedent-setting issue that is really going to benefit the
public.''
   AT&amp;T said it was ``mystified that the commission finds it
necessary to continue treating AT&amp;T differently by limiting our
ability to reduce prices in such an extremely competitive market.''
   Patrick said local telephone companies will be placed under some
kind of rate cap plan on July 1, 1990. The commission ordered local
companies to submit pricing plans in that regard by May 17.
   Although state utilities commissions regulate phone companies'
local rates, the FCC regulates how much the companies charge
long-distance carriers to plug into their local networks. Those
access charges account for a big part of long-distance costs.
   BellSouth, one of the seven regional companies created in the
1984 breakup of AT&amp;T, said the commission ``took an important step
to benefit consumers in a substantial way'' but that savings would
have been greater had the commission applied the new rules to local
companies this year.
   MCI Communications Corp., one of AT&amp;T's chief competitors in the
long-distance market, said it supported the price cap plan for
long-distance carriers but said local phone companies should still
be strictly regulated because they have monopolies on local service.
   But United States Telephone Association President John Sodolski
said: ``For the full benefit of price caps to be realized, local
exchange carriers must be free to employ it as well.''
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., introduced legislation earlier this
month to prevent implementation of price caps until Congress can
study the proposal more thoroughly.
   Cooper said he wanted explicit assurances in the plan that
universal telephone service and subsidies for high-cost telephone
service in remote areas would be maintained and that long-distance
rates would not rise disproportionately in those remote areas.

<HEAD>Fruit Fallout: Poisoning Menaces $900 Million Import Business</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Chile-Fruit Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The poisoning of grapes from Chile poses a
high-profile threat to a business that has grown to $900 million a
year by using Southern Hemisphere farmers to put fruit on American
tables all winter.
   American importers and Chilean farmers worry that if the cyanide
sabotage case isn't solved soon, they could lose the market for the
25 percent of their crop still on trees or aboard U.S.-bound ships.
   The tampering, which prompted the Food and Drug Administration to
recommend pulling grapes, nectarines, pears and other Chilean winter
fruit from market shelves, also might give the business a permanent
public relations black eye, one big importer said.
   ``I think it's a major, major, overreaction...an entire industry
is being destroyed,'' Los Angeles importer Rick Eastes said Tuesday.
   Eastes, manager for the David Oppenheimer-California import firm
munched a couple of red flame seedless grapes from Chile for
reporters Tuesday to underscore his anger over the FDA's no-sell
recommendation.
   The FDA advised grocers to pull Chilean fruit from the shelves
Tuesday after tests in Philadelphia found cyanide _ at far below
harmful levels _ had apparently been put in two clusters of grapes.
   Virtually all the so-called summer fruit on American grocery
shelves this time of year is from Chile, whose farmers have learned
to exploit the Southern Hemisphere growing season that is a mirror
image of that in the north.
   From a trickle of grape imports in the 1950's, the business has
grown to projected shipments this year with a retail value of $900
million, said Caryl Saunders, a San Francisco spokeswoman for the
industry.
   In 1979, when imports were starting to gain momentum, the retail
value of Chilean grapes and stone fruit was $72 million, said Ms.
Saunders. By 1988, that had climbed to $600 million.
   More than 100 ships full of Chilean fruit are expected to land
this year, to be distributed nationwide from the ports of
Philadelphia; Long Beach, Calif., and Tampa and Cape Canaveral in
Florida.
   The business is organized by the growers, under the banner of the
Chilean Winter Fruit Association, and the importers, called the
American Produce Association.
   That loose alliance carefully orchestrates the traffic to avoid
ruffling the feathers of American farmers.:
   Grapes, which make up three-quarters of the shipments, are
carefully withheld until the last California emperor grapes clear
the supermarkets, usually sometime in December. Grape shipments are
cut off _ earlier than would be decreed by nature _ in late April
when the first California grapes make their way to market.
   There is little overlap in growing season for nectarines and
other fruit, so there is less potential for conflict with American
growers, Ms. Saunders said.
   Importers and growers are anxious for the FDA to declare the
fruit safe, because products already on U.S. shores is will
deteriorate beyond salvation in a week or two, Ms. Saunders said.
Additionally, an estimated 25 percent of the crop remains on the
trees and vines of Chile's farms, or on ships headed north.
   Importer Eastes called the FDA's advice to quit selling Chilean
fruit unnecessary and maintained that testing here and new security
measures imposed at packing houses in Chile adequately protect
American consumers. He suggested the agency was trying to burnish an
image tarnished in the public mind by the current furor over Alar, a
possibly carcinogenic chemical sprayed on a fraction of the U.S.
apple crop.
   Fruits imported from Chile include grapes, nectarines, peaches,
plums, apricots, pears, Granny Smith apples, cherries, raspberries,
blueberries, cantaloupe and honeydew melons.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Trade Association's Convention in Hawaii is Canceled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A savings and loan trade association on
Wednesday canceled its annual convention in Hawaii this year, thus
avoiding television images of S&amp;L executives lolling on palm-fringed
beaches at a time when the industry is asking for the biggest
taxpayer bailout in U.S. history.
   ``It would not be appropriate for us to hold a convention in
Hawaii at a time when Congress and the administration are working to
find a solution to this terrible crisis facing taxpayers,'' Bud
Koch, chairman of the National Council of Savings Institutions, said
in a statement.
   The council, the smaller of two main trade groups representing
S&amp;Ls, is taking a lesson from its larger rival, the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions.
   The league held its convention in November at a luxury hotel on
Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. It said it went ahead with the meeting
because it had been planned years in advance and would have been
costly to cancel at the last minute. Nevertheless, the group endured
criticism after television news reports showed executives on the
beach and attending a lavish luau.
   The council said would it would suffer ``substantial financial
costs'' by canceling its meeting, which had been scheduled for May
on the island of Kauai, but Koch said, ``Thrifts who are members of
the national council ... have concluded that it would be wrong to
conduct business as usual.''
   President Bush's plan for bailing out the savings and loan
deposit insurance fund would spend about $150 billion over the next
10 years. Most analysts say at least half of that would come from
taxpayers. That exceeds the combined costs of the Marshall Plan aid
to Europe after World War II and the bailouts of the Chrysler Corp.,
New York City and Lockheed Corp.
   Koch said the council may schedule a special meeting in
Washington in May to elect officers and take care of other business
normally conducted at the annual convention.
   In another development, one of three members of the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board, the agency regulating S&amp;Ls, announced his
resignation effective Aug. 18. Lawrence White, appointed to the
board on Nov. 12, 1986, is returning to teach at New York
University's school of business.
   Under the president's proposed S&amp;L plan, the bank board would be
reduced to a single chairman, who would report to the treasury
secretary.

<TEXT>
   Systems Associates Inc., a unit of American
Express Co.'s Data Based Services Group, will acquire McDonnell
Douglas Health Systems Co., the companies said Thursday.
   Jeremy Causley, president of McDonnell Douglas Information
Systems Co., said the decision to sell the unit was one of many
recent moves to focus the direction and strengthen the competitive
position of the aerospace and technology giant.
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.
   ``Although the U.S. health information systems market is strong
and vital,'' Causley said, ``pursuing this business no longer fits
our overall strategic direction.''
   Causley said, however, that McDonnell Douglas Information Systems
will continue to sell, support and service health software packages
in international health markets. He said these existing systems run
on McDonnell Douglas software.
   Systems Associates said the acquisition will more than triple its
client base to more than 1,000 health care institutions in the
United States nad Puerto Rico. The company is a leading provider of
information services and administrative systems for hospitals and
private physicians' practices.

   The U.S. industrial operating rate eased last
month for the first time since September, the government said
Thursday in a report welcomed by those worried that strains on the
economy are pushing up prices.
   U.S. factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.3 percent of
capacity in February, down 0.2 percentage point from January, when
the 84.5 percent rate was the highest in nearly a decade, the
Federal Reserve Board reported.
   At the same time, the pace of industrial production held steady
in February after 12 months of steady advances, the central bank
said in a second report Thursday.
   Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson told reporters the
figures are ``consistent with the notion of some moderation in the
economy'' although it would be premature to say they signal a trend.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
rose 20.17 points. Traders took the reports as evidence that
inflationary pressures in the economy were easing but analysts were
cautious about reading too much into one month's figures.
   ``The markets can take some comfort that the edge is coming off
the burst of momentum through the end of the year in the economy,''
said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.
   But he continued, ``There is no suggestion ... that the softness
spells recession or even major slowdown at this time, nor that it
will flow through and arrest the upward momentum of inflation.''
   The closer factories get to full capacity, the greater the fear
they will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand,
leading to shortages and price increases.
   Just Wednesday, the Federal Reserve reported that while expansion
and improved efficiency ``are forestalling widespread bottlenecks,
materials and product prices are edging up, albeit sporadically and
at an uneven pace.''
   Concern about inflation heightened last month after the Labor
Department reported that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in January
while wholesale prices shot up 1 percent. That prompted the Fed to
intensify its year-long campaign to push up interest rates in an
effort to slow economic growth and thus restrain inflation.
   Economist James Annable of the First National Bank of Chicago
said that while the Fed can ``breath a sigh of relief'' at
February's industrial production and capacity use reports, there are
other, more convincing indications that the economy continues to
expand at a moderately strong pace.
   ``What we've got in this economy is continued movement forward,''
Annable said. ``The news for financial markets is good but in fact
it certainly doesn't mean that the Federal Reserve is going to ease
off.''
   Last month's operating rate of 84.3 percent was up from 82.4
percent a year earlier. At manufacturing plants, the operating rate
dipped 0.2 percentage point to 84.6 percent.
   Use of capacity for production of durable goods, ``big ticket''
items expected to last three or more years, stood at 83.4 percent,
down from 83.5 percent in January. The rate for non-durable goods
was 86.3 percent in February, down from 86.7 percent in January.
   The rate at motor vehicle and parts plants was down 1.2
percentage points to 84.9 percent last month. It was the second
straight monthly decrease after steady advances from August to
December.
   The auto industry has been plagued by slow sales so far this
year, as higher interest rates and declining demand set in.
   The operating rate at utilities rebounded to 82.9 percent in
February, up 1.4 percentage point from January when activity was
depressed by relatively warm weather.
   In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the
operating rate also fell 1.4 percentage point to 81.1 percent in
February, as coal production continued to fall from its high level
at the end of last year.
   Production, meanwhile, held steady in the manufacturing sector in
February after a 0.7 percent gain in January.
   Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.2 million units
last month, down from the 7.5 million pace of January.
   Output at mines and oil wells dropped 1.8 percent in February
after falling 1.9 percent in January. Production at utilities rose
1.9 percent, after dropping 0.5 percent during the unusually mild
temperatures of January.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended March 6, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,084.2 billion from a revised $3,076.5 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$3,950.7 billion from a revised $3,941.7 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $791.5 billion from a revised $788.8 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3
percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since early
1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,069.4 billion, a 3.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M3 averaged $3,927.3 billion, up 4.4 percent, while M1 rose
1.2 percent to an average of $788.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $459 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$793 million a day the week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $362 million
in the two weeks ended March 8, down from a revised $656 million in
the two weeks ended Feb. 22.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $287.7 billion in the two-week period ended March 8, up from
$287.4 billion two weeks earlier.

   Long-struggling Maxicare Health Plans Inc.
filed a federal bankruptcy petition Thursday but promised to keep
serving the 1 million Americans covered by its plans in a dozen
states.
   The company, which operates health maintenance organizations
under the names Maxicare, HealthCare USA and HealthAmerica,
announced it sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Maxicare promised to keep serving patients, and to continue
paying doctors and hospitals. The filing, made in U.S. District
Court in Santa Ana, gives the company a reprieve from creditors and
allows it to continue operating under court supervision while
seeking to reorganize.
   Included in the filing are the Los Angeles-based parent company
and operations in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana,
Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas
and Washington.
   Excluded is the company's Wisconsin HMO.
   Maxicare, once the nation's biggest private HMO, has been losing
money for two years, and in recent months has cut membership from
2.3 million to 1 million by selling several health plans in 14
states. In announcing the bankruptcy, Peter Ratican, chairman and
chief executive officer, revealed the company was negotiating sale
of its California plan, previously said to be part of the solid
``core'' the company intended to retain.
   Ratican said in a news release the company filed for bankruptcy
because it couldn't pay its bills.
   ``These actions enable us to protect our operations while gaining
the time to finalize and implement a plan for reorganization,''
Ratican said. ``We acted in the face of increasing demands by
creditors and our inability at this time to obtain additional
financing.''
   Maxicare's stock, which sold for as much as $28 a share in the
company's boom years a decade ago, closed at 18.75 cents a share
Thursday, down 50 cents from Wednesday's close.
   Maxicare, saddled with debt, hit along with the rest of the HMO
business with soaring medical costs, and struggling to overcome the
effects of an ambitious expansion drive, has logged losses in eight
straight quarters.
   In the first nine months of 1988, the company lost $250.5
million. Final 1988 results haven't been reported.
   Debt as of December included $150 million in bank loans and $295
million in bonds.
   Maxicare's health plans are structured in the form of health
maintenance organizations, under which customers, generally enrolled
through their employers, are entitled to visit designated doctors,
generally for a small fee.
   Doctors are paid on a set monthly budget rather than being
reimbursed for specific services. The intent is to cut the overall
cost of medical care by encouraging people to get regular checkups
and preventive treatment, rather than waiting to seek treatment
until a medical crisis strikes.
   Maxicare doesn't own hospitals or clinics, as do some HMOs, so
its assets consist primarily of a management team and ``good will,''
or its image with customers.
   Founded in 1973 by the husband-and-wife team of Chairman Fred
Wasserman and President Pamela Anderson, Maxicare grew quickly,
capitalizing on the industry's belief that HMOs were the wave of the
future. Easily raising money through stock sale and loans, the
company grew into a national health plan.
   By the mid-1980s, HMOs were under pressure from rising medical
costs. But Maxicare bit off a big chunk of new business in 1986 by
buying two ailing competitors, HealthCare USA and HealthAmerica.
   The strain of trying to digest the acquisitions was compounded by
management's inability to keep costs and the number of doctor visits
down, said analyst Steven Reid, who follows the company for the L.H.
Friend &amp; Co. Inc. investment firm in Los Angeles.
   Founder Wasserman and Ms. Anderson were ousted in August 1988 and
replaced with Ratican, an outside director with a background in the
entertainment business, most recently as president of ailing De
Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc., which now is in Chapter 11.
   But he has so far been unable to reverse the slide.
   Reid said Ratican, by reassuring investors the firm could work
its way out of the hole, has done plan members a disservice.
   ``You've got a situation where a layman has an opportunity to
switch plans ... and he reads in the paper `This company's in good
shape,' he continues his enrollment,'' Reid said.
   The bankruptcy filing comes at a critical time for the company's
hopes at resurrection because workers generally are given the
opportunity to switch medical plans each June, Reid noted. Competing
medical plans already have started marketing themselves among
employees, and the filing is likely to both distract Maxicare's
management from that marketing effort.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Soar on Chinese Buy-Swap Rumor, Technical Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Sugar futures prices surged to their highest levels in nine
months Thursday amid rumors that China had come into possession of
as much as 500,000 tons of sugar.
   ``What you saw was a market catching fire,'' said Arthur
Stevenson, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York.
``And the real excitement is the possible growing participation in
the markets of China _ the world's most populous nation.''
   On other markets, energy futures were mixed to marginally higher
after three straight sessions of strong rallies; gold and silver
futures dipped, but platinum rose; and livestock and pork futures
edged lower.
   Sugar settled 10 cents to 51 cents higher on the New York Coffee,
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in May at
12.59 cents a pound.
   Buying began with a rumor that the Chinese had bought between
150,000 and 500,000 tons of raw sugar from Thailand, though many
traders cast doubts that the shipment exceeded 350,000 tons.
   Many others traders said they believed the Chinese actually
bought the sugar last fall from Cuba and, learning the Soviets had
made a similar-sized purchase from Thailand, simply swapped
shipments to take advantage of economies in delivery of the sugar.
   Also fueling the market was talk the Brazilians had sold 100,000
tons and that Argentina was in the market for a large shipment.
   The climbing prices triggered a string of technical buy-stops _
decisions made by price-chart considerations _ and the market broke
a ``quadruple top'' at 12.38 cents and continued rising.
   Energy futures, which hit a 16-month high Monday and soared again
in successive sessions, were mixed. Crude oil highlighted the
complex, losing 5 cents at the opening on profit-taking, and
recovering gradually in light trading.
   Crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 9 cents higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with April at $19.84 a barrel; heating oil was
.02 cent to .36 cent lower, with April at 53.83 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was .50 cent lower to .12 cent higher, with April
at 55.83 cents a gallon.
   Reports of cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as
problems with production facilities in Norway and Qatar had fueled
previous rallies.
   Gold and silver continued sliding in the face of a firm dollar
and uncertainty about whether higher inflation is in the offing.
   Platinum got a boost from apparent trade-house buying prompted
either by ideas the market was oversold or by recent sales by the
Japanese.
   Gold settled $2.30 to $2.90 lower at the New York Commodity
Exchange, with March at $389.80 a troy ounce; silver slipped 3.2
cents to 4.7 cents, with March at $6.059 a troy ounce. Platinum was
$7.20 to $7.70 higher, with April at $545.50 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures mostly were lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Volume was light as traders, many expecting a
bearish tone, remained on the sideline in advance of the USDA's
cattle-on-feedlot report issued after the close.
   Live cattle were .37 cent lower to .02 cent higher, with April at
77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17 cent to .35 cent higher,
with March at 80.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .50 cent lower to
.10 cent higher, with April at 43.17 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to 1 cent lower; with March at 37.15 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed in light, quiet
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher, with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.37 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to }
cents higher, with March at $2.78 a bushel; oats were \ to 1} cents
higher, with March at $2.08{ a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent

<HEAD>Chilean Officials Call for Swift End To Fruit Ban</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS new 2nd graf with meetings today; INSERTS 5 grafs after
6th pvs, `The FDA' to add detail on talks with industry on level of inspections
being proposed</HEAD>

   A high-level Chilean delegation called Thursday
for ``swift action'' to avoid further economic and social turmoil in
Chile resulting from the suspension on U.S. sales of Chilean fruit
over an apparent cyanide poisoning attempt.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials were meeting with representatives of
the Chilean government and its fruit growers, trying to find a way
to release for sale the tons of Chilean fruit detained at American
docks without compromising public safety.
   The Chilean call was disclosed in a joint communique issued after
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with the Chilean foreign
affairs and agriculture ministers.
   As Chilean fruit continued to pile up at airports and docks and
the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Chileans were
threatened, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said a small team
of FDA inspectors will be sent to Chile on Saturday to check
security on Chilean fruit.
   The State Department meeting came four days after the FDA warned
Americans to avoid Chilean fruit because traces of cynadide were
found in Chilean fruit shipped to Philadelphia.
   There was no sign of an imminent end to the crisis despite the
high-level attention it was receiving.
   The FDA said technical meetings were continuing to determine what
levels of inspections might be feasible for fruit at American docks.
   A government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
there had been discussion of inspections of 8 percent to 10 percent
of the fruit on the docks now and in the future, and release the
produce if no contamination is found. However, ``it doesn't appear
to be feasible to do that high a level now.''
   For the future, Chilean officials are proposing to inspect
visually about 4 percent to 5 percent of their fruit before it is
shipped for export, the source said.
   ``We're getting reasonably close on that (Chile's) end of things
on something that might be acceptable, but the problem of what to do
with what's on the ships and in warehouses is still up in the air,''
the source said.
   The fruit that's been removed from store shelves ``is such a
different problem they may just end up with no solution to that
except to dump it,'' the source said.
   The Washington Post reported that the Chilean Exporters
Association estimates about $20 million worth of fruit is detained,
under refrigeration, at docks and airports in the United States,
about $4 million worth is to arrive in the next few days by ship,
and $15 million worth is ready to be shipped from Chile.
   Inspectors at ports in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami have
examined 6,859 cases of grapes and nearly nearly 4,000 cases of
other fruits: honeydew melons, nectarines, apples, raspberries,
pears, cantalopes, plums, peaches, seedless watermelon, Juan Canary
Melons and blackberries.
   The joint communique issued at the State Department stressed the
determination of both sides to reach a solution.
   Chilean Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz told reporters
after the meeting that he is confident a solution will be found and
described the encounter as ``very constructive.''
   Baker, responding to Chilean anger over a U.S. government warning
that citizens not eat Chilean fruit, said the action was taken
strictly as a health and safety measure.
   ``We think the foreign minister understands that,'' he said.
   In Miami, Robert Aders, the president of the Food Marketing
Institute, said the entire food industry will be hurt by the
discovery of cyanide in Chilean produce and cancer-causing chemicals
in apples.
   ``The loss will probably be felt throughout the system,'' he said.
   Chilean produce continues to arrive in the United States, and
Aders noted one shipment reached Miami Wednesday night.
   ``The indication is they're not going to let it be sold,'' he
said.
   Aders predicted surveillance of imported fruit will increase,
saying, ``I expect that there'll be a lot more activity at the dock,
including vigilance at the point of shipment.''
   But security will continue to be a problem. ``The whole food
system is based on the integrity of the people in it,'' he said.
``Suddenly it's an attractive place for criminals to go to express a
grievance.''

   Three former Sundstrand Corp. executives were
charged Thursday with conspiring to defraud the federal government,
five months after the defense contractor agreed to plead guilty to
fraud and pay a $115 million fine.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said the indictments ``demonstrate
that the federal government will not waver from employing the
resources necessary to protect the integrity of the defense
procurement process.''
   The indictments are part of an ongoing three-year investigation
of the Rockford-based defense contractor.
   Sundstrand pleaded guilty in October to fraud charges in a
four-count criminal information. The $115 million fine was the
largest fraud settlement in Defense Department history.
   The aerospace manufacturer allegedly overbilled the government
for aircraft parts; underbid actual costs on other contracts and
attempted to recover through overhead accounts set up for other
purposes; and submitted claims for such things as babysitting
expenses and country club memberships.
   Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam said the company was not
involved in Thursday's indictments. He declined further comment.
   The three men were identified as Joseph McCarthy, 53, of
Rockford, a former division controller; Ray John Chapel Jr., 46, of
Reston, Va., a former division pricing manager; and Ralph Hamann,
63, of Rockford, a former pricing group supervisor.
   They were charged with one count each of conspiring to defraud
and scheming to conceal. McCarthy was charged with two counts of
making false statements, and Chapel and Hamann with four counts of
the same offense.
   McCarthy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $1
million in fines; Chapel and Hamann face 30-year terms and $1.5
million in fines if convicted.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Clabault did not say what role
the three allegedly played in the fraud scheme involving Sundstrand.
He declined to say whether the men acted on company orders or have
agreed to cooperate.
   After the settlement was approved last fall, Sundstrand was
suspended from bidding on or receiving government contracts until a
grand jury concluded its probe.
   On Jan. 26, Sundstrand agreed to repay an additional $62.3
million to the Pentagon and make cost-saving concessions on future
contracts one defense official estimated could be worth another $34
million.
