   A state judge on Thursday refused to block
Ted Bundy's fourth date with the electric chair next week.
   The 42-year-old former law student convicted of three murders and
suspected of dozens more is scheduled to die at 7 a.m. Tuesday at
the Florida State Prison. Florida's Supreme Court is scheduled to
hear the case Friday.
   ``It's time. ... We're approaching the 11th anniverary of the
death of Kimberly Leach and Ted Bundy is still alive,'' said state
attorney Jerry Blair, who prosecuted Bundy for the 1978 murder of
the 12-year-old girl, Bundy's last victim.
   Circuit Judge John Peach denied Bundy's claims in an appeal filed
in this city where Bundy abducted the girl.
   ``I think we should have won, but we'll win because his claims
are valid,'' James Coleman, one of Bundy's attorneys.
   Carolyn Snurkowski, with the attorney general's office, agreed
with the judge's ruling. ``I think he (Bundy) has exhausted the
final claims that he wants to raise,'' she said.
   The appeal was based on three issues: Bundy's competence at the
time he rejected a plea bargain that would have kept him from the
electric chair; continuing appeals in a separate case in which Bundy
was convicted of murdering two Florida State University sorority
sisters, and claims that the trial judge received material from the
prosecution that the defense didn't know about.
   Peach heard the arguments after Judge Wallace M. Jopling
disqualified himself at the request of the defense.
   Jopling had presided over Bundy's trial in the Leach case. The
attorneys said Jopling had held conversations with the prosecutors
and reviewed a psychiatric report on Bundy before it was introduced
into evidence.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, who signed the death warrant for Bundy in the
Leach murder, said Wednesday he will not delay the execution even
though a lawyer for Bundy said he could cooperate with investigators
on unsolved cases.
   Bundy, whose case was depicted in the television miniseries ``The
Deliberate Stranger,'' has also been sentenced to death for fatally
bludgeoning the two sorority women in 1978.
   Before his capture in Florida, he was on the FBI's most-wanted
list as a suspect in as many as 36 sex-related murders or
disappearances of young women in the Northwest.
   Bundy has been granted a stay three times before. The last was in
1986, six hours before his scheduled execution.
   A Bundy attorney, Diana Weiner, on Wednesday said Bundy was
committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders. She
didn't specify which cases.
   ``Ted Bundy feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the
right thing in terms of resolving any investigations,'' she said,
adding that his execution would ``effectively cripple law
enforcement agencies around the country.''
   Martinez disagreed but said he would make Bundy available to any
law agency in the next few days. ``I know that he has basically lied
through this entire process and why anyone would believe he would
tell the truth now is beyond me,'' he said.
   The governor signed the death warrant on Tuesday, minutes after
the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear arguments on setting aside
Bundy's death sentence.
   Bundy agreed to an interview with Utah detectives investigating
the deaths or disappearances of five women in 1974 and 1975, when
Bundy was a student at the University of Utah law school, Salt Lake
County deputies reported.
   Bundy and his attorneys agreed to a two-hour conference at noon
Sunday.

   Tulips are popping up in Normandy, hedgehogs are
skipping hibernation in Britain, Muscovites are abandoning their fur
hats and Swiss ski resort operators are complaining.
   Europe is in the midst of a mild spell that not only is throwing
some seasonal clocks out of whack, but could cause serious economic
problems for businesses and farms.
   ``Skiing is impossible, but the ice rink is open and guests can
play cards,'' said a spokesman for the tourist office at San
Bernadino on the southern side of the Swiss Alps.
   ``Hedgehogs are not hibernating _ they are running about the
roads and being knocked down,'' said Sue Stocker, who runs a
wildlife hospital at Aylesbury, north of London. ``We have more than
100 hedgehog patients, more than twice the usual number.''
   Lyman King, who raises ponies in St. Aubin du Thenney west of
Paris, predicted that ``animals are probably going to cycle into
their spring heat and spring functions earlier than normal. That
could spell trouble if we get a late cold. Watch the birds around
your house. They'll be doing things they don't do until March or
April.''
   Indeed, a confused blackbird in Cheltenham, England, set up
housekeeping in a Christmas tree on the balcony of a department
store.
   ``It is raising three chicks, two months before normal nesting
time,'' said assistant store manager Adam Hands.
   In normally glacial Moscow, the temperature this week was 34
degrees, turning the Soviet capital's sidewalks into a slippery
obstacle course of half-melted ice. Many Russians left their shapka
fur hats at home and donned stocking caps, something they don't
usually do until March or April.
   Accompanying the warm spell is a winter drought.
   The French weather service says the drought is the worst since
1976. That means low water tables for next spring and summer.
   In the French Alps, not a snowflake has fallen since Dec. 20. In
the southern Alps, only eight of 40 resorts remain open.
   In central England, the Nottingham Wildlife Trust called out the
fire brigade to fill water holes in Blidworth Woods, where toads
were arriving to spawn two months early. But the ponds and lakes are
dry.
   Lack of snow means fewer skiers. And fewer skiers means fewer
hotel rooms rented, fewer meals consumed in restaurants, and fewer
parkas and gloves purchased.
   Resort operators in the Piedmont region of Italy estimate their
losses at $120 million due to lack of snow and skiers. Officials
there say they will ask for disaster relief.
   The absence of a solid freeze in many areas will mean poorer soil
conditions. Freezing breaks up and aerates the soil.
   Winter wheat and winter barley have started greening in some
countries.
   ``The sap is running in the trees,'' said Normandy farmer Pierre
Gontier. ``And it's been so warm the slugs are coming out and eating
the grain shoots.''
   Bruno Pusterla of the Italian Agriculture Confederation said:
``If it does not snow, and a lot, within this month, we will have no
water to submerge 370,000 acres of rice.''
   High temperatures are going to cost the Dutch government an
estimated $80 million in lost revenues from natural gas used for
heating, said a spokesman for Dutch Gasunie, the country's gas
monopoly.
   All of this is being caused by a high-pressure system that has
remained stationary over Europe, pulling warmer air up from northern
Africa.
   For the Greeks, the warm wave isn't unusual. January always
brings 15 sunny days, known since antiquity as the Alcyonides. The
two-week spell of warm, windless weather was welcomed by the
ancients but is cursed by today's Athenians. The mixture of still
weather and high temperatures now means smog.
   Only normally sunny Portugal seems to have escaped the mild wave.
   Motorists en route to the city of Guarda, which housed King
Sancho I's court in the 11th century, told police of encountering
freezing fog, icy roads and 26 degree temperatures.

<HEAD>Darman Says Bush Firm Against Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush's choice to be budget director shut
the door on the prospect of tax increases to balance the budget a
week after he suggested a number of revenue raisers.
   Richard Darman, nominated by Bush to be director of the Office of
Managment and Budget, insisted during five hours of testimony
Thursday that Bush was not wavering in his ``read-my-lips'' stand
against tax increases.
   Darman, who served as a White House aide and deputy Treasury
secretary during the Reagan administration, was questioned at length
about such things as higher gasoline taxes, boosts in levies on
cigarettes and alcohol, taxing employee-provided fringe benefits and
taxing a larger proportion of Social Security benefits for
high-income beneficiaries.
   In written responses provided to the Senate Governmental Affairs
committee last week, Darman had suggested these various proposals,
which would raise billions of dollars in new revenues, could be
described as ``user fees'' or ``benefit reductions'' rather than
taxes.
   Democrats seized on Darman's written response as the first signal
that the new administration might be receptive to revenue increases.
Many Democrats in Congress believe Bush will eventually be forced to
propose higher taxes to pay for the increases in education, day care
and the environment which he is expected to seek.
   Darman said Thursday, however:
   ``The president meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily be
understood by ordinary Americans. I think the burden of that is the
duck test _ if it looks like a duck, it's a duck.''
   Darman, who repeatedly used the fowl analogy during the hearing,
was presented by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the committee chairman,
with a mock trophy featuring three rubber ducks and the label: ``If
it quacks, its a tax.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he believed Darman had left Bush
with some ``wiggle room'' room on the tax issue despite Darman's
protestations that Bush's feet were set in concrete.
   ``There will not be any new taxes in the Bush budget as defined
by a reasonable observer,'' Darman told reporters during a break in
the hearing.
   However, Darman did carve out some exceptions that he said would
not qualify as a tax, in part because the revenues raised would be
relatively small.
   One of those items, requiring state and local government workers
to pay for Medicare coverage, would bring in an additional $2
billion next year. That idea was in Reagan's final budget and Bush
has supported it in the past, Darman said.
   Darman also indicated that another Reagan budget proposal to
raise $1 billion in new revenues by imposing a variety of user fees
such as a required $25 boat decal and higher charges to veterans
taking out home loans could also show up when Bush submits his own
budget plan.
   Those were among the few hints he revealed about what might be in
Bush's budget plan, which will go to Congress after Bush addresses a
joint session on the deficit issue, a speech expected to take place
Feb. 9.
   The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee had high praise for
Darman's skills as a political strategist and members said they
especially liked Darman's appeal for a greater amount of cooperation
with the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Glenn predicted that Darman's nomination would clear the panel on
Monday and be easily approved by the full Senate later in the week.

<HEAD>Tension, ``Horror Stories'' Fill Inaugural Ticket Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only the three-piece suits, jewels, furs and
high heels suggested that this was anything different from a line of
people appealing traffic tickets or Social Security decisions.
   But the folks who gathered in a convention center holding room
had come from around the country to participate in George Bush's
inauguration as America's 41st president, only to find that their
tickets were missing.
   ``It's been tense,'' said volunteer Elizabeth Barton as she
sifted through a stack of yellow ``special assistance forms'' marked
``resolved.''
   ``No one has actually come across the table and grabbed anyone,
but people have cried and people have shouted. They've stomped on
their coats. They say `But I know some heavy people here.' Or `I'm a
doctor.'''
   There was a multitude of ``horror stories'' in the Error
Resolution Area on Thursday and Tom Keller had one of them.
   A young Republican from Arlington, Va., Keller said his inaugural
ball tickets were delivered to someone else when he wasn't home.
   ``We think it was a maintenance man who was walking out of
another apartment,'' he said. ``He signed for them and took them ...
My date's on hold. I don't know if she's gone out and spent a lot of
money on a dress.''
   Jeanine Heitman of West Palm Beach, Fla., ordered and paid for
two ball tickets, but when she went to pick them up, there was only
one.
   Lynn Remeika of Bladensburg, Md., paid for two ball tickets with
a check her bank said had cleared, but when she went to pick them
up, there were none.
   At least one couple departed for Washington a day too early.
   ``Their tickets are in Oklahoma,'' said volunteer Ann Green.
   Behind the scenes, 14 operators tapped into 14 computers to track
not only inaugural ticket orders but Federal Express deliveries as
well.
   Volunteers periodically emerged from the computer room with news
ranging from ``you should get your ticket'' to ``credit was refused
on the date received and no tickets are available.'' Then there was
the somewhat ominous ``They want to see you back there. Just come
with me.''
   Kathy Dalton of Birmingham, Mich., ordered and paid for four ball
tickets but received only two. ``I'm sure they'll straighten it
out,'' she said calmly. Asked about her equanimity, she replied,
``If it was tomorrow at 6 p.m., I'd be going crazy.''
   But not all was graciousness and patience.
   John E. Davis, a volunteer who was director of error resolution
for President Reagan's 1985 inauguration, said more than 500 people
a day had been taken care of _ one way or another _ since the
process began on Monday. He said many of their problems involved
late orders or illegitimate invitations and had nothing to do with
the inaugural committee.
   ``It's much better this year,'' Davis said. ``In 1981 there were
thousands of errors. In 1985 there were hundreds, and in 1989 there
were dozens.''

<TEXT>
   In the blink of an eye, in a ceremony as old as
the Republic, Ronald Reagan is transformed from Mr. President, the
most powerful man in the world, to Mr. Citizen.
   He will keep the title as an honorific, all the presidents do.
But the mantle of office falls away completely. He becomes nothing
ex-officio, he casts no votes, he has no say, and his counsel _ if
it is sought at all _ is sought as a courtesy.
   He becomes a member of a most exclusive club, that of
ex-presidents, which will number more than three on inauguration day
for the first time since 1861. The others are Reagan's immediate
predecessors, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.
   Ronald Reagan has joked about what he will do immediately.
   ``As soon as I get home to California,'' he said, ``I plan to
lean back, kick up my feet and take a long nap.''
   That won't be so different from other recent presidents.
   Harry Truman took the train home to Independence and said the
first thing he did was to carry the luggage into the attic. The next
morning he was up at 7:30 _ having slept unusually late _ and walked
into his front yard to get the paper.
   ``My return to ordinary citizenship began a new life filled with
new meaning,'' he said afterward. ``After all the crowds and furor,
the whole business did not seem so easy. Were the people going to
let me become a private citizen? Or was I still going to have to
live up to the title of Mr. President that the people insisted on
using?''
   Truman was blessed with living in less dangerous times. At first,
his only added security was the fence that the Secret Service had
put up around the house at 219 North Delaware, and a former highway
patrolman who doubled as chauffeur and bodyguard. He took his
morning walks down to the town square often unnoticed. If you wanted
to talk to him, you had to do it at 120 paces a minute, but you
could do it. Only in his later years were laws passed that beefed up
his protection at government expense.
   Dwight D. Eisenhower, who hated top hats, had dictated the
wearing of homburgs at his own inauguration. John F. Kennedy, aware
of that, mischievously ruled that top hats be worn at his
swearing-in and Eisenhower, as the outgoing president, was forced to
comply.
   No wonder he told reporters, as he was driven out of Washington,
that it was wonderful to shed the burdens of the presidency. He and
Mamie were driven in a four-car convoy to their farm in Gettysburg,
Pa. The next day he attended a dinner thrown in his honor by the
townsfolk and a couple of days later he was in Albany, Ga., shooting
quail.
   The latter was in the tradition set by Theodore Roosevelt who
went on an African safari after leaving the jungles of Washington.
   Ford didn't bother to go home. He stayed long enough to hear
Jimmy Carter's inaugural address, got his helicopter pilot to make
one last swing over the White House and the Capitol, flew to
California and before the day was out was hitting golf balls off a
practice tee.
   The next day he was Arnold Palmer's partner in the Bing Crosby
Pro-Am Tournament at Pebble Beach. Ford told reporters he thought he
had prepared himself well for the swift switch in power. ``We
certainly took the attitude that our time had ended and President
Carter's time had begun,'' Ford said.
   But he wiped away a tear or two at the airport, saying ``I don't
deny I got a little sentimental, but I tried not to expose it, to
keep it within myself.''
   Carter's leave-taking and Nixon's _ for different reasons _ were
the most traumatic.
   Carter had stayed up all night handling final details of a
complicated deal worked out with Iran to gain freedom for 52
American hostages who had been held hostage for 444 days. He
catnapped on the Oval Office couch and left for the Reagan
swearing-in only at the last minute.
   En route to the Capitol, Carter got word the Iranians had agreed
_ but the first planeload did not take off from Tehran until five
minutes into the Reagan presidency.
   The 39th president flew to Georgia in Air Force One and to Plains
in a helicopter. At 4:30 a.m. the next day he boarded the same
aircraft for Germany to greet the returning hostages. Carter flew
back home after a few hours on the ground.
   Nixon, too, had a fitful last night in the White House. On Aug.
8, 1974, he had told the nation that because the Watergate scandal
had eroded his political muscle ``I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.''
   Afterward, his family consoled him and Nixon went to bed with the
sound of protesters outside chanting what his daughter described as
``their sick message.'' In the morning, he had corned beef hash and
poached eggs alone in the Lincoln sitting room, signed a message of
resignation addressed to the secretary of state, and said a tearful
goodbye to his administration.
   ``This was the nightmare end of a long dream,'' he wrote later.
``I had come so far from the little house in Yorba Linda (Calif.) to
this great house in Washington.''
   He, too, flew back home on Air Force One, to years of
self-imposed exile before he ventured forth again.
   ``There was no talk, there were no tears left,'' Nixon said of
seeing the White House retreating in the distance. He leaned his
head back against the seat and closed his eyes, then heard his wife
saying, to no one in particular, ``It's so sad. It's so sad.''

   Andrew Wigglesworth, a
10-year-old boy who lost a leg to a tumor, had a thriller of a day
when he met rock star Michael Jackson in Los Angeles, then visited
Disneyland with actor Martin Sheen.
   ``He was just awe-struck,'' Andrew's mother, Philippa, said of
her son's meeting with Jackson in Los Angeles.
   Sheen, who met Wigglesworth last November when the boy appeared
as an extra in a movie, arranged the trip for Andrew and his mother.
He met them at the airport Tuesday and escorted them to meet Jackson
backstage before a concert.
   During the concert, Andrew stood up in the aisle and began
dancing as Jackson performed the hit, ``Thriller.''
   During the visit to Disneyland on Wednesday the youngster was
mobbed by Disney characters.
   For Sheen, making Andrew's dreams come true was simply ``an
honor.''
   In the end, Andrew couldn't decide what he liked best about the
trip. ``Everything was good,'' he said. ``Everything.''

   Entertainer Wayne Newton says a public survey
satisfied him that his reputation has been restored since he won a
multimillion dollar libel lawsuit against NBC.
   ``This was not a matter of money. This was a matter of
vindication of my name,'' Newton said Thursday after filing papers
in federal court to collect a $6 million libel award against NBC
over a 1980 broadcast linking him to an organized crime figure.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded a record $22.3 million to
Newton in 1986, but a judge reduced it to $5.3 million and last
month ordered him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case
again in a new trial, this time in Los Angeles.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said that with interest, the $5.3
million award now equals $6 million.
   Galane said a survey conducted for Newton satisfied him that his
image had been restored and that the public understood he had won
his case.
   NBC said it would appeal. The network said that a trial in Los
Angeles would be less likely to produce the results seen in Las
Vegas.

   Former world heavyweight champion Muhammad
Ali, who turned 46 this week, says he has no serious health problems
despite reports to the contrary.
   ``The American press portrays me like a dying man,'' he said
Thursday before leaving this West African country after a five-day
visit. ``Behind this campaign are the enemies of Islam. Allah made
me famous and is not going to destroy me. There is nothing serious
about my health.''
   Ali reportedly has Parkinson's Syndrome, an ailment marked by
slurred speech, a shuffling gait and slower reflexes.
   He has said he was looking for another country, besides the
United States, where he could live for six months a year and Senegal
might be the place.
   Asked for his impressions of the country, he said: ``I feel good
in Senegal. ... Here the people are civilized. You feel it in their
eyes and in their faces. The people are warm and above all,
religious.''

   Boxer Lupe Aquino pleaded innocent to
charges of vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving stemming from
an accident in which two of his passengers were killed.
   Aquino, of Santa Paula, entered the plea in Superior Court to two
counts each of vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving Thursday.
A preliminary hearing was set for Feb. 3.
   Killed in the Aug. 14 crash were Howard Thomas, 25, and Teresa
Bello, 20, both passengers in the car driven by Aquino.
   Aquino failed to appear at his Dec. 7 preliminary hearing in
California and was arrested in Detroit on Dec. 9, moments after
losing a World Boxing Association title fight at Cobo Arena.
   He went into the fight, his first after the accident, as the
WBC's No. 3-ranked super welterweight contender. He held the title
briefly in 1987.
   ``The fight I was fighting was outside of the ring,'' Aquino said
after the match.

   Mayor Marion Barry spent nearly three hours
before a federal grand jury that subpoenaed him to testify about his
ties to a drug suspect, but Barry maintained afterward that the
investigation isn't distracting him from his duties.
   ``I have not missed a beat,'' Barry said after his appearance
Thursday at the U.S. District Court building. ``The only thing that
has interrupted my schedule is this grand jury appearance.''
   Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, said he has received assurances
that Barry is not a target of the probe. No federal official could
be reached to comment on Mundy's claim.
   Officials also refused to comment on Barry's appearance before
the grand jury, but had earlier said that investigators are
gathering information on whether Barry thwarted a police drug
investigation and are also looking into the possible misuse of
government funds.
   Mundy described Barry's appearance before the panel as ``a
grueling process,'' but neither he nor the mayor would offer any
details about what Barry had been asked. On his way into the jury
room, Barry had said, ``I'm not in trouble.''
   On Dec. 22, police were inexplicably called off an attempt to
make an undercover drug purchase from a former city employee,
Charles Lewis, after Barry showed up at his hotel room. Barry has
also acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the
affair, but said he was only trying to speed up the probe.
   The grand jury is also hearing testimony on a joint personnel
project involving the district and the U.S. Virgin Islands
government. Lewis, a former city employee, spearheaded that project
for the Virgin Islands.
   He was fired last April after Virgin Islands officials expressed
concern about cost overruns on the project. Barry and other top city
officials ran up hotel and restaurant bills of more than $37,000 in
connection with the project.

<HEAD>Central Illinois Town Willing To Pay For New Residents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OHIO, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This central Illinois community of 550 wants
more residents, and it's willing to pay for them.
   State Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced Thursday he has signed
a check for $100,000 as part of a commitment of up to $1 million
under the state's Linked Deposit Program to help Ohio's population
grow.
   The money will be deposited in a nearby bank, which in turn will
loan up to $5,000 at a low interest rate for families to move to
Ohio, Cosentino said.
   Jack Piper, a local businessman and school board member, said the
community has been suffering from school enrollment declines and
business stagnation.
   ``We decided to do something about our problems,'' Piper said.
``We formed an Ohio Growth Foundation and decided to offer $3,000 to
purchasers of existing homes and $5,000 to families who build new
homes in Ohio.''
   Since the foundation was formed last year, Piper said, five
families have moved to town and five other families are negotiating
with the foundation. One new business has opened, he said.
   Dave Cleverson, a spokesman for Cosentino, said the Linked
Deposit Program has helped about a dozen small towns across Illinois
as well as a number of Chicago neighborhoods and suburbs.

<HEAD>Last-Day Interior Moves Would Benefit Oil Companies</HEAD>

<UNK>Associated Press</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel, in his last
full day on the job, on Thursday lowered the rates oil companies pay
for drilling on federal land and recommended opening the vast Alaska
wildlife refuge to oil exploration.
   The moves are aimed at boosting the nation's sagging oil
production, spokesmen for the Interior Department said in telephone
interviews Thursday.
   Hodel's decision to cut the rental fees for drilling on federal
land by up to two-thirds could cost taxpayers an estimated $35
million annually, The New York Times reported in its Thursday
editions.
   Rental rates which now range from $2 to $3 will be lowered to $1
per acre when the action published in Thursday's Federal Register
takes effect March 1.
   ``This is aimed at lessening the so called regulatory or
anti-productive red tape in hopes that it would be more viable for
domestic concerns to explore and develop new domestic energy
sources,'' said Timothy Lock, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land
Management.
   About 70 million acres of federal land are currently leased by
oil companies, but about half of them are already rented at the $1
per acre rate, said Marta Witt, a spokeswoman for BLM.
   In the second move, Hodel recommended that Congress allow native
Alaska corporations to trade ownership of land they hold for mineral
rights to thousands of acres in the federal Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, Interior Department spokesman Tom Wilson said.
   The right to allow such exchanges rests with Congress.
   The federal land would remain U.S. government property, with the
Indian, Eskimo and Aleut corporations taking over rights to what oil
analysts project as massive oil deposits below the Prudhoe Bay
region.
   ``This is supposedly one of the richest potential spots for oil
left in the United States, off or on shore, said Wilson. ``The
geology is such that oil people feel that it has greater potential
than any place they can think of remaining in this country.''
   The American Petroleum Institute announced on Wednesday that
energy use in this country rose to record levels in 1988 while U.S.
imports jumped 9 percent to the highest levels in nine years. At the
same time, API reported that domestic oil production slumped to 8.1
million barrels a day last year, down 3 percent from 1987.
   Lock, speaking of the decrease in rental rates, said, ``This
action is consistent with other steps the department has taken over
the past two years when oil prices bottomed out and U.S. production
began to dwindle to the point of serious concerns, to the point of
even national security impact.''

<TEXT>
   The leading opposition parties of Panama say
they will present a single candidate in the May 7 presidential
elections against a ticket backed by military strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, leader of the Christian Democrat Party,
said the names of the presidential and two vice presidential
candiates will be announced today.
   Arias Calderon said Thursday that the decision to oppose the
government with a single candidate ``gives the elections the
character'' of a yes-no referendum on Noriega, chief of Panama's
Defense Forces.
   ``It does not matter who the government candidate is, he will be
transparent and the people will see Noriega through him,'' Arias
Calderon said.
   President Ricardo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega, who was
indicted last year by a U.S. federal grand jury on drug charges, but
was deposed by the Noriega-controlled National Assembly and replaced
by Manuel Solis Palma.
   The United States still recognizes Delvalle as leader and has
pressured Noriega to step down and return the country to civilian
rule. It has imposed economic sanctions that include withholding
payments to the country for Panama Canal operations.
   Arias Calderon said the opposition's presidential candidate will
come from the Authentic Panamanian Party and the two vice
presidential candidates from the Christian Democrats and the Liberal
Republican Nationalist Movement.
   Observers believe Guillermo Endara of the Authentic Panamanian
Party will lead the ticket, with Arias Calderon as the first vice
president.
   The government's presidential candidate is to be announced Feb. 1.

<HEAD>Republican Big-Bucks Bash a `Corporate Pig-Out,' Says Democrat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush is riding into the White House on a
flood tide of inaugural revelry by Republican partisans who are
drinking, dancing and spending big bucks with such abandon that one
peevish Democrat called it ``a corporate pig-out.''
   A solemn pause in the virtually non-stop partying came today with
an expected 300,000 spectators due at the West Front of the Capitol
to watch Bush take the presidential oath, his only constitutional
duty of the day.
   Then, after the traditional inaugural parade down Pennsylvania
Avenue, the merrymaking will resume with the new chief executive and
his vice president, Dan Quayle, visiting 60,000 GOP faithful at no
fewer than 11 inaugural balls around town that promise to rock until
the wee hours Saturday.
   Celebrants are paying $175 a ticket for black-tie balls at such
locales as the National Air and Space Museum, where Texans will kick
up their booted heels, while young people will be admitted to two
casual-dress dances at $30 a head.
   Except for a speech before a youth forum Thursday morning, Bush
relinquished the social spotlight for the rest of the day to Quayle.
The Indiana senator was the feature attraction at a vice
presidential reception at the National Museum of American History
and at a dinner-dance of 2,300 fellow Hoosiers in a hotel ballroom.
   Not to be outdone by the hundreds of glitzy Republican bashes
everywhere they looked, Democrats held a ``majority party party'' in
a small ballroom in a downtown hotel and assured everyone that they
weren't sulking.
   ``We're not wallflowers,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark.
``We're power brokers.''
   But Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., couldn't resist taking a swipe
at the opposition. She said the Republican frolicking ``looks like a
corporate pig-out,'' with enough Lear jets parked at National
Airport to outfit an air force.
   ``A lot of minks are going to give their lives for this
weekend,'' she said.
   While the Democrats settled for country singer Jerry Jeff Walker,
a deejay and a bad Ronald Reagan imitator at their party, 12,000
Republicans crowded into the cavernous Washington Convention Center
for a two-hour, nationally televised inaugural gala Thursday night
that was packed with such show business celebrities as Frank
Sinatra, Bob Hope, Julio Iglesias, Nell Carter and country music
stars Randy Travis and Loretta Lynn.
   Seated in a special box with family and friends, Bush clapped his
hands to a foot-stomping song by the Oak Ridge Boys, bounced a
grandchild on his knee and joined Quayle and the black-tie audience
in singing ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''
   The entertainers tossed verbal bouquets at Bush from the stage.
Muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger, dubbing himself ``Conan the
Republican,'' said it was a time for ``new beginnings'' and for
Americans to follow Bush's leadership ``toward a kinder, gentler
nation.''
   Comedian Bob Hope recalled that an earlier president had called
his job a ``splendid misery,'' and told Bush that Americans were
praying that ``it will be nothing but splendid for you.'' After a
rousing song and dance routine, Nell Carter offered to serve Bush as
an ambassador.
   At the end of the show, the president-elect mounted the stage and
promised that ``I'll work my hardest, I will do my best, and with
the help of the American people, I believe we can get the job done.''
   As if to respond to protesters who tried to disrupt the gala and
a lavish, $1,500-a-plate dinner at Union Station the previous night,
Bush said it was ``proper that we salute the stability and
continuity of the American system.''
   Outside the convention center, three dozen gay and lesbian rights
demonstrators shouted at the gala guests arriving in stretch
limousines. ``It's all a sham, it's all a lie, you dance while we
die,'' the protesters chanted.
   Tickets to the sold-out gala ranged as high as $25,000 for
eight-seat ``boxes'' in front of the stage. Those proceeds, plus
$4.9 million from sales of TV commercials, yielded about $9 million
in gross revenues to help defray the record $25 million in costs for
four days of privately financed inaugural festivities.

   Elizabeth Dole came closer to becoming the top
woman in the Bush administration after promising senators she would
implement a ``growth plus'' policy as labor secretary but avoiding
specific answers on the minimum wage and job protection for new
mothers.
   The Senate Labor Committee on Thursday unanimously approved her
nomination after a 2{-hour hearing in which Mrs. Dole outlined a
policy to provide workers with the jobs and skills of the future.
   While the former Transportation secretary and wife of Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., credited the past six years of
uninterrupted economic growth for reducing the nation's jobless rate
to a 14-year low, she said that is not enough for the future.
   ``The mission of the Labor Department must be to coordinate a
strategy of growth plus _ growth plus policies to help those for
whom the jobs of the future are now out of reach because of a skills
gap, family pressures or lack of supportive policies,'' she said.
   Citing an aging labor force growing at a rate of only 1 percent a
year with a shrinking supply of teenage workers, Mrs. Dole said the
future offers unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
   ``We have within our reach the fulfillment of a long-awaited
dream _ that every American who wants a job can have a job,'' she
said.
   But to do it, she said, will require a coordinated effort by
government, business, union, education and community leaders ``to
wipe out illiteracy and enhance skills through basic education,
training and retraining.''
   Mrs. Dole, 52, was picked by Bush on Christmas Eve to be the only
woman in his Cabinet, a role she also held in President Reagan's
administration as transportation secretary from 1983 until October
1987.
   Both she and Labor Secretary William Brock resigned from the
Cabinet then to help her husband's campaign against Bush for the GOP
presidential nomination. Reagan then tapped Ann McLaughlin for the
labor post, where she filled a like role as the only woman in his
Cabinet the last 13 months of his administration.
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
he expects Mrs. Dole's formal nomination, which will be submitted by
Bush just after his inauguration today, to be voted on by the full
Senate next week. Aides said Senate leaders were looking at Jan. 25
as a possible date.
   During her hearing Thursday, Mrs. Dole successfully ducked
several questions on the social legislative initiatives Democrats
are likely to use to test Bush's promise of a ``kinder and gentler
America.''
   ``I share your concern and look forward to working with you on
that issue'' was her answer to a wide variety of questions from
senators trying to pin her down on the minimum wage, parental
leaves, child care, health insurance and pension issues.
   But she indicated she would follow the lead of her predecessor in
``encouraging progressive work-family policies on the part of
businesses and unions _ rather than mandating solutions to the
lowest common denominator.''

   John Tower fails to meet the ethical standards
George Bush envisioned for his administration, says a leading
conservative who wants to testify against the former senator's
confirmation as secretary of Defense.
   ``President Bush had indicated one thing he was going to do was
raise the standards of the people he would be appointing,'' Paul
Weyrich said Thursday. ``The only area where he distanced himself
from Reagan was that whole question. Selecting Tower sends the wrong
signal.''
   Weyrich said he wrote Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, on Dec. 23 and requested a chance
to appear at Tower's confirmation hearings, scheduled to begin Jan.
25.
   A spokesman for Nunn said a decision has not been made on the
request.
   The 63-year-old Tower, who served as chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, was named to become secretary of Defense
selected after a lengthy background check that pushed the Texan's
private life into the forefront.
   There was a bitter divorce, in which Tower's ex-wife charged
``marital misconduct,'' and tales of drinking and womanizing.
Questions also arose about the propriety of naming a someone to head
the Pentagon who had worked as a consultant to many defense
companies.
   Weyrich, chairman of the conservative Coalitions for America
think tank, also expressed reservations about Tower's defense
record, citing his position on the Strategic Defense Initiative,
commonly known as Star Wars, and military reform.
   ``He considers SDI a bargaining chip. We don't,'' Weyrich said.
``He's not in favor of military reform. We think military reform is
necessary particularly in this year of budget crunch.
   ``We wonder how he can possibly carry this stuff out in the
position of secretary of Defense,'' he said.
   Weyrich refused to provide specifics of his complaints, saying he
would save them for his testimony. The conservative official has
spoken informally to members of Nunn's staff about his request for
time but received no indication when the committee might decide.
   Despite his arguments, Weyrich believes that Tower will win
confirmation.
   ``He's a member of the club. The club always protects its own,''
he said.

   The U.S. dollar plunged against the Japanese yen
Friday, while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 128.05 yen, down 1.15 yen from Thursday's
close of 129.20 yen. The currency opened at 128.25 yen, and moved in
a range of 128.00-128.65 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed 43.15
points the previous day, lost another 141.02 points, or 0.45
percent, to finish trading at 31,170.38.
   Share prices were lower across the board, due to concern over
concerted interest rate hikes in Europe on Thursday, dealers said.
   Trading was slow as investors moved to the sidelines to avoid
making major moves except for selling to take profits, said a trader
with a major securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   European central banks, including those of West Germany,
Switzerland, the Netherlands and France, raised their key interest
rates by half a percentage point. In a communique, the West German
central bank said its rate increases were designed in part to
bolster the mark.
   Market analysts said European monetary authorities had been
concerned over a widening gap between interest rates in Europe and
the United States, which has depressed the value of their currencies
against the dollar.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was slowly regaining strength
after its lower opening in Tokyo, which followed an overnight
decline in New York on dollar-selling intervention by European and
U.S. central banks.
   Market sentiment for a higher dollar is still strong, however,
said a Bank of Tokyo dealer.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Destruction Of Computer Records Used In Iran-Contra
Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge is blocking the White House
from destroying National Security Council computer information that
investigators found useful in unraveling the Iran-Contra affair.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker issued a temporary
restraining order Thursday protecting information generated on the
professional office system, or PROFS. The system, put in operation
in 1985, is used by NSC personnel and White House staff to
communicate on an internal electronic mail network.
   Former national security adviser John Poindexter and fired NSC
aide Oliver North used the system frequently. From it, congressional
and criminal investigators retrieved messages in reconstructing the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton argued at a hearing that
stopping the ``housecleaning'' process of getting rid of information
would impair operations of the incoming Bush administration.
   But Parker said the decision to block the destruction was
maintenance of the status quo and questioned whether harm would be
done by keeping information in the system intact.
   Parker issued the restraining order at the request of the
National Security Archive, a private repository of government
information, and a division of the American Civil Liberties Union. A
hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction will be held
Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Charles Richey.
   The groups sued President Reagan, President-elect George Bush and
the archivist of the United States, saying in a statement they are
trying to prevent the destruction of ``historically significant
White House computer tapes ... during the last three years of the
Reagan administration.''
   The information in the system is contained on magnetic tapes
which ``we were told the White House destroys from time to time,''
attorney Kate Martin said at a hearing where Parker granted the
restraining order.
   ``The Iran-Contra affair illustrated the importance of
information stored in the PROFS system,'' Scott Armstrong, founder
of the National Security Archive, a non-profit group, said in an
affidavit. ``Despite repeated attempts by NSC staff to shred the
paper record and delete the computer record, the PROFS backup system
on magnetic tape allowed investigators to reconstruct much of the
Iran-Contra-related activity.''
   The computer tapes ``are the only existing record of many
important communications within the White House and specifically
within the National Security Council at the close of the Reagan
administration,'' Ms. Martin said in a memorandum filed in federal
court.
   Bolton, chief of the Justice Department's civil division said,
however, the destruction is ``not some sinister conspiracy.''
   ``The archivist has given approval to erase these systems'' and
none of the information has ``any relevance'' or ``anything to do
with the Iran-Contra affair,'' said Bolton.
   Bolton compared the system to an electronic mail setup in place
at the Justice Department in which people can play back their
messages when they return to the office rather than having to play
``telephone tag.''
   Guidance issued by the archives and White House counsel instructs
PROFS users to print out in paper form any significant PROFS
messages for the permanent files, and only those paper records are
considered presidential records and permanently preserved.

   They are enraged loners and losers, emotionally tortured time
bombs who attack the helpless as a warped way of getting revenge.
   Three times in the last eight months, such societal rejects have
taken up guns to slaughter school children. Two of them ended up
killing themselves without revealing a motive.
   In a fourth case in Wyoming in 1986, a couple took 150 hostages
at a school and demanded $300 million in ransom as their way of
``showing the system.'' They perished in the foiled attempt.
   ``For these people, it is typically their last chance to show
society how angry they are,'' Michael Mantell, chief psychologist
for the San Diego Police Department. ``Striking out at children is
their way of building up their flagging egos ... Someone who has
given up on life has nothing to lose.''
   Here is a capsule look at those responsible for the carnage:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Patrick Edward Purdy</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   A drifter clad in military flak jacket and olive drab T-shirt, he
opened fire Tuesday on a crowded schoolyard with a bayonet-equipped,
Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifle in Stockton, Calif. He also packed
two pistols.
   After setting fire to his car, he massacred five children of
Southeast Asian refugees and wounded 30 others before killing
himself outside Cleveland Elementary School, which he once attended.
   ``Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy developed a hate for
everybody,'' said police Capt. Dennis Perry. He said Purdy had ``a
problem with alcohol, a problem with marijuana and a distinct
dislike for everybody _ not a particular race, all of them.''
   Steve Sloan, a former co-worker, said Purdy seethed when he spoke
about Vietnamese because he thought they took jobs away from
native-born Americans, but he didn't just single out one group.
   ``He expressed hatred and bitterness and anger toward just about
anybody who asked him to do something,'' Sloan said. ``It always
seemed like he was on the edge of snapping.''
   Purdy, who had a long criminal record and was once arrested for
firing a semiautomatic pistol at trees, tried to commit suicide in
jail in 1987 and was described in a subsequent mental health report
as ``a danger to his health and others.''
   Purdy's olive-drab shirt bore an Iranian battle cry and his rifle
was carved with the words ``freedom'' and ``victory.'' Police found
100 toy soldiers in his motel room.
   ``We can only assume that some problem came up in this guy that
made him do it. Obviously, he had a military hangup,'' Perry said.

   Armed with three handguns, she killed an 8-year-old boy at
Hubbard Woods Elementary School in Winnetka, Ill., and wounded five
other children. She also wounded a man at a nearby home before
killing herself.
   Wearing a shirt with a skeleton on it, she set fire to a house
where she was baby-sitting and mailed packages of poisoned food
before her deadly rampage on May 20, 1988.
   She reportedly made hundreds of harassing, threatening phone
calls to her ex-husband and a former boyfriend, hid raw meat under
seat cushions, wore knit gloves when she ate and was called
``psycho'' and ``elevator lady'' because she rode an elevator day
and night in her dormitory.
   Once arrested for shoplifting, she had been treated by a
psychiatrist for depression and obsessive-compulsive behavior.
   ``She definitely was a very, very confused woman,'' said Winnetka
Police Lt. Joseph Sumner.
   Friends said Dann, a one-time member of a sorority at the
University of Arizona, was quiet and withdrawn.
   ``She wasn't the monster she turned out to be,'' said Peter
Solber, an attorney who represented her in a divorce case.

   A 19-year-old with a history of psychiatric problems and
reportedly a ``fan'' of Laurie Dann, he killed two 8-year-old girls
at Oakland Elementary School in Greenwood, S.C.
   Armed with a .22 caliber pistol he took from his grandmother, the
reclusive Wilson also shot seven other pupils and two teachers in
the cafeteria and a third-grade classroom in the Sept. 26, 1988,
rampage.
   Wilson, a 10th grade dropout whose parents divorced in 1987, had
been hospitalized in the psychiatric ward at Self Memorial Hospital
at least three times and was taking a drug for depression, his
family said.
   He didn't return for more treatments because his family's
insurance benefits were exhausted and they couldn't afford

   Gladys Wilson, the grandmother, said she gave him a framed

   ``I guess he just didn't like himself,'' Mrs. Wilson said. Wilson

   Armed with three gas bombs, nine handguns and four rifles, they
took 150 students and teachers hostage at the Cokeville Elementary
School in Cokeville, Wyo., on May 16, 1986.
   The couple demanded $300 million in ransom. Mrs. Young died whe
she accidentally set off a bomb, and her husband then shot himself.
A music teacher was shot in the back and 74 people suffered
second-degree burns.
   ``He said it was some kind of revolution. He said it was his way
of showing the system,'' said Jerry Deppe, 42, an old school chum
who refused to join the plot and ended up chained to a van.
   Young was fired as marshal of Cokeville after a six-month stint
in 1979.
   ``On his day off, he'd wear a six-shooter on his hip and tie it
off with a thong,'' said Cokeville Mayor John Dayton. ``I think he
was a little off his rocker when we hired him and I think he got
steadily worse.''
   In one of his diaries, authorities found the notation, ``1986:
The year of the biggie.''
   Eva Barnes, who once worked as a cocktail waitress with Mrs.
Young and knew her for 15 years, said the couple stayed with her
while on a nationwide tour of gun shows.
   ``She said, `David isn't in this world anymore,''' said Mrs.
Barnes, adding the woman had planned to leave her husband.

   Inaugural gala guests who waited patiently in
furs and jewels to endure scrupulous security checks were confronted
with protesters audibly upset with the impending presidency of
George Bush.
   ``It's all a sham, it's all a lie, you dance while we die,''
screamed three dozen gay and lesbian rights demonstrators outside
the Convention Center gala Thursday night.
   ``The reason we're here is that $32 million is being spent on the
inauguration,'' said Robert Bray of Washington, a spokesman for the
demonstrators. ``We want to call attention to the fact that there's
a huge problem George Bush must face. He has been handed this legacy
by former President Reagan and he has to handle it.''
   The protesters complied with police requests to keep their circle
moving and to leave part of the sidewalk open for passersby. But
they declined to turn down their megaphone, and police did not
pursue their request for a quieter demonstration.
   Several of the black-tie clad guests expressed annoyance with the
protesters who shouted, ``Money for AIDS, not for inaugurals,'' and
``Bush, Quayle, you can't hide; we charge you with genocide.''
   ``I think they like trying to rain on somebody else's parade,''
said Doug Richardson, who works with the transition for
Transportation Secretary-designate Samuel Skinner.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate at all,'' said Tom Aubrey of the
American Bankers Association, one of 12,000 guests at the nationally
televised gala starring Frank Sinatra, Chuck Yeager, Loretta Lynn
and Randy Travis, among others. ``I don't think a celebratory
evening is the time or place for this kind of demonstration.''
   The protests this week have been peaceful, which was the plan set
by the Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a People's Agenda. The
coalition, which has some 80 member groups ranging from the Gray
Panthers to the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador, agreed in advance not to stage civil disobedience.
   And there was no disobedience among the guests at Thursday
night's gala, who waited calmly, sometimes jammed together, to be
screened by metal detectors and to have their handbags and cameras
scrutinized by uniformed Secret Service officers.
   Back home they may be treated with kid gloves, but at the gala,
everyone got checked, including entertainer Bob Hope.
   ``It'll be a privilege to see George Bush,'' said Mrs. Paul
Harrington of Rochester, N.Y., who was near the end of the line as
it wrapped around the Convention Center. ``I'd wait all week.''
   Linda Skladany of Danville, Va., said the waiting added to the
festivity of the occasion.
   ``It kind of gets your adrenalin going,'' said Mrs. Skladany, who
lost a special election for a congressional seat last July. ``It's
like going to the Super Bowl.''
   Sally Campbell of Slidell, La., said she appreciated the tight
security: ``We don't want anyone to hurt our new president.''
   The Secret Service agents took only a few seconds to check
through most of the handbags _ they were small _ but they regularly
examined cameras by taking off the lens caps and looking through.
   Guests routinely emptied their pockets to keep the magnetometers
from sounding. Out came the keys, off came heavy bracelets. A few
women doffed huge stone-encrusted belts.
   One man whose attempt to walk through the magnetometer set off
the alarm dumped a pile of belongings, including a dozen rolls of
film, even more batteries, a camera and a pipe. He then was cleared
to enter.
   Secret Service agents said they found nothing abnormal except
some of the purses themselves.
   ``Trying to figure out how to get them open was tough,'' one
agent commented.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 aftershocks reverberated
through the Los Angeles area Thursday, echoing a 5.0 quake coastal
quake that shattered shop windows and merchandise but left local
residents generally unfazed.
   The 10:54 p.m. Wednesday quake, centered eight miles off the
Malibu coast in Santa Monica Bay, caused three minor injuries and
briefly knocked out power to 100,000 people.
   The number of aftershocks recorded at the California Institute of
Technology was between 100 and 200, but that was ``not terribly
unusual,'' Hall Daily, a spokesman for Caltech, said late Thursday.
   Most were too small to measure, said Lucile Jones, seismologist
at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   But two aftershocks, one at 2:02 p.m. and the other at 2:09 p.m.,
tentatively measured 3.7 and 3.5 on the Richter scale, respectively.
They were the largest of as many as 200 aftershocks, said Caltech
spokesman Hall Daily.
   The quake shattered windows at the Natural Progression Surf Shop,
Deane's Sportswear, Super Care Drugs and Bay Cities Beauty Supply,
near the Malibu Civic Center. Rocks slid down the twisting Malibu
Canyon Road and blew out some car tires.
   ``There's a million bottles on the ground of dye and hair color
bottles. They're broken and stained the rugs. It's a big mess. We
can't even open,'' said beauty shop worker Becky Granados.
   ``Our front window exploded and a lot of the surfboards fell
over. But they were not injured,'' said surf shop employee Grady
Hinsche.
   Tiles fell off the law school building at Pepperdine University,
and the bar at Alice's Restaurant on the Malibu Pier was littered
with broken bottles.
   As businesses cleaned up, life returned to Southern California
normal in this celebrity enclave 30 miles southwest of Los Angeles,
home of Sylvester Stallone, Johnny Carson, Dustin Hoffman and others.
   Beachgoers tanned on the sands, enjoying near-80 degree
temperatures, and a few surfers paddled in the calm waters.
   The quake, which measured 5.0 on the Richter scale at Caltech,
shook downtown Los Angeles skyscrapers and was felt 60 miles away in
Riverside County.The temblor struck with the same magnitude of a 5.0
earthquake on Dec. 3 that was centered beneath downtown Pasadena.
   The strongest recent earthquake was the deadly Whittier Narrows
quake of Oct. 1, 1987, which measured 5.9 on the Richter scale. That
quake and its 5.3-magnitude aftershock on Oct. 4 killed eight
people, injured more than 200 others and caused $358 million in
damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage.

<TEXT>
   Differences in the brain structure of male
and female rats allow the males to learn to navigate a maze more
quickly, but females are less fooled by changes in landmarks, a
researcher says.
   ``It doesn't suggest that males or females are better at solving
spatial tasks,'' psychologist Christina Williams of Barnard College
of Columbia University in New York City, said Thursday. ``It merely
means they go about it in different ways.''
   Williams and Warren H. Meck, another Columbia researcher, also
found that brain structure can be altered in a way that seems to
improve memory by giving rats choline, a B vitamin rich in foods
common in traditional Japanese diets.
   Williams, speaking at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, said she believed there
were similarities between rats' brains and human brains, but said
she could draw no conclusions about human behavior from the maze
studies.
   ``I have no data on humans,'' she said.
   Male and female rat brains are different because male brains are
exposed to testosterone and related male sex hormones early in the
animal's life, Williams said.
   She has found that female rats exposed to testosterone develop
male-like brains, and males deprived of the hormone develop
female-like brains.
   It has been known that hormones govern the number of cells in the
brain, where cells move as the brain develops, and the strength of
connections between the cells, the researchers said.
   In the dietary study, rats given choline early in their
development can remember more and remember it longer, Meck said.
   Some foods are especially rich in choline, especially soybeans,
rice, seaweed and raw fish, he noted.
   But Meck said there have been no studies yet to determine whether
the choline-rich diet of the Japanese might improve their memories,
and cautioned that people should not begin consuming such foods to
try to improve their memories.
   The researchers also noted that choline and hormones affect the
brain only early in its development, and would have no impact on
adult rat or human brains. The hormones alter rat brains immediately
after birth, and human brains before birth.
   In addition, some choline supplements available in health food
stores also contain fats that could counteract any possible effect
of choline, Meck said.
   Williams said her studies of navigation were intended to
determine how differences in behavior are related to differences in
brain structure.
   Males find food in the maze by learning about the geometric
properties of the maze and the room they're in: angles and
distances, Williams said. But females do more.
   ``Female brains not only store information about these geometric
relationships, but they also store information about landmarks _ the
experimenter, the lack of cages on the left side of the room, or a
large plate glass window in the room,'' she said.
   Thus if shapes and distances are changed, males will have
difficulties. Females, on the other hand, can rely on the landmarks
to orient themselves.
   The reason males learn to get through the maze more quickly may
be that they have less to learn about the room, Williams said.
``Females are storing more stimuli,'' she said.
   Learning and practice, Williams said, can easily compensate for
any sex differences that may be due to differences in brain
structure.

<TEXT>
   Women in southern China allege high-ranking
officials are spending public money at massage parlors, and say the
sexual services offered there are breaking up marriages, a newspaper
reported today.
   A group of women wrote the Canton-based Southern Daily with
complaints about massage parlors in Huidong county, 60 miles
northeast of Hong Kong, the British colony's Ming Pao newspaper
reported.
   Businessmen now prefer visiting massage parlors to banquets for
entertainment, and senior government cadres spend public money at
the rate of up to $13.40 per hour at the parlors for prostitutes,
Ming Pao quoted the letter as saying.
   Although the average salary of an urban Chinese worker is $26.90
per month, individuals can earn much more in the prosperous region
around Canton. Many ordinary workers ``run to the massage parlors
for some fun as soon as they get a little money,'' the report said.
   The report did not specify how many women wrote the letter. It
did not say how many massage parlors operate in Huidong county, nor
did it mention any police action in response to the allegations.
   Chinese officials have acknowledged the emergence of prostitution
as a serious problem around Canton.

<HEAD>New Genetic Findings Allow Early Detection Of `Elephant Man's Disease'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New genetic findings will let doctors diagnose
``elephant man's disease'' before symptoms appear and help
scientists find the gene that causes the disease, which afflicts at
least 100,000 Americans, experts say.
   The findings will also permit prenatal diagnosis, they said
Thursday.
   Early diagnosis will allow doctors to act early to reduce the
severity of the disease, which causes tumors to grow anywhere in the
nervous system, and can lead to severe disfigurement, deafness,
blindness, brain cancers and spinal deformity.
   Some 40 percent to 60 percent of patients also suffer learning
disabilities.
   The findings are ``going to usher in a new era in us being able
to provide services of various types for people with this
disorder,'' said Allan Rubenstein, medical director of the National
Neurofibromatosis Foundation.
   The disease, formally called neurofibromatosis 1, strikes in
about one in every 4,000 live births.
   About half the new cases of the disease result from inheriting
the neurofibromatosis gene, while the other half occur
spontaneously. Diagnostic testing based on the new research will
work only in people with a family history of the disease.
   Finding the gene would allow testing of other people as well,
said Francis Collins of the University of Michigan. And once
researchers isolate the gene and analyze its workings, they should
get hints about how to counter its effects on the body, which could
lead to better treatments, he said.
   The research is reported in the January issue of The American
Journal of Human Genetics by an international consortium of
researchers, led by Collins, Bernd Seizinger of Harvard Medical
School and Bruce Ponder of Royal Marsden Hospital in England.
   The scientists followed up on the 1987 discovery that the gene
causing the disorder lay somewhere within a portion of chromosome
17, one of the 23 versions of the thread-like structures that carry
human hereditary information.
   Their new work narrows the possible location of the gene to about
5 percent of the chromosome. They found genetic signposts, called
markers, that lie close to the gene on each side.
   Since the markers tend to be inherited along with the gene,
people who have them are highly likely to carry the gene as well.
   The markers will be useful for early or prenatal diagnosis in an
estimated 80 percent to 90 percent of families that have had a case
of neurofibromatosis, said Rubenstein.
   Diagnosis is now based on symptoms. Suggestive early signs of the
disease are often noticed shortly after birth. But in about a
quarter of cases, a diagnosis cannot be confirmed until adolescence,
when other symptoms appear, said Rubenstein.
   In addition, he said, perhaps about 10 percent of the nation's at
least 100,000 neurofibromatosis cases lack classical symptoms, so
that no definite diagnosis can be made. That poses a problem as a
person approaches childbearing years and wants to know if he or she
carries the faulty gene, which could be passed to a child,
Rubenstein said.
   By diagnosing neurofibromatosis before symptoms appear, doctors
will know who should be followed closely with physical examinations,
looking for problems that can be treated before they cause serious
trouble, said John Carey, associate professor of pediatrics at the
University of Utah.
   While prenatal diagnosis raises the possibility of an abortion,
that decision is complicated by the fact that most people with
neurofibromatosis live a normal life without serious medical
problems, Carey said.
   Rubenstein said about half of people with the disease have minor
skin lesions and learning disabilities but no major medical
problems, another quarter have significant but correctable medical
problems, and the balance have severe and untreatable medical
problems.
   The disease gained its nickname from a disfigured 19th Century
Englishman who was exhibited at side shows as the Elephant Man. But
since then, researchers have determined he actually had a different
disease.

   But the 48-year-old Wichita State professor with a reputation as

   ``We just enjoy doing experimental theater with percussion,'' he
said. ``Luckily, there's an audience for it.''
   On Sunday, Combs will stage a concert titled, ``Now That Was

Pizza Pans and Velcro).''
   The concert isn't the first such event he has helped put on
during his 19 years at Wichita State. He was involved in ``War
Games,'' a piece written by a colleague for performance by
professional wrestlers and a percussion orchestra that was made into
an award-winning video by a Nebraska educational television station.
   Combs and his colleagues also did a concert with pinball machines
and percussion.
   The latest concert will open with ``Edgard Varese in the Gobi
Desert,'' a piece performed by six percussionists on a variety of
drums. Body slapping _ sometimes called hamboning _ chanting,
fireworks and Velcro tap dancing also are featured.
   A Combs composition called ``Pizza Hut 2-3-4!'' will have several

   Rosanne Ponchick, Teaneck's most famous
tea-totaling teacher, was falling way short of her goal to collect 1
million tea tags.
   But Wednesday, 13 crates of unused tea tags were carted into Ms.
Ponchick's second-grade classroom at Longfellow School. The crates,
courtesy of Tetley Inc., contained 1 million tags.
   Now Ms. Ponchick's students will have to count them, which was
the original reason for the collection, she said Thursday.
   ``It all started when a child asked me what a million was,'' she
said. ``I tried to figure out how to show what it looked like. I
came up with tea tags.''
   Ms. Ponchick said she started collecting the tags about 10 years
ago, but got serious in the past year.
   Media coverage of her collection helped swell the number past
200,000 last fall, including 300 different varieties from around the
world.
   What Ms. Ponchick and her students learned was the difficulty of
collecting a million of anything, let alone counting that far, she
said.
   In Shelton, Conn., Tetley President Hank McInerney got wind of
the project and directed that the 1 million tags, still on rolls in
a warehouse in Williamsport, Pa., be sent to the school.
   The tags have already given the students an important geography
lesson, Ms. Ponchick said. Now they must get the counting right.

<HEAD>Smoking Linked To Heart Problems For First Time, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers reported today they have the first
evidence directly linking smoking and heart disease, but tobacco
industry officials rejected the claim, saying the illness can be
tied to a number of causes.
   The study's authors say smokers were three times more likely than
non-smokers to have angina, or chest pains, and painless periods of
inadequate blood flow to the heart.
   An editorial accompanying the research in the Journal of the
American Medical Association said the study was the long-sought
``smoking gun'' showing a link between smoking and heart ailments.
   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the tobacco industry's
Washington-based Tobacco Institute, disputed that, saying, ``This is
not really enough evidence to make such a claim.''
   Miller noted the study involved only two dozen smokers. Forty-one
non-smokers also participated.
   The study, based at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, was
conducted by attaching a monitor to patients' hearts. The patients,
all of whom had been diagnosed as having heart disease, wore the
monitors for 24 hours while they went about their daily routines.
   In tests from October 1984 to December 1987, the monitors showed
975 ischemic episodes, or periods of inadequate blood flow, 8
percent of which were accompanied by chest pains, the report said.
The median number of episodes over 24 hours was three for smokers,
one for non-smokers.
   Dr. Andrew Selwyn, a co-author of the report and a Harvard
Medical School associate professor, said ischemic episodes damage
the heart temporarily and can lead to heart attacks.
   But the short-term effects are ``reversible and very treatable,''
the cardiologist said. ``That's what makes it useful to show (the
study) to patients and say `Look, you haven't damaged your heart
yet, so stop smoking now,''' he said.
   ``This is a solid piece of evidence you can show patients before
they actually have a heart attack,'' Selwyn said. ``I hope it's
ammunition that doctors use to show patients as often as possible.''
   The Tobacco Institute spokesman, however, said ``anything can
cause these ischemic episodes. Caffeine, excitement can cause them.''
   The study showed that the episodes lasted longer among smokers,
whose median episode lasted 24 minutes compared with 2 minutes for
non-smokers.
   Both frequency and duration increased as the number of cigarettes
increased, the study said.
   ``The more they smoke in general, the more ischemia they have and
the greater their risk of heart attack and death,'' Selwyn said.
   The accompanying editorial said research on smoking and heart
disease until now has been based on indirect evidence.
   What had been lacking was direct evidence, a ``smoking gun''
linking the two, wrote Dr. Peter F. Cohn of the Health Sciences
Center of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

<HEAD>NIH Approves Experimental Human Cancer Treatment Using Altered Genes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health authorities are allowing the use
of a rat virus as part of an experimental treatment of humans for
melanoma, a devastating and often fatal skin cancer.
   The decision Thursday by the National Institutes of Health and
the Food and Drug Administration represents the first approval of a
therapy using foreign genes transferred into human patients.
   The subjects in the experimental treatment will be 10 patients in
advanced stages of melanoma.
   The study is aimed at increasing an understanding of a promising
new cancer treatment called tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy,
or TIL, that was pioneered by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, a National
Cancer Institute researcher who will supervise the experiment.
   In TIL therapy, tumor-fighting white blood cells the body
develops in small numbers are removed from melanoma tumors, allowed
to grow in large numbers in the laboratory and then are reinjected
into the patient along with interleukin-2, a protein that promotes
white blood cell growth.
   Rosenberg published a paper last month in the New England Journal
of Medicine in which he reported that of the melanoma patients who
had not previously been treated with interleukin-2, 60 percent
experienced at least a 50 percent reduction in tumor tissue after
TIL therapy. The study involved 20 patients.
   To understand why TIL therapy works for some, but not others,
Rosenberg wants to trace the white blood cells after they are
returned to the patient. In order to do this, the researcher wants
to mark the cells with a bacterial gene that produces a resistance
to neomycin, an antibiotic. In this way, cells from the patient's
tumors or blood stream could be identified and movement of the cells
into the tumors could be monitored.
   But in order to get the gene of the bacteria into the white blood
cells, Rosenberg proposed to use a mouse leukemia retrovirus. It was
the use of this virus that triggered seven months of hearings before
various committees of the NIH, FDA and Congress.
   Rosenberg said the virus is crippled and harmless to humans, but
it retains it ability to carry a gene from one cell into another
cell.
   ``This has probably been the most carefully reviewed clinical
protocol ever,'' said ``Every one has examined the safety issues and
all have decided that the risks are minimal.''
   He said the plan called for using the virus to carry the
neomycin-resistant gene from the bacteria into the TIL cell. Once
this is done, the altered TIL cells are injected into the patients
where it is believed they would migrate naturally to the tumor sites.
   Later, biopsies would be made of the tumors and the removed cells
would be exposed to lethal doses of neomycin. Cells that had been
genetically manipulated would not die because they carry the
neomycin-resistant gene. In this way, Rosenberg said the researchers
would be able to determine the movement of the TIL cells into the
tumor.
   If the experiment proves successful, Rosenberg said researchers
could then use genetically manipulated TIL cells to carrying other
cancer-fighting genes to the tumors, in this way boosting the body's
own immune system to fight the cancer.
   Rosenberg said the clinical experiment could begin within a few
days and preliminary results should be known within three months.

   California researchers using a type of electron
microscope were able to create a direct visual image of the DNA
molecule, an accomplishment they say will enable scientists to speed
up efforts to map the human genetic code.
   The image collected by the microscope shows the double helix coil
that is the molecule of DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, magnified one
million times. A report on the study was published today in Science,
the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of

   Rod Balhorn, a biologist at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, said Thursday the development is a major advance in the
study of genetics because scientists for the first time will be able
to actually see extremely small molecules that perform key functions
in the cell.
   ``This is a major new tool that will enable us to actually
visualize molecules and atoms, something that has not been possible
before,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Balhorn said the image enables scientists to clearly see the
major and minor grooves between strands of the helix coil, and to
pick out specific protein pairs within the helix.
   The DNA molecule is made up of paired proteins whose sequence
determines the genetic traits of a cells. In effect, DNA forms the
biological blueprint for an organism.
   DNA has been imaged with scanning tunneling microscopes before,
but only after the molecule had been shadowed with metal.
   Balhorn said the new imaging system may enable scientists to
speed up their attempt to map the human genetic code ``by one
thousandfold.'' He said current, cumbersome techniques would require
more than 20 years. Mapping the human genetic code, or genome, would
enable scientists to determine the precise location and function of
each human gene.
   He cautioned, however, that it may take biologists time to
develop the new technique to its full potential.
   To make the DNA image, researchers placed a drop of solution
containing DNA from thymus gland cells of a calf on a graphite chip
and then placed the specimen in the scanning tunneling microscope.
   The sensor of the microscope is a sharp-tipped needle that can be
passed within the width of an atom over the specimen. As it passes,
a current of electrons leaps across the gap, a phenomenon known as
``tunneling.'' While the tip moves, the electrons scan the shape of
the specimen, and this motion causes the tip to moves slightly. This
motion is interpreted by a computer to create a three-dimensional
image.
   In addition to Balhorn, co-authors of the study were Thomas P.
Beebe Jr., Troy E. Wilson and Wigbert J. Siekhaus of Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, Cal., and D. Frank
Ogletree, Miquel B. Salmeron and Joseph E. Katz of Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.

<HEAD>Bridge Over River Thames Closed After Tugboat Rams It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tugboat towing two barges rammed the center of a
bridge over the River Thames, forcing authorities to close it to
traffic, police reported.
   The Battersea Road bridge that was struck late Thursday is a main
thoroughfare and its closure threatens traffic disruption in the
already badly congested capital during the morning rush hour.
   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said the bridge would be inspected
today during low tide to assess the damage and decide whether it
could reopen.
   ``The tug Touchstone was negotiating the river with two barges
when it struck the northeast corner of the center arch,'' said the
spokeswoman, who in accordance with British practice declined to be
named.
   ``Traffic diversions will be in place but it is going to cause
some congestion,'' she added.
   She said it was not immediately clear how much damage was caused
but said no one was hurt.

<HEAD>Little Improvement In Species On Endangered List, Study Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concern with public relations is causing the
Fish and Wildlife Service to concentrate on rescuing the more
visible and popular endangered species rather than those in the
nearest danger, a government study says.
   The General Accounting Office, in a study of the Endangered
Species Act 15 years after its passage, said Thursday an
overwhelming majority of the hundreds of fragile varieties of
wildlife protected by the law either show no signs of recovery or
are sliding closer to extinction.
   The congressional agency criticized the Fish and Wildlife Service
for concentrating on high-profile species, such as the bald eagle
and Aleutian Canada goose, over those that are more seriously
threatened.
   Fish and Wildlife Service officials told GAO investigators that
``the desire for a positive public view of the program ... is
motivating its actions,'' said the report.
   ``Instead of giving priority to the most endangered species and
to those actions needed to prevent extinctions in the foreseeable
future, as required by its guidelines, FWS instead is concentrating
recovery funds on species with high `public appeal' and those
approaching recovery,'' the study said.
   Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., who requested the study, said the
agency's conclusions ``reinforce my own view that a more serious and
professional approach to protecting endangered species is required
if the goals of federal law are to be met.''
   Studds is chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries
subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation.
   Elizabeth Lipscomb, a spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife
Service, which has jurisdiction over the vast majority of the
threatened and endangered species listed, defended the agency's
programs and practices.
   ``We feel that it's important to devote resources to species that
the public is concerned about, high visibility species like the bald
eagle,'' she said. ``That doesn't necessarily mean we're not
spending money on other species. We're spending money on a lot of
obscure species that people don't know about.''
   The GAO study said of the 493 species protected under the
Endangered Species Act of 1973, five have been declared recovered
while six have become extinct.
   The review also concluded that while 75 of the species have
improved, 165 have declined, 12 are extinct but not yet official
declared so and 179 have shown no change. The status of the
remaining 51 of the species was not known.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service had drafted by September 1987
recovery plans for 56 percent of the species and had plans underway
for another 18 percent, the GAO said. But many of the tasks outlined
in the plans to save the species have not been started.
   In 16 recovery plans analyzed by GAO investigators, nearly half
of the tasks have not been undertaken even though the plans were
approved on an average of more than four years ago.
   The GAO report said 12 species are extinct but have yet to be
declared so. They are: Mariana mallard, Mariana fruit bat, Palos
Verdes blue butterfly, Scioto madtom, Bachman's warbler, giant
anole, tuberculed-blossom mussel, turgid-blossom mussel,
yellow-blossom mussel, dusky seaside sparrow, ivorybilled woodpecker
and eastern cougar.
   Five species have been declared recovered, but the protections of
the Endangered Species Act seem to account only for the recovery of
the American alligator, GAO said. The recovery of the brown pelican
in the southeastern United States seems to be attributed to the
nationwide ban on DDT, while the ``recovery'' of the Palau dove,
Palau fantail and Palau owl simply stems from the discovery of more
birds.

   A new process of baking bread without wheat can help
feed the hungry in developing countries, the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization says.
   Baking bread with rice, cassava, maize, barley, millet or sorghum
will give impoverished farmers new cash crops and provide an
alternative to countries that cannot grow wheat or afford to import
it, the agency said Thursday.
   ``You can imagine what this will mean to countries like Nigeria
that banned imports of wheat several years ago for financial
reasons,'' said FAO spokesman Richard Lydiker.
   Agency officials said the new method will not eliminate the need
for food aid in countries that can't produce enough food or are
struck by natural calamities such as flood or drought.
   ``We are saying that other countries have the resources to be
self-sufficient in this major food item and that this can help
them,'' said Christian H. Bonte-Friedheim, an assistant general
director of the agency.
   Morton Satin, the official credited with developing the process,
said FAO already is discussing it with Sudan and Nigeria. He said
countries such as Cuba also have expressed interest.
   FAO gave reporters samples of the various breads baked with the
new process. The slices were tasty, varied in color from white to
the color of rye and had a texture similar to Italian wheat bread.
   Agency officials said by baking the new breads developing
countries can open new markets for local crops while reducing their
dependence on food imports.
   According to FAO statistics the consumption of wheat in
developing countries has increased steadily the past 40 years while
consumption of local crops has declined.
   The situation is complicated because wheat is often sold to
developing countries at below-market prices or sent as food aid,
said Satin, who also is chief of FAO's Food and Agriculture
Industries Service.
   As a result, the cost of wheat can be low and create a hurdle to
agricultural development by discouraging domestic production of
other foods. Crops that once produced excellent yields are being
relegated to the role of subsistence crops.
   Bonte-Friedheim said the process also is seen as a way to stop
the exodus of people from the rural areas to the cities in the
developing world.
   Wheat can easily be made into bread because it has a major
protein complex, called vital wheat gluten, that traps the gas
necessary for bread.
   The other grains lack that protein. However, Satin discovered a
mixture of water and flour made from one of those grains could be
boiled to produce a thick gel that can trap the gases. That gel is
then mixed with more of the flour to produce a batter for bread.

   Two private consultants who were implicated in
the ongoing investigation of Pentagon corruption were barred along
with their companies from doing business with the Navy.
   The sanctions Thursday were ordered against William L. Parkin, of
Alexandria, Va., and his consulting firm, Crest Inc., and Fred H.
Lackner, of Woodland Hills, Calif., and his company, Acris
Associates.
   The action had been expected since Jan. 10, when the Pentagon
announced that Lackner, Parkin and several other companies and
individuals were being considered for suspension as a result of a
federal indictment.
   The indictment alleges that Teledyne Electronics and its
employees paid Parkin to obtain details about a Navy radar contract
worth more than $100 million. Parkin then paid Lackner, who in turn
gave bribes to Stuart Berlin, a Navy contracting officer, the
indictment asserts.
   All three men have pleaded innocent.

   Five American servicemen died as a result of
hostile action last year, according to a Pentagon report on deaths
from all causes among military personnel.
   All told, the Defense Department charted 1,833 deaths in fiscal
1988 from all causes among the roughly 2.1 million men and women on
active duty. By contrast, the number of military deaths totaled
1,990 in fiscal 1987; 2,240 in fiscal 1986; 2,017 in fiscal 1985;
2,313 in fiscal 1984; and 2,204 in fiscal 1983.
   The report, released Thursday, covers the 12-month period from
Oct. 1, 1987, to Sept. 30, 1988.
   Of the five who died in hostilities, three were sailors or
officers killed by terrorist bombings in Italy, Spain and Greece.
The other two were Marine aviators killed when their Cobra

   The spiral-bound notebooks that Oliver North
used while on the National Security Council staff will be excluded
from his trial in the Iran-Contra case if North's lawyers have their
way.
   A filing this week challenges a prosecution subpoena for the
notebooks, which North kept from Feb. 1, 1983, until he was fired
Nov. 25, 1986, when the administration disclosed that proceeds from
arms sales to Iran were delivered to the Contras in Nicaragua.
   The existence of the motion was disclosed when U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell issued an order that North's filing outlining
his opposition be sealed to protect references to a grand jury
transcript.
   Portions of the notebooks were turned over to the congressional
Iran-Contra investigating committees and disclosed during hearings.
   But North, through his attorney Brendan Sullivan, invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination last year when a
Senate committee tried to get the notebooks.

   A $35,000 racehorse bound for a track in
New Jersey was killed when his trailer jackknifed into a guardrail
on Interstate 95, throwing him down an embankment.
   Motoring Dean, a 7-year-old pacer that had been listed as a
15-to-1 longshot, died about an hour after the accident despite
rescue efforts by emergency medical technicians.
   The horse had been scheduled to make his first start in a year
Thursday night at the Meadowlands, competing for a $7,500 purse in a
one-mile race. Instead, he was listed as a scratch.
   Miguel Paquette of Wrentham, Ma., the horse's owner, trainer and
driver, was driving south on the highway when another car cut him
off, state police said. Paquette told troopers the trailer
jackknifed when he put on his brakes, causing his pickup to roll
over and crash into the guardrail.
   The horse was thrown out of the trailer and tumbled down the hill
into a tree, breaking his right leg.

   A former Hungarian police captain charged with
kidnapping more than 8,000 Jews during World War II will stand trial
next week for crimes against humanity, a court official said.
   Imre Fintawas the first person to be charged by the government
with war crimes. He will be tried Wednesday in a Toronto court, said
Mary Dayton, trial co-ordinator.
   Finta, 77, a former restaurant owner in Toronto, was a captain in
the Hungarian Mounted Police during the war, Ms. Dayton said
Thursday.
   He is accused of kidnapping and confining 8,615 Jews in the
German-occupied city of Szeged in 1944 for transport out of the
country, causing the deaths of many in crowded trains.
   Finta faces four war crimes counts and four counts of crimes
against humanity under war crimes legislation passed in 1987.
   Some of the testimony in the case will be taken from witnesses in
Hungary and Israel because many of them are too old and frail to
travel to Canada.
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles has said that as many
as 6,000 war criminals came to Canada after the war. A goverment
commission reported in 1987 that only 20 cases required urgent
action and another 218 were worthy of investigation.
   During Nazi German rule from 1933 to 1945, 6 million Jews were
systematically killed in what came to be known as the Holocaust.

   Police arrested a high school student on
charges he telephoned his school cafeteria claiming all the food had
been poisoned, forcing officials to throw away about $2,000 worth of
lunches.
   Peter Frederick Arnold, 19, was charged with making harassing and
threatening telephone calls. He remained in the High Point Jail
under $2,000 bond Thursday night.
   Arnold, the younger brother of state Rep. Steve Arnold, was
charged with telephoning cafeteria manager Manilla Dunlap at Andrews
High School Wednesday morning and telling her that arsenic was in
all the cafeteria's food.
   Arnold was arrested after the call was traced to an office in
Andrews High School, and police narrowed down a list of people who
could have used the phone, said Capt. G.W. Thomas of the High Point
Police Department.
   Dunlap said the caller told her he was on drugs and had taken a
hypodermic needle of arsenic and shot it into the cafeteria's food
Tuesday afternoon.
   ``We talked for 10 minutes,'' Dunlap said. ``He started off by
saying he was on drugs _ cocaine, marijuana, the whole bit. He had
come into the cafeteria and injected a needle into milk and poisoned
the food. He said he felt so bad and guilty about it he had to tell
us we were going to kill all those people.''
   It was not immediately known whether the food was actually
contaminated. Arnold, a senior, was expelled from school for the
rest of the year and will not be able to graduate, said Owen
Phillips, superintendent of the High Point school system.

<TEXT>
   A judge so overcome with emotion he had to leave
the bench sided with the mother of a 12-year-old cancer victim,
denying the father's request for risky surgery that may not prolong
the boy's life.
   ``This ruling cannot be read as a condemnation of one parent over
the other,'' Cook County Judge Thomas J. O'Brien said Thursday.
``The evidence was overwhelming that both are loving parents.''
   Saying the boy ``is tragically too young to die,'' O'Brien choked
up after delivering his ruling and rushed from the bench to his
chambers. He returned soon afterward.
   The ruling gives Miriam Soloveichik the authority to determine
her son's medical treatment in accordance with doctors'
recommendations.
   Doctors at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, where
Yisroel Soloveichik has been hospitalized since being diagnosed with
brain-stem cancer two years ago, said he probably has less than two
months to live.
   Moshe Soloveichik, 39, the boy's father and an orthodox Jewish
rabbi, had sought a surgical procedure to help drain fluid from the
child's brain to relieve pressure.
   The boy' father felt surgery ``would prolong the boy's life
without exposing him to any prolonged suffering,'' said Howard
London, Soloveichik's attorney.
   Doctors, however, said surgery could be risky and may not prolong
his life.
   Soloveichik was ``very disappointed'' by the ruling, but had not
decided whether to appeal, London said.
   ``There are few winners in a case like this. This is a genuine
tragedy if there ever was one,'' said Christopher Cohen, the
mother's attorney.
   ``The only winner, if there is one, is the boy, in that he will
be allowed to die in comfortable surroundings.''
   The boy is on a respirator and fed intravenously. He is unable to
communicate or hear.
   O'Brien's ruling specifies that life support systems now in use
are not to be withdrawn.
   ``Neither of the parents suggested withdrawing any existing
life-support procedures. This is not what is colloquially called a
`pull-the-plug' case,'' Cohen said.
   ``There are no reported cases in the United States exactly like
this,'' with parents suing each other over medical treatment for a
terminally ill child,'' he added in a telephone interview after the
ruling.
   The Chicago couple, who have four other children and are still
living together, filed lawsuits against each other last week.
   The father asked the court to give him sole custody of the boy so
he could approve the surgery. Doctors at Rush opposed it, so
Soloveichik proposed having it performed at another hospital.
   In her lawsuit, Mrs. Soloveichik sought to prohibit the surgery
and keep the boy at Rush.
   The judge ruled in her favor, against a transfer.
   Catherine Ryan, an attorney for the hospital, called the ruling
``very thoughtful, very caring ... and correct.''

<HEAD>Top Labor Official Resigns, Election For Replacement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uzi Baram, a top Labor Party official who
opposed the center-left party's coalition with the right-wing Likud
bloc, has resigned from his party post, Labor officials said.
   Baram's resignation as party secretary-general, submitted
Thursday, deepened a split in Labor ranks and opened the way for a
possible challenge to the leadership of longtime party head Shimon
Peres.
   Baram strongly opposed Peres' decision last month to form a
coalition with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud, insisting the
left-leaning party should work in opposition to the government.
   The daily Jerusalem Post said earlier this week that Baram
reflects the view of ``the very sizable minority in the party'' that
Labor has submerged its principles by becoming a junior partner in
the government. Peres is finance minister in the new government.
   Some Labor members have expressed dismay with the coalition
agreement banning contacts with the Palestine Liberation
Organization. The United States opened a dialogue with the PLO last
month after Yasser Arafat said he recognized the existence of Israel
and renounced terrorism.
   The PLO is viewed in Israel as a terrorist group. But some
prominent Labor doves, including Baram, have said Israel should
recognize the political changes in the Middle East since Arafat's
recent statements and try to push forward the peace process.
   Baram, the chief administrator of Labor since 1984, had announced
his intention to leave at a news conference shortly after the
coalition government was formed.
   The party said today it had scheduled a meeting of its
1,300-member Central Council for Feb. 2 to elect a replacement for
Baram.
   Any challenge to Peres' leaderhip is not likely to emerge in the
election for secretary-general, however. Peres is supporting
parliament member Micha Harish, who announced earlier this week he
also had the support of Baram.
   Several potential candidates for the post dropped out to make way
for Harish. Parliament member Ora Namir, from the most liberal wing
of the party, said earlier this week she was still deciding whether
to contest for the post.

Revolution of 1917 reunited in a Montreal airport, and a relative
said the look on their faces was ``worth a million dollars.''
   Yetta Izenwasser, 93, said the reunion Thursday with her
82-year-old sister from the Soviet Union, Leya Lavit, was among the
happiest days in her life.
   ``I'm so glad I lived long enough to see my sister again,'' said
Mrs. Izenwasser, seated in a wheelchair at the Dorval Airport
terminal. ``After 72 years, I thought I would never see her again.''
   Mrs. Izenwasser's daughter, Ruth Eisenberg, said her mother was
so nervous before driving to the airport that she needed medication
to calm her.
   And when they finally met, Ms. Eisenberg recounted: ``They didn't
say a word to each other, but the expression on their faces was
worth a million dollars.''
   Mrs. Lavit, of Minsk, received a visa this year from the Soviet
government to visit North America, said her son Mike Lavit, who
lives in Chicago and accompanied his mother to Montreal.
   Mrs. Lavit, who arrived in Chicago on Nov. 13, flies back to
Minsk on Feb. 11.
   ``She prepared for a long time what she would say and do but when
she tried talking to her sister, she started crying and couldn't
talk,'' Mike Lavit said. A few hours later, Ms. Eisenberg said her
mother and aunt were talking up a storm at her home in suburban
Laval.
   She was astonished to hear that Mrs. Lavit remembered Mrs.
Izenwasser's old boyfriend in Russia. Mrs. Lavit was only 10 years
old when the czarist regime in Russia fell during the March 1917
revolution and her sister left for the United States.

<HEAD>Looking For Landmines, Soldiers Find Memories</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAM LO, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They came to look for landmines laid two
decades ago, but they found haunting reminders of slain friends and
friendly encounters with old enemies.
   Bill Johnson, a 41-year-old sign maker from Manchester, Conn.,
was among the six former U.S. Marines who returned to Vietnam this
week on a 10-day goodwill tour.
   He wept as he walked through Cam Lo and remembered the men he
knew who died here. In 1968, he was part of the 11th Engineers, a
Marine battalion that swept the highways of Viet Cong mines and
planted their own to protect U.S. bases.
   He remembers narrowly missing a trip to Cam Lo.
   ``Fortunately for me, we had gone on a detail to do some work and
something fell on my foot and broke my toe,'' said Johnson.
   It forced him to stay in the rear base at Dong Ha. Another
sergeant took over for him as the Marines swept Highway 9 westward
to Cam Lo, where they stayed overnight.
   That night, a North Vietnamese battalion attacked Cam Lo. The
first rocket-propelled grenades hit the squad's truck, around which
the men were sleeping. Some died in the fire.
   The string of U.S. bases from which these Marines operated was
just below the former Demilitarized Zone that divided the warring
North and South at the 17th parallel. But the former Marines, five
of them members of that battalion, never got as far as the DMZ until
this week.
   ``Ever think you'd be standing here?'' asked Nate Genna, a
41-year-old maintenance worker from Boston.
   ``No way, brother,'' replied Gene Spanos, 39, a police lieutenant
in Rosemont, Ill., as the two crossed the Ben Hai bridge that had
divided the country until it was reunified in 1975 when the North
won the war.
   They were escorted by Col. Ho Minh Thanh, who during the war had
tried to kill the Marines by planting land mines on the highways
they traveled.
   ``He put them in, we took them out,'' said Johnson. ``He was
putting in the mines at night that we were taking out in the morning
in the road. That was his speciality. He said he was good at it.
We're glad we were good at our work or we wouldn't be meeting each
other today.''
   ``Both the American people and the Vietnamese people don't like
war,'' said Thanh. ``Now we talk. We don't want to fight each other
again. We want to be friends, not enemies.''
   ``I don't feel any bitterness,'' said Johnson. ``Some veterans
may probably, some families who lost a son. If you look at the
reality, these people were hurting as bad as we were. I hope nobody
back in the States looks negatively on our visit here.''
   At the government guesthouse in Dong Ha where the Marines stayed,
children waited at the gate each day to cheer them as they left and
as they returned.
   And when the Marines got out of their van and began retracing
their steps northward, reminiscing, scores of children followed
behind, almost as if they were leading a parade.
   Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old farmer from Langdon, Kan., brought
with him a photo of a Vietnamese woman and her infant son he had
taken 20 years ago while building a road to Con Thien.
   Wallace had asked Col. Thanh if the woman was still around.
   Sure enough, Thanh knew her well and led Wallace and the other
Marines to her thatched-roof hut in Chau Hau village, just off the
dirt road.
   There, to his surprise and delight, he was reunited with Hoan Thi
Chit, 56, and her son, now 25. They smiled and posed for pictures.
The son put his arm around Wallace's waist.
   But there was a bigger surprise. As they left, Col. Thanh told
him Mrs. Chit had been his top Viet Cong agent.
   The Vietnamese colonel and the ex-Marine both laughed.

<TEXT>
   The government today put the finishing touches on a
budget proposal that includes the largest spending increase in eight
years and more than $30 billion for defense.
   Under the Finance Ministry's proposal, released Thursday, Japan
also would lead the world in aid to developing nations.
   The proposal would raise total government spending by 6.6 percent
to $469.93 billion, up from $441 billion in the initial budget for
fiscal 1988 _ the largest rise since a 9.9 percent increase in
fiscal 1981.
   Defense spending would rise to $30.28 billion, up 5.2 percent
from the previous fiscal year but still below 1 percent of the
estimated 1989 gross national product of $3.03 trillion.
   Defense spending in the current fiscal year amounted to $28.78
billion, slightly more than 1 percent of Japan's projected gross
national product. The spending level ended Japan's 11-year policy of
limiting defense spending to less than 1 percent of the total value
of the nation's goods and services.
   Military spending is a sensitive issue in Japan. The constitution
renounces war and use of force to settle international disputes. The
annual increase in Japan's defense spending has remained the same
the last two years.
   Japan has been raising its defense spending under a program aimed
at giving it the capability to repulse small-scale, limited
aggression. In the case of a larger attack, it would rely on help
from the United States under their mutual defense treaty.
   The United States has been urging Japan to build up its defenses
more quickly, particularly its ability to protect vital sea lanes.
   Japan instead has assumed a greater share of the cost of
maintaining U.S. bases on its soil _ by 1990 it will pay more than
half. The budget proposal calls for a 16 percent increase over the
previous year $1.09 billion.
   Japan also has sought to boost its aid to developing nations.
   In formulating the draft budget, the ministry ``paid close
attention to the relationship between the growth rate of Japan's
overseas development assistance and its defense spending,'' a senior
Finance Ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
   Japan's total proposed spending on aid to developing countries is
expected to reach $10 billion in fiscal 1988 and hit $11 billion in
fiscal 1989, he said.
   According to estimates by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, both figures put Japan ahead of the
United States as the largest donor of aid to developing countries.
The Foreign Ministry is expected to lobby for greater aid in budget
negotiations beginning today, the official said.
   After negotiations with its agencies, the government is expected
to adopt a budget proposal based on the Finance Ministry's draft on
Tuesday. The budget usually is passed by Parliament in February. The
fiscal year begins April 1.
   Due to differing fiscal years and accounting techniques, it is
difficult to draw direct comparisons between foreign aid budgets.
The $14.5 billion U.S. foreign aid proposal for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 includes military aid.
   Japan's aid budget includes no military expenditures.
   In 1987 Japan spent $7.45 billion in development assistance, up
32.3 percent from a year earlier, and was second to the United
States, which extended $8.78 billion in such assistance.
   Measured against the size of its economy, Japan's aid is not
outstandingly generous. This year it will be about 0.3 percent of
the gross national product, higher than the U.S. rate of 0.23
percent but below the average of 0.36 percent among major Western
donor nations.

   More pupils returned to class in the wake
of the bloody attack on the Cleveland School and children recovering
from wounds showed signs of spirit, with one 6-year-old telling her
mother, ``I'm really mad.''
   Eight children were listed in stable condition at hospitals
Thursday night and six others who were wounded, including teacher
Janet Geng, were in fair condition.
   Five children were killed and 30 people were injured Tuesday when
Patrick Edward Purdy slipped onto the campus and opened fire on the
schoolyard with an AK-47 assault rifle, then shot himself to death.
   Sara Colvin, 6, recovering at Doctor's Hospital in Lodi from a
bullet wound in the thigh, sat up and combed her doll's hair, her
mother said. Susan Colvin said her daughter told her: ``I'm mad, I'm
real mad'' about being shot.
   A semblance of normality returned to the school Thursday when 674
students showed up for class _ more than double the 275 who came to
school the day after Tuesday's tragedy. A total of 986 students are
enrolled.
   During recess, screams of play, not terror, were heard on the
playground. One boy burst out of a doorway, holding a broomstick as
if it were a rifle.
   ``I've got a shotgun for you,'' he shouted to no one in
particular before darting back inside the doorway.
   Mary Gonzales Mend, superintendent of the Stockton Unified School
District, said the children's outlook was improving.
   ``I've been told ... the kids are feeling a little bit more
secure, but it's hard to tell sometimes,'' Mend said. ``I'd say in
general it's better but they're still mourning their friends.''
   Donations continued pouring into several funds set up by
businesses and a television station to help the children.
   Although 71 percent of the children enrolled in kindergarten
through sixth grade at the elementary school are Southeast Asians,
police on Thursday dismissed racism as a possible motive.
   ``Through his lifetime, Mr. Purdy developed a hate for
everybody,'' said police Capt. Dennis Perry at a crowded news
conference.
   Purdy, 26, was a ``loner, (with) no friends, no particularly
known girlfriends, a problem with alcohol, a problem with marijuana
and a distinct dislike for everybody _ not a particular race,
everybody,'' said Perry.
   Steve Sloan, who worked with Purdy at a Stockton machine shop,
said he remembered a conversation in which Purdy expressed his
dismay at how well Vietnamese refugees were treated in the United
States.
   ``We allow Vietnamese to come in and we give them a place of
residence and a car and money and help to find a job,'' Sloan said
in describing Purdy's attitude.
   ``I'm sure he did'' harbor a dislike for Vietnamese, Sloan added,
but said Purdy never singled out any racial or ethnic groups.
Earlier, the Sacramento Bee reported that Sloan said he had heard
Purdy express hatred of Vietnamese.
   Purdy, who attended the Cleveland School as a child, was
described as a danger to himself and others and suffering from
``mild mental retardation'' in a mental health report prepared after
an arrest in El Dorado County, Perry said.
   The gunman had a long string of arrests and tried twice to kill
himself while in police custody in El Dorado County in April 1987,
after he and his half-brother were taken into custody for firing at
trees with a semiautomatic pistol, police said.
   Purdy's body was released to his sister Thursday afternoon,
according to San Joaquin County Coroner's Capt. Baxter Dunn.
   At the school, counselors wearing yellow armbands continued their
work trying to minimize the emotional trauma to the youngsters.
   Phitsamay Phenegpahnt, an 8-year-old third-grader, approached the
school with her father, Somsack, and with little enthusiasm.
   ``I scared,'' she said in broken English. ``Man shoot, shoot at
me.''
   But Sophat Sok, 7, and his sister Rothy, a fourth-grader, said
they weren't scared to go back to school ``because the man is dead.''

   President Fidel Castro said Pope John Paul II
is welcome to make the first-ever papal visit to Cuba, the official
Cuban news service reported.
   ``If he decides to visit Cuba on some future date, he will be
received with hospitality and respect, and for my part, it
personally will be a pleasure to talk with him about important world
events,'' Castro was quoted as saying.
   The Prensa Latina report, monitored in Mexico City on Thursday,
quoted Castro as saying that ``there would be no obstacle on the
part of the Cuban government'' if the pope wanted to visit Cuba,
which is considered the least religious country in Latin America.
   ``The pope is appreciated in our country not only by Catholic
believers, but also by the rest of the population, as a high-profile
and influential international leader,'' the news service quoted
Castro as saying.
   Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, a top Vatican official, met with the
Communist leader during a Dec. 22-Jan. 2 visit to Cuba.
   Etchegaray said last week that no date had been yet set for a
papal visit.

   A Cambodian refugee who had lost contact
with his wife and child spotted his little boy's picture on
television as one of the children killed in a schoolyard shooting
rampage, a TV station reported.
   Kim Ly settled in Columbus, Ohio, after being separated from his
wife and young child, Rathanan, during the Khmer Rouge takeover of
Cambodia a decade ago, KCRA-TV in Sacramento reported Thursday.
   He was watching a news report in Ohio about the massacre at
Cleveland School Tuesday morning in which five children and the
gunman were killed and 30 others, including one teacher, were
injured, when he spotted the picture of a 9-year-old victim he
recognized as his lost son.
   Ly, remarried with a 2-year-old son, flew alone to Stockton on
Thursday where he was reunited with his former wife, In Or, the
station said. A Buddhist ceremony was performed at Or's home.
   When asked about the reunion and about learning that he had two
families, a distraught Ly said, ``Yes, but it's too late.''
   The dead boy's aunt, Peou Bou, who attended the memorial service
and reunion, told the station that Or's family would take Ly back as
a brother, not a husband, to avoid disrupting his new life.
   Ly, who escaped to Thailand before settling in Ohio, said by the
time he heard that his family had escaped Cambodia he had already
remarried.

   Two Virginia Military Institute cadets who
admitted taking part in an armored car robbery will never be allowed
to return to the college, where even lying is punishable by
expulsion, a spokesman said.
   ``Right now, they're simply on administrative leave,'' VMI
spokesman Tom Joynes said Thursday. ``In all probability, they'll
resign. If they came back, they would be dismissed by the Honor
Court.''
   The 150-year-old college, reknowned for its strict discipline,
convenes an Honor Court that has just one sanction _ expulsion _ for
any student found to have lied, cheated or stolen.
   The students, William T. Jasinski and Bryan Smals, told a federal
magistrate Wednesday night they had been involved in a $4.5 million
armored car heist orchestrated by Jasinski's father.
   The father, Robert Jasinski, of Boonton, N.J., also was arrested.
He posted $400,000 bond Thursday in New Jersey by putting up his
$900,000 house as collateral.
   The younger Jasinski, 22, also of Boonton, and Smals, 21, of
Columbus, Ohio, were being held in the Roanoke city jail while
awaiting their appearance today before U.S. Magistrate Glen Conrad,
officials said.
   News of the arrests shocked some cadets on the VMI campus lined
with aging cannons and statues of military heroes. Those who knew
the pair described them as quiet students who worked out with
weights and appeared to be good cadets.
   ``For the most part, everyone's shocked,'' said Gray Riddick, a
junior. ``I knew one of them (Smals) personally. He didn't seem like
a person who would be a robber. I'd say he's kind of quiet, but he
seemed nice. He just seemed normal to me.''
   ``I knew Jasinski quite well,'' said David Martin, a senior. ``He
was a model student. His appearance was excellent. He was one of the
friendliest guys you'd ever meet.''
   Neither student was involved much in extracurricular affairs,
Joynes said.
   Smals was a good student, a sophomore studying English on a Navy
scholarship, he said. He characterized Jasinski as a C-student who
was a fifth-year senior studying mechanical engineering.
   Joynes said that about four or five of the school's 1,300 male
students are thrown out for honor code violations each year. Most
are caught lying about such things as where they were at a certain
time, he said.
   ``Stealing is rare,'' Joynes said. ``I doubt we've had one of
those in 10 years.''
   At a snack bar on campus, a dollar bill was tacked to a bulletin
board. Snack bar workers said cadets who find money misplaced in the
dining area always put it up on the board for its rightful owner.

   Faulty brakes and reckless driving caused a
tractor-trailer to go out of control on a steep city hill and strike
five vehicles, killing three people and injuring three others,
authorities said.
   The driver of the 18-wheel rig, Mark Duncan, 27, of Clay City,
Ind., was charged with three counts of vehicular homicide after the
Thursday afternoon accident at a congested state Route 51
intersection near downtown Pittsburgh.
   He also was charged with reckless driving, driving too fast for
conditions and running a red light.
   District Justice Eugene Raible ordered Duncan held at Allegheny
County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bond.
   City and state officials were to continue examining the truck
today to determine whether its air brake system had leaks and
whether the tanker, carrying 6,000 gallons of recycled oil, was
overloaded.
   The truck's brakes, which investigators found were oil-soaked,
failed as it descended Mount Washington, causing it to strike two
vans, a pickup truck and a car before turning over onto another car.
The pickup's driver _ Gary Grimm, 29, of Pittsburgh _ died at Mercy
Hospital about an hour later, the Allegheny County Coroner's Office
said.
   Two men in the flattened car, James Nash, 70, and James Krigger,
62, both of suburban McCandless Township, were declared dead at the
scene after emergency crews worked nearly five hours to free them
from the vehicle, the coroner's office said.

<TEXT>
   An Iranian spiritual leader called for an
end to battles in Lebanon between rival Shiite Moslem militiamen
backed by Iran and Syria, saying the fighting is sinful, Iran's
official news agency said today.
   The call from the Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, designated
successor to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, came as
police said the rival militias skirmished briefly in south Beirut's
slums, wounding three people.
   The Syrian-backed Amal militia and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, clashed with rocket-propelled grenades and machine
guns for two hours Thursday night in the Haret Hreik, Bourj
el-Barajneh and Hajjaj districts, police said.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 168 killed and 318
wounded since Dec. 31, when the two militias began fighting in
Beirut and southern Lebanon.
   The two factions have been locked in a power struggle for control
of Lebanon's 1 million Shiites, the country's largest single sect,
since April. More than 500 people have been killed and 1,500 wounded
in that period.
   Montazeri said the Lebanese clashes ``are clearly haram (sin) and
against divine Sharia (Islamic law),'' according to Islamic Republic
News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Montazeri said it was ``logically and religiously incumbent on
any faction and power that believes in Islam and jihad (holy war) in
the path of God to try to put out the flame of this bloody
fighting.''
   Most of the casualties since Dec. 31 have been in southern
Lebanon near Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone,'' a strip of
land north of the border. Israel established the zone in 1985 after
withdrawing the bulk of its troops from Lebanon following a
three-year invasion.

suffocating the workers, said Tom Lukins, regional administrator for
the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.
   The workers, whose names had not been released, apparently died
instantly, police said.
   The men were welding in the tunnel when the conveyor belt, which
carried material out of the tunnel, stopped running and ``the rocks
slid and buried them,'' said Assistant Fire Chief Al Sigwart.
   A worker discovered the accident about 10 minutes after it
happened, police said. Quarry workers then used a giant crane to
unearth the bodies.
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating the accident. The quarry's owner, Gallagher &amp; Burk
Inc. of Oakland, declined to comment Thursday.

   The Communist Party daily Pravda today paid tribute
to Ronald Reagan, saying he conducted the presidency _ his ``best
role'' _ with a mixture of ideology and realism that led to
substantive improvements in Soviet-U.S. relations.
   Correspondent Gennady Vasiliev wrote that the man who in 1983
called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire'' was, ``according to all
external indications, leaving office as a completely successful
political figure.''
   Pravda's article provided graphic evidence of the changes that
have taken place in the Soviet Union's official view of Reagan, as
his administration and the Kremlin under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev moved toward arms control agreements and a lessening of
tensions.
   Vasiliev wrote that Reagan had not managed to reduce the size of
government, that he increased the federal deficit and spent more
than $2 trillion on the military while failing to gain military
superiority over the Soviet Union.
   But he credited Reagan with lowering inflation and unemployment
and setting the United States on one of its most prolonged periods
of economic growth.
   One paradoxes of the Reagan administration was improved relations
with the Soviet Union despite the president's tough anti-communist
stand, Pravda said.
   As Reagan's term progressed, ``It became all the more clear that
Reagan was somewhat more of a realist than could be judged from his
speeches, especially of the first years of his presidency,'' the
article said.
   Reagan gradually replaced the ideologues he brought with him to
Washington in 1981 with pragmatists, including Secretary of State
George Shultz, it said.
   Reagan and Shultz ``showed realism, the ability to reject
habitual stereotypes in the name of movement toward agreement,'' it
said.
   Reagan, Vasiliev wrote, ``according to the general view, was not
distinguished by the strong intellect of Roosevelt, the broad
education of Kennedy, or even Carter's capacity for work.''
   But his opponents time and again underestimated him, and Reagan
was leaving office a popular and successful president, he wrote.
   During his years as an actor, Reagan did not get many leading
roles and often played the second or third part in his movies,
Vasiliev said.
   However, ``he got the country's leading political role. And now,
summing up the results of his eight-year presidency, I would like to
ask: Wasn't this Ronald Reagan's best role?''

<HEAD>Court Orders Hearing On Evidence In Teacher Murder Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court is questioning
evidence in the murders of a schoolteacher and her two children
which turned up during the trial of her principal but was withheld
until two years after his conviction.
   The court on Thursday ordered Dauphin County Court here to hold a
hearing on the evidence involving former Principal Jay C. Smith, who
faces the electric chair for the 1979 slayings of teacher Susan
Reinert and her two children.
   The highly publicized case inspired the best-seller ``Echoes in
the Darkness'' and a television miniseries of the same name.
   ``Now we have an opportunity, in court, under oath, to find out
what the history is of this thing,'' said Smith's attorney, William
Costopoulos. ``This opens the door.''
   Costopoulos said the handling of the evidence represented a
coverup and asked the court to overturn the conviction on the basis
of prosecutorial miconduct.
   Prosecutors allege the material was planted by someone who wanted
to help Smith.
   In its 8-1 vote, the Supreme Court ordered the county court to
try to determine whether the evidence was real, how it got into a
State Police evidence drawer, whether it was withheld and whether
Smith received a fair trial because he wasn't told about it.
   The evidence consists of two adhesive strips containing quartz
particles reportedly removed from Mrs. Reinert's feet during an
autopsy.
   The attorney general's office said the evidence was found in the
State Police drawer during the last week of Smith's 1986 trial. But
Smith and Costopoulos weren't told about it until last summer.
   Smith claims the evidence was withheld because it would have
supported his contention that Mrs. Reinert was slain at the New
Jersey shore by another teacher who was her lover, William Bradfield.
   Quartz is found in beach sand, and its presence on the body could
indicate she had been at the shore the weekend she died.
   Bradfield was also convicted of the murders. He is serving a life
prison term.
   Besides the court's investigation, State Police and Dauphin
County District Attorney Richard Lewis are investigating the origins
of the adhesive strips.
   Still pending before the Supreme Court is an appeal of Smith's
conviction on other grounds.
   Mrs. Reinert, a teacher at Merion High School outside
Philadelphia, was found in the trunk of her car in the parking lot
of a suburban Harrisburg hotel. The bodies of her children _ Karen,
11, and Michael, 10 _ were never found.

<HEAD>Energy Department Gives Permission To Restart Plutonium Processing
Operations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 1-2 to remove garble. Minor editing throughout.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main plutonium-handling operation at the
troubled Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant will be restarted in
stages within 45 days, the Department of Energy announced.
   The federal agency on Thursday gave Rockwell International, which
operates the government, permission for the restart, officials said.
   Approval came after department officials verified that the agency
and Rockwell had complied with a schedule for improvements of
equipment and procedures.
   Building 771, which was shut down last fall after three people
were exposed to plutonium, is the main structure for processing the
plutonium used to manufacture triggers for nuclear weapons at the
plant near here.
   Two Rockwell employees and an Energy Department inspector
inadvertently walked into a restricted area in the building where
the potential for airborne radioactive contamination existed Sept.
29. The building was shut down Oct. 8 for an investigation and
improvements, officials said, although the actual exposure for the
trio was below federal limits.
   The restart will occur over the next 30 to 45 days, the
department said.
   While the building was shut down, the Energy Department conducted
a semiannual inventory of nuclear materials and reviewed
contamination controls, monitoring programs and work practices, and
46 other actions were taken to improve safety and operations.
   ``We used that time very constructively to fix a lot of things,
to clean the building, lower background (radiation) levels,''
Rockwell spokesman Dennis Hurtt said.
   Bruce Twining of the Energy Department said the federal agency
and private contractor learned a lot from the episode, and it will
``enable us to make continuous progress in the future on
environmental, safety and health issues, as well as maintain our
production commitments.''
   Plutonium, a poisonous and highly radioactive artificially formed
substance, is used in the triggers of nuclear weapons. It is
fissionable and has a half-life of 24,000 years, which means it
loses one-half its radioactivity in 240 centuries.
   The plutonium processing and trigger assembly are done at Rocky
Flats, but the assembly of the actual nuclear bombs is done
elsewhere in the nation's nuclear weapons complex. Other parts of
the system, including the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C., and
the Feed Materials Production Center, have experienced environmental
or safety problems.
   Rocky Flats was targeted by a recent congressional study for
eventual shutdown, with transfer of its operations elsewhere.
Officials say if that does occur, it would take many years to
accomplish and then clean up the site.

<HEAD>Vietnam Says Talks Constructive, Foreign Ministers To Meet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam said today that talks with China on peace
in war-torn Cambodia occurred in a ``friendly atmosphere,'' and
announced the foreign ministers of the two countries would meet soon.
   A Vietnamese spokesman said First Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh
Nho Liem returned to Vietnam today after five days of negotiations
in Beijing.
   The visit, which both sides initially tried to keep secret, was
the first of a high-ranking Vietnamese official to China in nine
years.
   Liem discussed Vietnam's 10-year occupation of Cambodia with
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Vice Foreign Minister Liu
Shuqing.
   They also discussed ``normalization of relations between the two
countries and other issues of concern,'' said a statement from a
Vietnamese spokesman. Relations between the two socialist countries
have been hostile since Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to
drive the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge from power.
   ``The exchange of views between the two sides was useful and took
place in a frank and friendly atmosphere,'' the Vietnamese spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The two sides reached a
number of agreements. The remaining questions will be discussed
later.''
   The statement said Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
will be meeting soon with Qian. It did not give a specific date.
   The Vietnamese Embassy refused to elaborate on what agreements
had been reached, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to
comment on the alleged meeting and results of the talks.
   The Vietnamese spokesman said China and Vietnam discussed ``the
international aspects'' of the conflict in Cambodia.
   China has previously said it would not begin talks with Vietnam
until Hanoi moves to end its occupation of Cambodia.
   But last week, a top Cambodian resistance official said China, at
the request of the Soviet Union, had agreed to talk to Vietnam on
the condition that Moscow opens direct talks with Cambodian
resistance leader Grince Norodom Sihanouk.
   In the 1960s and mid-70s, China provided major assistance for
North Vietnam's war against the United States and South Vietnam.
   But China's relations with Vietnam have been cold since late 1978
when Vietnam toppled the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The ultra-radical
Khmer Rouge had ruled Cambodia since 1975 in a bloody reign that
left at least one million dead.
   Beijing attacked Vietnam in early 1979 to ``punish'' it for its
invasion of Cambodia. Talks between the two countries were cut off
in December 1979.
   Beijing now arms guerrillas opposing Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia. One of the guerrilla groups is the Khmer Rouge.
   On Jan. 7, China said a Vietnamese proposal to withdraw all of
its troops from Cambodia by September was a ``step forward.''
Previously Vietnam, facing serious economic problems at home, had
set a target of 1990 for leaving Cambodia.
   But Vietnam still insists on measures to prevent the Khmer Rouge
from returning to power. Chinahhas refused to exclude the Khmer
Rouge from a future Cambodian government but has said it is willing
to reduce its assistance to the Khmer Rouge and other guerrillas
forces as Vietnam pulls out.
   Vietnam claims it has made partial troop withdrawals each year
since 1982. But China says Vietnam actually has only rotated forces
in and out.
   Vietnam says it has about 50,000 troops in Cambodia. Western
diplomats in Beijing say the actual number is far larger.

   Scores of people marched through one
of the most polluted towns in Yugoslavia to protest a lack of clean
air, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   The protesters in the town of Zenica carried banners saying, ``We
want clean air'' and ``We have enough of lead and sulfur.''
   Zenica, the site of a major iron and steel works, is 50 miles
northwest of Sarajevo, the central Yugoslav capital of
Bosnia-Herzegovina republic, where a fine orange layer of dust
covers the grass and orange clouds form above belching furnaces.
   Tanjug said the protest Thursday was led by employees of the
Regional Institute for Health Protection and joined by scores of
town residents.
   Earlier in the day, the town council declared a second-degree
alert, which calls for the maximum possible production cuts in the
steelworks, the closest possible control on emission of noxious
gases and reinforcement of medical teams in hospitals.
   The more moderate first-degree alert has been in effect since
November 10.

   Pro-government newspapers suggested the
opposition looted a Red Cross warehouse to discredit the leftist
government, and one paper said the CIA and an opposition newspaper
invented the story.
   Managua Red Cross Director Omar Cruz said scores of people who
broke in through the warehouse roof Tuesday took clothing and food
donated for victimsof a hurricane that lashed the Atlantic coast in
October.
   Cruz told The Associated Press, which photographed the incident,
that he did not know what the stolen items were worth.
   The official party newspaper Barricada asked Wednesday if the
looting was the work of ``criminal elements or if it was calculated
with political intentions.''
   The pro-government El Nuevo Diario went even further in an
editorial Wednesday, suggesting the CIA and the opposition newspaper
La Prensa had invented the story to discredit the ruling Sandinista
party.
   La Prensa said the intruders were Nicaraguans made desperate by
the severe economic crisis. ``We're hungry, we have no clothing. The
Sandinistas are at fault for all of this,'' La Prensa quoted a
looter as saying Tuesday.
   Nicaragua suffered more than 20,000 percent inflation last year.
The government has devalued the currency several times and raised
fuel and tranport prices in attempt to repair the battered economy.
   The leftist government says Hurricane Joan worsened an economic
crisis brought on by eight years of civil war with the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   Hurricane Joan slammed into the country on Oct. 21, 1988, killing
100 people and leaving estimated 200,000 homeless. Property damage
was estimated at more than $700 million.

   Police have asked Interpol to help locate 13
suspected members of a Japanese terrorist group in an effort to
prevent terrorist acts from disrupting Emperor Hirohito's funeral,
news reports said today.
   A list of the 13 suspects of the Red Army group was sent Thursday
to each of the 147 member countries of the Paris-based International
Criminal Police Organization, the reports said.
   Officials from the National Police Agency and the Justice
Ministry said the authorities have taken ``various kinds of
measures'' to hunt members of the Red Army, but he refused to
comment further.
   In April, Japanese police asked Interpol to provide information
regarding 26 suspected Japanese Red Army members implicated in
various terrorist acts.
   The Red Army, formed in the late 1960s, advocates ``simultaneous
world revolution.'' It had an estimated 300 members at one point.
The group is believed to be responsible for hijacking a Japan Air
Lines jet to North Korea in 1970 and another JAL plane to Saudi
Arabia in 1977.
   The nationwide newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, quoting unidentified
police and security authories, said the latest police action was
taken to contain the ``moves of the Japan Red Army'' prior to next
month's planned funeral of the late Emperor Hirohito, who died Jan.
7 of cancer at age 87.
   Police fear the Red Army may attack Japanese embassies abroad or
disrupt the emperor's funeral in an effort to gain the release of
Osamu Maruoka and Hiroshi Sensui, both suspected Red Army members
detained in a Japanese prison.
   Hirohito's funeral will be held in Tokyo on Feb. 24, with
hundreds of foreign dignitaries from more than 100 countries
attending. George Bush plans to attend in his first foreign trip as
president.
   After Hirohito's death, the Red Army sent a written statement to
an international news agency in Beirut claiming it would fight ``to
crush the emperor system,'' according to Japanese news reports.

   At least one in five American men has had one
or more homosexual experiences, and at least 3.3 percent have such
sexual contacts regularly, a National Research Council study says.
   Published today in the magazine Science, the study suggests that
the number of American men who have had at least one homosexual
experience is lower than the estimates compiled some 40 years ago by
famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.
   But Charles F. Turner, an NRC scientist and co-author of the new
study, said the current estimates are the lowest possible numbers.
He said there are still not enough data to establish a true number,
which in all likelihood would be higher.
   ``All of the estimates that we have made are lower-bound
estimates,'' Turner said Thursday in a telephone interview. ``These
numbers are best treated as a minimum. We're not saying what the
true number is, but only that this is the best that can be done in
terms of setting a lower bound.''
   He said the uncertainty is the result of the assumed tendency of
surveyed men to be untruthful about homosexual experiences.
   ``Because of what we know about the history of societal
oppression of gay men, there is very considerable reason to believe
that a number of men will conceal experiences that they have had,''
Turner said.
   He said more research is needed, in part to assess the progress
of the epidemic of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
Homosexual males are a major risk group for the fatal disease. An
NRC study on this issue will be released next month, said Turner,
who is director for the NRC Committee on AIDS Research.
   Estimates in the current study include:
   _A minimum of 20.3 percent of American males who were 21 years or
older in 1970 had a same-gender sex experience to orgasm at some
point in their lives.
   _A minimum of 6.7 percent had such sexual experiences after the
age of 20.
   _In frequency of such experiences after the age of 20, the study
estimated a minimum percentage of 1.8 for ``rarely;'' 1.9 for
``occasionally;'' and 1.4 percent for ``fairly often.'' This puts a
total of 3.3 percent in the two most frequent categories of contact.
   Turner said one problem with trying to determine the number of
homosexual men in society is defining precisely what a gay man is.
Many more men have had a single homosexual encounter than are
habitually and preferentially homosexual, he said.
   Kinsey, who conducted sex research from 1938 to 1949, recognized
the problem of defining homosexuality and developed a six-point
scale based on the frequency of homosexual contacts. The Kinsey
study found that at least 37 percent of the population have had some
homosexual experience, and that at least 10 percent of the male
population was ``more or less exclusively homosexual'' for three
years between the ages 16 to 55.
   Turner said the new study ``cannot be simplistically compared''
to the Kinsey studies.
   He said a population analysis also suggests that the 3.3 percent
of adult male population with the most frequent homosexual contact
could not be ``exclusively homosexual,'' a term used by Kinsey.
   ``Most of the men included in our 3.3 percent estimate could not
be classified as exclusively homosexual throughout their lives
because a large percentage of them were married'' at some point in
their life, Turner said.
   The new estimates are derived from an analysis of data collected
from 3,018 adults in 1970 by the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research
in Indiana, along with some data from a 1988 survey by the National
Opinion Research Center.
   Co-authors on the report with Turner were Robert E. Fay, an NRC
consultant; Albert D. Klassen of the University of North Dakota; and
John H. Gagnon of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

Technology, said Thursday that the number of aftershocks was ``not
terribly unusual.''
   Many aftershocks were too small to measure, said Cal Tech
seismologist Lucile Jones, but two of the larger ones Thursday
afternoon were strong enough to be felt in several areas, including
downtown Los Angeles.
   The two shocks, one at 2:02 p.m. and the other at 2:09 p.m.
tentatively measured 3.7 and 3.5 on the Richter scale of ground
motion and were the largest, Daily said. The main quake Wednesday
measured 5.0 on the Richter scale.
   There has been a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes in
Southern California during the past few months, but one expert said
that was no cause for alarm.
   Douglas Givens of the U.S. Geological Survey said about 60 quakes
per month _ about triple the average _ have struck the area since
September, most of them too small to feel.
   ``It's very difficult to say whether this particular increase is
significant or not,'' Givens said. ``From a statistical point of
view, a good bet would mean that a significant event would not
follow.''
   Wednesday's quake, centered eight miles off the Malibu coast in
Santa Monica Bay, caused five minor injuries and briefly knocked out
power to 100,000 people.
   It was the third quake in less than three months to strike the
Los Angeles area with more than a 4.0-magnitude. A quake in
Huntington Beach measured 4.7 in November. A Pasadena-centered quake
in December also measured 5.0.
   The strongest recent shaker was the deadly Whittier Narrows quake
of Oct. 1, 1987, which measured 5.9 on the Richter scale. That quake
and its 5.3-magnitude aftershock on Oct. 4 killed eight people,
injured more than 200 and caused $358 million in damage.

   John Shad, the U.S. ambassador to
the Netherlands, has resigned to return to the private sector after
several years of government service, the U.S. Embassy said today.
   The announcement followed last week's confirmation by the Wall
Street merchant banking group of Drexel Burnham Lambert that it had
offered 65-year-old Shad a job as its new chairman.
   An embassy spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
refused to confirm that Shad was joining the New York firm, but he
said Shad was planning to return to the United States on Feb. 23.
   Shad's stint as U.S. ambassador began in June, 1987, after he
resigned as chairman of the Securities and Exchange commission.
   In line with State Department custom, Shad officially resigned to
President Reagan today, the last day of the administration, the
embassy spokesman said.
   A successor to Shad will be nominated in the next few months by
President George Bush.

<HEAD>Type B Pinpointed As This Winter's Biggest Flu Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children have borne the brunt of the 1988-89
influenza season so far, but federal flu-watchers say it's too early
to tell what the impact will be on older people, for whom the
illness can be dangerous.
   ``Type B'' influenza, one of the three major families of flu
viruses, has now been reported in 23 states, from California to New
York, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   ``Influenza B has predominated ... with most reported illnesses
occurring among children,'' the Atlanta-based agency said in its
weekly report.
   Elderly people and those with certain medical problems are most
likely to suffer serious complications and even death from flu.
``The impact that this year's influenza B activity will have on
older persons and persons at high risk ... is unknown,'' the CDC
said.
   However, each Type B flu epidemic since 1979 has caused higher
than expected levels of death, the report noted. ``Thus, efforts to
immunize high-risk persons in all age groups should continue even as
outbreaks begin.''
   Of the laboratory-confirmed flu cases reported to the CDC this
winter, 81 percent have been Type B flu. And four full-blown flu
outbreaks have so far been linked to Type B, in elementary schools
in Ohio, Nebraska, California and the state of Washington.
   In contrast, the two other major types, which researchers know as
A-H1N1 and A-H3N2, have been reported in 11 and four states,
respectively, with only one outbreak between them _ an A-H1N1
outbreak at a college in Wisconsin last month.
   The recommended U.S. flu vaccine for the winter of 1988-89
contains protection against all three major flu types _ specifically
against a Type B strain known as the Victoria flu, Type A-H3N2
Sichuan flu and Type A-H1N1 Taiwan flu. Those were seen late last
winter and were considered by health officials to be most likely to
spread this winter.
   CDC researchers don't yet know specifically what kind of Type B
flu is hitting the United States this winter, said Dr. Robert
Cannon, a CDC flu specialist.
   Since it is hitting hard among children, ``we assume that it's
closely related enough (to a strain from recent winters) that older
adults have seen it before,'' and therefore may have some immunity
to it, he said.
   The 23 states which have so far reported Type B flu to the CDC
are: New York, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia,
Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Iowa,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Nebraska, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Idaho,
Washington, Oregon and California.

<HEAD>Forest Fire Policy Defended By Top Yellowstone Scientist And Others</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire damage at Yellowstone National Park
last summer was not as bad as most people think, the park's chief
scientist said in a defense of the ``let it burn'' policy.
   ``The long-term effects will favor not only existing wildlife,
but wildlife diversity,'' John Varley said Thursday as the American
Association for the Advancement of Science ended its annual meeting.
   Varley and other researchers said last summer's conflagration was
part of a natural cycle and caused less damage than many people
believed.
   ``We expect to see regeneration beginning next spring,'' and
vegetation will flourish in three to five years, he said. Wildlife
losses were light, Varley added, and included only 250 of 32,000
summering elk and nine of 2,700 bison.
   ``People grew up with Smokey Bear and Bambi and believe all fire
is bad,'' Varley said. ``But there is recognition among the agencies
and scientific community that fire is as important as soil, sunlight
and water in maintaining our favorite park landscapes.''
   Biologist William Romme of Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colo.,
reconstructed a history of fires since 1685 in a large part of the
park and concluded the 1988 blazes ``were a nearly natural event in
the ecological history of Yellowstone.''
   Since the National Park Service abandoned total fire suppression
in 1976, it combats human-caused fires but only those lightning
blazes that threaten human life, homes and villages, special natural
features or threatened or endangered species.
   Varney said he favored continuation of that policy, as well as
setting small intentional, or ``prescribed,'' fires to prevent fuel
buildup near park entrances and villages.
   Varley said the fires that raged for two months last summer
affected 1.38 million acres, or 11.5 percent, of the 12-million-acre
Yellowstone ecosystem, which includes surrounding national forest
land.
   Of the 2.2-million-acre park itself, flames affected 995,000
acres, or 46 percent, he said.
   The perception that half of Yellowstone was devastated ``is far
from the truth,'' Varley said.
   ``Soil scientists and plant ecologists tell us well over 99
percent of the fires burned to only light or moderate intensity,''
damaging the uppermost inch of soil and leaving roots and bulbs
unharmed, he said.

   The father-in-law of Fire Chief Ray Alfred,
whose department's ambulance service has been plagued by problems,
died after a call for emergency medical aid apparently was not
followed up, officials say.
   John Patterson was pronounced dead Thursday after arriving at
Greater Southeast Community Hospital in full cardiac arrest.
   Officials with the District of Columbia's fire and ambulance
services said an unidentified relative drove Patterson about five
blocks from this home to a fire station, where an ambulance crew
provided first aid.
   Officials said a preliminary investigation indicated that a call
was made from the Patterson home to the 911 emergency number seeking
help. However, they said, medical technicians were not aware of the
emergency until the relative asked for help in person.
   The district's fire department has been plagued in recent years
by problems involving ambulance service, including slow response
times, dispatching errors and poor training.
   Following repeated problems, the ambulance service was removed
from fire department administrative control last February, although
it still relies on the department's communications center and other
facilities. Alfred became fire chief in December.

<HEAD>Bush Becomes 41st President, Reagan Heads to California Retirement</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Weather pleasant for inaugural day; updates and edits. First

<TEXT>
   George Herbert Walker Bush, inaugurated in a
noontime transfer of power, becomes 41st president of the United
States today, promising ``our best days are yet to come'' as he
crowns a government career more than two decades long.
   Yielding office after two terms, Ronald Wilson Reagan, 77, a
onetime Hollywood actor and later the consummate Republican
conservative, returns this afternoon to California. Stepping up from
the vice presidency is Bush, 64, born to wealth and privilege, a
decorated Navy combat pilot in World War II, Yale man, Phi Beta
Kappa, Texas oilman and millionaire, congressman, U.N. ambassador,
GOP chairman, envoy to China, CIA director.
   Bush previewed his inaugural address for several reporters,
saying, ``It will be just a broad appeal to the American people to
pitch in and help. It'll be an expression of satisfaction about how
far we've come as a nation, and a recognition that we've got a long
way to go.''
   He said that in the first days of his administration, he would
order a sweeping review of U.S. relations with the Soviet Union
while making the federal budget deficit his top priority at home. He
will meet Tuesday with leaders from Congress.
   Organizers distributed 140,000 tickets to the inaugural ceremony
at the West Front of the Capitol, and extraordinary security was in
place. The day dawned pleasant, with some wisps of clouds.
Temperatures were in the 40s, nothing like the conditions that froze
out Reagan's 1984 inaugural parade.
   In a handwritten note, Bush scripted his day: Up at 6 a.m. to
watch news shows and drink coffee, ``play with grandkids, pray, go
to White House, go to Capitol Hill, get sworn in.''
   The rest of his day looked like this: lunch at the Capitol, the
inaugural parade and 11 invitation-only inaugural balls.
   For the first time, people standing closest to the inaugural
platform _ nearly a third of the crowd _ had to pass through metal
detectors. So did everyone within a two-block area near the White
House.
   In a nod to history, inaugural organizers borrowed for Bush the
Bible used for George Washington's swearing-in 200 years ago. It was
loaned by a Masons lodge in New York. A Bush family Bible also was
on hand.
   A simple 35-word oath written into the Constitution marked the
beginning of the Bush presidency:
   ``I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute
the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best
of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the
United States.''
   Bush's public day began at St. John's Episcopal Church, across
Lafayette Park from the White House. From there, the Bushes were
heading to the White House for coffee with Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, along with Dan Quayle, Bush's vice president, and his wife,
Marilyn.
   An armored limousine was reserved to take the Bushes and the
Reagans to Capitol Hill. To keep the limelight on Bush, Reagan
planned no public remarks.
   Immediately after the swearing-in, the Reagans were boarding a
helicopter at the Capitol for the brief hop to Andrews Air Force
Base, where his Air Force plane was waiting to whisk them back to
Los Angeles and a home bought for them by friends.

   A man was charged with stealing a forklift
after leading police on one of the slowest chases on record.
   ``I guess you could say we had a high-speed chase at seven miles
per hour,'' said police Lt. Ronald Waugaman.
   Clinton J. Gandy, 48, of Greensburg, allegedly hopped on the 1981
Caterpillar tow motor Thursday afternoon, turned the keys that had
been left in the ignition and drove off.
   An employee of Overly Manufacturing Co., which owns the vehicle,
called police, and a cruiser with flashing lights and a blaring
siren caught up with the crawling Caterpillar.
   ``When he saw the car, he just turned around, smiled, waved and
kept on going,'' Waugaman said.
   Gandy finally pulled over and was arrested. He was arraigned on
charges of theft, receiving stolen property and drunken driving.
District Justice Michael Moschetti committed Gandy to the
Westmoreland County Detention Center in lieu of $10,000 bond.

   Israeli authorities closed all 1,200 schools in
the West Bank today in a move to halt growing protests in the
occupied territory, where two suspected collaborators reportedly
were shot to death.
   The indefinite suspension of classes for 300,000 Palestinian
youngsters came little more than a month after schools were reopened
after a 10-month closure, also aimed at halting the Palestinian
uprising.
   After schools began reopening in December, Israeli authorities
warned they would be shut again if they became staging areas for
anti-Israeli protests. In the past week, 89 schools were ordered
closed for limited periods.
   A spokesman for the military government of the West Bank said
government officials met with parents, students and local leaders in
the past few days to warn them that continued violence would lead to
another blanket closure.
   ``The closure is to prevent clashes and minimize the number of
casualties among students,'' the spokeswoman said, reading from a
statement.
   Palestinian human rights groups have contended that school
closures are illegal under local and international law, including
the 1949 Geneva Convention, which protects civilians under military
occupation.
   In the West Bank, merchants shuttered their shops for a third
straight day today to protest an upsurge in Palestinian deaths
blamed on tougher army policies that allow troops to open fire more
freely.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, detailing some of the new
regulations, said troops now are allowed to fire plastic bullets at
Palestinians erecting roadblocks or fleeing a protest, Israel radio
said.
   Rabin also outlined a peace plan that proposes elections and some
form of autonomy for the occupied lands in exchange for a cease-fire
in the 13-month Palestinian uprising.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that the proposal
reflected Rabin's personal opinion and not government policy. ``The
government peace plan is still being prepared,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip today, two Palestinian teen-agers were
reported wounded by gunfire in the Jabaliya refugee camp.
   The army said it was checking the reported injuries. It confirmed
the death of a suspected collaborator in the West Bank village of
Atil and said it was checking whether a second alleged collaborator
died of earlier injuries.
   The victim in Atil, Ahmed Jeredat, 36, was killed Thursday night
when he was shot in the eye, Arab reporters said. They said soldiers
immediately imposed a curfew on the village.
   Jeredat owned a store that sold forms to the military government
that Palestinians need to travel overseas.
   After the slaying, troops raided Atil and ordered males ages 12
to 40 to report to the village school for questioning, the reports
said. Three residents were arrested.
   A second suspected collaborator, Mohammed Irut, 18, died today at
Ramallah Hospital, hospital officials said. Irut was shot in the
head Jan. 12 in the West Bank city of Nablus.
   More than a dozen Palestinians suspected of cooperating with
Israel have been killed since December 1987. Such attacks have been
ordered in leaflets distributed by pro-PLO uprising leaders.
   Since the uprising began, 365 Palestinians have been killed in
the uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have died in the unrest.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government workers armed with electric cattle
prods and tear gas beat and shocked members of the official
Communist Youth League who were holding a special street sale of
scarce items, it was alleged today.
   News of the incident in the city of Chengdu first appeared in an
article today in the official China Youth News.
   A league official, Yang Ling, told The Associated Press by
telephone from Chengdu that one of the victims had an electric prod
applied to his head and cannot speak clearly or raise one arm.
   Ms. Yang said the attack occurred Dec. 30 and led to a sit-in
demonstration by youth league members at Chengdu city offices.
   Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province.
   The China Youth News story was unusual because Chinese papers
rarely run in-depth accounts of official brutality. An article
earlier this week in the People's Daily acknowledged that torture
and forced confessions do occur, but, unlike today's report, it gave
no details.
   The article was an indication China is facing serious problems of
public order resulting from its current economic difficulties.
   A price reform program, along with official corruption, has
resulted in China's highest inflation since the communist revolution
in 1949. Inflation was officially 19 percent last year, but its
actual level could be twice that.
   The league has demanded legal action be taken against the
government workers who allegedly participated in the attack. The
case is under investigation.
   The China Youth News article said officials from a city
inspection team responsible for overseeing economic activity in
Chengdu joined in the attack.
   The report, based on six eyewitness accounts, said 40 members of
the team, wielding electric prods, handcuffs and tear gas, burst
into the crowd shortly after 11 a.m. and stopped a special sale of
300 hard-to-get products, including poultry, fish, soy sauce and
spirits.
   The sale was organized by the Youth League of the Chinese
Communist Party. League members in the city's Commerce Department
informed the city government of the sale but had yet to receive
permission to put it on, the report said.
   Ms. Yang said league members had assumed the government would
approve the sale since it was designed to help the people.
   According to the report, soon after the sale began the inspection
bureau ordered it halted.
   Members of the inspection team arrived on the scene and
``violently suppressed the sale,'' the paper said.
   Four league members were arrested. They were released later that
day after a high-ranking Communist Party official intervened, the
report said.

   A black man who said he moved to
this quiet suburban area looking for a safer home vowed not to be
frightened away by the burning 8-foot cross he awoke to find in his
front yard.
   ``I'm not a runner, I'm a fighter,'' said Derrick Quals, 31.
   Sympathetic neighbors visited Quals following the cross-burning
early Thursday in the predominantly white Los Angeles suburb about
35 miles northwest of downtown.
   Quals, who owns a chain of liquor stores, said he discovered the
flaming cross about 2 a.m.
   ``I said to myself, `This can't be California,''' Quals said.
   He said he hasn't received any threatening letters or telephone
calls.
   No arrests were made in the case.
   ``We don't have anything at this point,'' said county Sheriff's
Lt. Harvey Cantor.
   Quals said he moved from the San Fernando Valley community of
Sepulveda into his $500,000 home because his old neighborhood was
deteriorating.
   ``We wanted to move someplace that was safer,'' said Quals, who
lives with his wife and two children.

   If those holding nine Americans hostage in
Lebanon ever want to send a signal to the U.S. government, ``this is
an opportunity. Let those people go,'' a former captive said eight
years to the day after he was released by Iran.
   ``The release of those hostages would be a magnificent signal,
would be something that I think would trigger all manner of things
here in this new administration,'' said L. Bruce Laingen, who was in
charge of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran when it was stormed on Nov. 3,
1979.
   Laingen recalled during an interview on ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' the release of himself and 51 other American hostages on
Ronald Reagan's inauguration day in 1980 after 444 days of captivity.
   But, he said, ``today is not the day to remember us. It's a day
to remember nine Americans who are denied their freedom in Beirut.''
   He noted that Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, has been a captive almost four years, ``far
longer than any of us.'' He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   ``And I would say this morning to those who hold them and to
those governments who can influence them, if they ever wanted to
send a signal to this government at a time of change in the Middle
East, this is an opportunity. Let those people go.''
   Laingen said incoming President Bush ``is not going to make
concessions to terrorists. But George Bush, like all of us today, I
think, are open to change in the Middle East.''
   President Reagan said Thursday he was frustrated over his
inability to free the American hostages. ``We don't know where they
are,'' he said, but officials were continuing to explore ``quietly
and privately'' how to win their freedom.

   Beatrice Lillie, who was billed as ``the funniest
woman in the world'' during a long theatrical career in Britain and
the United States, died today at her home in Henley-on-Thames, her
conservator said. She was 94.
   ``She just went this morning, peacefully, at 8:47 a.m.,'' said
John Phillip Huck, who said he had been associated with the actress
for 40 years and was appointed her conservator in 1977.
   Miss Lillie was a master of elegant double entendres and sharp
ripostes delivered with a flourish of an enormously long
cigarette-holder. She was, in the title of her 1973 autobiography,
``Every Other Inch a Lady.''
   Beatrice Gladys Lillie was born May 29, 1894 in Toronto.
   She first appeared on a British stage in 1914 and made her
American debut in 1924 in a review produced by Andre Charlot. From
1952 to 1956, she toured in a one-woman act, ``An Evening with
Beatrice Lillie,'' which won a Tony Award in 1953.
   Her film credits including ``Exit Smiling'' in 1927, ``Around the
World in Eighty Days'' in 1956 and ``Thoroughly Modern Millie'' in
1967.
   Miss Lillie, formally known as Lady Peel, left no direct
survivors, Huck said. A funeral service was tentatively planned for
Jan. 30 at St. Margaret's Church in Harpsden, near her home in
Oxfordshire.

   The giant cake that Air Force stewards served
George P. Shultz on his last official flight bore the message
stenciled in ice cream: ``Thanks For The Memory.''
   Over 6{ years of traveling 880,941 miles with the secretary of
state to 74 countries, stewards, staff and the regulars in the press
corps came to know him a little bit better than most people.
   They will retain memorable experiences of visits to the Kremlin,
to the Taj Mahal, the holy city of Jerusalem, the colorful capital
of Soviet Georgia, Tbilisi.
   They found him to be a cautious man, but not without emotion. He
made himself accessible to the media on almost every flight, and
broke precedent by putting his remarks on the record.
   They saw Shultz fail to entice Palestinian Arabs into
negotiations with Israel, or even to talk to him. A memorable
portrait was Shultz standing alone in a moonlit courtyard in East
Jerusalem, waiting in vain for a dozen Palestinians who dared not
risk the disfavor of the Palestine Liberation Organization by
accepting his invitiation.
   Shultz was willing to risk being stood up, in public, in the
interest of promoting Mideast peace talks. It was a risk of
embarrassment that not many secretaries of state would have taken.
   Shultz made five trips to the Middle East in 1988 alone, each
time warning Israel and the Arabs that the status quo was dangerous.
Each time he was rebuffed, but his spirits were not dampened. ``I
think there is a lot of possibility there, and to a certain extent,
the groundwork is work that we did,'' he said on his last trip, to
Vienna, last Sunday.
   Still, Israel remains besieged in a hostile Arab world, while the
West Bank and Gaza seethe with Palestinian unrest. The proliferation
of ballistic missiles in the region and suspicions that Iraq, Libya
and Syria either have or are capable of producing chemical or
biological weapons compound the dangers.
   Shultz had other failures, too. The agreement he worked out with
Lebanon and Israel in 1983 fell apart under Syrian pressure. He
objected to secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in 1985, but was unable
to deter President Reagan and the National Security Council. Some
critics said Shultz did not fight hard enough, especially since the
missile deliveries undercut his campaign against terrorism, or that
he should have resigned in protest when he lost out.
   His successes outnumbered the setbacks, though.
   Despite the Iran-Contra scandal, Shultz managed to carry the
banner against terrorism to new heights, alerting initially bemused
Western leaders to the danger. And he championed human rights.
   Shultz took time on his trips to Moscow to meet with Jews and
other dissidents. He attended a Passover Seder in the U.S. embassy
and saw to it that leading ``refuseniks'' were invited.
   Gradually, under a modern Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the doors swung open. Jewish emigration is at a nine-year high. More
than 600 political prisoners have been released. More than 100
divided families have been permitted to reunite.
   ``I think the things I feel the best about had to do with the
area of human rights,'' Shultz said on the flight to Vienna. ``And
the one incident that always sticks with me is the day I had a phone
call from Ida Nudel, saying `I'm home.' I still tingle a little as I
think about it.''
   The long-time Jewish refusenik was issued an exit permit for
Israel under U.S. pressure, and had called Shultz from Jerusalem
after her arrival.
   Apart from human rights, his most lasting achievement was to
recognize the change in Moscow after Gorbachev's ascent to power in
April 1985 and to play a leading role within the Reagan
administration in responding to Soviet arms control overtures.
   Shultz worked out a close relationship with Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister. In 31 meetings, they made
arrangements for five superpower summit meetings and worked out ways
to reduce regional tensions. The Soviet Red Army is withdrawing from
Afghanistan. Cuban troops are leaving Angola. And the Vietnamese are
pulling out of Cambodia.
   Shultz's impact on U.S. foreign policy depends partly on how much
the Bush administration follows the pattern or changes it. James A.
Baker III, Shultz's designated successor, voiced reservations at his
Senate confirmation hearing to a human rights conference in Moscow
and said negotiations to reduce strategic nuclear weapons would be
delayed ``to review the bidding.''
   But, as President-elect Bush himself has said, ``the genie is out
of the bottle.'' U.S.-Soviet relations are in a new phase. And for
that, Shultz is as responsible as anyone.

<HEAD>Japan Calls for Dialogue With North Korea, Apologizes for `Crimes'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>

   Japan said today it wanted to improve ties with
communist North Korea and apologized for ``past crimes,'' an
allusion to its brutal colonization of the Korean peninsula earlier
this century.
   The comments came on the eve of a visit by a delegation from
North Korea's Communist Party, which was to stay for a week as
guests of the Japan Socialist Party. It will be the first trip to
Japan by a North Korean party delegation.
   Hitoshi Tanaka, director of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's
Northeast Asia Division, extended an offer to open a dialogue with
North Korea on any issue ``with no preconditions whatsover.''
   However, he said it was not certain if a meeting would occur
between government officials and the four-member North Korean
delegation.
   A policy statement released by the Northeast Asia Division also
said: ``The government and people of Japan are profoundly aware that
past actions by Japan have inflicted great suffering on the peoples
of nearby lands.''
   It added, ``We have been pursuing ... peace out of our regret for
what happened and our determination that it shall never happen
again.''
   Japan seized the Korean peninsula in 1910 and occupied it through
World War II. It was divided into the communist North and capitalist
south in 1945.
   The Japanese statement followed a North Korean report Jan. 12
which denounced Japan's attitude toward Pyongyang, the capital of
North Korea, and demanded an apology for ``past crimes.''
   ``Japan has no intention of supporting the perpetuation of
division desired by neither North nor South,'' the Japanese
statement said.
   ``Japan does not maintain hostile policy toward North Korea, and
we recognize that it will be appropriate ... for us to move
positively toward improved relations between Japan and North Korea.''
   North and South Korea have recently exchanged a flurry of
proposals heralding the first major peace offensive aimed at
officially ending four decades of confrontation that included the
1950-53 Korean War.

   A panel broke off the left wing of a Boeing 757
after takeoff, forcing the Eastern Airlines flight to return to
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
   None of the 105 passengers or crew of six was injured, said
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   The plane left Atlanta at 8:04 p.m. Thursday and was near
Birmingham, Ala., en route to Los Angeles, when the pilot noticed
the problem, said Jack Barker, a Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman.
   ``It was climbing at 28,000 feet and the captain felt a shudder
and heard a noise,'' said Matell.
   The Boeing 757 returned to the Atlanta airport an hour later,
Matell said. The passengers all were transferred to another flight.
   Barker said the FAA would investigate the incident, noting that
the loss of the 3-foot-by-5-foot panel was ``something that happens
on rare occasions.''

<HEAD>Israel, Egypt Conclude First Round of Border Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli and Egyptian negotiators are moving
toward an agreement under which Egypt would regain control of the
disputed border strip of Taba, a popular winter resort, officials
said today.
   The Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement the first round
of talks, which concluded today, were ``intensive and
constructive.'' The talks are to resume in the next for days, the
statement said.
   Ministry spokesman Alon Liel told Israel radio an agreement was
emerging in which Israeli tourists would be allowed to visit Taba
without a special permit or entry taxes if the 250-acre strip were
returned to Egyptian sovereignty.
   Israel has controlled the tiny Red Sea resort since the 1967
Middle East war, and an Israeli-owned, $41 million hotel complex
there has become a favorite winter vacation spot.
   Egypt has demanded return of the land, and the dispute has been a
sore point between the nations for the past six years.
   It began when Israel refused to hand over Taba in 1982 when it
left the Sinai peninsula under terms of the U.S.-brokered
Israeli-Egypt peace treaty.
   The issue went to international arbitration, and in September a
five-member panel in Geneva awarded the border pillar closest to the
resort to Egypt. But the tribunal said it had no power to decide the
final border demarcation line.
   The current talks are aimed at defining the border. If Egypt
prevails, the hotel will be in its territory.
   Other issues include entry procedures for Israelis and foreign
tourists, and a plan for Egypt to purchase the hotel.
   Israel has demanded that its citizens have reasonable access to
the site.
   A six-member U.S. team, headed by State Department legal adviser
Abraham Sofaer, has been mediating at the talks.
   Nabil El Arabi, head of the Egyptian delegation, told reporters
on Thursday, ``We would like Israeli tourists to come here, not only
by the tens of thousands but by the tens and hundreds of thousands.''

   President P.W. Botha will need at
least a month to recuperate from a stroke, and doctors are likely to
tell him next week whether he can return to work or should retire,
newspapers reported today.
   Botha on Thursday named Constitutional Development Minister Chris
Heunis, the senior-ranking Cabinet member, as acting president.
   Neither Botha nor other government leaders has indicated how long
Heunis will serve as acting president.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said Botha, 73, would
need at least a month to recuperate. Its report was based on
comments from an unidentified government source and an unidentified
neurosurgeon.
   The Star, the country's largest daily, said without citing
sources that doctors ``will probably decide by next week whether
(Botha) will be fit enough to resume office ... or whether he should
retire.''
   Botha's office did not comment on the reports, but issued a
statement from doctors saying his left arm and leg, which were
weakend by the stroke, had ``improved markedly.''
   The president received several visitors today and was in a
cheerful mood, his office said.
   Botha, in charge of South Africa's government since 1978, has
refused to comment on his possible retirement.
   Heunis and other Cabinet members met today with the Namibian
Cabinet in Cape Town. South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74
years, is to begin implementing independence in the territory in
April, leading to elections in November. Heunis said in a statement
that the talks were ``frank and took place in a spirit of mutual
understanding.''
   He said discussions focused on how the transitional government
will be phased out prior to the elections. The multiracial Cabinet
is made up of Namibians, but they are under Louis Pienaar, a South
African who serves as administrator general.
   Heunis, 61, was acting president for several days last year while
Botha visited Europe.
   If Botha does not resume his duties, the Cabinet would elect a
new president.
   He suffered the stroke at his home Wednesday and was taken to a
military hospital in the Cape Town suburb of Wynberg.
   Doctors said Thursday that his left arm and left leg were
weakened by the stroke, but his facial muscles and speaking ability
were not affected.
   In his Cabinet post, Heunis has been assigned the task of
developing a constitutional format that would give blacks limited
power in the white-run government.
   Most prominent black leaders have refused to negotiate with
Heunis.
   There had been reports in recent months that Botha planned to
replace Heunis because of his inability to persuade black leaders to
participate in negotiations.
   Also, Heunis only barely won re-election to Parliament in 1987
when he was challenged by Denis Worrall, who quit as South Africa's
ambassador to Britain to run as an independent.
   Those mentioned as presidential contenders include Foreign
Minister Pik Botha, who is not related to the president; National
Education Minister F.W. de Klerk; and Defense Minister Magnus Malan.
   As prime minister and later as president, Botha pushed through
the first significant racial reforms undertaken during the National
Party's 40-year rule, such as legalization of black trade unions and
abolition of pass laws that restricted blacks' movements.
   But he has refused to discuss the possibility of a one-person,
one-vote system in South Africa, where the 5 million whites control
the government and economy, and the 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.

   A man was arrested at the scene of an
arson fire that killed his wife and two sons, authorities said today.
   John R. Milo, 45, the husband and father of the victims, was
arrested Thursday night and held on an arson charge, West Barnstable
District Fire Chief John P. Jenkins said. He was scheduled to be
arraigned today, but police were unsure what other charges would be
brought.
   Geraldine Milo, 45, Andrew, 12, and Christopher, 9, were
pronounced dead on arrival at Cape Cod Hospital in nearby Hyannis,
Jenkins said.
   Milo was outside the two-story, wood frame house when
firefighters arrived at the scene, Jenkins said.
   Neither Jenkins nor Barnstable Police Sgt. Bernard Jenkins, who
is unrelated to the fire chief, would say what led police to arrest
Milo so promptly.
   The fire chief declined to say where the victims were found
inside the house. He said it was not immediately determined how the
fire was started.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's farewell from office today produced
celebrations by Nicaragua's Sandinista government, a gift horse from
Canada and thanks from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to a
``true and perfect gentleman.''
   In the Soviet Union, the Communist Party daily Pravda published a
lengthy article titled ``Reagan's Best Role'' that credited Reagan
with becoming more of a realist than an ideologue as his term
progressed.
   Correspondent Gennady Vasiliev noted that Reagan, ``according to
the general view, was not distinguished by the strong intellect of
Roosevelt, the broad education of Kennedy, or even Carter's capacity
for work.''
   But his opponents time and again underestimated him, Vasiliev
said, and Reagan was leaving office a popular and successful
president.
   The Japan Times hailed Reagan as the ``man of the decade,'' and
an Australian newspaper called him ``a hard act to follow.''
   In the Netherlands, the Rotterdam newspaper Algemeen Dagblad said
the United States ``found a much-wanted anchor in Reagan's
straightforwardly conservative ideology of patriotism, military
might and economic recovery.''
   In Managua, however, the leftist Nicaraguan government planned
parties and parades to usher out Reagan, whose administration
financed anti-government rebels since 1981. And in Jordan, PLO
official Khaled al-Hassan called Reagan an ``illiterate'' who knew
nothing about international problems.
   ``The workers will show their ingenuity to mock imperialism and
the reactionaries in this country,'' the state Voice of Nicaragua
said Thursday.
   The Nicaraguan government said it hoped normal relations with the
United States could be restored after George Bush took office.
Al-Hassan agreed, saying, ``Bush knows ... a lot. A knowlegeable man
with consultants is more useful than an illiterate with
consultants.''
   In Yugoslavia, the leading daily Politika said today that
``Reagan will be remembered as an unmatched political seducer''
whose rhetoric Bush will never be able to match.
   West Berlin's mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, sent Reagan a letter of
thanks for his demand that the Berlin Wall be torn down.
   ``Your impressive words during the event of the 750th anniversary
(of Berlin) before the Brandenburg Gate, when you so forcefully
demanded overcoming the division and tearing down the Wall, remain a
special memory for Berliners,'' the letter said.
   While Bush takes over the reins of power, Reagan plans to saddle
a gift from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
   Reagan put the cart before the horse Wednesday when he announced
the gift would be sent to his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.
Canada delayed confirming it until late Thursday _ possibly because
of a U.S. law preventing presidents from accepting gifts while in
office.
   In France, the daily Liberation devoted its entire front page to
a photo, taken from the rear, of Reagan and his wife Nancy riding
off on their horses. ``So long, Reagan,'' read the caption.
   In London, Mrs. Thatcher bestowed verbal bouquets on Reagan in a
note made public one day before Bush's inauguration.
   ``You have been a great president, one of the greatest, because
you stood for all that is best in America,'' she said.
   ``Your beliefs, your convictions, your faith shone through
everything you did. And your unassuming courtesy was the hallmark of
the true and perfect gentleman. You have been an example and an
inspiration to us all.''
   In Sydney, The Daily Telegraph gave Reagan a similar send-off.
   ``His personal optimism ushered in a new era. He gave America a
new sense of dignity and was an effective morale-boosting
cheerleader.
   ``History will be kind to Mr. Reagan ... He will be a hard act to
follow.''
   In Tokyo, the Japan Times said Reagan reigned over a ``fabulously
lucky time'' for the industrialized world.
   The English-language daily also credited Reagan for reviving
``America's morale after the disasters of Watergate, Vietnam, two
oil crises and the humiliation of the Iran hostage affair. ``As a
result, we think that Mr. Reagan should be named `man of the
decade.'''
   Israel and Arab commentators appeared to agree the change was
Israel's loss and the Arabs' gain.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said he believed Bush
``understands the Palestinian problem and has good intentions.''
   The English language Jerusalem Post said Bush, ``has never had an
emotional pro-Israel record like his predecessor, who has spoken of
Israel with great warmth.''
   Pope John Paul II sent his greetings to George Bush and expressed
hopes the new president would spare no efforts in building world
peace.
   ``On the occasion of your inauguration as president of the United
States, I wish to renew my greetings and prayerful best wishes to
you and your family and to all the American people,'' said a
telegram from the Vatican.

<HEAD>Man Kept Locked in Dark Room for 11 Years, Reports Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was kept locked in a dark
room for 11 years, apparently because his mother was worried about
his mental illness and followed the advice of a witch doctor,
newspapers reported today.
   Eric Mokoto, 47, was taken to a hospital in Klerksdorp, 90 miles
southwest of Johannesburg after his sister, Julia Ramonyadiwa,
returned home last weekend and found him alone in the room, The
Sowetan and The Citizen newspapers said.
   Mokoto was described as emaciated, with long hair and
fingernails, and had lost the ability to speak, said people who saw
him in the hospital, The Sowetan reported.
   Mrs. Ramonyadiwa said she had last seen her brother in 1978 when
he was ill after being kicked in the head during a soccer game.
   Mokoto's mother took care of him, but she refused to let other
family members see him when they visited, Mrs. Ramonyadiwa was
quoted as saying.
   ``I was always curious about my brother's health,'' she told The
Sowetan. ``On Sunday morning, I forced open the door of the room. He
was a terrible sight.''
   The Citizen quoted police Lt. Doeds Myburgh as saying the family
held a funeral service 11 years ago, pretending that Mokoto had died.
   Mrs. Ramonyadiwa said she believed her mother kept Mokoto in the
room ``on the advice of a witch doctor with the view to turn my
brother into a zombie.''
   The Sowetan said Mokoto was able to give written responses to
questions.
   ``I don't know why I was kept in the room for so long. I am sick
and it is difficult for me to explain why,'' he wrote, according to
The Sowetan.
   The Sowetan quoted hospital superintendent Dr. Bernard Vos as
saying Mokoto had an unspecified mental problem.

<TEXT>
   The right engine on a Boeing 737 jetliner fell off
shortly after takeoff early today, forcing the plane to return to
O'Hare International Airport, officials said. No injuries were
reported.
   Piedmont Airlines Flight 1480 took off from O'Hare with 27
passengers and five crew members aboard, then returned for an
emergency landing shortly before 8 a.m., said FAA spokesman Mort
Edelstein.
   ``At approximately 1,000 feet, or just moments after takeoff, the
right engine separated from the aircraft and landed on airport
property,'' said Dave Shipley, a spokesman for U.S. Air Inc., which
owns Piedmont.
   The engine from the twin-engine jet fell in a field one-half mile
west of the airport, Edelstein said.
   ``I know of no injuries or fire or ground damage from the
engine,'' FAA spokesman Don Zochert said.
   A witness gave a conflicting report of where the engine fell.
   ``There was a lot of smoke coming out of one engine, and we saw
it leaning, almost falling off, and then it fell off ... it was
about a few hundred feet in the air and landed in a grassy part of
the runway,'' Tom Waldinski, a city of Chicago worker told WBBM
radio.
   Two runways were shut down because of debris from the engine, but
no delays of departing and arriving flights were reported, said a
spokeswoman for the city's Department of Aviation who refused to
give her name.
   The engine was a JT8 turbofan manufactured by Pratt &amp; Whitney,
Zochert said. The engines of a Boeing 737-200 are mounted under each
wing and the airplane is designed to fly on one engine.

   Investigators are focusing on revenge as the
most obvious motive for the stabbing death of Oregon's top prison
official, who was attacked outside his office, authorities said.
   ``His position (as corrections chief) obviously brings forward
revenge as a primary motive,'' Marion County District Attorney Dale
Penn said Thursday.
   Corrections Director Michael Francke, 42, who was found dead
outside his office building early Wednesday, had received death
threats, Penn said.
   ``For anyone who's a prosecutor, a judge or working in
corrections, there are threats,'' Penn said. ``Obviously, that has
to be a priority motive at this time.''
   Francke came to Oregon 19 months ago from New Mexico where he
served as a state district judge, a prosecutor and as head of that
state's corrections department.
   Police also were looking into whether the slaying might be
connected with Francke's work in New Mexico, although Penn said the
focus of the investigation was on Oregon.
   ``We haven't excluded New Mexico, but we have local leads that
are more recent,'' he said, adding that investigators had no
suspects.
   A grid search of the crime scene was conducted Thursday, but
authorities said no significant evidence was found. Plaster casts
were made of a pair of footprints found in a patch of soggy turf in
front of the porch where Francke's body was found.
   Francke apparently stayed after a staff meeting ended Tuesday
evening and was killed sometime before midnight in the parking lot,
Penn said. He apparently tried to re-enter the building to seek help
after being stabbed.

   The PLO today rejected a peace plan proposed
by Israel's defense minister and called on George Bush to curb the
Israeli crackdown on rebellious Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   ``It is the responsibility of the the new U.S. administration to
chain the hands of Israeli leaders so thirsty for bloodshed,'' Ahmed
Abdulrahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's chief
spokesman, said in a statement.
   ``Today, as George Bush assumes his constitutional powers, the

the terrible Zionist crimes against our people.''
   On Thursday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin unveiled a
peace plan that included offering the Palestinians elections in
exchange for ending the 13-month-old uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. A ministry spokesman said the proposal reflected Rabin's
personal opinion and not government policy.
   Abdulrahman said the PLO ``strongly rejects the proposals which
reflect Israeli leaders' insistence on the continuation of the
occupation and violence.
   ``The stones of the urpising have thwarted all the Zionist
schemes, foremost of which is administrative autonomy, and opened
the door wide for a real peace based on a complete Israeli
withdrawal from Palestinian lands and the establishment of an
independent Palestinian state,'' he said.
   ``No to elections under occupation ... No to the settlements. The
Israeli army has no role in the Palestinian land,'' he added.
   Abdulrahman called for an urgent Arab summit meeting to discuss
the ``explosive Middle East situation'' and draw up a joint Arab
security strategy to remind ``the major powers and Europe of their
responsibility to solve the Middle East problem and revive the peace
process.''
   The Rabin proposals were also rejected by the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist-oriented Palestinian
guerrilla group headed by George Habash.
   In a press statement telefaxed to The Associated Press in Cyprus,
the Syrian-based faction said the offer was ``part of Israel's
political maneuverings to abort the uprising after the failure of
the policy of terrorism and suppression.''

<HEAD>Tass Correspondents Get Credentials, But a Little Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington correspondent for the Soviet news
agency Tass said today his office has finally received credentials
to cover the presidential inauguration, but after some of the events
were already over.
   ``I guess you've got silly bureaucrats in your country, as we
have them in ours as well,'' Andrei Fedyashin said in a telephone
interview a few hours before the swearing-in.
   In a story it filed about problems with the inaugural credentials
committee, Tass said its reporters had been refused accreditation
until the last minute.
   A call to the inaugural committee to check on the Soviets'
complaint brought a recording: ``We are closed for the inauguration
of George Herbert Walker Bush but will be open again tomorrow
morning.''
   Another call to the press credentials office brought word from a
secretary that all members of the committee were out on the parade
route.
   The Tass story credited U.S. colleagues in the news media with
convincing the committee to let Tass reporters cover events.
   The story said the correspondents received a postcard Jan. 10
denying them accreditation.
   The report quoted credentials committee member Victoria Scali as
telling the Tass reporters ``it's a cruel world'' and there wasn't
room for more reporters at inaugural events. But the story said
credentials director Jim Moore later issued the press passes and
apologized to Tass correspondents.
   Fedyashin said the Tass Washington bureau has eight
correspondents and received seven credentials. He said it was
sending reporters or photographers to the Capitol for Bush's
swearing-in, to cover the parade and to watch the new president
enter the White House.
   He said, however, that Soviet reporters from the newspapers
Pravda and Izvestia never did get credentials they had requested.

   This riot-weary city kicked off a festive Super Bowl
weekend today, and police said a peaceful professional basketball
game just blocks from the center of the week's violence showed that
calm had been restored.
   Officials reported occasional gunfire and minor rock and bottle
throwing Thursday night, although one gang of a dozen Overtown
youths reportedly beat three people. Twelve riot-related arrests
were made, and police said they have resumed normal patrols.
   ``Everything's quiet,'' police spokesman David Rivero said this
morning. ``We still have the perimeter up, but we're letting
everyone through. The officers are just standing by the
barricades.'' All highway exits into Overtown that had been closed
during the disturbance were open today, he said.
   Thursday night, about 100 officers formed a barrier between the
Overtown area and Miami Arena, where the Chicago Bulls defeated the
hometown Heat in a National Basketball Association game. Some 13,000
fans attended the game, with no reports of trouble. Tuesday night's
game against Phoenix was canceled because of the violence.
   ``The game definitely shows things are under control,'' said
police spokesman Armando Villorin. ``It was a test, and we feel
great about it.''
   ``We're grateful that the focus has returned to the Super Bowl,''
said police spokesman Ray Lang.
   Raymond Scales, a high school counselor at the game, said it took
him only a half-hour to sell 25 T-shirts that read ``I survived
Miami 1989. It was a riot.'' Fans snapped up the shirts at $10
apiece.
   The fire department estimated damage to buildings from three days
of rioting at less than $1 million, although shopkeepers digging out
Thursday said their greatest losses were in inventory and equipment
that was looted or destroyed.
   The rage touched off by a Hispanic police officer's shooting of
an unarmed black motorcyclist Monday left one man dead, seven others
shot and some 370 people jailed _ most of them suspected looters
under 18, police said. More than 100 had criminal records, including
17 murders and 198 drug offenses.
   Some remained in jail pending the posting of bonds, and that
helped maintain the quiet, Miami police Sgt. Michael Mazur said.
   For Miami, Sunday's Super Bowl really begins today with an
onslaught of parties and performances, fireworks and frivolity.
Nearly 75,000 fans are expected at the championship football game
between the Cincinnati Bengals and the San Francisco 49ers.
   Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis Jr., Robin Williams,
Kenny G, Marvin Hamlisch and the Vienna Choir Boys headline the
events. Two huge parties are planned, free to city residents.
   Police continued to control access to the largely black Overtown
area, but within the neighborhood, businesses lifted their shutters,
children attended school and youngsters played pick-up basketball.
   As the dust settled, business owners and a black community
activist said it was clear black-owned businesses were spared and
others were specifically targeted during three nights of rioting.
   The rioters were not just youths running wild in the night but
people who picked their targets carefully, they said, sometimes even
choosing to ransack a store and destroy its cash registers and
scales but leave behind large stocks of beer, wine and food.
   ``Everything was planned and targeted: Protect black businesses
and get the white man, the Hispanic and the Arab out of our
community,'' said black community activist Georgia Ayers.
   ``They were not hungry. They just wanted to destroy,'' said Sam
Bahhur, whose Palestinian family operated seven small food markets
in Overtown and Liberty City. ``We ran away from the uprising back
home in Palestine, now we find this.''
   Marvin Dunn, a psychologist and black activist, said economics
underlie the frustrations that led to the rioting.
   ``I don't see this as white against blacks, blacks against
whites,'' Dunn said. ``What is happening is that a larger and larger
segment of the black community is falling farther and farther behind
the rest of us in income and in the quality of life.''
   Fire Department spokeswoman Christy LeMay said a tally of damage
in Overtown and Liberty City totaled 13 buildings torched, seven of
them abandoned. Ten to 15 cars also were burned, she said.
   The family of Allen Blanchard, 24, one of the two black men
killed in the Monday night incident that set off the rioting, urged
calm for his Saturday burial. Clement Lloyd, 23, the motorcyclist
fatally shot in the head, will be buried Monday.
   An attorney for Officer William Lozano said Lloyd was driving
toward his client on a powerful motorcycle and that the officer shot
in self-defense.
   Miami police, the state attorney's office, the FBI and a special
community panel are investigating the death.

   A predawn arson fire engulfed an East
Side house today, killing six people and injuring two others,
authorities said. Three children were among the dead.
   Four other people escaped without injury as the fire spread
explosively through a 2{-story, wood-frame house, Fire Department
spokesman Harold Knabe said.
   Police Sgt. Greg Mills said the deaths were being investigated as
homicides. No motive has been established.
   The fire was the second major arson fire in the city in less than
two months. Six firefighters were killed Nov. 29 at a construction
site explosion that investigators said was triggered by arson.
   ``Investigators believe something was thrown through a living
room window on the first floor and spread quickly up a stairwell,''
Knabe said of today's fire. The victims were all found on the second
floor of the house. None was immediately identified.
   The two injured people, one of whom jumped from a second-floor
window, were taken to unidentified hospitals.
   Investigators were looking into the possibility that gasoline was
used, Knabe said. Traces of gasoline were found in the living room
and a five-gallon gas can was found on the porch with some residue
inside.
   ``There were reports (from survivors) that something went through
the front window,'' he said. The survivors told authorities that the
house burst into flames suddenly after 3 a.m.
   Authorities said the victims were members of two related
families, and ranged in age from 8 months to 79 years. Knabe said
some of the people in the house were visiting relatives.
   Battalion Fire Chief Bobby Davis said he immediately suspected
arson because ``it (the fire) just took off too quick.'' According
to Knabe, ``every inch of the structure was on fire when firemen
arrived.''
   The fire destroyed about 60 percent of the house but was
prevented from spreading to other structures in the residential
area, Knabe said.

   A railroad worker rescued a woman and
five screaming children from a stalled car seconds before it was
demolished by an Amtrak passenger train.
   ``If those workers hadn't been there, we would have had six dead
people,'' said police officer Richard McMillen.
   Santa Fe Railroad employees Joe Otero, 44, of Anaheim, and
Anthony Morales, 32, of Hesperia, were working nearby when they saw
the car stopped on the tracks at a railroad crossing.
   Otero helped pull the woman and the children, ranging in age from
2 to 8, to safety and he and Morales then comforted them until
rescue personnel arrived.
   The train hit the car just seconds after Otero pulled the last
child to safety, Morales said.
   Lorraine Ruiz, 26, said she was driving her three children and
her sister's two children to school and had begun to cross the
tracks when a crossing gate came down on the trunk of her car.
   ``I thought I'd back up, but I couldn't back up. I had the car in
neutral,'' she said.
   ``She was scared. She was confused. The kids were screaming. And
by that time the train was really coming,'' said Otero, who fell and
suffered a slight shoulder injury.
   ``The railroad's director of safety said it sounds like he
(Otero) would be a good nominee for the Carnegie Medal for
heroism,'' said Mike Martin, Santa Fe's manager of public affairs.
   ``I was just doing what I would hope anyone would do if my family
was in such a situation,'' said Otero, who has eight children.

   Currency traders didn't wait for bankers'
hours to get the business day started here today as the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange launched expanded trading hours with a snowball fight
and some fast deals.
   The exchange introduced its new 4:30 a.m. starting time _ 3{
hours earlier than the previous opening time _ so currency trading
will coincide with morning hours in Europe.
   ``The feeling is if you can make the hours more conducive to the
business day in Europe, more business will emanate from the
Philadelphia exchange,'' said Barry Tague, president of Tague
Securities, the exchange's designated specialist firm in the German
mark and the Japanese yen.
   To draw attention to the new hours, the exchange threw a 4 a.m.
snowball-throwing contest outside the exchange _ no problem even in
a mild winter since artificial snow was brought in.
   The first throw missed the five currency symbols set up under
floodlights as targets on the street, but soon the U.S. dollar
symbol and the British pound fell, and within 15 minutes
participants were choosing each other as targets instead.
   Likewise, things began moving quickly on the trading floor, where
about 100 people were at work, compared with the usual daytime
150-200. With the Paris clock on the wall reading 10:30 and the
London clock 9:30, exchange president Nicholas Giordano rang the
bell to officially open currency trading.
   Within five minutes, a furious auction erupted at one end of the
room, resulting in about 1,200 contracts for German marks _ about
$30 million worth, said Arnold Staloff, president of the
Philadelphia Board of Trade.
   ``It's important because it's important to Europe,'' Staloff said
of the early opening. ``Europe has been asking us to do this.''
   Europeans want the Philadelphia market, he said, because ``it's
the only viable listed market on currency options in the world.''
   The new hours are 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
the latter trading period begun in September 1987 to cover the
Japanese morning hours.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said today the Communist
Party's proposal to legalize Solidarity does not go far enough but
that he is willing to talk with the government if the union's
leadership agrees.
   ``Seeing all the needs and necessities, I will try to do
everything on my side to begin talks about Poland ... as soon as
possible,'' the Solidarity leader said after meeting with workers at
the Gdansk shipyard, where the union was founded in 1980.
   Walesa said at a news conference that he was only expressing his
own opinion and that he would consult with other Solidarity leaders
over the weekend. The trade union will announce its position soon
after that, he said.
   ``I will want to take advantage of all chances for agreement for
Poland because we need it so badly. Time really presses us,'' Walesa
said.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, endorsed the proposal
in Warsaw on Thursday as a ``momentous event'' for the nation.
   He said Solidarity could be legalized if the independent trade
union federation agreed to respect the law.
   The resolution also says new unions must stop accepting financial
support from the West. It does not contain a timetable for
legalization or call on new unions to refrain from striking, but
party leaders have suggested a two-year trial period with no strikes.
   Poles watched Jaruzelski's news conference on television and
could read about the Communist Party proposal in today's newspapers,
which carried the full text of the position paper on political and
trade union freedoms.
   ``One can state _ without any fear of misusing these words _ that
Poland is entering a qualitatively new stage of transformations of
her political system,'' said a commentary in Zycie Warszawy, a
Warsaw daily.
   But Alfred Miodowicz, the head of the official OPZZ trade union
alliance, who voted against the party proposal, said rank-and-file
workers were not prepared for the changes.
   ``The situation is very tense in the country and I think we are
facing very serious events in enterprises,'' he said at a news
conference today. ``Although the intent of this position was to
bring about a peaceful mood in enterprises, it seems to me the
effect could be just the opposite.''
   The Communist Party's Central Committee approved the union
proposal Wednesday in a resolution that said Solidarity could be
legalized so long as it is non-violent, respects the constitution
and the law and helps reform the hard-pressed economy.
   ``Trade unions will be such as the working people want them to
be,'' said the resolution, made public Thursday.
   A subdued Jaruzelski said at a rare news conference in Warsaw
that ``our offer is honest and serious.''
   Asked if he would meet with Walesa, whom he had detained for 11
months after declaring martial law in 1981, Jaruzelski said: ``Never
say never.''
   The dramatic reversal by Jaruzelski and other party leaders
underlined the failure of a seven-year campaign to eradicate the
independent union movement and the personal popularity of Walesa.
   The leadership, shocked by strikes in May and August and
confronted by a worsening public mood, began to view Walesa as a
potential partner in economic and political reforms aimed at
reviving the failing economy.
   At a news conference in Gdansk on Thursday, Walesa said he needed
to examine the party proposal carefully.
   ``I will try to say something, when I see what it's like,''
Walesa said.
   He said that under no conditions would he accept a government
offer that deprives Solidarity of its freedom.
   ``After all the experiences, losses and struggles, we cannot give
up our independence or sovereignty,'' he said.
   ``If we blow it here, other people will have to deal with the
same problem again. I don't want my son or his generation to live
through such things again, where it all accumulates, rots and then
explodes.''
   ``We cannot destroy this chance (by conceding too much), but at
the same time we should not struggle for some ambitious details,''
he said.
   Legalization of Solidarity has become increasingly important
because of the poor economy, Walesa said.
   He also rejected concerns raised by party hardliners who question
whether Solidarity can be trusted to operate peacefully.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Attack Treasury Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas today fired
mortars at the headquarters of the Treasury Police, killing at least
one person. Officials and witnesses said 10 people were wounded,
including two soldiers.
   The attack early this morning was the fourth on a major military
installation in this capital in three months.
   Col. Heriberto Hernandez, commander of the Treasury Police, said
two soldiers were wounded inside the base, on the city's east side.
Two men he described as civilians were badly burned.
   Witnesses nearby said four other civilians were taken away by Red
Cross ambulances. They said another woman was wounded by shrapnel.
   The civilians also said a man was wounded in an exchange of
gunfire before the mortars were launched, apparently when a soldier,
suspecting an attack, tried to detain one of the guerrillas.
   The charred and mutilated body of a man lay about three yards
from the smoldering wreckage of a pickup truck used in the attack.
   Insurgents in recent months have placed homemade mortars in the
beds of pickup trucks and parked the trucks near targeted buildings.
The vehicles explode when the first charge is detonated by remote
control.
   The guerrillas' clandestine Radio Farabundo Marti reported
shortly after the attack that the mortars caused ``extensive
damage'' inside the police headquarters.
   Hernandez showed reporters inside the base small pieces of
shrapnel, presumably from the mortars. He said one soldier was
seriously wounded and the other suffered superficial wounds.
   He said no projectile landed inside the compound. There was no
apparent property damage inside the base.
   A civilian employee of the Treasury Police told reporters the
projectiles exploded in the air. A policeman inside the compound
confirmed that version of events. Neither the civilian employee nor
the policeman would give their names.
   The explosions damaged walls and broke windows of an adjacent
office and a home.
   The Treasury Police was originally formed to prevent production
and sale of homemade liquor and the loss to the treasury, through
unpaid taxes, that moonshine resulted in. But in the past 20 years
it has taken on predominantly military functions and has a special
anti-subversive unit.
   Marxist-led guerrillas are waging a 9-year-old civil war against
the U.S.-backed government. In 1988, they increased attacks on
targets in and around the capital, bringing what had been a mostly
rural war to the city.
   An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
the war.
   The guerrillas staged three similar mortar attacks in November
and December on the National Guard headquarters, the country's main
air force base and the headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   At least seven people, including three civilians, were killed and
more than 60 wounded in the attacks.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors today questioned a doctor about
whether former Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos is too ill to
come to New York for arraignment on charges he stole millions of
dollars from his homeland.
   Prosecutors cross-examined Dr. Martin Cogan, an internist who was
the fourth doctor called as a witness by Marcos lawyers.
   On Thursday, Cogan said ``It would be completely inadvisible''
for Marcos, 71, to travel to New York for arraignment on
racketeering charges.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan conducted the hearing at
defense request to determine when and where Marcos can be arraigned
and if he is physically competent to stand trial on charges he stole
$103 million.
   Thursday's session was interrupted by word from Hawaii that
Marcos _ already hospitalized for pneumonia and bronchial asthma _
had suffered a collapsed left lung.
   Marcos' condition improved from guarded to stable Thursday night,
and hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop said he would remain in the
intensive care unit through today. One of his Honolulu doctors,
Calvin Wong, said earlier that Marcos apparently was out of danger.
   Kop said that during the lung collapse, there were indications
Marcos suffered a heart irregularity.
   At the end of Thursday's court session, Keenan said if reports
from Hawaii were correct, ``There is no way in the world he is going
to be arraigned in a courtroom in the next couple of weeks _ or
maybe months.''
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, have been living in Hawaii since
their ouster in a popular uprising in 1986.
   After his indictment in October, Marcos asked that the
arraignment be moved from New York to Hawaii for health reasons. He
has been hospitalized three times in the last two months, twice for
congestive heart failure.
   At Thursday's hearing, Dr. Robert Eliott, a cardiologist,
testified in support of the defense's contention that the former
president was now too ill to be arraigned anywhere.
   ``He was unable to complete a sentence without stopping and
gasping,'' said the doctor, who went to Hawaii to give Marcos a
stress test. He said Marcos was suffering from heart failure and
kidney problems.
   ``To make a long story short, I felt this was a dying man,'' he
said.
   Dr. Neil Raskin, a San Francisco neurologist, testified that
Marcos suffered severe headaches that caused ``excruciating pain''
when he examined him last month.
   Raskin said that when Marcos' lawyers contacted him in December,
he said he was ``biased'' against Marcos from news reports and
expected to find little or nothing wrong with him.
   But when he examined Marcos Dec. 17, said Raskin, ``to my
surprise, he was looking terrible, looking chronically ill.''
   Prosecutors agreed Wednesday that Marcos was too sick to be moved
to New York, but urged that the arraignment take place in Honolulu.

   As he did during his presidential campaign, Bush made an appeal
in his address for reaching out to the disadvantaged and the
homeless.
   Americans' possessions ``are not the measure of our lives,'' he
said.
   ``My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost
and roaming. There are children who have nothing, no love and no
normalcy. There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement
to whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rules
the slums.''
   ``There is crime to be conquered,'' he added, ``the rough crime
of the streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to
become mothers of children they cannot care for and might not love.
They need our care, our guidance, and education, though we bless
them for chosing life.''
   The new president said he was committed to ``a new activism,
hands-on and involved.''
   Bush also expanded on the ``thousand points of light'' theme he
first sounded in his convention acceptance last August, his way of
referring to aid from organizations and individuals to help the
disadvantaged.
   ``We will work on this in the White House, in the Cabinet
agencies. I will go to the people and programs that are the brighter
points of light, and I will ask every member of my government to
become involved.''
   Bush had said in advance that his inaugural address would be
short on specifics and long on broad themes. And it was.
   He talked in general terms about working with Congress to balance
the federal budget and called for a new harmony that he said should
replace ``a chorus of discordant voices'' on budget issues.
   Bush said he was extending his hand of friendship to the two
leaders of the Democratic-controlled Congress: Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine and House Speaker Jim Wright of
Texas.
   ``We can't turn back clocks, and I don't want to. But when our
fathers were young, Mr. Speaker, our differences ended at the
water's edge,'' Bush said, urging a return to bipartisanship in the
conduct of foreign policy.

   Actor Griffin O'Neal was ordered today to
serve 2{ weeks in jail for violating community service provisions of
his probation for the boating death of a friend.
   O'Neal, 24, of Los Angeles, served only 60 of the 400 hours
ordered in 1987 when he was sentenced in the 1986 Memorial Day
boating death of Gian-Carlo Coppola, 23, son of Hollywood director
Francis Ford Coppola. O'Neal was acquitted of manslaughter in the
case but convicted of reckless boating.
   ``I was found in violation, which was true,'' O'Neal told
reporters immediately after being sentenced to 18 days in the county
jail, beginning at noon today.
   ``I'm here to pay my dues, and I'm willing to do it,'' he said.
O'Neal admitted he was scared to go to jail, then added: ``But I
think I'm going to be O.K.''
   Anne Arundel County Circuit Court Judge Martin A. Wolff said he
was giving O'Neal credit for completing a boating safety video,
answering questions at a telephone hotline, paying a fine and
completing some of the required public service work.
   However, he did not agree with defense lawyer T. Joseph Touhey's
explanation that O'Neal failed to complete his public service work
at the San Fernando Volunteer Center, 25 miles from his house,
because his driver's license was suspended and he had no car.
   Touhey disputed the public perception that O'Neal, son of
Hollywood actor Ryan O'Neal, lived a life of privilege. Instead, he
stressed that his client was financially independent and struggling
to stay employed.
   ``Life has not been as grand for him in spite of what people
think,'' Touhey argued. ``His name has become synonymous with this
case. ... It has colored every aspect of his life.''
   Touhey said O'Neal has had trouble getting acting roles, and
instead has worked part-time as a painter, gardener, and laundry
delivery man while auditioning for minor acting parts.
   Wolff, who originally had sentenced O'Neal to a 30-day suspended
sentence, suggested O'Neal might have served his 400 hours by simply
working Saturday or Sunday afternoons without interfering with his
employment.
   ``It would not have been a terrible imposition,'' he said.

   The little girl Joel Steinberg allegedly beat to
death left behind enough circumstantial evidence to convict him of
murder, a prosecutor told a jury in closing arguments today.
   The only witness to the crime, which shocked New Yorkers and
reverberated across the country, was the victim, 6-year-old Lisa
Steinberg, said Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro.
   ``Although you never heard her voice, you never heard her speak
one word, she was the most powerful witness in this courtroom,''
Casolaro said.
   ``From her grave, she delivered circumstantial evidence which you
should use to convict her murderer, the man she believed was her
father, Joel Steinberg,'' Casolaro said. ``That evidence, and that
evidence alone, is sufficient for you to reach a verdict.''
   Casolaro recalled that witnesses for the prosecution as well as
the defense had agreed the child was the victim of a homicide. Even
a defense witness agreed that Lisa might have survived if she had
been brought to a hospital sooner.
   On Thursday, lawyers summed up the defense by accusing
Steinberg's former companion, Hedda Nussbaum, of killing their
illegally adopted daughter because she was jealous of the attention
he gave the girl.
   The 47-year-old disbarred lawyer has been accused by Ms. Nussbaum
of fatally beating Lisa in November 1987.
   ``Hedda has thus far escaped punishment for murdering Lisa,''
defense attorney Ira London said in summation Thursday. ``She was
also granted an opportunity to get revenge against Joel by being
appointed his accuser.''
   The prosecution says Steinberg hit the girl, then acted
``recklessly'' and showed ``depraved indifference'' to her life by
letting her lie unconscious for 12 hours in the apartment without
seeking help for her.
   Jurors should begin deliberating by Monday in the trial that has
become a national symbol of child abuse issues.
   Steinberg denies he ever hit the child and defense lawyers
maintain Ms. Nussbaum did.
   ``Hedda caused the injuries to Lisa,'' London said. ``She did it
herself in a fight.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, her face disfigured from beatings allegedly
inflicted by Steinberg, was arrested with Steinberg, but charges
against her were dropped and she became the prosecution's star
witness.
   Another defense lawyer, Adrian DiLuzio, called Ms. Nussbaum ``a
poor excuse for a woman and a mother.''
   ``She didn't care about the kid a bit, not one bit,'' DiLuzio
said. ``Lisa Steinberg was a rival. Lisa got all the attention she
(Ms. Nussbaum) thought she should have been getting.''
   DiLuzio recalled testimony that Nussbaum thought Steinberg was a
``god.''
   ``If someone's stealing your god, you kill them, and you kill
them without remorse, vindictively,'' he said, ``nor would you ever
have a sense of guilt about what you did.''
   Specifically, DiLuzio said that when Steinberg went out to dinner
with a friend about 7 p.m. on Nov. 1, 1987, ``Lisa was alive, she
was alive and she was well. While he was out, Hedda Nussbaum had a
fight. That could only have been a fight between Hedda and Lisa.''
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, had testified that she never left the house
after Lisa fell unconscious that night. DiLuzio reminded the jury
that two police officers testified they found Ms. Nussbaum in a car
about 8:30 that night, drinking beer.
   For the past year, Ms. Nussbaum has been in a psychiatric
hospital.
   ``She has escaped prosecution by hiding in mental institutions
for the past year,'' London said. He said she was ``packaged like a
cosmetic product'' to win jury sympathy and avoid prosecution.
   ``She is a woman who lied to keep her freedom,'' London said,
citing testimony by psychiatrists who said she did not have
emotional problems that warranted hospitalization.
   London also pointed to Ms. Nussbaum's agreement with the district
attorney's office granting her immunity from prosecution in return
for her testimony against Steinberg.

   President Reagan pardoned New York Yankees
owner George Steinbrenner for his violation of election law during
the 1972 re-election campaign of Richard Nixon, while two other
well-known people were still waiting to hear about the status of
their pardon pleas.
   A senior administration official said Thursday that Reagan
approved the pardon of Steinbrenner and nine other men. The Justice
Department had recommended the pardons and Reagan gave his OK
earlier this week.
   But the official would not say precisely whether any more pardons
would be forthcoming today as Reagan's two-term presidency ends and
he gives way to successor George Bush.
   Among those with pardons pending are industrialist Armand Hammer
and newspaper heiress Patty Hearst Shaw. It could not immediately be
determined whether the Justice Department's pardons office had made
recommendations to Reagan on their applications.
   Under normal procedures, a pardon request is sent to the pardons
office, reviewed and then sent to the White House with
recommendations. Reagan has granted relatively few pardons, with no
more than 350 approved in his eight years in the office.
   None of the nine other men receiving pardons this week was
well-known. They had served time or paid fines for a variety of
offenses ranging from income tax evasion and possession of stolen
firearms to concealment of non tax-paid whiskey.
   Steinbrenner pleaded guilty in 1974 to charges of violating the
federal election laws. He had been accused of conspiring to violate
the laws in connection with corporate campaign contributions.
   Steinbrenner also had been charged with trying to ``influence and
intimidate'' employees of his shipbuilding company into lying to a
grand jury. The questions were raised about the nature of a $100,000
contribution to Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign.
   The contributions were made through the American Shipbuilding
Co., a Cleveland-based firm in which Steinbrenner is chief executive
officer. On Nov. 27, 1974, Steinbrenner was suspended by
then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn from active management of the team for
two years. Kuhn reinstated him 15 months later.
   Steinbrenner paid a $15,000 fine, but served no time.
   Steinbrenner was not available for comment, said Harvey Green, a
spokesman for the Yankees.
   In a New York Times interview in early 1988, Steinbrenner said,
``I feel badly about it. It was just one of those unfortunate
things.'' Steinbrenner said he was willing to bear responsibility
for the crimes but said they happened because he didn't understand
what the campaign finance act required of him.
   Patricia Hearst Shaw, now living in Connecticut with her husband,
Bernard, and two daughters, was sentenced to seven years in federal
prison for her role in an armed robbery in San Francisco in 1974.
She claimed she had been brainwashed by the radical Symbionese
Liberation Army after she was kidnaped by members of that group. She
was released from prison after serving only 23 months, as her
sentence commuted by then-President Carter.
   Hammer's pardon plea has been pending for some time. The top
executive of Occidental Petroleum had pleaded guilty in 1975 to
concealing more than $50,000 in contributions to Nixon's 1972
re-election campaign.
   Pardons do not cleanse the record of the convicted person,
although a pardon does restore a person's full citizenship rights,
such as voting.
   In addition to Steinbrenner, Reagan awarded pardons to:
   _Frederick Stiles, sentenced in 1978 to four years' probation and
a $500 fine, for illegal transfer of machine guns in Texas.
   _Oliver Swanier, sentenced in 1969 to four years' probation and
paid a $500 fine for violations of laws regarding possession and
concealment of whisky for which no tax had been paid in Mississippi.
   _James Windsor, sentenced in 1977 to six months in jail and three
years' parole for possession with intent to distribute cocaine in
New Mexico.
   _Jerry Hooker, got three years' probation and paid a $200 fine on
a 1971 sentence for a federal firearms violation in North Carolina.
   _William Long, got five years' probation on a 1978 sentence for
illegal possession and receipt of firearms from a convicted felon in
South Carolina.
   _George Panske, sentenced in 1972 to two years' probation for
receiving stolen property in Massachusetts.
   _Wilbur Pleets, sentenced in 1981, got 10 days in jail, three
years' probation and was ordered to perform 400 hours of community
serfice for making fraudulent claims to the federal government in
North Dakota.
   _Ralph Thompson, got two years' probation and paid a $1,000 on a
1981 sentence for copyright infringement in Texas.
   _Oda Worley, sentenced in 1972, received three years' probation
and paid a $6,000 fine for attempted federal income tax evasion,
falsifying income tax returns and aiding in preparation of falsified
tax returns in Oklahoma.

   Entertainer George Burns decided to
donate $1 million to a hospital endowment fund to celebrate his 93rd
birthday today, his manager said.
   Burns is topping off the pot for a $90 million fund drive for
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center that he began with a $1 million donation
on his 90th birthday, manager Irving Fein said.
   ``As of today they've got $89 million ... so he's giving them the
extra million as a birthday gift to them,'' Fein said.
   Burns, author of the best-selling novel ``Gracie: A Love Story,''
about his late wife Gracie Allen, planned to formally announce the
gift to reporters later in the day.
   Born Nathan Birnbaum on Jan. 20, 1896, in New York, Burns began
in vaudeville and then became a comedian, performing in radio and
movies, most recently in the title role of the ``Oh, God'' series of
films.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said today the Communist
Party's proposal to legalize Solidarity does not go far enough but
that he is willing to talk with the government if the union's
leadership agrees.
   ``Seeing all the needs and necessities, I will try to do
everything on my side to begin talks about Poland ... as soon as
possible,'' the Solidarity leader said after meeting with workers at
the Gdansk shipyard, where the union was founded in 1980.
   Walesa said at a news conference that he was only expressing his
own opinion and that he would consult with other Solidarity leaders
over the weekend. The trade union will announce its position soon
after that, he said.
   ``I will want to take advantage of all chances for agreement for
Poland because we need it so badly. Time really presses us,'' Walesa
said.
   Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, endorsed the proposal
in Warsaw on Thursday as a ``momentous event'' for the nation.
   He said Solidarity could be legalized if the independent trade
union federation agreed to respect the law.
   The resolution also says new unions must stop accepting financial
support from the West. It does not contain a timetable for
legalization or call on new unions to refrain from striking, but
party leaders have suggested a two-year trial period with no strikes.
   Poles watched Jaruzelski's news conference on television and
could read about the Communist Party proposal in today's newspapers,
which carried the full text of the position paper on political and
trade union freedoms.
   ``One can state _ without any fear of misusing these words _ that
Poland is entering a qualitatively new stage of transformations of
her political system,'' said a commentary in Zycie Warszawy, a
Warsaw daily.
   But Alfred Miodowicz, the head of the official OPZZ trade union
alliance, who voted against the party proposal, said rank-and-file
workers were not prepared for the changes.
   ``The situation is very tense in the country and I think we are
facing very serious events in enterprises,'' he said at a news
conference today. ``Although the intent of this position was to
bring about a peaceful mood in enterprises, it seems to me the
effect could be just the opposite.''
   The Communist Party's Central Committee approved the union
proposal Wednesday in a resolution that said Solidarity could be
legalized so long as it is non-violent, respects the constitution
and the law and helps reform the hard-pressed economy.
   ``Trade unions will be such as the working people want them to
be,'' said the resolution, made public Thursday.
   A subdued Jaruzelski said at a rare news conference in Warsaw
that ``our offer is honest and serious.''
   Asked if he would meet with Walesa, whom he had detained for 11
months after declaring martial law in 1981, Jaruzelski said: ``Never
say never.''
   The dramatic reversal by Jaruzelski and other party leaders
underlined the failure of a seven-year campaign to eradicate the
independent union movement and the personal popularity of Walesa.
   The leadership, shocked by strikes in May and August and
confronted by a worsening public mood, began to view Walesa as a
potential partner in economic and political reforms aimed at
reviving the failing economy.
   At a news conference in Gdansk on Thursday, Walesa said he needed
to examine the party proposal carefully.
   ``I will try to say something, when I see what it's like,''
Walesa said.
   He said that under no conditions would he accept a government
offer that deprives Solidarity of its freedom.
   ``After all the experiences, losses and struggles, we cannot give
up our independence or sovereignty,'' he said.
   ``If we blow it here, other people will have to deal with the
same problem again. I don't want my son or his generation to live
through such things again, where it all accumulates, rots and then
explodes.''
   ``We cannot destroy this chance (by conceding too much), but at
the same time we should not struggle for some ambitious details,''
he said.
   Legalization of Solidarity has become increasingly important
because of the poor economy, Walesa said.
   He also rejected concerns raised by party hardliners who question
whether Solidarity can be trusted to operate peacefully.

<TEXT>
   Sixty-one moose have died in Alaska so
far this winter in the uneven contest between animal and locomotive.
   Moose kill figures are kept from November to April, when deep
snow drives the huge animals from their summer range in the
mountains down toward the path of least resistance _ firm footing on
or near the cleared railroad tracks.
   A total of 329 moose were killed on railroad tracks during that
five-month period last year, said Alaska Railroad spokeswoman Vivian
Hamilton.
   Mortality is particularly high on a 53-mile stretch of rails
between Houston and Talkeetna.
   The railroad and the state Department of Fish and Game conducted
an eight-day experiment in that area last year to see if moose
mortality could be reduced.
   All the $11,000 study proved was that a slow train can kill a
moose as surely as a fast one. The two locomotives assigned to the
experiment struck 15 moose while traveling 49 mph and 14 animals
while traveling 25 mph, officials said.
   ``We're not slowing down this year but we are plowing in those
areas,'' Hamilton said Thursday. ``We use wing plows and cut a swath
of 18 to 20 feet on either side of the rails. We don't need that
kind of distance to run trains.''
   The railroad tries to recover what meat it can after collisions
with the wandering moose, she said. The railroad works with state
Fish and Wildlife Protection officers, who maintain a list of people
who need the meat.
   ``We notify them (state), tell them its location and then bring
it (carcass) to the nearest road crossing,'' she said. ``If you're
on the list, you go and retrieve it.''

   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, elevated to
that post in 1986, got his first opportunity today to administer the
presidential oath of office with the swearing-in of George Bush.
   Rehnquist presided at the noontime swearing-in ceremony as Bush
succeeded Ronald Reagan as president.
   Rehnquist was a Supreme Court associate justice when Reagan
promoted him to succeed Warren E. Burger, who twice administered the
oath of office to Reagan.
   Dan Quayle was sworn in as vice president minutes earlier by his
own choice, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   The Constitution _ Article II, Section 1 to be precise _ spells
out the exact oath the president must take. Nothing in the
Constitution specifies what oath the vice president takes, or who
should administer the oaths.
   It has been the American tradition for chief justices to swear in
new presidents since John Jay was asked to swear in George
Washington to a second term.
   Actually, Jay said he was unable to attend and sent William
Cushing, the Supreme Court's senior associate justice to administer
the oath in 1793.
   Subsequent chief justices have not missed presiding over
inauguration ceremonies, except when a president's sudden death
required emergency swearings-in.
   Most recently, Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in by U.S. District
Judge Sarah Hughes aboard Air Force One hours after John F. Kennedy
was assassinated.

   George Bush, assuming office as the nation's
41st president with a rare mandate for continuity, sought today to
establish himself as a leader ready to take a peaceful and
prosperous nation into ``the age of the offered hand.''
   The new president's speech contrasted sharply with the sense of
urgency heard so often from the steps of the Capitol on Inauguration
Day.
   As the first sitting vice president to win the White House in 152
years, Bush took office by turning to Ronald Reagan and saying:
   ``President Reagan, on behalf of your nation, I thank you for
thwe wonderful things you have done for America.''
   No one doubted it was a heartfelt tribute to his predecessor.
   In this nation with its historic tradition of orderly transfer of
power, the new often take office with kind words for the old.
   Eight years ago, in his inaugural remarks, Reagan turned to
Democrat Jimmy Carter to thank him for ``your gracious cooperation
in this transition process.''
   Four years before that, Carter had thanked Gerald R. Ford ``for
all he has done to heal our land.''
   But those kind remarks were only polite prelude to citing the
troubles the new president believed he was inheriting.
   Taking office in the depths of the Depression, Franklin D.
Roosevelt took office and told a troubled nation that ``the only we
have to fear is fear itself.'' A generation later, John F. Kennedy
warned of the dangers at home and abroad and urged Americans ``ask
not what your country can do for you _ ask what you can do for your
country.''
   Richard M. Nixon took office 20 years ago and described a nation
``caught in war, wanting peace ... torn by division, wanting unity.''
   Reagan was in that tradition eight years ago when he told the
nation in the opening moments of his inaugural address: ``These
United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great
proportions.''
   Reagan went on to catalogue the ``human misery and personal
indignity'' caused by rising unemployment in the steel and auto
industries. His speech was filled with references to ``economic
ills'' and ``this present crisis.''
   The tone was unmistakable and it was grim.
   ``Government is not the solution to our problem; government is
the problem,'' said the conservative Republican president, a deeply
held belief that was the basis of an eight-year guerrilla war
between Reagan and the bureaucracy.
   To emphasize the urgency of the crisis he believed confronted the
nation, Reagan went from the inaugural platform to the President's
Room of the Capitol where he fulfilled a campaign pledge by signing
an executive order declaring a freeze on hiring of federal civilian
employees.
   For Bush, who has served in a long list of federal appointive
posts, government was not the enemy _ even as he chose to suggest
there was a better solution for many of the nation's problems.
   The new president's ``thousand points of light'' theme by which
he refers to private efforts help people was central to his
inaugural address today.
   He described a nation ``rich with promise. We live in a peaceful
and prosperous time.'' Then, he added, ``But we can make it better.''
   He sought to set a moral tone that would depart from the
materialism of the past eight years.
   ``We are not the sum of our possessions,'' Bush told a nation so
often witness to an administration of glitter and designer gowns.
   The new president, taking office at a time when homelessness is
recognized as a national problem, called for a``a new engagement in
the lives of others'' and called for greater cooperation within
often-conflicting branches of government.
   ``This is the age of the offered hand,'' he concluded, a
sentiment he no doubt hoped would be a hallmark of his
administration.

   Pravda said he had picked up the six-foot stick as a precaution

wolf with his lasso after using the stick to kill two others.
   Pravda did not say when the attack occurred.

   Dan Quayle was sworn in today as the 44th vice

from a little-known Midwestern senator to the second highest
official in the land.
   Quayle, who became a lightning rod for critics of George Bush
during the presidential campaign, was administered the oath of
office by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   His wife, Marilyn, held the Bible and their three children,
Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne, 9, looked on.
   It was the reward for what Quayle has described as ``a baptism by
fire'' in a campaign dogged by questions about his experience,
qualifications, military service and academic record.
   His swearing-in preceeded by minutes the oath-taking by Bush, the
man who thrust Quayle into the national spotlight by picking the
junior senator from Indiana as his running mate.
   In the traditional oath, Quayle, 41, promised to ``support and
defend the Constitution of the United States'' and to ``bear true
faith and allegiance to the same.''
   Before the Capitol ceremony, Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, were
invited to the White House by President Reagan for morning coffee
with Bush and his wife, Barbara.
   Quayle celebrated into the night Thursday, attending the Indiana
Society Ball with fellow Hoosiers, the Inaugural Gala and other
parties honoring the new president and vice president.
   Noting that he had resigned the Senate seat from Indiana earlier
this month to assume the vice presidency, Quayle quipped, ``My
mother and father will be happy to know that I'm gainfully employed
once again.''
   He greeted 13,000 or more supporters and described them as ``our
best friends'' as they filled the lobby of one of the Smithsonian
Institution's museums for the Vice President's Reception in the
afternoon.
   Quayle borrowed a line from Winston Churchill in a brief
reference to the controversy over his experience, military record
and other matters that surrounded his selection to the Republican
presidential ticket last August.
   ``Winston Churchill once said that there's nothing more
exhilarating than to be shot at without result,'' Quayle said. He
added later that the quotation was ``rather appropriate to my
particular case.''
   Quayle repeated his remarks to each wave of guests, who crowded
into the vice presidential reception in groups of 2,000 or so. The
guests each paid $20 to attend and received a commemorative
medallion etched with Quayle's picture.
   ``Here we are, ready to go, to do the work that you and the
people of America said they wanted us to do,'' Quayle said.
   ``George Bush is ready. I'm ready. Now let's get to work,'' he
said.
   Quayle stopped at a downtown fast-food restaurant for breakfast
on the day before becoming vice president. He later spoke to 8,000
high school students from around the nation who gathered at an
inaugural celebration for young people.
   He expressed regret about his own missed opportunities as a
student.
   ``As one looks back at life, I'll be the first to admit I wish I
had taken education more seriously,'' Quayle said. ``Seriousness
about education is something, to be honest with you, I wish I had
done differently.''
   The former Indiana senator declined to release his college grade
transcripts during the fall campaign, and his record as a less than
diligent student was a frequent target of critics.
   ``Hard work has dignity, and let me tell you, hard work has
rewards,'' said Quayle. ``Those rewards are opportunities.''
   Quayle spoke briefly on Thursday about the coming administration
but made no reference to what he intends to do in a job that carries
few explicit duties. He promised the administration would ``work to
help the people that are left out.''
   During the campaign, Quayle had to fight the perception that he
was an intellectual lightweight who had led an easy life and joined
the Indiana National Guard to escape duty in Vietnam in 1969.
   Pointing to his 12 years in Congress, Quayle often said during
the early part of the campaign that he had about the same
legislative experience that John F. Kennedy had when he sought the
presidency in 1960. But he dropped that line after Democratic vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen told him during a debate,
``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''

   The government Friday banned fishing in
waters off a southern peninsula where a passing ship dumped plastic
bags containing a powerful poison, officials said.
   British military authorities from an airbase on the Akrotiri
peninsula blocked off beaches within the base, where the bags were
found, a base official said on condition of anonymity.
   Fishing in the area was banned ``until investigations are
completed to determine the extent of pollution following the
discovery of bags containing dangerous agricultural chemicals,'' the
government said.
   A police official said more than 100 plastic bags stamped with a
skull-and-crossbones poison warning washed up on the beaches since
Monday. They were labeled in Dutch as containing magnesium phosphate
_ a deadly poison used to control rodents.
   ``It is clear the bags were dumped into the sea from some passing
ship in order to dispose of the toxic substance,'' said Andreas
Dimitropoulos, director of the government Fisheries Department.
   The police source said other bags could have broken open in the
sea and polluted waters around the peninsula.

   The trial of a man jailed nine months on
drunken-driving charges was postponed because he refused to bathe.
   Superior Court Judge Betty Shelton-Cole, who had earlier ordered
Charles McCaffrey to clean up his act, sent him back to jail
Thursday and directed lawmen to ``use reasonable force'' to bathe
him.
   ``The man, I think, is playing games,'' the judge said. ``I feel
he's a health hazard to himself and to anyone who comes into contact
with him. I don't want him even to handle the chairs and tables
around here.''
   The judge isn't the only one offended by McCaffrey, 58, who is
being held in the Madison County Jail on charges of drunken driving,
causing an injury while driving intoxicated and driving with a
suspended license.
   Lawmen complained that their cars smelled bad after they took
McCaffrey to court appearances. ``We've had to clean (the cars) up
and spray some good stuff in there because he stinks,'' said Jail
Commander Richard Pickett.
   Fellow inmates also complained, so jail authorities isolated
McCaffrey. ``He has his own little room there to stink himself up
in,'' Pickett said.
   Pickett said jailers had been able to coax McCaffrey to take a
few baths during the nine months he has been held, ``but only after
some arguing.''
   Shelton-Cole rescheduled McCaffrey's trial for Feb. 16 and
ordered him to bathe according to jail rules and each day of the
trial.
   Pickett said his men would carry out the order. ``We'll just have
to take off our shirts and go back and get wet,'' he said.

   Former President Reagan, who admits to having a
superstitious nature, has all the same escaped a jinx that has long
haunted certain presidents.
   Reagan remains alive at the end of his presidency, even though he
was first elected in a year ending with zero.
   For nearly a century and a half, every president elected in such
a year had died in office. Reagan, despite a brush with cancer and
an assassination attempt, was the first to break the jinx.
   William Henry Harrison, elected in 1840, died of pneumonia at the
age of 67 a month after taking office.
   Abraham Lincoln, elected in 1860, was assassinated in 1865 at the
age of 56.
   James A. Garfield, elected in 1880, was assassinated a few months
later at the age of 50.
   William McKinley, re-elected in 1900, was assassinated in 1901 at
the age of 58.
   Warren G. Harding, elected in 1920, died of a heart attack in
1923 at the age of 58.
   Franklin D. Roosevelt, elected to his third term in 1940, died of
a cerebral hemmorhage in 1945 at the age of 63.
   John F. Kennedy, elected in 1960, was assassinated in 1963 at the
age of 46.
   Reagan, 77, survived an assassination attempt outside a
Washington hotel in 1981 and underwent successful surgery for cancer
of the colon in 1985.
   Reagan has often invoked superstitious beliefs from the world of
show business and sports and declined to disavow first lady Nancy
Reagan's reliance on astrology.

   George Bush actually became President three
minutes before he took the oath of office Friday, while Dan Quayle
had to wait a few minutes after taking his oath to become vice
president.
   The Constitution says that the clock _ not the pomp, ceremony and
oaths _ signals the transfer of the office from the old president to
the new one.
   The 20th Amendment to the Constitution specifies that the terms
of office of the president and vice president ``shall end at noon on
the 20th day of January ... and the terms of their successsors shall
then begin.''
   Bush took the oath of office at 12:03 p.m. EST.
   Quayle took the vice presidential oath several minutes before
noon.
   Thus, even though Quayle had taken the oath, Ronald Reagan was
still president and Bush still vice president until the stroke of
noon.
   A commentary on the Constitution published by the Library of
Congress in 1973 does note, however, that the new president can't
actually do anything until he takes the oath.
   ``Before he enter on Execution of his Office, he shall take the
following Oath or Affirmation,'' says Article II, Section 1, Clause
8 of the Constitution.
   ``What is the time relationship between a president's assumption
of office and his taking the oath?'' asks the commentary.
``Apparently the former comes first, this answer appearing to be the
assumption of the language of the clause. The Second Congress
assumed that President Washington took office on March 4, 1789,
although he did not take the oath until the following April 30.''

   Ronald Reagan flashed one last salute to George
Bush today and left the nation's capital to begin the life of an
ex-president in his beloved California.
   Reagan, walking hand-in-hand with his wife Nancy, bid the new
president and first lady Barbara Bush farewell with handshakes and
kisses on the east side of the Capitol at the conclusion of his
successor's inaugural ceremonies.
   Asked by a reporter for his final thoughts as he boarded a Marine
helicopter, Reagan said only, ``Carry on.'' The ex-president then
turned to salute Bush as Mrs. Reagan waved from the door of the
aircraft. The new president returned the gesture.
   The copter made a final sweep over the Mall and the White House
before heading for Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland for
the Reagans' flight home to Los Angeles.
   The former president reviewed a military honor guard at the air
base and was cheered by a crowd of about 2,000 before his plane took
off at 1:10 p.m. EST.
   Earlier in the day, Reagan paid a last, sentimental visit to the
Oval Office, dropping off a handwritten note wishing Bush well.
   Softly calling out ``goodbye'' and waving to a small knot of
staff members and journalists, Reagan walked for one last time down
the colonnade that connects his West Wing office to the executive
mansion.
   Reagan visited the office he'd used as the nation's 40th
president to check that all was in order and to leave the note for
his successor, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   As their final social event in the executive mansion, Reagan and
his wife Nancy then treated Bush and his wife Barbara, Dan Quayle
and his wife Marilyn, and the members of the congressional inaugural
escort committee to coffee and pastries in the Blue Room of the
executive residence.
   Fitzwater, who was present in the Oval Office, said Reagan was
greeted by his national security adviser Lt. Gen. Colin Powell.
   ``The world is quiet today, Mr. President,'' Powell told the
president.
   Fitzwater said the last piece of paper Reagan signed was a letter
to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, thanking her for
staunch support over the years.
   On their last morning in the residence, the first couple spent a
few quiet moments together in the private quarters, walking
hand-in-hand down its long central hallway and spending a few
moments in the Yellow Oval Room, where the windows overlook the
Washington and Jefferson Memorials, said Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman,
Elaine Crispen.
   As a present to Mrs. Bush, Mrs. Reagan left a large, long-stem
orchid plant in the presidential bedroom, Mrs. Crispen said.
   As the Reagans, Bushes and Quayles posed for pictures on the
north porch of the White House, Bush was asked if he had any
thoughts for Reagan on the president's last day in office. Only,
Bush replied, ``to wish him the very best as he leaves this job he
did so well.''
   On the eve of his departure from the White House, Reagan
expressed his confidence in both the nation and his successor,
calling Bush ``the man who should be in this office replacing me.''
   Before departing for Capitol Hill, the president and first lady
also bade a private farewell to the household staff in the residence.
   On the eve of his inaugural, Bush and Reagan met privately for
about 10 minutes in the Oval Office, reminiscing about their eight
years together. Then the pair went next door to the Roosevelt Room
to bid farewell to about 80 senior members of the White House staff,
Fitzwater said.
   ``The president just said he wanted to thank everyone for eight
years of work on his behalf,'' Fitzwater said, adding that Bush paid
tribute to Reagan, saying, ``I wouldn't be the president if not for
my teacher here, and my friend.''
   Reagan told the group he appreciated Bush's support over the
years, quipping, ``George never took my pulse once.''
   The president spent his last full workday doing routine
paperwork, giving interviews to reporters, and presenting the Medal
of Freedom to Secretary of State George Shultz and former U.S.
Ambassador to Japan Mike Mansfield.
   Reagan's speech at the event was delivered in the patriotic vein
that has marked his addresses for decades.
   ``There is nothing so precious and irreplaceable as America's
freedom,'' Reagan said. ``America's freedom does not belong to just
one nation. We are custodians of freedom for the world.''
   And, he added, ``George is the man who should be in this office
replacing me.''
   In an interview with wire service reporters, Reagan acknowledged
that he was leaving office frustrated over his inability to free
Americans held hostage in Lebanon. ``We don't know where they are,''
he conceded.
   Even to the end of his presidency, Reagan said, officials
continued to explore ``quietly and privately'' how to win freedom
for the nine Americans. ``There hasn't been a moment that this isn't
on our minds,'' he said.

   George Bush declared that ``a new breeze is
blowing'' on Friday, assuming the presidency of the United States in
balmy 50 degree weather.
   Indeed, a northwesterly wind averaging 18 miles per hour was
ruffling hairdos and judicial robes at the event. The wind, which
the National Weather Service said was gusting up to 25 miles per
hour, and cloudy skies, failed to detract from the ceremony.
   The pleasant weather for the outdoor event stood in sharp
contrast to the bitter cold that forced Ronald Reagan to move his
swearing-in indoors four years ago.
   Lost in that recollection is the fact that when he first took
office Reagan basked in what may have been the warmest oath-taking
since the ceremony was moved from March to January back in 1937.
Reagan's first inaugural came on a cloudy, 56 degree day in 1981.
   Friday's weather was nearly identical to that prevailing in 1953,
when Dwight D. Eisenhower was sworn-in on a cloudy, 49 degree day.

   Somewhere out there is a renowned scholar
who knows a Big Mac from a Whopper and can whip up a chocolate shake
in no time.
   That, at least, is what Washington State University is counting
on. The school announced Thursday it is establishing a distinguished
professorship of fast food service.
   The post in the school's Hotel and Restaurant Management program
was made possible by a $250,000 endowment from Taco Bell Corp. and a
matching grant from the state.
   HRA director Terry Umbreit said the university is looking for
someone who can help build the Washington State into the nation's
leading fast food educational institution.
   While that may give rise to jokes about classes like French Fries
101 or Special Sauce for the Non-Major, it's serious stuff to
William R. Bensyl, Taco Bell vice president for human resources.
   ``As our industry matures, our business strategies will become
more complex, and we will need trained professionals to help us
address a variety of issues,'' Bensyl said. ``Working in tandem with
an educational leader like WSU gives all of us a chance to benefit.''

   The protesters at Eastern Washington
University weren't chanting about abortion, war, famine or free
speech. They were worried about the really big issue.
   Photocopiers.
   ``We want copies. We want copies,'' shouted nearly 100 protesters
during a half-hour sit-in Thursday outside the office of school
President Alex Schilt.
   The issue actually had serious underpinnings. Among the
protesters' demands were on-campus child care, improvements to the
school's book store and withdrawal from the Big Sky athletic
conference.
   Athletes, the students argued, were draining money from more
appropriate expenditures. Such as photocopiers.
   A leader of the demonstration, Larry Davis, complained that he
often needed to copy as many as 50 pages a week for classes but had
difficulty finding a machine in working order.
   ``During finals and midterms, they're out continually,'' said
Davis.
   Schilt told the students that school officials had ordered three
new copiers and would improve wiring in the library that he blamed
for the frequent shutdowns. ``We're going to solve the photocopier
problem,'' he said.
   He also said he asked the Legislature for $1 million for child
care, and the issue of athletics is being studied.

   Florida's Supreme Court today refused to
postpone Ted Bundy's execution, rejecting his lawyers' plea to allow
lower courts to decide whether the suspected serial killer was sane
during his murder trial.
   ``He wasn't able to assist his lawyers, in fact he sabotaged a
lot of what they were trying to do,'' attorney James Coleman told
reporters after arguing the Bundy case before the Florida justices.
   Coleman was expected to carry the appeal to the federal courts.
   Bundy served as his own attorney through much of his trial in the
murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Diane Leach of Lake City. He is
scheduled to die Tuesday in Florida's electric chair for her
kidnap-slaying.
   ``Much of what he did, even at the hearing, undermined his
defense and his lawyers were having problems controlling him,
getting him to make decisions ... getting him to stick to
decisions,'' said Coleman, who is representing Bundy without a fee.
   Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said after the hearing
that Bundy's attorneys were ``grasping at a straw.''
   ``All the courts have found Ted Bundy to be competent during the
Lake City hearing,'' Butterworth said. ``We believe all the issues
of competency were addressed last year by the federal courts.''
   The session was scheduled after Circuit Judge John Peach of Lake
City denied three claims Thursday in Bundy's appeal and refused to
stay the execution, set for 7 a.m. Tuesday at Florida State Prison
near Starke.
   While the attorneys made their arguments, Bundy was scheduled to
meet with FBI officials at the prison. The former University of Utah
law student also was expected to meet with authorities from
Colorado, Idaho, Washington and Utah through the weekend. He is
suspected in the murders of three dozen women in several Western
states.
   One of his attorneys, Diana Weiner, has said Bundy is committed
to revealing all he knows about unsolved murders. She didn't specify
which cases.
   But Columbia County State Attorney Jerry Blair, who prosecuted
Bundy for the 1978 murder of Kimberly Leach, said it is time for him
to be executed.
   ``It makes a mockery of our judicial system every day that Ted
Bundy continues to live,'' Blair said. ``People are virtually up in
arms about this and every day that justice is delayed, justice is
either denied or at least diminished.''
   The defense appeal centered on allegations that Bundy's
competence to stand trial wasn't adequately reviewed in either the
Leach case or an earlier conviction in the slayings of two Chi Omega
sorority sisters at Florida State University.
   Attorneys also argued Bundy shouldn't be executed for the Leach
slaying while his competency during the Chi Omega slayings is still
being challenged in federal court and Circuit Judge Wallace Jopling
improperly discussed the Bundy case with prosecutors without defense
attorneys present.
   All claims were rejected by Peach, who heard the arguments after
Jopling disqualified himself Thursday.
   Peach said the defense should have raised some of the claims
earlier and was procedurally barred from raising them at this time.
He made his ruling after hearing about 40 minutes of oral arguments.
   In Olympia, Wash., Gov. Booth Gardner said Thursday he considers
it inappropriate for Bundy to play for time by offering to talk
about his crimes.
   ``It would be nice to have the information he might be willing to
divulge. But I don't think that (reprieve) is the means to get it,''
said Gardner, a backer of capital punishment. ``I don't think his
holding that information as ransom at this juncture is appropriate.''
   Bundy, whose case was depicted in the television miniseries ``The
Deliberate Stranger,'' was sentenced to death for the Feb. 9, 1978,
murder of Miss Leach, a Lake City junior high school student.
   In a separate trial, he also was sentenced to death for murdering
two Florida State University Chi Omega sisters in their sorority
house in January in the early morning hours of Jan. 15, 1978.
   Gov. Bob Martinez signed the death warrant Tuesday, less than an
hour after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear new arguments to
set aside Bundy's death sentence.
   Bundy has been granted a stay of execution three times before.
The last was issued Nov. 17, 1986, six hours before his scheduled
execution, when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
sent the case back for an evidentiary hearing.
   The appeals court, and later the U.S. Supreme Court, rejected the
appeal.

   Here are excerpts from a transcript of
President Bush's inaugural address Friday.
   We meet on democracy's front porch. A good place to talk as
neighbors, and as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made
whole, when our differences, for a moment, are suspended. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   I come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with
promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it
better.
   For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom
seems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the
dictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas
blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree.
   A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom
stands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and new
action to be taken. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Great nations of the world are moving toward democracy _ through
the door to freedom.
   Men and women of the world move toward free markets _ through the
door to prosperity.
   The people of the world agitate for free expression and free
thought _ through the door to the moral and intellectual
satisfactions that only liberty allows.
   We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom
is right. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for
man on earth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and
the exercise of free will unhampered by the state. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   America today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil _ a place
we cannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and
proudly, but as a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond
what we see, and that our strength is a force for good.
   But have we changed as nation, even in our time? Are we
enthralled with material things, less appreciative of the nobility
of work and sacrifice?
   My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not
the measure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We
cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank
account. We must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a
loyal friend, a loving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his
neighborhood and town better than he found it.
   And what do we want the men and women who work with us to say
when we're no longer there? That we were more driven to succeed than
anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had
gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of
friendship.
   No president, no government, can teach us to remember what is
best in what we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this
government can help make a difference; if he can celebrate the
quieter, deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk, but of
better hearts and finer souls; if he can do these things, then he
must.
   America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high
moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to
make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world.
   My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and
roaming _ there are the children who have nothing, no love, no
normalcy _ there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement
to whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rules
the slums. There is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the
streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to become
mothers of children they can't care for and might not love. They
need our care, our guidance, and education; though we bless them for
choosing life.
   The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money
alone could end these problems. But we have learned that that is not
so. And in any case, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring
down. We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need.
   We will make the hard choices, looking at what we have, perhaps
allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need
and prudent safety.
   And then we will do the wisest thing of all: we will turn to the
only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the
goodness and the courage of the American people.
   And, I am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others _ a
new activism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And we must bring the federal budget into balance. And we must
ensure that America stands before the world united: strong, at
peace, and fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult.
...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And our great parties have two often been far apart and
untrusting of each other.
   It's been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us still. But,
friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago; and,
surely, the Statute of Limitations has been reached. This is a fact:
The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford
to be sundered by a memory.
   A new breeze is blowing _ and the old bipartisanship must be made
new again. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The American people await action. They didn't send us here to
bicker. They ask us to rise above the merely partisan. ``In crucial
things, unity'' _ and this, my friends, is crucial.
   To the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We
will stay strong to protect the peace. The ``offered hand'' is a
reluctant fist; once made, strong and can be used with great effect.
   There are today Americans who are held against their will in
foreign lands, and Americans who are unaccounted for. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   While keeping our alliances and friendships around the world
strong, ever strong, we will continue the new closeness with the
Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with progress.
One might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph
of hope and strength over experience. But hope is good. And so is
strength. And vigilance. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   There are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up
united and express our intolerance. And the most obvious now is
drugs. And when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may
as well have been a deadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body,
the soul of our country. And there is much to be done and to be
said, but take my word for it: This scourge will stop. ...
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Some see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets
calling. And sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with
many pages _ and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness
and meaning.
   The new breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds _ and so
today a chapter begins: a small and stately story of unity,
diversity and generosity _ shared, and written, together.

<HEAD>Bush Says Nation `Made Whole,' Declares `Age of Offered Hand'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates in top 10 grafs with Bush quotes, nominations submitted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush declared today as he took office as
president that he was doing so on ``a day when our nation is made
whole.'' Still, he said, ``My friends, we have work to do.''
   After reciting his oath of office, the nation's 41st president
did go to work, formally submitting his Cabinet nominations to the
Senate and signing a proclamation making Sunday a National Day of
Prayer and Thanksgiving.
   Bush, in his inaugural address to a crowd estimated at 200,000 at
the West Front of the Capitol, said partisan bickering must give way
to ``the age of the offered hand.''
   He pledged leadership that would seek consensus through
cooperation at home but wield a ``reluctant fist'' abroad if
necessary.
   ``The `offered hand' is a reluctant fist; once made, strong and
can be used with great effect.''
   ``There is much to do. Tomorrow, the work begins,'' he said. ``I
do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart
is larger.''
   ``The people await action. They did not send us here to bicker,''
Bush said, adding: ``To the world, too, we offer new engagement and
a renewed vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace.
   Bush submitted his Cabinet nominations, all previously announced,
and signed the prayer-day proclamation at a ceremony after the
inauguration in the Capitol's ornate President's Room, where Abraham
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and Lyndon Johnson
signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   As he was leaving, Bush was asked about his goodbye to former
President Reagan. ``I was trying to keep the tears from running down
my cheeks. After eight years of friendship, it was pretty tough,''
Bush said.
   He began his speech with warm praise for his predecessor, saying:
``There is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts
and in our history. President Reagan, on behalf of our nation, I
thank you for the wonderful things you have done for America.''
   He traded salutes with Reagan on the other side of the Capitol
after the swearing-in ceremony, then Reagan's helicopter left for
Andrews Air Force Base on the trip home to California and retirement.
   In his speech, which lasted about 20 minutes, Bush said, ``We
meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors
and friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when
our differences are, for a moment, suspended.''
   Sounding again a theme of his presidential campaign, Bush said:
``America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high
moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to
make kinder the face of a nation and gentler the face of the world.''
   He said, ``My first act as president is a prayer.''
   ``There is just one use of power and it is to serve people. Help
us to remember, Lord,'' Bush said.
   Bush said he was assuming the presidency ``at a moment rich with
promise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time. But we can make it
better.''
   ``A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom
stands ready to push on. There is new ground to be broken and new
action to be taken. There are times when the future seems thick as a
fog; you sit and wait hoping the mist will lift and reveal the right
path.''
   ``A new breeze is blowing, and the old bipartisanship must be
made new again. To my friends _ and yes, I do mean friends _ in the
loyal opposition _ and yes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand.''
   ``For this is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand.''
   ``We must act on what we know. I take as my guide the hope of a
saint: In crucial things, unity; in important things, diversity; in
all things, generosity.''
   As he did during his presidential campaign, Bush made an appeal
in his address for reaching out to the disadvantaged and the
homeless.
   Americans' possessions ``are not the measure of our lives,'' he
said.
   ``My friends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost
and roaming. There are children who have nothing, no love and no
normalcy. There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement
to whatever addiction _ drugs, welfare, demoralization that rules
the slums.''
   ``There is crime to be conquered,'' he added, ``the rough crime
of the streets. There are young women to be helped who are about to
become mothers of children they cannot care for and might not love.
They need our care, our guidance, and education, though we bless
them for chosing life.''
   He talked in general terms about working with Congress to balance
the federal budget and called for a new harmony that he said should
replace ``a chorus of discordant voices'' on budget issues.
   While suggesting that the Vietnam War ``cleaves us still,'' Bush
said it was time for Democrats and Republicans to put aside
differences formed in those war days. ``Friends, that war began in
earnest a quarter century ago; and surely the statute of limitations
has been reached,'' he said.
   ``The people await action. They did not send us here to bicker.''
   The new president made only passing reference to the U.S.
hostages still held in Lebanon and ``Americans who are unaccounted
for,'' saying without elaboration: ``Assistance can be shown here,
and will be long remembered. Good will begets good will.''
   On Soviet relations, Bush vowed to ``continue the new closeness
with the Soviet Union, consistent both with our security and with
progress.''
   He called improving U.S.-Soviet relations ``the triumph of hope
and strength over experience.''
   Bush called for a national expression of intolerance and action
to stop ``this scourge'' of drugs.
   Before being driven to the Capitol with Reagan, Bush and his vice
president Dan Quayle and their families attended a church service
where Bush said he prayed for ``strength ... strength, peace'' and
to ``do a good job.''
   When reporters called out to him afterward, asking what the day
meant to him, he replied quietly, ``An awful lot.''
   Mrs. Bush said, ``Guess who was up first'' in the house full of
children, grandchildren and other family members.
   She pointed to the president-elect, who smiled broadly. ``He got
up at 6 a.m.,'' she said.

<HEAD>`Desert Rat' Lord Harding Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Field Marshal Lord Harding, who commanded armor at
the World War II battle of El Alamein and shrugged off death threats
as governor of Cyprus in the 1950s, died Friday at the age of 92.
   The former chief of the Imperial General Staff died at home in
Nether Compton in southwestern England following a long illness,
said his son, John.
   ``He will be remembered most of all for his distinguished
leadership in the second World War, more especially with the 8th
Army (known as the Desert Rats) in the Western Desert,'' said Alfred
Morris, a member of Parliament.
   Lord Harding was a month from retirement as chief of the Imperial
General Staff when he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief
of Cyprus, then a British colony, in 1955.
   Throughout his two-year tour, he was the target of a ``Death to
Harding'' campaign by the EOKA guerrilla organization. A bomb was
once found beneath his bed _ ``an occupational hazard,'' Harding
said in later years.
   One of his most famous actions was to order the banishment of
Archbishop Makarios to the Seychelles. Makarios was later president
of Cyprus, which became independent in 1960.
   Allan Francis (John) Harding was born in 1896.
   In World War I, he served in Egypt, took part in the Gallipoli
and Palestine campaigns, was wounded twice and won the Military
Cross.
   He was an acting major at the age of 21 and an acting
lieutenant-colonel 13 months later. After the war he was recommended
for a regular army commission on account of his ``innate gift for
command''.
   In 1940, he was brigadier general staff, Western Desert, and
commanded the 7th Armored Division in the Battle of El Alamein and
on the victorious pursuit of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's German
forces to Tripoli. He was wounded when a shell landed beside the
tank on which he was standing to observe the enemy.
   In the autumn 1942 desert battle, one of the decisive battles of
the war, British forces routed the Germans and their Italian allies.
   He also commanded the 13th Corps in the Italian campaign.
   In 1951, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the British Army
of the Rhine, and remained in Germany until his appointment as chief
of the Imperial General Staff in 1952. His promotion to field
marshal came in July 1953.
   He was raised to the peerage in 1958 as Baron Harding of
Petherton.
   In later life, he spoke frequently in the House of Lords and was
appointed director of several companies. He was chairman of the
Horserace Betting Levy Board and in 1973 became chairman of the
British Casino Association.
   He also worked to help the disabled.
   Arrangements were being made for a private funeral to be followed
by a memorial service in Westminster Abbey.

<HEAD>Interior Cuts Fees for Drilling on Public Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department, in the last hours of
the Reagan administration, sharply lowered on Thursday the rent most
drillers pay to use federal lands.
   The department said in a notice published in the Federal Register
that it would charge $1 per acre for many onshore oil and gas leases
issued before 1987, instead of the $2 to $3 it had been charging.
This will cost the government about $35 million a year for three
years beginning March 1, said Marta Witt, spokeswoman for the
department's Bureau of Land Management.
   Leases issued after passage of a 1987 law revamping such
procedures carry a statutory rental fee of $1.50 per acre for five
years and $2 thereafter.
   The decision should ``keep more lands under lease and provide
additional capital for exploration and development,'' said the
notice signed by outgoing Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel.
   ``This action is consistent with other steps the department has
taken over the past two years, when oil prices bottomed out and U.S.
production began to dwindle to the point of serious concerns, to the
point of even national security impact,'' said Tim Locke, a
spokesman for the bureau.
   The American Petroleum Institute, the principal trade
organization, reported earlier in the week that U.S. production in
1988 was 8.1 million barrels a day, the lowest in 12 years and a 3
percent decline from the previous year.
   In 1985, production was 9.1 million barrels per day.
   The oil price collapse of 1986 devasted domestic production and
exploration, stimulated by the long price run-up of the 1970s. The
Reagan administration had rejected all calls by domestic producers
for a protective tariff, but did grant other rental reductions in
1986 and eased some regulations.
   The number of exploration rigs at work has fallen from more than
4,000 in 1981 to fewer than 1,000 today. The amount of federal land
under lease has fallen from more than 140 million acres in 1983 to
less than half that today.
   About half the acreage now under lease already carries a rental
charge of $1 per acre, said Ms. Witt.
   The rental charge is only a small part of the bureau's royalty
revenue, estimated for all minerals at about $800 million annually.
The department also will earn about $2.5 billion this year from oil
produced from the outer continental shelf offshore.
   In another action, Hodel recommended that Congress approve the
long-studied trade of land in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge for land owned by native corporations in other Alaskan
refuges.
   The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could
hold as much oil as the huge field at Prudhoe Pay 65 to 100 miles to
the west, according to some estimates. But Congress has refused to
permit drilling there.
   The trade would give the native corporations mineral rights and a
stake in the development of the Arctic refuge in exchange for
consolidation of federal ownership in the other refuges. The General
Accounting Office reported to Congress last year that the Interior
Department was vastly overstating the value of the lands it would
receive in the deal.
   Reacting to that proposal, the Heritage Foundation urged that
publicly owned land be opened to drilling and mining because, the
conservative organization said, trouble from the Soviet Union or
South Africa could endanger the U.S. supply of oil and strategic
minerals.

   Barbara Bush chose an Arnold Scaasi blue satin
and velvet gown to wear at Friday's round of inaugural balls.
   The saffire blue dress she chose for the black-tie festivities
following her husband's inauguration featured a low, square neckline
and long, closely fitted sleeves.
   First ladies-to-be traditionally release design sketches of their
dresses several days in advance of the events, Mrs. Bush's office
only made the information available on the afternoon of the main
inaugural balls.
   The bodice of Mrs. Bush's gown was made of bright blue velvet.
The full-length skirt was of the same color in satin, draped
asymmetrically on the right side and caught at the hip by a bow.
   Mrs. Bush's accessories included a matching stole, made of the
saffire blue satin on one side and velvet on the other, a saffire
blue handbag of the same material and saffire blue shoes.
   As usual, Mrs. Bush chose her traditional pearl jewelry to wear
with her gown.
   For the swearing-in ceremony on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Bush wore a
turquoise wool coat and white wool crepe dress ensemble designed by
Bill Blass.
   The collarless, long-sleeved dress was accented with brass
buttons and was belted at the waist.
   The coat, straight in its design, was also accented with large
gold buttons and a shirt-style collar.
   Although the advisory released by Mrs. Bush's office said she'd
had a turquoise, pill-box style hat made by designer Patricia
Underwood to complement her coat and dress, Mrs. Bush did not wear
it to the inaugural ceremonies on Capitol Hill.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Bush poked fun at her own down-to-earth image
and warned that in contrast to the high-fashion style of the
outgoing first lady, Nancy Reagan, she has no plans to be a
clotheshorse.
   ``Please notice _ hairdo, makeup, designer dress,'' she told the
audience at a tribute to her at the Kennedy Center.
   Then holding open the jacket of her Scaasi-designed blue suit
with matching blouse, she quipped, ``Look at me good this week _
because it's the only week.''
   Meanwhi;e. Marilyn Quayle plans wear a gown designed by Denise
Ervin, a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and
Merchandising in Los Angeles.
   ``It's all pretty exciting,'' the Omaha native said in an
interview.
   She was one of three students from the institute chosen by Mrs.
Quayle to design the wardrobe she and her 10-year-old daughter,
Corinne, wore inauguration day.
   Norine Fuller, executive director of the school's Washington
office, said Mrs. Quayle selected the young designers as a ``gesture
of encouragement to students. ... She also believes this is an
excellent way of highlighting young American talent.''
   Daniel Caudill, 22, of Orange County, Calif., designed the outfit
Mrs. Quayle wore to her husband's swearing-in. Allison Miller, 24,
of Long Beach designed the clothing that Corinne Quayle wore to that
ceremony.
   ``From our research on Mrs. Quayle, we decided that she is a
smart, straightforward woman who is pretty classic in her clothing
tastes,'' Ms. Ervin said.

   Classified federal documents involving
national security were found in the offices of a Korean-American
businessman charged with trying to export large amounts of deadly
nerve gas, officials said today.
   U.S. Customs agents searching the Summit import-export business
of Juwhan Yun found lying on top of a desk papers in both Korean and
English marked ``Classified and confidential,'' Customs Agent Frank
P. Ventura testified in U.S. District Court.
   Ventura said military intelligence officials from Fort Monmouth
identified the documents as coming from the ``Joint Electronics
Warfare Command.'' Officials did not explain the nature or
responsibility of the command.
   Yun, 48, of Short Hills, was arrested Jan. 12 at what he thought
was to be a meeting with an arms supplier, who was actually a
Customs undercover agent. The arrest took place at the U.S. Customs
offices in Newark, where the meeting was arranged after a
seven-month investigation.
   Authorities said Yun sought to acquire missiles and military
radar equipment for shipment to Iran.
   Yun faces charges of conspiracy to violate the Arms Export
Control Act by trying to arrange shipments of 500 quarter-ton bombs
of sarin, a nerve gas. Authorities said they believe the gas was
intended for Iran, but they added that has not been verified.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer disclosed the existence of
the classified documents after Yun's attorney, Stephen Dratch, said
his client was able to meet $2 million bail set Tuesday by U.S.
Magistrate Ronald Hedges.
   Ms. Singer said Yun's possession of the documents increased the
risk that he would flee because he may have ties with foreign
governments. Those governments, Ms. Singer said, now may have a
vested interest in keeping Yun from standing trial in the case.
   Hedges asked Ms. Singer if the documents indicated espionage. Ms.
Singer declined to comment.
   Yun's possession of the documents might expose him to a more
serious charge of unauthorized possession of secret documents, Ms.
Singer said.
   ``He was apparently in the process of using them,'' she said. She
did not elaborate.
   Ms. Singer said the contents of the papers were not relevant to
Yun's bail status, but involved national security.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, in his first acts as president
Friday, signed a proclamation making Sunday a National Day of Prayer
and Thanksgiving, and added his signature to the nomination of 17
Cabinet members and administration advisers.
   This will ``put me on the payroll,'' Bush joked as he entered the
President's Room just off the Senate floor.
   Joined by congressional leaders, the president signed the
proclamation and then distributed a handful of pens to House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas; Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine; House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.; and House
Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., arrived late and
received the pen used by Bush for the nomination of Dole's wife.
Elizabeth Dole is labor secretary-designate.
   In all, Bush used 10 pens to sign the proclamation and 23 to sign
the nominations. The finepoint Parker pens bear the presidential
seal and Bush's signature.
   The ceremony took place beneath a gold, crystal and beveled glass
chandelier in the ornate President's Room, where gilded-edge mirrors
covered two walls and paintings of the muses filled the ceilings.
   Abraham Lincoln used the room to sign the Emancipation
Proclamation and former President Lyndon Johnson added his signature
to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   As he was leaving, Bush was asked about saying goodbye to former
President Reagan.
   ``I was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks.
That's what was going through my mind. After eight years of
friendship, it was pretty tough,'' Bush said.

   Willie Horton, the furloughed Massachusetts
inmate pictured in one of the most effective TV commercials of the
1988 presidential campaign, says George Bush used him to duck the
real issues facing the country.
   ``Bush did what he had to do to win. He took my whole case and
won with it,'' Horton was quoted as saying in Friday's New York
Newsday. ``Bush used me as a tool.''
   Horton, a 38-year-old murderer, fled in 1986 while on his 10th
furlough from a Massachusetts prison. A year later, he was arrested
and convicted of rape, kidnapping and assault with intent to murder
a Maryland couple.
   The case was used in Bush commercials against Michael Dukakis,
governor of Massachusetts.
   Interviewed at the Maryland State Penitentiary in Baltimore,
Horton said Bush used his case ``to camouflage the real issues'' and
avoid talking about more important things such as ``people being
broke.''
   He is in the Maryland prison on two life sentences, plus 85
years, and still owes Massachusetts the rest of his life sentence.
   Horton said he wanted Dukakis to win. ``I thought of letting the
newspaper, television reporters come in to see me, but then I said,
`I'm going to wait.' I don't think people wanted to hear from me
what I had to say about Bush,'' he said.

   The Omaha Ballet had hoped to make at least
$20,000 from a performance by ballet great Rudolf Nureyev. Instead,
it lost about $18,500.
   Nureyev drew 2,021 people, short of the capacity of 2,759.
   Attendance accounted for $61,500 in ticket revenue, said Thomas
Hosier, president of the ballet board.
   But the performance cost about $80,000 to stage, including artist
fees, hall rental, marketing and insurance, he said Thursday.
   He said that ticket prices, which ranged from $25 to $65, might
have discouraged some people from attending and that others may have
been concerned about Nureyev's age _ 50.

   Actor Griffin O'Neal, placed on probation
in 1987 for the boating death of a friend, was sent to jail for 18
days Friday for not completing the community-service portion of the
sentence.
   O'Neal, 24, of Los Angeles, served only 60 of the 400 hours
required when he was sentenced in the 1986 death of Gian-Carlo
Coppola, 23, son of director Francis Ford Coppola. O'Neal, son of
actor Ryan O'Neal, was acquitted of manslaughter in the case but
convicted of reckless boating.
   ``I was found in violation, which was true,'' O'Neal said. ``I'm
here to pay my dues, and I'm willing to do it.''
   Judge Martin A. Wolff said he was giving O'Neal credit for
completing a boating safety video, answering questions at a
telephone hotline, paying a fine and completing some of the required
public service work.
   However, he rejected defense atorney T. Joseph Touhey's
explanation that O'Neal failed to complete his public service work
at a volunteer center 25 miles from his house because his driver's
license was suspended and he had no car.

<HEAD>No Ruling on Marcos Health; Hearing Off Until Feb. 9</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A dispute over whether Ferdinand Marcos is too
ill to be arraigned on racketeering charges remained unresolved
Friday when a hearing on the former Philippine president was
adjourned until next month.
   More testimony by medical experts on the state of Marcos' health
is expected when the hearing resumes Feb. 9 before U.S. District
Judge John Keenan.
   The 71-year-old Marcos suffered a collapsed lung Thursday and was
reported in guarded but stable condition Friday at St. Francis
Medical Center in Honolulu.
   One of his doctors, Calvin Wong, said earlier that Marcos
apparently was out of danger.
   Marcos may have had a heart irregularity during the lung
collapse, hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop said. The deposed leader
was in the hospital already for pneumonia and bronchial asthma.
   Friday's hearing was adjourned because the judge had prior
commitments.
   Keenan is to determine if Marcos is fit to stand trial on charges
he looted $103 million from his country. Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, 59, have been living in Hawaii since their ouster in a
popular uprising in 1986.
   After his indictment in October, Marcos asked that the
arraignment be moved from New York to Hawaii for health reasons. He
has been hospitalized three times in the last two months, twice for
congestive heart failure.
   Government attorneys have informally agreed that Marcos need not
be brought to New York for arraignment. But on Wednesday, Marcos'
attorneys argued that the leader was now too ill to be arraigned
anywhere, or even tried at all.
   Prosecutors on Friday cross-examined Dr. Martin Cogan, an
internist who was the fourth doctor called as a witness by Marcos'
lawyers. Cogan said Marcos was on at least 20 medications before his
most recent hospitalization.
   ``That makes it difficult to fine-tune treatment,'' said Cogan, a
cardiovascular specialist who examined Marcos last month in Hawaii.
   Thursday's session was interrupted by word of Marcos's lung
collapse, prompting Keenan to say that if the medical reports were
true, ``There is no way in the world he is going to be arraigned in
a courtroom in the next couple of weeks _ or maybe months.''

   Andrei D. Sakharov, rejected as a parliamentary
candidate by the Academy of Sciences, on Friday presented a platform
calling for military cuts and more democracy to colleagues who in
protest nominated him for another seat.
   ``I am far from enthusiastic about much of what has happened in
our country in the past year,'' Sakharov softly told co-workers at
the Lebedev Institute of Physics, citing new limitations on
cooperatives, meetings and demonstations, and the government
reaction to the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute.
   The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and dean of the Soviet
human rights movement spoke at the institute from which he was
banished for almost seven years for his criticism of the Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.
   Sakharov's bumpy candidacy for the Congress of People's Deputies,
the new parliamentary body President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says is a
crucial element of reform, illustrated the bugs remaining in the
cumbersome electoral system approved in December, as well as the
resistance facing many of the staunchest backers of reform.
   Sakharov, appearing tired and resting his chin on a hand that
clutched his glasses, listened quietly as hundreds of his colleagues
unanimously demanded that the decision by the academy leadership be
declared invalid, and nominated him for a seat in the congress from
the Oktyabr region of Moscow, where the institute is located.
   Institute workers already had approved Sakharov's candidacy by a
vote of 1,543-22, but crowded into the conference hall to hear a
20-minute outline of his views on foreign affairs, ethnic policy,
the economy and human rights. Sakharov then answered written
questions sent to the podium.
   Sakharov, who in September called for a 50 percent cut in the
amount of time Soviets must spend in military service, departed from
his two pages of text to term Gorbachev's announcement Wednesday
that the number of military personnel will be cut by 12 percent
``extraordinarily important.''
   ``But I think more radical cuts are necessary,'' he added. ``They
are fully possible in the present international circumstances.''
   But he criticized the Kremlin's policy on the ethnic disturbances
in Armenia and Azerbaijan, called a new law on meetings and
demonstrations ``an anti-perestroika law,'' and a directive by the
Council of Ministers in December ordering cooperatives out of some
lucrative businesses as ``a step backward.''
   He said it was ``senseless'' to insist that the Nagorno-Karabakh,
the source of the bloodletting between Armenia and Azerbaijan,
remain part of Azerbaijan. ``This is completely unacceptable for the
entire Armenian population,'' he said.
   He renewed his demands for release of all political prisoners and
laws guaranteeing complete freedom of association.
   If elected, Sakharov pledged to pursue his views with all his
strength.
   Sakharov helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the 1950s,
but turned to human rights activities in the 1960s and 1970s. He was
banished in January 1980 to the closed city of Gorky for his
criticism of the drive into Afghanistan and remained there until
Gorbachev allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986.
   Since then he generally has supported Gorbachev, but occasionally
criticizes some aspects of the Soviet leader's policies.
   The Academy of Sciences has the right to elect 25 members of the
new congress, which will be made up of 2,250 people. A third will be
elected from social, political or trade union organizations,
including the Academy. The remaining two-thirds will be selected on
the basis of balloting in geographic districts.
   A meeting of Academy of Sciences leaders on Wednesday chose 23
candidates to present to the entire membership as candidates from
among more than 130 members who were nominated. Two more were chosen
Thursday by affiliates of the academy.
   Sakharov was nominated by more than 50 institutes of the academy,
but was not among the final 23. Other losers were such reformers as
space scientist Roald Sagdeev, nominated by 25 institutes, and
economists Gavril Popov, nominated by 16, and Nikolai Shmelev,
nominated by 11.
   The newspaper Izvestia said that among the others not chosen were
economist Abel Aganbegyan, and Dmitri Likhachev, the dean of Soviet
historians.
   Now nominated as a candidate from a geographical district,
Sakharov's candidacy must pass through at least one local electoral
commission before it can be presented to voters March 26. Supporters
said several other institutes would also nominate Sakharov from the
same district to strengthen the possibility his name will be on the
final ballot.
   The unanimous resolution from the Lebedev institute complained
that the leadership of the Academy of Sciences excluded any
representatives of scientific workers from taking part in their
deliberations, and that all those nominated were top-ranking figures
in the academy.
   It said none of them were nominated by as many institutes as
Sakharov, Sagdeev, Popov or Shmelev. It said the academy's decision
was invalid because those chosen did not receive an absolute
majority of votes from the 370 members of the selection committee.
Only about 190 members actually attended the session and voted, it
said.

   It took a six-month study to settle the
issue, but Dow Chemical Co. has decided to keep its middle name, as
well as the first and last.
   Frank Popoff, Dow president and chief executive officer, said
Friday that an internal committee and a consultant had looked into
changing the 92-year-old corporate identity and recommended against
any change.
   Dow spokesman Tom Henderson said he didn't know how much the
study cost, and he wouldn't reveal any alternative names that were
considered.
   In October, the company was said to be considering dropping
``Chemical'' from its name to reflect Dow's expanding role in
non-chemical industries such as insulation and household goods.
   For years, the Dow name was associated with napalm and Agent
Orange defoliant, both of which were used during the Vietnam War,
but Henderson said, ``I don't think it was part of the consideration
of changing the name.''
   ``We are not inundated any more with negatives around the Agent
Orange issue,'' he said.

   President Bush turned his inauguration into a
family affair Friday, gathering his brood on the platform where he
took the oath of office and singling out his 87-year-old mother for
a special kiss.
   Bush's four sons and daughter joined their mother, Barbara, at
the Capitol for their father's swearing-in ceremony. Some held their
toddlers during the outdoor event.
   With his clan near him, Bush highlighted family issues in his
inaugural address. He spoke of the homeless and the needs of
children and mothers who cannot support them.
   Before he assumed the presidency, Bush walked onto the platform
and, spotting his mother, Dorothy, leaned over to kiss her. Mrs.
Prescott Bush has not been well, suffering from a bad back and
calcium deterioration in her bones, Bush told reporters earlier.
   The matriarch, the president said, is revered by her family.
   ``Many of our family are here and they all, as does this son,
worship the ground she walks on,'' he said.
   Barbara Bush, meanwhile, said she has two goals as first lady.
``I'd like to make George happy, and I'd like to do my own thing,''
she said in an interview on CBS-TV. In that respect, Mrs. Bush said
she'd follow the example of Bess Truman, President Truman's wife.
   One thing she'll avoid, Mrs. Bush said, is telling her husband
what to do. ``I really don't lecture him,'' she said. ``You know,
that's how you stay happily married.''
   As for her entertaining, Mrs. Bush said the couple will continue
to have their friends and family over on Sundays. ``We've done that
every Sunday of our married life, and we're not going to change
that.''
   Standards will be high for official entertaining, though. ``We're
going to have wonderful food and beautiful flowers and you're going
to be very proud of the White House.''
   Mrs. Bush chose a wool turquoise coat buttoned over a white wool
crepe dress designed by Bill Blass for the swearing-in. She was
hatless at the ceremony.
   All week, the nation's capital has been filling with Bush
relatives, 250 in all. Most have stayed at the posh Jefferson Hotel.
   Bush's immediate family _ offspring and their spouses as well as
10 grandchildren _ spent two nights at Blair House, the presidential
guest quarters. Friday night, they move across the street to sleep
at the White House.
   The family has been a source of strength during the inaugural
week, Bush said. ``It's a nice period ... a nice time to have a lot
of family around,'' he said.
   The Bush family, most of whose members are good-natured and
athletic, turned parts of Blair House into a playpen, the president
said.
   With grandchildren running around, ``I wonder that some flying
missile will clean out some plates over there,'' he said jokingly.
   One grand-daughter, Noelle Bush, 11, grabbed the spotlight on
Thursday when she danced, sang and played the accordion with a
mariachi band at a musical tribute to Mrs. Bush. Before the
performance, Noelle was nervous, Bush said.
   ``I went to kiss her goodnight ... she was the only one who
popped her eyes open and chatted with me,'' he said.
   Noelle speaks Spanish as does her father, Jeb, 35, a Miami real
estate developer, and her Mexican-born mother, Columba.
   With the exception of son Marvin, 32, an investment counselor in
Alexandria, Va., none of the Bush offspring live in the Washington
area.
   But George Jr., 42, one of his father's closest advisers, worked
in the campaign and at the transition office. He and his wife,
Laura, live in Midland, Texas, where he is in the oil business.
   Another son, Neil, 33, works in the oil business in Denver, Colo.
Mrs. Bush has said her interest in reading and literacy was sparked
initially by Neil's dyslexia, a reading disability.
   The Bushes' only daughter, Dorothy, 29, lives in Maine with her
husband, William LeBlond and two children. She has long worked on
her father's campaigns.

   A U.N. official said Friday she hopes President
Bush will end a three-year boycott of U.N. family-planning programs
that Washington has accused of supporting forced abortions in China.
   Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Fund for Population
Activities, said, ``We see a new opportunity with the new
administration.''
   The United States has withheld about $85 million from the agency
since 1985, charging that Chinese family-planning programs backed by
the agency involve forced abortions.
   However, Ms. Sadik said Friday, ``We are not supporting any
abortion program anywhere in the world.''
   She also said Chinese officials had stressed to her that although
isolated cases of coercion do crop up, China does not force women to
undergo abortions.
   Ms. Sadik said Bush ws ``strongly supportive of population
policies'' as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1971-73. She
also said he should have ``special sympathy for China,'' where he
lived in 1974-75 as head of the U.S. liaison office.
   Ms. Sadik, of Pakistan, said she also told the Chinese they
should work harder to improve the image of their family-planning
program.
   Chinese officials are striving to hold down a population of 1.1
billion, the largest in the world. Since 1980, they have tried to
enforce a one-child per couple policy.
   The policy has met some success in the cities but encountered
resistance in the countryside, where the return of family farming
has made it advantageous to have more children. Newly affluent
farmers are often willing to pay heavy fines imposed for giving
birth to two or more children.
   After dipping in the early 1980s, the rate of population growth
has begun to creep up again. Demographers estimate the population at
the end of the century will be about 1.28 billion, 80 million above
the original target.
   However, Sadik said African countries, many of which have just
begun family-planning programs, were hit hardest by the withdrawal
of U.S. funds.

   Italy will send $5 million to western and
northwestern Africa for the battle against a locust invasion that
threatens to spread into Arab and central Asian countries, the
Foreign Ministry said Friday.
   The bilateral project with the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization will include $2.96 million in aid to Sudan, where the
insects have hit crops the hardest, the ministry said.
   Italy has also earmarked $740,000 for Chad and $550,000 for
Ethiopia, according to the ministry.
   The funds will provide for planes and insecticide for aerial
spraying as well as ground-based equipment, the statement said.
   The locust problem has grown critical recently as the locust
swarms have chewed through crops and foliage in the famine-ridden
countries of Ethiopia and Sudan.
   International health experts have warned that locust swarms could
spread beyond Africa's Red Sea border into Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.

   Opponents of U.S. military bases
called off a rally planned Friday at the Subic Bay naval station
after troops stopped them at checkpoints and residents marched in
counterprotest.
   Shops closed and public transport came to a halt in Olongapo, the
city where the U.S.-run base in located. Mayor Richard Gordon spoke
of ``a people's strike in reverse.''
   ``They will be stretching their luck too far if they insist on
coming after five,'' he said of the protesters. ``I'm sorry for
them, but I'll have to send them back.''
   The opponents of the bases turned back to Manila after reaching
within 10 miles of the city because their rally permit expired at 5
p.m.
   At least 10,000 residents spilled onto the streets for boisterous
marches as riot police stood nearby. One group of several hundred
marched down a street with a band playing ``God Bless America.''
   Many people in this city of 150,000 depend on the base for their
living.
   The group of more than 2,000 activists who oppose any U.S.
nuclear weapons on Philippine territory planned to hold a rally at
the gates of the base in Olongapo.
   However, soldiers manning at least five checkpoints delayed the
group, prompting one protester, Sen. Josephine Valentinne of
Australia, to say the Philippines ``is a country being run by the
military.''
   ``We've come here with a peaceful mission,'' she said. ``We have
not come to upset anyone or to disturb the peace.''
   The soldiers said they were looking for weapons and infiltrators
from communist rebel or other groups.
   The rally at Olongapo would have been the second such
demonstration by the group in two days. On Thursday, after arriving
in a motorcade from Manila, the group marched toward the gates of
U.S.-run Clark Air Base about 30 miles from Olongapo. However, it
was blocked about 300 yards away by riot troops and thousands of
local residents supporting the base.
   The motorcade was organized by several groups opposed to the
bases.
   The United States maintains six military installations in the
Philippines, and their lease expires in 1991. The Philippine
government must approve any new one, and much opposition to the
bases has developed in the Congress and among the public.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It appears more likely that former Prime
Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants, who vanished from his home a week
ago, may be dead, a police official said Friday.
   Chief investigator Andre Vandoren told reporters that neither he
nor the family of Vanden Boeynants has heard anything more from a
group called the Revolutionary Socialist Brigade, which claimed to
hold the 69-year-old politician.
   The group said in a letter to two newspapers Tuesday it was
holding Vanden Boeynants for $770,000 ransom. He disappeared Jan. 14.
   ``I must conclude that we have no proof that a movement or people
that have made themselves known have indeed kidnapped Mr. Vanden
Boeynants,'' Vandoren said.
   When pressed by reporters to say whether he believed Vanden
Boeynants had been killed, Vandoren said ``murder was among the
possibilities from the start, but I must say it is now gaining
ground.''
   On Thursday, officials ruled out the possibility Vanden
Boeynants, 69, had staged his own disappearance.
   The Christian Democrat received a three-year suspended jail
sentence for tax evasion and fraud in 1986 as the head of a meat
packing business.
   He is under investigation for corruption when he was defense
minister in the 1970s.
   Vanden Boeynants disappeared after parking his car in a garage
near his apartment complex in Brussels. In the garage, police found
his pipe, a shoe and a hearing aid along with a syringe cap, leading
to speculation he may have been sedated.
   In addition to the Revolutionary Socialist Brigade, the extreme
left-wing Communist Combat Cells claimed responsibility for Vanden
Boeynants' disappearance.
   In 1984 and 1985, the group staged a bombing campaign against
business and NATO targets throughout Belgium. In October, four of
its members received life sentences in connection with those attacks.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968, and again
from late 1987 to early 1979. He served as defense minister for
seven years in the 1970s.
   He was also a Brussels alderman for more than 30 years beginning
in 1952, during which time he oversaw a drastic urban renewal
program that made him the bane of urban conservationists.
   The brigade's letter demanded that two-thirds of the ransom be
donated to the poor by several relief groups. The ransom was to be
provided by Vanden Boeynants' political and business associates.

<TEXT>
   Six-year-old Lisa Steinberg provided enough
circumstantial evidence ``from her grave'' to convict Joel Steinberg
of her murder, a prosecutor told the jury Friday.
   ``Although you never heard her voice, you never heard her speak
one word, she was the most powerful witness in this courtroom,''
Assistant District Attorney Peter Casolaro said in closing arguments.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, is accused by his
live-in companion, Hedda Nussbaum, of fatally beating their
illegally adopted daughter in 1987. The case is expected to go to
the jury on Monday.
   ``From her grave, she delivered circumstantial evidence which you
should use to convict her murderer, the man she believed was her
father, Joel Steinberg,'' said Casolaro. ``That evidence, and that
evidence alone, is sufficient for you to reach a verdict'' of guilty.
   The prosecutor said Steinberg told six versions of how Lisa
suffered some 20 bruises and five versions of the events on the
night she was fatally injured.
   Casolaro noted there were cuts and bruises on Steinberg's
knuckles when he was interviewed by police shortly after they
removed Lisa from the apartment.
   ``His failure to explain them is just as powerful as the fact
that they are there,'' said Casalaro, adding: ``There were no cuts
and bruises on Hedda Nussbaum's hands.''
   The prosecutor noted that Steinberg, after learning that Lisa was
probably brain dead, asked doctors ``What else is wrong with her?''
_ a statement defense lawyers called a nervous reaction of a
concerned parent.
   ``The question might better be phrased, `Did you find my knuckle
prints on the side of her head?''' Casolaro told jurors. ``That is
cold and uncaring and depraved.''
   On Thursday, defense lawyers giving their summation accused Ms.
Nussbaum of killing Lisa because she was jealous of the attention
Steinberg gave the girl.
   Ms. Nussbaum, her face disfigured from beatings allegedly
inflicted by Steinberg, was arrested with him, but charges against
her were dropped and she became the government's chief witness.
   Prosecutors said she had been too brutalized to help or hurt the
girl. For the past year, she has been in a psychiatric facility.

<TEXT>
   The White House changed presidents Friday _ but
not presidential spokesmen.
   Marlin Fitzwater, who was chief spokesman for Ronald Reagan and
now speaks for President Bush, has come full circle. And more.
   Fitzwater worked for Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential
campaign and in the press office during Reagan's first term. He
became the vice president's spokesman at the start of Reagan's
second term, but went back to work for Reagan in 1987.
   And now Fitzwater has gone back to work for Bush.
   Fitzwater sometimes found himself, as White House spokesman in
the waning weeks of the Reagan administration, straddling the fence
between present and future bosses.
   At a briefing for reporters on Reagan's 1990 budget proposal,
Fitzwater was inundated by questons about how Bush might alter it
after taking office.
   After parrying several questions, and more than a few quips about
mixed loyalties, Fitzwater declared, ``I speak for the president.''
That meant Ronald Reagan.
   Fitzwater referred questions about Bush to the president-elect's
transition office.
   The 46-year-old Fitzwater is a bald and stocky man known for his
sense of humor and a self-deprecating wit. A native of Abilene,
Kan., he has worked as a government public affairs spokesman for
more than 20 years, with stints at the Treasury Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Friday, Fitzwater accompanied Reagan to the Capitol for Bush's
swearing-in, then tarried while the new president had lunch inside
with several members Congress.
   Back at the White House, a picture of Bush and Fitzwater, taken
Nov. 28, the day Bush announced Fitzwater's appointment, went up on
the wall in the West Wing corridor leading to Fitzwater's office _
which was waiting, untouched, for his return.

   The Associated Press today began transmission
of a photograph of George Bush just 40 seconds after the new
president took his oath of office, saving nearly a half-hour by use
of a digital camera.
   The photo was made by AP staff photographer Ron Edmonds, using a
Nikon camera and shooting from a stand in front of the Capitol. The
camera captures the image on a disk in digital format. The picture
is immediately available for transmission; no film processing or
print-making is required.
   Once the picture of Bush was made, Edmonds inserted the disk into
a small transmitter at his position. At the touch of a button, the
transmission started and a telephone line carried it directly onto
the AP picture network and to U.S. newspapers.
   Photo transmission normally begins 30 minutes or more after the
photographer snaps the shutter, and after chemical processing.
   The high-speed picture was provided to meet the pressing
deadlines of evening newspapers. Digital pictures of this kind
usually are slightly less sharp than those from classic silver-film
cameras, but are adequate for newspaper reproduction in tight
deadline situations.

<TEXT>
   Poles picked up their Friday newspapers to
find the Communist Party advocating the legalization of Solidarity,
a radical about-face they greeted with surprise, hope and a dose of
skepticism.
   ``It is all just a big mess,'' said a 53-year-old printer on a
Warsaw street corner. ``I don't know if there is going to be
anything good of it at all. I am not a pessimist but I am not an
optimist either. Time will show.
   ``I am surprised, obviously, as they banned it here and now they
restore it,'' he said. ``It is just chaotic.''
   ``I am very happy myself,'' said an accountant. ``Perhaps
something will change for the better.''
   The official press has brought Poles hints of change during
recent months, including the first interviews with Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa since the East bloc's only independent trade union was
banned following the imposition of martial law in 1981.
   This week, official newspapers carried an unusual, frank
discussion of the heated debate during the party Central Committee
meeting and word that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had offered to resign
as head of state after running into stiff opposition to paving the
way for new political and union freedoms.
   On Friday, newspapers carried the party position paper that opens
the door to talks between the government and the opposition at which
legalization of Solidarity could be negotiated.
   And Walesa, whose illegal movement the government has tried to
eradicate for seven years, appeared answering questions about the
plan on the state-run television's evening news program.
   A commentary accompanying the party text in the daily Zycie
Warszawy called the decision ``an act of realism in perceiving
Polish realities.''
   Those realities include shortages from mattresses to medicine, a
decaying infrastructure and inflation as rampant as people's
cynicism.
   ``We'll live and see,'' said a Warsaw electronic technician. ``It
is certainly good and the situation should get better. But we will
see. As you know, it has been like this many times.''
   At the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk where Solidarity was born, the
legalization offer was the ``No. 1 topic of comment,'' said Edward
Fzajkiewicz, deputy chairman of the Solidarity committee.
   He proclaimed workers ``100 percent'' behind Walesa.
   ``The reds too,'' chimed in another worker, referring to the
party members at the plant.
   ``They all have a general feeling that they finally gave way,''
Fzajkiewicz said. ``Doubts have to be taken into consideration but I
think the sides are condemned to come to agreement.''
   Walesa said he is willing to start talks with the government if
other Solidarity leaders agree during weekend meetings. He discussed
the situation during a shipyard rally after which one worker called
the government offer ``a big step.''
   ``But it should be cut and dried,'' he said. ``(They're saying)
maybe they'll give you this much and that much, and maybe nothing.
And maybe they are again preparing truncheons from above. It could
be a trick.''
   Party members interviewed on state radio also were cautious.
   ``The question is often repeated concerning safeguards,
conditions which would not allow that the year 1981 could be
repeated,'' said one.
   In Warsaw, the electronic technician recalled the 1980-81 period,
too.
   ``We are certainly worse off economically now,'' he said, but on
the other hand it is better that ``we can talk like now and we are
not afraid.''
   He added that he has been surprised since he saw government
spokesman Jerzy Urban discussing Solidarity on TV. ``Urban ...
previously would spit on Walesa and now he says `Mr. Walesa,''' he
said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some 200,000 people assembled Friday on what
President Bush called ``democracy's front porch'' for a chilly,
firsthand look at inaugural history.
   ``A little crazy and a little blue ticket will get you here,''
said Carlos Vasquez of Antioch, Calif., one of the first to surge
forward when makeshift gates on the Capitol's West Front were opened
to standing-room ticketholders.
   ``It was like they were giving food away,'' said Tara Scully of
Washington.
   ``No. Money,'' said Lyndsey Smith, also of Washington.
   Red, white, blue and fur were the hallmarks of the windswept
bicentennial inauguration. Bunting and flags were draped all over
the Capitol facade, and the U.S. Marine Band sat below the podium in
bright red uniforms.
   One spectator, Occidental Petroleum lobbyist Bob Robertson, made
ink sketches on a yellow pad in preparation for a more elaborate
watercolor he would paint at home. ``I just want to get the flavor
of it,'' he said.
   The weather started out so warm and sunny that one young man
closed his eyes and tilted his head into the sun, catching tanning
rays as he listened to the patriotic musical prelude performed by
the marine band and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
   It turned cooler later, but not as severely as in 1984 when
bitter cold forced Ronald Reagan to move his swearing-in indoors.
   At Friday's event, thick clouds accompanied by a cutting wind
rolled in about 90 minutes before the ceremonies began. The young
members of the military color guard had to fight their way out of
the flags furling around their heads. And as the sun disappeared,
the furs came out.
   In the diplomatic spouses section of the audience, nearly every
wife appeared to be wearing mink. Others were more daring. Betty
Wright, wife of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, wore a short,
spotted fur as she sat in a conspicuous place of honor on the
balustrade. And Monica Zunt of Cleveland sported a huge gray fur hat
adorned with a dozen brown feathers.
   ``I figure, where else can I wear it?'' said Zunt. ``It's the
official inaugural hat.''
   Gary Wetzel, snapping pictures of the U.S. Marine Band, wore a
black T-shirt adorned with his medal of honor. ``I'm from Wisconsin.
This is spring weather,'' he said. Wetzel, who had only one arm,
said he was shot down in a helicopter in Vietnam ``and I saved a
bunch of guys.''
   Barbara Bush was wearing a turquoise coat and white gloves during
the ceremony, but Bush wore no overcoat or hat. During the Rev.
Billy Graham's invocation Bush was seen trying to plaster his hair
back off his forehead. And during his own speech, he stopped once to
wipe his nose with a handkerchief.
   ``We meet on democracy's front porch,'' Bush told the crowd,
before echoing his campaign themes of ``a thousand points of light''
and ``a kinder, gentler nation.''
   Officer Dan Nichols of the U.S. Capitol Police said about 200,000
people attended the swearing-in ceremony. He called it ``completely
trouble free. No arrests, no incidents and no medical emergencies.''
   Some people on the lawn were diehard Republicans who had made
arrangements months in advance to attend the inauguration. But for
others it was a spur-of-the-moment affair: a brother who couldn't
come in from Richmond, Va.; a condo neighbor who offered three
spares on Thursday. And one woman said she got her ticket from the
man to whom she sold her house.
   Many said they had come only for the ceremony and would reserve
judgment on Bush.
   ``It's a gentler, kinder nation, so we're open-minded,'' said Ed
Rogers, a Washington lawyer. ``It's a little early to tell yet,''
added his colleague, Leslie Turner.
   One Democrat, Ann Giesecke, an employee of the Environmental
Protection Agency, acknowledged that she felt ``a little sadness''
at the occasion. But Margaret McArthur of Fayetteville, N.C.,
sitting next to Giesecke, had no such qualms.
   ``I'm for him 100 percent,'' she said of Bush. ``I might be
sitting in the Democratic section, but I'm a Republican.''
   McArthur said she was attending one of two youth balls Friday
night. She's 55.

<TEXT>
   As Ronald Reagan headed for the plane that
would carry him off to California, a familiar voice shouted, ``How
about a word, Mr. President? How about a word?''
   As usual, Reagan responded with a grin and shrug.
   It was likely to be the last time ABC correspondent Sam Donaldson
would shout at Reagan _ in Washington, at least. Donaldson got on
the plane with the former president to cover his arrival in
California later.
   When Reagan left the White House Friday morning, Donaldson left,
too, after 12 years as ABC's chief White House correspondent. He had
frequently said in the past that he was going to leave but finally
did it after Reagan.
   ``I'm going out with no regrets,'' he said Thursday. ``And it's a
pleasure they're not carrying me out feet first and not pushing me
out, but I'm going of my own will.''
   Brit Hume took over the job as of noon Friday with the
inauguration of George Bush. Donaldson is expected to be named
co-anchor later this year of a new, prime-time ABC news program and
will continue to appear on ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Before getting on the plane, Donaldson noted to ABC anchorman
Peter Jennings that ABC, too, was undergoing a changing of the guard.
   ``I'm history, like Ronald Reagan,'' he said.
   ``I hope I haven't upset too many of President Carter or
President Reagan's partisans,'' Donaldson said, a reference to his
reputation as the most aggressive member of the White House press
corps.
   His habit of shouting questions at Reagan during ``photo
opportunities'' was often cited by critics as an example of an
arrogant and disrespectful news media.
   Donaldson said again Thursday he shouted questions only when
there was no other way to get an answer.
   ``To talk to Jimmy Carter, except in the last few months of his
presidency when he hunkered down over the hostage crisis, he was
available,'' Donaldson said. ``For Reagan, the alternatives were go
for months or speak out. And if, as they always did in public keep
him 50 yards away, to speak out meant you had to raise your voice.''
   He thought his successor might have an easier time of it. ``I
trust from what we know about him, no one's going to have to yell at
George Bush,'' Donaldson said.
   If Reagan's supporters were irked by Donaldson, the White House
staff seemed to take him in stride. The final White House news
summary under the Reagan administration included a reprint of a
cartoon from The (Memphis) Commercial Appeal depicting a smiling
Reagan in a T-shirt inscribed, ``I survived Donaldson.''

<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Canterbury prayed Friday for the
safe return of his envoy, Terry Waite, who vanished in Beirut two
years ago while trying to negotiate the release of foreigners held
hostage in Lebanon.
   David Waite said he believed his 49-year-old brother would be
freed this year, and British officials expressed optimism Waite and
other British hostages are alive, although there has been no
physical evidence of that.
   The leftist Beirut daily As-Safir said four of the 15 foreign
hostages were moved from a jail near the city to a new location, but
it did not give further details in the unattributed report.
   ``To observe a second anniversary is a disappointment, but we
remain ever hopeful of his return,'' the Church of England's
spiritual leader, Robert Runcie, said in a nationally broadcast
sermon from a London church.
   ``We look with hope for the release of all hostages and those
unjustly imprisoned,'' he said.
   Waite's fate has been a mystery since he disappeared Jan. 20,
1987 after leaving the Riviera Hotel in west Beirut, apparently to
meet with Shiite Moslems holding some American hostages. It was his
fifth mission to Lebanon.
   In the previous 17 months, the 230-pound, 6-foot-7 church envoy
had been credited with obtaining freedom for three U.S. hostages.
   But Lebanese officials and some Western sources believe Waite's
prestige had been compromised by news that the Reagan administration
negotiated freedom for the Rev. Benjamin Weir, the Rev. Lawrence
Jenco and David Jacobsen by delivering U.S. weapons to Iran.
   No group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping Waite, British
journalist John McCarthy or Anglo-Irish teacher Brian Keenan, and
there have been no messages from them.
   Britain's ambassador in Beirut, Allan Ramsay, said the three
Britons are probably held in ``deplorable conditions, deprived of
freedom and most human contact.''
   ``There is nothing to suggest they are not alive,'' he was quoted
as saying by Britain's domestic news agency Press Association. ``We
have indications which confirm that, though nothing very recent.''
   He called on the kidnappers to release the captives.
   ``There is nothing to be gained by continuing to detain these
people a moment longer ... There are no bargains to be struck,''
Ramsay said in remarks published in Lebanese papers.
   Waite's brother said he was satisfied with official efforts to
gain Waite's release.
   ``We are still optimistic,'' he said. ``We believe Terry will be
back with us again before the next year goes by.''
   Islamic Jihad is the pro-Iranian Shiite faction holding Americans
Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the hostage held longest.
He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Sources said Waite was driven to the home of a Shiite physician,
where he was taken hostage.
   Hostages freed since then have reported seeing a burly man they
believed was Waite in an underground prison.
   Runcie had expressed concern to Waite about his decision to
travel to Beirut ``but was convinced by his determination to go,''
church spokeswoman Eve Keatley said Friday.
   Runcie asked God to help all hostages and to ``sustain them in
their loneliness, give them courage to face each new day with
hope.'' He also prayed for the ``ordinary people'' of Lebanon where
``suffering caused by hostage-taking has been known by so many
communities.''
   Iran's closest ally in Lebanon, Sheik Mohammed hussein Fadlallah,
was quoted as saying the issue of the foreign captives is ``now
frozen.'' Fadlallah is spiritual mentor of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, believed to be an umbrella organization for groups
holding hostages.
   The Middle East Reporter, an English-language newsletter, said
Fadlallah refused to comment further on the hostages.

<HEAD>Ailing President Reported Improving, Replacement Begins Duties</HEAD>

   Doctors said Friday that President
P.W. Botha was improving after a stroke, and his temporary
replacement presided over a high-level meeting about Namibia's
independence.
   A medical bulletin said the muscle weakness in Botha's left arm
and leg ``has improved markedly.''
   Botha was in a cheerful mood, received several visitors, and took
notes while reading the morning newspapers, according to Col. Rupert
Cloete, superintendent of No. 2 Military Hospital in the Cape Town
suburb of Wynberg.
   One newspaper said Botha, 73, will need at least a month to
recuperate from the stroke he suffered Wednesday. Another said
doctors are likely to tell him next week whether he can return to
work or should retire.
   Botha on Thursday named Constitutional Development Minister Chris
Heunis, the senior-ranking Cabinet member, to serve indefinitely as
acting president.
   Heunis and other Cabinet members met Friday in Cape Town with
members of Namibia's transitional Cabinet. South Africa, which has
ruled Namibia for 74 years, is to begin implementing independence in
the territory in April, leading to U.N.-supervised elections on Nov.
1.
   Heunis said the talks were ``frank and took place in a spirit of
mutual understanding.''
   He said discussions focused on how the current transitional
government will phase itself out of existence prior to April 1. The
multiracial Cabinet is made up of Namibians, but they are under
Louis Pienaar, a South African who serves as administrator general.
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said Botha would need at
least a month to recuperate. The Citizen report was based on
comments from ``an informed source in the government and a leading
neurosurgeon,'' who were not named.
   The Star, the country's largest daily, said without citing
sources that doctors ``will probably decide by next week whether
(Botha) will be fit enough to resume office ... or whether he should
retire.''

   Ronald Reagan turned one last time as he headed
out the Oval Office door Friday, casting his eyes about the room
with a melancholy look.
   ``Chills went through you,'' said a witness after watching the
nation's 40th president leave the historic office.
   Just two hours before he turned over the presidency to George
Bush, Reagan paid a sentimental visit to the spacious room in the
West Wing he'd used for eight years.
   Sunlight streamed through the lightly green-tinted, bulletproof
windows as Reagan met for one last time with his national security
adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell.
   ``The world is quiet today, Mr. President,'' Powell said,
offering Reagan his last assesment of the world's trouble spots.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who was present in the
Oval Office, said the last piece of paper the president signed was a
letter to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, thanking her for
her support.
   Reagan also left a handwritten note to Bush in his desk, wishing
him well, Fitzwater said.
   The room had been swept clean of Reagan's personal mementoes _
the pictures of his wife Nancy, children and friends that had
adorned the table behind his desk, the engraved crystal paperweights
and pens were atop it.
   In anticipation of Reagan's successor, the trappings of the
office remained _ the multibuttoned white telephone on the large,
wooden desk, the presidential and U.S. flags by the windows
overlooking the South Lawn.
   Reagan shook hands with the top aides who'd come to bid him
farewell and greeted the photographers who'd been invited to capture
the moment for history.
   ``Well, let's all line up for the picture,'' Reagan told them as
they gathered for a photo with the man they'd captured on film for
so many years.
   The president walked over to his desk, an ornately carved and
columned piece constructed from the timbers of the HMS Resolute. It
had been presented to President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1880 by Queen
Victoria.
   Reagan sat silently for a moment, then put his hands on the
desk's leather top, stood up and pushed his leather chair in place.
Head bowed, he headed for the door, but turned to cast one last,
sweeping look about the oval room before striding out the door.
   ``It was an incredible moment,'' said one of those present in the
room, who asked not to be quoted by name. ``Chills went through
you.''
   Then, for the last time, Reagan walked down the arched colonnade
toward the executive mansion. A small group of staff members and
journalists called farewells to him through the glass doors near the
Rose Garden.
   Softly calling out ``goodbye'' and lifting his arm in a brief
wave, Reagan turned and strode toward the mansion and out of sight.

<TEXT>
   George Bush sought in the lofty cadences of his
inaugural address to move finally from a partisan playing on
national divisions to a president governing a nation ``made whole.''
   Bush had said his speech would be scant on specifics. It was.
   Instead, he spoke of ``a moment rich with promise'' and offered
an often poetic expansion on the ``kinder, gentler'' themes he first
enunciated last August in accepting the Republican presidential
nomination.
   But in his vow to devote new attention to the homeless, the
disadvantaged, the forgotten, and the drug-addicted, he also sounded
a note of reality in a time of $100 billion-plus deficits.
   ``We have more will than wallet; but will is what we need,'' the
nation's 41st president told the nation.
   Bush's speech pulled together most of the humanitarian objectives
he touched upon in the presidential campaign but which were often
lost in the clamor of a race more remembered for bitter trench
fighting, questions of patriotism and Willie Horton.
   But, as if to put the scars of the campaign behind him, Bush also
appealed to bipartisanship in the conduct of domestic and foreign
affairs.
   ``The people await action,'' he said. ``They did not send us here
to bicker,'' The remarks seemed clearly directed at the leaders of
Capitol Hill.
   He talked about burying differences sharpened by the Vietnam War
and of a new harmony between the nation's ``great parties.''
   And, while promising a ``new breeze,'' he also sought to build on
the legacy of the Reagan administration of which he was a part for
eight years: championing open trade and free enterprise, trumpeting
the economic recovery and improved relations with the Soviets.
   It was a speech rich in metaphors. Bush used the image of an
outreached hand both to express an overture to peace _ at home and
abroad _ and to demonstrate a national resolve.
   ``We will stay strong to protect the peace,'' he said, adding
that ``the `offered hand' is a reluctant fist; once made, strong and
can be used with great effect.''
   If the language of Bush's inaugural address sounded similar to
his previous evocations of a ``kinder and gentler nation'' and a
``thousand points of light,'' it's no surprise.
   Friday's speech was written largely by Peggy Noonan, who also
wrote his convention acceptance speech, many of his less combative
campaign speeches and part of Reagan's farewell address to the
nation.
   Nor was it a surprise for the new president to talk eloquently of
cooperation with Congress, of mending fences, of presiding over a
nation without division. He has sounded such themes before.
   For Bush, the need for cooperation is more than just rhetoric.
   When Democrat Jimmy Carter was inaugurated, both chambers of
Congress were under the control of his own party. Ronald Reagan's
1980 landslide victory also delivered the Senate into Republican
hands.
   But Bush takes the helm with both the House and the Senate in
Democratic hands and with the battle over budget priorities likely
to be the first test of his infant leadership.
   It is a political reality of which Bush was mindful. ``There is
much to do,'' he declared, ``and tomorrow the work begins.''
   Tomorrow, perhaps, he will take comfort in the comments of David
Bonior, a Democratic congressman from Michigan:
   ``The tone of the president's address was conciliatory and
hopeful. Congress will respond very positively to Bush's efforts to
reach out and unite the country. He set forth a modest, yet humane
vision for the coming years. It was a good kickoff to a new era.''

   Riot police dispersed crowds that
gathered Friday to hold a sixth day of demonstrations, and the
government denounced calls for greater freedom.
   Police threatened violence but did not use it on the would-be
protesters in Wenceslas Square in central Prague that since Sunday
had been the site of daily demonstrations.
   The unrest marked the most sustained display of dissatisfaction
with the government since the Soviet invasion in 1968.
   The worst violence of the week came Thursday, when at least nine
people were injured as hundreds of police with truncheons charged a
crowd of more than 2,000 people calling for a free press, free
elections and freedom of assembly.
   Several dozen people were arrested Thursday, according to the
official media. Activists said at least 20 leading dissidents
remained held Friday.
   Activist Petr Uhl of the human rights group Charter 77 said Tomas
Hradilek, a spokesman for the movement, was detained Friday at work
in Lipnik nad Becvou in Moravia, about 180 miles east of Prague.
   Uhl said the detention meant that all three of Charter 77's
spokesmen were in custody. It appeared that Hradilek would be held
for 48 hours, he said.
   As soon as people began gathering Friday on Wenceslas Square,
police in vans circled the half-mile-long boulevard flanking the
square and said through bullhorns: ``Citizens, your gathering is
unlawful.''
   Police warned that riot police would move in if crowds did not
disperse.
   Fifteen minutes later, officers blocked side streets leading to
the top half of the square and formed a human cordon across its
center. Plainclothes and uniformed riot police jostled those
reluctant to disperse.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo, in a front-page editorial
Friday, denounced the unrest as an attempt to restore the democracy
that existed before the communist takeover in 1948.
   ``A return to the conditions of the bourgeois republic is ... out
of the question,'' the daily said. ``Let's emphasize this
unequivocally, no matter who dislikes it.''
   The unrest started Sunday with a rally to commemorate Jan Palach,
a student who committed suicide by setting himself afire in January
1969 to protest the 1968 invasion.
   Charter 77 planned a vigil Saturday at Palach's grave in the
village of Vsetaty, 18 miles north of Prague.
   Two police cars Friday were stationed on roads leading to the
village, and a plainclothes policeman at the entrance to the
cemetery said the area where Palach's urn was buried was closed. A
sign said the closure was for ``technical reasons.''
   In Prague, plainclothes police disrupted a report by an Austrian
television reported who was not allowed to finish the taping in
Wenceslas Square.
   The unrest reflects the desire of many Czechoslovaks for more
freedom and political reforms than the government has been willing
to accept.
   But the demonstrations also have made clear that the activists
are a minority in a society that, despite growing economic problems,
still has one of the highest standards of living in the East bloc.
   The official media has repeatedly blamed Charter 77 and other
independent groups for the unrest.
   Charter 77 member Anna Sabatova said several of the jailed
dissidents have been told they will be prosecuted.
   On Thursday, 15 former communists sent a letter to the
Czechoslovak government urging a halt to the ``media campaign''
against Charter 77. They also demanded the release of jailed
dissidents, said one of the signatories, former Foreign Minister
Jiri Hajek.

<HEAD>Israel Shuts Schools for 300,000 in West Bank, PLO Rejects Rabin
Plan</HEAD>

   Military authorities again shut all 1,200
schools in the West Bank on Friday, barely a month after they
reopened, in a renewed effort to quell violence in the 13-month
Palestinian uprising.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a Palestinan alleged to be an
Israeli collaborator was shot to death and another suspected
collaborator died of wounds suffered earlier. At least 15
Palestinians were reported wounded in clashes with soldiers.
   Most of the injuries occurred when troops fired on stone-throwing
protesters at three Gaza Strip refugee camps, Arab reporters said. A
12-year-old boy was reported shot in the leg when a clash erupted
after Moslem noon prayers in the West Bank city of Hebron.
   The army confirmed the two deaths and said it had reports of six
injured. At least 365 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the
revolt.
   The PLO and other Palestinians rejected a peace plan put forth by
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   The plan, which government officials said was Rabin's personal
idea, called for elections of Palestinian leaders in the occupied
territories followed by direct negotiations between Israel, Jordan
and the new Palestinian leadership.
   It mirrors Israeli proposals dating back to 1977, which the PLO
and other Palestinians have repeatedly turned down.
   Rabin said the future settlement could resemble a Swiss-style
confederation with an automomous Palestinian district within the
Jewish state.
   He called the potential Palestinian leadership ``our partners for
peace'' but added that Israel will wait until the Palestinian
uprising ends before holding elections, Israel TV reported.
   Hilmi Hanoun, mayor of Tulkarem in the West Bank, said the plan
was another attempt to replace the PLO with Israeli-controlled
leaders.
   ``We have got our leadership in the PLO and want to tell Mr.
Rabin that ... if he wants peace, he knows where to go,'' said
Hanoun.
   In Baghdad, PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdulrahman rejected the idea of
autonomy, saying the uprising ``opened the door wide for a real
peace based on complete Israeli withdrawal ... and the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state.''
   Rabin added one new detail Friday to a tougher policy against
Palestinian protesters introduced earlier in the week. Israel radio
quoted him as saying troops now will be able to shoot plastic
bullets at people blocking roads with stones, a favorite tactic in
the uprising.
   The closure of schools for 300,000 West Bank students was
announced by the army after an upsurge in violent protests that
authorities say often began in schoolyards.
   An official of the the West Bank military government, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the closure was indefinite but might
be reconsidered ``in a few days'' if protests stop.
   Schools in the West Bank were closed for 10 months before
reopening in December.
   The uprising is the most sustained since Israel captured the West
Bank and Gaza Strip from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   Most of the Palestinian victims died in clashes with soldiers,
but more than a dozen have been killed as suspected collaborators by
fellow Arabs.
   Two deaths of alleged collaborators were reported Friday.
   Ahmed Jeredat, 36, was killed by a shot in the face in the West
Bank village of Atil on Thursday night and 18-year-old Mohammed Irut
died Friday of wounds suffered in a shooting Jan. 12 in the central
market in Nablus, Arab reporters said.
   The reporters said Jeredat was a shopkeeper who cooperated with
the military government and Irut was from a family with links to
Israeli authorities in Nablus' Balata neighborhood.
   Army officials confirmed Jeredat's death and listed a Palestinian
from Balata who died of earlier wounds, but they did not have his
name.

   George Bush opened his presidency Friday with a
tribute to the man he served for eight years and a declaration of an
American mission: ``to make kinder the face of the nation and
gentler the face of the world.''
   He delivered an inaugural address of dedication and inspiration,
lacking any specific political agenda but calling on his countrymen
to rise above materialism and to engage in ``a new activism,
hands-on and involved, that gets the job done.''
   To the Democratic leaders of Congress, the new Republican
president said, ``I am putting out my hand to you.''
   To the world, he said, ``We offer new engagement and a renewed
vow: We will stay strong to protect the peace.''
   The speech drew glowing reviews from Democrats.
   ``Bush is extending the hand of friendship, and we intend to
extend ours in return,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine. The Democratic leader said he would respond to
the Bush address with a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday.
   ``He repeated the themes he's been stating since the election:
cooperation and conciliation,'' said House Majority Leader Thomas
Foley, D-Wash. ``It is all very well received, and Congress will
respond with an equal effort and attitude.''
   Jesse Jackson joined the chorus of praise, saying the speech was
``characterized by hope and by reaching out to the loyal
opposition.''
   Bush took the oath of office as the nation's 41st president at
three minutes after noon, his hand resting on two bibles _ one a
Bush family bible and the other used 200 years earlier when George
Washington took the same oath.
   The simple ceremony on the inaugural stand on the west front of
the U.S. Capitol took place before an audience that included former
rivals within his own party as well as the Democratic members of
Congress with whom he must work.
   Around the country and the world, millions watched the change of
power on television.
   Bush opened his inaugural address with a tribute to Ronald
Reagan, ``a man who had earned a lasting place in our hearts _ and
in our history.
   ``President Reagan, on behalf of our nation I thank you for the
wonderful things you have done for America.''
   The assembled crowd burst into applause. Bush turned away from
the microphone to face his predecessor and joined in the applause.
   As he moved on to set the tone for the start of his
administration, Bush described a nation ``in a peaceful and
prosperous time.'' He added, ``But we can make it better.''
   ``A new breeze is blowing,'' he said, ``and a world refreshed by
freedom seems reborn. ... A nation refreshed by freedom stands ready
to push on; there is new ground to be broken, and new action to be
taken.''
   The 64-year-old president questioned whether the nation had grown
too materialistic.
   ``We are not the sum of our possessions,'' he said. ``They are
not the measure of our lives. ... What do we want the men and women
who work with us to say when we are no longer there? That we were
more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to
ask if a sick child had gotten better, and stayed a moment to trade
a word of friendship.''
   ``America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high
moral purpose,'' he said. ``We as a people have such a purpose
today. It is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the
face of the world.''
   He cited the homelessness, drugs, crime and unwed mothers as
national problems.
   ``The old solution, the old way, was to think that public money
alone could end these problems,'' said Bush. ``But we have learned
that is not so. And, in any case, our funds are low. We have a
deficit to bring down. We have more will than wallet; but will is
what we need.''
   He reecalled a term he used in the acceptance speech he delivered
in August in New Orleans when he became the GOP nominee to succeed
Reagan _ ``a thousand points of light.''
   He said these were ``all the community organizations that are
spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good.''
   In his appeal for greater cooperation between the administration
and Congress, Bush said, ``Our great parties have too often been far
apart and untrusting of each other.'' He blamed the Vietnam war
which he said, ``cleaves us still.
   ``But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter century ago;
and surely the statute of limitations has been reached. This is a
fact: The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long
afford to be sundered by a memory.''
   In offering his hand to the Democratic leaders of Congress, Bush
cited the need to reach a budget compromise and said, ``Let us
negotiate soon _ and hard. But in the end, let us produce.''
   He told other nations that ``the offered hand is a reluctant
fist; but the fist, once made, is strong and can be used with great
effect.''
   The new president concluded his inaugural address by saying, ``I
do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our
problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are
great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's
love is truly boundless.''
   After bidding goodbye to the Reagans, Bush, in his first act as
president, signed a proclamation making Sunday a National Day of
Prayer and Thanksgiving and the nominations for his Cabinet and
other high-level jobs.
   He distributed a handful of the the pens he used to the
congressional leaders who joined him and saved the remainder for the
nominees.
   The ceremony, attended by first lady Barbara Bush, took place in
the ornate President's Room where Lincoln signed the mancipation
Proclamation and former President Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964
Civil Rights Act.
   As he was leaving, Bush was asked about parting from Reagan.
   ``I was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks.
After eight years of friendship, it was pretty tough,'' Bush said.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, took a
page from President Carter's book Friday when, to the delight of
thousands of spectators, they jumped out of their armor-plated
limousine and walked part of the inaugural parade route.
   A squeal went up from the crowd lining Constitution Avenue at the
start of the parade as the First Couple emerged from their car
nearly half a block after leaving the Capitol, prompting some
parade-watchers to run after the motorcade.
   The Bushes, walking behind the limousine in the middle of the
street, waved robustly and the crowds returned the salute with
gusto, shouting enthusiastically. Secret Service agents walked
alongside the Bushes, but did not block the crowd's view.
   The Bushes returned to the car after about two blocks along
Constitution, but then they got out again as the parade moved up
Pennsylvania Avenue.
   They walked with long, fast strides, waving and smiling gleefully
before they returned to the car at 13th Street and Pennsylvania,
where thousands were gathered at a plaza known as Freedom Square.
Police estimated the total parade crowd at 300,000.
   The Bushes stepped out of the vehicle one last time when it
arrived at the White House, and Mrs. Bush, followed by her husband,
dashed into the crowd. They remained for only a few moments before
returning to the street to walk the final half-block to the
reviewing stand filled with many of the new president's friends and
contributors.
   In 1977, Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, walked nearly the entire
1{-mile parade route.
   Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary, said in a recent interview
that Carter told him about his plans the week before the
inauguration, but the news was ``very tightly held, for security
purposes.''
   ``What he told me at the time was the deal was the Secret Service
wasn't going to fight it as long as it was kept secret, but if word
got out ahead of time, they'd be very opposed to it,'' Powell said.
   Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams said earlier this week that
the agents would be prepared to protect Bush if he decided to stroll
rather than ride, but he admitted that the agents would not be too
happy about it.
   ``If we had our way, he would not leave the White House,'' Adams
said.
   The agent had refused to disclose whether Bush might be planning
such a jaunt.
   Contacted Friday while the parade was in progress, Adams said,
``Guess he's doing it!''
   He said he was not told whether the Bushes' walk had been
discussed with the Secret Service in advance and that he did not
know if the detail protecting the Bushes had been told.
   ``We're prepared for that, anticipating him getting out of the
vehicle, and as you can see, it became reality,'' he said.
   Security for the inaugural ceremonies at the Capitol was tight,
with sharpshooters deployed on nearby rooftops, U.S. Capitol Police
Officer Dan Nichols said.
   Some 200,000 people were on the Capitol grounds _ 142,000 with
tickets to the ceremonies and 60,000 lining the streets _ but there
were no problems and no arrests, Nichols said.
   All 142,000 who viewed the ceremonies were checked with a
magnetometer, and handbags and cameras were scrutinized carefully by
uniformed Secret Service agents. Some larger pieces that could not
be given a thorough inspection visually were examined by canine
explosive detection teams which had swept the entire area before the
ceremonies began, Nichols said.
   None of the people being subjected to security checks objected,
he said, adding, ``The crowds seem to be very receptive.
   ``Because of the day and age and how security is, people become
accustomed to these kind of checks,'' he said. ``I don't think
people mind at all. It gives them a sense of security. I'm sure they
can feel more at ease knowing everyone around them has been
screened.''

   Lech Walesa said Friday the Communist
Party's offer to legalize Solidarity doesn't go far enough, but he's
willing to talk with the government because Poland ``needs it so
badly.''
   ``Seeing all the needs and necessities, I will try to do
everything on my side to begin talks about Poland at the round table
as soon as possible,'' Walesa said after a 90-minute rally with
hundreds of workers inside the Gdansk shipyard where the Soviet
bloc's only independent trade union was founded in 1980.
   Walesa emphasized that the union's official position must await a
weekend meeting of the Solidarity National Executive Commission.
   ``I will reach toward agreement. I don't know if I will make it
but I will try,'' he said. ``I will want to take advantage of all
chances for agreement for Poland because we need it so badly. Time
really presses us.''
   After a stormy two-day session of the party Central Committee,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski on Thursday announced conditions could be
negotiated to reinstate Solidarity, which has been banned since
martial law was imposed in 1981.
   The government's dramatic change in course, contained in a
position paper allowing for political and trade union freedoms,
appears to be an effort to bring the opposition into the battle to
reverse the economic decline that has left Poland with chronic
shortages, a mounting foreign debt and a dispirited populace.
   Walesa noted the nation's deepening troubles, saying ``in
connection with all that it is more difficult that in 1980 to do
everything.''
   ``But we also have gained some experience,'' he continued. ``I am
an optimist, although we will face very difficult things.''
   Walesa said the legalization offer is a ``Band-Aid,'' with the
party going only as far as it had to due to the pressing crisis but
no further.
   ``It is very much (of a change) for the party. I repeat, very
much,'' he said. ``But as it goes for social expectations, it is a
little bit too little ... You may say it is only what is necessary
for today ... It is like a Band-Aid for today.''
   Jaruzelski said the offer was ``honest'' and represented a
``momentous event'' for Poland.
   The party position was printed in newspapers nationwide Friday
and Jaruzelski's Thursday news conference was broadcast on radio and
television. There also were short reports on Walesa's views.
   Under the government proposal, new unions must obey the law and
accept no financial support from the West. The resolution does not
contain a timetable for legalization or call on new unions to
refrain from striking, but party leaders have suggested a two-year
trial period with no strikes.
   Alfred Miodowicz, head of the only legal trade union alliance,
warned Friday that rank-and-file workers are not ready for the
changes and said they could result in unrest at factories.
   ``The situation is very tense in the country and I think we are
facing very serious events in enterprises,'' he said.
   However, although he voted against the party proposal at the
Central Committee meeting, he appeared resigned to having more than
one union at work places.
   ``I think this is the best solution because people in enterprises
know how to organize themselves,'' he said.
   A commentary in the Warsaw daily Zycie Warszawy said ``Poland is
entering a qualitatively new state of transformations of her
political system.''
   A factory party committee leader interviewed on the radio said
the new course was received poorly by ``a lot or even a majority of
comrades'' but that he expected views to change after discussions.
   Jaruzelski said the government is ready to start discussions it
proposed during an August wave of strikes, the worst in seven years.
Legalization of Solidarity has been a condition for the banned
union's participation.
   Jaruzelski said that as long as Solidarity respected the law of
the socialist state, the other details of legalization could be
negotiated during the talks.
   Walesa said Friday he was checking ``technical matters''
concerning the talks and legalization, in addition to preparing for
discussions with the executive commission, known by its Polish
initials KKW, ``so that we can reach agreement in order to solve
problems.''
   ``There's minimal things that are big for some and small for
others,'' he said. ``I can't speak for the KKW but I personally will
do everything possible to take advantage of these chances.''
   Walesa addressed workers in a dining hall at the Lenin shipyard,
where he returned to his job as an electrician this week following a
disability leave.
   When a worker asked Walesa how he could believe the authorities
after 40 years of lying and cheating, he replied, ``Of course, I
could shout: `Hang the communists.' I am capable of doing it, but
that is not the point. I am here to solve with you different
problems of the shipyard and the country.''
   ``I don't trust them (authorities) either, but if someone gives
me a chance for pluralism, I take this chance,'' Walesa added.
   ``If we are really getting economic, social and political
pluralism ... it would mean breaking down the monopoly and that's
the point,'' he said.
   The rally lasted longer than expected because workers had many
questions not only about the legalization offer, but also about
their futures under a government plan to liquidate the yard as
unprofitable.

   While George Bush was sworn in as president Friday,
a subdued Michael Dukakis watched on television, eating a tuna
sandwich and sharing his disappointment with his staff.
   ``I'd be less than candid if I didn't say I'd like to be the guy
raising his hand and taking the oath of office today,'' Dukakis said.
   The Massachusetts governor, who was faulted for his impersonal
campaign style, showed little emotion on inauguration day other than
to acknowledge that he felt disappointed. ``It's his day,'' Dukakis
said.
   Dukakis _ who has not ruled out another White House run in 1992 _
credited Bush with ``a good speech.'' The defeated Democrat said he
sensed Bush was ``reaching out'' to Democrats and welcomed Bush's
attention to the problems of drug abuse and homelessness.
   In a telegram sent to the White House on Friday, Dukakis offered
congratulations and best wishes.
   ``I am sure that other members of my party were touched as I was
by the sense of optimism, the call to duty and the generosity of
spirit by which you called on all of us in your inaugural address to
work together to eradicate homelessness, wipe out the scourge of
drugs that poisons our children and build a stronger, more secure
America,'' Dukakis wrote.
   Talking to reporters afterward, Dukakis said he felt proud of the
American political system for its stability and orderly transition
to a new administration.
   ``I wish him well and look forward to working with him,'' the
governor said. ``One of the great things about this system of ours
is the transfer of power peacefully.''
   Dukakis, who was invited to the inaugural ceremonies, said he
chose not to attend because he had work to do in Massachusetts,
where the $11.6 billion budget is at least $600 million out of
balance.

   Exiled Ugandan dictator Idi Amin has
dropped out of sight since leaving his home in Saudi Arabia two
weeks ago and may be hiding in Zaire, Arab diplomatic sources said
Friday.
   The sources said on condition of anonymity that they believed
Amin still was in Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire. They had no
information on reports that he left for the Saudi port of Jiddah on
Wednesday.
   ``The report that Amin left Kinshasa has not been confirmed, and
we believe he is still there... To the best of our knowledge, Amin
has not returned to Jiddah,'' said an Arab diplomat reached by
telephone in the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
   The former Ugandan leader has lived in Saudi Arabia since his
overthrow in 1979. Amin, 61, first arrived in Zaire Jan. 3 on a
false passport. He was expelled on Jan. 12 to Dakar, Senegal. From
there, he was expected to be returned to Saudi Arabia, but ended up
on a flight back to Zaire.
   The diplomat said Saudi officials were angry with Amin for
leaving the country on forged travel documents and refused him
re-entry into the country.
   He said the former dictator long has been unpopular with his
Saudi hosts for meddling in African politics and for his links with
Ugandans opposed to the current government there.
   In past telephone calls from Jiddah to The Associated Press
bureau in Bahrain, Amin made it clear he hoped to recapture power
with the help of supporters and relatives in Uganda.
   Amin was ousted from his East African nation in April 1979 and
was granted political asylum in Saudi Arabia in 1980 after the
Libyan government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi refused to harbor him.
   During eight years of tyranny, tens of thousands of Amin's
political opponents were killed, and newspaper reports alleged that
he practiced cannibalism. The reports were never independently
verified.
   Saudi businessmen acquainted with Amin said they had no idea of
his whereabouts but insisted he has not returned to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Even if he gets back to Saudi Arabia it will be quite a while
before we and the Africans here know about it,'' said one Jiddah
businessman who identified himself only as a close friend of the
Amin family.
   Saudi officials could not be reached for comment because of the
Moslem Sabbath on Friday.
   ``Idi Amin's whereabouts are becoming a mystery. ... Officials
are tight-lipped, and there is no stir in the African community and
Asian diplomatic circles here,'' said a Jiddah hotel manager who
said Amin used to visit him regularly.
   The hotel manager said Amin left Jiddah with one of his sons and
that his second wife and 22 other children still were in their
guarded villa halfway between Jiddah airport and the city.

<HEAD>Doctors Delay Birth Of Second Twins 12 Days</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Aaron and Joshua Landez are twins who will
celebrate their birthdays 12 days apart.
   The brothers, who were in good condition Friday at Humana Women's
Hospital, were born separately when doctors decided Joshua needed
more development in the womb following his brother's birth more than
two months prematurely on Jan. 5.
   ``To have one baby and still be pregnant sounds like a (National)
Enquirer headline,'' said the twins' mother, Norma Landez. But after
Aaron was born, she said, ``I could tell (Joshua) was growing more
quickly.''
   Aaron weighed only 2 pounds, 6 ounces at birth and had to be
placed on a respirator. Doctors, concerned about the development of
the other baby's lungs, used surgery and medication to delay
Joshua's birth until Tuesday.
   He weighed 3 pounds, 7{ ounces at birth.
   ``They decided that it was best for him inside the mom,''
hospital spokeswoman Cathy Collier said. ``Those extra 12 days ...
enabled him to be born without a respirator.''
   Both babies were delivered naturally, doctors said.
   ``We have seen a few hours go by between first birth and the
second, but we have never seen days go by _ and I've been practicing
for 20 years,'' said Dr. Melvin Baden, the newborn specialist caring
for the twins.
   However, Dr. Mark Paine, Landez's obstetrician, said the
procedure was being used more frequently in Europe, where twins have
been delivered as much as five weeks apart.
   The infants are expected to remain in the hospital another week
or two until they weigh at least 4 pounds, 8 ounces each.

   Two men were convicted Friday of stealing
donated corneas and selling for as much as $1,300 a pair. Jurors
acquitted their wives.
   Robert and Irene Fisher and Robert and Gailya Grant were accused
of misrepresenting themselves as members of a non-profit eye bank in
order to gain access to cadavers in medical examiners' offices,
hospitals and funeral homes.
   The couples sent corneas taken from the cadavers to research
facilities in the United States and abroad to Argentina and Saudia
Arabia, authorities said.
   Grant and Fisher were convicted of conspiracy and grand theft.
They face up to a year in jail at sentencing Feb. 24. Their lawyers
said they would appeal.
   The couples founded University Ophthalmic Services Inc. in 1986
and closed it a year later after the Florida Regional Bone and
Tissue Bank Inc. discovered they were removing corneas from corpses
and keeping the fees for delivering them.
   Defense attorneys maintained their clients simply recognized a
loophole in the law, set up a legitimate eye bank, retrieved corneas
that likely would have been discarded and capitalized on the need
for eye tissue in foreign countries.

   An enthusiastic cast of thousands stepped out
Friday to escort George Bush up America's main street to his new
home at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in an inaugural parade that gave
top billing to groups from Texas and Indiana.
   The newly sworn-in president and Vice President Dan Quayle,
sandwiched in in the midst of an impressive military escort, led off
the promenade with their wives and periodically jumped from their
limousines to stride the street and gleefully wave to the crowds.
   Once they'd completed the 1.6-mile parade route, the couples
viewed the rest of the pageantry from the best seats on the avenue _
an elaborate reviewing stand on the front lawn of the executive
mansion. Honored guests Bob Hope and Chuck Yeager, who arrived
aboard the first float, joined them shortly thereafter.
   The parade featured bands, military units, floats, dance groups
and equestrian teams from the 50 states, five U.S. territories and
the District of Columbia.
   But an abundance of groups from Texas and Indiana _ the home
states of Bush and Quayle, respectively _ led the pack.
   The Lone Star entries included Parson's Mounted Cavalry, a ROTC
unit from Texas A&amp;M complete with 75mm gun carriage and covered
wagon. A six-member broom and shovel brigade provided a comic
appendage.
   As a Texas float and the University of Texas Longhorn Band passed
the reviewing stand, George Bush Jr. donned a 10-gallon hat to
demonstrate his allegiances.
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, were more excited by the Hoosier
entries, clapping and waving as the Huntingon North High School
marching band from the vice president's home town played ``As the
Saints Go Marching In.''
   Another Indiana entry was the Marion County Sheriff's Precision
Motorcycle Drill Squad _ 17 officers who deftly maneuvered their
Harley Davidsons.
   From the starting float, with its giant U.S. flag, to the
parade's final entry _ the 320-member Mormon Tabernacle Choir
crammed onto a 100-foot flatbed truck _ the accent was heavy on
patriotism, peace and prosperity.
   Other entries ran the gamut: Alaska sent 47 Eskimo Scouts in
beaver headgear; Miss Rodeo Colorado was on hand; Virginia offered
the ``Old Tom'' Model-T fire truck; the Boy Scouts of America were
represented by 40-foot-high Popeye balloon.
   For the 300,000 common folk, standing room and tree limbs were
available; thousands of reserved bleacher seats sold for $12.50 to
$100.
   Marcia Little and Dean Brundage, a retired educator from suburban
Virginia, had another idea. They cantered into the city and had a
horse-top view over the seven-deep throngs.
   ``You have to be an NBA center to see over this crowd,'' Brundage
said.
   For Edward Dees, a 61-year-old black Republican from New York
City, just being near the start of parade route was enough.
   ``When I see George Bush roll down the street as the 41st
president, it makes me feel good all over,'' he said.
   And the interest was bipartisan.
   ``I'm not really a Republican,'' confessed 17-year-old William
Merkle of Woodbridge, Va. ``I just came to see all the hype and
hysteria. I've never been to something like this.''
   Pockets of demonstrators aired their dissenting views along the
parade route, with chants and signs such as ``Keep Abortion Legal''
and ``ERA Yes.''
   Four Washington women marched behind the crowds with signs
protesting the extravagance of the day's festivities.
   Three of the women wore rubber masks of Ronald and Nancy Reagan
and George Bush. One woman commented, ``This is pretty much like a
coronation in a monarchy. The only difference is George Bush isn't
Ronald Reagan's son.''
   The bustling avenue and mild temperatures were a sharp contrast
to the festivities of four years earlier, when frigid temperatures
forced the cancellation of the inaugural parade for only the second
time in history.
   The inaugural parade evolved from what originally was a
ceremonial escort of the newly sworn-in president from the Capitol
to his new digs at the White House.
   As the processions got more and more elaborate, they took on a
life of their own. This year's extravaganza involved more than
10,000 marchers, float-riders and equestrian units. And there were
another 10 bands performing at fixed sites along the parade to
entertain spectators during the lulls.
   The procession started about 45 minutes late, prompting some
creative cheers from the anxious crowds. On Constitution Avenue, the
cry was ``Where's George,'' a play on the slogan that Democrats
coined at their convention this summer.
   At another point, spectators on the two sides of Pennsylvania
Avenue chanted back and forth, ``tastes great'' and ``less
filling,'' the punch lines from a beer commercial.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Seized In Church Is Deported From Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sri Lankan whose illegal stay in Britain was
ended by a police raid on his church refuge flew out of Britain on
Friday, deported to his homeland.
   Police said they arrested seven protesters during a noisy
demonstration at Gatwick airport near London as Vijay Mendis, 32,
was deported on the 12:45 p.m. Air Lanka flight to Colombo.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the
Church of England, told his flock to obey the law after Home
Secretary Douglas Hurd told the church to be cautious about
sheltering people who were breaking it.
   In a statement from his Lambeth Palace official residence, Runcie
said it was regrettable that Hurd authorized the forcible removal of
Mendis from the church but that Parliament had abolished the legal
right of sanctuary in churches in 1623.
   The cleric said many people in the Anglican state church were
uneasy about Britain's immigration policy, but ``however
objectionable a particular law may be, everyone in a democracy must
obey it or accept the consequences of disobeying it.''
   Hurd, who is responsible for police and immigration, spoke to the
House of Commons hours after police smashed into a vestry of the
Church of the Ascension in the northern city of Manchester to seize
Mendis on Wednesday.
   Mendis had lived in the vestry since 1986 to resist deportation
and was looked after by well-wishers. He arrived in Britain in 1973
as a student.
   Mendis belongs to Sri Lanka's Buddhist Sinhalese majority. Hurd
rejected his claim that he faces persecution or death for his
political support for communism and the minority Tamils, most of
whom are Hindus.
   Tamil extremists have been fighting government forces for a
separate nation in the north of the island nation off southeast
India.
   Mark Brown, spokesman for the Mendis defense campaign, said he
saw Mendis in prison Thursday night and Mendis told him: ``Make no
mistake _ if I die, it was Douglas Hurd who pulled the trigger.''
   In Colombo, Foreign Ministry Secretary W. T. Jayesinghe said, ``I
don't think anything is going to happen to Mendis when he arrives.''
   West Germany's London embassy said the state of Bremen was ready
to accept Mendis. Proceedings were not completed in time, however,
and the Home Office said its noon deadline for a firm undertaking by
another country was not met.
   More than 1,000 campaigners to keep Mendis here sat down in the
center of Manchester Friday night, bringing commuter traffic to a
halt.

   Hundreds of protesters took to the streets as
George Bush took the oath of office Friday, demanding changes in
administration policies toward women, the homeless, minorities and
foreign affairs.
   Nearly 1,000 feminists wearing buttons that lighted up to read,
``Keep Abortion Legal,'' were scattered through the parade crowd of
some 300,000 people.
   Several of these National Organization for Women demonstrators
raised large round signs saying ``ERA Yes'' and ``Keep Abortion
Legal'' when Bush and his wife, Barbara, emerged from their
armor-plated limousine for a brief stroll along the parade route.
   ``George Bush can't get to the White House without knowing there
are a lot of us who feel very strongly about our constitutional
rights,'' said NOW President Molly Yard.
   The demonstration was prompted by the Justice Department's
request that the Supreme Court consider a Missouri case that could
overturn the Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   ``That was an alarm bell to us,'' she said. ``The plan is to put
pressure on the Bush admininstration, Congress and the Supreme Court
that we will not go back to the days of illegal abortions, they must
not overturn Roe vs. Wade, and we do want the Equal Rights
Admendment in the Constitution.''
   Meanwhile, members of the Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a
People's Agenda _ a coalition of 80 groups ranging from the Gray
Panthers to Environmental Action to the Committee in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador _ distributed thousands of leaflets
calling for new administration policies.
   Four Washington women _ three wearing rubber masks of Ronald and
Nancy Reagan and George Bush _ marched along the Pennsylvania Avenue
sidewalk wearing signs protesting the extravagance of the day's
festivities and contrasting it to the nation's needs to address the
problems of the homeless, AIDS and other social programs.
   ``This is pretty much like a coronation in a monarchy,'' said Amy
Barehr. ``The only difference is George Bush isn't Ronald Reagan's
son.''
   One of the women, Stephanie Hoffner, said that while some people
in the crowd cheered them, others shouted that the four should ``go
to Russia.''
   Other protesters carried signs with slogans such as ``1,000
Sparks of Dissent,'' ``Be a Good Buy, George,'' and others referring
to Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   They shook their fists and jeered as the Bushes moved by in their
car, but their shouts were mostly drowned out by cheers.
   Demonstrator Philip Moses of Arlington, Va., carried a sign
saying ``No U.S. $$ for Death Squad Government in El Salvador,'' as
he stood by a subway station jammed with hundreds of people who had
just witnessed the inauguration.
   ``We've had a fair amount of positive response, people saying,
`We're glad you're here,''' said Moses.
   But there were some dissenters.
   ``Is it OK to have Soviet death squads?'' taunted one passerby.
   ``We want no death squads,'' Moses replied.
   ``The Soviets do have a death squad, you know,'' the man said.
``They don't need a reason, they just shoot,'' he added as he
boarded the escalator to the subway.
   Another inaugural attendee shouted at a reporter: ``Don't
interview that turkey.''
   The coalition, which demands ``dignity for all people,'' called
for all people to ``have the right to adequate food, housing,
clothing and quality health care and education.'' In addition, the
coalition calls for a clean environment, the right to a safe, legal
abortion, no discrimination against minority groups including people
with AIDS.
   ``Finally, we demand a government responsive to the needs of the
people and the planet rather than corporate and military
interests,'' the leaflet says.
   Members of the coalition plan to demonstrate Saturday at the
White House, which will be open for three hours to the public, with
President and Mrs. Bush attending part of the time. They also
planned protests at the Celebration for Young Americans, said
coalition spokesman Mark Andersen.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday it will
allow the United States to replace diplomats expelled from Managua
in July and said it was ending the dispute as a gesture to the Bush
administration.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto called John Leonard, charge
d'affaires for the U.S. Embassy here, just as President Bush was
being inaugurated to tell him Nicaragua will begin immediately
issuing visas for U.S. diplomats.
   After a 90-minute meeting with Leonard, D'Escoto told reporters
that ``today's decision was a very generous measure'' by the
Sandinista government.
   ``It is a unilateral decision (designed) to normalize bilateral
relations with mutual respect,'' he said.
   The leftist government also waived a 15-day waiting period for
visas.
   Leonard told reporters the new administration ``is going to
consider'' the decision before commenting on it. ``We are going to
see what our (visa) needs are,'' he said.
   The gestures are believed to be the first conciliatory overture
by either country toward the other since former Secretary of State
George P. Shultz visited Managua 4{ years ago.
   Relations between Nicaragua and the United States were strained
throughout the Reagan administration because of U.S. support for the
anti-Sandinista rebels known as Contras.
   The Nicaraguan gesture comes during uncertainty about what policy
the Bush administration plans for Nicaragua. Secretary of
State-designate James Baker said during his confirmation hearings
last week that he will attempt to forge a bipartisan policy on that
issue but gave no details.
   Congress suspended aid to the Contras in February over strenuous
Reagan administration objections. The Bush administration has given
no indication it plans to seek to resume such aid.
   The U.S.-Nicaraguan conflict over accrediting diplomats dates
back to July 11, when Nicaragua ordered home U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. envoys on grounds they were interfering
in Nicaragua's internal affairs.
   The United States retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoys
from Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann.
   When the State Department submitted a list of envoys to
Sandinista authorities as replacements for the expelled diplomats,
Nicaragua refused to give them visas.
   The Sandinistas contended that the United States had acted beyond
its authority in expelling Tunnermann, who served both as ambassador
to the U.S. and to the Organization of American States.
   Sandinista officials contended that the State Department had no
right to expel an envoy accredited to an international organization.
   Subsequently, the Sandinistas refused to allow the remaining U.S.
diplomats in Nicaragua the right to return immediately when they
left the country either on official or personal business.
   Instead, the Sandinistas insisted on a waiting period of 15
working days.

<HEAD>Police Raise Possibility of Serial Killer In Six Stabbings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six women who frequented bars in the same
neighborhood have been slashed to death over the past 3{ years, and
detectives Friday said they believe a serial killer may be
responsible.
   ``We're not saying it is a serial killer, but if it's one person
we want to stop it before there is another victim,'' said police
spokesman Capt. Richard DeLise.
   None of the victims was alive when discovered. No motive has been
found and no links between victims other than the neighborhood have
been established.
   ``So far the clues are few, and the trail is slim,'' DeLise said.
   The latest victim was a 30-year-old woman found in the kitchen of
her tiny third-floor apartment on Thursday. She was nude except for
a pair of white socks. There were deep slash marks on her chest,
arms and head.
   Police said Theresa Sciortina had been sexually assaulted and
probably also beaten with a three-foot piece of wood. ``The fight
moved from one room to another (and) there was a large amount of
bleeding,'' said homicide Lt. James Henwood.
   The victims range in age from 28 to 68. Four visited the Golden
Bar in the city's Frankford section and police suspect they might
have met the killer there.
   The first victim, a 52-year-old woman, was found in 1985, stabbed
47 times and sexually assaulted. One victim, found under a truck in
1987, had been stabbed more than 74 times, severely beaten in the
face and sexually assaulted.
   ``You have multiple stabbings. You have women who have been known
to frequent the same bars in one neighborhood, and all the victims
were slashed numerous times,'' DeLise said.
   ``It is the same kind of M.O., and too much of a coincidence to
ignore. So that's where the investigation appears to be headed.''

<HEAD>Doctor Says Dali Condition Extremely Critical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FIGUERAS, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surrealist artist Salvador Dali was in
extremely critical but stable condition Friday from a heart ailment
aggravated by pneumonia, his physican reported.
   Dr. Carles Punsati read a statement to reporters at Figueras
Hospital at 8 p.m. saying the 84-year-old painter had suffered no
new complications and he no longer required the use of oxygen to
assist his breathing.
   ``His vital signs remain constant, and there have been no changes
in treatment,'' Punsati said.
   He said the prognosis remained extremely critical and that
barring any significant changes the next medical statement would be
issued Saturday morning.
   Dali's lawyer Robert Descharnes told the Spanish news agency EFE
he was pessimistic about the artist's condition and that Dali
appeared to be much worse than when he entered the Quiron Clinic in
Barcelona last November.
   ``In his regard you can see the strength and extraordinary will
to go on living and you can see a certain lucidity,'' Descharnes
said. ``But this does not contradict the grave crisis through which
he is passing.''
   Dali has been hospitalized three times since late November.
   He was taken from his Galatea Tower home in this northeastern
Spanish town to the intensive care unit of Figueras Hospital early
Wednesday after his condition deteriorated.
   He had been hospitalized for 16 days in the Quiron Clinic because
of his heart condition and blood clots in a lung and was released
Dec. 14. He was hospitalized again for three days in the Barcelona
clinic for an intestinal lesion and returned home Dec. 25.
   A founding member of the surrealist movement, Dali is the last of
a generation of Spanish painters that included Pablo Picasso and
Joan Miro.
   He was born May 11, 1904, in Figueras, 60 miles north of
Barcelona.
   Dali has suffered from chronic heart ailments and has been in
poor health and wheelchair-bound since August 1984, when he suffered
severe burns in a fire in his bedroom at Pubol Castle in La Pera.
   After the fire he was hospitalized for three months and then
moved to the Galatea Tower adjacent to his Theater-Museum in
Figueras.
   In 1986 he underwent surgery to receive a heart pacemaker.

   Congress paid tribute to the nation's 17th
Republican president on Friday but 46 of the 59 House and Senate
members lifting crystal champagne glasses to toast the newly
inaugurated George Bush were not GOP loyalists but opposition
Democrats.
   Both the House and Senate have Democratic majorities. But the
heavy tilt of the inaugural luncheon guest list suggested an effort
by the new president to reach out to the opposition, just as he said
he would do in his inaugural address minutes before.
   It is the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the first
American president and a large early oil portrait of George
Washington hung immediately behind Bush's chair at the main table in
historic Statuary Hall.
   An ensemble from the Smithsonian Institution, all of them playing
antique instruments, performed light 18th century airs, all of which
are known to have been played for Washington.
   Orchids, roses, poppies and other flowers spilled from vases set
on white fluted columns to the side and in the center of each table.
   Seated at tables of 10 each were members of Congress, Bush's
designated Cabinet nominees, and other officials and their spouses.
   The menu: lobster scallop ragout, grilled poussin, four grain
pilaf, asparagus, brandied pear crisp and vanilla ice cream,
reported to be Bush's favorite dessert.
   When lunch was done, the toasts were in order.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., chairman of the congressional inagural
arrangements committee, noted that in a room down the hall 25 of
Bush's grandchildren and the children of others in attendance were
dining with far less elegance _ but perhaps with as much
satisfaction.
   Their menu: grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken nuggets, fresh
fruit and milk.
   ``I have checked, Mr. President, and at their luncheon, there was
no talk of politics,'' Ford said.
   He then raised his glass of Korbel California champagne and
offered a toast: ``To your good health and long life with your lady
at your side.''
   Bush sprang to his feet in response, calling his inaugural ``the
people's day'' and noting that when the House sergeant-at-arms had,
a few moments earlier, addressed him as ``Mr. President,'' he had
not responded, thinking the remarks were addressed to former
President Reagan.
   He was soon restored to reality.
   ``I felt something between an affectionate hug and a kidney
punch,'' he said.
   Then he explained, using a familiar nickname for his
silver-haired wife, Barbara: ``It was the silver fox telling me to
get going.''
   ``No politics today,'' Bush said, turning serious. ``This is
going to be a very special day for the country. It's a wonderful way
to start this presidency.''
   He then toasted the House and the Senate.
   It was an occasion of gift-giving and Bush got four and Vice
President Dan Quayle got one.
   Two large mahogany boxes were carried in by waiters in black tie
and white gloves and opened to reveal two crystal bowls, hand carved
with an etching of the Capitol dome on one side, an arbor of cherry
trees on the other.
   Bush was presented the larger version, Quayle got the smaller.
   ``Just don't drop it please,'' Ford said as the presentation to
Bush was made.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois presented Bush
with a plaque on which was mounted one of the letter openers which
opened the envelopes containing the electoral vote giving Bush and
Quayle a total of 426 electoral votes and victory.
   Michel also presented Bush with an engraved portrait of Martin
Van Buren, the last sitting vice president until Bush to be elected
directly from the vice presidency to the presidency.
   Then it was the turn of House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas,
offering a memento of historic significance.
   Wright's plaque contained two charred bits of wood, one from the
Capitol, one from the White House, with an inscription identifying
them as parts of the fabric of those buildings burned by British
raiders on the evening of Aug. 24, 1814.
   And he presented it with a description of the commander of the
British forces, ``climbing with muddy boots in the speaker's
chair,'' and offering a mock resolution to his roistering soldiers:
``Resolved, that this harbor of Yankee democracy shall be burned.''
   The inscription on the plaque reads in part: ``Like these great
American institutions, men too can be hammered and forged and
ultimately strengthened in fire and adversity.
   ``In war and in peace in his tireless service both in the
legislative and executive branches of our government, President Bush
has been tested and tempered and shaped and made strong, in
experience and dedication, for the momentous duties he undertakes
today.''

   Fire damaged a vendor's truck and two hot dog
carts on the Ellipse near the inaugural parade route Friday, just as
President Bush and his party were preparing to leave the Capitol.
   The blaze, which began at 2:43 p.m., originated in a propane tank
attached to one of the carts, according to Lt. Ransom Washington of
the District of Columbia Fire Department.
   No one was injured and the site was not close enough to the route
to delay the procession.
   Many television viewers, however, watched the flames and thick
smoke as they waited for the presidential party to start down
Pennsylvania Avenue.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato on Friday recommended
criminal lawyer Otto Obermaier as Manhattan's federal prosecutor
Friday despite objections from the outgoing U.S. attorney, Rudolph
W. Giuliani.
   Giulian, whose crusades against the mob and insider-trading have
made him a possible contender for mayor, said a year ago he would
oppose Obermaier as his successor because several clients of
Obermaier's firm are targets of federal insider-trading
investigations. Giuliani put off his resignation because of the
problem.
   Giuliani had no comment Friday. He said last week he would not
speak publicly about the choice of his successor but would present
his views to the U.S. Justice Department, which will review
D'Amato's recommendation.
   The nomination is made by the president, with Senate
confirmation, but presidents generally accept the advice of senators
in their own party to fill such posts. D'Amato is a Republican.
   Obermaier, 52, a specialist in white-collar and securities law
for nearly 20 years, has said he would have no problem with the
conflict issue raised by Giuliani.
   ``I am delighted at being selected,'' he said in a statement. ``I
look forward to cooperating with the Justice Department to complete
the next step.''
   He did not return a telephone call.
   D'Amato, in a statement, called Obermaier ``one of the most
distinguished and respected practitioners in New York,'' with
``extensive experience in the federal courts in both civil and
criminal matters.''
   D'Amato did not return a telephone call, and his spokesman, Zenia
Mucha, would not comment directly on Giuliani's concern.
   D'Amato ``feels that Mr. Obermaier is qualified, is a good
candidate. He came with the highest recommendations. He's well
respected. He has a great reputation,'' Mucha said. ``And that's
about all the comment you're going to get from him on that.''
   Giuliani announced last week that he would depart by month's end.
He is considering running for mayor.
   Obermaier co-founded the New York law of Obermaier, Morvillo and
Abramowitz in 1970. His clients have included Robert Chestman, a
brokerage executive indicted last summer on insider trading and
perjury charges.
   Giuliani's office has been at the forefront of the Wall Street
scandal the past two years, prosecuting numerous cases of stock
manipulation and insider trading involving prominent companies and
businessmen.
   Obermaier was quoted in the National Law Journal in 1987 as
saying securities violations were being handled too often by
prosecutors as crimes rather than by the Securities and Exchange
Commission as civil matters.

<HEAD>Memoirs of World War II Hero Slam Stalin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pravda on Friday published previously secret
sections of the memoirs of World War II Marshal Georgy Zhukov that
blast Josef Stalin's war leadership and blame him for the
annihilation of thousands of Soviets.
   The memoirs in the Communist Party daily shattered the Soviet
image of Stalin as a war hero. The dictator depicted himself as the
saviour of the Soviet Union during the war, which killed at least 20
million Soviets.
   The image has endured despite Western studies that blame a large
part of the Soviet losses on Stalin's purge of the Red Army officer
corps in the late 1930s and on his refusal to believe that Nazi
leader Adolf Hitler could turn on him and order a German invasion.
   Zhukov was deputy commander-in-chief of the Soviet armed forces
during the war, second only to Stalin himself. Zhukov is considered
a hero of the defense of Moscow and Stalingrad.
   Pravda quoted Zhukov's daughter Maria as saying the marshal's
memoirs often have been cited by Stalinists as proof that Stalin was
a magnificent leader rather than the criminal portrayed in recent
Soviet publications.
   But Maria Zhukova said key sections of her father's writings were
left hidden in his safe for publication at some future, less
dangerous date.
   ``Many thousands of outstanding party workers, members of the
armed forces, faithful patriots of the motherland and talented
leaders of the country were annihilated by the order of Stalin,''
from 1937 to 1939, Zhukov wrote. ``Of course, one cannot forgive
Stalin.''
   The full page of excerpts in Pravda include Zhukov's report that
Stalin played no role in directing the war effort, although he often
called front-line commanders to issue orders devised by the general
staff as if they were his own.
   Pravda said Zhukov wrote an entire chapter on Stalin's
repressions of the army, but virtually all of it was deleted from
publication in his original memoirs.
   Pravda published only a few paragraphs on the subject itself,
instead concentrating on Zhukov's memories.
   The newspaper said Maria Zhukova was planning a book based on her
father's newly revealed memoirs.

   The coffin containing the remains of
U.S. Air Force pilot Fernando Ribas Dominicci, whose plane was shot
down during raids on Libya in April 1986, arrived in Puerto Rico
Friday.
   The remains will be buried Sunday in Ribas Dominicci's hometown

   The body arrived at San Juan's Munoz Marin International Airport
aboard an American Airlines flight and was received by family
members and government and military officials.
   Planes of the Puerto Rican Air National Guard flew a low level
formation over the ceremony as a National Guard band played the
Puerto Rican and U.S. anthems.
   Officials at the ceremony included Puerto Rican National Guard
Commander Alfredo Motra and Adm. John Moriarty, commander of the
U.S. Caribbean Naval Forces.
   Ribas Dominicci's body had been turned over by Libyan authorities
to Vatican officials in Rome last week and then was flown to a
military base in Dover, Del., en route to Puerto Rico.

<TEXT>
   China and Vietnam had five days of frank and
friendly talks on the prospects for peace in Cambodia and plan to
meet again soon, Vietnam said Friday.
   A Vietnamese spokesman said First Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh
Nho Liem of Vietnam returned to his country on Friday after the
secretive talks, the first high-level meeting between China and
Vietnam in more than nine years.
   Liem discussed Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia with Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing.
   They also discussed ``normalization of relations between the two
countries and other issues of concern,'' the spokesman said in a
statement.
   Relations between the two communist countries have been hostile
since Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to drive the pro-Chinese
Khmer Rouge from power.
   ``The exchange of views between the two sides was useful and took
place in a frank and friendly atmosphere,'' the spokesman said.
``The two sides reached a number of agreements. The remaining
questions will be discussed later.''
   The Vietnamese Embassy refused to elaborate on what agreements
were reached.
   The statement said Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
will be meeting soon with Qian. It did not give a specific date.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined comment on the meeting.
   The Vietnamese statement said the nations discussed ``the
international aspects'' of the conflict in Cambodia.
   ``The internal aspects of the problem will be settled among the
Cambodian parties themselves,'' the statement said.
   Vietnam has said it will withdraw all troops from Cambodia in
1990, but said on Jan. 7 it would pull its forces out by September
if a political solution could be reached.
   But China's relations with Vietnam have been cold since late
1978, when Vietnam toppled the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The
ultra-radical Khmer Rouge had ruled Cambodia since 1975 in a bloody
reign that left at least 1 million dead.
   Beijing attacked Vietnam in early 1979 to ``punish'' it for
invading Cambodia. Talks between the two countries ended in December
1979.
   Vietnam still insists on measures to prevent the Khmer Rouge from
returning to power. China has refused to exclude the Khmer Rouge
from a future Cambodian government but has said it is willing to
reduce its assistance to the Khmer Rouge and other guerrilla forces
as Vietnam pulls out.
   Vietnam says it has about 50,000 troops in Cambodia. Western
diplomats say the actual number is far larger.
   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia arrived in Bangkok
on Friday for weekend talks with Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan
of Thailand. Thai government spokesman Suvit Yodmani said the
``one-on-one'' talks may help ``quicken the pace of peace to
everyone's advantage.''
   Foreign ministers from nations belonging to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations also plan to discuss Cambodia this weekend
during a meeting in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.
   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abu Hasssan Omar said Friday he feels
that a solution to the Cambodian conflict can be found this year.
   He said ``it seems the time is right. The situation with regards
to the superpowers ... is warming up. Certainly there is a warming
up of relations between the superpowers.
   ``The attitude of Vietnam itself is favorable towards a peaceful
settlement and with all this we are very hopeful for a solution,''
he added.

   As George Bush headed across the Capitol on
Friday to bid farewell to Ronald Reagan, it took a sharp nudge from
his wife, Barbara, to remind him that from now on he's the one who
answers to ``Mr. President.''
   The new president recounted that moment at a luncheon with
leaders of Congress following the inaugural ceremony on the
red-carpeted terrace of the West Front of the Capitol. There he had
taken the same oath to defend the Constitution that George
Washington swore 200 years ago.
   Bush said that following his journey with Reagan up and down the
Capitol's labyrinth of steps, ``the sergeant of arms of the House
said, `Mr. President,' and I'm standing there waiting for President
Reagan. And I feel something that was between an affectionate hug
and a kidney punch _ the `Silver Fox' telling me to get going.''
   No one had to tell Bush to get going at the start of this day
when the nation's 43rd vice president became its 41st president.
   ``Guess who was up first?'' Barbara Bush, a.k.a. the ``Silver
Fox,'' asked reporters. ``He got up at 6 a.m.''
   That was no small feat in their temporary quarters at Blair
House, the government guest house across the street from the White
House, which was teeming with Bush children and grandchildren.
   The 64-year-old Bush, ever the early riser and a creature of
habit, apparently held fast to the schedule he scribbled beforehand
on a note pad for his press secretary:
   ``6 a.m. _ catch 3 news shows ...
   ``Drink coffee _
   ``Play with grand kids
   ``Pray
   ``Go to WHouse
   ``Go to Cap Hill
   ``Get sworn in.''
   The prayers came at St. John's Episcopal Church, ``the Church of
the Presidents'' across Lafayette Park from the White House.
   At the private service for the Bushes and Dan Quayle and his
wife, Marilyn, the Rev. John C. Harper said, ``We look to our
elected leaders to fulfill the law of love in their deeds.''
   As the Bushes departed, the organist played ``Onward Christian
Soldiers.'' Bush said afterwards he had prayed for ``strength _
strength (and) peace.''
   At midmorning, the Reagans played White House hosts for the final
time, inviting the Bushes and Quayles to the Blue Room for coffee
and pastries.
   Eight years earlier, Reagan and Bush wore formal morning suits
and ascots to Reagan's first inauguration. But on this day, Bush was
wearing a dark gray pinstripe business suit, and Reagan and Quayle
were in similar attire.
   Reagan, in a farewell visit to the Oval Office, had left behind a
handwritten note on the president's desk wishing Bush well.
   The president and the soon-to-be president rode together, up the
mile-long Pennsylvania Avenue route that Bush later traversed in the
opposite direction at the head of the inaugural parade _ part of it
on foot, like Jimmy Carter in 1977.
   The planners of these ceremonies had boasted beforehand that Bush
would start the oath of office at precisely 11:59.45 a.m. EST, so
that it would be exactly noon when he finished with the words ``so
help me God.''
   They were off by three minutes.
   On the platform on the Capitol's recently refurbished West Front,
the ceremony was to start at 11:30 a.m. It was 11:35 a.m. when
Barbara Bush was announced with a fanfare. She was resplendent in a
torquoise coat with no hat. The Reagans were announced at 11:38
a.m., Quayle at 11:42 a.m. and, finally, ``the vice president of the
United States,'' Bush himself, at 11:46 a.m.
   They all emerged through an archway draped in red bunting said to
be similar to that used on Federal Hall in New York City when
Washington was inaugurated in April 1789.
   It was only as he cleared the archway that he could see the
entire crowd, 200,000 strong, stretched across the Capitol's lawns,
onto parts of the Mall and packed densely along Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Most of the nearly 1,000 dignitaries, lawmakers and relatives
with platform tickets sat in ordinary gray folding chairs, but there
were four big, brown easy chairs for Bush, Quayle, Reagan and Sen.
Wendell Ford, D-Ky., the master of ceremonies.
   Billy Graham gave the invocation, and the sweet voices of the
Harlan Boys Choir intoned ``This is My Country.'' Bush and Quayle,
like Reagan, came out in topcoats, but Bush doffed his before he
spoke.
   It was cold and cloudy as Bush took the oath. Space heaters at
the foot of a bullet-proof glass screen provided some warmth around
the rostrum.
   Mrs. Dorothy Bush, the 87-year-old mother of the new president,
had a fur on, and someone lent her a second one to use as a blanket
for her knees. She was one of the last to leave the platform, helped
up the steps by a military officer and friend and later got a kiss
and a few words from her son.
   It was 11:58 a.m. when Quayle finished taking his oath, and at
high noon, Army Staff Sgt. Alvy R. Powell was belting out ``God
Bless America.''
   As he sang, one of Bush's granddaughters came bolting out of the
red archway and down the steps to the lap of her father, George. Her
grandmother turned, smiled and signaled for silence with a finger
across her lips.
   A few seconds before 12:03, Bush began repeating the oath after
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Mrs. Bush held two
Bibles _ a family Bible and the same Bible used at Washington's
inauguration, open to the Beatitudes of St. Matthew: ``Blessed are
the poor.''
   He and Barbara waved, and he prepared to speak, but Ford stopped
him to lean into the microphone and announce, ``Ladies and
gentlemen, the president of the United States!''
   Bush began with a tribute to Reagan, and then a prayer. And then
he spoke, for 20 minutes, from ``democracy's front porch,'' about
the ``new breeze'' blowing across this country and this world.
   The lawmakers behind him on the folding chairs listened
attentively. They applauded when Bush declared ``we have work to
do'' and talked of the poor and homeless.
   At 12:25 p.m. his speech was over. Powell came back to sing the
national anthem, and the ceremony ended.
   On the other side of the Capitol the Bushes and Reagans hugged,
shook hands and waved, then the Reagans boarded a Marine helicopter
for the start of the trip home to California.
   ``I was trying to keep the tears from running down my cheeks.
After eight years of friendship, it was pretty tough,'' Bush said
afterwards.
   Inside the Capitol, Bush went to the ornate President's Room to
sign a proclamation making Sunday a National Day of Prayer and
Thanksgiving and to send Congress the formal batch of nominations
for his Cabinet and other high-level jobs.
   The parade got off to a late start after lunch. The Bushes got
out of their limousine several times to wave to the crowd before he
was finally ensconced in the three-story reviewing stand outside
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   Bush planned to bring his grandchildren into the Oval Office on
Saturday. ``Basically ... it's dad showing off the new car,'' said
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   This day that began before dawn for Bush would not end until well
after midnight when he completed the rounds of all 11 inaugural
balls.
   But this night he would sleep in the White House _ and learn to
answer regularly to ``Mr. President.''

   An American scholar says he was was leafing
through sheets of music in a Hungarian archive when he realized he
was looking at the missing pieces of a never-performed concerto by
Franz Liszt.
   ``It was this kind of moment of discovery when you know you're
holding in your hand something significant to the music world. That
was a pretty exciting moment,'' musicologist Jay Rosenblatt recalled
Friday of his April discovery.
   He has assembled the scattered pieces and said the work will
premier in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's 1989-90 season.
   The newly restored concerto ``can be dated with some confidence
to 1839,'' when Liszt was in his late 20s, Rosenblatt said.
   ``It begins somewhat mysteriously, but ends in a kind of a
joyful, triumphant manner,'' he said. ``There is much in it that is
beautiful, and much in it that is imaginative.''
   Pieces of the concerto had been scattered in Nuremburg, West
Germany, and Weimar, East Germany, where Rosenblatt was winding up
six months of work on a dissertation.
   When he visited the Hungarian archive in Budapest last April, he
examined photocopies of manuscripts in Liszt's own hand. The copies
had been sent from Leningrad in the Soviet Union, where the
originals are kept.
   ``I leafed to the middle of the document to see what was there
and _ I recognized the music,'' said Rosenblatt, 33, a New York City
native and doctoral candidate at the University of Chicago.
   What he found was a concerto for piano and orchestra _ ``Concerto
Opus Posthumous'' is the working title. The concerto apparently was
reduced to fragments shortly after the composer's death in 1886.
   ``There were many manuscripts at his home in Weimar. ... And it
appears that his housekeeper offered them to students and friends.
As a result, Liszt manuscripts can be found all over the world,''
Rosenblatt said.
   Concert pianist Jerome Lowenthal told The New York Times the
concerto is ``a real work of Liszt, in that it has immediately the
thumbprint of that elegant, ironical genius.''
   The piece had been mentioned in 1982 by Liszt scholar Michael
Saffle, who found a manuscript at Weimar that apparently was a draft
of an unknown concerto. But the solo parts of the Weimar manuscript,
a copyist's version, were blank.
   Scholars in Budapest had not seen the Weimar document. But
Rosenblatt had, and made the connection immediately.
   The manuscript in Leningrad was Liszt's original handwritten
version, but it was missing a few pages. One page has since been
found in Nuremberg and two were discovered in Weimar. Combining all
four sources, every note is accounted for.
   The Hungarians are compiling a new edition of Liszt's complete
works, and the publisher, Edito Musica Budapest, agreed to let
Rosenblatt edit the concerto.
   ``We've got a situation here where even though the manuscript,
existed as a complete entity at one time, it no longer exists as
such,'' Rosenblatt said. ``Therefore the work only exists in my
edition. It's a kind of legal fiction,''
   ``It was the timing on many, many levels that made this all
possible,'' he said, noting the new era of openness between the
United States and Soviet bloc nations.

   Along with the trappings of power, George Bush
also inherited at Friday's inauguration the reality of power _
authority to order a nuclear attack.
   The satchel that contains the necessary codes to authorize such a
strike _ dubbed the ``football'' by government officials _ followed
President Reagan from the White House to the Capitol.
   When power was transferred from Reagan to Bush, the new president
got custody of the nuclear codes. A military aide carries the
satchel and is never very far away from the president.

   Thousands of cheering onlookers got waves and
smiles from President Bush and his wife Barbara along the inaugural
parade route, but only one got a kiss from Mrs. Bush _ TV weatherman
Willard Scott.
   As the Bushes walked to their reviewing stand in front of the
White House on Friday, Scott, who was on the air for NBC-TV, called
out, ``Mr. President, bless your heart, we love you.''
   Bush gestured that he had to keep moving, but Barbara Bush
hurried over and planted a loud smooch on Scott's face.
   ``How about that,'' Scott exclaimed. ``I've been kissed by the

   Dean Brundage and Marcia Little had an
unobstructed view of President Bush's inaugural parade: The sat atop
the horses they rode into the city.
   Brundage, a retired educator, said they trucked the horses from
his farm in suburban Fairfax County, Va., to Fort Myer across the
Potomac River from Washington and rode from there to the parade site.
   They were stopped occasionally by police who, Bruandage said,
could not cite any laws they were violating.
   Wearing riding boots and black felt-covered hard hats, they
easily saw over the heads of the other spectators.
   ``You have to be an NBA center to see over this crowd,'' Brundage

   Clothes may make the man. In the case of a
pre-inaugural bash, it required tuxedos.
   The formal wear apparently enabled a New York Daily News reporter
and a photographer to get past security at a gala $1,500-a-plate
inaugural celebration Wednesday night.
   Reporter Phil Roura and photographer John Roca said they didn't
have tickets or the proper press credentials to get by the guards
and metal detectors at the banquet in newly remodeled Union Station.
   They ended up shaking hands with President-elect Bush, Barbara
Bush, Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and Marilyn Quayle.
   In today's editions of the Daily News, Roura writes that he was
carrying a portable computer and Roca was lugging a bag of photo
equipment. But no one interfered with them as they made their way
past security guards and metal detectors and mingled with other
tux-clad guests.
   They didn't dine on the roast baby veal, Roura said, ``but
getting in was a piece of cake.''

   Morton Thiokol conducted the last of
six full-scale tests of its redesigned space shuttle booster Friday,
firing the rocket in conditions colder than those that contributed
to the Challenger disaster.
   The 126-foot booster, its 1.1 million pounds of solid propellent
chilled to a coldest-ever 40 degrees Fahrenheit, burned from a
horizontal position for 125 seconds at the company's Wasatch
Operations 25 miles west of here.
   The bright orange plume from the tail erased the snow from a
hillside during the test, which was delayed 90 minutes by a lack of
wind to blow away dust from the blast. Some 300 company and space
officials cheered as the rocket ignited.
   If post-test analysis turns up no serious problems, the test will
qualify the rocket for cold-weather launches, although further
testing on a smaller scale is planned, said Allan McDonald, vice
president of engineering for space operations.
   Identical boosters already have been used on two shuttle flights
in the four months since America's return to manned space flight.
   ``We feel very comfortable, if this test is successful _ and we
expect it will be _ that we will have really certified this solid
motor design for the next 20 to 30 years and wheagan and his wife Nancy
returned as private citizens to their beloved California on Friday,
having bid farewell to the White House after eight tumultuous years
at the pinnacle of American power.
   ``When you have to stay eight years away from California except
for an occasional visit, you live in a perpetual state of
homesickness,'' Reagan said at an airport ceremony where he was
greeted by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, comedian Rich Little and
actor Robert Stack.
   ``It has been a bittersweet several hours this day,'' Reagan told
a crowd estimated at 700 gathered at Los Angeles International
Airport to welcome his arrival. ``There aren't enough words to say
what is really in our hearts.''
   Little kidded the former president about having to find a job,
and Reagan _ the former actor _ quipped that he had a movie deal in
the works.
   ``I was asked to play a part in a remake of `Bedtime For Bonzo,'
only this time they wanted me to play Bonzo,'' Reagan said. ``He
wasn't a very freindly type.''
   During his Hollywood days Reagan played opposite a mean-tempered
chimpanzee in a series of ``Bonzo'' movies.
   As the Air Force jet made its way across the country, the Reagans
served cake and champagne as they hosted a small group of reporters
for an off-the-record session in what had been the presidential
cabin in the forward section of the aircraft.
   As president, it was extremely rare for Reagan to mingle with
reporters flying with him on Air Force One, and it was virtually
unheard of for any of them to be invited up to his cabin.
   The Reagans left Andrews Air Force Base, Md., at 1:10 p.m. EST
and flew home, both vowing to pursue objectives they battled for
during the president's two terms.
   The former first couple waved to a cheering crowd of about 2,000
at Andrews, and Reagan received a 21-gun salute as he reviewed a
platoon from each of the five branches of the military service.
Reagan did not address the crowd.
   With their dog, Rex, the Reagans boarded the plane that in the
previous eight years would have been designated Air Force One. A
sign in the crowd read ``So Long Gipper.''
   About an hour earlier Reagan stood by as George Bush took the
presidential oath of office at the Capitol. Bush, who fought Reagan
tirelessly for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 before
becoming his vice president, turned to Reagan after taking the
presidential oath and said, ``President Reagan, on behalf of the
American people I thank you for the wonderful things you have done
for America.''
   Reagan, asked while he was walking with Bush through the Rotunda
of the Capitol if he felt a sense of relief, said, ``No, but a great
pride in what's happening.''
   Following the solemn swearing-in ceremonies and Bush's acceptance
speech, Bush and his wife, Barbara, escorted the Reagans to the east
side of the Capitol to a waiting helicopter, where they said their
goodbyes with handshakes and kisses.
   As the Reagans stood in the doorway of the Marine helicopter,
Reagan turned and snapped a salute to Bush, who returned it.
   Asked by a reporter for his final thoughts, Reagan said only,
``Carry on.''
   The Bushes were joined by Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, who waved goodbye to the Reagans before their helicopter
lifted off and made a final sweep of the Mall and White House.
   Old foes at home and abroad praised Reagan, the first president
to serve eight years since Dwight D. Eisenhower gave up the office
to John F. Kennedy in 1961.
   He is, ``according to all external indications, leaving office as
a completely successful political figure,'' said Pravda, the
official voice of the Soviet Union, the nation that Reagan denounced
in 1983 as an ``evil empire.''
   Reagan began his final day in office with a nostalgic visit to
the Oval Office to make sure, according to his spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, that the presidential office was shipshape for his
successor.
   His national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, who so
often briefed Reagan there on trouble spots throughout the globe,
told him, ``The world is quiet today, Mr. President.''
   Powell's words were relayed to reporters by Fitzwater, who was
present during the Oval Office visit.
   Then, for the last time, Reagan made the walk through an arched
colonnade to the executive mansion, where he and Mrs. Reagan lived
and where the Bushes will now live.
   In a soft voice, he called out ``goodbye'' to members of the
White House staff and journalists seeing him off.
   Fitzwater said the last piece of paper the president signed was a
letter to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, thanking her for
her support. In London, Thatcher saluted the outgoing president as
``a true and perfect gentleman.''
   The first lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said that after
returning to the executive mansion the president joined his wife in
walking hand in hand down the central hallway and spending a few
minutes in the Yellow Oval room overlooking the Washington Monument
and Jefferson Memorial.
   The Reagans also said their goodbyes to the domestic staff.
   Then, as their final social duty, they offered coffee and
pastries in the Blue Room to Bush; his wife, Barbara; Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle; his wife, Marilyn; and members of the
congressional delegation sent to escort them all to the Capitol for
the inauguration.
   At the Capitol, Reagan wore a black overcoat and white scarf in
chilly, overcast weather, and Mrs. Reagan wore her familiar red coat
as ``Hail to the Chief'' was played for the last time of the Reagan
presidency.
   Reagan flew on an Air Force plane designated SAM 27000. It was
the same plane he had flown thousands of miles on as Air Force One
when he was president. But Air Force One is a radio code reserved
for the plane on which the president flies and is not used when a
sitting president is not on the plane.
   From the Los Angeles airport, the Reagans were going by motorcade
to the home in the fashionable Bel-Air neighborhood that they are
renting from friends who bought it for $2.5 million. The pool of
reporters assigned to fly with him from Washington, however, were
not included in the motorcade as they are on presidential trips. As
a private citizen, Reagan gets to travel without them.
   Reagan has said he plans to speak out on behalf of causes he has
long favored, such as the line item veto for presidents and repeal
of the constitutional amendment limiting them to two terms.
   Mrs. Reagan has lent her support to a drug abuse treatment center
planned in a bankrupt hospital at Lake View Terrace, 15 miles north
of Bel-Air on the edge of the Angeles National Forest.

   World leaders attended a lavish banquet
Friday to pay tribute to former Chancellor Willy Brandt, who guided
postwar West Germany toward reconciliation with the Soviet bloc.
   ``Your unwavering commitment to peace, your courage and your
humanity have made you one of the world's leading post-war
figures,'' West German President Richard von Weizsaecker said in a
speech honoring the elder statesman and 1971 Nobel Peace Prize
laureate.
   ``Because of you, we have reason to be proud to be German,''
Weizsaecker said.
   After the speech, Brandt quipped: ``Unless I do something really
stupid in future _ which one can never rule out _ you have given me
a fine eulogy today.''
   Later, in a short speech, Brandt turned to several former
political opponents in the government and said, ``We have fought a
lot since 1949, but we have also achieved a great deal, brought much
into being.''
   The guest list for birthday banquet at Weizsaecker's villa in
Bonn included leaders from Europe and other continents. Venezuela's
President Carlos Andres Perez attended with Polish Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Israeli Finance Minister Shimon Peres, French
President Francois Mitterrand and leaders from Austria, Norway,
Sweden and Portugal.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
and scores of other West German leaders also attended.
   Rakowski praised Brandt, 75, as the architect of Polish-West
German reconciliation after World War II.
   Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, and Poland's population
suffered horribly under the occupation.
   Although he resigned as chancellor as a result of a humiliating
spy scandal in 1974, Brandt has retained enormous prestige and
remains a leading figure in domestic politics and international
affairs.
   Brandt, a Social Democrat, is president of the Socialist
International, an alliance of democratic Socialist parties.
   During his chancellorship, he helped bridge the postwar gap
between West Germany and the Soviet bloc through a series of
normalization agreements with Communist countries that became
collectively known as ``Ostpolitik.''
   Brandt, who was forced to flee Nazi Germany in 1933 because of
his political views, is also credited with improving ties with
Israel.

   Racing the afternoon sun
westward, Ronald Reagan said Friday that he and his wife, Nancy,
were eager to ``return to a life we did love very much.''
   Hours after watching George Bush take the oath of office as his
successor, the former president and the ex-first lady talked with
reporters for about 20 minutes midway through the 5{-hour flight
from Washington to Los Angeles.
   ``It was hard to say goodbye,'' Reagan said, adding that leaving
the White House had been ``a time of tears for a great many people
and certainly for us.''
   On his last morning in the White House, he said, he had paid a
final visit to the Oval Office to see that things he asked be
shipped to his new home in suburban Bel-Air had been taken care of.
``It did look pretty bare,'' he commented.
   But the future was more on his mind.
   Returning to California, Reagan told reporters, will mean ``a
return to a life we did love very much. California isn't a place in
my mind; it's a way of life, so that's the sweet part of the
bittersweet experience.''
   There were 1,000 invited guests on hand for a rally after a
midafternoon landing at Los Angeles International Airport. Then
there was a motorcade to the $2.5 million home bought for them by
friends.
   Would there be a rest break, he was asked?
   ``Listen, we're just moving into a new house,'' he said. ``We
didn't get the job done over the holidays, when we were there.''
   When a reporter returned to his visit to Oval Office and asked
about his feelings, Reagan replied, ``There's a nostalgia with all
of this and it was kind of just that, a nostalgic moment of wanting
to take one more look at the place that every morning I've been
walking into, leaving in the evening, and it was just sheer
nostalgia.''
   At this point, Mrs. Reagan interjected, without being asked,
``And he never took naps. ... In eight years, he never took a nap.''
   In fact, the president added, ``She sometimes gets edgy because
she thinks I should be able to take a nap.''
   Reagan said he had left a note for Bush in the Oval Office _
``just a little one telling him just to carry on and he'd be in my
thoughts and prayers.'' Asked if he had any plans to return to
movies, Reagan said, ``No, there is a kind of a lingering feeling
that would look a little bit like trying to cash in on this job that
I've had.''
   When a reporter pointed out that acting had been his profession
before politics, Reagan began, ``Well. ...'' Before he could go
further, Mrs. Reagan interjected, ``You don't go back.''
   The former first lady, asked about her eight years in Washington,
said, ``The first year was terrible. ... I got off on the wrong
foot.''
   Later, she said, people were very kind and ``it got to the point
where I'd say, `Don't say anything nice about me, please,' because
I'll start to cry.''
   Reagan said there were ``things that I wanted,'' including ``a
change in the abortion situation,'' but that ``you just run out of
time. And that's why I believe I can continue working for those
things by taking the case to the people.''
   Reporters asked what inheritance he left for Bush.
   Mrs. Reagan answered, ``A peaceful world.'' Reagan added, ``I
think there is a better relationship worldwide than we've had and
certainly the economic situation is something different than it was
when we came here.''

   The names of hospitals with serious problems
maintaining safety or quality could be revealed to inquiring members
of the public under a proposal being weighed by a group that sets
industry standards, a spokesman said Friday.
   At present, when accredited hospitals slip in safety or quality
they are listed as having ``tentative non-accreditation,'' but that
status is concealed from the public, said David Bushelle of the
government-authorized Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations.
   Accreditation, a seal of approval, qualifies a hospital to
receive Medicare and Medicaid benefits, which together may total up
to half a hospital's income.
   About 420 of the nation's 7,000 hospitals fall into the
``tentative non-accreditation'' category, Bushelle said. The
designation allows hospitals up to a year ``to clean up their act''
before their next inspection and possible loss of accreditation, he
said.
   ``We found this system is too lengthy and inefficient and it
undermines the credibility of the accreditation process,'' he said.
``Also, hospitals performing satisfactorily and above-average
hospitals under the old system are all grouped together with
hospitals that are performing marginally, because the joint
commission identifies all these hospitals as being accredited.''
   Rule changes being considered by the Chicago-based commission
would force hospitals to correct problems faster, Bushelle said.
They also would allow disclosure of a hospital's status to anyone
who asked, he said.
   ``Under the new system, a hospital will be either accredited,
conditionally accredited or non-accredited,'' Bushelle said, with
``conditionally accredited'' replacing ``tentatively
non-accredited.''
   The head of a 12,000-member medical consumers group labeled the
proposed changes ``a teeny, teeny step. That's all.''
   Arthur Levin, director of the New York-based Center for Medical
Consumers, said in a telephone interview Friday that providing
information on request is not the same as making inspection results
public.
   ``Most people will not be aware of, and perhaps not capable of,
figuring out `Who do I call, and how do I get the information?'''
Levin said. ``If you know enough to make your way to the joint
commission, they'll answer your question, but it's not a great leap
forward.''
   Thomas Morford, director of health standards and quality for the
federal Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees
accreditation and certification of hospitals, said the changes
``would be a rational place to begin.''
   Questions about whether the joint commission is making adequate
inspections have intensified since the Wall Street Journal in
November 1988 revealed shoddy conditions in accredited hospitals,
Morford said.
   Morford said his agency has recently increased the number of its
``validation'' inspections, or government inspections to compare
with joint commission findings.
   The proposed rule changes also call for routinely giving
Morford's agency full information on inspections at hospitals that
slip to a ``conditionally accredited'' rating. Such information now
is provided only at the agency's request.
   The agency cannot disclose such inspection information to the
public under current law but a move is afoot on Capitol Hill to have
the law changed, Bushelle said.
   ``People have a right to know,'' said Bill Vaughan, an aide to
Rep. Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., who is looking into the matter.
   ``The Medicare budget is $109 billion,'' he said in a telephone
interview Friday from Washington. ``(Payments to) hospitals are 65
percent of that.''
   The board of the joint commission is to consider changing
accreditation rules Feb. 12 to consider changing disclosure rules
April 29, Bushelle said.
   The board is made up of representatives of the American College
of Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, the American Dental
Association, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical
Association and the public.

   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the Supreme Court sported
headgear Friday that added a touch of history to President Bush's
inauguration.
   Rehnquist and O'Connor wore black skullcaps that are part of a
British tradition for judges dating back to the early 16th Century,
according to historians.
   The skullcaps, seldom worn in this era, have been part of the
justices' official dress in the past.
   A photograph on display in the Supreme Court building shows Chief
Justice Charles Evan Hughes wearing one at the inauguration of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941.
   Rehnquist administered the oath of office to Bush, and O'Connor
swore in Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Rehnquist and O'Connor removed the skullcaps before administering
the respective oaths.
   Supreme Court officials said a supply of the skullcaps is kept on
hand for just such occasions.

   The real transition on this inaugural day took
place in the White House between 11:05 a.m. and noon. Seventy
pictures of Ronald and Nancy Reagan bit the dust. Seventy pictures
of George and Barbara Bush and their bushel of kin took their place.
   The cue for this hurried redecorating was the departure of the
motorcade carrying the Reagans and Bushes to the Capitol for the
swearing-in ceremony.
   ``We made sure he had left the complex first,'' said Frank Posey,
the White House frame maker. ``We have a lot of respect for him.''
   Everywhere in the White House were signs of the new replacing the
old. From the press office came the Bush administration's first
official announcement, advising the news media what Mrs. Bush was
going to wear for the inaugural balls.
   That gown, if tradition holds, will end in the First Ladies
exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution. But the new First Lady's
press office decreed that its description be held secret until 8
p.m., the first instance of news management in the fledgling
administration.
   As Bush recited the oath of office, Interior Department workmen
in green uniforms were carrying what appeared to be office furniture
out the front door of the White House and placing it in an unmarked
van.
   No one would say where in the White House it was used. The
Reagans' personal furniture was shipped to their Los Angeles home in
October.
   In the Cabinet Room, a painting of the Declaration of
Independence replaced Calvin Coolidge over the mantelpiece. The
chairs of four holdover cabinet secretaries, marked with metal
plaques, are joined by new ones that are unmarked until their owners
are confirmed.
   New in the Oval Office are six plates from the Chinese dinner
service that is part of the White House collection, a desk set _
blotter, letter holder of leather and gold _ and 20 family pictures.
Also a bust of Theodore Roosevelt and a foot-high sculpture of a
horse, Bush's prize for being the 1981 Houstonian of the Year,
selected by the Houston School for the Deaf.
   Bush requested only the picture of the Declration of
Independence. Of everything else, said Fitzwater, ``he may change it
all tomorrow.''
   The new president won't see any of this until Saturday when he
visits his new office for the first time. Bush will find a familiar
chair behind the desk _ wheeled down the hall from the Vice
President's office.
   A lonely group of press office holdovers watched the inaugural
ceremonies on television monitors. But soon the place began fillng
up with Bush staffers arriving to take on their new jobs, occupying
offices that until Friday had belonged to the Reagan team.
   ``Just one president going out, one going in,'' said B. Jay
Cooper, who will stay on under press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
another holdover.
   The press office itself remained neutral. On its walls are
pictures of former presidents _ back to Franklin Roosevelt _ meeting
with reporters.
   They didn't change, but other photographs did.
   Down came pictures of Nancy Reagan in red skirt and pink blouse,
and of Reagan standing in front of his desk. Up went portraits of
George and Barbara Bush.
   Like a whirlwind, Posey and his crew swept through the West Wing
replacing the 19-inch-by-23-inch pictures.
   One photograph, taken at the Bush vacation home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, appeared to have all the Bushes' five children, their
spouses, and 10 grandchildren. Another showed him fly casting in a
spraying surf and another had him posing with former presidents Ford
and Carter.
   One picture, however, wasn't changed. The photograph, looming
over a stairway, features Bush and Reagan.
   The new occupant of one press office cubicle is Alixe Glen, who
has worked for Bush since he made his first run at the presidency in
1979 _ first as a volunteer, then inhis campaign and in the vice
president's office. She left for a while, then came back when Bush
officially declared his intention to run again for president in 1987.
   ``It's so very exciting,'' she said. ``I've waited eight years
for this. For eight years I've known what a great president he would
be and now the whole country will know.''
   In the Bush administration she will hold the title of deputy
press secretary, one of four. And she'll have to get used to calling
Bush by a new title.
   ``It's going to be an adjustment,'' she said. ``We have been
saying V.P. for so long.''

<TEXT>
   A commander of rebels operating around
the Afghan capital of Kabul predicts Afghanistan's Marxist
government will collapse within weeks after the Soviet troop
withdrawal set to be completed next month.
   Abdul Haq, field leader of the main faction of guerrillas
positioned around Kabul, said Afghan soldiers ``don't want to die
for the regime and the party people are on their way out of
Afghanistan.''
   He spoke in a recent interview in Peshawar, where a seven-party
alliance of Afghan guerillas is headquartered.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan say about 10,000 members of
Afthanistan's ruling People's Democratic Party have fled the country
since the Soviets began their withdrawal last May.
   By Western estimates the party has about 55,000 members, but
President Najib and other party leaders have placed the membership
at about 200,000.
   The Soviets sent more than 100,000 soldiers into Afghanistan
beginning in December 1979 to help the government battle the
anti-communist rebels. Under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed last
April the Soviet Union is to remove all of its military forces by
Feb. 15.
   Haq, 30, said the Afghan Marxists ``could be taken care of in
five or 15 days,'' after the Soviet pullout.
   He said most of the government troopers are undisciplined young
men pressed into military service, but he acknowledged that units
such as the elite Palace Guard and the state security force are
still in fighting shape.
   ``They will be the last people to leave after the Soviets,'' Haq
said.
   He claimed the rebels have infiltrated the army, the Palace Guard
and new communist commando units. He said some ranking military
officers have pledged their allegiance to the rebels but remained in
the Marxist fold to dismantle it from within once the Soviets leave.
   Byt Haq said he fears there will be chaos in Kabul if rebel
leaders are not ready with a political alternative to Najib's
government.
   The guerrillas have announced plans to convene a shura, or
council, consisting of 60 nominees from each of the seven rebel
parties to select a transitional government.
   Moscow has said a broad-based council is a move in the right
direction but that the organization should include representatives
of the People's Democratic Party.
   Haq said such a combination of anti-communist Moslems and
Marxists would be ``a formula for continued fighting and not peace.''
   In Iran, a spokesman for Afghan rebels based there complained
that they had not been consulted about political moves being
prepared by their colleagues in Pakistan.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, in a report monitored in
Cyprus, quoted Mohammad Karim Khalili of the Iran-based Afghan
rebels as saying on state-run television: ``The decision to create
such a shura has been made without coordination with the coalition
and independent Afghan groups.''
   The Afghan resistance is divided into two major groups _ the
Iran-based Shiite Moslem alliance and the larger Sunni Moslem
coalition headquartered n Pakistan.
   The Shiite alliance, fearing it would lack strength in the shura,
wants a Cabinet to be formed before agreeing on the council.

<TEXT>
   A member of a Chicago street gang
testified Friday in the murder and conspiracy trial of Noah
Robinson, half-brother of Jesse Jackson, that the defendant asked
the gang to kill a man.
   Eugene Hunter, who served time in an Illinois prison for murder,
testified for the prosecution that he participated in planning the
murder of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber but did not pull the trigger.
   Hunter, formerly a high-ranking member of the El Rukn gang of
Chicago, also has been charged with murder in the 1986 slaying here.
   Hunter described the complicated structure of the gang and said
it made millions of dollars in selling narcotics, murder-for-hire,
and extortion.
   Hunter testified he and another member of the gang met with
Robinson about a week after Christmas in 1985.
   ``He had said he had been home and had a fight with Hambone, and
he had kicked his behind,'' he testified. ``He said he was tired of
the situation and wanted us to take care of it.''
   Robinson, a Greenville native, is accused of hiring the El Rukn
gang to come to Greenville and kill Barber in January 1986. Robinson
also is accused of conspiring to kill a witness to Barber's death, a
woman who survived a stabbing attack.
   Robinson has maintained that he is a victim of a political
conspiracy caused partly by the success of his half-brother.
Robinson and Jackson share the same father, but the former
Democratic presidential candidate has said he has had no recent
contact with his half-brother.
   Earlier Friday, Caroline Harris testified she had lived in a
building owned by Robinson and had worked for him in Chicago. She
said Robinson had been having problems with Barber, also a former
employee.
   Warrants have been issued for the five members of the El Rukn
gang who are accused of taking part in the slaying.

   A pharmaceutical company was fined $115,000 and
a former executive sentenced to six months in a work-release program
Friday for marketing an unapproved drug linked to the deaths of 38
premature babies.
   James B. Madison, 68, vice president of operations for
now-defunct O'Neal, Jones &amp; Feldman Pharmaceuticals, had pleaded
guilty to wire fraud and mislabeling.
   The company, now called O'Neal Inc., was sole distributor of
E-Ferol Aqueous Solution, used for treatment of retrolental
fibroplasia, a disease that can cause blindness in premature infants
exposed to too much oxygen.
   The product, which was never tested by the Food and Drug
Administration, was introduced in 1983 and recalled in 1984 after
reports of infant deaths associated with its use.
   U.S. District Judge Clyde Cahill sentenced Madison to a jail
work-release program, placed him on three years' probation and
ordered him to contribute $10,000 to a charity that helps children.
   O'Neal, which pleaded gilty to charges including mail fraud and
failure to get approval of a new drug application, was ordered to
pay $125,000 in court costs in addition to the fine.
   On Thursday, the now-defunct manufacturer of the drug,
Carter-Glogau Laboratories Inc. of Glendale, Ariz., was fined
$130,000. Its former president, Ronald M. Carter, and O'Neal's
former president, Larry K. Hiland, were sentenced to six months in
jail and ordered to contribute $65,000 each toward drug-safety
research.
   Carter-Glogau, Carter and Hiland were convicted of conspiracy,
marketing an unapproved drug and misbranding the drug.
   The two companies and their insurers reached settlements totaling
millions of dollars with the families of children treated with the
drug.

   Iran-Contra defendant Oliver L. North, urging
conservative students to stay involved in politics, called George
Bush's inauguration as president Friday the celebration of a ``great
victory.''
   The former White House aide refused to comment on Ronald Reagan's
decision not to pardon North and fellow defendant John M. Poindexter
before leaving office.
   Asked if he would comment on the pardon situation, North said
bluntly ``No'' before driving away from a hotel in nearby Rosslyn,
Va., where he appeared at a support rally staged by a conservative
group, Students for America.
   In an interview Thursday, Reagan said he still believes North and
Poindexter will be found innocent of criminal wrongdoing in
connection with the Iran-Contra affair, which involved diversion to
the Nicaraguan rebels of profits from secret arms sales to Iran.
   Reagan also said that granting pardons for either man would have
left them ``forever after with that guilt hanging over them.''
   North was greeted by cheers and chanting of ``Ollie! Ollie!''
when he appeared before the student audience, which displayed a
banner declaring ``Oliver North, American Hero.''
   ``My exhortation to you, my encouragement to you is to stay
involved in the political process that we've commemorated in this
city today,'' he told the convention.
   He called the inauguration ``the celebration of this great
victory, the celebration of this peaceful transition from one
executive to another.''
   ``The mandate is clear,'' North said. ``In the election of George
Bush to the presidency of the United States, the American people
said, `we believe in the free enterprise system, we believe in the
support for freedom around the world.' And it's now important that
you communicate that very sense to the elected members of Congress,
who have in many cases opposed those ideas.''
   The former National Security Council aide is scheduled to stand
trial here Jan. 31 on 12 felony charges, including allegations he
lied to various inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair and illegally
used a tax-exempt foundation to help raise money for the Nicaraguan
rebels.

<HEAD>Icebreaker Rescues Researchers On Polar Station</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet icebreaker broke through a wall of ice and
rescued researchers trapped on an ice floe drifting off Greenland,
Tass reported Friday.
   The icebreaker Rossiya failed on its first attempt to reach the
North Pole 28 station from the south on Thursday, but swung around
and ``smashed a channel to the men in distress from the north,'' the
official Soviet news agency said.
   ``The ship's crew and the scientists are now evacuating the
equipment of the polar station,'' it said. Tass did not say how many
scientists were at the station.
   Capt. Anatoly Lamekhov of the Rossiya reported rapidly rising
winds and heavy snow had cut visibility to near zero.
   The worsening weather also foiled scientists' plans to trap the
research ship Otto Schmidt in the ice floe and have it complete the
research mission of North Pole 28, Tass said.
   The ship was taken farther south to safer waters away from the
rapidly shifting ice floe to await an escort from the icebreaker,
Tass said.
   The decision to evacuate North Pole 28 was made after the ice
floe on which it was placed was caught in a warm current north of
Greenland and began drifting southward and melting.
   It could no longer hold a rescue plane, so the Rossiya was
dispatched Sunday from the Arctic port of Murmansk.
   Soviet media did not exactly what kind of research the scientists
were conducting.
   North Pole 28 was set up in May 1986 north of the New Siberian
Islands, which lie in the Sea of Laptev north of the coast of
central Siberia.
   Slowly carried by the ice floe, it drifted near the North Pole,
and lay only 17 miles from the pole in the spring of 1988, Tass
said. The station was then picked up by the East Greenland current,
which rapidly brought it into the relatively warm waters of the
North Atlantic, Tass said.

   Snow was scattered around the Great Lakes into New England on
Friday, and rain fell across parts of the South.
   The heaviest snow was reported over northwestern Wisconsin, where
6 inches was reported between midnight and dawn on the Lake Superior
shore in Iron County, and 12 inches had been reported over that snow
belt since Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service said.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2 inches of snow fell at
Marquette, Mich.
   Snow showers and squalls continued into early afternoon from
northern and central New England across the lower Great Lakes, Ohio,
northern and eastern Indiana, Michigan and northern Wisconsin.
   Rain fell from the coast of the Carolinas across central Georgia,
from southern Alabama and northwestern Florida across the Texas Gulf
Coast into central Texas.
   Dense fog shrouded the western half of Utah, stalling commercial
airline flights at Salt Lake International Airport and reducing
traffic on interstate freeways to a crawl.
   Airport Operations Manager Frank Ratliff said commercial aircraft
took off and landed with no apparent problem until about 10 a.m.,
when a 45-minute ``gate hold'' was ordered. Meteorologist William J.
Alder said visibility was down to about one-eighth of a mile at
10:20 a.m.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees above zero at Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to 83 at Key West,
Fla. Friday morning's low was 26 degrees below zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Saturday, snowshowers were forecast from northern New England
through the lower Great Lakes. Snow also was forecast over the
mountains of northwestern Montana, changing to rain at lower
elevations and reaching across the northern Pacific Coast. Scattered
showers were forecast over southern Florida.
   Highs near 10 degrees were predicted from northern Maine across
northeastern New York state; in the teens and 20s over the remainder
of New England through the lower Great Lakes, Michigan, northern
Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota; in the 50s and 60s over
southern Georgia, northern Florida and the lower Mississippi Valley,
and from southwestern South Dakota across the central and southern
Plains; in the 60s and low 70s over central through southern Florida
and from southern Arizona across the southern third of California;
and generally in the 30s and 40s over the remainder of the nation.

   Sandinistas celebrated the end of the
Reagan era with dancing in the streets, meetings at factories and
parades that mocked him and the local opposition.
   People dressed up as former President Reagan, Uncle Sam and
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, a strong critic of the leftist
Sandinista government. One float showed Uncle Sam throwing dollars
and the opposition picking them up.
   A huge plaza was cordoned off for dancing.
   Panamanians, led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, also celebrated
Reagan's departure, shooting fireworks at noon and dancing to bands
in a plaza on Panama City's main thoroughfare.
   In Managua, a headline in the pro-government Nicaraguan daily El
Nuevo Diario read, ``Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Reagan's Gone.''
   ``There is pride, satisfaction on our part, but not celebration
of victory because the war has not ended and even if it ends, the
effects cannot disappear at cannot end from night to day,'' Bayardo
Arce, vice coordinator of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation
Front's political commission, said in an interview with the Front's
daily Barricada.
   He noted that rebels, known as Contras and armed by the United
States, remain in Honduras and ``are capable of continuing to carry
out military operations.''
   Fighting in the 7-year-old war has declined since the Sandinistas
and the rebels signed a tentative cease-fire agreement last March
23, a month after the United States stopped military aid to the
Contras.
   However, talks on a permanent agreement have been stalled since
September. Although most of the rebels are back in camps in
Honduras, clashes continue, particularly in southwestern Nicaragua.
   The government has said it hopes relations will improve under
President Bush.
   As soon as Bush was sworn in, the government said it would
immediately begin issuing visas for U.S. diplomats.
   Nicaragua imposed visa restrictions after each country expelled
eight of the other's diplomats, including the ambassadors, last July.
   Arce said U.S. analysts indicate that Bush ``could present
possibilities of political change.''
   But he said, ``You have to be prudent, which doesn't mean letting
down your guard, and continue working for peace and be prepared to
the maximum for any eventuality.''
   El Nuevo Diario said the celebrations were organized by the
Front's Department of Agitation and Propaganda.
   Unlike the Nicaraguans, Noriega, chief of Panama's Defense Forces
and the country's de facto leader, said he expects nothing of Bush.
   He said he was celebrating Reagan's departure ``like any other
Panamanian.'' Nearby, supporters burned effigies of Reagan, former
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle and members of the
Panamanian opposition.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma and other officials also
attended the celebration.
   The Reagan administration still recognizes Delvalle as president,
although he was ousted after trying to fire the general last
February.
   The United States has been trying to pressure Noriega to resign
since he was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug charges in February.
Noriega denies the charges and is mentioned as a possible
presidential candidate in May 7 elections.
   The pro-government newspaper Critica published a photo of Reagan
on the front page with the caption, ``At last the genocidal Ronald
Reagan leaves.''

   President Reagan's departure from the
government doesn't mean he will be without government benefits _
ranging from a lucrative pension to around-the-clock Secret Service
protection and an office suite in which to work.
   Reagan, in fact, will receive two pensions, one from his eight
years as president and another from his eight years as governor of
California. Both the former president and Mrs. Reagan also have
plans to write books and make speeches, for which they are expected
to command handsome fees.
   Reagan's California state pension is $29,188 a year. His federal
pension currently is $99,500, but would jump to $155,000 if Congress
approves a salary increased Reagan has recommended.
   In addition, the Secret Service will provide lifetime
around-the-clock protection and he will have at his disposal a
penthouse office suite in California and a townhouse in Washington.
   The security applies to both Mr. Reagan and Mrs. Reagan, but not
to their children because they are adults. However, the protection
does apply not only to the Reagan's new home in a fashionable Los
Angeles suburb, but also to their 688-acre ranch north of Santa
Barbara.
   In addition, the government will pay to ship Reagan's papers to
California and process them at an estimated cost of up to $500,000.
Another $1.3 million has been set aside for providing storage for
the papers.
   Each former president receives a office allowance of up to
$300,000. Reagan already has waiting for him a penthouse office
suite in a Los Angeles office building. The suite includes offices
for Reagan, Mrs. Reagan, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation,
the Secret Service, and an aide.
   The Reagans' personal wealth is difficult to measure from public
documents. Reagan's latest financial disclosure statement, which
discloses assets in only broad categories, said only that their
assets, which are in a blind trust, were valued at more than
$250,000.
   The Reagans bought their ranch near Santa Barbara for $526,000 in
l974 and made $127,000 in improvements eight years later. It
undoubtedly is valued at much more today. Their new home in Los
Angeles was purchased by friends for $2.5 million. The Reagans are
leasing it for a reported $15,000 a month.

   The Hungarian Social Democratic Party
held its first public meeting in 40 years, a source who attended it
said Friday.
   The party, chaired by Andras Revesz, 79, formally re-established
itself on Jan. 9, two days before Parliament adopted a law allowing
people to form associations but deferred another law on registering
and running political parties.
   Thursday's meeting of the party's organizing committee was
chaired by Revesz, the source said on condition of anonymity. It
decided that in coming weeks regional organizations would be set up
in Budapest districts and provincial areas.
   Working committees have been set up to draft a detailed party
program, the source said.
   On Jan. 13, the government daily Magyar Hirlap quoted Revesz as
saying that members believe the party has legally continued to exist
because it was never dissolved.
   ``In vain have they claimed for decades that there are no Social
Democrats'' in Hungary, Revesz was quoted as saying.
   Revesz says that only the party's extreme left united with the
Communists in the 1948 Communist takeover. But historical records
show that the entire party was forced to merge with the new
Communist Party, then called the Hungarian Working People's Party.

having bid farewell to the White House after eight tumultuous years
at the pinnacle of American power.
   ``When you have to stay eight years away from California except
for an occasional visit, you live in a perpetual state of
homesickness,'' Reagan said at an airport ceremony where he was
greeted by Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, comedian Rich Little and
actor Robert Stack.
   Little kidded the former president about having to find a job,
and Reagan _ the former actor _ quipped that he had a movie deal in
the works.
   ``I was asked to play a part in a remake of `Bedtime For Bonzo,'
only this time they wanted me to play Bonzo,'' Reagan said. ``He
wasn't a very freindly type.''
   During his Hollywood days Reagan played opposite a mean-tempered
chimpanzee in a series of ``Bonzo'' movies.
   The Reagans left Andrews Air Force Base, Md., at 1:10 p.m. EST
and flew home, both vowing to pursue objectives they battled for
during the president's two terms.
   The former first couple waved to a cheering crowd of about 2,000
at Andrews, and Reagan received a 21-gun salute as he reviewed a
platoon from each of the five branches of the military service.
Reagan did not address the crowd.
   With their dog, Rex, the Reagans boarded the plane that in the
previous eight years would have been designated Air Force One. A
sign in the crowd read ``So Long Gipper.''
   About an hour earlier Reagan stood by as George Bush took the
presidential oath of office at the Capitol. Bush, who fought Reagan
tirelessly for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 before
becoming his vice president, turned to Reagan after taking the
presidential oath and said, ``President Reagan, on behalf of the
American people I thank you for the wonderful things you have done
for America.''
   Reagan, asked while he was walking with Bush through the Rotunda
of the Capitol if he felt a sense of relief, said, ``No, but a great
pride in what's happening.''
   Following the solemn swearing-in ceremonies and Bush's acceptance
speech, Bush and his wife, Barbara, escorted the Reagans to the east
side of the Capitol to a waiting helicopter, where they said their
goodbyes with handshakes and kisses.
   As the Reagans stood in the doorway of the Marine helicopter,
Reagan turned and snapped a salute to Bush, who returned it.
   Asked by a reporter for his final thoughts, Reagan said only,
``Carry on.''
   The Bushes were joined by Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife,
Marilyn, who waved goodbye to the Reagans before their helicopter
lifted off and made a final sweep of the Mall and White House.
   Old foes at home and abroad praised Reagan, the first president
to serve eight years since Dwight D. Eisenhower gave up the office
to John F. Kennedy in 1961.
   He is, ``according to all external indications, leaving office as
a completely successful political figure,'' said Pravda, the
official voice of the Soviet Union, the nation that Reagan denounced
in 1983 as an ``evil empire.''
   Reagan began his final day in office with a nostalgic visit to
the Oval Office to make sure, according to his spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, that the presidential office was shipshape for his
successor.
   His national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, who so
often briefed Reagan there on trouble spots throughout the globe,
told him, ``The world is quiet today, Mr. President.''
   Powell's words were relayed to reporters by Fitzwater, who was
present during the Oval Office visit.
   Then, for the last time, Reagan made the walk through an arched
colonnade to the executive mansion, where he and Mrs. Reagan lived
and where the Bushes will now live.
   In a soft voice, he called out ``goodbye'' to members of the
White House staff and journalists seeing him off.
   Fitzwater said the last piece of paper the president signed was a
letter to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, thanking her for
her support. In London, Thatcher saluted the outgoing president as
``a true and perfect gentleman.''
   The first lady's press secretary, Elaine Crispen, said that after
returning to the executive mansion the president joined his wife in
walking hand in hand down the central hallway and spending a few
minutes in the Yellow Oval room overlooking the Washington Monument
and Jefferson Memorial.
   The Reagans also said their goodbyes to the domestic staff.
   Then, as their final social duty, they offered coffee and
pastries in the Blue Room to Bush; his wife, Barbara; Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle; his wife, Marilyn; and members of the
congressional delegation sent to escort them all to the Capitol for
the inauguration.
   At the Capitol, Reagan wore a black overcoat and white scarf in
chilly, overcast weather, and Mrs. Reagan wore her familiar red coat
as ``Hail to the Chief'' was played for the last time of the Reagan
presidency.
   Reagan flew on an Air Force plane designated SAM 27000. It was
the same plane he had flown thousands of miles on as Air Force One
when he was president. But Air Force One is a radio code reserved
for the plane on which the president flies and is not used when a
sitting president is not on the plane.
   From the Los Angeles airport, the Reagans were going by motorcade
to the home in the fashionable Bel-Air neighborhood that they are
renting from friends who bought it for $2.5 million. The pool of
reporters assigned to fly with him from Washington, however, were
not included in the motorcade as they are on presidential trips. As
a private citizen, Reagan gets to travel without them.
   Reagan has said he plans to speak out on behalf of causes he has
long favored, such as the line item veto for presidents and repeal
of the constitutional amendment limiting them to two terms.
   Mrs. Reagan has lent her support to a drug abuse treatment center
planned in a bankrupt hospital at Lake View Terrace, 15 miles north
of Bel-Air on the edge of the Angeles National Forest.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with two dead; details. No pickup</HEAD>

   Leftist guerrillas attacked the
downtown Treasury Police headquarters with mortar fire from the
backs of two pickup trucks Friday, killing two people and wounding
up to 10, authorities said.
   The trucks exploded when the mortars were fired, and the
explosions caused more casualties than the shrapnel-laden
projectiles, they reported.
   The Treasury Police press office identified one victim as a
guerrilla who fired a mortar that blew up before he could get away.
   His charred body lay about nine feet from the smoldering
wreckage. His name was not immediately available.
   Also killed was Hector Guardado, a wounded treasury policeman who
died in a hospital, the office said.
   Col. Heriberto Hernandez, commander of the Treasury Police, said
the vehicles exploded within minutes of each other at about 6:25
a.m., about 150 feet from the wall surrounding the base.
   Shortly after the attack, the rebels' clandestine radio Farabundo
Marti said their ``mobile artillery'' caused ``extensive damage'' to
the headquarters. But reporters allowed into the compound saw no
damage to installations, and Hernandez said no projectiles landed
inside.
   He said two soldiers were wounded by shrapnel, one seriously. He
also stopped a military vehicle as it left the base carrying two
badly burned men.
   Hernandez opened the vehicle's door so journalists could
photograph the two wounded men, who sat trembling, their clothes in
tatters and wide patches of skin peeled off their chests, backs and
arms.
   Hernandez said the men were civilians.
   Four more wounded civilians were taken away earlier by Red Cross
ambulances, according to other civilians.
   Residents of the poor Iberia neighborhood next to the base said a
woman was wounded by what appeared to be shrapnel. A man was also
reported wounded in an exchange of gunfire between guerrillas and a
Treasury Policeman.
   A civilian employee of the Treasury Police told journalists the
projectiles exploded in the air over the base. A Treasury Police
officer inside the compound confirmed that to The Associated Press.
   Neither would give his name.
   Apparently two projectiles exploded, one from each truck.
   The Marxist-led guerrillas launched similar attacks in November
and December on National Guard headquarters, the country's main air
force base and headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff _ all in or
just outside the capital.
   Ricardo Perdomo, president of the Central Elections Council,
asked the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front on Friday to
agree to a cease-fire so March 19 presidential elections can take
place smoothly.
   No immediate response came from the guerrillas, who in the past
increased activity during electoral events. The rebels say free and
fair elections are impossible in wartime, and that elections here in
this decade were designed to delude the citizenry into believing
their government is democratic.
   The insurgents contend El Salvador's U.S.-backed Ycivilian
administration is a facade for military-dominated government.
   The rebels want to share power in a transition government and
demand negotiations between the government and the Farabundo Marti
to end the war.
   An estimated 65,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in
the 9-year-old civil war.
   The Treasury Police force, originally formed to prevent
production and sale of homemade liquor, has taken on predominantly
military functions in the past 20 years and has a special
anti-subversive unit.

   A Boeing 737 jetliner ``lunged'' and lurched after
one of its engines fell off shortly after takeoff Friday, but the
pilot safely landed the plane and none of the 32 people aboard were
injured, officials said.
   Piedmont Airlines Flight 1480, with 27 passengers and five crew
members aboard, took off from O'Hare International Airport at 7:35
a.m. for a non-stop flight to Charlotte, N.C., officials said.
   ``At approximately 1,000 feet, or just moments after takeoff, the
right engine separated from the aircraft and landed on airport
property,'' said Dave Shipley, spokesman for Arlington, Va.-based
USAir Inc., which owns Piedmont.
   ``I was scared to death,'' said passenger Dante Pacioni, 56, a
private pilot who had a view of the wing that lost the engine.
   The plane ``lunged to the left'' when the engine broke away, he
said, but the pilot maintained control and guided the craft back to
an emergency landing at O'Hare.
   Elsewhere, a wing panel fell from an Eastern Airlines Boeing 757
near Birmingham, Ala., Thursday night. In Buena Vista, Colo., a
commuter pilot glided his twin-engine plane through a mountain pass
to safely land in a cornfield Friday after both engines failed.
   In Chicago, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort
Edelstein said the 737's engine landed in a nearby field.
   ``The engines are designed to detach if there is severe movement
(such as vibrations) happening,'' said David Jimenez, a spokesman
for Boeing Commercial Airplanes in Seattle.
   The Piedmont plane, built in 1981, had gone through 21,000
takeoffs and landing cycles and was considered a relatively young
plane, he said.
   The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board were
investigating the accident, said Tim Curtis, an FAA regional duty
officer in Des Plaines, Ill.
   Passengers from Flight 1480 were returned to the terminal by bus
and many left later on another flight, officials said.
   The incident delayed a number of other flights at the nation's
busiest airport, and there were some cancellations, officials said.
   In Atlanta, the wing panel that fell from Eastern's Boeing 757 on
Thursday night was the third such incident on that type of aircraft
and the subject of a service bulletin, government investigators said
Friday.
   The wing panel, made mainly of fiberglass, fell from Eastern
Flight 83 bound for Los Angeles with 110 people aboard. The plane
returned to Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta. No injuries
were reported.
   Boeing has issued a special service bulletin on the panel,
indicating some problems with its installation, said Jay Golden,
chief of the Atlanta office of the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   No injuries were reported in Buena Vista, Colo., after the
emergency landing of the United Express commuter plane with 26
passengers aboard.
   Pilot Bob White, 55, of Denver, brought the plane down on an
unpaved county road because he had lost too much altitude to make it
to the Buena Vista airport a mile away, said United Express
spokeswoman Pat Lee.
   The plane was in the air about half an hour when the first engine
failed, and the second engine went out when the plane was turning
back to Denver, Lee said.

<HEAD>Thatcher Lists Conditions For Attending Moscow Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that
Britain will attend a conference on human rights in Moscow in 1991
only if the Soviet Union releases all religious and political
prisoners.
   Britain and the United States initially refused to attend the
conference. But after reforms initiated by Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, they said this month that they agreed in principle to go.
   Mrs. Thatcher listed the conditions in a written reply to a
legislator's question in the House of Commons. Other conditions
included:
   _ Implementation of promised changes in Soviet criminal law, with
the abolition or amendment of political and religious articles.
   _ Effective guarantees of free speech, freedom of religion,
freedom to emigrate and genuine independence of the courts.
   _ A guarantee that the conference would be run on exactly similar
lines to East-West meetings held in the West.
   _ Maintenance of existing improvements.
   ``All of this assumes that nothing has happened in the meantime
to seriously undermine the greatly improved state of East-West
relations,'' Mrs. Thatcher added.

   A panel formed to investigate the slaying that
touched off this week's racial violence met for the first time
Friday as civic and community leaders sought to maintain calm for
Super Bowl weekend.
   ``We can't go on having racial disturbances every five years _ if
this goes on, the whole city is going to burn down,'' said the Rev.
Richard Barry, chairman of the 11-member panel of police officers
and black residents.
   The board will investigate the death of Clement Lloyd, 23, an
unarmed black motorcyclist shot in the head by a Hispanic police
officer Monday.
   Riots triggered by the shooting left one man dead and seven
others shot in two black neighborhoods. Thirteen buildings were
torched and others looted, authorities said.
   ``I'm hoping we'll begin to deal seriously with this community's
problems and do more than just put some iodine on its cancers,''
Barry said. After an introductory session, the group agreed to hold
its first working meeting on Monday.
   William Lozano, 29, the officer who shot Lloyd, remained on
suspension with pay during an internal police investigation. His
attorney, Roy Black, said he expects the Colombian-born officer to
be indicted in the slaying.
   ``He's being made a scapegoat to somehow save the Super Bowl,
save civic pride, to stop the riots,'' said Black, who said the
officer fired in self-defense as the motorcycle bore down on him.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez announced a 10-point program he called
``Miami's comeback plan,'' aimed at giving an economic boost to
black areas and improving police-community relations.
   The plan includes special tax districts, business and job
creation programs and police sensitivity and screening efforts. He
acknowledged that it was only a partial solution and some of the
programs may fail.
   ``I guess it's better to dare a little bit,'' the mayor said.
   Suarez also met Friday with Yolanda King, daughter of slain civil
rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King, and about 200 black leaders
and school children at a Liberty City community center, joining them
in a call for non-violent resolution to the city's racial problems.
   ``We know that a little bit of anger can have good results, and
we hope to turn what was more than a little bit of anger expressed
in our community into many, many good results,'' the mayor said.
   Black leaders urged Suarez to act quickly without additional
committees or studies, and said that without real economic change,
Miami's impoverished black neighborhoods would continue to erupt.
   ``It's cancerous, and it's going to eat this town alive,'' said
black Dade County Commissioner Barbara Carey.
   Normal activity resumed Friday in the black neighborhoods plagued
by violence earlier in the week, with police relaxing the perimeter
around the Overtown neighborhood and opening up highway exits into
the area.
   Most of the 372 people arrested in the riots remained in jail,
unable to make cash bail of $250 or more. A state survey found that
106 of 185 suspects whose backgrounds were checked had long criminal
records averaging 11 arrests each.
   As the crisis ebbed in the inner-city neighborhoods, security
concerns turned to Sunday's Super Bowl. Three hundred Metro-Dade
police officers in uniform and plainclothes will guard Joe Robbie
Stadium, said police spokesman Jim Hutton.
   Only people with tickets will be allowed past the parking gates.
No one has applied for a march or demonstration permit, police said,
and if protesters do show up and obstruct the entrance, they will be
moved out quickly, Hutton said.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a New York activist known for his
involvement in the Tawana Brawley case, was to arrive in Miami late
Friday.
   He announced a rally for Saturday and a tour of Overtown and
Liberty City aimed at drawing attention to the plight of blacks in
Miami and around the nation.
   Miami officials say such demonstrations should not be aimed at
them because the city lacks the money to make any meaningful
improvements in black neighborhoods.
   ``The city government has very limited resources,'' City Manager
Cesar Odio said, noting property taxes were already close to their
legal cap. ``We're almost taxed out. There's no more we can do with
taxes.''

   Bail was revoked Friday for a Korean-American
businessman charged with trying to export nerve gas, possibly to
Iran, after prosecutors said classified national-security documents
were found on his desk.
   The papers, in English and Korean and marked confidential and
classified, were discovered in the Summit office of Juwhan Yun,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Singer said in seeking revocation of
his $2 million bail.
   Ms. Singer and Customs agent Frank P. Ventura, who testified
about the documents, declined to discuss their contents in the
hearing at which Yun, 48, of Short Hills, sought release.
   U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges, who set the bail Tuesday, asked
Ms. Singer whether espionage was involved and she declined to
comment.
   Ms. Singer told the magistrate that Yun may by more likely to
flee because the documents indicated possible ties with foreign
governments which may have an interest in keeping the case from
going to trial.
   Hedges agreed, saying the documents indicated Yun was either
passing them on or using them in his import-export business, and
revoked Yun's bail.
   A grand jury also issued a two-count indictment against Yun and a
Briton, who was named as a co-conspirator in the alleged nerve gas
exportation scheme.
   Ventura said intelligence officials from Fort Monmouth, N.J.,
identified the documents as coming from the Joint Electronics
Warfare Command.
   The officials did not explain the nature or responsibility of the
command, but said the documents concerned national security.
   ``He was apparently in the process of using them,'' Ms. Singer
said. She did not elaborate.
   Ms. Singer disclosed the existence of the documents after Yun's
attorney, Stephen Dratch, came to court to say his client was able
to meet bail, backed by six properties posted by acquaintances.
   On Friday, the prosecutor said the documents might expose Yun to
a more serious charge of unauthorized possession of secret
documents, which carries a 10-year prison term. Ventura said Yun did
not have security clearance.
   Yun faces charges of conspiracy to violate the Arms Export
Control Act by trying to arrange shipments of 500 quarter-ton bombs
of sarin, a nerve gas.
   The grand jury indictment named Yun and London businessman
Charles Caplan on charges of conspiracy to violate the Arms Export
Control Act and attempting to violate that law.
   If convicted, the conspiracy count carries a maximum five-year
prison term and the other carries a 10-year term. The indictment
revealed no new details in the case.
   Ms. Singer told Hedges on Tuesday that Yun was preparing for an
around-the-world trip that included stops in China, Iran, Europe and
South Korea.
   Yun was arrested Jan. 12 at a meeting with an undercover Customs
agent whom he apparently believed to be an arms supplier.
   Yun came to the United States in 1972 and was naturalized six
years later. He received a master's degree from the American
Graduate School of International Management and founded his
business, now called Komex International Corp., in 1980.
   Caplan, accused of negotiating with Yun for the nerve gas, was
charged with conspiracy. Authorities said they are studying the
possibility of his extradition.

<HEAD>I.B.I. Owner: Libyan Plant Not Designed For Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a defunct Frankfurt
company under criminal investigation for allegedly helping Libya
build a suspected poison gas factory denied Friday that the plant
was designed for chemical weapons.
   ``There aren't any chemical weapons there,'' Ihsan Barbouti, who
operated I.B.I. Engineering, said in an interview with West
Germany's ZDF television network.
   ``I wish I could take two or three American experts to Libya. If
they then still insist that it was designed to produce chemical
weapons, then I will take responsibility.''
   The United States contends the plant in Rabta, 60 miles south of
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, is capable of producing poison gas.
Libya says the plant produces pharmaceuticals.
   The ZDF interview was conducted in German and English at the
Iraqi-born Barbouti's London apartment.
   Barbouti said he knew the president of another West German
company under investigation ``very well,'' but could not say whether
the company, Imhausen-Chemie, had provided equipment for the plant.
   He also denied that I.B.I. was directly involved in building the
plant.
   ``My office in Frankfurt only sent certain building materials to
Libya. That's all. Libya built it,'' he said. ``We had nothing to do
with the chemical (part).''
   He said West German authorities had not contacted him about his
role in the project, but that he would be ``happy to talk to them.''
The Frankfurt prosecutor's office last week launched a criminal
investigation against the company, and its records were seized.
   Barbouti said that as far as he knew, the plant was designed to
produce pharmaceuticals.
   I.B.I. is believed to have coordinated the construction of the
plant by securing contracts with West German firms.
   West German officials say they still have no evidence that export
laws were broken.
   The government has said it plans to toughen export laws to ensure
that West German firms do not take part in the construction of
plants that could produce chemical weapons.

<HEAD>British Railroad Pension Fund Making Millions From Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A much-mocked investment in art by the pension fund
of Britain's state rail network is expected to make many millions
this spring with the sale of 25 paintings and drawings by
impressionist and modern masters.
   The works by 14 artists such as Paul Cezanne, Pierre-Auguste
Renoir and Claude Monet were bought between 1974 and 1979 for about
$7 million.
   They are expected to make up to $43 million in London April 4.
   The auctioneers of Sotheby's, handling the sale for the British
Rail Pension Fund, are sending the pictures on tour to Paris Feb.
21-22, New York Feb. 27-March 1, Los Angeles March 3-6 and Tokyo
March 10-15.
   ``This is the first big collection of pictures we shall sell this
year, and the prices will indicate the state of the market for the
world's most popular paintings,'' Michel Strauss, the firm's expert
on the period, said in an interview Friday.
   He said the top price could be $7 million to $9 million for
Renoir's ``La Promenade,'' a straw-hatted man helping a woman in a
white dress up a woodland path. It cost $1.2 million in 1976.
   A 1905 blue-period work of Pablo Picasso, ``Young Man in Blue,''
bought privately for an undisclosed sum, could bring up to $7
million.
   There is also an 1888 ink drawing of cottages by Vincent van
Gogh, and portraits of Cezanne by Renoir and Camille Pissarro.
   Strauss said he recommended the pictures to the fund originally
as good investments.
   From the time the program began in 1974 to the time it stopped in
1982, the fund was criticized by financial commentators for going
outside its field of expertise and being advised by Sotheby's on
buying 2,700 works of art _ paintings, antiquities, furniture,
silver, porcelain, books and manuscripts _ for about $9 million.
   That was 1 percent of the value of all its investments for
British Rail pensions at that time.
   The fund exhibited many of the art works in museums. It has sold
1,000 of them for $27 million.
   Strauss said the return on the fund's art investments has been
the same as for real estate, higher than government bonds and lower
than stocks.
   Strauss, 52, who has spent 27 years at Sotheby's, said 10 percent
of the buyers of impressionists and modern artists in London and New
York are American, 25 percent are Japanese and 65 percent are
European or Europe-based.
   ``What's different about this sale is that the pictures belong to
a single institution and are stamped with one person's taste: mine.
I chose them and I still love them,'' Strauss said.

<HEAD>Former Mayor Franck Romain Indicted For Massacre</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADD 2 grafs to UPDATE activists released</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Former Mayor Franck Romain has been
indicted for involvement in a church massacre, radio stations said
Friday, three weeks after the military gave him safe conduct from
Haiti.
   According to Haitian law, government prosecutor Jacaman Charles
must subpoena Romain to appear before a criminal court for trial. If
he does not appear, he will be tried in absentia.
   Magistrate Georges Moise issued the indictment on Wednesday, said
Radio Haiti-Inter, an independent station.
   Romain, a former army colonel, police chief and executioner under
the dictatorship of the Duvalier family, is believed to have
orchestrated a Sept. 11 massacre of 12 parishioners during a Mass at
St. Jean Bosco Roman Catholic Church.
   Witnesses identified his City Hall employees among the attackers,
who also wounded 70 parishioners and burned down the church in the
capital's La Saline slum.
   Under Haitian law, the examining magistrate and government
prosecutor are not obliged to reveal specific charges before trial.
The radio said Romain was indicted for his ``implication in the St.
Jean Bosco church massacre.''
   Charles is expected to outline specific charges before trial. He
has refused to give further details on the case.
   On Sept. 17, rank-and-file soldiers, saying they were disgusted
by the massacre and other acts of state-sponsored violence, ousted
Haiti's military leader, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Romain sought asylum in the Dominican Embassy the same day. The
nation's new leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, allowed him to flee to
the Dominican Republic on Dec. 31, raising a storm of protest by
human rights, civic and opposition leaders in Haiti.
   There is no extradition treaty between Haiti and the Dominican
Republic, which share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola.
   Namphy came to power in 1986 after Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to
exile in France, ending a 29-year family dynasty.
   The Roman Catholic-run Radio Soleil said activists Yves Sanon,
Alain Zephyr, and Reynald Paul were released Friday, one day after
they were arrested during an argument with police. It said their
case will be heard Monday. Police said they assaulted a police guard.
   The three went to the downtown Police Investigation Bureau to ask
about two colleagues _ Vesnel Jean-Francois and Roland Pierre _
arrested Monday night while distributing leaflets protesting the
cost of living. Jean-Francois and Pierre were freed Thursday.

   The last Nicaraguan immigrants packed up their
belongings and left the Bobby Maduro Stadium on Friday as the park
was prepared for the arrival of the Baltimore Orioles' baseball
spring training camp.
   The stadium, in an industrial part of the inner city, became a
shelter for a growing influx of Nicaraguans. Refugees entering Texas
called it their south Florida destination, possibly not realizing
the Orioles were due Jan. 25.
   The Central Americans began arriving from southern Texas by the
busload last week, following a federal judge's ruling that the
government could not keep them there while processing their
applications for political asylum.
   The Nicaraguans maintain they are fleeing the oppression of the
leftist Sandinista government. The Immigration and Naturalization
Service says the immigrants are ineligible for asylum if they
actually are fleeing bad economic conditions in their homeland,
which has been hurt by a U.S. trade embargo.
   Officials expect 100,000 Central Americans to arrive here in the
next year.
   On Friday, the last of the Nicaraguans were being moved to
apartments rented for a month by the Homeless Project for the City
of Miami.
   ``This is a lot like home for me,'' said Felix Mendoza, 21, of
the stadium. ``You know how much Nicaraguans love baseball and they
always used to go to the games at home. After I get a job and some
money I'd like to come back for a game.''
   Mark Coates, assistant coordinator of the Homeless Project, said
about 55 Nicaraguans stayed Thursday night, and would be gone by
Friday. Others had left in the last week.
   As many as 150 homeless people, but not the Nicaraguan refugees,
will be allowed to remain at the stadium until Jan. 23.
   ``It's been an emotional time for them,'' Coates said of the
Nicaraguans. ``They've had to move two times and most of them just
want to get their life going.''
   The refugees' first month's rent was paid with $30,000 in private
donations, as well as $70,000 collected in telethons by two Spanish
television stations, said Pablo Canton, Miami's assistant community
development director.
   In a related development, U.S. District Judge James Kehoe in
Miami ruled Thursday that immigration officials are under no
immediate obligation to give more than 30,000 Nicaraguan refugees
permission to work in the United States.
   Kehoe directed lawyers for both sides to file briefs, and said he
would hold a full hearing to resolve the issue.

<TEXT>
   Beatrice Lillie, a blithe comedian in dozens of
Broadway and London shows, died peacefully Friday after a life of
artistic triumph and private tragedy. She was 94.
   Miss Lillie _ Lady Peel after her marriage in 1920 to Sir Robert
Peel, a descendant of a 19th century prime minister _ died at her
home in Henley-on-Thames.
   ``She just went this morning, peacefully,'' said John Phillip
Huck, her associate for 40 years and, since 1977, her guardian.
   Miss Lillie suffered a stroke in 1975, and required constant care
in her later years.
   Her perfomances were marvels of improvisation, and she was a
master of the eloquent putdown, often delivered with a twirl of a
long cigarette holder.
   ``Her art is as elusive and astonishing,'' a reviewer once said,
``as the contradictory elements in her appearance, which include the
trim sociable Lady Peel, the improbable nose and determined chin of
an elegant clown, the sad cool eyes of a satirist, and the little
burnished head and shining, scrubbed look of the choirboy who gets
all the plum solos.''
   She was, in the title of her 1973 autobiography, ``Every Other
Inch a Lady.''
   After working with Noel Coward in the Broadway production of
``The Year of Grace'' in 1928, she declared, ``We loathed each other
with every quivering fiber of our beings.''
   They were, in fact, friends and mutual admirers, but Coward
explained in Life magazine in 1964 that her inspirations could be a
torment.
   ``She may stray widely from the written script, she may
interpolate words and phrases of her own which are far from the
author's intentions _ and, as often as not, entirely irrelevant,''
Coward wrote. ``But the instinctive accuracy of her touch and
impeccable taste sweep the audience into transports of laughter.''
   ``If I suddenly did everything on cue, I might throw the whole
cast off,'' she told Associated Press Drama Writer William Glover
during the run of ``High Spirits,'' her last Broadway appearance in
1964-65.
   The musical was based on Coward's ``Blithe Spirit'' and was
directed by him.
   Coward remained part of her circle of friends, which also
included George Bernard Shaw and the young Princess Margaret, to
whom Miss Lilly taught her trick of swinging a long string of pearls
around her neck like a hula-hoop.
   She was a tireless entertainer of troops during World War II, the
conflict in which her only child, Robert, was killed. The telegram
with the awful news that his ship had gone down arrived at an
opening night in Manchester, England.
   ``Don't talk about it, darlings,'' Miss Lillie said in a note
posted backstage. ``Now let's get on with it.''
   Beatrice Gladys Lillie was born May 29, 1894, in Toronto. She was
exposed to music through the concert singing of her mother.
   Young Beatrice was dismissed from her church choir at age 8, she
recalled, for making depressing faces at the congregation during
hymns.
   At 15, accompanied by her mother and sister, an aspiring pianist,
she went to Britain in hope of making a singing career.
   Her first appearance on a British stage came in 1914, and a
decade later she made her Broadway debut in a review produced by
Andre Charlot.
   Before Broadway, however, she married Peel in 1920, had a son two
years later and briefly retired from the stage. Her husband died in
1934.
   In 1932, Miss Lillie took a dramatic role as the nurse in the New
York premiere of George Bernard Shaw's ``Too True to be Good,'' but
then returned to working in reviews. Those included ``At Home
Abroad'' in 1935, ``The Show Is On'' in 1936 and Coward's ``Set to
Music'' in 1939.
   In 1939, she also appeared in London in ``All Clear.''
   She returned to the New York stage in 1944 with ``Seven Lively
Arts'' and was in ``Inside U.S.A.'' in 1948.
   From 1952 to 1956, she toured the world in a one-woman act, ``An
Evening with Beatrice Lillie,'' which won a Tony Award in 1953.
   In 1958 she starred in London in ``Auntie Mame.''
   Her film credits including ``Exit Smiling'' in 1927, ``Around the
World in Eighty Days'' in 1956 and ``Thoroughly Modern Millie'' in
1967.
   Huck said a funeral service was tentatively planned for Jan. 30
at St. Margaret's Church in Harpsden, near her home in Oxfordshire.

<HEAD>Namibia Peacekeeping Force Cut Contemplated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African nations and non-aligned countries
met on Friday to find ways to prevent a proposed U.N. peacekeeping
force for Namibia from being substantially cut.
   The original U.N. plan called for 7,500 peacekeeping troops to
oversee Namibia's transition to independence after 74 years of South
African rule. But the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France,
and China object to the cost, estimated at $700 million.
   Those five nations pay 58 percent of all peacekeeping costs.
   A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
cost of the Namibian mission now has been cut to about $490 million.
   A group of 17 non-aligned nations, chaired by Zimbabwe and
including many African countries, met privately Friday to consider
ways to persuade the U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
to send all 7,500 peacekeepers and cut costs in other ways.
   Ambassadors from the non-aligned nations would not comment on the
results of their meeting, but several said privately that they
understand senior U.N. officials have advocated cutting the Namibian
peacekeeping force to 4,000 or 4,500 soldiers.
   The non-aligned nations fear South Africa may destabilize the new
Namibian elections, possibly by encouraging anti-Marxist rebels in
southern Angola to cross the border into Namibia.
   Perez de Cuellar is to present a report early next week
suggesting ways to cut the cost of the mission without endangering
its success.
   The U.N. chief's special representative for Namibia, Martti
Ahtisaari, said no decision has been made yet on troop strength
levels or other specifics in the plan.
   Meanwhile, other officials said U.S., Soviet, Cuban, Angolan and
South African military and political officials will hold talks
Sunday through Tuesday on the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola.
   South Africa has agreed to give up Namibia in exchange for the
withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   Cuba, Angola and South Africa must form a military commission to
monitor the Cuban withdrawal, a task they may tackle during the
meetings.
   They will also discuss South Africa's cooperation with the U.N.
independence plan for Namibia, a former German colony Pretoria has
ruled since capturing it in 1915 during World War I.
   Under the accords, South Africa has pledged to cooperate with a
one-year U.N. plan to monitor free elections for a Namibian
Constituent Assembly, which will draft a constitution and organize
an independent government.
   The process is to begin April 1, with the elections scheduled for
the first week of November.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan Massive Construction Program For Disputed Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities are planning construction
projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars in a disputed region
as part of a plan to ease ethnic tensions between Armenians and
Azerbaijanis, Izvestia said Friday.
   The area, Nagorno-Karabakh, is a largely Armenian enclave within
Azerbaijan that has been the focus of ethnic violence for the past
year. Armenians want it shifted to the control of Armenia.
   The government Presidium last week ordered the area placed under
the control of an eight-person ``special administration'' team.
   Izvestia, a Soviet government-run newspaper, said the new
administration wants the massive building program to renew neglected
housing, roads, schools, stadiums, pools and businesses.
   The newspaper also said the officials plan to separate the
Nagorno-Karabakh budget from that of the rest of Azerbaijan. Such a
``regional accounting'' program is one of Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's experiments in economic decentralization.
   The eight members of the new administration include
representatives of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee,
central trade unions and the heavy machine-tool ministry, a general
in the internal troops, and three local officials from
Nagorno-Karabakh, Izvestia said.

   A white supremacist vowed to speak alone on the
courthouse steps in mostly white Forsyth County, after his second
bid to stage a rally and march there was rejected Friday by a
federal judge.
   Richard Barrett, a Mississippi lawyer, filed a lawsuit demanding
permission to rally his Nationalist Movement followers Saturday
morning in a parking lot at Forsyth County High School.
   The county north of Atlanta was the scene of civil rights marches
and confrontations with white supremacists two years ago.
   On Thursday, U.S. District Judge William C. O'Kelley dismissed
Barrett's first lawsuit demanding permission for a march in Cumming,
the Forsyth County seat. Permit or not, Barrett said he will appear
Saturday in Cumming.
   The Nationalist Movement already had permits for a rally and
march Saturday afternoon in Atlanta.
   ``We've said all along that the fight for freedom is certainly
not going to be won in the courts,'' Barrett said Friday. ``It's
going to be won lawfully and peacefully in the streets.''
   ``At 8 a.m. I'll be in Cumming, just by myself _ not to violate
any ordinance, to deliver a eulogy on the courthouse steps in honor
of those who stood up against the invasion by Hosea Williams in
1987,'' he said.
   He was referring to a January 1987 march by Williams and other
civil rights activists in the county. The marchers were attacked by
white supremacists, and the incident led to a huge civil rights
march in the county the following week.
   In Atlanta, police and six state agencies prepared for the march,
hoping to avoid a repeat of last summer's confrontation between
white supremacists and counterdemonstrators on the eve of the
Democratic National Convention.
   Barrett said the Atlanta rally and march will be a restaging of
that July 17 march, which was halted by police when about 500
counterdemonstrators showed up and violence appeared imminent.
   He said he planned Saturday's activities to counter the
celebrations this week marking the 60th birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. He has adopted the slogan ``No King Over Us'' for
the march.
   Barrett's group predicted 500 to 1,000 participants.
   At least two anti-racist groups planned rallies to denounce the
Nationalist Movement and the Ku Klux Klan.
   One group, the Partisan Defense Committee, obtained a city permit
for a rally at Woodruff Park in downtown Atlanta. The second, the Ad
Hoc Committee Against the Klan, announced plans for a rally at the
Capitol.

   In the blink of an eye, in a ceremony as old as
the Republic, Ronald Reagan is transformed from Mr. President, the
most powerful man in the world, to Mr. Citizen.
   He keeps the title as an honorific, all the presidents do. But
the mantle of office falls away completely. He becomes nothing
ex-officio, he casts no votes, he has no say, and his counsel _ if
it is sought at all _ is sought as a courtesy.
   He becomes a member of a most exclusive club, that of
ex-presidents, which will number more than three on Inauguration Day
for the first time since 1861. The others are Reagan's immediate
predecessors, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford.
   Ronald Reagan has joked about what he will do immediately.
   ``As soon as I get home to California,'' he said, ``I plan to
lean back, kick up my feet and take a long nap.''
   That won't be so different from other recent presidents.
   Harry Truman took the train home to Independence and said the
first thing he did was to carry the luggage into the attic. The next
morning he was up at 7:30 _ having slept unusually late _ and walked
into his front yard to get the paper.
   ``My return to ordinary citizenship began a new life filled with
new meaning,'' he said afterward. ``After all the crowds and furor,
the whole business did not seem so easy. Were the people going to
let me become a private citizen? Or was I still going to have to
live up to the title of Mr. President that the people insisted on
using?''
   Truman was blessed with living in less dangerous times. At first,
his only added security was the fence that the Secret Service had
put up around the house at 219 North Delaware, and a former highway
patrolman who doubled as chauffeur and bodyguard. He took his
morning walks down to the town square often unnoticed. If you wanted
to talk to him, you had to do it at 120 paces a minute, but you
could do it. Only in his later years were laws passed that beefed up
his protection at government expense.
   Dwight D. Eisenhower, who hated top hats, had dictated the
wearing of homburgs at his own inauguration. John F. Kennedy, aware
of that, mischievously ruled that top hats be worn at his
swearing-in and Eisenhower, as the outgoing president, was forced to
comply.
   No wonder he told reporters, as he was driven out of Washington,
that it was wonderful to shed the burdens of the presidency. He and
Mamie were driven in a four-car convoy to their farm in Gettysburg,
Pa. The next day he attended a dinner thrown in his honor by the
townsfolk and a couple of days later he was in Albany, Ga., shooting
quail.
   The latter was in the tradition set by Theodore Roosevelt who
went on an African safari after leaving the jungles of Washington.
   Ford didn't bother to go home. He stayed long enough to hear
Jimmy Carter's inaugural address, got his helicopter pilot to make
one last swing over the White House and the Capitol, flew to
California and before the day was out was hitting golf balls off a
practice tee.
   The next day he was Arnold Palmer's partner in the Bing Crosby
Pro-Am Tournament at Pebble Beach. Ford told reporters he thought he
had prepared himself well for the swift switch in power. ``We
certainly took the attitude that our time had ended and President
Carter's time had begun,'' Ford said.
   But he wiped away a tear or two at the airport, saying ``I don't
deny I got a little sentimental, but I tried not to expose it, to
keep it within myself.''
   Carter's leave-taking and Nixon's _ for different reasons _ were
the most traumatic.
   Carter had stayed up all night handling final details of a
complicated deal worked out with Iran to gain freedom for 52
American hostages who had been held hostage for 444 days. He
catnapped on the Oval Office couch and left for the Reagan
swearing-in only at the last minute.
   En route to the Capitol, Carter got word the Iranians had agreed
_ but the first planeload did not take off from Tehran until five
minutes into the Reagan presidency.
   The 39th president flew to Georgia in Air Force One and to Plains
in a helicopter. At 4:30 a.m. the next day he boarded the same
aircraft for Germany to greet the returning hostages. Carter flew
back home after a few hours on the ground.
   Nixon, too, had a fitful last night in the White House. On Aug.
8, 1974, he had told the nation that because the Watergate scandal
had eroded his political muscle ``I shall resign the presidency
effective at noon tomorrow.''
   Afterward, his family consoled him and Nixon went to bed with the
sound of protesters outside chanting what his daughter described as
``their sick message.'' In the morning, he had corned beef hash and
poached eggs alone in the Lincoln sitting room, signed a message of
resignation addressed to the secretary of state, and said a tearful
goodbye to his administration.
   ``This was the nightmare end of a long dream,'' he wrote later.
``I had come so far from the little house in Yorba Linda (Calif.) to
this great house in Washington.''
   He, too, flew back home on Air Force One, to years of
self-imposed exile before he ventured forth again.
   ``There was no talk, there were no tears left,'' Nixon said of
seeing the White House retreating in the distance. He leaned his
head back against the seat and closed his eyes, then heard his wife
saying, to no one in particular, ``It's so sad. It's so sad.''
   Lyndon B. Johnson flew to Texas immediately after he left office
on Jan. 20, 1969, landing in Austin before a crowd estimated at
approximately 10,000 and then going on to the LBJ ranch in Johnson
City.
   In retirement, Johnson worked on his library at the University of
Texas in Austin and writing his memoirs until his death on Jan. 22,
1973.

<TEXT>
   The government on Friday began refusing to
allow foreigners to adopt Ecuadorean children after police uncovered
a ring that allegedly kidnapped babies and sold them overseas.
   Deputy Secretary of Social Welfare Elsa Maria Castro said
adoptions by foreign parents were being halted pending a review of
Ecuadorean adoption practices.
   The decision was announced after police this week arrested a
Quito lawyer and four women in connection with irregularities
surrounding the adoption of 30 Ecuadorean children since early 1988.
   The children, who ranged in age from one month to three years,
were adopted by parents in Great Britain and Norway, police said.
   Police allege that a baby-trafficking ring would kidnap children
in Quito's bustling open-air markets and falsify identity papers
certifying the children as orphans.
   The children were then adopted by foreign parents via the
Ministry of Social Welfare, which is in charge of Ecuadorean
adoptions, they said.
   The adoption process in Ecuador involves prospective parents
retaining a lawyer to serve as an intermediary with the government.
   Castro did not say when adoptions would be resumed.
   Police identified the reputed ring leader of the baby ring as
attorney Jorge Moncayo. The four women were not named.
   Moncayo, in an interview published Friday in the Quito newspaper
Hoy, denied any wrongdoing and was quoted as saying that he has been
arranging legal adoptions for several years.
   His lawyer, Jorge Andrade, charged that women who brought
children to Moncayo had previously falsified their papers without
Moncayo's knowledge.

   A West German art student suspected of stealing
artworks worth about $3.2 million told police he took the
masterpieces because he just wanted to ``admire them quietly at
home,'' authorities said Friday.
   Police officials said 23-year-old Florian Fielder of Munich told
them he had no intention of selling the paintings, drawings and
other art objects _ including works by Albrecht Durer and
Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot.
   Stolen objects from the Carnavalet Museum, the Marmatton Museum,
the Petit Palais, the Guimet Museum and several other museums in and
around Paris were found during a search of Fielder's Paris
apartment. Police displayed the objects for news photographers on
Friday.
   ``I just wanted to admire them quietly at home,'' one
investigator quoted Fielder as saying.
   Investigators said Fielder, with recommendations from his art
professors, obtained short-term unpaid jobs at the museums, and used
the opportunity for access to take works he liked.
   He was arrested Wednesday at the famous Louvre, where he recently
started such an unpaid job, and was held for questioning while the
case against him was prepared, the officials said.

   George Herbert Walker Bush was inaugurated the

``We can make it better.''
   Then, hand-in-hand with his wife, Barbara, the new president rode
_ and for a time walked _ at the head of his own parade, home in
splendid sunshine to the splendid misery of the White House. An
estimated 300,000 people exchanged his joyous waves along the way.
   In an inaugural speech long on inspiration and short on
initiatives, Bush offered a symbolic hand of bipartisanship to the
opposition Democrats and asked the nation to put aside materialism.
``We are not the sums of our possesions,'' he said.
   ``A new breeze is blowing _ and a nation refreshed by freedom
stands ready to push on: there is new ground to be broken, and new
action to be taken,'' Bush declared.
   In slight chill at three minutes past noon, Bush took the oath of
office, preserving the conservative custody of the White House
claimed eight years earlier by Ronald Reagan. After saluting Bush
from the steps of his helicopter, Reagan flew off with his beloved
Nancy to retirement in California. Like his recent predecessors, the
departing president took a final, airborne pass over the White House.
   Reagan, aboard the presidential jetliner, told reporters his
departure was ``a time of tears for a great many people and
certainly for us ... it was hard to say goodbye.'' But California
``isn't a place in my mind, it's a way of life, so that's the sweet
part of the bittersweet experience.''
   Reagan became the first president since another Republican,
Dwight D. Eisenhower, who held office from 1953 to 1961, to serve
two full terms and the first president in 60 years to turn the White
House over to a successor of his own party.
   ``My friends, we have work to do,'' Bush said in his 20-minute
speech. ``We have more will than wallet, but will is what we need.''
   He asked Americans to help him steer the nation on a course of
``high moral principle,'' to battle the domestic scourges of
homelessness, drug addiction and crime, and tyranny and terrorism
abroad.
   Republican Bush told Democratic congressional leaders that his
would be ``the age of the offered hand.'' To the world, he said, the
hand could be ``a reluctant fist ... strong'' and could ``be used
with great effect.''
   With his oath Bush, 64, the fourth oldest man to be sworn in as
president, crowned a heroic odyssey of government service, personal
setback and triumph. It took him from privileged home of an Eastern
financier and senator to aerial combat in the Pacific, from sweaty
work and heady gambles in the Texas oil fields to diplomacy in
China, from political defeat to presidential landslide.
   Moments before Bush took the rostrum on the Capitol's West
Portico, Dan Quayle, the 41-year-old former senator from Indiana,
was sworn in as the new vice president by Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   With the heralding of trumpets, Bush was introduced one last time
as ``the vice president of the United States.'' He paused for a word
with his 87-year-old mother, Dorothy, and then shook hands with
Reagan.
   Then, as an estimated 200,000 people looked on from the Capitol
grounds, Bush, in navy pinstriped business suit, placed his left
hand upon two Bibles, one used by George Washington, one by his own
family, and recited his oath:
   ``I, George Herbert Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will
fiathfully execute the office of president of the United States, and
will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States.''
   Like all his predecessors, he added: ``So help me God.''
   He began his address with a tribute to the departing Reagan,
``who has earned a lasting place in our heaerts and in our history.''
   But Reagan left behind some major challenges for the new
president, particularly the massive national debt, $2.6 trillion,
and spending and trade deficits running $150 billion each per year.
Bush barely touched upon those issues.
   ``We have a deficit to bring down,'' he acknowledged.``We will
make the hard choices, looking at what we have and perhaps
allocating it differently, making our decisions based on honest need
and prudent safety.''
   ``And then we will do the wisest thing of all: we will turn to
the only resource we have that in times of need always grows: the
goodness and courage of the American people.''
   ``For this is the thing,'' Bush said. ``This is the age of the
offered hand.''
   Bush said Republicans and Democrats have often been too
mistrustful, an attitude he traced back to the Vietnam war. ``The
final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to
be sundered by a memory,'' he said.
   With that Bush symbolically extended his hand to the speaker of
the House, Jim Wright of Texas, and to the majority leader of the
Senate, George Mitchell of Maine.
   Wright returned the gesture; Mitchell sat passively. Later the
leaders met with Bush and watched as he signed papers formally
nominating his Cabinet.
   Former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, who had many
memorable battles with Reagan, declared ``We're back to normalcy in
the White House. How delighted I am.''
   In Boston, a subdued Michael Dukakis watched on television,
eating a tuna sandwich. The vanquished Democratic presidential
nominee credited Bush with ``a good speech,'' and sent him a
congratulatory telegram for the ``sense of optimism, the call to
duty and the generosity of spirit by which you called on all of us.''
   Bush drew his greatest applause when he spoke of the drug issue,
saying ``we as a society must rise up united and express our
intolerance ... There is much to be done and to be said, but take my
word: This scourge will stop.''
   Bush started with a prayer, one imploring the divinity to ``write
on our hearts these words: `Use power to help people.'''
   ``I come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich
with promise. We live in in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can
make it better,'' he said.
   Afterward, while Bush lunched with members of Congress, the skies
cleared and the temperature climbed into the 50s to present Bush
with a picture-perfect afternoon for his parade, a 3{-hour affair
that stretched past sundown.
   The celebration continued into the night as the Bushes and the
Quayles made the rounds of nearly a dozen inaugural balls throughout
the capital.
   Bush, who is not keen on dancing, made it through the first
couple of events without taking to the dance floor.
   ``This is the first formal event... and perhaps the most humane:
a ball at which you do not have to dance,'' the president said at
his first stop of the evening.
   Quayle, too, showed little interest in dancing but said ``I guess
protocol allows you to witness my inability to dance'' as he and
Mrs. Quayle took their turn around the floor.

   Bush's brief parade forays from the security of the new
presidential limousine, once at the foot of Capitol Hill and again
upon his arrival at the White House, recalled a similar gesture by
Jimmy Carter in 1976, when the Democrat walked most of the route.
For Bush, it seemed to symbolize his inaugural promise to usher in
an ``age of the offered hand.''
   At the White House, the Bushes took their seats in an enclosed
reviewing stand to watch more than 200 marching units, including
those from schools and colleges in every state, pay their salute.
His adopted Texas produced an especially large contingent, and son
George Bush Jr. donned a white 10-gallon hat as the University of
Texas Longhorn Band strutted by.
   The parade, with famed test pilot Chuck Yeager and comedian Bob
Hope as grand marshals, featured 12,000 marchers, 457 horses, and 70
floats, including one with a Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bomber, a
duplicate of the plane Bush flew in World War II. Bush waved in
delight as it passed by. He and Mrs. Bush stood and sang along for
the finale, a rendition of ``Battle Hymn of the Republic'' by the
Morman Tabernacle Choir.
   On Saturday they planned to personally open the White House doors
for a public reception.
   In his first official acts as president, Bush signed a
proclamation making Sunday a National Day of Prayer and
Thanksgiving, and formally presented Congress with his nominations
for his seniormost aides.
   The ceremony took place in the ornate President's Room, where
Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation and former President
Lyndon Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   The inaugural platform was framed against a backdrop of red,
white and blue, featuring American flags from 1789, 1889 and 1989.
The archway that Bush walked through was draped in red bunting like
that hung on Federal Hall in New York City when George Washington
was inaugurated two centuries ago.
   Bush took his oath, administred by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, three minutes behind schedule. He removed his topcoat and
donned his glasses to read his speech, turning the pages of his text
as he went despite having a TelePrompter.
   After bidding farewell to Reagan, the Bushes and Quayles joined
the two justices and congressional leaders for a traditional
luncheon in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, before leading a massive
parade down Pennsylvania to the White House, one featuring marching
units and other performers from every state. More than 10,000 people
participated, and hundreds of thousands lined the parade route.
   At Andrews, Reagan reviewed a platoon from each of the five
military branches, then received a 21-gun salute as an Army band
played the national anthem. The Reagan waved to a flag-waving crowd
of about 2,000 people before boarding the Boeing 707 jetliner which
would no longer be designated Air Force One with him aboard. One
person waved a sign: ``So long, Gipper.''
   Earlier, Reagan was asked as he was walking through the Rotunda
of the Capitol if he felt a sense of relief. He replied: ``No, but a
great pride in what's happening.''
   Bush, meanwhile, was asked how he intended to carry out the goals
cited in his inaugural address without a tax increase.
   ``You never measure kindness and gentleness in how much you take
out of the pockets of the people,'' Bush said.
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said Bush's appeal for
bipartisanship was ``very well received'' by Democrats.
   In the final hours of his presidency, Reagan paid a farewell
visit to the Oval Office, shook hands with aides and left a
handwritten note on the desk wishing Bush well. The last piece of
paper Reagan signed was a letter to British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, thanking her for staunch support over the years, said
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Serving as White House hosts one last time, the Reagans treated
the Bushes and the Quayles to coffee and pastries in the Blue Room
of the executive mansion. Then they went to the Capitol together.
   Thousands of people surged into the city to view the festivities
and get an spot along the 1.6-mile inaugural parade route. Although
federal employees were given the day off, there was a heavy crush of
passengers on the subway system, catching ciy officials by surprise.
   In advance, Bush said that in the first days of his
administration, he would order a sweeping review of U.S. relations
with the Soviet Union while making the federal budget deficit his
top priority at home. He will meet Tuesday with leaders from
Congress.
   In a handwritten note, Bush scripted his day: Up at 6 a.m. to
watch news shows and drink coffee, ``play with grandkids, pray, go
to White House, go to Capitol Hill, get sworn in.''

<HEAD>Surgeon Could Face Criminal Charges For Lobotomizing Drug Addicts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A neurosurgeon told a medical board on
Friday that he drilled holes in the skulls of two young women and
injected saltwater into their brains to cure their drug addiction.
   The Athens Medical Society ordered Dr. Dimitris Vougiouklakis to
appear before a disciplinary board and recommended that his license
be revoked. Vougiouklakis also could face criminal charges.
   The 69-year-old physician told the medical society during a
hearing Friday that he performed the ``chemical lobotomies'' to cure
the women of heroin addiction.
   Vougiouklakis, 69, has been quoted in newspaper inteviews as
saying that ``because we had exhausted other forms of therapy it was
my thought to perform lobotomies on them.''
   A lobotomy is a surgical operation in which incisions are made in
a lobe of the brain. It has been used to treat some cases of
psychoses, such as schizophrenia.
   The present condition of the two unidentified women, ages 23 and
26, was not disclosed.
   The medical society said after the hearing Friday that
``scientific and ethical procedures were ignored and the operation
itself does not constitute therapy.'' It asked its disciplinary
council to revoke the doctor's license.
   Greek medical ethics call for doctors to explain procedures and
risks to the patients before giving therapy.
   If Vougiouklakis' license to practice is revoked, the public
prosecutor will automatically step in to press charges of
malpractice, under Greek law.
   Matina Letsa, a spokeswoman for the Health Ministry, said ``a
medical investigator has been assigned to look into the matter.''
   The bizarre case shocked the Athens medical community and made
the front pages of the national press after it was reported in the
afternoon daily Ta Nea last week.
   ``I've never heard of a `chemical' lobotomy. I know surgical
lobotomies were performed in extreme cases of mental illness in the
1950s, but the method was abondoned because it was destructive to
the personality of the patients,'' said Fotis Bobos, a psychiatrist
at the Center for Mental Health.
   ``I have certainly never heard of a lobotomy on drug addicts,''
he added.
   A leading Athens psychiatrist who requested anonymity said the
operation was ``much ado about nothing.''
   ``The saline solution will just dissolve and there will be no
result whatsoever. But tampering with someone's brain can be
destructive,'' the psychiatrist said.

   Traders at the nation's biggest futures exchanges
are putting their seats up for sale, panicked by an investigation in
which FBI agents reportedly posed as traders and bought a seat on an
exchange.
   Five more seats were sold by the close of business Friday, for a
total of 14 seats sold at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the
Chicago Board of Trade since Thursday, when news broke on the probe
into allegations that traders defrauded investors of millions of
dollars.
   ``We had a week's worth of sales in a day,'' said Andrew Yemma,
chief spokesman for the Merc.
   Traders at the two exchanges are the targets of an investigation
that involved the tape-recording of hundreds of transactions on
trading floors over a two-year period. Subpoenas have been issued
for records at both the Merc and CBOT.
   The Chicago Tribune reported Friday that the FBI secretly paid
for a Board of Trade seat _ which can cost hundreds of thousands of
dollars _ and had agent Richard Carlson act as a soybean futures
trader. He was one of four agents who picked up evidence of
widespread fraud.
   Commodities attorney John Troelstrup attributed the sales of
seats to ``fear of the unknown'' among traders.
   ``It's the sudden realization they have been in the midst of
people who are not of them, wearing wires,'' said Troelstrup. But he
said most would not be greatly affected by the investigation.
   ``There are people who will be more careful,'' he said, ``but the
overwhelming majority of the traders on the floor will do nothing
differently because they didn't do anything wrong.''
   FBI spokeswoman Jane Koshutko would neither confirm nor deny the
investigation Friday. But a law enforcement official in Washington,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed it a day earlier.
   Seats on the exchanges allow traders access to various markets on
the trading floor. The Merc has 2,724 seats, the Board of Trade
3,400.
   Last year the price of a Merc seat ranged from $350,000 to
$523,500, officials said. Prices for Board of Trade seats ranged
from $371,000 to $545,000, said Mark Prout, an exchange spokesman.
   The Tribune, citing sources it did not identify, said Carlson and
another agent, Michael McLoughlin, who traded Treasury bonds,
attempted to win the confidence of other traders by entertaining
them at posh downtown apartments and exercising with them at an
expensive health club.
   The agents-turned-traders recorded conversations on the trading
floors that suggest some trades were rigged to prevent customers
from getting fair-market prices, and that some brokers sent false
reports to customers to hide the skimming of profits or overcharges
on commissions, the Tribune said.
   Unlike stock brokers on Wall Street, commodity traders trade for
themselves as well as their customers in a chaotic auction system
that employs shouting and hand signals, making it easy for a trader
to get lost in the crowd.
   They buy and sell contracts for future delivery of commodities
such as grains, livestock, Treasury bonds and foreign currencies.
   Carlson and McLoughlin first showed up at the Board of Trade in
1983 as trainees at ADM Investors Inc., a commodity-training arm of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., traders told the Tribune.
   Richard Burket, an ADM vice president in Decatur, Ill., confirmed
that the two worked at ADM Investors, but he declined to comment
further.
   FBI agents, accompanied by Carlson and McLoughlin, visited
suprised traders and commodities executives at their homes Tuesday
to deliver the first grand jury subpoenas resulting from the
investigation, sources told the Tribune.
   ``This is a dramatic thing, but it may not be traumatic in the
big picture,'' Troelstrup said Friday. ``Most traders are just going
to go about their business.
   ``The traders' trust of other traders will proceed in the classic
manner. They'll go based on their guts and instinct.''

   Militant Tamils ambushed a Sri Lankan
army convoy in the northwest province Friday, killing seven people,
police officials said.
   They said an army officer, five soldiers and a Tamil civilian
died, raising to 15 the number of those killed in fighting involving
Tamil rebels over a 24-hour period.
   Under briefing rules, police officials holding such briefings
cannot be identified.
   At least six Indian peacekeeping soldiers and two Tamil
extremists were killed in two attacks in the northern Jaffna
peninsula late Thursday, the officials said. The Indian Embassy
confirmed the killings.
   Police blamed the attacks on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, who have demanded a boycott of Feb. 15 national elections.
   Indian soldiers came to supervise an arms surrender by the Tamils
but became involved in military operations when the Tigers backed
away from the accord.
   The Tamil insurgency started in 1983. Militants demand an
independent homeland in the north and east, claiming discrimination
by the majority Sinhalese.

   Dan Quayle took office as the nation's 44th
vice president on Friday, completing his move from campaign
lightning rod to understudy for the presidency.
   At 41, Quayle assumed the second highest office in the land _ one
which has been largely ceremonial in nature over history and for
which the new president has spelled out no real duties.
   Quayle preceded President Bush in taking the oath of office by
six minutes, at 11:57 a.m. EST, and wore his topcoat against the
chilly breeze.
   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor administered the oath,
but she failed to include six well-known words. After the pledge to
defend the Constitution, she omitted the phrase ``against all
enemies, foreign and domestic.''
   Quayle smiled broadly but said nothing beyond the words of the
simple oath of office. O'Connor concluded with, ``Congratulations.''
   Later, Quayle told reporters, ``I was listening very carefully as
she administered the oath and I was very careful to repeat precisely
as she offered it to me.''
   Asked if he was aware some words were left out, he said, ``I'm
not going to get into that.''
   During the oath, Quayle said, he was thinking that ``you can't
help but think the entire world is focusing upon you.''
   The new vice president was sworn in with his wife Marilyn at his
side and holding a family Bible on which her husband rested his
hand. Their three children _ Tucker, 14, Benjamin, 12, and Corinne,
9 _ looked on from behind them.
   Marilyn Quayle, a lawyer and serious-minded adviser to her
husband during the campaign, wore a brilliant blue oversized
sailor's hat. After the ceremony, the hat blew off her head in the
backwash of former President Reagan's departing helicopter.
   They rode in a limousine through the inaugural parade from the
Capitol to the White House, stepping out of their car to walk
briefly and wave to the crowd. Mrs. Quayle's hat was back on her
head _ a Secret Service agent had retrieved it.
   Mrs. Quayle's dress and hat were the work of fashion students at
the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles.
They also designed the hat and dress worn by Corinne, said Quayle
press secretary David Beckwith.
   Quayle and his wife were making the rounds of all of the evening
inaugural balls.
   Quayle planned to deliver his first speech as vice president
Saturday. Beckwith said it would be a ``personal view'' of the
campaign, his philosophy and thoughts on the future.
   Formerly the little-known junior senator from Indiana, Quayle was
propeled to the nation's second-highest job by his surprise
selection to the ticket by Bush last August in New Orleans at the
Republican National Convention.
   Quayle has described what followed as ``a baptism by fire.'' He
was dogged by questions about his experience, qualifications,
military service and academic record. He became the focus of intense
criticism of Bush, for his judgment in the selection, by Bush's
Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis.
   Receiving the warm greetings of supporters at a reception the day
before taking office, Quayle recalled the harshness of the campaign
criticism by quoting Winston Churchill.
   ``Winston Churchill once said that there's nothing more
exhilarating than to be shot at without result,'' Quayle said.
   In the traditional oath, Quayle promised to ``support and defend
the Constitution of the United States'' and to ``bear true faith and
allegiance to the same.''
   Before the Capitol ceremony, Quayle and his wife were invited to
the White House by outgoing President Reagan for morning coffee with
Bush and his wife, Barbara.
   They attended morning services with Bush and Mrs. Bush at St.
John's Church near the White House.
   Quayle and his family arrived on the terrace outside the Capitol
for the inaugural ceremony four minutes after the Reagans arrived.
Quayle chatted with the departing president for several minutes as
they awaited Bush.
   As Quayle stood preparing for the oath, Bush turned to the Quayle
children, smiled and asked, ``Are we ready?''
   Quayle kept his coat on through the president's address, as the
wind and dropping temperatures in the shaded terrace made conditions
cooler than the mild weather forecast. Portable space heaters were
placed around the rostrum. Quayle took off the coat to join the
Bushes in waving to the crowd.
   Later in the evening, Quayle and his wife made the rounds of
inaugural balls. She wore a long purple gown with a fitted,
embroidered top and a purple bow in her hair.
   Before setting out for the evening, Quayle told reporters, ``my
wife tells me I'm a terrible dancer and I'm going to try to keep it
to a minimum.''
   At each of the balls, he spoke briefly to the crowds, danced with
his wife, and then he and Marilyn danced with guests selected form
the audience.
   ``I guess protocol allows that you witness my inability to dance
_ but i'm going to be much better after the night is over,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lebanese Leaders Invited To Arab League Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Arab League on Friday invited the
leaders of Lebanon's rival Christian and Moslem governments to a
reconciliation meeting in Tunisia aimed at averting the formal
partition of this war-divided nation.
   An official spokesman said the invitations were delivered by two
special envoys of Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign
minister who heads a League committee set up last week to help
settle Lebanon's political crisis.
   The envoys, Abdel Mohsen al-Gaian and Ahmed Ben al-Jassem, met
separately with Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, and Gen. Michel Aoun, a
Maronite Christian, prime ministers of the rival Cabinets, and with
Hussein Husseini, the Shiite Moslem Parliament speaker, said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   All have said they are ready to cooperate with the committee. The
two Moslems said they will fly to Tunis, the Tunisian capital, to
meet the committee this month.
   No date has been set for a reconciliation gathering.
   Lebanon has been without a head of state since Sept. 22, when
President Amin Gemayel's 6-year term expired.
   Lebanon has been divided into Moslem and Christian enclaves since
civil war broke out in 1975. Feuding also goes on among the various
militias.
   Two Shiite militias _ Syrian-backed Amal and pro-Iranian
Hezbollah _ fought each other with rocket-propelled grenades and
machine guns Thursday night in south Beirut's slums, with three
people reported wounded.
   The casualties raised the toll to 168 killed and 318 wounded
since Dec. 31, when the two militias began fighting in Beirut and
southern Lebanon.

   ``Following this important meeting senior British police officers

   This was an exciting fashion week in Rome, not so
much for the beautiful clothes seen on the runway, as for the verbal
fireworks set off by Valentino's last-minute decision to take his
new spring-summer high fashion collection to Paris.
   Calling his Rome show _ traditionally the high point of the twice
a year Italian high fashion week _ a ``preview,'' the king of
Italian couture announced that for the first time he would present
his collection during the Parisian shows which open next week.
   The blow of Italy's favorite fashion son abandoning the home
runway would have been bad enough, but during a news conference,
Valentino's business partner Giancarlo Giametti defended the
decision by saying that Valentino could no longer afford to show for
``down and out women, and second-rate actresses.''
   He mentioned no names and Rome's ``in crowd'' were faithfully in
their front row seats when the curtain rose on the new collection at
Rome's fashionable Grand Hotel Thursday night.
   Rumor has it, however, that in the interim Valentino made a
hurried round of flattering phone calls to those clients who could
have taken Giametti's remarks personally.
   Valentino, who already shows his ready-to-wear collection in
Paris, has repeatedly said he has no intention of abandoning Rome,
but is just adding Paris to his high-fashion runway. As proof he
cites the massive restoration work going on in his downtown Rome
palazzo, which will include enlarged offices and a brand new theater.
   However, Italian fashion watchers see the Paris show as a severe
blow to the made-in-Italy label. Except for a golden period in the
1960s, Italian High Fashion has been the poor sister of Paris
couture. Valentino was the ace up its sleeve, and the mainstay of
the Rome fashion week.
   Aside from Valentino, the Roman fashion favorite remains Roberto
Capucci, who on Friday closed the Rome fashion week, during which
Italy's top 15 high fashion designers showed their new wears.
   In general the look for the spring-summer 1989 presented in Rome
this week was romantic and feminine. Daytime and cocktail hour
hemlines remained an inch or two above the knee, unlike the
ready-to-wear lengths for this year's warmer season which fell
dramatically below the knee after the latest mini skirt craze.
   Shoulders are demure and for the most part unpadded. Waistlines
tend to be marked. Although trousers are not rampant, they do appear
in almost every collection.
   Colors are either contrasts of black and white or navy and white,
beiges and grays, or bright shades of blue, green yellow red and
tangerine.
   With less shimmery and sequined fabrics as in past seasons,
jewelry tends to be opulent, with gold dripping from the neck or
draped around both wrists. In the shoe department there are lots of
sling backs with heels going higher as the day goes on.
   Lacey fabrics are the big item for day and night.
   What Paris will see next week and Rome saw Thursday is a
Valentino who wants his woman so dainty and prim that she risks
resembling a nanny or a tea room waitress. Stiff and proper white
collars pop out of impeccable navy blue suits with or without brass
buttons. For the cocktail hour these suits come in black and white
with bib or apron like lace accessories.
   At night Valentino abandons the boredom of perfection, and comes
back to his sensuous Roman senses with wonderful velvet jackets
embroidered in sequined elephants (manufactured in India) and ball
gowns made of flounces of ruffled taffeta and satin bows.
   Gianfranco Ferre, a top name in Milan ready-to-wear but a
relative newcomer to high fashion, literally weaves his gowns out of
raffia and wicker interspersed with silk spring flowers. He also
takes the mantilla off the head and wraps it delicately over the
shouldlers. The unique and easily identifiable effect is sure to
make Ferre a big name at international garden parties this summer.
   Capucci never does what everyone else is doing, but his own thing
always excels. His clothes look as good on the rack as they do on
the model, meaning they are first works of art and then items of
attire. Not for nothing do Capucci creations show up in fashion
museums throughout the world.
   The look Capucci proposes is a more modern slimmed-down version
of his opulent corrugated silk gowns, with the ever-present huge
panels and generous bustles. He favors bright carnival shades, as
well as life-sized silk flowers to dot gowns and jackets. His latest
invention is the cape coat or dress where the side seams are
stitched together.

   Two of 25 human rights activists arrested
by Bulgarian authorities were still being held Friday, and several
others were on hunger strike to protest police harassment, emigre
sources said.
   The two under arrest and facing prosecution were identified as
Lubomir Sobachiev and Sabri Andiev from Russe, a city close to the
Romanian border.
   The 25 members of the Society for the Protection of Human Rights
were arrested before the visit to Sofia this week of French
President Francois Mitterrand.
   French diplomats learned of the arrests and most of the activists
were subsequently released from police custody but placed under
house arrest.
   There were conflicting reports about how many rights activists
remained under house arrest. They included Petar Manolov, Grigor
Simov Bozhilov and Dimitar Tomor, said the International Helsinki
Federation in Vienna.
   Nine of those released went on a hunger strike this week to
protest police action, the federation reported. But Eduard Genov, an
emigre member of the Society, told The Associated Press he had
learned that at least 15 were on hunger strike and others had
planned to join them.
   Genov, who was reached in Los Angeles by telephone, said Grigor
Simov, Blagoi Topuzliev and Ilie Minev, the chairman of the Society
for the Protection of Human Rights, also were under house arrest in
different Bulgarian towns.
   Manolov has been informed he will be charged with ``consciously
spreading spreading false allegations against the government'', for
which they could face imprisonment of up to three years, according
to the Helsinki Federation.
   The Society for the Protection of Human Rights in Bulgaria was
founded in January 1988. Membership ranges between 100 and 200,
according to several reports.

<HEAD>Tibetan Rioter Given Suspended Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tibetan accused of killing a policeman during
anti-Chinese riots in March was given a death sentence that could be
commuted to life imprisonment, an official news report said Thursday.
   The Xinhua News Agency said 23 other participants in the March 5
uprising were given prison terms. One was sentenced to life
imprisonment.
   Losang Danzim, identified after his arrest last year as a Tibet
University student, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.
   The suspended death sentence, common in Chinese criminal cases,
is commuted to life imprisonment if the prisoner demonstrates a good
attitude during a two-year period.
   Danzim was charged with the murder of policeman Yuan Shisheng,
22, who was stabbed and thrown out of a second-floor window during
the riots. Another policeman was seriously injured in the attack.
   Soinam Wangdui, another of four suspects arrested in the attack,
was sentenced to life imprisonment, Xinhua said.
   It said four other rioters were sentenced to a maximum of 15
years in prison at the public trial. Thirteen received a maximum 14
years and five were sentenced to up to three years in prison.
   Three others were convicted of small crimes but did not receive
prison terms.
   Yuan's death was one of five reported by the government in the
protest. Western travelers in Tibet, however, quoted local residents
as saying 24 were killed.
   The March disturbances followed pro-independence unrest in
September and October 1987 in which at least 14 died by unofficial
count.
   Violence broke out again Dec. 10 when police opened fire on a
pro-independence demonstration, killing at least one Buddhist monk
and one child.
   The protests have been led by Buddhlst monks loyal to their
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who fled into exile after a failed
uprising in 1959.
   China, which says Tibet has been an integral part of its
territory for seven centuries, has sought to reduce tensions in the
area by showing greater tolerance for Tibetan religious and cultural
practices and elevating some Tibetans to positions of local
authority.

   Only 40 Nicaraguans remained in a temporary shelter
at Miami's Bobby Maduro baseball stadium late Thursday night, after
a federal judge refused to block immigration officials from denying
them work permits.
   City trucks ferried the refugees to other shelters and private
apartments where a month's free rent had already been paid with
donations raised by Miami's Spanish-language radio stations.
   Officials said the last of about 250 refugees would have to leave
the stadium by Friday morning to prepare the stadium for the arrival
of the Baltimore Orioles spring training camp on Monday.
   A federal judge refused to stop the Immigration and
Naturalization Service from denying work permits to some Nicaraguan
refugees, but agreed to hear arguments in the case.
   Three Nicaraguans denied applications for work permits sought a
temporary restraining order against the INS. Their attorney, Robert
L. Boyer wanted the case certified as a class action to affect all
Nicaraguans in similar circumstances.
   U.S. District Judge James W. Kehoe told lawyers for both sides to
file briefs, and said he would hold a full hearing to resolve the
issue ``as soon as possible.''
   Boyer's complaint said the Nicaraguans had been ``subjected to an
arbitrary and inconsistent treatment of requests for employment
authorizations,'' which he called ``a clear abuse of administrative
discretion.''
   He also claimed that recent changes in INS procedure ``are
drastic changes from the practice in effect in this district since
July 1987, when then-Attorney General Edwin Meese published a
memorandum encouraging Nicaraguan nationals to apply for asylum.''

   Cuba has withdrawn all 3,000 troops it had
pledged to pull out of Angola by April, the Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina said Thursday.
   The government agency said completion of the first phase of the
withdrawal agreed upon in a December peace plan was announced in a
note from the Armed Forces Ministry published on the front page of
the newspaper Granma.
   More than 1,000 combatants returned home on seven flights this
month and two rented Soviet passenger ships, carrying 1,000 troops
each, left Luanda, one on Jan. 10 and another on Jan. 15, the agency
said.
   The note called the early return of the troops a goodwill gesture
under the agreement.
   Under a peace plan signed Dec. 22 with Angola and South Africa,
Cuba agreed to gradually withdraw all its 50,000 troops from Angola
by mid-1991 and Namibia will become independent after a
U.N.-sponsored election.

   Two ultralight aircraft collided during a night
flight 500 feet above the Florida Panhandle, killing one pilot while
the other escaped with facial cuts, authorities said Thursday.
   Brian Lewis, 29, of Holt was dead at the scene of the crash
Wednesday night about a mile southwest of this Panhandle community.
Dennis Allen Young, 35, also of Holt, was treated for facial cuts
and discharged from a hospital.
   ``They met every weekend to fly, but when they arrived at the
site late Wednesday they decided to go ahead and fly at night since
there was a full moon,'' said Bill Welch, an Okaloosa County
sheriff's spokesman.
   Young told investigators the two had never flown at night before
but both aircraft were equipped with strobe lights to help them
navigate and avoid each other.
   Young said he tried to avoid a collision, but Lewis' craft struck
the bottom of Young's ultralight and went into a nosedive.
   Young ``was apparently able to glide down after the collision,
but the other fellow fell from a great distance,'' said Nick Stager,
director of Okaloosa County Emergency Medical Services.
   Ultralights are small, lightweight single-engine aircraft
resembling hang-gliders more than traditional fixed-wing planes and
often are built from kits. The National Transporation and Safety
Board said it will not investigate because ultralight aircraft below
a certain weight are not subject to federal aviation regulations.

   An Indian activist who staged a takeover
of a newspaper office last year became a fugitive from the law
Thursday as a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to
appear for an arraignment.
   The activist, Eddie Hatcher, is staying at the Fort Hill Indian
Reservation in Idaho.
   ``I am not going back to Robeson County,'' Hatcher said earlier
this week. ``I have appeared before a tribal judge here and they
will have to go through the tribal court to get me back.''
   Hatcher's $25,000 bond would be revoked because he did not appear
in court Tuesday, said Linda Small, assistant clerk of Robeson
County Superior Court. The bond was posted by the National Council
of Churches.
   Hatcher is charged with 14 counts of second-degree kidnapping in
the 10-hour takeover of The Robesonian newspaper last February.
   He and Timothy Jacobs, both Tuscarora Indians from Pembroke, held
up to 20 people hostage while Hatcher demanded an investigation into
alleged corruption and drug trafficking in local government.
   The incident ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to establish a
task force to investigate the allegations. The panel found no
evidence to substantiate the charges.
   Hatcher and Jacobs were acquitted of federal hostage-taking and
firearms charges in October, but they were indicted on state charges
in December.
   Jacobs left Robeson County shortly after the indictments were
issued. He fled to the Onondaga Indian Reservation in New York, but
was arrested at the reservation and is an extradition battle.

<TEXT>
   Pro-government newspapers suggested
that the political opposition staged the looting of a Red Cross
warehouse to discredit the austere economic policies of the ruling
Sandinista party.
   The official party newspaper Barricada asked Wednesday if the
looting was the work of ``criminal elements or if it was calculated
with political intentions.''
   The pro-government El Nuevo Diario went a step farther. In a
Wednesday editorial, it suggested the CIA and the opposition
newspaper La Prensa had invented the story. It said they wanted to
discredit the leftist government.
   Managua Red Cross Director Omar Cruz said scores of people who
broke in through the warehouse roof Tuesday took clothing and food
donated for victims of a hurricane that lashed the Atlantic coast in
October.
   Cruz told The Associated Press, which photographed the incident,
that he did not know what the stolen items were worth.
   La Prensa said the intruders were Nicaraguans made desperate by
the severe economic crisis.
   ``We're hungry, we have no clothing. The Sandinistas are at fault
for all of this,'' it quoted a looter as saying Tuesday.
   Nicaragua suffered more than 20,000 percent inflation last year.
The government has devalued the currency several times and raised
fuel and tranport prices in attempt to right the battered economy.
   The leftist government says Hurricane Joan worsened an economic
crisis brought on by eight years of civil war with the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels.
   Hurricane Joan slammed into the country on Oct. 21, 1988, killing
about 100 people and leaving estimated 200,000 homeless. Property
damage was estimated at more than $700 million.

   George Bush and Dan Quayle sang the ``Star
Spangled Banner'' and clapped along with country singers at a
two-hour inaugural gala Thursday night, ending with the
president-elect promising ``with heart and soul to represent all the
people.''
   Some of the biggest names in show business performed before an
overflow black-tie crowd of 12,000 Republican faithful and tossed
their own bouquets at Bush and his vice president-to-be.
   Bob Hope said Bush will move into the White House on Friday with
the American people's prayers that ``it will be nothing but splendid
for you.'' Muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger, dubbing himself ``Conan
the Republican,'' said it was a ``time for new beginnings.''
   The president-elect bounced a grandchild on his knee, clapped and
waved to the crowd during the show, which was broadcast live by the
CBS. Quayle, sitting in a separate box, watched with his 10-year-old
daughter, Corinne, sitting on his knee.
   The prime-time extravaganza at the Washington Convention Center
featured celebrities from Broadway, classical music and Bush's
favorite country and Western foot stompers.
   The show capped a long day of parties, receptions and dinner
dances around the capital, including a vice presidential reception
for Quayle at the National Museum of American History and a salute
to Barbara Bush at the Kennedy Center.
   As the show closed, Bush took the stage and said the crowd and
the television audience, ``I expect that every one of the other 40
presidents pledged in his mind and soul to represent all the people.
Well, this 41st president-to-be feels exactly the same way.''
   ``I'll work my hardest, I will do my best and with the help of
the American people, I believe we can get the job done,'' he said.
   Earlier, former television newscaster Walter Cronkite opened the
evening. ``Let the celebration begin,'' he said, and then turned the
stage over to Nell Carter for a foot-stomping song-and-dance
rendition of Fats Wallers' ``This Joint is Jumpin.'''
   After she took her bows, Ms. Carter yelled to Bush: ``If you ever
need a diplomat, I'm in the book. I'm free anytime.''
   Bush then joined the audience in clapping along with a rousing
song by the Oak Ridge Boys, who, along with Loretta Lynn, were
personally requested by the president-elect to make an appearance.
   Other headliners included Frank Sinatra, ballet dancer Mikhail
Baryshnikov and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
   The gala was expected to gross $9 million in ticket sales and
revenues from TV commercials to help defray the estimated $25
million in costs for four days of privately financed inaugural
festivities.
   Guests at the gala were paying as much as $250 per seat,
depending on location, and $25,000 for an eight-seat ``box'' close
to the stage crowned by a canopy emblazoned with gold stars. The box
seats were the highest-priced inaugural tickets in town.
   In addition, 14 minutes of TV ads were sold for $4.9 million.
Many of the big-name stars were performing free, and the gala was
expected to yield a $6 million profit after expenses.
   A special box facing the stage was reserved for Bush and his
guests while a smaller one to the left of the stage was reserved for
Quayle and his party.
   But the vice president-elect was the featured attraction at the
reception in his honor at the Smithsonian museum and at an
$85-per-ticket party for 1,500 guests sponsored by the Indiana State
Society.

   Protestors angry that ancient human remains were
dug up to make way for a luxury hotel have halted a Maui island
resort's construction and given new life to the fight between
developers hoping to lure more tourists here and Hawaiian activists
trying to preserve the islands' culture.
   ``Although this land was once ruled by Hawaiians, they are no
longer part of the power elite. I don't think this could happen to
the gravesite of a more powerful group,'' said Hawaiian activist
Edward Kanahele, a spokesman for the group ``Malama Na Kapuna,'' or
Caring for Our Ancestors. ``It's been painful for us to see so many
other burial sites paved over or dug up, but we were never organized
enough before. Now we are.''
   It was hundreds of protestors like Kanahele, with the sympathy of
part-Hawaiian Gov. John Waihee, who forced a temporary halt Dec. 23
to the excavation of the second-largest known Hawaiian burial site
in this island chain.
   By then, more than 900 skeletons had been exhumed, most believed
to have been buried more than 1,000 years ago.
   But the state cannot force Kapalua Land Company, Inc. to give up
its plan to build the nearly $100 million, 450-room Ritz Carlton
hotel on Maui's northwest shore.
   Kapalua has the county-issued construction permits it needs, and
halted the excavation only as long as it takes to work out a
compromise.
   Kanahele said it was up to Hawaii residents concerned with its
history and culture to stop the ``desecration of burial sites and
removal of our culture.''
   As recently as 20 years ago, when bones were regularly found at
construction sites, they were often burned, thrown away or just left
at the site. That treatment was considered desecration; according to
ancient Hawaiian tradition, a person's ``mana,'' or spirit, lived on
with his remains.
   ``We mainly have to look at the morality and religious aspects of
this issue,'' Kanahele said. ``Those bones have been buried there
for thousands of years, they are our history and our culture. We
should not be swayed by the brief economic interlude provided by a
hotel that surely won't last as long as those remains.''
   Kapalua Land is a subsidiary of Maui Land and Pineapple Co., and
the latter's chairman, Colin Cameron, said the presence of the
burial ground was known before the site was chosen. He said he
worked closely with Maui County and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs,
a state agency that represents native Hawaiian interests, before the
construction permits were granted.
   ``OHA knew all along that it was a large and possibly very
significant site and they agreed to the excavation,'' said Paul
Rosendahl, an archelogist hired to excavate the grounds. He reported
weekly to OHA and a Maui Hawaiian group after the dig began.
   But Linda Delaney, the OHA's land and natural resources officer,
said the site's significance has only recently become clear. ``The
history of the site wasn't well documented and people just didn't
realize how many people were buried there,'' she said. ``Now that we
know, we're trying to stop it.''
   Earlier this month, OHA passed a resolution calling for a
permanent halt to the excavation, reburial of the remains,
consultation with local Hawaiian activist groups and the designation
of the 2.3-acre burial site as ``culturally sensitive'' and
off-limits to development.
   When asked where that leaves the development company, which has
already poured $3 million into the project, Delaney said, ``I don't
know what happens to the hotel. Those are the kinds of questions
that need to be worked out. ... We have to appeal to the community
conscience, the developer's conscience.''
   Kapalua Land agreed to rebury the bones about a mile from the
hotel site. With the excavation 85 percent complete, it's too late
to preserve the original burial site, Cameron said.
   He said he was surprised by opposition to the dig. Excavation
began in August of 1987, and there were no protests at the site
until late last month.
   Meanwhile, the remains are being stored at the Kapalua site, said
Rosendahl, who would like to analyze the skeletons. ``It's such a
complete population,'' he said. ``We could learn so much about the
ancient Hawaiian culture from this dig.''
   Kanahele, though, said the activists don't want the bones dusted
off.
   ``Their afterlife has already been affected,'' he said. ``They've
gone through enough.''

<HEAD>Stroke Prompts South Africans To Consider Future Without Botha</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since 1978,
South Africans have reason to wonder how their country's many
challenges might be tackled without the dominating presence of P.W.
Botha at the helm of the government.
   Although the stroke suffered by the president Wednesday has been
described as mild, there is widespread speculation that he will be
sidelined for several weeks and may have to retire. On Thursday,
Botha appointed Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis to
serve indefinitely as acting president.
   Botha has amassed vast powers in recent years, and his illness
raises the possibility that important political developments in the
coming months will have to be handled by subordinates accustomed to
deferring to the president.
   ``President Botha has come to assume in our public life such a
gigantic stature that his illness casts great uncertainty over the
nation,'' said Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, in an
editorial Thursday. ``Issues of profound importance await his
attention.''
   For example, Namibia _ ruled by South Africa since 1915 _ is due
to begin a seven-month transition to independence on April 1. Botha
has overseen the negotiations which produced this agreement and is
believed to have helped resolve differences within his Cabinet.
   The status of Nelson Mandela remains in limbo. The African
National Congress leader has been transferred from a jail cell to a
spacious house on a prison farm, but Botha appears to be seeking
some conciliatory statement from Mandela before freeing him. It is
possible, though by no means certain, that a new president might
find it easier to approve Mandela's unconditional release.
   On Feb. 3, at the opening of Parliament, Botha was expected to
announce an early general election, to be held in late April.
Political analysts said the stroke would prompt Botha's National
Party to postpone an election until Botha recovers fully or until a
replacement can establish himself.
   ``It would be extremely difficult for the country to go to the
elections with a sick state president in charge, and it would be
difficult for a new incumbent to go to the polls until he is bedded
down in his new office,'' said Colin Eglin, chairman of the liberal
Progressive Federal Party.
   Under South Africa's Constitution, the majority party in the
white chamber of Parliament has total control over the election of a
president. The National Party is widely favored to retain its solid
majority whenever the next elections are held, and thus Botha's
eventual successor is almost certain to come from a group of senior
Cabinet members dedicated to the party's current policies.
   In simplest terms, those policies call for gradual reforms that
will ease but not eliminate segregation, and that will extend some
political power to blacks while leaving the white minority in
control.
   The Star newspaper of Johannesburg, the country's largest daily,
on Thursday quoted National Party officials as saying National
Education Minister F.W. de Klerk is the leading contender to succeed
Botha. His political views are considered close to Botha's, and he
is party leader in Transvaal _ the most populous province.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who is no relation to the president,
also is a contender. He is more flamboyant and slightly more liberal
than most of his Cabinet colleagues, but his support from the public
is believed to be stronger than within the National Party caucus,
which will choose the new president.
   The most hawkish contender is Defense Minister Magnus Malan. He
is viewed as capable of halting defections to the far right but
unlikely to achieve breakthroughs in relations with the
disenfranchised black majority.
   Heunis, a long-time Botha ally, is not viewed as a leading
contender to become the next full-fledged president.
   Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a relatively moderate black leader whom
Botha has tried unsuccessfully to draw into negotiations, said
Thursday the president ``has served South Africa as he best knew
how, and nobody should begrudge him the rest which should follow the
stroke.''
   Botha ``has done more than all his predecessors to turn South
Africa in the right direction,'' said Buthelezi. But the Zulu leader
indicated he would be glad to see Botha's ``transitional'' era end
because reform ``has ground to a halt.''

   A few days after Beijing's first exhibition of
nude paintings opened in December, art students put up posters
critizing it. Then nude models went on strike.
   Now two models have sued the institute that sponsored the show
and some artists around Beijing are turning up their noses at the
commercialism of the biggest nude exhibition in Communist China's
40-year history.
   Nevertheless, Ge Pengren, a motorcycle-riding artist who
organized the show, remains undaunted.
   ``We're making money,'' said Ge, an assistant professor at the
Central Academy of Fine Arts, ``and that, for artists in China, is a
rare thing. I don't care about the rest.''
   The show, he added, is giving new hope to the financially
strapped art world in China and will serve as a model for
exhibitions to come.
   The 128 paintings of the Exhibition of Figure Oil Painting took
up the second floor of the cavernous China Art Gallery from Dec. 22
to Jan. 8. More than 200,000 people lined up for hours in the cold
to pay about 10 times the normal entrance fee of 0.20 yuan (5 cents).
   Inside, they saw realist nudes, abstract nudes, expressionist
nudes and impressionist nudes.
   ``For us, this was not just an exhibition of nudes,'' Ge said in
an interview in his cramped studio in central Beijing. ``It was a
movement, a nude cultural movement, a sexual culture movement.''
   In a commercial twist, the show also spawned a series of spin-off
items _ a coffee-table book on the exhibition, postcards, color
slides, a paperback.
   Sales have been brisk. During the exhibition's 18 days, viewers
bought all of the show's 15,000 books, Ge said. More are being
printed.
   The exhibition differed from previous ones in China in that, once
it was approved by the Ministry of Culture a year ago, government
bureaucrats didn't interfere. Artists organized the show, picked the
paintings and put up capital.
   ``We emptied our pockets to put the show on,'' said Ge. ``All of
us took major financial risks. But it's paying off.''
   Indeed, the show and the spin-off items are making so much money
that Ge won't disclose any figures. After the state and the gallery
take their shares, the artists will keep the rest.
   Government officials appeared pleased with the exhibition. A slew
of editorials in the state-run press have sung its praises.
   Ge says an exhibition in February of young painters and a show in
June of abstract art at the China Art Gallery will follow the nude
show's format.
   As part of China's economic reforms, the government is giving
cultural institutions less money, making them more dependent on
outside sources of income.
   ``We're following that line,'' said Ge. ``The result is we are
freer and possibly richer. If they don't hold purse strings, our
creativity is increased.''
   But, for Ge, the ride has not been a smooth one.
   Two models sued the academy on Jan. 9 claiming they were not told
the paintings would be shown to the public and the exhibition
damaged their reputations. Show organizers earlier had removed five
paintings of the two women.
   Their lawyers are asking for unspecified sums in damages.
   One model said she had been thrown out of her house and her
husband has asked for a divorce because her family saw her picture
at the exhibition.
   ''Society considers me worse than a prostitute because I've done
in the open what those women do in the dark,'' said the other model.
``I can't even go to the public baths because other women point at
me and laugh.''
   The weekend after the show opened, art students at Ge's academy
protested the high cost of tickets.
   ``I think it's dangerous to turn art into a commodity,'' said one
artist at the institute. ``I think that's what this show tried to do
and that is what we were protesting.''
   Said another artist: ``For Chinese, nudes are a mysterious thing
to begin with. But now they're both mysterious and expensive.''

<HEAD>Residents Just Say No To Nancy Reagan Drug Center</HEAD>

   When Nancy Reagan told old pal Merv Griffin of
her post-White House dream to open a drug rehabilitation center
bearing her name, ``every mover and shaker'' for miles around was
called to action.
   Rolls-Royces bearing such luminaries as Texas oilman Marvin
Davis, media magnate Rupert Murdoch and actress Eva Gabor poured
into Griffin's Beverly Hills estate last May for a power breakfast
at his tennis pavilion.
   But the self-described ``little people'' of Lake View Terrace,
fearing the center proposed for the bankrupt Lake View Terrace
Medical Center would invite crime, just said no _ sparking a battle
described as ``David versus Goliath.''
   ``I'm not fighting Nancy Reagan, I'm not fighting Ronald or what
they stand for or what they do. I just don't think this is the place
for it,'' said Suzan Kent, 28, who lives across the street from the
medical center.
   Mrs. Kent and others picketed a welcome-home gala for the Reagans
earlier this month with signs reading, ``If you really care, put it
in Bel-Air,'' referring to the Reagans' new neighborhood.
   Lake View Terrace, about 15 miles north of Bel-Air, is a small
town on the edge of a big city.
   It sits at the foot of the Angeles National Forest, one of the
last semi-rural havens for folks who prefer goats grazing next door
to Ferraris cruising Sunset Boulevard.
   When two planes collided over nearby Pacoima Junior High School
in 1957, an accident depicted in the movie ``La Bamba,'' there was
no place to take the dying. The residents rallied to build the
medical center.
   ``So it holds a very special place in the hearts of the people,''
said Lewis Snow, an officer in the Lake View Terrace sHome Owners
Asociation.
   Snow and others want another hospital, not a drug center. They
fear the center's residents will target nearby homes when they need
extra cash.
   On the other side of the debate is Phoenix House, the nation's
largest private, non-profit drug abuse agency. Founded in 1967, it
operates 10 centers _ six in New York and four in California _ and
is accustomed to opposition.
   ``If we had to back down every time a community said, `Not here,'
we'd never treat the drug problem in this country,'' said spokesman
Christopher Policano.
   When Mrs. Reagan decided to put her imprimatur on a center in the
Los Angeles area, she asked Griffin to help, reportedly saying, ``I
want to come back and go right to work.''
   Griffin responded by inviting what he described as ``every mover
and shaker in this part of the world'' to his May 2 breakfast.
   About $4 million has been raised toward the estimated $10 million
cost, including $1 million at the $25,000-a-table welcome home party
thrown by Barron Hilton and Griffin.
   The 15-acre site would offer treatment for 150 teen-agers who
would live and attend school at the center, plus an additional 60
young adults over 18. There would be out-patient counseling for 15
to 30 youngsters who have just become involved with drugs, and Mrs.
Reagan would have an office at the center.
   The center would not accept anyone with a history of violence nor
anyone on drugs when they were admitted. The agency boasts a 90
percent success rate among the 40,000 or so graduates of its program.
   The Los Angeles Police Department has remained neutral, but area
Capt. Tim McBride is willing to give Phoenix House a chance.
   ``We have a serious drug problem all across the country, and
we've got to do something about that problem. The information I have
about Phoenix House is that they're successful and they're well
run,'' he said.
   The center might open this year, but roadblocks remain.
   Residents plan to pack a hearing before a city zoning officer on
Friday. On Tuesday, the City Council will consider a request for an
environmental impact report. That could mean an eight-month setback
for the center.
   Some residents believe the center will find a home elsewhere.
   ``We definitely have a David-versus-Goliath fight,'' said
resident Jules Bagneris. ``And David did win.''

<TEXT>
   The daughter of 1960s LSD guru Timothy
Leary was ordered Thursday to stand trial for attempted murder in
the shooting of her boyfriend.
   Susan Martino, 41, also known as Susan Leary, was scheduled for
Superior Court arraignment Feb. 3 on an attempted murder charge in
connection with the shooting of Joel Chavira, 38.
   Prosecutors said Ms. Martino shot Chavira in the back of the head
as he slept on a couch in their Glendale apartment, about 10 miles
north of Los Angeles, on Dec. 18.
   Chavira, hospitalized in extremely critical condition, told
police he awoke to a loud explosion and found Ms. Martino in the
kitchen holding a pistol. She was arrested by police Jan. 5 in
Burbank, authorities said.
   Ms. Martino may have thought her boyfriend ``was unfaithful, but
it's hard to tell what the motive is,'' said Deputy District
Attorney John Bernardi.
   Ms. Martino pleaded innocent to a charge of attempted murder Jan.
9 in Glendale Municipal Court. Arraignment was set by Judge Cheryl
Krott for Feb. 3 in Pasadena Superior Court.
   Leary, who during the Sixties advocated use of LSD, a powerful
hallucinogen released a statement through a spokesman saying he was
``distressed about this tragic event'' and ``praying for the young
man's continued recovery.''

   Boxer Lupe Aquino pleaded innocent
Thursday to charges of vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving
stemming from an accident in which two of his passengers were killed.
   Aquino of Santa Paula entered the plea to two counts each of
vehicular manslaughter and drunken driving. A preliminary hearing
was set for Feb. 3.
   Killed in the Aug. 14 crash was Howard Thomas, 25, and Teresa
Bello, 20, passengers in the car driven by Aquino.
   Aquino failed to appear at his Dec. 7 preliminary hearing in
California and was arrested in Detroit on Dec. 9, moments after
losing a World Boxing Association title fight at Cobo Arena.
   He went into the fight, his first after the accident, as the
WBC's No. 3-ranked super welterweight contender. He held the title
briefly in 1987.
   ``The fight I was fighting was outside of the ring,'' Aquino said
after the match.

<HEAD>AIDS-Linked TB In Prisons Will Spill Into Communities, Researchers
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tuberculosis is on the rise in prisons,
paralleling the AIDS epidemic, and will inevitably spill into the
nation's communities, researchers reported today.
   ``Unless effective action is taken to intervene, the TB problem
in correctional facilities is likely to worsen during the next
decade,'' said researchers at the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   TB has made a comeback recently by attacking people whose immune
systems have been damaged by AIDS, health officials say.
   ``We must not be so naive as to think that this problem will
impact only on the prison system. ... TB can have an impact on the
communities into which inmates are released as well,'' said Dr.
Dixie E. Snider Jr. and Mary D. Hutton of the CDC.
   Their remarks appear in an editorial in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association, along with a study that found
tuberculosis rates have increased in New York prisons as the AIDS
epidemic has emerged.
   The authors of the study suggest the trend may be the same in
other parts of the country.
   TB struck fewer than one in 4,000 inmates annually from 1976
through 1979 in New York state prisons, but the rate more than
quadrupled to one in 948 inmates by the end of 1986, the study said.
   The study found that 56 percent of New York inmates with TB in
1985 and 1986 also were infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
   The study's authors, who called for prompt screening and
treatment, said the increase of TB in New York prisons occurred
primarily among men ages 30 to 49 in minority groups having a
history of previous drug use.
   They also are prime targets for AIDS, an incurable and fatal
disease that cripples the body's immune system and leaves people
susceptible to life-threatening infections.
   A similar connection with HIV has been observed with the increase
in TB cases in other parts of the country, the authors said.
   ``It has been suggested that (HIV) infection may be at least
partially responsible for this changing pattern,'' said the authors,
led by Dr. M. Miles Braun, formerly of the New York State Department
of Health and now of the CDC.
   Only a few years ago, health officials hoped that TB, which is
fully curable with long-term antibiotic treatment, could be
eradicated entirely from the country by the end of the century.
   The rate of new cases of TB had fallen about 5 percent a year
from 1953 to 1984. But in 1985, as AIDS was on the rise, the annual
number of tuberculosis cases in the United States decreased only 0.2
percent, and in 1986 the TB rate actually went up 0.2 percent, to
22,768 new cases, according to the CDC.
   TB caused 1,807 U.S. deaths in 1982, according to the National
Center for Health Statistics, which could not immediately provide
more recent figures.
   ``It is of crucial importance that TB control measures be
reinforced in the prison setting to counter the increased risk
created by human immunodeficiency virus infection,'' the study's
authors said.
   The study recommended prompt identification of inmates with TB,
along with isolation and treatment.
   Only 66 percent of state health departments routinely screen
prison inmates for TB and only 12 percent periodically screen them
again, said the editorial writers.
   A total of 1,964 AIDS cases had been reported in U.S. prisons by
October 1987, according to a clerk at the U.S. Bureau of Justice
Statistics in Washington.

   For the first time since the chilling collapse of
October 1987, the stock market is showing signs of heating up.
   In Thursday's trading the rally in prices that began slowly nine
weeks ago and intensified after New Year's closed in on a milestone.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 0.36 points to close
at 2,239.11, less than eight points shy of its closing level of
2,246.74 on Oct. 16, 1987.
   That meant the market was on the verge of recouping the entire
508 points it lost on Black Monday, Oct. 19 of that year.
   ``This rally is no flash in the pan,'' proclaimed William
LeFevre, an analyst at Advest Inc., in his latest market commentary.
   Given a rise in the Dow above 2,247, he said, ``a whole new crop
of converts from bear to bull will enter the marketplace with buy
orders.''
   Not everyone on Wall Street is ready to go that far just yet. But
most concede that stocks are emerging from the long shadow cast by
the crash.
   Brokerage offices around the country report a smattering of phone
calls from investors who shunned stocks all through 1988.
   Professional money managers confess to worrying lately not about
another bloodbath but about missing out on a possible rise in the
market.
   In the chart-conscious world of investing, many eyes have long
been focused on the gap between the lowest prices on Oct. 16, 1987,
and the highest ones recorded on the 19th.
   When that gap was ``filled in'' this month as the market rose,
many saw it as a sign of a wound being healed.
   The improvement in the financial mood does not appear to have
been inspired by any dramatic shift in the economic news.
   In fact, the backdrop has been largely negative _ interest rates
rising, the trade deficit widening and worries persisting about a
revival of inflation.
   To some analysts, however, that makes the rally all the more
impressive. If the larger-than-expected trade deficit reported by
the government on Wednesday had been announced six months or a year
ago, they say, it would have knocked the market for a loop.
   Instead, it barely created a ripple, and the Dow finished the day
up 24.11 points.
   To some observers, the rally is not a happy development but quite
possibly a trap. The optimists, though, think investors have at last
begun to recognize the impressive performance of the economy since
Black Monday.
   Norman Fosback, editor of the investment advisory letter Market
Logic, maintains that a good year is in store for both the economy
and the market.
   ``While the stock market could experience a moderate-sized
correction along the way _ most years get at least one _ the major
trend is up,'' Fosback says. ``As for a crash, well, forget it.''

   A runaway tank truck on a steep hill plowed
into five vehicles after its brakes failed Thursday, killing three
people and injuring three others, and authorities filed homicide
charges the truck driver.
   Mark Duncan, 27, of Clay City, Ind., was held on $300,000 bond
after his arraignment on three counts of vehicular homicide and
charges of reckless driving, driving too fast for conditions and
running a red light.
   Police said his truck's brakes failed as it descended the steep,
400-foot ridge of Mount Washington and struck two vans, a pickup
truck and a car before overturning and flattening another car about
2:20 p.m.
   The driver of the pickup truck, Gary Grimm, 29, of Pittsburgh
died at Mercy Hospital about an hour later, the Allegheny County
Coroner's Office said.
   Two men in the flattened car, James Nash, 70, and James Krigger,
62, both of suburban McCandless Township, were declared dead at the
scene after emergency crews worked nearly five hours to extricate
them, officials said.
   While some workers contained the truck's spilled cargo of
recycled oil, others dismantled a van in which Carmella Giarmita,
36, of Pittsburgh, was trapped. She was freed about two hours after
the crash and was taken to Allegheny County Hospital in critical
condition.
   The status of the third injured victim was not immediately
available, police said.
   Duncan, who was not injured, was questioned immediately after the
accident and authorities inspected the rig.
   ``An inspection showed the brake shoes are oil-soaked and have no
stopping power. Oil has totally penetrated the shoes,'' city Public
Safety Director Glenn Cannon said. ``There are a number of
violations related to the brake system, and the state will issue
citations.''
   Public Safety Department spokeswoman Margaret Rizza said the
crash closed all four lanes of Pennsylvania Route 51, delaying
evening rush-hours traffic on the major thoroughfare to Pittsburgh's
southern suburbs.
   Transportation officials said the road would remain closed
overnight.

   Ronald Reagan leaves the White House with an
unshaken belief that Americans are the ``custodians of freedom for
the world'' but frustration that he could not obtain that same
freedom for his nine countrymen still held hostage overseas.
   On the eve of his departure from the White House, Reagan
expressed his confidence in both the nation and his successor,
calling George Bush ``the man who should be in this office replacing
me.''
   Reagan was making a last nostalgic visit today to the Oval Office
where he presided as the nation's 40th president, spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Afterward, the president and first lady Nancy Reagan were slated
to bid a private farewell to the household staff in the residence.

   Democrats sidelined during the capital's
weeklong inaugural hoopla are spending the time assuring themselves
that their party will come later.
   For a group that hasn't been able to celebrate a presidential
victory since Jimmy Carter's 12 years ago, the glitz and indulgence
as GOP revelers took over Washington was a little hard to bear.
   ``If you're competitive, and you lose a contest, and you're at
the hall where the other side is having its victory celebration,
it's not a very uplifting time,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
   ``Democrats aren't just sitting around in a sour mood. But all of

   President Reagan's farewell from office today produced
celebrations by Nicaragua's Sandinista government, a gift horse from
Canada and thanks from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to a
``true and perfect gentleman.''
   The Japan Times today hailed him as the ``man of the decade,'' an
Australian newspaper called him ``a hard act to follow'' and even
ideological foes such as the Soviet Union have sent respectful
good-byes to Reagan.
   In Managua, however, the leftist Nicaraguan government planned
street parties, parades and political meetings to usher out Reagan,
whose administration financed anti-government rebels since 1981.
   ``The workers will show their ingenuity to mock imperialism and
the reactionaries in this country,'' the state Voice of Nicaragua

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel took steps
in his last day on the job to boost the nation's oil production by
granting new benefits to oil companies.
   Following reports this week of slumping U.S. oil production,
Hodel on Thursday lowered the rates oil companies pay to drill on
leased federal land and recommended the vast Alaska wildlife refuge
be opened to oil exploration.
   Decreasing the leasing fees for millions of acres in the West
could cost taxpayers an estimated $35 million annually, Marta Witt,
a spokeswoman for the department's Bureau of Land Management said.
   The move, published Thursday in the Federal Register and
scheduled to take effect March 1, will lower leasing rates that now
range from $2 to $3 down to $1 per acre.

   At least one in five American men has had one
or more homosexual experiences, and at least 3.3 percent have such
sexual contacts regularly, a National Research Council study says.
   Published today in the magazine Science, the study suggests that
the number of American men who have had at least one homosexual
experience is lower than the estimates compiled some 40 years ago by
famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.
   But Charles F. Turner, an NRC scientist and co-author of the new
study, said the current estimates are the lowest possible numbers.
He said there are still not enough data to establish a true number,
which would in all likelihood would be higher.
   ``All of the estimates that we have made are lower-bound
estimates,'' Turner said Thursday in a telephone interview. ``These
numbers are best treated as a minimum. We're not saying what the
true number is, but only that this is the best that can be done in
terms of setting a lower bound.''

   Differences in the brain structure of male
and female rats allow the males to learn to navigate a maze more
quickly, but females are less fooled by changes in landmarks, a
researcher says.
   ``It doesn't suggest that males or females are better at solving
spatial tasks,'' psychologist Christina Williams of Barnard College
of Columbia University in New York City, said Thursday. ``It merely
means they go about it in different ways.''
   Williams and Warren H. Meck, another Columbia researcher, also
found that brain structure can be altered in a way that seems to
improve memory by giving rats choline, a B vitamin rich in foods
common in traditional Japanese diets.
   Williams, speaking at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, said she believed there
were similarities between rats' brains and human brains, but said
she could draw no conclusions about human behavior from the maze
studies.

   New genetic findings will let doctors diagnose
``elephant man's disease'' before symptoms appear and help
scientists find the gene that causes the disease, which afflicts at
least 100,000 Americans, experts say.
   The findings will also permit prenatal diagnosis, they said
Thursday.
   Early diagnosis will allow doctors to act early to reduce the
severity of the disease, which causes tumors to grow anywhere in the
nervous system, and can lead to severe disfigurement, deafness,
blindness, brain cancers and spinal deformity.
   Some 40 percent to 60 percent of patients also suffer learning
disabilities.

   Tulips are popping up in Normandy, hedgehogs are
skipping hibernation in Britain, Muscovites are abandoning their fur
hats and Swiss ski resort operators are complaining.
   Europe is in the midst of a mild spell that not only is throwing
some seasonal clocks out of whack, but could cause serious economic
problems for businesses and farms.
   ``Skiing is impossible, but the ice rink is open and guests can
play cards,'' said a spokesman for the tourist office at San
Bernadino on the southern side of the Swiss Alps.
   ``Hedgehogs are not hibernating _ they are running about the
roads and being knocked down,'' said Sue Stocker, who runs a
wildlife hospital at Aylesbury, north of London. ``We have more than
100 hedgehog patients, more than twice the usual number.''

   Its Victorian splendor faded, this
Pacific port wistfully waits for its ship to come in again.
   Meanwhile, a lingering charm attracts sunbathing tourists and
sailors. Byzantine cobblestone alleys wind around its soaring hills,
plied by antique cable cars, and painted wooden fishing boats bob
among the huge cargo ships in the sparkling blue bay.
   But many of its 290,000 inhabitants openly pine for the days when
Valparaiso, as a bustling center of commerce and culture, lived up
to its name _valley of paradise.
   ``It has a strong personality, always has,'' said Francisco
Velasco, 67. ``Unfortunately, it's decaying, it's going downhill,
it's dying.''
   ``Everything has moved to Santiago,'' the capital city 70 miles
inland, he said. ``The big industries, the intellectual centers, the
artistic centers, all to Santiago. Here there's nothing.''
   Velasco, a retired physician turned writer, spoke in an interview
at his hillside home, a rambling six-story structure he shared with
friend Pablo Neruda, the Nobel Prize-winning poet, until Neruda's
death in 1973.
   Forty years ago, Neruda called Valparaiso ``the mountainous
capital of the great ocean'' with slopes that ``glitter with the red
and blue paint of toyshops.''
   Now the paint is peeling. On the hillsides, covered with
precarious zinc-roofed shanties, mansions built by affluent traders
and ship captains totter in disrepair, abandoned or chopped up into
tenements. The 17 cable cars are run down, their tracks rusty.
   ``It isn't like it used to be,'' said Carlos Brito, a 76-year-old
cable car operator on a hill called Alegre (Happy). Several of the
city's 42 hills carry whimsical names, like Delights, Butterfly,
Milkmen or Pleasures.
   Brito recalled that, decades ago, the city ``was lovely, the most
beautiful. There were places to go out and dance at night.''
   Now he rarely goes out after dark, explaining: ``The boys catch
you and give you hugs and kisses.'' He meant the young thieves mug
you.
   Like most residents, Mayor Alejandro Navarrete attributes the
city's decline to the building of the Panama Canal in the early
1900s.
   Before the canal, Valparaiso was a port of call for many ships
steaming between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans around Cape Horn on
the tip of South America. ``The city was very, very important,'' the
47-year-old Navarrete said. ``There were always 100 or 200 ships in
the bay.''
   Local shipping and some industry kept the city going for decades.
But in the early 1980s, when a severe recession struck Chile,
several big factories closed or moved to Santiago.
   Unemployment soared to more than 20 percent. It has since
declined to a still-painful 12 percent.
   Even so, Valparaiso's docks have never handled so much cargo,
thanks in large part to Chile's booming fruit exports. Last year a
record three million tons of goods passed through the port, 11
percent more than in 1987. It included 70 million crates of exported
grapes, peaches, apples and other fruit, up 20 percent from the
previous year.
   In part because of that activity, Navarette believes Valparaiso's
luck is turning.
   His hopes for a real resurgence are pinned on President Augusto
Pinochet's plan to move Chile's Congress to Valparaiso. Congress,
which has been suspended since Pinochet, the right-wing army
commander, seized power in a bloody 1973 coup, is scheduled to
reopen in 1990.
   A new $41 million-Congress building is going up at a Valparaiso
intersection. So are surrounding property values.
   Navarrete confidently predicts that, once Congress is installed,
it will approve a project that has been the dream of the city
fathers for decades: a train linking Valparaiso with Santiago.
   ``With the new technology ... it could easily go 250 or 300
kilometers (150 or 185 miles) an hour,'' he said. ``You could get
from Santiago to Valparaiso in 50 minutes tops.''
   Navarrete's optimism clashes, however, with that of
Valparaiso-born Sergio Spoerer, a sociologist who now lives in
Santiago but comes back regularly.
   ``We are prisoners of nostalgia,'' he said.
   ``We tend to see our future in terms of rescuing some lost
innocence, and that keeps us from working together toward a real
future.''

   When Johnny Clegg and his
multiracial band, Savuka, sing about Nelson Mandela to an
African-based rock beat, thousands of white hands sway above blond
heads in a dimly lit auditorium.
   The pounding rhythm, the haunting melody, the lyrics about
imprisoned black leader Mandela, and the cheering, clapping
teen-agers present an emotional scene. But most in the audience
don't understand the chorus, which is sung in the Zulu language, or
the meaning of the song's title, ``Asimbonanga,'' (You Are Far Away
From Us).
   Yet Clegg, a 35-year-old white who has spent 22 years trying to
fuse African music with Western traditions, believes he is making a
difference in South African history simply by giving white youths a
``good feeling'' when they sing about a black revolutionary.
   ``They're singing about Nelson Mandela, man. People are looking
around nervously, saying, `Wow, this is heavy.' It's an experience
for them,'' said Clegg, the most successful rock star in South
Africa, in a post-concert interview.
   ``If I can just allow an alternative idea or image to occupy
someone's brain for two hours which has never been allowed in
because of their church or their political views or emotional views,
but to slot it in because of a beat, a vibe, a feeling, an emotion
in the crowd, I've done my job. The next day, when they read about
Mandela or some detainees, it's not so far away, so abstract.''
   As a teen-ager, Clegg became interested in the Zulu guitar music
played by his family's gardener. He was arrested at 16 for sneaking
into a government hostel for migrant black workers where he learned
to play the guitar, dance and speak Zulu.
   Clegg's first band, Jaluka, was formed in partnership with a
friend from the hostel, but the African-based folk music and street
guitar jive were not commercially successful.
   ``Jaluka was a romantic cultural journey,'' Clegg said. ``Savuka
is a hard-core group dealing with dark experiences in this country,
put together in a hopeful way. ... That is something I think the
world and South Africa are ready for. I feel myself part of a
progressive cultural stream which has started to trickle out.''
   Although Clegg is outspokenly anti-apartheid and his seven-member
band has more blacks (four) than whites, the British Musicans Union
and Anti-Apartheid Movement continue to picket his concerts and ban
him from live television performances in Britain.
   Clegg says he is victimized by the same ``confusion'' that dogged
American singer Paul Simon when he brought black South African
artists to worldwide attention in his ``Graceland'' tour and album.
   Some anti-apartheid activists in Europe oppose performances by
anyone who also performs in South Africa, even if the artists are
black South Africans. Savuka was not included in the ``Free
Mandela'' rock concert in London last June, although Clegg
consistently calls for the African National Congress leader's
release from his sentence of life in prison.
   Clegg hopes his affiliation with the American Musicians Union
will end the boycott on his next trip to Britain.
   He has been wildly popular in France, where he is known as ``le
Zulu blanc'' (the white Zulu); his ``Third World Child'' album is a
million-seller. He has been a curtain-raiser for David Bowie, George
Michael and Sting. But on its own in foreign venues, Savuka's
biggest draw has been 2,500 to 3,000 at the Wiltern Theater in Los
Angeles and the Beacon in New York City.
   He will return to Los Angeles at the end of March to record a new
album.
   Savuka's Johannesburg homecoming concerts Jan. 13-14 drew the
largest audiences of his career, four sold-out performances of 5,000
to 6,000 people each, almost all of them white.
   ``My constituency is a white constituency,'' said Clegg, whose
energetic Zulu dancing elicits wild cheers from young white fans.
   ``They will be the generation which has to deal with the
transition, and you cannot deal with transition emotionally or
psychically if you don't have a cultural tradition or root that you
can relate to. I'm helping to give them an idea of where they could
find one.''

<HEAD>Madame Tussaud's Goes From Wax to Ferris Wheels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A big toy leopard in a pink tutu sits near the desk
of Madame Tussaud's chief executive, but it isn't made of the waxy
stuff that attracts 2.5 million visitors a year.
   Michael Herbert's office mate is a fiberglass leftover from a
children's exhibit, and a sign of the company's future. For Tussauds
isn't just into wax anymore.
   The company, whose waxworks were brought from Paris to London 186
years ago by the enterprising Madame, has bought a medieval castle
and a set of caves, owns one theme park and plans to build another
for $90 million at a stately home. It's also delving into non-wax
Disney-style animated figures.
   But Tussauds hasn't forsaken its roots. Its wax statues pop up at
new ventures and the original exhibition has been London's top
fee-paying tourist site for two years.
   To a celebrity, few accolades are greater than an invitation to
pose for a Tussaud effigy, and to the public it's a true sign of the
passage of fame when a wax statue gets taken to the storeroom. Its
Chamber of Horrors, with its freshly guillotined heads and
disemboweled Jack the Ripper victims have given generations of
children sleepless nights.
   ``Madame Tussaud's is something we rather crudely say you would
visit three times in your life: as a child, a parent and perhaps a
grandparent,'' says Herbert, a gentle man who clearly delights in
the fun side to his business, like his leopard.
   ``Wax exhibitions need a turnover of people,'' he said in an
interview, noting that more than half of Madame Tussaud's visitors
come from abroad. ``Therefore it's no use going to set up a wax
exhibition in somewhere like Cleveland, Ohio or even Chicago.''
   Marie Tussaud, an accomplished sculptress in Paris, inherited the
waxworks from the uncle who trained her. She had made deathmasks of
guillotine victims including Marie Antoinette, but finding
post-Revolutionary France too chaotic for business, she moved to
England in 1802.
   A marketing whiz in her time, she guaranteed new audiences for
the waxworks by touring Britain for 33 years before settling in
London at age 74. Here she displayed her last work _ a scowling
self-portrait in spectacles and black bonnet which is among the 350
figures presently on display in the permanent exhibit on the
Marylebone Road.
   After her death, the exhibit grew somewhat ``fusty-dusty,''
Herbert said, but tourism boosted revenue in the 1960s and it has
flourished in recent years with stepped-up marketing.
   Tussauds _ the company as opposed to Madame Tussaud's, the
waxworks _ first expanded in 1970 with an exhibition in Amsterdam
which has been so successful that the company hopes to move to a
bigger site.
   It bought the Wookey Hole Caves in western England, a popular
tourist spot, in 1973 and was attempting to buy the Chessington Zoo,
now the Chessington World of Adventures, in 1978 when its owner, the
Pearson PLC conglomerate, struck back by buying Tussauds.
   Soon after, Tussauds bought 13th-century Warwick Castle, for then
$2.7 million, and has installed a startlingly lifelike exhibit
re-creating with wax figures a typical 19th-century royal weekend.
   Tussauds' planned amusement park at Woburn Abbey, the
18th-century stately home of the Duke of Bedford, would be
impossible without Pearson's backing, says Herbert, who is a
director of Cedafair LP, an Ohio-based amusement company, sees great
potential in this sector in Britain.
   ``After all, we are still a very small company, with turnover of
30 million pounds ($55 million),'' he said. ``To do this alone would
really be sticking your neck out.''
   Expansions aside, Tussaud vows never to abandon wax. But the old
standbys, which cost an average of $18,000 apiece, are being
improved and paired with newfangled figures.
   Next year, Tussauds will open a London exhibition of both wax and
non-wax animated figures representing rock stars.
   ``Rock Circus'' continues the Disney-style animation work begun
with an exhibition near Windsor Castle, on the outskirts of London,
called ``Royalty and Empire,'' which re-creates a scene from Queen
Victoria's Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 1897.
   ``Static wax figures are something we've been famous for more
than 180 years,'' says spokeswoman Juliet Simpkins. ``What we're
doing (with animation) is enhancing the illusion.''
   Also, she said, the mother exhibition on Marylebone Road uses
more audiovisual aids with its figures. But plain old wax still
holds its fascination.
   ``Are you sleeping?'' a small girl recently asked a young wax
prince frozen in time. ``Will you wake up?''

<HEAD>Saving Ancient Psalms Was New Challenge for Conservators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservation specialists in Egypt worked for
more than two years to save a 1,600-year-old book of Psalms, one of
the country's most important historic finds of recent years.
   But Nasry Iskander, chemist and chief conservator of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization, wasn't sure at first if he would succeed.
   The book was in very bad condition when it was found in November
1984, saturated with water and salt, and around 490 parchment pages
were stuck together in a heap between wooden covers.
   Today, Iskander proudly says the book, which scholars say is the
world's oldest complete book of Psalms, is in remarkable condition
for a relic of its age.
   ``We'd never seen such a book before in Egypt. I was wild about
it,'' he said. ``We struggled to find a way to separate the
parchment pages one by one without damaging anything. Not a single
page could be harmed.''
   He said conservation work is much more difficult on parchment
than on papyrus, the two materials commonly used by early Egyptian
writers. ``I touched everything as a blind person, as though I were
dealing in the dark, because we knew nothing,'' Iskander said.
   His first break came when he unbound two nine-page sections from
their leather holders, giving him a manageable number of pages to
determine a method for separating the others.
   By trial and error in raising and lowering humidity, using tissue
and waxed paper between sheets, Iskander separated, then flattened,
some of the pages. Others followed, some pried with non-metallic
utensils such as levers made of ivory or lemon wood. Some of the
parchment pages were stuck with salt accumulated from readers'
fingertips.
   Coptic scholar Gawdat Gabra, director of Cairo's Coptic Museum,
said he wasn't very excited when antiquities officials telephoned
him to say that a book written in the ancient Coptic language had
just been discovered in a cemetery 85 miles south of Cairo.
   ``But the next day, when I saw the book, I knew instantly how
important it was,'' Gabra said. ``Only every 50 or 100 years does
something like this come to light, if ever. It's among the top
Coptic finds of the second half of the 20th century.''
   Antiquities inspectors excavating the graveyard found the book
beneath the head of a 12-year-old girl.
   ``We had here a complete book, with covers, and it came from a
grave excavated by antiquities inspectors,'' Gabra said. ``For the
first time we had everything together. ... Other manuscripts are
incomplete.''
   He said the lack of expert documentation makes the origins of
such other early biblical manuscripts as the Sinai Codex and the
Mississippi Codex historically unclear and questionable because they
surfaced through individuals or dealers.
   A number of important biblical finds have been discovered in
Egypt, where many Jews sought sanctuary from various invasions of
Palestine and Judea. The Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria inherited
Hebrew Scriptures that later were preserved partly through the
efforts of early Christian churches.
   Alexandria's Greek Bible became the official Bible of Christian
communities in Egypt and throughout the Greek-speaking world. In
Egypt, whose Coptic church traditionally was founded by St. Mark in
A.D. 79, Scriptures were translated into native dialects to meet the
demands of peasant communities that did not speak Greek.
   The major biblical find of the 20th century was the discovery of
the Dead Sea Scrolls four decades ago in what is now Israel. They
are leather and papyrus fragments of many of the books of the Old
Testament and other pre-Christian era documents. Their early origins
and texts changed biblical history.

<TEXT>
   CIA agents, as depicted in the new public
television series ``Secret Intelligence,'' could remind you of
wealthy in-laws _ you might curse their existence, but they can come
in handy in tough times.
   Debuting tonight on most Public Broadcasting Service stations,
the four-part ``Secret Intelligence'' series chronicles the
four-decade growth of American espionage outfits. This critical
history concludes that U.S. intelligence agencies have come to be
omnipotent giants, both ``protecting'' democracy and, at times,
undermining it.
   In most matters of espionage, ``the normal rules of combat do not
apply,'' series host Bill Kurtis says in his narration. ``The only
rule is, win.'' That philosophy, not surprisingly, can lead to
tangles.
   Specifically, to save us from communism, ``Secret Intelligence''
says, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI borrowed techniques mastered by the
Soviet secret police. To encourage his brand of leadership in
Nicaragua, Lt. Col. Oliver North allegedly lied to the U.S. Congress
and secretly diverted money to the Contras.
   Using these and other case studies, ``Secret Intelligence'' aims
to illustrate the fundamental clash between an open, honest
government and the increasingly forceful role covert intelligence
plays in arms control, fighting terrorism and maintaining world
peace.
   But who's a terrorist? Who defines world peace? Who is there to
protect us from America's ``secret warriors?'' Who will watch the
watchers? These are just some of the questions ``Secret
Intelligence'' attempts to answer.
   ``It is more difficult to run secret operations in a society in
which the Congress supervises what's going on,'' former CIA Director
William Colby says in the program, ``but that's the cost of having
the kind of constitutional government we have, and in my view it's
well worth it.''
   While clearly not a new dilemma, the issue grows more timely with
the presidential inauguration of a former CIA director, George Bush,
and the impending start of North's trial, scheduled for Jan. 31.
   ``Secret Intelligence'' unfolds in weekly chapters, with each of
the four segments addressing a specific intelligence concern. The
show alternates between intelligence victories _ the achievements of
code breakers is especially prominent _ and espionage shortcomings.
   The first episode, ``The Only Rule Is Win,'' looks at the origins
of the FBI and the CIA, focusing on the collapse of intelligence
analysis before the bombing of Pearl Harbor and, in contrast, the
win-at-all-costs tactics used by U.S. government-trained operatives
in Burma.
   ``Intervention,'' the second installment, examines the worldwide
emergence of the CIA as a secret army after World War II. The hour
documents the CIA's orchestration of coups in Iran and Guatemala.
   Part three, ``Learning to Say No,'' inspects the scandals and
failed efforts _ the Bay of Pigs, assassination attempts, the
counterinsurgency program in Vietnam _ that plagued intelligence
operations in the 1960s and '70s.
   The final episode, ``The Enterprise,'' traces the roots of the
Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages scandal and FBI harassment of U.S.
citizens who opposed the Reagan administration's foreign policy.
   All of the shows feature interviews with intelligence experts,
former operatives, journalists and six past CIA directors, including
Colby, Richard Helms and the late William Casey, seen in his last
television interview.
   ``Our intention here is not to do an expose,'' series executive
producer Blaine Baggett said at a recent news conference about the
show. ``We don't have the time, the resources or the money.''
   Baggett acknowledged that the series, made at a cost of $1.2
million, was difficult to assemble visually. ``The whole dilemma of
doing this series,'' he said, is that ``you don't have file footage
that the CIA is going to turn over to you to illustrate its covert
acts.''
   Host Kurtis said the series will deliver ``a broad, contextual
understanding of how and why'' U.S. intelligence agencies operate.
   It is the kind of program that the three networks no longer do,
said Kurtis, a CBS veteran. The networks ``have closed up the large
documentary units,'' Kurtis said. ``PBS is the only place you will
see this.''
   If the series leaves viewers with a lasting impression, it is
that even in an era of more attentive congressional oversight,
covert intelligence operations will continue.
   ``Can we run secret operations?'' Colby asked at the news
conference. ``The answer is yes.''

<HEAD>Mistrust Deep as Factions Prepare for Elections in Namibia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mistrust and acrimony are evident on all
sides as Namibia's political factions maneuver for early advantage
in the election campaign that will bring independence later this
year.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which began a
guerrilla war against South African rule in 1966, claims South
Africa is training a rebel army to overthrow SWAPO if it wins in the
balloting Nov. 1.
   SWAPO's political opponents hope to win a significant share of
power and suggest that the guerrilla movement might return to
insurgency rather than join a coalition government.
   Both camps fear their rivals will try to intimidate voters, and
there is widespread doubt about the effectiveness of a United
Nations force of up to 7,500 men due to arrive April 1 to monitor
the election. South Africa worries that the U.N. force will be
biased in SWAPO's favor.
   ``My only hope is that we make sure the electoral process is so
peaceful that the result will be accepted by winner and loser, so we
don't have a Lebanon here,'' said Moses Katjiuongua, a black who
serves in the territorial Cabinet and plans to campaign against
SWAPO.
   ``We need a mechanism for addressing grievances, so we don't get
to a point where SWAPO decides to resume the armed struggle if it
loses the election.''
   For SWAPO, the political battle is to gain two-thirds of the
vote. U.N. Resolution 435, which outlines the independence process,
specifies that the assembly elected to draft a new constitution for
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, can act only with support
of two-thirds of the delegates.
   SWAPO officials allege that South Africa is bringing Angolans and
other non-Namibians into northern districts with the intention of
registering them as voters. SWAPO also contends that South African
security forces are visiting villages on anti-SWAPO propaganda
missions.
   South African military headquarters has denied all accusations
that its forces will interfere with the election.
   Although all but 1,500 of South Africa's troops are to be
withdrawn before the formal start of the election campaign June 25,
SWAPO officials are concerned that the territorial police force
might play an intimidating role.
   South Africa has agreed to reduce the strength of the police
force from 8,300 to 7,100, but the smaller force will include most
members of Koevoet, a mainly black counter-insurgency unit which is
being disbanded. Anton Lubowksi, a lawyer who is one of SWAPO's few
white members, has charged that Koevoet personnel are ``programmed
killers.''
   Jerry Ekandjo, SWAPO's chief spokesman in Windhoek, said SWAPO,
if it took power, would conduct a rehabilitation program for former
security force members and other Namibians who ``have been misled by
the enemy.''
   But SWAPO supporters ``will not take the law into their own
hands,'' he said.
   Katjiuongua, the Cabinet member, denounced the proposed
rehabilitation program and said a violent reaction was probable if a
SWAPO government pursued a policy of ``punish the puppets and
traitors.'' But he denied allegations that South Africa had asked
him to form a rebel army in the event of a SWAPO victory.
   The factions opposing SWAPO _ ranging from right-wing whites to
former SWAPO officials _ are engaged in negotiations on possible
alliances. As many as three coalitions, as well as a few individual
parties, could compete against the guerrilla movement for support
among Namibia's 1.3 million people.
   ``We are not against the creation of new political parties, but
we're concerned that they are being funded by South Africa with the
sole objective of denying SWAPO a two-thirds majority,'' SWAPO
official Hage Geingob told a recent conference in Zambia. He said
some of these groups might become ``the terrorists of tomorrow.''
   Spokesman Ekandjo, like some other SWAPO officials, refused to
even discuss the possibility that his movement would get less than
two-thirds of the vote.
   ``We've been fighting all these years to win,'' he said.
   But Nathaniel Mahuilili, acting president of SWAPO in Namibia,
said: ``If we lose, we're not going back to war.''
   SWAPO would participate in a coalition, he said, and work to
ensure outright victory whenever elections next took place.

<HEAD>Colorful Peronist is Front-Runner for Argentine Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Saul Menem, a Peronist and
leading candidate for president, drives race cars, flies planes,
smiles easily, wears his hair to his shoulders and likes to be
photographed with showgirls.
   The 53-year-old provincial governor is colorful in a way that
intrigues an electorate weary of the burdens of Argentina's foreign
debt, energy crisis, triple-digit inflation, rising unemployment,
and political and social tensions.
   Union members and the poor are the core of Menem's Peronist Party
constituency. They ignore his gaffes and policy gaps, and remember
his promises of a brighter tomorrow, his visits to their factory or
village, the naturalness with which he slips a gaucho poncho over
his head and sips mate tea and the five years he spent in prison
during the 1976-83 military dictatorship.
   ``It's easy for me to communicate with people,'' Menem said in an
interview at his campaign office. ``I talk with everyone. I feel at
home in the most humble places.''
   Menem's main rival in the elections set for May 14 is Eduardo
Angeloz of the governing Radical Civic Union.
   The Peronist has been the front-runner since his upset nomination
last July, though his lead narrowed from 37 percent to 30 in a
recent nationwide survey by the agency Mora y Araujo, Noguero and
Associates.
   Two other candidates trail by wide margins in that and virtually
every other poll. The number of undecideds remained high at 19
percent.
   Menem and Angeloz, once classmates at the National University of
Cordoba law school in the 1950s, are as different as the
side-by-side provinces they govern.
   Angeloz's Cordoba is a rich, populous, industrial hub of 2.5
million.
   He prides himself on being a good administrator, and supports the
policies of the President Raul Alfonsin, including privatizing
Argentina's costly public services, paying off the foreign debt, and
basing economic growth on increased exports.
   Menem's La Rioja is a poor, sparsely populated province of
200,000 where high technology is needed to coax seedless grapes and
jojoba, whose oils are used in hair preparations, from desert sand
and heat. As many people who can work for the government.
   Menem was born and reared in La Rioja, the second of four sons of
Syrian immigrants who founded a successful vineyard and winery.
   He notes with pride he has been re-elected twice, and does not
dwell on the fact that his deficit-ridden province issues its own
currency that is worthless elsewhere, nor on the national
implications of his solution to economic stagnation: increased
public spending.
   Eager for middle class support to push him past the 50 percent
minimum he needs in the popular vote to win the election outright,
Menem says he will honor the country's foreign debt obligations and
promote political stability, social harmony and economic growth.
   Businessmen and professionals, however, are wary of his plans for
such things as a ``social pact'' between labor, capital and
government. The pact would, he insists, help set budget policy,
resolve wage disputes, establish price levels.
   Many middle-class voters are troubled by the gaps between Menem's
proposed policies and his personal opinions.
   Argentina's nearly $60-billion foreign debt will be honored,
Menem says, although he maintains that repayment is a ``true
immorality,'' given the country's need for investment capital. He
says he will seek to negotiate a five-year moratorium.
   Menem also attracts criticism random remarks that rarely are
substantiated or followed up. For example, he has said:
   _The Peronist Party might try to impeach Alfonsin on grounds of
mishandling the economy.
   _Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, a military rebel leader, is a
``brilliant'' soldier.
   _Fidel Castro has dramatically improved life in Cuba.
   _Paraguay's dictator, Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, is a ``good
friend'' of Argentina.
   ``What kind of government can we expect from that candidate and
that party?'' asks Congresswoman Maria Christina Guzman. ``The
Argentine people know well enough. There is a great danger that that
government would be, simply, the waiting room to chaos.''
   Angeloz, who also heads the Independent Federal Confederation
ticket on which Ms. Guzman is the vice presidential candidate, calls
Menem's proposals ``demagogic,'' ``magic prescriptions'' and
``simplistic.''
   Yet, Menem's rallies are well attended, his appearances in
mass-market magazines frequent.
   In speeches and interviews, he quotes the Bible, European
statesmen and philosophers _ and his party's revered founder and
namesake, Gen. Juan Domingo Peron, president in 1946-55 and for 10
months ending with his death in 1973.

<HEAD>Bush's National Security Adviser Says Foreign Policy Rests With President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 11 years since he last worked in the
White House, Brent Scowcroft has not minced words about his views on
strategic policies, to the point of openly criticizing the Reagan
administration on occasion.
   Now, in his opening days as President Bush's national security
adviser, Scowcroft is shying away from discussing how his personal
views might translate into Bush administration policy.
   ``The secretary of state should be the chief spokesman for the
president's foreign policy. And the president makes foreign
policy,'' Scowcroft, smiling, said in an interview with The
Associated Press. The national security adviser should be ``not
exactly invisible,'' but certainly not in the spotlight.
   Reticence aside, Scowcroft's influence promises to be as great as
his experience. Bush and Scowcroft worked closely once before, when
Bush was CIA director in 1976 and Scowcroft was national security
adviser to President Ford.
   Scowcroft, 63, said he has gained a sense of perspective since he
began his first job at the White House, as military aide to Henry
Kissinger on the National Security Council staff in 1972. He rose
quickly, from the rank of Air Force colonel to three-star general,
and to national security adviser 1975-77 after Ford replaced Richard
Nixon and Kissinger became secretary of state.
   ``I've probably written and said more about the organization and
the function of the NSC system than...,'' Scowcroft said, pausing,
``...anyone in the country.''
   He has a daunting assignment this time around, to direct a
complete review of U.S. strategic interests, an assessment that many
arms control experts predict will change the American negotitating
position toward the Soviets and in the Pentagon budget that Reagan
sent to Capitol Hill earlier this month.
   The tasks seems to rest lightly on Scowcroft's thin shoulders. He
is balding and slight, five feet eight inches tall, and weighs 130
pounds, ``probably a little less than I did at West Point, because I
had more muscle then.''
   He keeps trim by jogging about three miles a night, after
watching ABC's ``Nightline'' late night interview show.
   Born in Ogden, Utah, he counts the Mormon Church and his faher as
the significant early influences in his life.
   ``There is a notion among the Mormons that at the end of each day
you ought to be able say, `I've made myself a better person or I
have made things better by what I have done today,'' said Scowcroft.
   But, he said, ``I am not a strict Mormon. I frequently have a
glass of wine with dinner.'' And ``I enjoy coffee. I like to work at
night,'' said Scowcroft, who has disciplined himself to work on four
hours of sleep a night.
   ``Every once in a while, I crash. And when I operate this way, I
fall asleep at the drop of hat,'' he said.
   ``I learned to do that from Henry Kissinger, who does not require
much sleep, especially on trips ... we used to take. About 1 o'clock
in the morning he would issue to the staff a whole bunch of things
he wanted done by the next morning, then he would go to bed and get
up at 5:30 and expect to have them done,'' said Scowcroft with a
hearty laugh.
   Scowcroft lives in a modest brick home in Bethesda with Marian,
his wife of 37 years. Their daughter Karen works as an attorney in
New York.
   Since leaving the White House and retiring from the military,
Scowcroft has worked in the Washington office of Kissinger's
international consulting firm, and has served as a member of the
commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair and chairman of
a presidential panel on strategic missile basing.
   The basing panel, known as the Scowcroft Commission, charted some
policies that are sharply at odds with those of the Reagan
administratrion. Scowcroft has come out strongly in favor of a
single-warhead mobile missile, known as the Midgetman.
   And he ridiculed the administration for proposing, at the Moscow
summit, a system to base 10-warhead MX missiles on rail lines on
small bases in the Southwest, a plan he said in an op-ed piece last
year would make them sitting ducks.
   None of these ideas, he has written, make sense under a proposed
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty that would limit the number of both
warheads and delivery vehicles, such as missles and bombers.
   Such a regime, Scowcroft has written, argues for single-warhead
mobile missiles dispersed over a large area, such as the Midgetman.
   However Reagan, in his last budget proposal, killed funding for
the Midgetman in favor of the 10-warhead MX missile, which would be
deployed on rail cars on large bases in the Southwest.
   Scowcroft declines to say publicly what he recommended to Bush on
such issues. Bush, for his part, said during the campaign that he
liked both the MX and the Midgetman, although budget constraints
argue against deploying both.
   Scowcroft prefers to discuss his vision of a White House security
adviser with the leisure ``to try to do some long-range planning, to
sort of look out ahead, to hypothesize the kind of world that we
would like to see, and then to look at the kind of forces that are
at work for or against that kind of world.''
   ``And I think that where we want to go has an importance that it
really hasn't had for much of the 40 years of the Cold War, and that
is, a lot of the old truths, Cold War relations with the allies,
economic relations, all those things are changing now,'' he said.
   ``We are no longer just trying to frantically hold the line in
Europe, for example, to Europe not an incitement to agression by the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   The world has changed vastly since Scowcroft was 12 and read a
book called ``West Point Today.''
   ``I fell in love with West Point, not with the military as such
... I didn't go because I wanted to spend 30 years in the
military,'' said Scowcroft, who spent 29 years in uniform.
   After graduating from West Point in 1947, Scowcroft joined the
newly created Air Force and flew fighters until he crashed in a P-51
Mustang.
   ``I would rather call it a forced landing,'' he said with a
laugh. ``A crash sounds totally uncontrolled.''
   The forced landing crushed three vertebrae, and he spent two
years in a hospital, recuperating and missing the Korean War.
   Denied the opportunity to fly in combat, Scowcroft switched
tracks, earning masters and doctoral degrees from Columbia
University, teaching Russian history at West Point, learning
Serbo-Croatian, and serving as deputy air attache at the U.S.
embassy in Yugoslavia 1959-61.
   Reflecting on his years in uniform and at the White House,
Scowcroft says he would like to be remembered by the epitath: ``He
served with distinction.''

   The laser had many inventors, but only one,
Gordon Gould, is getting rich from it.
   Gould owns basic patents on two of the most important kinds of
lasers, gas discharge and optically pumped, based on his graduate
work at Columbia University in the late 1950s.
   Gould, 68, estimates he will make close to $2 million a year from
patent licenses once all potential licensees are signed up. Most
already are.
   ``I was always more interested in the monetary outcome than any
glory,'' Gould, now a venture capitalist, said in an interview this
past week.
   Ironically, Gould is reaping profits from lasers precisely
because it took until the 1980s for the Patent Office to recognize
his contributions.
   Patents protect inventions for only 17 years: If Gould had won
patents right away they would have expired by now, before the laser
market got big enough to produce significant license fees.
   Gould owns only 20 percent of the income from his patents.
Sixty-four percent is owned by the licensing agent, Patlex Corp. of
Los Angeles, headed by Frank Borman, the former astronaut and
ex-Eastern Airlines president. The rest is owned by Refac Technology
Development Corp., the original licensing agent.
   Many laser makers and users say Patlex is charging too much for
use of the Gould patents. To that complaint, the inventor has a
one-word answer: ``Tough.''
   Two other laser pioneers, brothers-in-law Charles Townes and
Arthur Schawlow, shared a basic laser patent, but never profited
from it.
   Schawlow worked at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories at the time of their
work and Townes, a Columbia University professor, served as a
consultant.
   ``I feel I have an adequate livelihood and I'm not concerned
about it,'' Townes, 73, recalled in an interview last year. ``I'd
rather think about other things as long as I can get money to
support my research.''
   Townes said he continues to use lasers in astrophysics research _
``It's like getting a microscope on the sky.''
   Gould takes an unsentimental approach to the laser but admits he
had an emotional moment about four years ago.
   ``I had eye surgery to pin back a detached retina. You can
imagine how I felt to be looking into that laser and knowing I
played a part in getting it there.''

   In a radical break with communist ideology, three
Chinese economists have come up with a proposal to distribute
state-owned property to the people in the form of stocks and bonds.
   Another group of young thinkers wants to establish a nationwide
stock exchange based on the U.S. model with a Chinese version of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   If realized, the proposals would fundamentally change China's
economy and forever alter its political structure.
   Chances are slim that the proposals will win immediate approval,
but the promulgators are confident that in the long run China has no
choice but to accept them.
   That they are actually getting a hearing among Chinese leaders is
an indication that the state is unsure about its economic future and
is looking for new solutions.
   Among the plethora of economic theories being debated in academic
circles and in the official press of today's China, the proposals
lie on the radical fringe and stand as testimony to a new tolerance
of ideas once regarded as heretical.
   Whether they will be put into effect is a different matter.
   At the Institute of Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, Hua Sheng, Zhang Xuejun and Luo Xiaopeng have decided that
China must abandon state ownership, which lies at the root of the
Communist Party state.
   In its stead they propose a system coyly termed ``individual''
ownership. What they mean is private ownership but those words are
still taboo in the land of Karl Marx and Mao Tse-tung.
   They also want the state to stop funding universities and
think-tanks in a move designed to give China more free thought.
   ``Our goal is to liberate the Chinese people,'' said Hua, the
36-year-old director of the microeconomics department at the
institute. ``Social justice, the right of self-realization, is the
essence of socialism. And that has nothing to do with state
control.''
   ``If we are to advance, the government must stop treating the
people like little children,'' added Zhang, 35, a senior research
fellow at the academy. ``And the people must take responsibility for
their lives.''
   Most of China's economy is state-run.
   In the past, state-run enterprises had to turn all of their
profits over to the state, which then handed funds back to the
enterprises in accordance with their importance to society.
   But under reforms pushed since 1978, state-run companies have
been allowed to keep some of their profits.
   The problem, said Zhang, is that because the companies are still
publicly owned few really seek profits. And if they do, the profits
aren't used to benefit the company, they're used to benefit its
managers, he added.
   ``In some companies, the factory manager is like a little
emperor, handing out bonuses to the people he likes.''
   In other firms, managers avoid profits to assure themselves
sources of scarce raw materials.
   ``Take the bicycle industry,'' Zhang said in an recent interview.
``Its prices have been freed for about a year but there's no true
market. Why? Because manufacturers keep their prices low and sell to
other firms who supply them with raw materials.''
   The trio criticizes China's program to free prices as misguided
because, they say, it has put the economic cart before the horse.
   ``Under our current system, freed prices won't create a market
because everything is still controlled by the state,'' Hua said.
   Their solution: China should convert most enterprises not
involved in national security to privately owned firms.
   First, university research institutes and other academic
organizations would be given ``capital coupons'' with which they
could purchase shares in companies.
   By doing this, the state would cut the amount of financial
support it gives to these institutes. And the institutes would
become independent of the state and its ideological controls.
   The second step entails the distribution of these ``capital
coupons'' to workers in state enterprises. The workers would use the
coupons to buy shares in companies or to buy a house.
   ``We made a big mistake when we outlawed property rights,'' Hua
said, referring to changes promulgated since China's Communist
revolution 40 years ago. ``Such rights really are the key to
political rights and economic rights. We need to win them back.''
   Under a second plan proposed by a group of young,
Western-educated economists, the workers and institutions would be
able to trade their shares in companies on a national stock exchange.
   The exchange would be overseen by a governmental organization
based on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to
Wang Poming, who was an analyst at the New York Stock Exchange
before returning to China last year.
   Unlike the current situation in China, where ``stocks'' pay fixed
interest and act more like bonds, Wang envisions stock prices
fluctuating according to their value on the market. He also wants to
open all companies, except those involved in national security work,
to stock purchases.
   Now many ``stock'' companies their stocks sell to only their
workers or to other enterprises.
   ``Our economy isn't developing the way it should because there's
no self-interest,'' Wang said. ``The most active part are the
individual businessmen. We must study them and the stock system is
one way to do it.''
   But Zhang, one of the proposers, and others are pessimistic about
the proposals.
   ``The problem is that the people who we need to help us are the
ones who are going to be hurt the most by the proposals,'' he said.
``We are asking them to give up their fat salaries and government
cars. It won't be easy.''
   Hua and his colleagues recently sent Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang a proposal. Wang and several of his backers have met with
Politburo member Yao Yilin.
   Hua's proposal has been published in several issues of the
publication Economic Research and a book is soon to be published.
Hardly a day goes by when stocks and a stock market are not
discussed in the state-run press.
   State Council spokesman Yuan Wu, at a recent news conference,
acknowledged that many new economic theories were being debated.
   ``We encourage this,'' he said. But, he added, ``the system of
public ownership will be primary in China.''
   Hua and the others say he's got it wrong.
   ``There's no way it can last,'' Hua said. ``Sooner or later, they
will recognize the truth.''

<HEAD>Purdy's Road To Infamy: Violent Homecoming Ends Years Of Drifting</HEAD>

   If there was one constant in Patrick
Edward Purdy's short and troubled life, it was his itch to be
somewhere else.
   He started roaming early, at age 14 running from an unhappy home,
and he seldom stopped over the past 10 years. But the demons chasing
Purdy finally caught up with him last Tuesday as he ended his
transient life in a violent homecoming at his old elementary school
here.
   Purdy, 24, opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle on a crowded
playground. He killed five children and wounded 29 other youngsters
and a teacher. Then he turned a pistol on himself and delivered a
final, fatal shot.
   As residents of this central California town reeled in horror,
people who knew Patrick Purdy struggled to understand how the
troubled young drifter could have turned into a murderous commando.
   Despite the public nature of his schoolyard slaughter, Purdy held
a rage as private as it was explosive. He knew how to build walls
around his emotions, sometimes shielding a darker nature from those
who thought they knew him well.
   Where his aunt and uncle saw a polite young man working hard to
overcome some bad breaks, others saw a surly loner who plunged into
suicidal moods, tormented by alcohol, drugs, and a world he believed
had done him wrong.
   Some former co-workers remember a hard worker who kept to himself
and harmed nobody, and relatives say Purdy was well-read and
articulate. But others knew Purdy as the high school drop-out
described in one police report as dangerous and suffering from
``mild mental retardation.''
   Some saw him when he was down and out, with a scraggly beard and
ragged clothes. Others saw a clean-shaven, handsome man with short
blond hair, tanned face and piercing blue eyes.
   Nobody saw him for long.
   Purdy crisscrossed the country, living and working in Stockton,
Los Angeles, Florida, Tennessee, Connecticut, and Texas, among other
places. He hitchhiked, or drove beat-up old cars, sometimes
abandoning them when they broke down.
   ``He was always on the go. He couldn't keep still,'' said his
aunt, Julie Michael.
   His transient ways began long before he had a choice in the
matter.
   Patrick Edward Purdy was the son of an Army man, Patrick Benjamin
Purdy, born while the elder Purdy was stationed at Fort Lewis near
Seattle. The parents split within a few years, and Purdy stayed with
his mother, Kathy, who took him to South Lake Tahoe, Calif.
   They also apparently lived for a while in Stockton. School
records show that Purdy attended kindergarten through third grade at
Cleveland Elementary School, scene of last week's slaughter.
   Purdy had a stormy relationship with his mother, who remarried
twice after divorcing Purdy's father. She is believed to be living
in Sacramento but could not be located.
   By the age of 14, Purdy had a serious drinking problem, and he
either left or was kicked out after the fights with his mother
became too intense and frequent.
   His father was killed in a traffic accident in September 1981,
but Purdy didn't know for three months because he was on the road,
his aunt said.
   By then, he was in Los Angeles, where he was making himself known
to police under the alias Eddie West.
   Between 1980 and '83, he racked up a number of arrests on charges
including marijuana possession, robbery, prostitution and receiving
stolen property. None of the offenses involved extensive jail time,
and police say Purdy did not stand out among the thousands of young
toughs they see each year.
   1984 found him in Key West, Fla., where he worked first for a
nursery and then for a construction company. Workers there remember
him for his strange talk of UFOs, but they say he was clean-cut and
a good worker.
   ``He was a very lone wolf,'' said Richard McCarthy, his boss at
the nursery. ``You used to see him sitting in the bar alone, in the
darkest corner, and he wouldn't talk to anyone.''
   Purdy quit in April 1985 and drifted back to the West Coast,
dropping in occasionally to visit and pick up mail at his
grandmother's house in Lodi, 15 miles north of Stockton. He joined
the family for Christmas that year.
   But for most holidays, he was on the road. It was a world of few
friends, of living hand to mouth. He told his aunt stories of living
outside by a river in Stockton, heating up water in soda bottles to
wash himself.
   One of the few people he allowed close to him was his
half-brother, Albert Gulart Jr. In April 1987, he and Gulart were
arrested for using a semi-automatic pistol to shoot at trees during
a drunken spree near Lake Tahoe.
   Resisting arrest, Purdy yelled it was his duty ``to help the
suppressed and to overthrow the suppressor.'' Later, in his cell, he
tried to hang himself with a knotted shirt, then slashed his wrists
and wrote on the walls with blood.
   A mental health report concluded he was dangerous and suffering
from drug abuse and mild mental retardation.
   But there were signs that Purdy was trying to change his life's
downward spin. Late in 1987, he started welding classes at a
community college in Stockton. And last January, he started work at
a Stockton machine shop, where his dour silence earned him the
nickname ``Smiley.''
   He was befriended by Kelley Riley, 25, sister of the woman who
managed the Stockton hotel where Purdy lived.
   Riley remembers him as non-violent but prone to alcoholic binges
and bouts of suicidal depression. Purdy trusted her enough to share
his dreams of the perfect girl _ ``a nice, pretty one with money,''
Riley said. But he couldn't play cards with her, constantly
insisting that she was cheating.

   The rate of increase in consumer prices held at
4.4 percent in 1988, a government report says, but economists are
warning inflation could accelerate moderately this year.
   Although the rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index
last year was identical to the 1987 gain, the reasons were very

<HEAD>Inflation Steady; Housing Starts Down; Markets Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The latest government economic reports show 1988 inflation
steadied and the housing industry slumped, but private analysts
foresee higher prices this year and claim the homebuilding business
remains healthy.
   None of the news Thursday influenced the financial markets,
however. Stocks finished slightly higher and continued nearing
pre-crash levels; the dollar weakened because of aggressive selling
by central banks; and bonds were mixed.
   The Labor Department said the rate of increase in consumer prices
last year totaled 4.4 percent, matching the 1987 gain.
   The summer drought inflated food prices by 5.2 percent in 1988,
vs. a 3.5 percent a year earlier. But consumers got a break on
energy costs, which rose 0.5 percent vs. 8.2 percent in 1987.
   Excluding food and energy categories, inflation did accelerate,
from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 4.7 percent in 1988. Many economists
contend this measurement is more accurate because food and energy
costs fluctuate sharply.
   ``The core inflation is ticking up,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, an
economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. in
Chicago. ``I would not treat last year's number as something very
calming.''
   Nevertheless, 1988 ended on a moderate note, with 0.3 percent
increases in both November and December.
   In another report, the Commerce Department said housing
construction dropped 8.2 percent in 1988 to its lowest level in six
years.
   Construction of single-family homes and apartments fell during
1988 to leave total housing starts at 1.49 million units. It was the
poorest showing since the recession year of 1982 when 1.06 million
units were built.
   But private analysts said despite the decline, which is likely to
continue into the current year, 1988 was a good year for the housing
industry because the level of construction remained relatively high.
   On Wall Street, stock traders paid little attention to either
report, focusing instead on a generally improving investment
atmosphere, exactly 15 months after the unprecedented market crash.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues rose 0.36 to 2,239.11
after picking up 24.11 on Wednesday.
   The widely followed barometer had a session high of 2,254.64 _
the first time it has surpassed the level where it stood before the
crash. On Oct. 16, 1987, the last trading day before the crash, the
average closed at 2,246.74.
   The story was different in foreign exchange, where central banks
slammed the dollar lower, cooling a rally that had brought the U.S.
currency to its highest levels since early October.
   The behavior of the dollar and stocks had little effect on the
bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates and the
economy. Government Treasury bonds fell slightly while corporates
and municipals rose.

   Oil futures prices ended mixed as traders decided
to take profits following Wednesday's strong rally.
   The market had started out on a strong note Thursday, but
analysts said widespread profit-taking depresed prices of refined
petroleum products and erased most of the gains in crude oil on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``We've seen such strong gains throughout the recent week that
the market had to stand back and take a little stock today,'' said
James Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc.
   He said that most traders remained Thursday bullish about the
market's outlook amid continued optimism that the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will abide by a
production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1.
   A recent OPEC production report showed that daily output among
cartel members averaged 19 million this month, about half a million
barrels higher than the agreed-upon quota but down 4 million barrels
from December.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, closed up 2 cents to $19.28 a barrel on the
mercantile exchange Thursday, after hitting a high of $19.45 during
the session. The contract had risen 31 cents on Wednesday, reaching
a 14-month high.
   Among refined contracts, February home heating oil settled 0.86
cent lower to 53.75 cents a gallon, after rising 1.56 cents
Wednesday.
   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which jumped 1.16
cents in Wednesday's session, settled at 52.10 cents a gallon, down
0.16 cent.

   General Electric Co. says the decision to replace
the chief executive at Kidder, Peabody Group with one of its most
highly-regarded executives underscores GE's commitment to the Wall
Street securities firm it acquired in 1986.
   On Thursday, Michael A. Carpenter, an executive vice president of
GE Capital, part of GE Financial Services, was named president and
chief executive officer of Kidder, Peabody Group.
   Silas S. Cathcart, a former GE director brought in as an interim
chief executive in 1987, will stay on as chairman of Kidder.
   Max C. Chapman Jr., a longtime Kidder employee who had been
running the group from his position as president of Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co., the broker-dealer unit, resigned to pursue other interests,
according to a statement from GE Financial Services.
   Lawrence A. Bossidy, vice chairman and chief executive officer of
the financial services unit, said Carpenter's appointment ``is an
expression of GE's continued support and investment in the future of
Kidder.''
   Analysts say installation of new Kidder leadership reflects the
corporate parent's desire to exert greater control over Kidder's
day-to-day operations, as well as GE's latest attempt to deal with
difficulties posed by the firm.
   While at GE Capital, Carpenter built a reputation as a savvy
manager able to work well within GE's corporate structure.
   Carpenter also will retain responsibility for the corporate
finance group of GE Capital, which specializes in developing
financing packages for leveraged buy-outs. He will continue
reporting to Wendt.
   Once the oldest privately-held firm on Wall Street, Kidder sold
an 80 percent stake in itself to GE in April 1986, boosting Kidder's
capital base and enabling it to compete more effectively with larger
rivals.
   The 124-year-old firm suffered a major blow to its reputation
when it became embroiled in the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal.
Kidder agreed in 1987 to pay a then-record $25.3 million settle
civil charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The episode also prompted GE to make aggressive management
changes at the firm in response to what it perceived as management
weaknesses to led to Kidder's involvement in the scandal.
   The management shakeups at Kidder are seen by many as
highlighting the problems that can occur when smokestack companies
try to bring new types of business into their corporate fold, as has
happened frequently this decade.
   GE management generally has gotten excellent marks for the
handling of its expansion into financial services. But analysts say
some clashes are inevitable even in the most carefully handled
situations.
   While Wall Streeters pride themselves on an entreprenuerial
spirit, they often are criticized for following a strategy that
focuses on short-term rewards at the expense of long-term planning.
   ``It's tough for industrial companies to own Wall Street
financial firms. They drive the creative people out. Creative people
feel limited, suffocated,'' said one analyst, who asked not to be
named. ``It's not like running an insurance company or a bank.''
   Earlier this week, two senior members of Kidder's merchant
banking group announced their departures.
   But in response to recent reports indicating GE may be sorry it
bought Kidder, Bossidy declared GE was not disappointed with
Kidder's 1988 results. He said Kidder's operating net income came to
nearly $50 million in 1988, up about 20 percent over 1987.
   On Thursday, GE reported its net income rose to $1.01 billion in
the fourth quarter, the first time quarterly earnings have exceeded
$1 billion. For all of 1988, GE earned $3.39 billion after taxes, up
16 percent from $2.92 bllion in 1987. The earnings benefited from a
strong showing by GE Financial Services, the largest single GE
business.
   Bossidy also emphatically denied reports that disenchantment with
the profitability of the securities business could induce GE to sell
off Kidder's retail business, which could lead to the dismissal of
2,000 employees.
   Kidder underwent a major restructuring beginning in the wake of
the October 1987 stock market crash _ as did most major Wall Streete
firms _ to consolidate and reduce costs.

<HEAD>Potential Bid For GEC Is Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new company formed to launch a bid for General
Electric Co. PLC said it was dropping the attempt, which would have
been Britain's largest ever takeover.
   However, Metsun Ltd., in its announcement Thursday, left open the
possibility of launching a future bid for the giant British
electronics company.
   The decision follows several recent ``significant events,''
including last Friday's announcement of a major joint venture
between GEC and its unrelated U.S. counterpart, General Electric
Co., Metsun said.
   ``Metsun continues to believe that a new direction is needed at
GEC in order to enhance shareholder value,'' the company said in a
brief statement. ``It doesn't consider that GEC will achieve this by
placing a substantial proportion of its business in a series of
joint ventures over which GEC and its shareholders mightn't exercise
complete control.''
   Metsun announced earlier this month that it had been formed to
put together an international consortium which might or might not
bid for GEC.
   Plessey Co., another British elecronics company which is the
target of a joint takeover attempt by GEC and West Germany's Siemens
AG, had been expected to join a consortium bid for GEC.
   Such participation would have been what Wall Street calls the Pac
Man defense because of its similarity with the eat-or-be-eaten video
game.
   Metsun said Lazard Brothers and Co., a merchant banker for both
Metsun and Plessey, had arranged talks with several international
companies, including GE, American Telephone and Telegraph Co. and
France's Thomson SA, in an effort to form a consortium to make an
expected bid for GEC of between 6.5 billion and 8 billion pounds.
That would be equivalent to around $11 billion to $14.1 billion.
   Metsun also announced that ``in view of the potential conflict''
of Lazard Brothers being adviser to both Plessey and Metsun, the
company had decided to replace Lazard with Baring Brothers and Co.
Ltd.
   The decision to drop the GEC takeover came on Baring Brothers'
advice and Lazard agreed with it, Metsun said.
   The potential bid ran into trouble last Thursday, when the
British government said it would conduct a three-month investigation
into the GEC-Siemens 1.7 billion pound ($3 billion) bid for Plessey.
The move likely would obstruct any bid for GEC by Metsun until the
investigation's conclusion in early April.
   Last Friday GE, another party seen as central to Metsun's plans,
announced its joint venture with GEC.
   GE will pay GEC 325 million pounds ($572 million) under the
agreement, in which the two electronics giants will merge their
European consumer products, medical equipment and some of their
electrical divisions.
   The GE-GEC venture, the government investigation and Plessey's
defensive strategies make it ``really quite impossible to go ahead''
with a bid at this point, said a Metsun spokesman, who wasn't
identified in accordance with British practice.

<HEAD>Proxy Fight Promised As Shamrock Boosts Offer For Polaroid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saying they would wage a proxy fight for control of
the instant photography giant, officials at Shamrock Holdings Inc.
have sweetened their bid for Polaroid Corp. to $3.2 billion.
   Shamrock said Thursday it would pay $45 a share for all Polaroid
stock, including 9.7 million shares recently issued to Polaroid's
employee stock ownership plan. The previous tender offer of $42 a
share did not apply to the ESOP shares.
   Shamrock, a television and radio company owned by the Roy E.
Disney family and based in Burbank, Calif., also indicated it would
nominate a slate of candidates for election to Polaroid's board of
directors at the company's May 9 annual meeting.
   If Polaroid shareholders vote to elect them, Shamrock's
candidates would be committed to selling the company either under
Shamrock's offer or to any third party that made a bona fide, higher
offer, said Stanley P. Gold, Shamrock's president and chief
executive.
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said the company's board
would meet to review Shamrock's revised offer and make a
recommendation to shareholders. But she said the date of the board
meeting had not been set.
   Polaroid jumped $3.12{ a share to $39.87{ Thursday in active New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   After a court decision two weeks ago upheld Polaroid's employee
stock ownership plan, some securities analysts had predicted that
Shamrock would have to abandon its takeover attempt. But the
$45-a-share offer was seen on Wall Street as a strong indication
that the fight will go on.
   ``This definitely raises Shamrock's credibility,'' said Alex
Henderson of Prudential Bache &amp; Co. ``But I doubt very seriously
that Polaroid is just going to roll over and play dead. I don't
think Shamrock is going to be able to take them over without winning
control of the board.''
   Shamrock also announced that about 13.1 million Polaroid shares,
or 18.3 percent of the outstanding stock, had been tendered to
Shamrock and not withdrawn as of the close of business Wednesday.
   Shamrock is fighting in court to try to invalidate the ESOP,
which it argues was designed specifically to forestall a takeover.
   A Delaware Chancery Court judge upheld the ESOP on Jan. 6, and
Shamrock has filed an appeal with the Delaware Supreme Court. Oral
arguments are scheduled for March. Shamrock said Thursday that if
the ESOP is invalidated, it would raise its offer to $47 a share, or
about $3.36 billion.
   Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., has been resisting Shamrock
since July, when the California company made a friendly but
unsolicited offer of $40 a share.
   Shamrock launched its initial hostile offer of $42 a share in
September. Last month, more than 5,000 of Polaroid's 8,300 employees
signed a petition saying they had ``no comfort or confidence'' that
a takeover would benefit the company.
   Shamrock said its tender offer expires March 15 and is contingent
on obtaining at least 90 percent of Polaroid's 71.6 million
outstanding shares.
   The suitor said it would finance the revised offer with its own
equity, about $1.4 billion from a high-yield ``junk bond'' offering
placed by the investment firms Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., and $1.6 billion from banks, mainly Wells
Fargo Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia.

   The dollar firmed against most major currencies in
European trading this morning, after the West German central bank
intervened to end an early upward trend.
   Gold prices rose in lackluster trading.
   The dollar opened the European session at about 1.8460 Deutsche
marks, then moved up to 1.8510 before the Bundesbank intervention
forced it back to 1.8440.
   Dealers said the Bundesbank intervention, although light and not
followed by an other central banks, was enough to reverse the firmer
trend early today.
   The central banks ``have made it clear that they don't want the
dollar to rise,'' one trader said in Rome.
   In London, the dollar drifted higher against the British pound.
It cost $1.7610 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7615 late
Thursday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.5708 Swiss francs, down from 1.5805;
6.3000 French francs, down from 6.3315; 2.0915 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.1060; 1,353.0 Italian lire, down from 1,368.50; 1.1860
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1873.
   In Tokyo, the dollar was sharply lower, closing at 128.05, down
1.15 from Thursday's close. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted
at 128.35 yen.
   At the mid-morning fixing in London, spot gold was $404.50, down
slightly from $404.75 in Hong Kong, but up from late Thursday quotes
of $403.50 in New York and $402.50 in London.
   Dealers said trading was lackluster, and said gold had been
hovering around the $405 level all morning. One dealer said gold
faced strong technical resistance at the $405 to $407 level.
   Dealers said gold was boosted today by short covering that
followed a decline in the dollar in overnight trading, which was
helped by the Bundesbank's intervention.
   In Zurich, gold opened at a bid of $404.50, up from $403.40 on
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $406.09, up $2.26 from
Thursday.
   Silver bullion gained on the London market to a bid price of
$6.03 a troy ounce, up from $5.97 late Thursday.

   The U.S. dollar finished sharply lower against the
Japanese yen today, while share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock

intervention on overseas markets, traders said.
   The dollar finished at 128.05 yen, down 1.15 yen from Thursday's

of anonymity.
   But the dollar's downward move is likely to be a temporary trend,
he added.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a press conference today
that currency rates ``didn't move much,'' and have already returned
to their level before the joint intervention.
   But Murayama hinted the United States could move to raise its own
interest rates due to inflation worries.
   Other dealers said trading was not active ahead of
President-elect Bush's inauguration speech later today, as investors
were concerned Bush might indicate a new monetary policy.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 43.15 points the
previous day, lost another 141.02 points, or 0.45 percent, to fall
further to 31,170.37. The index, which lost 233.16 points at the end
of the morning trading, could not erase the loss although it started
to recover during the afternoon session.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billion
shares.
   Following a 0.5 percentage-point interest rate hike in several
European nations including West Germany, Switzerland and France, the
index quickly plunged as investors moved to the sidelines or sold
for profit- taking, said a Nikko Securities dealer.
   ``Now investors are mainly concerned how the U.S. monetary
authorities would react. But the majority think that the U.S.
central bank would maintain current discount rates even if it raises
the prime lending rate,'' the dealer said.

   Dick Lyng says he might sleep a bit longer this
weekend and will take it a lot easier from here on.
   Lyng, 70, probably won't fade completely into the woodwork after
his hitch as Ronald Reagan's secretary of agriculture ends today. He
plans to continue living in the Washington area and says he ``may
lend a hand'' if the right cause comes along.
   Clayton Yeutter, 58, is George Bush's choice as secretary of
agriculture, and Yeutter doesn't like to sleep late any time. He's a
supercharged law and economics graduate from Eustis, Neb., who's
expected to call a lively Bush tune at the Agriculture Department.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee said Thursday that Yeutter's
confirmation hearing may be the latter part of next week, possible
on Thursday or Friday.
   Yeutter enjoys popular support among many farm groups and members
of Congress after serving 3{ years as the U.S. trade representative,
the No. 1 negotiator on agricultural and other trade issues. And
he's not expected to run into much trouble in his Senate
confirmation proceeding.
   But committee members will want to know from Yeutter how he
thinks George Bush will be kinder and gentler to American farmers.
They will want to know how Bush intends to do this without spending
more money and without driving more hard-pressed farmers into
foreclosure.
   The Senate panel may seek more information from Yeutter on
agricultural trade negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, and how the impasse with the European Economic
Community over the use of meat hormones can be unsnarled.
   One of the major issues facing Yeutter will be legislation to
replace, modify or extend the 1985 farm law, which will expire in
1990 after its five-year run.
   What about the level of price and income supports available to
farmers under various USDA commodity programs?
   The 1985 law significantly reduced price supports and enabled the
Reagan administration to take giant steps nearer the
``market-oriented'' system of U.S. agriculture that many had sought.
Lyng was a strong advocate of this line, and so is Yeutter.
   Much of the time lately, the action has involved international
trade, including the U.S. proposal to GATT for a phasing out of all
subsidies and barriers that interfere with free world commerce. The
furor of the European ban on hormone-treated meat is an example.
   Yeutter and Lyng were a strong team, with both talking tough and
showing muscle to the doubtful Europeans, prompting EEC officials to
speak of ``Rambo-style diplomacy'' on the part of the insistent
Americans.
   With Lyng departed, the Senate could want to know what kind of
role Yeutter will play in the continuing trade negotiations and
whether Bush and his choice for U.S. trade representative, Carla
Hills, will keep standing tall on behalf of American farmers.
   If these aren't enough question materials, the senators only have
to dust off copies of Reagan's final budget proposals for fiscal
1990 and ask Yeutter about:
   _Lopping $9.7 billion off USDA's spending in the year that will
begin on Oct. 1, including cuts in commodity programs and rural
development.
   _Barring subsidized school lunches to children from affluent
homes, thereby requiring them to pay 26 cents more per meal.
   _Helping pay for fighting fires in national forests through
deductions from each state's share of proceeds from timber sales and
mining.
   _The concept of ``decoupling'' as a way of paying subsidies to
farmers without linking the payments to kind of crops they produce.
The payments would be reduced gradually over a period of years and
could then be phased out entirely.

   The Agriculture Department says turkey output
is not expanding as rapidly this year and that prices will be higher.
   Production is expected to increase about 3 percent to an
estimated 4.05 billion pounds from about 3.033 billion pounds in
1988. That would be only half the 6 percent increase in turkey meat
output from 1987 to 1988, the department's Economic Research Service
said.
   ``Turkey producers are slowing their rate of increase after two
years of lackluster returns,'' the agency said. ``Wholesale hen
turkey prices in the eastern region averaged 61 cents per pound in
1988 and are expected to average 63 to 69 cents in 1989.''
   Another report, which was issued by the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board, said that surveys of turkey growers in 20 major
producing states intend to boost the number of birds _ not in pounds
_ by 7 percent from last year.
   The report said U.S. turkey production in 1988 totaled more than
242 million birds, up 1 percent from about 240.4 million in 1987.
   North Carolina was first last year with 47.9 million turkeys,
followed by Minnesota, 38.5 million; California, 26.5 million;
Arkansas, 18 million; Missouri, 16.5 million; and Virginia, 16.3
million.

   A new rule allowing the separation, or
uncoupling, of beef quality and beef yield grades has been approved
and will take effect April 9, the Agriculture Department said.
   J. Patrick Boyle, head of the department's Agricultural Marketing
Service, said Thursday the change was in response to a petition
filed in June 1987 by the American Meat Institute and the National
Cattlemen's Association.
   ``The rule allows the beef industry to determine whether to have
carcasses graded by USDA for quality, or for yield, or both,'' Boyle
said. ``Previously, a carcass had to be grade both for quality and
yield, or not graded at all.''
   Meat grading is a voluntary program offered by the agency and is
paid for by user fees.
   Boyle said the trade associations asked for the rule changes ``in
order to utilize new, more efficient technologies now available for
preparing beef carcasses, one of which is hot-fat trimming just
after slaughter'' instead of trimming after the carcasses are
chilled, as is the current practice.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move to spin off its holding in an
unprofitable cellular telephone business, Affiliated Publications
Inc., publisher of The Boston Globe and Billboard magazine, has
announced a major restructuring.
   Separately, British Telecommunications PLC announced in London
that it had agreed to pay roughly $1.5 billion for a 22 percent
stake in the cellular business, McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.
of Kirkland, Wash.
   Affiliated owns about 43 percent of McCaw, which is the largest
cellular telephone operator in the United States and which has
suffered losses in recent years during the start-up phase of its
operations.
   Wall Street analysts said the restructuring, announced Thursday,
would benefit Affiliated by separating its profitable publishing
operations from the troubled cellular business, which has dragged
down its stock price. But they also called the British Telecom
investment a strong expression of faith in the future of the
cellular operations.
   John Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said
British Telecom's investment values McCaw at about $140 per ``pop,''
an industry term for each person residing in the company's cellular
franchise area.
   ``Most of the cellular companies were selling in the high 80s or
90s per pop,'' Reidy said. ``This is a very smart investor saying
it's willing to pay $140. We view that as a tremendous endorsement
of the U.S. cellular industry.''
   Under the restructuring, which requires approval from
shareholders and federal regulators, Boston-based Affiliated would
split into two parts.
   The Globe and Billboard businesses would become a new entity,
Globe@Billboard Holding Co., held by Affiliated's current
stockholders. Reidy said Globe@Billboard stock would probably sell
for $13 to $14 and earn about 90 cents a share this year.
   Affiliated stockholders would also receive 0.84 of a share of
McCaw for each share of Affiliated they hold. Following the spinoff,
McCaw would issue 37 million new shares of stock and sell them to
British Telecom for $41.50 a share, or $1.53 billion.
   Affiliated stock rose $2[ a share to $40] in composite trading
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. McCaw jumped $5.50 to close
at $34.50 a share. The prices of many other cellular issues also
rose in reaction to the British Telecom announcement.
   ``Under this plan, Affiliated will be able to focus its attention
on its core publishing and media businesses while McCaw continues to
concentrate on building its personal communications business,''
William O. Taylor, Affiliated's chairman, said in a news release.
   British Telecom, which already owns cellular telephone interests
in Britain, said the move anticipates the ``globalization of
telecommunications markets.''
   It also strengthens the company's peripheral businesses at a time
of an expected slowdown in regulated telecommunications markets in
Britain, according to British Telecom Chairman Iain Vallance.
   The British telecommunications giant holds 60 percent of Cellnet,
one of two licensed cellular telephone operators in Britain.
   ``Our investment in McCaw is seen by both sides as a real
operating partnership, not just a financial arrangement,'' Vallance
said.
   Affiliated posted a loss of $26.52 million in the first nine
months of 1988, including a $37.2 million loss from its share of
McCaw Cellular.
   McCaw posted a net loss of $204.8 million in the nine months and
had an operating loss of $44.6 million in the same period a year
earlier. The company has indicated the losses were consistent with
its expectations of the cost of the startup phase of its cellular
operations.
   British Telecom will obtain a mixture of McCaw class A and B
shares, giving it a total of 22 percent of the enlarged share
capital, as well as 22 percent voting power.
   The A shares, carrying one vote each, are traded over the
counter. The B shares carry 10 votes each.
   After the restructuring, the board of 19 McCaw directors would
consist of four members appointed by British Telecom, 10 appointed
by the McCaw family, two by Affiliated Publications and three
independent directors.

   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel took steps
in his last day on the job to boost the nation's oil production by
granting new benefits to oil companies.
   Following reports this week of slumping U.S. oil production,
Hodel on Thursday lowered the rates oil companies pay to drill on
leased federal land and recommended the vast Alaska wildlife refuge
be opened to oil exploration.
   Decreasing the leasing fees for millions of acres in the West
could cost taxpayers an estimated $35 million annually, said Marta
Witt, a spokeswoman for the department's Bureau of Land Management.
   The move, published Thursday in the Federal Register and
scheduled to take effect March 1, will lower leasing rates that now
range from $2 to $3 down to $1 per acre on leases issued before
1987. Later leases carry a different schedule of fees.
   ``This action is consistent with other steps the department has
taken over the past two years when oil prices bottomed out and U.S.
production began to dwindle to the point of serious concerns, to the
point of even national security impact,'' said Timothy Locke, a
spokesman for BLM.
   According to Witt, about 70 million acres of federal land in
several Western states are currently leased to oil exploration
firms, about half what was under lease six years ago. About half
those lands are already leased for $1 per acre, she said.
   ``We hope this decreases the holding costs for these existing
leases,'' said Witt. ``We don't envision this (leased) acreage being
increased so much as we hope that what is already leased remains in
the hands of companies longer and the savings are used to develop
the land.''
   In the second move, Hodel recommended that Congress allow native
Alaska corporations to trade ownership of land they hold for mineral
rights to thousands of acres in the federal Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge and other refuges in Alaska, Interior Department spokesman
Tom Wilson said.
   The right to allow such exchanges rests with Congress. Congress
last year received a report from the General Accounting Office that
trades the department wanted to make vastly overstated the value of
the land the government was to receive.
   The federal land would remain U.S. government property, with the
Indian, Eskimo and Aleut corporations taking over rights to what oil
analysts project as massive oil deposits, possibly as large as the
huge Prudhoe Bay field 65 to 100 miles to the West.
   Environmentalists have opposed Reagan administration moves to
allow oil exploration of the refuge. Wilson said Hodel's
recommendation came after the department completed a two-year
environmental impact statement.
   The American Petroleum Institute announced Wednesday that U.S.
imports jumped 9 percent in 1988 to the highest levels in nine
years. At the same time, API reported that domestic oil production
sagged to a 12-year low of 8.1 million barrels a day last year, down
3 percent from 1987.
   ``The actions this week are a reaction to the same kind of
statistics we've been seeing that show problems in American
production,'' said Witt.
   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department on Thursday proposed new
rules that will give the agency a say in the leasing of national
forest land to oil and gas developers. Leasing authority has been
held exclusively by the BLM, but legislation in 1987 expanded the
authority of the secretary of Agriculture.

<HEAD>Tyson Increases Bid For Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGDALE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tyson Foods, attempting to strengthen its
position as the nation's top poultry processor, raised its bid for
Holly Farms to $63.50 a share, or $1.15 billion, as the Holly Farms
board of directors was meeting to decide the company's fate.
   Late Thursday, Holly Farms said in a news release from its
corporate headquarters in Memphis, Tenn., that the board was still
considering the increased bid from Tyson. Tyson's previous bid had
been $60 a share.
   Holly Farms, the giant chicken processor, is the subject of a
bidding war between two of the nation's largest chicken producers.
   ConAgra, the Omaha, Neb.,-based food conglomerate Holly Farms
sought to acquire the company, has offered a stock swap worth about
$59.25 a share, or $1.07 billion, for the company.
   Tyson successfully sued in Delaware state court to block Holly
Farms' proposed merger with ConAgra.
   The release from Holly Farms said the board, meeting in New York,
``has not reached a conclusion with respect to the Tyson proposal
and there could be no assurance that the board's deliberation would
result in a recommendation of the Tyson proposal.''
   Holly Farms also noted in the release that ``ConAgra had thus far
declined to increase its bid for Holly Farms.''
   A Tyson spokesman said he thought the prospects for his company
acquiring Holly Farms looked good.
   ``We're hopeful and optimistic that some agreement will be made''
by today, said Bob Justice from Tyson's Springdale office.
``Hopefully, in our favor.''
   An industry analyst said he had learned that Holly Farms had
nearly agreed at one point Thursday to the new Tyson offer, but then
reconsidered.
   ``They had pretty much come to the conclusion earlier today that
Tyson would be their new owner,'' said David Aney, editor of Broiler
Industry Magazine and an industry observer for 12 years, the
Arkansas Democrat newspaper in Little Rock reported today. ``But as
the lawyers and the legal people sat down to hash out the
ramifications, it became more and more difficult to come together.
They finally pulled back from the table and are exploring other
avenues right now.
   ``I think it's still very much up in the air,'' he said.
   ConAgra spokesman Walt Casey generally declined comment on the
statement in the Holly Farms release about ConAgra.
   ``We had hoped, really expected, that there might be some sort of
announcement sometime today,'' Casey said.
   He said ConAgra is still ``more than interested'' in acquiring
Holly Farms. ``We have a merger agreement with Holly Farms,'' he
said. ``That has not evaporated.''
   Tyson's stock closed at $15.50 a share Thursday, down 25 cents,
in trading of 368,000 shares, more than normal. Holly Farms closed
at $62.37, up 75 cents, with 540,000 shares traded. ConAgra closed
at $30.75, up 50 cents, in trading of 169,000 shares.
   The Holly Farms board of directors began meeting Wednesday to
consider final offers from Tyson and ConAGra.
   Last fall, Tyson offered to buy Holly Farms for $52 a share _ a
friendly offer worth about $900 million.
   If ConAgra wins the right to acquire Holly Farms, the new company
would be the nation's top chicken processor. Tyson has 14.1 percent
of the market while ConAgra is second with 9.5 percent and Holly
Farms has 6.6 percent.
   If Holly Farms' board recommends a sale to ConAgra, a food
conglomerate, and shareholders go along with that recommendation,
Holly Farms executives have said the Holly Farms operation would be
largely independent.
   If the Holly Farms board recommends that shareholders sell their
stock to Tyson Foods, and the shareholders follow that advice, Holly
Farms will become part of the poultry empire founded by Don Tyson.

   Texaco was fined $750,000 and a former
employee was placed on three years probation after pleading guilty
to charges of falsifying a critical safety test for an offshore oil
platform.
   Texaco had agreed to plead guilty to charges brought under the
federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act that Bobby R. Brogdin, 48,
decided not to test a blowout preventer on Platform Harvest, 11
miles off the Santa Barbara coast.
   Brogdin was unable to find the necessary tool to remove a part so
the test could be conducted, according to a memorandum filed in
federal court.
   Later, Brogdin allegedly instructed workers with the Heimerich
and Payne International Drilling Co. to falsify the test so that
Texaco would not be fined for failing to conduct the blowout test.
   While noting that Brogdin, a Bakersfield resident, was a
``decent, hard-working, caring person,'' U.S. District Judge David
Kenyon said Thursday, ``If this thing had gone, it could have blown
everyone to kingdom come.''
   In addition to placing Brogdin on three years probation, Kenyon
fined him $5,000, noting Brogdin already had paid a high price in
losing his job.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Janet Goldstein wrote in a sentencing
memorandum that an investigation into the incident revealed other
shortcomings in certain testing procedures during late 1986.
   ``The investigation has revealed that Texaco's general practices
and procedures in conducting (tests) in these early months left much
to be desired from a safety and environmental perspective,''
Goldstein wrote.
   Texaco attorney Keate Worley disputed the claims of lax
procedures in the report.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors will seek more than $1
million in fines against Rockwell International Corp., which pleaded
guilty to criminal charges stemming from double billing on an Air
Force satellite contract.
   As part of an agreement with the prosecutors, the company entered
a conditional guilty plea Thursday in U.S. District Court to one
count of conspiracy and one count of contempt of court stemming from
about $450,000 in overcharges in 1983.
   The conditional plea means that if Rockwell successfully appeals
an early ruling in the case its plea will be stricken.
   U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner said his office would seek a fine of
``well in excess'' of $1 million.
   Rockwell, the El Segundo, Calif., company that made the B-1B
bomber and space shuttle, among other government and private
projects, originally was charged with seven counts of conspiracy,
mail fraud and contempt.
   The company was accused of overcharging the Air Force for work on
one of a series of Navstar Global Positioning Satellites, which are
used by military and civilian navigators to pinpoint their position.
The government alleged Rockwell's satellite systems division in Seal
Beach, Calif., billed the Air Force for the same work under two
contracts.
   The contempt charge was filed because in a civil settlement that
ended an earlier investigation of alleged false billing for labor
charges on the space shuttle, Rockwell promised to refrain from
fraudulent billing.
   The conspiracy count carries a maximum fine of $500,000. The
judge has unlimited authority to impose fines for contempt.
Sentencing was set for Feb. 24.
   Rockwell's attorney, James Neal, repeated the company's
contention that the double billing was planned by employees without
the knowledge or consent of upper-level executives.
   The company says it discovered the fraud and reported it to the
Pentagon under procedures established for such cases and therefore
should not have been charged in the first place.
   A defense motion to dismiss the indictment on those grounds was
rejected by U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall.
   The company plans to appeal that ruling, Neal said.
   Neal said the company behaved properly once it discovered the
double billing.
   ``We informed the government of the conduct. We fired the
employees,'' Neal said, adding that the company had offered to repay
any overcharges.
   Bonner rejected Rockwell's contention that it was absolved of
guilt by reporting the double billing to the government. Rockwell's
disclosure to the Defense Contracting Agency came 10 months after an
Air Force audit uncovered billing irregularities, Bonner told
reporters outside of court.
   The prosecution also rejected the company's contention that the
double billing amounted to wrongdoing by individuals rather than the
corporation.
   Evidence introduced at the trial of one of the employees
suggested that at least some higher Rockwell executives knew of
attempts to cover up the fraud, said Assistant U.S. Attorney George
B. Newhouse Jr.
   A Rockwell manager, Robert Zavodnik, 47, has pleaded guilty to
lying to the government and conspiracy and is awaiting sentencing.
His supervisor, Donald Carter, 60, was acquitted of the same charges
by a federal jury.

   Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 6.8 percent
in December from 6.4 percent in the previous month, with prices
rising for a wide range of products, the government said Friday.
   The Department of Employment said its retail price index was up
0.3 percent in December from the previous month.
   Market expectations had been for an annual rate of between 6.7
percent and 7 percent and a monthly rate of between 0.3 percent and
0.5 percent
   In November, the index rose 0.5 percent from the previous month.
   The index, which uses a January 1987 basis of 100, stood at 110.3
in December, up from 110 in November, and up from in 103.3 December
1987.
   The Department said the December monthly rise was the result of
higher prices for a wide range of goods and services, especially
food. The department said the prices of motor vehicles, wines and
spirits fell during December.
   The Department said excluding mortgage interest payments, retail
prices posted an annual gain of 5.1 percent in December and a
month-to-month gain of 0.2 percent.

<TEXT>
   Iberia airlines canceled 98 scheduled
domestic and international flights Friday as jet mechanics seeking
better pay and working conditions carried out their eighth 24-hour
strike in a month, a company spokesman said.
   The strike mostly affected airports in Madrid and Barcelona,
forcing cancelation of 53 flights to European capitals, the
spokesman, Jose Maria Estrade, said.
   The spokesman said the strike actions were expected to continue
into February but that the company did not intend to open
negotiations with the Spanish Association of Aircraft Maintenance
Technicians.
   Iberia, the government-owned airline, has estimated losses due to
the strikes at 3.5 billion pesetas, or $30.6 million.
   Union spokesman Ramses Rodriguez said ASETMA demands a separate
collective bargaining agreement for its 1,400 members, whose current
work and pay conditions were established in an accord covering
Iberia's 21,000 ground employees.
   The ground employees are mainly represented by Spain's two
largest unions, the Socialist-led General Workers Union and the
Communist-dominated Workers Commissions, both of which oppose the
strike as ``not only unnecessary but harmful to workers.''
   Iberia has fired 79 ASETMA mechanics and suspended 21 others
without pay since the labor dispute began in late December due to
the workers' refusal to carry out legal minimum services set by the
Transport Ministry.
   Rodriguez said the union will continue to ignore the minimum
services decree it considers ``illegal and abusive.''
   Iberia employs 2,000 aircraft mechanics, of which 1,770 are on
active rolls.

<HEAD>USDA Experts Says Soviets Still Had a Bumper Crop Last Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Western reaction to the Soviet Union's
announcement last week that 1988 crop production dropped to 195
million metric tons, down sharply from 1987 production and far below
the Kremlin's goal, was a bit overblown, says an Agriculture
Department analyst.
   Since last Nov. 9, the USDA has been estimating the 1988 Soviet
grain crop at 200 million tons, down from 211.4 million tons in 1987
and 210.1 million tons in 1986. Moscow's target was 235 million tons.
   Christian Foster, who specializes in Soviet agriculture for the
department's Economic Research Service, said the preliminary
estimate of 195 million tons announced by Stepan Sitaryan, first
deputy chairman of the state planning committee, was not too far off
base from the USDA forecast.
   But the announcement drew big headlines in the West and raised
questions about the Soviet Union's agricultural outlook.
   ``The press did make a big deal out of the Soviet number,''
Foster said in a telephone interview. ``But, in fact, the two
numbers are very, very close, and 195 million tons is not a poor
crop, by any means.''
   Foster acknowledged that 1988 grain production was far less than
the 235 million ton-target set by Moscow planners. But he said the
targets are rarely met.
   ``They're still calling for 250 million tons of grain by 1990 and
260 million to 280 million tons of grain by 1995,'' Foster said.
``These are all dreams on their part, but they continue to call for
them.''
   Foster added: ``It's nothing new that they're not meeting those
targets. At the same time, I guess it's nothing that you can just
ignore.''
   Soviet grain production often has suffered wide swings from year
to year. In 1975, for example, output dropped to 140.1 million tons
and then rebounded to 223.8 million tons in 1976. Production
remained relatively high for several years, reaching 237.4 million
tons in 1978, a record that still stands.
   But the early 1980s brought some short crops, and the five-year
average of 1981 through 1985 harvests was slightly more than 180
million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal, for example, to
36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   Foster said that 1988 production ``is still a good crop'' when
compared with the five-year average of Soviet grain output.
Moreover, he said, the average of the last three years of more than
205 tons annually is unprecedented in the Soviet Union.
   ``That's certainly not anything to sneeze at,'' Foster said.
   Another point to consider is that Moscow publishes grain
production yields on the basis of ``bunker weight,'' which is a
gross measure and doesn't take into account high moisture content,
trash and waste, he said. The USDA, to compensate, includes annual
estimates of dockage (foreign matter) and wasted grain.
   ``For instance, last year (1987) when they supposedly produced
211 million tons of grain, USDA estimated very conservatively that
30 million tons of that, or about 14 percent, couldn't even be
included,'' Foster said.
   The dockage and waste in the 1988 Soviet harvest has been
estimated at 22 million tons, he said. Thus, the year-to-year
difference in the net amount of useable grain is less than what it
appears at first glance.
   Moscow has been importing greater quantities of grain the last
couple of years, including large orders of U.S. wheat and corn under
a recently extended long-term agreement between the two countries.
   In all, the Soviet Union may import from all foreign sources a
total of 32.5 million tons in 1988-89, slightly more than in 1987-88
but still far below the 1984-85 level of 55.4 million tons,
according to a USDA report last week.
   As of mid-January, Moscow had bought 10.2 million tons of U.S.
corn, 1.3 million tons of wheat, 500,000 tons of grain sorghum,
450,000 tons of soybeans, and more than 1.1 million tons of soybean
meal for delivery in 1988-89 under terms of the long-term agreement.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to reform his
nation's agriculture through a number of innovations, including the
larger and improved use of more ``inputs'' such as fertilizer and
pesticides, and by encouraging workers on large collective and state
farms to operate under lease arrangments so they can be rewarded for
greater production.
   A meeting of the Communist Party's policy-making Central
Committee is scheduled for March to consider reforms in the farm
sector.
   Foster said it's too early to judge whether Gorbachev's program
so far has been a success or failure.
   ``If you look at the average (production) of the last three
years, it shows that something has happened since Gorbachev came
in,'' he said. ``But for the most part, I think, reform measures
haven't made a big difference yet.''
   One of the most encouraging moves, however, involves the
``intensive technology'' for Soviet agriculture, which calls for
increasing the amount of fertilizer, pesticides and other items, and
also the improved use of such materials, using them at the proper
times in the correct amounts, Foster said.

   The stock market declined slightly today, biding
its time through the change of command in Washington.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped .90 to 2,238.21
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 347 up, 552 down and
536 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.32 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market had benefited in recent weeks from
increasing expectations for George Bush's presidency.
   But by about midday on Thursday, they said, the mood among
investors began to change from anticipation to watchful waiting.
   The market's recent rally stalled when the Dow Jones industrial
average moved close to 2,250 _ about the level where it stood on
Oct. 16, 1987, just before the crash on Black Monday.
   Brokers said that could turn out to be something of a
psychological barrier for investors.
   Digital Equipment rose 1 to 105~. On Thursday the company
reported quarterly earnings that surpassed analysts' estimates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .18 to 161.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .19 at 318.75.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.36 to
2,239.11.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 5 to
4 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 814 stocks up,
643 down and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 192.03 million
shares, up from 187.54 million the previous session, and the highest
NYSE volume so far this year.

<HEAD>U.N. Official Hopes Bush MorehSympathetic to Population Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the U.N. Population agency said Friday
she hoped new U.S. President George Bush would end a three-year U.S.
Boycott of agency funding programs linked to alleged coercive
abortions in China.
   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Fund for
Population Activities, said, ``we see a new opportunity with the new
administration'' for resuming U.S. Participation in family planning
programs.
   The United States has withheld about $85 million from the UNFPA
since 1985, charging that Chinese family planning programs backed by
the UNFPA involve coercive abortions.
   ``We are not supporting any abortion program anywhere in the
world,'' Sadik said. She said Chinese officials had stressed to her
that although there are isolated cases of coercion, China does not
force women to undergo abortions.
   She said Bush was ``strongly supportive of population policies''
when he was U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in 1971-73 and should have
special sympathy for China, where he also lived in 1974-75 as head
of the U.S. Liaison office.
   Sadik, from Pakistan, said she also told the Chinese that they
should work harder to improve the image of their family planning
program, which is striving to hold down a population which has
reached 1.1 billion.
   Since 1980 China has tried to enforce a one-child per couple
policy. The policy has had some successes in the cities, but has met
resistance in the countryside where the return of family farming has
made it advantageous to have more children.
   Newly affluent farmers are also willing to pay heavy fines
imposed for giving birth to two or more children. After dipping in
the early 1980s, the rate of population growth has begun to creep up
again, and demographers now estimate the population at the end of
the century will be about 1.28 billion, well above the original
target of 1.2 billion.
   The Chinese, Dr. Sadik said, ''are not quite sure what they can
do to increase acceptance of family planning.''
   She said the stress is on more thorough education and better
clinical services.
   The UNFPA, she said, is urging China to improve the quality of
its contraceptive devices.
   Prod A. Laquian, deputy representative of the UNFPA in Beijing,
said 50 million Chinese woven wear a stainless steel intrauterine
device that is often ineffective as a contraceptive.
   He said 10 percent of women wearing the IUD become pregnant, and
that 50 to 70 percent of women who obtain abortions were usng the
faultylIUDs.
   Dr. Sadik said production of effective contraceptives will be the
top priority in a proposed 57-million-U.S. dollar UNFPA aid program
for China in the 1990-94 period. Funding will also go to maternal
and child health, information and publicity for family planning,
demographic training and programs for women.
   She said the program will be presented to the UNFPA Governing
Council in June, at which time the United States, a member of the
council, will have to take a stand. ``My hope is that the United
States and China don't want a confrontation.''
   The UNFPA will have a budget this year of about 190 million
dollars, with China the second largest recipient of funds after
India.
   Dr. Sadik said African countries, many which have just begun
family planning programs, have been the worst hit by the withdrawal
of U.S. funds.
   She said other donors have increased their contributions in
recent years. But she said that as a result of the U.S. pullout
``we've had to stretch the programs out, and reduce their scope. We
did lose some momentum.''

   European foreign ministers likely will
delay their tough duties on some U.S. imports in an effort to defuse
tensions over a European ban on hormone-treated meat from America,
officials said today.
   The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European Economic
Community will meet Monday to discuss the conflict, which was
sparked Jan. 1 when the trading bloc imposed a prohibition on U.S.
meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.
   The ban affected about $100 million in sales of U.S. beef and
veal.
   Washington countered with 100 percent duties on a range of
European food imports, also affecting about $100 million in trade.
   Nico Wegter, a community spokesman, said the foreign ministers
will be asked to put into effect as soon as possible countermeasures
that would slap stiff duties on American imports of dried fruit and
walnuts.
   However, other officials said that a number of countries appear
to want to defer setting a date to give the two sides more time to
resolve the dispute, particularly with George Bush being sworn in as
the new U.S. president today.
   The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the ministers may
also want to await the outcome of a Feb. 8 meeting of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EEC intends to ask the 96-nation
GATT to declare the U.S. retaliatory measures in violation of the
international body's rules.
   The Geneva-based GATT attempts to remove trade barriers and
ensure the free movement of goods worldwide.
   Many U.S. farmers treat their animals with growth hormones, a
practice U.S. officials said is safe. The EEC said it believed such
meat poses a health risk.
   In Strausbourg, France, the European Parliament today backed the
meat ban and urged the United States to suspend its retaliatory
measures until the dispute is settled through GATT. The next GATT
meeting is set for Feb. 8.
   On Thursday, EEC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen
said he was considering submitting the ban to an international
scientific panel.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco, Object of Biggest Deal, Will Sell South African Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc.'s prospective new owner said
today it will sell the food-tobacco giant's holdings in South
Africa, two days after Michigan withdrew from a fund used to help
finance the record $24.53 billion takeover because of a new state
law barring investments in that country.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the New York investment house that
won the bidding for RJR late last year, confirmed reports that it
plans to sell Royal Beechnut to the division's South African
management, and sell the South African Preserving Co. as soon as
possible after the takeover is formally completed.
   The disclosures, made via Kohlberg's public relations agent Kekst
&amp; Co., appeared to be a reaction to the announcement Wednesday by
Michigan officials that they would prohibit a $110 million state
pension investment in a Kohlberg fund that will help finance the RJR
deal.
   Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman said such an investment
conflicted with a law effective Jan. 1 banning state investments in
companies with ties to South Africa due to that country's policy of
apartheid or race separation.
   Bowman's move marked the second state to pull out of the Kohlberg
fund because of the RJR-South African relationship, possibly
signaling more defections from pension-fund investors that are
considered important financiers of the deal. Earlier, Massachusetts
withdrew $25 million.
   RJR is one of 95 U.S. companies with South African involvement,
according to a list Bowman compiled in compliance with the Michigan
law which took effect Jan. 1.
   Bowman said Wednesday that Kohlberg officials had indicated to
him the South African holdings would be sold off as soon as the
acquisition of RJR was completed. But he said the new law still
required state withdrawal because RJR's South African interests
haven't been sold yet.
   Kohlberg said Michigan's withdrawal would have no effect on
completion of the RJR takeover, which is to be financed largely by
bank debt and the sale of high-risk, high-yield ``junk bonds.''
   RJR is an Atlanta-based maker of hundreds of consumer items
ranging from Oreo cookies to Winston cigarettes. Kohlberg won a
bidding war with RJR management to acquire the company Nov. 30.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade with the soybean market
leading the way down amid reports of improved growing conditions for
the South American soybean crop.
   ``They had more rain in Argentina and Brazil overnight _ not a
real lot but, at least for the time being, enough to allay any
fears,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   He said follow-through selling from Thursday's weak close and
lower cash prices for soybeans on European markets added to the
bearish tone.
   The drop in soybean prices tended to drag down the grain markets.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2} cents lower with the

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc. announced today it has signed an
agreement to sell its 78 percent stake in Texaco Canada Inc. to
Imperial Oil Ltd of Canada for $34.36 a share in cash, or $3.24
billion.
   Texaco said Imperial also agreed to make a $34.36-a-share tender
offer for the remaining 26.59 million shares held by some 4,500
minority shareholders, bringing the total value of the deal for all
120.77 million Texaco Canada shares amounts to $4.15 billion.
   Texaco Canada also was expected to issue special common stock
dividends totaling 75 cents a share, out of which Texaco will get
$59.1 million, said Texaco spokesman Peter Maneri.
   That, together with a special dividend to be issued on Feb. 1 of
$6.50 a share, or $514 million, brings the total value of the deal
for Texaco to $3.813 billion, Maneri said.
   Toronto-based Imperial, 70 percent owned by Exxon Corp. _ the
biggest U.S. oil company _ is Canada's largest integrated oil
company. Texaco Canada is Canada's fourth largest oil company, with
about 3,200 employees.
   Texaco shares were up 75 cents to $55.50 a share in mid-day New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   The sale includes, among other assets, two refineries with a
combined capacity of 115,000 barrels a day, and 1,800 gas stations.
   The sale of Texaco Canada marks one of the final steps in
Texaco's restructuring following its emergence from bankruptcy court
protection last April.
   Texaco had expected to raise some $5 billion in cash primariy
through the sale of assets. However, today's sale boosts that amount
by more than $2 billion, analysts said.
   ``Now that we have substantially completed the major asset sale
of our restructuring, announced just one year ago, we can focus on
implementing the planned distribution of $1.7 billion to our
shareholders,'' said James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief
executive officer.
   Texaco had promised to issue the $1.7 billion in proceeds from
the sales to shareholders once the assets were sold. Kinnear said
announcement of the distribution would be made ``as soon as
practical.''
   Texaco's largest shareholder, takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn,
has been pressuring the company to increase the value of its stock,
partly with the dividend payments raised by the asset sales. Icahn
has indicated he might mount another proxy fight to win control of
Texaco's board _ he waged an unsuccessful proxy battle last June _
if the asset sales did not produce the shareholder benefits he
wanted.
   The sale is subject to Canadian government approval and is
expected to face stiff opposition from those worried about growing
corporate monopolies.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES thruout with Rowland's victory reversed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British tycoon suffered a fresh reversal Friday
in his four-year war to wrest the Harrods department store from the
Al-Fayed brothers of Egypt in one of Britain's most bitter business
rivalries.
   The Court of Appeal reversed a High Court ruling won by Roland W.
``Tiny'' Rowland four days ago ordering the government to refer the
Al-Fayeds' 1985, $1.1 billion acquisition of Harrods' owner House of
Fraser PLC to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
   That commission could have ordered the unprecedented divestiture
of the 100-store retailing group.
   Friday's ruling, which Rowland is appealing to the House of
Lords, Britain's highest court, is the latest twist in a saga more
like a prime-time soap opera than a corporate dispute.
   Rowland is the silver-haired 71-year-old chief executive of
Lonrho PLC, the far-flung British conglomerate with holdings that
range from the Observer newspaper to extensive interests in Africa.
   His dream of owning Harrods was shattered in what he considers a
most galling manner. As part of his maneuverings, he sold his 30
percent stake in House of Fraser to the Al-Fayeds, believing them to
be unlikely competitors, only to see the Egyptians use the stake to
snatch the prize from his grasp.
   Since then he has pursued a strenuous, expensive anti-Al-Fayed
campaign through the Observer, brochures, the courts and regulators.
   Mohamed Al-Fayed, 55, is a paunchy, balding and flamboyant
businessman whose family has interests in shipping, real estate in
Europe and the Ritz Hotel in Paris. He has spent millions
refurbishing the 139-year-old flagship Harrods store in London, his
pride and joy. Chairman of House of Fraser, he occasionally works
behind Harrods' counters.
   An Anglophile who has lived in England for 30 years, Al-Fayed
recently was pictured in The Times of London fishing with his son on
his Scottish estate.
   Lonrho has accused the Al-Fayeds, Mohamed, Aly and Salah, of
exaggerating their background and wealth to win credibility, and of
lying about the source of the money for the takeover.
   It has alleged that the Al-Fayeds were indirectly financed by the
Sultan of Brunei, the world's richest man, with whom Al-Fayed has
done business.
   Inspectors from the Serious Fraud Office are investigating the
takeover. Lonrho's allegations are denied by both the Al-Fayeds and
the sultan.
   Lonrho also accuses House of Fraser of running up large debts to
modernize Harrods which are likely to hurt the business.
   Privately held, House of Fraser does not disclose financial
results.
   Rowland has written in the Observer that the affair ``is the
worst thing I've ever seen in business, that deceits triumph so
well, and can even find apologists when they are exposed.''
   Al-Fayed told the Sunday Times last summer: ``My conscience is
clear, I have kept my dignity. Can Rowland say the same thing?''
   He added. ``There is no way I'll sell Harrods. It will be in my
family for 1,000 years.''
   Rowland's chance for a victory came when the High Court threw the
fight toward the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the only
regulatory body which could force the Al-Fayeds to sell the company,
a divestiture possibly worth as much as $3.5 billion.
   The three-judge court also said Trade Secretary Lord Young had
improperly refused to publish a report of a government inquiry into
the takeover and told him to reconsider.
   The Court of Appeals said it would publish its reasons for
reversing the rulings on Monday.
   The drama began in 1975 when Mohamed Al-Fayed, Lonrho's second
largest shareholder, briefly joined its board of directors.
   Later, Lonrho built up a 29.9 percent stake in House of Fraser,
and in 1981 tried to buy it. The monopolies commission blocked the
takeover for competitive reasons, whereupon Lonrho sold its stake to
the Al-Fayeds.
   The Al-Fayeds launched their friendly offer in 1985, just days
before the monopolies commission, too late, decided to clear
Lonrho's bid after all.

   Stroh Brewery Co. hopes a new blue label and a
change in its script ``Stroh's'' logo in April will better denote a
premium beer.
   Stroh's white, gold, black and red label will become
predominantly ``a rich blue, a deep blue,'' Jack Barthwell, Stroh's
vice president for corporate communications, said Thursday.
   The ``Stroh's'' typeface will be changed to make the lettering
seem to ``pop out,'' catching the eye, Barthwell said.
   Packaging for Stroh Light will change from white to silver, which
Barthwell said ``better communicates the notion of light beer to the
consumer.''
   In addition to the label changes, Stroh plans to increase its use
of long-neck bottles, which Barthwell said have regained popularity
with consumers.
   The changes were suggested by Hal Riney &amp; Partners of San
Francisco, which became Stroh's advertising agency in July,
Barthwell said.
   Stroh's beer sales dropped 5.4 percent in 1988, according to Beer
Marketers' Insights, an industry newsletter.
   While Stroh's announced a packing face-lift, rival brewer Adolph
Coors Co. recently said it would partially roll back a packaging
change, citing customer confusion.
   The Golden, Colo., brewer said Thursday it would abandon the
``Original Draft'' tag it began putting on packing for its flagship
beer seven months ago, saying too many customers thought the brew's
ingredients had been changed.
   The new labels simply will say ``Coors,'' said Mike Marranzino,
brand director for the brewer.
   He said the label design changes made when the ``Original Draft''
name was added will be retained because beer drinkers like the
``contemporary look.''

   Dow Chemical Co. said Friday it decided to
keep its middle name _ as well as the first and last _ after a
six-month study concluded the company shouldn't change its
92-year-old identity.
   Dow's president and chief executive officer, Frank Popoff, said
an internal committee and an outside consultant looked into changing
the corporate identity for more than six months before recommending
against any change.
   Company spokesman Tom Henderson said he did not know how much the
study cost. He declined to reveal any of the alternate names or
identities that may have been considered, saying such information
was confidential.
   In October, reports on the study said the company was considering
dropping ``chemical'' from its name. Henderson said at the time that
if there were to be a name change, it would be because of Dow's
expanding role in non-chemical fields, including insulation and
household goods.
   Henderson said Friday he didn't think that the association of the
Dow name with Napalm explosives and the Agent Orange defoliant used
during the Vietnam War had a lasting detrimental effect on the
company.
   ``I don't think it was part of the consideration of changing the
name,'' he said. ``We are not inundated any more with negatives
around the Agent Orange issue.''

<TEXT>
   A top aide to Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy
resigned Friday, saying he would fight suggestions he may be
implicated in an insider trading scandal that has grown into a major
embarrassment for the Socialist government.
   Alain Boublil, Beregovoy's chief of staff, said in his
resignation letter that he has been ``the object of a serious
campaign of rumors and accusations without being able to defend
myself because of the reserve required by my position. If this
silence were to continue it could lend credence to these slanders.''
   U.S. and French investigators are examining large purchases late
last year of stock in the American packaging company Triangle
Industries Inc. just before it was acquired by Pechiney SA, a French
government-owned aluminum manufacturer.
   Two close associates of President Francois Mitterrand were among
the investors who bought large amounts of Triangle stock when it was
trading at about $10 per share, then made huge profits when Pechiney
offered $56 per share Nov. 21 in its friendly takeover.
   Because Pechiney is state-owned, Boublil and other senior
government officials were kept informed of the secret negotiations
last fall between Triangle and Pechiney.
   Roger-Patrice Pelat, one of Mitterrand's closest friends, and Max
Theret, a businessman with close links to the Socialists, have
denied getting inside tips about the pending deal. The said they
made their investments based on publicly available information.
   Boublil, 41, a former advisor to Mitterrand, has not been
publicly accused of anything. But French news accounts of the
scandal have frequently speculated he might have been involved,
based on his key position.
   ``I am resigning so that I can respond to my accusers,'' Boublil
said in his letter.
   In accepting the resignation, Beregovoy said Boublil was ``the
victim of a campaign of rumors'' and said he was confident Boublil
would be able to defend his honor.
   The Pechiney affair has blossomed into a major scandal in the
French press, which has linked it to controversy over the
government's role in an unsuccessful corporate raid on Societe
Generale. The institution was one of the state-owned banks sold to
private investors by the previous conservative government of Premier
Jacques Chirac, which held power from 1986-1988.
   The French stock exchange watchdog body, the Commission des
Operations de Bourse, has said it has no evidence to support
suggestions that businessmen close to the Socialist government made
profits by buying Societe Generale stock before the abortive
takeover began and pushed up the price.
   ``We are demanding to know the truth,'' Alain Juppe, secretary
general of Chirac's Rally for the Republic party, said Thursday.
Juppe called for a vigorous investigation of both affairs, with the
results then made public.
   Public investigations are extremely rare in French political or
financial scandals, which often fade away inconclusively without
clear answers to questions posed in press commentaries.

<HEAD>Call These Companies Naive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of America's shrewdest, most successful
marketers of products and services are called naive in a new
corporate listing. They are accused of financing their enemies, and
eventually their own destruction.
   They ``misgive.'' They support organizations that are boring
holes in the hull of free enterprise. By acquiescing, says a preface
to the report, business leaders are as culpable as those who mean to
destroy the system.
   In short, they give lots of money to left-leaning groups
``advocating policies hostile to corporate interests,'' says the
Capital Research Center, a private, Washington-based group that
monitors corporate giving.
   Leading the list are Dayton Hudson, Coca-Cola, General Mills,
Pillsbury, Chemical Bank, Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Atlantic Richfield,
AT&amp;T, J.P. Morgan and Citicorp.
   The listings are contained in ``Patterns of Corporate
Philanthropy,'' written by Roger E. Meiners and David N. Laband,
Clemson University professors, with a preface by former Treasury
Secretary William E. Simon.
   The trend is not new, the center having documented it in a
similar volume last year by Marvin Olasky of the University of
Texas, who found that $7 of every $10 given by some companies was
for causes deemed inimical to their interests.
   And, says Simon, ``it existed for at least two decades before
that.''
   The book examines the public-affairs giving of the top 250
companies as compiled by Forbes Magazine. Recipient organizations
were categorized under such labels as ``radical left'' or ``left
liberal'' or ``liberal center left.''
   Groups with philosopical ratings of radical left were said to
favor a national restructuring along generally socialist lines, and
to ``embody a a national security and foreign policy perspective
that generally reflects ... the aims and interest of the Third World
and Communist Bloc.''
   Few groups rated a radical left label. In the domestic policy
area, the Center For Community Change was listed. Named in arms
control and foreign policy, and in domestic policy, was the
Institute For Policy Studies. Also included was the American Friends
Service Committee.
   Groups labeled left _ tending to favor accommodation with
anti-American Communist and Third World leaders in foreign policy
and government action at the expense of free market and private
voluntarisim _ include Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH, the Peace
Child Foundation, and Feminist Press.
   The liberal category was defined as ``establishment organizations
(that) advocate policies that lean toward a major activist role for
government in economic and social welfare rpograms and greater trust
in a detente-oriented appraoch to the Soviet Union and the Communist
Bloc generally.''
   Included in the liberal catgory was the Brookings Institution, a
well-known Washington think tank with a tradition of involvement and
influence in federal policy, and the National Planning Association.
   ``It isn't surprising that big business would try to `buy off'
some of its most outspoken critics,'' said Willa Anne Johnson,
president of the center. ``Unfortunately, it doesn't work.''
   She contended that many groups call themselves civil rights
organizations, but ``a careful review of their activities shows
contempt, and sometimes open hostility, toward the American
enterprise system which makes progress possible.''
   The ten companies named, ``and many others like them,'' she said,
``are at the very least naive in their giving.''
   The study showed that more than two-thirds of the grants made by
the Forbes 250 companies went to liberal organizations, and such
organizations received 58.5 percent of the grant dollars compared
with 36 percent donated to the more conservative groups.
   Said Simon, a wealthy businessman, investor and president of the
John M. Olin Foundation:
   ``What is going on is that leaders of the American free
enterprise system, or people acting in their name and with corporate
profits _ are financing the destruction of their own system and
ultimately of our free society.''

<HEAD>Official: EEC Likely to Hold Off Imposing Duties on U.S. Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   European foreign ministers will likely
delay implementation of tough duties on some U.S. imports in an
effort to defuse tensions over a ban on hormone-treated meat from
America, officials said Friday.
   The foreign ministers of the 12 nations of the European Economic
Community will meet Monday to discuss the conflict sparked Jan. 1
when the trading bloc banned imports of U.S. meat from cattle
treated with growth hormones.
   The United States retaliated by imposing, also on Jan. 1, higher
tariffs on a variety of products from the community, also known as
the Common Market.
   Nico Wegter, a community spokesman, said the foreign ministers
will be asked to implement as soon as possible counter-measures that
would slap stiff duties on American imports of dried fruit and
walnuts. he package was tentatively approved earlier this month by
the governments' representatives in Brussels.
   But other officials said a number of countries apparently want to
defer setting an effective date in order to give the two sides more
time to resolve the dispute, particularly with George Bush taking
office as the new U.S. president.
   Many countries, said one official, want to ``see if there's still
a possibility of getting the new administration moving.''
   The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the ministers may
also want to await the outcome of a Feb. 8 meeting of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EEC intends to ask the 96-nation
GATT to declare the U.S. retaliatory measures in violation of the
international body's rules.
   Moreover, officials have been following reports that some small
U.S. slaughterhouses and packaging firms have offered to ship
untreated meat to Europe. ``It is an encouraging sign and should be
explored to see how far this can go,'' said an official.
   As a result, the officials said, it was likely the foreign
ministers would decide to continue watching the situation and
discuss it again in February or March.
   The dispute was touched off by an EEC decision to prohibit for
health reasons meat from animals treated with growth hormones. The
United States _ which exports about $100 million of such meat to the
EEC annually _ contends the use of certain hormones to fatten
animals, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose a
health risk.
   The United States has urged the Europeans to let GATT's Committee
on Technical Barriers to Trade, also known as the Standards Code
Committee, decide the issue on scientific grounds.
   The EEC has insisted that GATT should consider only whether the
community has the right to impose such a ban to protect the health
of its consumers.
   But there was some hint the community was shifting its position.
   Frans Andriessen, the EEC's top trading official, told the
European Parliament, the community's legislative body, on Thursday
that scientific factors could be considered.
   ``One doesn't need to exclude the scientific judgment in the
total framework of this problem,'' he said.
   Wegter denied that Andriessen's remarks represented a shift, but
other officials saw the comments as marking a weakening of the
European position.
   The meat ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the
trading bloc agreed to a one-year delay. The EEC refused further
U.S. appeals for a postponement.
   In retaliation, the United States imposed 100 percent duties on
boneless beef, pork hams and shoulders and a variety of other
European products. The sanctions are worth about $100 million.
   Both sides agreed to allow a grace period until the end of
January for sanctioned products to enter their borders. This applies
to goods in transit before Jan. 1.
   The disputed goods represent a tiny fraction of the estimated
$166 billion in trade last year between the United States and the
Common Market.
   Common Market members are: France, West Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.

   The U.S. dollar declined against major currencies
in European trading Friday amid reports of continued central-bank
intervention. Gold prices rose.
   The dollar slipped earlier in Asian trading after the concerted
selling of dollars by the U.S. Federal Reserve and European central
banks on Thursday, dealers said.
   The central banks were active again Friday in a thinner market,
dealers said.
   The West German Bundesbank intervened early in the day and did so
again in the early afternoon when it was joined by the Fed and the
central banks of Britain, Switzerland, Italy, France, Austria and
Belgium, they said.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7670 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's $1.7615.
   Other late rates for the dollar Friday compared with Thursday's
late rates: 1.8425 West German marks, down from 1.8672; 1.5665 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5805; 6.2715 French francs, down from 6.3315;
2.080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1060; 1,351.75 Italian lire, down

   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 128.05 Japanese yen from
129.20 Thursday. In London late Friday the dollar traded higher at
128.15 yen.
   Gold prices rose as the dollar declined.
   The closing bid price in London was $405.25 a troy ounce, up from
$402.50. The Zurich close was $404.85 bid, up from $403.40.
   In Hong Kong earlier, gold closed at $406.09 an ounce, up from

   The stock market drifted lower today, biding its
time through the change of command in Washington.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.15 to 2,231.96

   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading

   Analysts said the market had benefited in recent weeks from
increasing expectations for George Bush's presidency.
   But by about midday on Thursday, they said, the mood among
investors began to change from anticipation to watchful waiting.
   The market's recent rally stalled when the Dow Jones industrial
average moved close to 2,250 _ about the level where it stood on
Oct. 16, 1987, just before the crash on Black Monday.
   Brokers said that could turn out to be something of a

   Digital Equipment rose 2 to 106~. On Thursday the company

   Alcoa climbed | to 61~. The company increased its dividend and

<HEAD>Old Fishermen Reel In $1,400 Each As Union Sails Into Sunset</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 32 years, about 70 retired Mississippi
Gulf Coast fishermen have reeled in a nice retirement catch _ about
$1,400 each as they disbanded their union.
   The fishermen, who hadn't met as members of the old Gulf Coast
Shrimpers and Oystermen Association in 32 years, voted in Chancery
Court in Biloxi this week to dissolve their organization.
   ``There are not enough old men here left to reorganize (the
union) and certainly not enough to go fishing,'' temporary union
chairman Carlyle Able told the gathering.
   Members responded by voting unanimously to dissolve the
association and divvy up an estimated $135,000 in union funds.
   Chancery Judge William Stewart called the fishermen to the
Harrison County Courthouse Thursday and ordered them to decide if
they wanted to dissolve the association and collect their share of
the money.
   The money has remained in Coast banks since 1957, the year of the
last union meeting in which dues were collected.
   In meetings in the 1940s and 1950s, there were often arguments
and fist-fights among union members, members said. As many as 4,000
fishermen from the Coast were part of the association.
   Thursday's meeting was marked with some dissension, but not a
ruckus.
   After court officials found a courtroom that could accommodate
the 200 fishermen and family members, Stewart warned those in
attendance to keep the meeting orderly.
   ``Right now court is in session,'' Stewart said. ``This is not
outside on the streets.
   ``This is in a courtroom,'' he said. ``There is only one way to
have a meeting, and that is to be quiet.''
   Biloxi fisherman Henry L. Wescovich asked Stewart to decide late
last year what to do about the union and its money. A key
consideration in the case was whether the union still existed or if
it became defunct in 1957.
   The union's bylaws state that only those members living and in
good standing could share in the funds if the union still existed.
Had the union been dissolved in 1957, heirs of the members might
have had a claim to the $135,000.
   Union members quit meeting regularly after the association was
found in violation of the Sherman Anit-Trust Act in 1955, union
members said.
   But Stewart ruled last month that the union still existed because
it never officially was dissolved. He listed about 700 fishermen who

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reverses Lonrho Victory In Harrods Takeover Controversy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Court of Appeal on Friday rejected Lonrho PLC's
attempt to force an investigation of the 1985 takeover of House of
Fraser PLC, the owner of Harrods department store, by the Al-Fayed
brothers of Egypt.
   Lonrho said it will now put the case before the House of Lords,
the highest appeals court in Britain.
   The original Sunday deadline for a decision on a referral to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission for investigation of the takeover
was extended pending a House of Lords ruling.
   The commission is the only body that could order the
unprecedented reversal of the Al-Fayed's $1.1 billion takeover of
the 100-store retailing group.
   The reversal is sought by Roland W. ``Tiny'' Rowland, the chief
executive of Lonrho, the far-flung British conglomerate with
holdings that range from the Observer newspaper to extensive
interests in Africa.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young has refused to refer the matter to the
commission for investigation.
   The appeal court verdict reversed a High Court ruling Tuesday
ordering Young to refer the matter to the commission and to
reconsider his refusal to publish a government inquiry into the
takeover.
   Lonrho has fought a prolonged campaign to undo the Al-Fayed
takeover after its own effort to buy House of Fraser was blocked by
the commission in 1981. The government subsequently allowed the
Al-Fayeds to buy the group, without facing a commission inquiry.
   However, the government later decided to launch an inquiry into
the takeover. Official inspectors completed a 15-month review of the
takeover last summer that uncovered as-yet undisclosed new facts.
   But Lord Young decided in September not to refer the Al-Fayed
purchase to the commission, prompting Lonrho to launch a court
action to reverse Young's decision. He also refused to publish the
inspectors' report, saying it might prejudice investigations by the
Serious Fraud Office, which is also looking into the takeover.
   The appeals court said it would give the reasoning behind its
judgment on Monday.

   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the

strong.
   Grain futures finished mostly lower in sympathy with the soybean
market, analysts said.
   Last week's Agriculture Department crop report showing
larger-than-expected soybean supplies continued to weigh on the

added to the bearish price outlook, analysts said.
   ``There was more rain overnight in Argentina and indications of

<HEAD>Eagle Bus Enjoying Smooth Ride Since Takeover By Greyhound</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto DN6 of Jan. 17.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's No. 2 maker of big highway
buses, rapidly weakening a few years ago, has recharged and now
enjoys orders from clients that range from mass transit operators to
touring pop-music stars.
   Eagle Bus Manufacturing Inc. began its smooth financial ride when
it became a subsidiary of Greyhound Lines Inc., the company that
carries the most people between U.S. cities by bus.
   ``We actually shut this place down three times because of lack of
orders in 1987,'' said Vern Tull, executive vice president and head
of sales for Brownsville-based Eagle.
   Eagle's revival came four months after an investor group headed
by Dallas entrepreneur Fred Currey in March 1987 bought operating
assets of Greyhound Lines Inc. from its parent company, the Phoenix,
Ariz.-based Greyhound Corp.
   In July 1987, Currey's group acquired selected assets of
competitor Trailways Lines Inc., including Trailways'
Brownsville-based bus-manufacturing subsidiary, Eagle International
Inc.
   Eagle had traveled a downward curve with its sluggish Trailways
parent for years. Potential Eagle bus buyers shunned a product that
appeared to verge on demise, said George Gravley, Greyhound Lines
spokesman in Dallas.
   ``Trailways was the main user of the Eagle bus, so the feeling
was that if Trailways were to go out of business, then there would
be no Eagle bus,'' Gravley said. ``The day that we bought it, it
became a viable bus manufacturer. Potential customers had confidence
that it was going to be around.''
   With Greyhound Lines' backing, Eagle's business multiplied from
75 buses produced in 1987 to 300 in 1988, a 400 percent increase,
Tull said. Eagle's sales jumped from $20 million in 1987 to $70
million for 1988, he said, with the work force tripling to about 550.
   While it may seem only natural that a bus maker would do well if
owned by a resurgent passenger bus carrier _ a built-in customer _
company officials point out that only 50 of the Eagles produced in
1988 went to the parent company.
   Greyhound Lines remains under contract to buy buses from its
former parent company, The Greyhound Corp., which remains its
largest competitor in the bus manufacturing business. The Greyhound
Corp.'s subsidiaries produce two-thirds of the intercity buses in
North America.
   While Greyhound Lines bought 50 Eagles in 1988, it purchased 151
buses from Motor Coach Industries Inc., a subsidiary of the
Phoenix-based competition, which still retains a 22.5 percent
interest in Greyhound Lines.
   Under the 1987 deal in which Currey, former Trailways chief
executive officer, and other investors formed the new Greyhound
Lines in Dallas, the Currey group is obligated to continue buying
buses from the old parent company.
   Motor Coach buses will remain the mainstay of the Greyhound Lines
fleet, which totaled 3,904 at the end of the year, Gravley said.
   The only Eagles in the Greyhound Lines fleet are the 50 new ones
the Currey group bought and about 450 acquired in the Trailways deal.
   Eagle's business plan projects th company making 400 buses in
1989, with no orders yet from the parent company.
   Still, Tull said, the 50-bus order from Greyhound Lines was
Eagle's most important order.
   ``It put out a notice that he (Currey) believes in Eagle and that
they intend to support Eagle, and it really put a breath of life
into this company,'' Tull said.
   Eagle was the basic Trailways bus often ridiculed by Greyhound
drivers, but quality-control problems have disappeared with the new
ownership, Tull said.
   Major new orders at Eagle Bus since July 1987 include: 99 for the
Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority, 20 shipped to Egypt and 119
for New Jersey Transit.
   But Eagle president John Blondek said the small orders will keep
the company going. Blondek's aggressive sales approach and frequent
contacts with customers have won praise since he joined Eagle late
in 1987.
   ``Our business will thrive only if we tend the store with the
really important orders, and that's the onesies and twosies,'' said
Blondek.
   The Eagles come in three sizes: 35 feet with 41 seats, 40 feet
with 47 seats and 45 feet with 57 seats. Average cost is $195,000.
   Many entertainers have ordered custom Eagle coaches for touring,
including Willie Nelson, Randy Travis and the Pointer Sisters, Tull
said, because the suspension makes it easy to sleep on the road.
   ``You're not a star unless you have a gold record and an Eagle,''
he said.
   Greyhound Lines' attention to the market ``has caused a small
revival in the business of hauling people from point to point by
bus,'' Tull said. ``So that's really helped us a lot. Our whole
customer base is on the upswing.''
   Greyhound, Trailways and bus manufacturers languished earlier in
the decade from a combination of upstart competition that
accompanied deregulation of the industry, escalating insurance
costs, cheaper airfares and dropping oil prices that made car travel
cheaper.
   Miami-based travel industry consultant Jim Cammisa said the hard
times for the passenger bus industry appear over, partly due to the
new Greyhound Lines management and higher airfares.

<HEAD>Housing Starts Will Continue Decline Into 1989, Home Builders Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's home builders on Friday forecast a
7.4 percent decline in housing starts and a 5 percent drop in new
home sales this year, continuing a three-year decline.
   The forecast by the National Association of Home Builders came a
day after the Commerce Department reported 1988 housing starts of
1.49 million, an 8.2 percent decrease from 1987's 1.62 million.
   Despite the decline, NAHB economist David Seiders said housing
starts will remain above a million at an estimated 1.38 million.
``Frankly, that's not a bad year,'' he said.
   Seiders and other economists appearing Friday at the NAHB's
annual meeting in Atlanta said they expected the Federal Reserve
Board, the nation's central bank, to maintain a tight rein on
credit, causing interest rates to rise early in the year to restrain
inflationary pressures.
   ``The economy is destined to slow down in 1989. It has to,'' said
Seiders, although he added ``it would take a policy mistake'' to
bring about a recession.
   The popularity of adjustable rate mortgages since the last round
of rising interest rates also presents a new problem, the economists
said.
   Lynn Michaelis, the chief economist for the forest products firm
Weyerhaeuser Co., said mortgage holders could find themselves paying
as much as $10 billion more in house payments as increasing rates
are reflected in their loans.
   ``Most people have had a positive experience'' with ARMs, he
said, but now will face higher payments.
   Richard Pratt, chairman of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital,
admitted the phenomenon may cause delinquency rates to increase, but
said the overall impact is unclear.
   The economists estimated that ARMs account for about $500 billion
of the total $2 trillion mortgage debt.
   While some regions of the country have been especially hard hit
by housing declines, Seiders said 1989 will see an evening-out of
the differences.
   For example, the ``oil patch'' region of Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Texas had a 21.1 percent drop in housing starts last
year, he said, by far the steepest decline of any region.
   The same area should have only a 6.7 percent drop this year, he
said.
   While housing starts are going down, house prices will rise,
Seiders said, ``but at a slower pace than during the three previous
years.''
   ``Price appreciation will be slowest in the Northeast,'' he said,
as demand catches up with construction. Prices will rise most
rapidly on the West Coast, he said.
   Seiders also foresees a time when a house is again a good
investment.
   ``House price appreciation will exceed the overall rate of
inflation in the economy during the early 1990s,'' he said.
``Acceleration in new home prices will be relatively large because
of the growing importance of trade-up buyers.''
   The NAHB says almost two-thirds of all new homes built are
intended as ``trade-up'' homes, with a full array of amenities.
First-time buying remains strong, with about 8.5 million young
families expected to purchase their first home in the next four
years, the organization said.
   However, the industry's figures show a decline in the percentage
of young people who own their home.
   It said 35.9 percent of young adults aged 25 to 29 owned homes in
the third quarter of 1988, down from a high of 44 percent in 1979.

<HEAD>Whirlpool's Quarterly Loss Linked to Sale of Cabinet Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTON HARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whirlpool Corp. said Friday a poor
showing by its kitchen cabinet business and expected losses from
selling the business contributed to a $12 million fourth-quarter
loss and a 51 percent drop in earnings for all of 1988.
   But the appliance maker posted sales gains of 3.8 percent for the
quarter and 4.9 percent for the year despite declining sales
industrywide, capturing greater market shares in most product
categories, Whirlpool Chairman David R. Whitwam said.
   Whirlpool became the world's largest appliance concern with an
agreement earlier this month to purchase a majority of NV Philips'
appliance division.
   The net loss of $12 million, or 17 cents a share, reported for
the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with net earnings of $40.4
million, or 59 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1987, the
company said.
   Whirlpool reported fourth-quarter net sales of $994 million, up
from $958 million in the comparable period a year earlier.
   For the year, Whirlpool reported net earnings of $94.1 million,
or $1.36 a share, on net sales of $4.31 billion, compared with
$191.9 million, or $2.68 a share, on net sales of $4.11 billion in
1987.
   The major factor in the fourth-quarter loss and the drop in 1988
earnings was a loss of $52.9 million relating to the Whirlpool
Kitchens Inc. subsidiary, the company said.
   Whirlpool announced earlier this month it had agreed to sell the
business to a private investment partnership for an undisclosed
amount.
   The $52.9 million included the unit's 1988 operating losses and a
$45 million provision for the estimated loss connected with
disposing of the business, the company said.
   Whirlpool also reported costs of 20 cents a share for 1988 due to
warranty charges in connection with a product sold by its former
Heil-Quaker Corp. subsidiary.
   The heating- and cooling-system maker was sold in 1986 to
Intercity Gas Corp. in Canada. Whirlpool agreed to pay future
warranty costs in connection with an undisclosed Heil-Quaker
product, Whirlpool spokesman Dale F. Sorget said.
   Also cutting into Whirlpool's 1988 earnings were materials costs
that rose faster than its appliance prices, higher interest
expenses, and weaker results from Brazilian appliance-making and
compressor-manufacturing affiliates, the company said.
   This year will be tough for appliance makers, Whitwam said.
   ``We expect the highly competitive environment of the U.S. major
appliance industry to persist through 1989, with sales of the nine
major appliances to dealers dropping approximately 4 percent to 6
percent compared to 1988,'' he said.
   But he noted the Jan. 2 consummation of an agreement to acquire a
$470 million majority stake in the appliance division of Dutch
electronics giant NV Philips.
   ``The signing of our joint venture agreement ... has taken us
from a company traditionally based in the Americas to a position of
leadership in the global marketplace,'' Whitwam said.

   The stock market declined slightly Friday, biding

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.75 to 2,235.36,
closing out the week with a net gain of 9.29 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
659 up, 755 down and 547 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 166.10 million
shares, down from 192.03 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 193.85 million shares.
   Analysts said the market had benefited in recent weeks from
increasing expectations for George Bush's presidency.
   But by about midday on Thursday, they said, the mood among

   The market's recent rally stalled when the Dow Jones industrial

Oct. 16, 1987, just before the crash on Black Monday.
   Brokers said that could turn out to be something of a
psychological barrier for investors.
   A flurry of trading near the close occurred in stocks involved in
program trading strategies keyed to a set of expiring options and
futures on stock indexes. It did not, however, stir stock prices out
of the narrow range in which they fluctuated all day.
   Digital Equipment rose 2{ to 107]. On Thursday the company

   United Technologies jumped 1[ to 43~. The company reported record
earnings for 1988.
   Alcoa gained | to 61~ in active trading. The company increased

   Ausimont rose 1} to 35} after Montedison increased its offer for

   Texas Eastern climbed 1{ to 47\ on expectations that the company,
which is fighting a $42-a-share offer from Coastal Corp., would

   Briggs &amp; Stratton fell 1] to 28. The company posted a loss for
its latest quarter and said its earnings for all of the fiscal year
ending June 30 will be significantly below the previous year's

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

<HEAD>Dollar Falls for Second Day, Gold Rises</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell Friday for a second day as
central banks again intervened in foreign exchange markets to put a
cap on the U.S. currency's climb.
   Meanwhile, gold prices benefited from the dollar's decline.
Republic National Bank reported a bid of $408 for a troy ounce of
gold as of 4 p.m. EST, up $4.40 from late Thursday.
   Friday's dollar trading ``was a continuation of yesterday's
trend,'' said Robert Ryan, a senior foreign exchange trader with
Irving Trust Co.
   The central banks of several nations, including the West German
Bundesbank, the Bank of England and the Bank of France, sold dollars
Friday, as they did on Thursday.
   ``We've been buying, buying, buying since Dec. 1 ... and finally
the central banks forced some profit-taking,'' Ryan said.
   Richard Witten, vice president for foreign exchange at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., said the dollar moved up when President Bush referred
to the federal budget deficit in his inaugural address, but fell
back when Bush offered no specifics for closing the gap.
   Trading was light, dealers said.
   Ryan said activity on Monday and Tuesday would give an indication
of whether the dollar will continue to soar.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7670 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's $1.7615. In later New York
trading, the pound rose to $1.7765 from $1.7650.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.8365 West German marks, down from
1.85475; 1.5600 Swiss francs, down from 1.5775; 6.25975 French
francs, down from 6.3225; 1,346.125 Italian lire, down from
1,359.40; and 1.18935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18725.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Thursday's late rates, included: 1.8425 West German marks, down from
1.8672; 1.5665 Swiss francs, down from 1.5805; 6.2715 French francs,
down from 6.3315; 2.080 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1060; 1,351.75
Italian lire, down from 1,368.50; and 1.1868 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1890.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 128.05 Japanese yen from
129.20 Thursday. In London late Friday the dollar traded at 128.15
yen, and in New York, it fell to 127.675 yen from late Thursday's
128.655.
   Gold prices rose as the dollar declined, and also in response to
gains in the silver market, said Stephen Platt, a metals analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold rose to $408.50 a
troy ounce from $403.60 late Thursday.
   The closing bid in London was $405.25 a troy ounce, up from
$402.50. The Zurich close was $404.85, up from $403.40, and in Hong
Kong, gold closed at $406.09 a troy ounce, up from $403.83.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.05 a troy ounce, up
from $5.97. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver rose to
$6.183 a troy ounce from late Thursday's $5.976.

<HEAD>Eastern Discusses Possible Sale Of Gates, Routes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines and USAir confirmed Friday that
talks are under way between the two carriers over the possible sale
of certain Eastern gates at Philadelphia and routes between
Philadelphia and two Candian cities.
   But both airlines said no deal had been reached and indicated the
possibility that no sale would result from their negotiations.
   A statement released by Eastern in Miami identified its routes up
for sale as those linking Philadelphia with Toronto and Montreal.
   But the release did not name USAir as the other airline involved
in the discussions nor did it indicate how many Eastern gates were
up for sale.
   ``The negotiations have not been concluded and there is no
assurance they will be,'' said the statement from Eastern, a
subsidiary of Texas Air Corp.
   Yet USAir, in its own release issued in Washington, announced it
is the other airline discussing the possible deal with Eastern.
USAir also gave no number for the Eastern gates being considered.
   ``No agreement has been reached, and USAir is unable at this time
to say if or when an agreement will be reached,'' the carrier stated.
   According to Eastern, the Miami-based carrier would sublet one of
its gates from the buyer, if a sale were to go through, while a new
Eastern gate was being built.
   Eastern also announced it ``does not currently anticipate a
substantial reduction in its present schedule of 42 daily flights
from Philadelphia'' and expects the present flying schedule in the
city to remain intact until summer.
   The airline also said it expects only a few layoffs among its
Philadelphia-based staff of 385 employees if the deal goes through.
   Eastern has amassed losses of more than $1 billion over the past
decade, and still running up additional losses.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Soar Amid Soviet Buying Rumors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices soared by nearly 7 percent Friday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange in a rally led by trade houses
amid rumors of a large cocoa purchase by the Soviet Union.
   On other markets, orange juice futures fell sharply; precious
metals made strong gains; energy futures lost ground; grains and
soybeans were lower; livestock and meat futures were mixed; and
stock-index futures retreated.
   Cocoa settled $77 to $94 higher with the contract for delivery in
March at $1,461 a metric ton. A metric ton is 2,205 pounds.
   The rally was rooted in a surge of physical cocoa buying
overseas, some of which was attributed to the Soviet Union, although
analysts had their doubts.
   ``I'm a little skeptical as to thinking the Russians would come
into the market in such an unsophisticated fashion as to drive the
price up in a big way,'' said Kim Badenhop, an analyst with Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in New York.
   ``I emphasize my own skepticism,'' echoed analyst Arthur
Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, ``but,
nevertheless, that's one of the things we heard.''
   Analysts said cocoa trade houses were large-scale buyers on the
New York and London futures markets, with speculators jumping in as
prices rocketed through successive levels of resistance.
   The rally occurred against the backdrop of a meeting in London of
the International Cocoa Organization. The cocoa cartel is seeking a
means for stabilizing prices, which have been in a downward trend
because of a glut of cocoa following four years of excess production.
   Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice plummeted on
the New York Cotton Exchange in reaction to news that a large
Brazilian orange juice processor had cut its price to wholesalers by
nearly 19 percent to $1.50 a pound.
   Other Brazilian processors are expected to follow suit, said
Judith Ganes, an analyst in New York with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Ms. Ganes projected U.S. orange juice consumption for the
December-November crop year at 286 million gallons and imports from
Brazil at 83 million gallons.
   Orange juice settled 2 cents to 4.55 cents lower with March at
$1.4095 a pound.
   The silver futures market shook off its recent weakness and
climbed sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting renewed
concerns about inflation, analysts said.
   Silver for spot delivery fell below $6 a troy ounce early this
month and the low price apparently hs attracted some buyers, said
Sharon Ziemian, an analyst with Citibank in New York.
   ``For some years now, silver has always been a good buy under
$6,'' she said.
   Gold futures also climbed, borrowing some of their strength from
silver, she said.
   Gold settled $4.80 to $5.10 higher with February at $409.30 a
troy ounce; silver was 20.7 cents to 22.5 cents higher with March at
$6.245 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures plunged on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
weakening chart signals and profit-taking after a strong rally
earlier in the week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents to 42 cents
lower with February at $18.86 a barrel; heating oil was .60 cent to
1.15 cents lower with February at 52.60 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .32 cent to 1.08 cents lower with February at 51.78
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade
on selling linked to an improving supply outlook. Grain futures
finished narrowly mixed.
   Last week's Agriculture Department crop report showing
larger-than-expected soybean supplies continued to weigh on the
market, and reports of improved growing conditions in South America
added to the bearish price outlook, analysts said.
   Wheat settled \ cent lower to 2\ cents higher with March at $4.45
a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $2.67} a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 3 cents lower with March at $2.34 a
bushel; soybeans were 10} cents to 15 cents lower with March at
$7.50{ bushel.
   Cattle futures fell moderately while pork futures finished mixed
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent lower with February at
72.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .58 cent lower
with January at 84 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with February at 43.85 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .85 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at
40.25 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of stocks
represented by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled .50 point
lower at 288.75. The contract is worth $500 a point.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Drift Lower In Light Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices were mostly lower in light trading
Friday, declining along with the dollar.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7-16 point, or about
$4.40 per $1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.88 percent from 8.84
percent late Thursday.
   Kathleen Stephansen, a vice president and senior economist at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp., said the lower prices
on Treasury issues were a reaction to the dollar's decline.
   The dollar fell for a second day as central banks again
intervened, selling the currency in an effort to lower its price.
   A weak dollar usually hurts bond prices because it makes
dollar-denominated securities less attractive to foreigners and
produces inflation fears by making imports more expensive.
   James L. Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said he doubted that even the dollar had an impact on bond
trading Friday.
   ``Drifting is probably the word to use,'' he said of the day's
trading. ``And when markets drift, they generally drift lower.''
   He said it was ``one of those days where there were no economic
indicators released, nothing for people to focus upon _ a feeling
that the rally has taken the bond market to fairly high levels, and
that clients really don't have much to do except to see if we're
going to rally further.''
   Traders said President Bush's inaugural address, in which he
discussed the federal deficit but gave no specific plans for
reducing it, appeared to have little impact on bond prices.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell by between 3-32 point and 3-16 point, intermediate
maturities fell 3-16 point to 7-32 point, and long-term issues were
down from 5-16 point to 7-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.23 to 1,136.98.
   In corporate trading, industrials were down slightly. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 0.19 to 298.11.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was down 3-32 point at 92 11-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.66 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.52 percent as the
discount rose 4 basis points to 8.24 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.75 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to
8.28. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.91 percent as the discount
rose 4 basis points to 8.25 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 8~ percent, down from 9 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Mexico's Finance Minister to Washington to Discuss Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico is sending its U.S.-trained champion of
international finance to Washington this weekend to convince
creditors to give his country a break from its crushing foreign debt.
   Under pressure from time and heavy social needs, new President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari hopes for an agreement in two or three
months. He says Mexico needs the money to invest in growth, which he
hopes will reach a 4 percent rate starting next year.
   Mexican officials don't even want to think about the alternative
in a country where a high birth rate in the 1960s is now visible in
the yearly wave of 1 million new workers entering too small a labor
market.
   Mexico's leader in international finance is Finance Minister
Pedro Aspe Armella, a 39-year-old Ph.D. trained at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. The school is known for
its work in economics.
   Aspe recently told U.S. financiers they can trust Mexican
economists because they are the best.
   ``Most of us graduated from your schools,'' said the Cabinet
secretary, who has a quick smile and graying hair.
   Aspe said Mexico owes $103 billion, 40 percent of it to U.S.
banks.
   To keep up payments, Mexico has been losing the equivalent of
nearly 6 percent of its gross national product annually. Debt
service, which equals interest and principal, last year came to $13
billion.
   Earlier this month, Aspe met with U.S. officials, including
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   In those discussions, Aspe dramatized Mexico's plight, saying
Germany's World War I reparations led to hyperinflation and the rise
of Adolf Hitler, according to a source at the meeting who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Aspe reportedly said Germany was paying only
4 percent of its gross national product annually for reparations.
   Unless Mexico's total transfer of funds abroad is reduced to
about 2 percent of the gross national product, Mexico will not be
able to renew economic growth and will face severe economic and
social problems, government officials say. One Mexican official put
it this way: ``Dead clients pay no debts.''
   Aspe, traveling to Washington on Sunday two days after George
Bush takes office as president, will lead complicated negotiations
involving the United States, other governments, and hundreds of
banks.
   He is expected again to outline Salinas' position: Mexico is
doing its best to pay and deserves good treatment from creditors,
including new credit if needed.
   U.S. Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker has promised a
review of Latin American debt problems but has said he does not have
a ``magic wand'' to solve the problem.
   Mexico has avoided talk of suspending payments.
   ``We need creativity and imagination,'' said a government source
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We would like multi-annual
agreements that would assure us of a steady flow of capital for
several years, instead of annual negotiations for new funds.''
   ``There are those who feel we will never get out of this hole.
There are options ... in debt discounts,'' one official said.
   In the past six years, Mexico has reshaped its internal economic
policies towards a freer market, something Baker has called on other
debtor nations to do. It has cut public spending, reduced tariffs to
force its manufacturers to compete with imports, pushed through new
tax laws to broaden the tax base, and won labor and business
commitments to keep prices down.
   In a dramatic move to show he means to modernize Mexico, Salinas
jailed the leadership of the oil workers' union, whose power has
kept the government from reforming its oil monopoly, Pemex.
   But there's a limit to the sacrifices Mexico is willing to make
and Salinas wants cooperation of creditors who ``refuse to recognize
they made bad loans,'' one Mexican official said. He was referring
to loans made during the 1970s oil boom that buoyed Mexico until
prices collapsed.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. announced Friday it plans
to remove palm oil from Crisco, its vegetable-based shortening
product.
   The National Heart Savers Association, of Omaha, Neb., which has
been putting pressure on food manufacturers to alter product
ingredients, applauded Procter &amp; Gamble's announcement.
   Association president Phil Sokolof said that tropical oils,
including palm and coconut oils, increase a person's cholesterol
levels and raise the risk of heart disease.
   P&amp;G officials said Crisco is made mainly from soybean oil, with
palm oil added for stability and baking performance. The new palm
oil-free version is to be sold later this year as supplies of the
special grade of vegetable oil needed to meet Crisco's standards
become available, company officials said.
   The new Crisco, like the current product, will be all-vegetable
and contain no cholesterol. It will have the same purity, texture,
taste and cooking properties as the current product, P&amp;G officials
said.

<HEAD>Snowball Fight Launches Early Morning Currency Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE OWEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philadelphia Stock Exchange conjured up a
snowball fight Friday where there hasn't been snow for nearly three
weeks, then conjured up business at an unheard-of hour.
   Exchange president Nicholas Giordano rang the bell at 4:30 a.m.
to open trading in foreign currency options, launching an effort to
cater to European customers wanting a start better suited to their
business day.
   ``I'm exhausted,'' Dennis Smith, vice president of Flynn
Options-Hurricane Trading, said at the end of the day. But he said
the early start was a good move.
   ``I have a lot to gain out of it if we do a lot of business with
the Europeans,'' he said.
   In the expanded hours, 3{ hours longer than with the old 8 a.m.
start, the exchange reported 40,020 contracts, compared with the
December average of 32,605.
   The exchange introduced the new starting time to let currency
trading coincide with morning hours in Europe. When Giordano rang
the bell, the Paris clock on the wall read 10:30 a.m. and the London
clock 9:30 a.m.
   ``The feeling is if you can make the hours more conducive to the
business day in Europe, more business will emanate from the
Philadelphia exchange,'' said Barry Tague, president of Tague
Securities, the exchange's designated specialist firm in the
deutsche mark and the Japanese yen.
   To get publicity for the new hours, the exchange hosted a 4 a.m.
snowball-throwing contest outside the exchange _ no problem even in
a city that last had snow Jan. 2. Jack Frost Mountain Ski Area of
Lake Harmony, Pa., supplied the man-made ammunition.
   The first throw missed five currency symbols set up under
floodlights as targets on the street, but soon the U.S. dollar
symbol and the British pound fell, and within 15 minutes
participants were choosing each other as targets instead.
   Likewise, things began moving quickly on the trading floor, where
about 100 people were at work, compared with the usual daytime
150-200.
   Within five minutes, a furious auction erupted at one end of the
room, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. quickly executed an order for
650 contracts in West German mark options.
   ``It's important because it's important to Europe,'' Arnold
Staloff, president of the Philadelphia Board of Trade, said of the
early opening. ``Europe has been asking us to do this.''
   Europeans want the Philadelphia market, he said, because ``it's
the only viable listed market on currency options in the world.''
   The new hours are 4:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
the latter trading period began in September 1987 to cover the
Japanese morning hours.
   ``We'll make money certainly,'' Smith said. ``The biggest concern
here, with everybody, is will the volume done from 4:30 a.m. to 8
a.m. ... translate into new volume or will it be what we would have
done from 8 to 10 a.m. anyway?
   ``We're hoping obviously that it doesn't do the latter.''

<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. announced Thursday its
first-quarter earnings rose 53 percent, in part from the sale of its
Van Camp seafood business.
   Ralston Purina reported earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 of
$202.7 million, or $2.99 a share, up from $132.4 million, or $1.91 a
share, in the same period a year earlier.
   The results included an after-tax gain of $42.5 million from the
Van Camp sale. Without that gain, Ralston Purina's earnings would
have risen 21 percent.
   The company had sales of $1.68 billion, up from $1.51 billion.
   Operating profit for the firm's human and pet foods division
increased.
   The company also said the first-quarter operating profit for
Eveready Battery rose slightly from a year ago.
   Sales and operating profit for the company's soy protein products
increased substantially on higher worldwide volume.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Eastern Corp., the target of a $2.6 billion
hostile takeover bid by the Coastal Corp., was granted a motion
Friday by a federal appeals court that allows the company to pursue
legal action in other courts.
   Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Lynn N. Hughes granted a
preliminary injunction prohibiting Texas Eastern from initiating
litigation in another court without permission from the judge.
   Hughes' ruling came after Coastal and two Texas Eastern
stockholders filed suits seeking an injunction to keep Texas Eastern
from activating a ``poison pill'' defense to stop the tender offer.
   With a poison pill plan, a company typically gives its
shareholders the right to buy additional stock at a steep discount
once an unwelcome suitor buys a certain percentage of the company's
shares. It raises the costs of an uninvited takeover offer. Hughes
consolidated the suits and set a hearing for Feb. 6.
   But on Friday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans granted Texas Eastern's motion requesting a stay of Hughes'
preliminary injunction.
   Texas Eastern then filed a lawsuit against Coastal and Colorado
Interstate Corp., Coastal's wholly owned subsidiary, in a Chancery
Court in Delaware. The suit asks the court to rule that Texas
Eastern's poison pill plan is lawful. The plan was adopted in 1986
by the company's board of directors.
   Texas Eastern spokesman Fred Wichlep said Friday that no action
has been taken yet on the suit. He did not know if the Delaware
court would act on the issue before Hughes' planned hearing.
   Meanwhile, Texas Eastern's board and Coastal executives plan to
meet Sunday to discuss Coastal's offer. It will be the first
face-to-face meeting between officials from the two companies since
Coastal announced its $42-a-share bid for all Texas Eastern common
stock Monday. The offer is set to expire Feb. 13.
   If Houston-based Coastal's bid is successful, the consolidated
natural gas pipeline network would be the nation's largest in the
volume of gas transported.
   Coastal spokesman Bob Wells said Friday called Texas Eastern's
action an attempt to delay the takeover attempt in the courts. Wells
said a takeover probably cannot be fully completed until the issue
of the posion pill plan is finally resolved by the courts.
   But Wichlep said Texas Eastern was not trying to delay anything.
Texas Eastern had filed the suit in Delaware because both it and
Coastal are incorporated there and because Texas Eastern's purchase
rights plan is governed by Delaware law, he said.

<HEAD>Posts 59 Percent Increase In Earnings</HEAD>

   Primerica Corp. on Friday reported a 59
percent increase in earnings from continuing operations for 1988,
due in part to the sale of one of its subsidiaries and a strong
performance by its consumer finance division.
   Primerica, acquired by Commercial Credit Corp. in December,
reported net earnings from continuing operations of $161.8 million,
or $3.61 a share, for the year ended Dec. 31, compared to $101.5
million, or $2 a share, from continuing operations in 1987.
   Revenues for 1988 were $1 billion, compared to $912.3 million the
year before.
   Results for 1988 included nine months of revenues and income from
American Credit Indemnity, a subsidiary divested in October 1988,
and include a gain of $35 million from ACI's sale.
   Results reported Friday do not include 1988 results from the
operations of the former Primerica Corp., which was acquired by
Commercial Credit on Dec. 15. Results for the combined companies
will be reported starting during the first quarter of 1989.
   Fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $67.5
million, or $1.50 a share, on revenues of $291.5 million, compared
to $29.5 million, or 66 cents a share, on revenues of $234.9 million
for the same period a year ago.
   ``The Consumer Finance group produced strong results for the
year, reflecting improved operating efficiencies, good expense
control and expansion in the number of branch offices,'' Sanford I.
Weill, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a
statement.
   ``Although the company performed well in the proerty and casualty
insurance sector during the year, we are experiencing some of the
pricing pressure characteristic of the industry. We will continue to
be selective about the business we write and strive to keep overhead
in line with volume.''
   Primerica is a diversified financial services company with assets
of about $15 billion.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Rejects Tyson Bid</HEAD>

   The board of directors of Holly Farms Corp.
on Friday rejected a sweetened $1.15 billion buyout offer from rival
poultry producer Tyson Foods Inc., but invited Tyson and ConAgra
Inc. to continue bidding for the firm.
   In a statement, Holly Farms acknowledged that Tyson's
$63.50-a-share cash bid topped ConAgra's offer to buy the company in
a stock swap valued at $1 billion.
   However, Holly Farms said, its board had doubts that Tyson could
in fact pay $63.50 a share for the firm.
   Holly Farms said Tyson had been unwilling ``to provide the board
with appropriate assurances that Holly Farms' stockholders would in
fact have received $63.50 and not some lesser amount.''
   The directors also were not certain that Tyson would be able to
close the deal because of litigation resulting from Holly Farms'
proposed merger with ConAgra.
   Holly Farms agreed to be acquired by ConAgra in November as it
tried to fend off Tyson. The merger has been blocked by a Delaware
state court in response to a petition by Tyson, which argued that
Holly Farms was not acting in the best interest of its shareholders
in agreeing to the combination with ConAgra.
   ConAgra is appealing the decision.
   Tyson also objected to a provision of the proposed merger _ known
as a lock-up agreement _ that would have allowed ConAgra to buy
major parts of Holly Farms if their merger fell through.
   Tyson's offer was contingent upon the termination of the lock-up
agreement, which remains in effect. Holly Farms said it had asked
ConAgra to release it from the agreement.
   Despite the rejection, Tyson was optimistic it would ultimately
prevail.
   ``I think our problems now are not price problems and I think
these are problems we can work out,'' said Jim Blair, a Tyson
attorney.
   ``It's too bad they rejected (the latest offer) but it's good the
rejection isn't harsh,'' Blair said. ``Their investment advisers now
have quit saying our offers are inadequate. In fact, they've said
this one was fair.''
   There was no answer at ConAgra's Omaha, Neb. offices when a
reporter called for comment late Friday.
   Tyson's $1.15 billion bid was the latest and largest offer in a
struggle that began in October and pitted Springdale, Ark.-based
Tyson against ConAgra Inc. for control of Holly Farms.
   Tyson began its takeover attempt at $54 a share and had announced
a $60 offer to Holly Farms shareholders prior to the close of
bidding Wednesday.
   The Holly Farms board recommended that stockholders not tender
their shares to Tyson but said Tyson and ConAgra were invited to
submit further bids.
   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry processor while ConAgra is
the second-largest and Holly Farms ranks third.
