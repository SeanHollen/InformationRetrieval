   The driver of a car that slammed into a
tour bus, killing himself and three others, had just regained his
license the previous day after a suspension for driving to
endanger, police said Sunday.
   Kenneth Prior, 18, of Cushing also had lost his license on other
occasions for speeding and passing a stopped school bus, Department
of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland said.
   State police investigating the accident Sunday said they didn't
know yet what caused the accident on coastal U.S. Route 1 Saturday
afternoon. Prior's car crossed the center line and hit a Travel
Tours of Oklahoma bus taking 47 people to Newfoundland. All of the
dead were people in the car. Twenty others were injured.
   ``One of the few witnesses to the accident indicated that the
car veered into the northbound lane for 30 to 40 yards and did not
attempt to take evasive action,'' spokesman Stephen McCausland of
the Maine Public Safety Department said Sunday. The witness was a
passenger on the bus, he said.
   ``If it hadn't been for that bus driver, there would have been
more killed,'' said a witness, Dorothy Kidney, manager of the
nearby Loon's Cry Campgrounds. ``I don't know how he kept that bus
from tipping over.''
   Also among the dead were Prior's fiancee, Marilyn McDougal, 17,
of Warren, who was seven months pregnant; her 8-year-old brother,
Adam McDougal of Warren; and Donald Grant, 18, of Thomaston.
   Eighteen bus passengers were treated and released at Penobscot
Bay Medical Center in Rockport. Right after the first crash,
another car slammed into the wreckage when it was unable to swerve
out of the way, injuring two other people.
   Witnesses said that the first car burst into flames and that
people from the campground ran and pulled the McDougal boy out and
then used a fire extinguisher to douse the fire. The boy died later
at a hospital, while the other three victims died at the scene.
   A bus passenger, Clinton Riggs of Tulsa, Okla., also applauded
the bus driver, Kevin Finnigan, for doing ``a beautiful job, a real
professional job'' in controlling the bus. And he expressed
gratitude to citizens who rushed to help.
   ``There were some real good people there helping real fast,''
Riggs said. ``We tend to think of Easterners as being a little bit
selfish and cold-hearted, but we were really impressed.''
   Emmy Stidham, tour guide for Travel Tours of Oklahoma, said the
passengers were from Oklahoma and Kansas and were en route to
Bangor for the night before continuing on to Newfoundland.

   Anti-nuclear activists marked the 44th anniversary Sunday of the
bombing of Hiroshima with peaceful demonstrations at U.S. weapons
facilities, including an attempt by an estimated 3,530 people to
surround a Colorado plant.
   ``The people turned out to send a message to the president and
the world that we've got to stop the madness,'' said Steve Perry,
who organized the protest at the troubled Rocky Flats weapons
complex in Colorado.
   At the Nevada Test Site near Mercury, authorities arrested 52
demonstrators on trespass charges, said Department of Energy
spokesman Darwin Morgan. Thirty protesters were arrested at the
Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., which was
instrumental in developing the atomic bomb that devastated
Hiroshima.
   In Groton, Conn., four men were arrested and charged with
disorderly conduct after they climbed aboard the USS Nautilus, the
world's first nuclear submarine, during a vigil by about 25 people
to commemorate the anniversary.
   Demonstrations were also held at the Savannah River Site in
Aiken, S.C.; Livermore, Calif.; the Colorado Capitol in Denver; the
Ohio State Fair in Columbus; Princeton University and at Elizabeth,
N.J. A protest was also planned in Amarillo, Texas, where the first
bombs were assembled.
   In Andersonville, Ga., American prisoners of war who died in the
Aug. 6, 1945, attack were honored Saturday with a 21-gun salute and
the playing of ``Taps.''
   The protest at Rocky Flats, which makes plutonium triggers for
nuclear weapons 16 miles northwest of Denver, appeared to be the
largest, but demonstrators still failed to fulfill their goal of
encircling the plant.
   Organizers said 1,000 people per mile would be needed to join
hands around the plant's 17-mile perimeter. State police estimated
that 3,530 people showed up for the 30-minute protest in chilly,
windy weather and a light rain.
   A folk group sang ``America,'' ``This Land Is Your Land,'' and
``We Shall Overcome.''
   The demonstration organized by a group called Colorado Freeze
Voter had an environmental focus as well as an anti-war one.
   Rocky Flats, Savannah River and the Feed Materials Production
Center in Fenald, Ohio, have been targets of allegations of safety
and environmental problems. FBI and Environmental Protection Agency
investigators raided Rocky Flats on June 6, and a federal grand
jury began probing the plant on Tuesday.
   At the Colorado Capitol, about 400 people listened to music and
environmentalist speakers at a rally dedicated to the late Dr. Carl
Johnson, a former county health director who more than 10 years ago
warned that Rocky Flats endangered public health.
   ``Rocky Flats is like a loaded gun in a children's bedroom,''
said demonstrator Richard Chambers.
   About 90 demonstrators at the Nevada Test Site held a prayer
vigil to remember those killed at Hiroshima, Morgan said. Most then
walked on a road leading to the remote desert site, and 52 were
cited for trespass. All were released.
   ``It was very peaceful, very calm, very friendly,'' said Morgan.
   In Livermore, photographs and paintings of Hiroshima after the
bombing were displayed at a park, and a petition drive to make
surrounding Alameda County a nuclear-free zone was launched. The
northern California city is home to the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, a nuclear weapons research center.
   At Savannah River, where plutonium is made, members of the
environmental group Greenpeace held a vigil.
   The Ohio fair's Peace Pavillion was the site of a demonstration
by 168 members of the Columbus Campaign For Arms Control, said
pavillion activities coordinator Shirley Owen.
   Gov. Richard Celeste and his wife, Dagmar, attended a Japanese
tea ceremony there earlier, Ms. Bowen said.
   In Oak Ridge, Tenn., an estimated 300 to 350 people marched on
the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant. About 30 were arrested for
trespassing or interfering with arrest, said police Chief Timothy
Braaten.
   Among the approximately 140,000 people who died at Hiroshima
were nine U.S. airmen taken prisoner after their bombers were shot
down over Japan in July, 1945.
   A bronze plaque honoring the nine was unveiled Saturday at the
National Prisoner of War Museum at the Andersonville National
Historic Site, where a notorious Civil War prison once stood.
   The memorial 44 years later was a relief for Cathy Wheatley of
Atlanta, whose uncle, Airman 3rd Class Norman Roland Brissette, was
among those killed.
   ``For many years I was afraid that his death ... would be
forgotten,'' she said. ``We're happy that it is finally being
recognized.''

   Five Central American presidents failed to
agree on a timetable for dismantling U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels
as the chief executives ended on Sunday night the second day of
their three-day summit.
   ``There is no accord about a timetable, but there is agreement
on mechanisms,'' Honduran President Jose Azcona told a news
conference after the second round of talks.
   The five presidents agreed at a meeting last February in El
Salvador to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, but
postponed until this summit the ways to accomplish the task.
   The Bush administration wants to have the Contras, most of whom
are based in Honduras, remain intact until elections in Nicaragua
next February.
   Azcona said the U.S. government supplied documents to the
conference but has not tried to influence events.
   ``There was no pressure,'' he said.
   The U.S. government is not participating in the talks but sent
observers to the summit of the Presidents of Honduras, Nicaragua,
Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias had been optimistic earlier
Sunday on an agreement dealing with the Contras, estimated to have
about 11,000 fighters.
   ``Today we'll reach an agreement, by consensus or from
exhaustion,'' he told The Associated Press.
   The timetable for dismantling the Contras is the major issue at
the conference.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega told reporters he is flexible
about the timetable and said he expected the resettlement to be
gradual.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani said he hoped the peace
talks also will deal with the nine-year-old guerrilla war in El
Salvador.
   Ortega bolstered his position by signing an agreement Friday
with his domestic political opposition that calls for demobilizing
the rebels. In exchange, he pledged democratic reforms.
   ``We have made advances, we have achieved substantial points, we
have exchanged opinions,'' Ortega told reporters after running on
the beach in this tiny Caribbean port town.
   None of the presidents interviewed before Sunday's session would
give details of the talks in Tula, about 200 miles north of
Tegucigalpa, the capital.
   But they would speak of their aspirations.
   ``I've seen a willingness to go forward with the (peace)
process,'' said Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo. ``There are
difficulties and we could stumble, but I hope we can move forward.''
   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for drafting a 1987 Central
American peace accord and promoting regional dialogue said:
   ``The positions of the presidents seem to me very frank and
sincere.
   ``The world is expecting much from us, principally the 28
million Central Americans who don't want war. Not to advance would
be to betray those hopes.''
   On Saturday, Ortega presented a letter from the Salvadoran
rebels asking the summit to promote negotiations with the
government on the Salvadoran conflict.
   ``We look at it positively,'' Cristiani said of the message.
``They must contact us directly and we can look at how to begin a
dialogue.''
   Cristiani said his only condition for negotiations was that
``once the talks begin, the rebels not look for excuses to break
them.''
   Before the summit ends Monday leaders also hope to agree on a
plan that would allow U.N. observer forces to monitor the
Honduras-Nicaragua and Honduras-El Salvador borders.
   The Contras have been fighting the Sandinistas since 1981. They
allege the Nicarguan government betrayed the revolution that ousted
late President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, ending 42 years of rule by
his family.
   Fighting has declined to sporadic clashes since last year, when
the two sides signed a temporary truce and the United States halted
military aid to the rebels. The United States still provides the
Contras with humanitarian aid.
   Talks aimed at a permanent end to the 7-year-old war, which has
left 50,000 dead, stand at an impasse.

   Soviet officials will begin learning
management American-style early next year from a company whose
capitalist clients include Exxon.
   ``The Russians are very interested because such concepts as
openness, teamwork, mutual objective-setting; those things are
unknown there,'' said Paul McDonald, president of Scientific
Methods Inc.
   McDonald's company has received a $250,000 contract to conduct
seminars for officials at the Kiev Management School in the Ukraine
beginning in February.
   Management practices in the land of the planned economy are
anything but progressive, McDonald said.
   ``I think the state of management in manufacturing there is
probably the equivalent of what it was here in the 1930s,'' he
said. ``The economy was bad then, and people were willing to work
under some pretty grim conditions.''
   Under President Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to revitalize the
Soviet economy, things are changing and Soviet leaders are
receptive to ideas from the West that would have been unheard-of
only a few years ago, McDonald said.
   Scientific Methods, a 28-year-old company founded by University
of Texas professors Robert Blake and Jane Mouton, was among the
nation's first to adapt behavioral science theories to the
workplace.
   The company uses a grid system to measure employee satisfaction
and management effectiveness, balancing production and morale.
Elements include initiative, employee inquiries, conflict solving,
decision-making and critique.
   ``I think it's going to be radically different'' for some Soviet
managers, McDonald predicted. ``But if you begin to introduce these
new ideas, people are going to readily embrace them.''
   In addition to Exxon, Scientific Methods' U.S. clients include
the Internal Revenue Service.
   One of the firm's clients, which has a joint production venture
with the Soviet Ministry of Health, thought the training might be
good for its Soviet partners.
   The client brought the general manager of the venture's Soviet
plant to the United States for training, and the Soviet then
contacted the Kiev Management School.
   A contract was signed in June after McDonald and Blake, the
company's chairman, visited Kiev.
   The contract calls for six seminars initially, training up to 40
people at a time. The minster of health has indicated he will
attend the first, McDonald said.
   ``Eventually, we hope to train Russian instructors, as we do
with companies in the United States.''

   Two bumbling bank robbers nearly foiled
their own getaway when they drove a stolen car over nails they had
strewn on the pavement to slow their pursuers.
   The car, with a flattened tire, was found less than two blocks
away from the Mercantile Bank branch the men robbed Friday.
Witnesses said they saw the men hustle out of the car and run
across a weed-covered field with the bank's money after abandoning
the vehicle at a car wash.
   The men wore ski masks and dark blue jumpsuits when they entered
the bank, took an undetermined amount of money from teller drawers
and a cash machine and told the bank's employees to lie on the
floor.
   As they left, they padlocked a thick chain they had wrapped
around the handles of the bank's front doors, apparently to slow
any possible pursuers, but left untouched an open rear door, said
Detective Les Ramsey.
   As the robbers pulled out of the parking lot, they tossed out
several boards studded with nails, their points protruding upward
to flatten the tires of any pursuing vehicles.
   They then drove over one of the boards, Ramsey said.

<HEAD>EPA Chief Encouraged by Use of Fertilizer to Speed Oil Breakdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN GALLAGHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Applying fertilizer to help nature
decompose oil from the Exxon spill is the most encouraging
development so far in the response to the disaster, U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly said
Saturday.
   ``It's good news, and there hasn't been a lot where these oil
spills are concerned,'' Reilly said at a news conference.
   He said that by the time this season's beach cleanup ends in
mid-September, about 70 miles of shoreline will have been treated
with the available 500 metric tons of fertilizer. Oil has
contaminated nearly 800 miles of shoreline, according to the Coast
Guard.
   More of the French-made fertilizer will be manufactured by
spring, and there appears to be no limit on its use in future
cleanup of crude oil from the Exxon Valdez, Reilly said. The tanker
struck a reef in Prince William Sound on March 24, spilling nearly
11 million gallons of oil.
   Reilly, who on Friday inspected areas where EPA has tested the
fertilizer, said it was not clear how well the fertilizer will work
on aged oil.
   He said the EPA is committed to working on the cleanup until
restoration of affected areas is complete, and that he believes the
same is true of Exxon Corp.
   The oil company said last month that it expected to wrap up its
work in mid-September because of changing weather, and would
re-evaluate spill-affected areas next year to decide whether there
should be more work.
   Faced with charges by the state and others that the company was
reneging on an earlier promise to do whatever was necessary to
restore contaminated areas, company officials later said Exxon
would pursue beach cleanup in 1990 if directed by the Coast Guard.
Exxon Co. USA President W.D. Stevens told a congressional
subcommittee last week that the company would go along with any
``reasonable request.''
   State officials have been pressing for work over the winter as
weather permits, and for an unequivocal statement from Exxon that
it will be back in 1990 for more work that will satisfy state
standards.
   Exxon has an obligation and has made a commitment ``to stay the
course,'' Reilly said. But he added he is prepared to put pressure
on the company if work ends before restoration is complete.
   Restoration amounts to ``returning the sound as substantially as
possible to the condition that prevailed before the spill,'' Reilly
said. ``Obviously, in some areas that's going to be difficult to
achieve.''
   About $5 million has been spent on the fertilizer program, with
much of the money going for research. Exxon covered most of the
cost, and EPA expects the company to reimburse the agency for its
$1.6 million outlay, Reilly said.
   The treatment increases the number of microbes already eating
away at the oil. Reilly said the fertilizer can cut the time it
takes for oil to decompose from five to 10 years to three to five
years.
   ``What we have tried to do is speed nature up,'' Reilly said.
   The fertilizer method has not been used previously on Alaska
crude oil, nor has it been used on a large scale.
   Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the federal on-scene
coordinator of the spill cleanup, authorized Exxon a week ago to
use fertilizer on heavily fouled shorelines.

   A hurricane warning was posted Saturday for Bermuda
as Hurricane Dean churned north with 85 mph winds on a path heading
for the Atlantic Ocean island, forecasters said.
   At midnight EDT, Dean's center was located near 29.0 north
latitude and 64.5 west longitude, or 235 miles south of Bermuda.
   Little change in strength was expected, said forecasters at the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Dean was pushing north at 21 mph, and was expected to keep the
same heading for the next 24 hours, putting the center near Bermuda
on Sunday morning.
   Winds were expected to hit 50 mph in Bermuda, with gusts to 60
mph, on Sunday afternoon, Bermuda television said. Tides of 3 to 5
feet above normal were considered possible.
   The storm could easily miss Bermuda because of its small size,
but forecasters said they wanted to alert the island's 65,000
residents to the possibility of hurricane conditions.
   A hurricane watch was upgraded later in the day to a hurricane
warning.
   Planes from the U.S. Naval Air Station on the island flew toward
the storm.
   Stores and businesses in Bermuda have been closed since Thursday
for a four-day holiday that revolves around the island's
championship cricket match.
   The hurricane's strongest winds are limited to a small area near
the center, but tropical-storm force winds of 39 mph extend 125
miles east of the center and 50 miles to the west.
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, became a
tropical storm Monday night, passed the hurricane threshold of 74
mph winds Tuesday and threatened the northern Caribbean islands
before shifting north late in the week.

   A tour bus collided head-on with a car
Saturday, killing four people and injuring 20, authorities said.
   The accident occurred shortly before 4 p.m. on U.S. 1 and
involved a Travel Tours of Oklahoma bus carrying 43 people, many of
them senior citizens, state police Sgt. Herbert Cram said.
   The dead, including an 8-year-old boy and a pregnant girl, were

   A 10-year-old boy was hospitalized in fair condition, said
Penobscot Bay Medical Center spokesman Russell Donahue. The

   The first car burst into flames. People from a nearby campground
pulled a boy from the car, then put the fire out.
   The bus passengers were from Oklahoma and Arkansas, and were on

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said
Saturday that the only thing left to discuss regarding the
U.S.-supported Contra uerrillas is how to disband them.
   He and four other Central American presidents began a three-day
meeting in this Caribbean resort to complete work on a regional
peace accord that seeks to dismantle the Nicaraguan rebel force.
   The five presidents appeared together on a stage to formally
begin the talks. They made no statements during the ceremony.
   The presidents then spent seven hours in what Ortega called
``calm and constructive'' discussions.
   Ortega, the only leader who spoke to reporters after the
session, also said he delivered a letter from leftist rebels in El
Salvador saying they were ready to negotiate with the government.
He did not disclose details.
   Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani wants to link
demobilizing the Contras with negotiating an end to the 9-year-old
civil war in his own country. Nicaragua opposes that idea.
   On Friday, Ortega signed an agreement with the Nicaraguan
opposition that calls for disbanding the Contra rebel force in
exchange for electoral and political reforms.
   ``President Bush will have to accept reality, and the reality is
that the people of Central America are tired of war. We want peace
because Central Americans are dying, not Americans, and they should
respect our decisions,'' Ortega said as he arrived for the summit.
   He said the United States should take charge of disbanding the
rebels and that the final issue to be settled was ``how to get the
Contras out peacefully and in an orderly manner.''
   Although the United States halted arms supplies to the Contras
in 1988, it is still providing non-lethal aid to guerrillas and
family members camped in the Honduran mountains near the Nicaraguan
border.
   The Central American presidents agreed at a February summit in
El Salvador to resettle the Contras, but deferred considering
details until this meeting.
   It is Cristiani's first such meeting. Cristiani, of El
Salvador's right-wing Arena party, replaced Jose Napoleon Duarte as
president on June 1.
   Cristiani has said his government is ready to talk with the
Salvadoran rebels once they lay down their arms. Rebel leaders, who
met with Salvadoran oppostion parties in Mexico City last week, say
this is tantamount to surrender.
   ``We have been willing to negotiate with them since June 1,''
Cristiani said when he arrived in Tela.
   El Salvador accuses Nicaragua of arming the Salvadoran rebels.
   In Washington, Nicaraguan rebel leaders who met with President
Bush said demobilization of their force must be tied to democratic
reforms by the Sandinista government.
   The U.S. government in recent days has tried to urge Central
American governments not to abandon the Contras until general
elections scheduled in that country in February.
   Asked about the U.S. position, Guatemalan President Vinicio
Cerezo said on arrival, ``What is important is what the Central
American presidents decide.'' He said his government was neutral on
the issue.
   ``We are the ones responsible for finding answers to conflicts
that divide our peoples,'' said President Oscar Arias of Costa
Rica. Arias won the Nobel Peace prize for his efforts to reach a
regional accord in 1987.
   The U.S. government is not attending the talks, but Barry Sklar,
a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, said he
hopes to discuss a possible regional economic aid package with the
leaders.
   The leaders also hope to agree on a plan that would allow U.N.
forces to patrol the Honduras-Nicaragua and Honduras-El Salvador
borders. The United Nations has expressed its willingness to send
peacekeeping forces to the region.
   Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo said earlier that he would
present a plan to demobilize and resettle the 11,000 Contras and
12,000 dependents in his country along the Nicaraguan border. The
Contras have worn out their welcome in Honduras, where most
citizens would like to see the insurgents go home.
   Since last year, a cease-fire has been in effect between
Nicaragua and the U.S.-backed rebels. But the two sides have yet to
settle on a lasting peace.
   The Contras have been fighting the leftist Sandinistas since
1981, alleging the government betrayed the goals of the 1979
revolution that ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   El Salvador's civil war has left 70,000 dead, while 50,000
people have been killed in Nicaragua's conflict.
   The peace talks are taking place in this steamy Caribbean
resort, a collection of weather-beaten, wood-frame houses 200 miles
north of Tegucigalpa.

<HEAD>Iran Press Says More Anti-U.S. and Israel Strikes by Lebanon groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's kidnapping of a Lebanese Shiite
Moslem cleric has strengthened the belief of Lebanese Moslem groups
that they must strike against Israel and its supporters, an Iranian
daily said Sunday.
   Jomhori Islami, quoted by Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency,
referred to the abduction of Sheik Abdul-Karin Obeid by Israeli
commandos July 28.
   ``If any group questioned the infliction of blows on Israel and
the United States before the Zionist abduction of Jibchit's Friday
prayer leader (Obeid), they are now resolute in their decision that
there is no alternative but to inflict heavy blows on Zionist
occupiers and their supporters,'' the newspaper said.
   It welcomed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's
call for the release of all hostages held in Lebanon, according to
IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   But the newspaper criticized Perez de Cuellar for making the
suggestion only after the killing of American hostage Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins. The Marine's pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
abuductors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation for Obeid's
abduction.
   ``Why did he not ask for the release of all hostages earlier?
When the execution of another American became serious he
immediately thought about a solution,'' Jomhuri Islami said of
Perez de Cuellar.
   This reference was to U.S. hostage Joseph James Cicippio, 58,
who is being held by the Revolutionary Justice Organization,
another group of pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiites. The group gave him a
reprieve on Thursday and made a proposal for teh release of
Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in Israel.
   IRNA quoted the daily Abrar as echoing the words of Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani in saying that ``the Lebanese issue
and the hostage crisis have rational solutions provided the United
States and the West see the realities in the world.''
   Abrar said the United States and Israel conspired in the
kidnapping of Obeid.
   IRNA quoted the newspaper Kayhan International as saying that
Higgins and those facing a similar fate were victims of the
mistaken policies of the United States and Britain.
   ``If the United States and Britain did not support the terrorist
Israeli government ... the course of events would not be the way
they are today. Today they are reaping what they planted
yesterday,'' the paper said.

<HEAD>Bell Atlantic Workers Join NYNEX, PacTel In Striking; BellSouth Settles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing 41,000 telephone workers at Bell Atlantic
walked off the job Sunday morning, joining counterparts at NYNEX
Corp. and Pacific Telesis who had begun a strike hours earlier,
union and company spokesmen said.
   Mary O'Hara, district coordinator in Philadelphia for the
Communications Workers of America, said talks with Bell Atlantic
broke up around 6:45 a.m. and pickets were being set up.
   Bell Atlantic, based in Philadelphia, is parent to local phone
companies in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.
   Talks continued Sunday morning between another union, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and the Bell
Atlantic subsidiaries in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said Tom
Duddy, a spokesman for Bell of Pennsylvania. That union represents
11,000 operators and clerical workers at the two subsidiaries.
   Hours earlier, more than 100,000 CWA and IBEW workers walked out
at New York-based NYNEX and San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis.
   A tentative agreement was reached between the CWA and a fourth
regional telephone company, Atlanta-based BellSouth, which employs
64,000 union workers and provides phone service in nine states in
the Southeast.
   Officials have said that most direct-dial telephone calls would
not be affected by phone company walkouts, because they are handled
by automated equipment, but customers could expect delays in
directory assistance calls, operator-assisted calls and in service
and installation jobs.
   In all, 221,000 telecommunications workers were covered by the
talks to replace contracts that expired at 11:59 p.m. Saturday. The
four companies provide service to 24 states and the nation's
capital.
   The regional telephone companies, nicknamed ``Baby Bells,'' were
created by the 1984 breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   Contracts with three of the other ``Baby Bells'' _ Ameritech, US
West and Southwestern Bell _ expire next Saturday. Those three
companies employ 131,000 union workers and provide phone service in
24 states.
   The unions announced the strike against New York-based NYNEX
well before the 11:59 EDT deadline, saying myriad differences
remained. So great were the differences that no formal talks were
held Saturday.
   NYNEX serves seven Northeast states: New York, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and parts of
Connecticut. CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers; IBEW 20,000.
   Talks with Pacific Telesis, based in San Francisco, were held
throughout the day but the unions announced the strike there at
midnight _ 3 a.m. EDT.
   Pacific Telesis is parent company of California's Pacific Bell
Co. and Nevada Bell Telephone Co. CWA represents 42,000 Pacific
Telesis workers; IBEW 2,500.

   Residents taped up their windows and
stocked up on emergency supplies as Hurricane Dean swept north
toward the island Sunday, packing maximum sustained winds of 90 mph
and occasional gusts of 100 mph.
   The National Weather Service in Miami said that at 9 a.m. EDT,
Dean's center was located near 30.5 north latitude and 64.8 west
longitude, or 125 miles south of Bermuda.
   Air force reconnaissance reports indicated Dean was
strengthening while moving on a course just west of due north. On
that course the center was due to pass over or just to the west of
Bermuda near noon EDT, the weather service said.
   Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches was expected to accompany the
hurricane.
   Bermuda residents, some still celebrating an annual four-day
holiday weekend, were urged on Saturday to secure their homes,
making sure shutters were in good order and checking on stocks and
emergency supplies. On Sunday many windows of homes were already
taped up.
   Shops on Saturday did a roaring trade in candles and flashlights
as residents recalled the power cuts of Sept. 1987 after Hurricane
Emily rampaged across the 21-square-mile island, home to about
65,000 people.
   Sgt. John Instone, a spokesman for the Bermuda government's
emergency services, said Sunday that authorities were on ``bravo
alert'' _ the second of a three-stage series measuring weather
conditions.
   Lt. Caron Rupre at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Bermuda said
Dean was expected to pass Bermuda 25 miles to the southwest. But
she added: ``With Dean, there's potential for hurricane-force winds
of a much longer duration than Emily.''

   Gunmen ambushed and killed the mayor
of a northern town, and Communist rebels raided a town in the
central Philippines over the weekend, officials reported Sunday.
   Mayor Romulo Liclican of Diffun in Quirino province died
immediately and his driver was injured in the shooting Saturday
morning, said reports from the Philippine Constabulary headquarters
and the official Philippine News Agency.
   The pair were ambushed as they drove past a village 140 miles
northeast of Manila and five miles northwest of Diffun, the reports
said.
   Authorities could not immediately identify the suspects or
suggest a motive.
   On Samar island, about 200 New People's Army rebels raided the
Lorente town hall Friday and killed an employee, the military
reported. Samar is 380 miles southeast of Manila.
   Guerrillas searched houses for firearms and soldiers and fled
with five M-16 rifles, ammunition and radio equipment in stolen
vehicles, a police report said. It did not say why the government
employee was shot.
   The rebels have been fighting 20 years to establish a Marxist
state in the Philippines.

   Landslides were reported at nine places and roads were damaged
at 48 places in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, and six

   The storm, listed as Typhoon No. 13 as it approached Japan, had
weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon when it hit Choshi,
in Chiba, with winds of 68 mph.
   High winds at Tokyo's international airport at Narita, also in
Chiba, forced some arriving flights to be diverted to Nagoya,
central Japan, and Osaka, in western Japan.
   The Central Meteorological Agency said the storm was moving
north and was expected to cross into the Sea of Japan on Monday.

   A bomb hidden in a potato crate
exploded Sunday at a vegetable market in this frontier city,
killing four people and wounding 31, police said. In another city,
37 people were reported injured in two blasts.
   No one claimed responsibility for any of the bombs. In the past,
authorities have blamed such attacks on the Marxist government of
Afghanistan.
   Pakistan provides headquarters to the most powerful guerrilla
forces fighting to overthrow the Afghan government. Afghanistan
also claims that Pakistani forces are fighting with the guerrillas,
but Pakistan denies the claim.
   The bomb in the market went off shortly after dawn, authorities
said.
   The wounded included nine Afghan refugees, hospital officials
said.
   Most of the estimated 3 million Afghan war refugees in Pakistan
are housed in tent villages surrounding Peshawar, which is near the
Afghan border.
   In Rawalpindi 120 miles to the east, 37 people were injured when
two bombs about a mile apart ripped through a crowded area,
hospital sources said.
   The bombs, which were hidden in taxis, went off in midafternoon
within minutes of each other.
   One witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he saw
four people get out of one of the taxis 15 minutes before it
exploded.
   The explosions shattered windows in nearby buildings and
destroyed eight vehicles, witnesses said.
   Scores of shoppers fled in panic.
   ``There was a big blast, and people started running everywhere
trying to find a place to hide,'' said Abdul Salam. He was in a
hospital for treatment of facial cuts from flying shrapnel.

<HEAD>Miners Return After Strike in Soviet Vorkuta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coal miners who walked off their jobs to protest a
lack of information about government concessions returned to work
Sunday, the Tass news agency reported.
   The official news agency said all mines and associated coal
facilities of the Arctic Vorkuta region resumed work at midnight.
   Miners in 11 of the Pechora Coal Basin's 13 mines about 1,100
miles northeast of Moscow walked off their jobs Saturday in a
renewal of the labor unrest that wracked the Soviet Union last
month.
   The miners had said they would stay off the job until they
received the full text of a government decree that officials say
fulfills promises made to get the miners to return to work last
month.
   After the earlier round of strikes, the government agreed to
bonuses for night work and miners using some dangerous equipment;
improvements in pensions and overtime; and made general pledges to
improve housing and end shortages of food and consumer goods.
   Tass said the miners struck again because they didn't have a
copy of the government decree.
   An instructor in the Organizational Department of the local
Communist Party headquarters said in a telephone interview that a
director of the state-run enterprise that operates all 13 mines
brought a copy of the decree from Moscow and explained it to the
workers.
   The miners then decided to return to work, Tass said.
   The Vorkuta miners struck July 19, several days after thousands
of miners in other parts of the Soviet Union already had walked out.
   They demanded improvements in living and working conditions, and
also that the government pay more attention to the problems of
workers in the country's far north.
   The returned to work five days later but said they would walk
out again if the government did not live up to its promises.

   With the clang of a single bell and the
rush of 1,000 doves overhead, Hiroshima came to a standstill Sunday
for a moment of silence to recall the world's first nuclear attack
44 years ago.
   About 50,000 people gathered in the city's Peace Memorial Park
to mark the anniversary of the city's destruction by a U.S. atomic
bomb. Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said the memorial should ``sound
an alarm'' for the future, and he said Japan should carry out more
aggressive diplomacy to work for peace.
   At 8:15 a.m., the precise time when the bomb exploded in a flash
of white light on Aug. 6, 1945, Hiroshima residents, Japanese
government officials and foreign guests bowed their heads in silent
prayer while this city of 1 million came to a halt. A single bell
rang, and 1,000 doves were released.
   People on stopped buses and streetcars, and patients in their
hospital beds, prayed.
   At the same time, 1,000 people staged what they called a
``die-in'' in front of the Peace Park's A-Bomb Dome, a preserved
ruin from the atomic attack. The group of Japanese and foreign
anti-nuclear activists protested nuclear arms and appealed for
peace, a representative said.
   About 140,000 people died in the blast, firestorm and radiation
from the attack on this western Japanese city, a major military
center during World War II.
   ``Our country, as the sole nation to have suffered an atomic
attack, is determined that the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
should never be repeated,'' Uno told the crowd in the park. Many
were dressed in black mourning clothes, despite sweltering heat.
   Three days after the Hiroshima attack, the United States dropped
a second atom bomb on the coastal city of Nagasaki, killing 70,000
people. Japan surrendered unconditionally Aug. 15, 1945, ending the
war.
   ``We strongly feel the duty to use Hiroshima to sound an alarm
bell for the future of all humanity,'' Uno said. ``From now on,
Japan must carry out more aggressive diplomacy for peace and
security in the world,'' said Uno.
   He is about to step down as prime minister after a severe
election setback for his party.
   A group of mayors at an international peace conference,
including Anne Rudin of Sacramento, Calif., and Herbert Schmalstieg
of Hanover, West Germany, placed a wreath of yellow chrysanthemums
beside a granite tomb dedicated to the bomb victims. Chrysanthemums
are a traditional mourning flower.
   ``The people of Hiroshima have turned this into a positive thing
because they have educated the world about the horror of nuclear
war,'' Ms. Rudin said after the ceremony.
   Outside, hundreds of Boy Scouts handed visitors fresh flowers
while protesters passed out leaflets accusing the government of
laxity in enforcing a policy against allowing U.S. and other
warships to bring nuclear weapons into Japan.
   Korean residents of Japan distributed pamphlets demanding that
the government apologize for Japan's aggression against other
Asians in World War II and other conflicts.
   In his annual peace declaration, Hiroshima Mayor Takeshi Araki
said ``the Cold War framework of East-West relations'' was being
replaced by ``a new order of international peace.''
   Araki, a survivor of the atomic attack and an anti-nuclear
activist, called on Japan to reduce its military spending and
pointed to progress in superpower arms control.
   In the Philippine capital of Manila, a left-wing group marked
the anniversary by calling for the end to nuclear weapons and
establishment of international nuclear-free zones.
   The group, the Society of Ex-Detainees for Liberation Against
Detention and for Amnesty, is made up of former political prisoners
under the government of Ferdinand Marcos.

<TEXT>
   Airlines are hiring record numbers of pilots,
raising concerns over safety and future shortages of men and women
to fly military and civilian planes.
   Large and small carriers have hired 12,000 pilots so far this
year, compared to 9,800 for all of last year, according to the Air
Line Pilots Association.
   But not all of the new hires are new pilots. Many are moving up
an informal ladder to flying the most sophisticated commercial
jets, resulting in an exodus among military pilots and turnover of
up to 120 percent a year for small carriers. Flight schools also
are seeing more trainers leave to enter the cockpit.
   The problem also has increased debate over the mandatory
retirement of commercial airline pilots at age 60, flight
experience requirements for pilots who fly passenger jets and the
loss of billions of dollars in training military pilots who quit to
join airlines that have no training programs of their own.
   ``The military and the regional airlines together continue to
supply a large share of the major airline pilot workforce, but they
cannot meet the present or future demand,'' said Henry A. Duffy,
president of the 41,000-member pilots union.
   Duffy and other aviation experts testified last week before the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee on
aviation, which is looking into the nation's pilot supply.
   Airline industry analysts estimate that between 40,000 and
60,000 new pilots will be needed over the next decade.
   Duffy said the military is losing 1,000 more pilots a year than
it trains.
   Karen Keesling, Air Force assistant secretary, said that if the
loss of trained military pilots is not stopped, the Air Force will
have a shortage of 2,800 pilots in five years and will lose several
billions of dollars in training.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., suggested that major airlines should
pay the cost of training military pilots who leave to fly passenger
planes. He also said the industry and the government should explore
the possibility of retaining older, experienced pilots who now have
to retire at 60.
   John S. Fredericksen of the Regional Airline Association said
that small carriers have to replace an average of 40 percent of
their pilots each year, with some having to replace all of them.
   ``All commuters enthusiastically seek out qualified pilots who
have no interest in a major airline career,'' he said, adding that
some companies are hiring pilots with relatively low total flying
time.
   Small carriers and charter airlines pay beginning flight crew
salaries as low as under $20,000 a year, while pilots for major
airlines can earn over $100,000.
   John D. Odegard, head of the University of North Dakota's
government-subsidized aerospace school which trains pilots, said
the need for pilots is ``staggering.''
   ``Massive pilot retirements, fewer ex-military pilots and
explosive industry growth _ growth which is expected to double to
one billion enplanements by the turn of the century'' are causing
the turnover and the threat of a pilot shortage, Odegard told
subcommittee.
   ``This turnover and its resulting decline in the relative
experience levels of pilots is beginning to raise serious questions
about maintaining air safety,'' Odegard said.
   He noted that young military pilots are put at the controls of
the world's most sophisticated jet aircraft after only 250 hours of
experience. Newly hired jetliner pilots averaged 1,500 hours last
year, but this was down from about 2,500 in 1981.
   Some aviation experts propose that performance levels rather
than flight experience should be the major factor in hiring.
   ``I believe a program of concentrated and professionally
structured training can be an effective substitute for in-flight
experience,'' said Kenneth L. Tallman, a retired Air Force general
who is president of the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in
Florida.
   Tallman said enrollments in pilot training programs are
approaching record levels, but after training a young pilot ``is
cast into the great unknown.''
   He said there is no structured path for a pilot to follow to a
job as airliner pilot. One young pilot, following a typical path,
worked flying banners, hauled night freight, carried daily
newspapers, and flew a commuter service to accumulate enough hours
to be hired by a major airline, he said.
   The nation needs a civilian flight training program backed by
the Federal Aviation Administration, Tallman said.

   More than a few eyebrows were raised at the
Natural Resources Defense Council when word filtered in that a book
detailing the activist environmental group's work was being peddled
for $1,500 a copy to big business.
   ``I find this a little odd,'' said Paul Allen, spokesman for the
council.
   A Washington consulting firm, Mongoven, Biscoe &amp; Duchin, mailed
solicitations to corporations last week offering a report on the
group, and promising information and analysis on its leaders,
issues and methods.
   Ronald A. Duchin, a veteran public relations executive who
formerly was a spokesman for the Pentagon, said all the information
is gleaned by his firm from public sources, such as newspapers,
annual reports and other publications.
   ``We don't monitor them because they're evil,'' he said. ``We
monitor them because our clients need information about what's on
their agenda.''
   Whatever the motivation, his firm is operating in a relatively
new and apparently growing area of research and management
consulting for corporate clients who want to know what
environmental or social activists are up to.
   The report was offered, Duchin's solicitation said, to
corporations that might be ``concerned with the NRDC's involvement
in environmental public policy issues.''
   Allen quickly learned of the report from friends who had been
offered the chance to buy it last week.
   He called the consulting firm to see what was going on. Duchin,
its senior vice president, brought over a free copy.
   The firm, established last year, offers what it describes as
``public policy intelligence'' on activists in environmental,
animal rights and consumer organizations, as well as citizens
groups, groups opposing biotechnology and even churches.
   ``MBD maintains extensive files on individuals and organizations
(all from public sources) and is able to provide timely information
and assessment of their activities and plans,'' the firm said in a
description Duchin mailed with the solicitation.
   Duchin said his firm is different from some others, however,
because it sticks to public sources of information and engages in
no spying, infiltration or corporate espionage.
   ``We monitor them. We make it our business to learn as much as
we can about them,'' Duchin said.
   The targets of their research generally would be described as
liberal, although Duchin said there was no intent to focus only on
the left.
   He said his firm has scrutinized national church organizations,
including the United Church of Christ and the United Methodist
Church, because of their support for animal rights' activists and
other activities.
   He said his clients include large chemical companies, but he
would not identify them. They pay monthly retainers of $3,500 to
$9,000 a month to be kept informed on certain issues and groups, he
said.
   The mailing on the NRDC went to 125 companies, he said. He
expects 20 or 25 to buy the one-time report and perhaps other
services. The report went free to regular clients.
   Allen says the Natural Resources Defense Council still is trying
to decide what to make of it, but ``there is something vaguely
sinister about it.''
   The report, he said, was generally flattering in describing the
group's effectiveness, although it misspelled the names of some
officials.
   He disagreed only on the report's conclusions that the group's
reputation had been damaged by the short-lived Alar scar, which was
triggered by the NRDC's report on the use of pesticides in apples.
   ``I guess I'm a little off put by the implication here that
there's something about us that needs to be revealed,'' Allen said.
``Do they have a right to do this? Sure, I suppose.''
   The council is a large environmentalist orgaization, more
establishment-minded than some other activist groups, and its
lawyers are engaged in litigation aimed at protecting the
environment.
   Allen said he saw no evidence there was anything other than
public sources used. Most of the information seemed to come from
the group's annual reports, he said.
   ``The price perplexes me more than anything else,'' Allen said.

   A few steps from the imposing Zurich

problem.
   Platzspitz park, once a favorite picnic spot, has become the
gathering point for drug addicts in this country, one of the
world's wealthiest, which has virtually no unemployment but one of
the highest drug addiction rates in the world.
   Most tourists, admiring Alpine views and shopping for watches or
chocolate, are unaware of the problem. And many Swiss failed for
years to grasp its size.
   But a recent killing in Platzspitz shocked the country. An
addict was tied up, gagged and drowned following an argument over a
piece of chocolate.
   ``What's wrong with Switzerland? Are we too well-off? Have our
young people really lost all sense of where they are going?'' said
Blick, the country's top-circulation tabloid.
   In 1988, there were 205 drug deaths in Switzerland. Figures for
the first half of this year suggest a sharp increase.
   Neighboring West Germany, with a population 10 times that of
Switzerland's 6.5 million, had only three times as many
drug-related deaths.
   In searching for solutions, an independent commission set up by
the Swiss government has recommended legalizing possession and
consumption of small amounts of drugs.
   ``Punishing addicts for harming their health does not achieve
anything. They need help,'' commission president Francois von der
Linde said in a recent interview.
   But he said suggestions to relax drug laws find little support
in other countries. The Swiss government has yet to reply to the
recommendations, but Arthur Grob of the Zurich police narcotics
department dismissed them as ``impossible and unworkable.''
   The Swiss Justice Ministry says most drugs smuggled into
Switzerland are heroin from Turkey and cocaine from South America.
   Dr. Werner Fuchs of the Zurich AIDS Intervention Project is
pessimistic.
   ``There is no solution to the drug problem,'' he told The
Associated Press. Instead, he said, officials should work on
containing the spread of the AIDS virus among Switzerland's 10,000
to 15,000 heroin addicts.
   Switzerland has the highest AIDS rate in Europe with 122.1 cases
per million people, ahead of France with 115.3, according to the
World Health Organization. Nearly a third of the 806 AIDS cases
reported in Switzerland by March were intravenous drug users. Half
of the 806 victims were homosexual or bisexual males.
   Fuchs works with doctors, nurses, social workers and volunteers
who operate 16 hours a day at Platzspitz. They provide needles,
free AIDS tests, meals, washing facilities and advice to those who
will listen.
   Zurich city councilors have authorized the free distribution of
syringes in the park to counter the spread of AIDS. Fuchs says when
the weather is fine, his team hands out as many as 5,000 new
syringes a day in exchange for used ones.
   Park benches are filled with young people. Some are asleep, some
stare vacantly into space, others inject heroin. No one bothers
about onlookers. A young girl wanders around eating a piece of
cake. Her face is covered with boils, her arms and legs are scarred
with the marks of drug abuse.
   Around a fountain at the park's center stand a few tables,
makeshift bases for the dealers. Nearby are two huge garbage
containers filled with empty soda cans, beer bottles and thousands
of syringe wrappers.
   Grob claims Platzspitz encourages addiction and acts as a magnet
to people because they know they can get food, syringes and medical
care.
   The square's population can reach 500 on weekends.
   Martin, a self-described volunteer who refused to give his last
name, is scornful of passers-by and tourists who regard the addicts
as freaks.
   ``The other day a busload of Japanese tourists stopped near the
park. They all got out and took photos of us, as if we were caged
zoo animals,'' he said.
   A barber by training, Martin offers haircuts and tints for $3
and entertains the crowd with an accordion.
   Though violence is not uncommon in the drug scene, even police
were shocked when the bound and gagged body of 23-year-old addict
Rolf von Arx was fished out of the river flowing by the park. His
two attackers admitted he was still alive when they tossed him into
the water after an argument over a bar of chocolate and a spilled
drink.
   Local magistrate Helene Wormser told journalists, ``Platzspitz
has seen fights and shootings but no one before has thought of
drowning a fellow human like a cat.''

<TEXT>
   ``Bouncin' with Bud,'' an evening of music by
the pianist Bud Powell, which built from the ethereal to the fast
and furious, was a delightful revelation.
   Saturday night's concert at Alice Tully Hall was the second of
six in this season's Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center series.
   The evening was all music, without spoken information about
Powell, the most important piano architect of early bebop. Powell
died at 41 in 1966. Judging from the enthusiam of the audience,
they knew all about Powell and were thrilled to be hearing his
infrequently played compositions. Anybody present who didn't know
Powell's music was shown a new and wide world of music.
   The evening began with two tunes played by pianist Barry Harris,
who is the foremost player of the music of Thelonious Monk, Tadd
Dameron and Powell. ``Oblivion'' and ``Dusk in Saudi'' were
introspective, as delicate as a daydream wafting through blue
skies, ruminations on emotions long since calmed.
   Then pianist Tommy Flanagan, whose graceful but authoritative
style was influenced by Powell, came on to play a brief set, the
lilting ``Celia,'' fast, cheery and emphatic ``So Sorry Please''
and ``Bouncin' with Bud,'' where long phrases, which make one smile
with their joy, revealed Powell's amazing melodic gift.
   Pianist Walter Davis Jr. played the percussive solo ``Glass
Enclosure,'' which shows Powell's classical training. Both the
writing and playing style evoked stern, angry 20th-century Russian
composers.
   Davis introduced alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and said proudly
that Powell called them his disciples. They played ``I'll Keep
Loving You,'' where the piano plays background chords. Then they
were joined by bassist Ray Drummond and drummer Kenny Washington
for ``Bud's Sure Thing,'' with scorching solos for everybody.
   Powell intended to write for a band but never did so Davis,
trombonist Slide Hampton and tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath arranged
two tunes each _ bright, brassy and beautiful _ for a distinguished
10-piece band for this concert.
   Players were trumpeters Art Farmer and Earl Gardner, Hampton,
French horn player John Clark, tuba player Bob Stewart, McLean,
Heath, Drummond and Washington, with Harris and Davis taking turns
on piano.
   They played the spinning ``Parisien Thoroughfare''; ``Strictly
Confidential''; ``Hallucination,'' roiling with inner rhythms then
sliding into dissonance; ``Time Waits,'' with its slow, sad
introduction leading into milder dissonance; ``Dance of the
Infidels,'' with solos for French horn, trombone and tuba, and
``Tempis Fugit,'' full of urgent jazz spirit and feel.
   Harris forgot his reading glasses and was loaned a pair by a man
in the front row.
   The eminently solid concert ended with more audience
participation _ a standing ovation.

<HEAD>Many Farmers Still Sweating Out Drought, But Conditions Better Than
1988</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Parts of the Midwest remain in the grip
of extreme drought, but timely rains have kept fields green in much
of the nation's grain belt even if little or none of the moisture
is being stored in the soil.
   ``This is our second year living from rain shower to rain
shower. Our whole family financial condition rests on the next
rain,'' said Mark Nagle, who raises corn and soybeans eight miles
southwest of Mason City in north central Iowa. ``You kind of wonder
how long it can go.''
   Extreme drought lingers in most of Iowa and North Dakota and in
parts of Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
South Dakota and Wisconsin, according to the National Weather
Service. That's according to a weather service index that takes
into consideration soil conditions and long-term precipitation.
   ``The bullseye seems to be in Iowa,'' said Wayne Ellingson of
the weather service's Des Moines office.
   Drought disasters were declared this summer for North Dakota and
half the counties of South Dakota. In April, an emergency
proclamation was issued by Iowa's governor so the National Guard
could help haul water to communities in six southern counties.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the drought of 1988 has never
ended,'' said John Enz, North Dakota's state climatologist.
   Even if the heavier-than-normal rain predicted for the next 90
days over part of the grain belt actually falls, it will take 18
months to two years for groundwater to be replenished in the
central Plains, said Norton Strommen, a weather expert at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture in Washington.
   ``We've got a long way to go,'' said Strommen, chief
meteorologist at the USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board.
   In Iowa, statewide average rainfall totaled just 13.65 inches in
the first seven months of the year. That was only 69 percent of the
normal 19.67 inches and made it the eighth driest
January-through-July period in records that go back 117 years.
   That was far better than the 9.74 inches of rain _ less than
half the norm _received during the first seven months of last year,
the driest on record. But it still created plenty of problems for
farmers.
   Phil Kruse, another Iowa farmer, said that up to last week, rain
had missed his farm and corn leaves were turning pale and curling
up to preserve moisture. ``We've had dry spells, but nothing like
this,'' said Kruse, who grows corn, soybeans, oats and hay and has
a dairy herd near Waucoma in northeast Iowa.
   Last year, drought reduced his corn yields to about a third of
normal and his soybean harvest to around half normal. He got by
with drought assistance, reserve hay and proceeds from hog
operations that have since been discontinued.
   But Friday night, 1{ inches of rain fell on the farm and by
Saturday, ``everything started looking greener,'' said Kruse's
wife, Rosemary.
   ``Boy, was that nice,'' she said. ``He looked at the rain gauge
a couple of times and had me look at it. He didn't believe it.''
   Even with the increased rain, only 1 percent of Iowa's subsoil _
its reserves for plant growth in dry periods _ is deemed to have
adequate moisture.
   Ohio and Indiana, where crops shriveled last summer, had so much
rain this spring that planting was delayed. As a result,
pollination now is running behind schedule, leaving those crops
vulnerable if hit by a blast of hot weather this month, said Larry
Van Mier of the USDA's Economic Research Service in Washington.
   But crops still are flourishing in most fields, even though soil
moisture reserves are low.
   Kansas is rebounding from a drought earlier this year that cut
the winter wheat crop to its smallest in 23 years. More than half
of Kansas corn and soybeans are rated in excellent condition this
summer and more than 60 percent of the subsoil has adequate
moisture.
   Van Mier said it appears that among the 17 states that account
for 94 percent of the nation's corn production, yields this year
will be far better than 1988, when they averaged about 82 bushels
an acre. With normal rains through fall harvest, yields should rise
above 118 bushels an acre but not quite to the 119.6-bushel level
of 1987, he said.
   Nagle, the Iowa farmer, knows first hand the importance of
getting rain at the right time.
   That's what salvaged a normal harvest for his farm in 1988, when
blistering heat and extreme drought fried crops in the field
throughout much of the Midwest.
   ``This year, with timely rains, we'll have another normal
harvest,'' he said. ``You dodge the bullet so often you think
you're immune.''

<HEAD>Company Linked to Dixon's Wife Emerges as Big-League Lobbying Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A company that acquires lucrative franchises
for airport duty-free stores has become a big-league lobbying force
in Washington, trying to curry favor with House ethics committee
chairman Julian Dixon and others.
   Dixon's wife, Betty, has a stake in a high-yielding joint
venture with Duty Free Shoppers Group Ltd. to run the duty-free
shops at the Los Angeles International Airport.
   The Dixons acknowledge on financial disclosure reports that they
have made at least $150,000 in two years off an initial investment
of $15,000 or less.
   Extensive activity by lobbyists from Patton Boggs &amp; Blow, a law
firm hired by the San Francisco-based company, is outlined in
papers on file with the Justice Department's Office of Foreign
Agents Registration.
   Duty Free Shoppers is one of more than 100 clients represented
by Patton Boggs, a high-powered firm that bears the name of Tommy
Boggs, son of Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La.
   Many of the firm's clients are giants in their fields: Sony
Corp. of America; May Department Stores; MCI Telecommunications, to
name a few.
   But the Duty Free Shoppers' account also kept the lobbyists
busy, and Boggs personally handled many of the contacts, according
to interviews and documents.
   The company paid Patton Boggs more than $1.4 million in the
four-year period through 1988, a fee viewed as substantial by other
Washington lobbyists. ``That's a nice-sized account,'' said Edward
Van Kloberg, a lobbyist with a number of foreign clients.
   The documents paint a picture of Patton Boggs' staff frequently
on the telephone or in meetings with legislators, their staffs and
executive branch officials from the Customs Service and the
departments of Transportation or Commerce, agencies that have roles
in regulating duty-free shops at airports.
   Besides Dixon, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee; House Ways and Means Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., Sens. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, and Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, are among the
scores of capital power players contacted on behalf of Duty Free
Shoppers, the reports show.
   ``They were pretty good lobbyists for anybody they had,'' former
Rep. Cecil Heftel, D-Hawaii, said of Patton Boggs.
   ``They knew how to deal with the facts but in a way that was
favorable to their client,'' said Heftel, who left office in 1986
to run unsuccessfully for governor in his home state.
   Although Heftel said he routinely declined social functions paid
for by lobbyists, others didn't.
   In 1985, for instance, the lobbyists charged Duty Free Shoppers
$1,480 for a dinner for Inouye, the documents show.
   Henry Giugni, Inouye's former administrative assistant and now
the Senate sergeant at arms, ``was the only other government
official who attended Sen. Inouye's dinner,'' the documents show.
   On another occasion, March 11, 1986, Ronald H. Brown, a lawyer
for Patton Boggs and now the chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, bought dinner for Dixon, D-Calif., and two other friends.
   Dixon, who says he never talked about Duty Free Shoppers with
Brown, recalled that there was a ``brief `struggle' concerning the
$187 bill after dinner. ``Ron insisted he treat and did so.''
   Brown said two other contacts he listed with Dixon on behalf of
Duty Free Shoppers were ``mostly social occasions ... three of the
occasions were dinners.''
   It was at one of those events _ a Feb. 26, 1986 party thrown by
Patton Boggs _ that Betty Dixon apparently learned about the Duty
Free Shoppers ``investment possibility,'' Dixon said.
   On the same day, Patton Boggs officials reported lobbying Reps.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Don Young, R-Alaska, Daniel Akaka,
D-Hawaii, Heftel and Stevens for Duty Free Shoppers.
   Stuart Pape, one of the lawyers who handled Duty Free Shoppers'
business, said it ``wouldn't be uncommon to lobby'' a variety of
lawmakers ``if you judged that he would be important or
sympathetic, or, indeed, antagonistic.''
   Boggs did not return telephone calls to talk about the business.
   Patton Boggs dealt with ``legislation relating to duty-free
bonded warehouses, U.S. Pacific trust territory relationships, tax
and other revenue matters,'' according to legislative reports filed
with the House.
   Duty Free Shoppers, incorporated in Bermuda, is a worldwide
operation with concessions to operate shops at airports in
Honolulu; San Francisco;, Anchorage, Alaska; and Boston, Mass.,
among other places.
   It has sales of over $1 billion annually, mostly from selling
high-priced goods like perfume and brandname items such as Hermes
ties and Gucci shoes to international travelers.
   Besides hiring Patton Boggs, Duty Free Shoppers is a member of
the International Association of Airport Duty Free Stores, a trade
association with about 50 members.
   David H. Bernstein, the association's president, said the
industry grew up in the 1950s to serve travelers who can avoid
duties on items they purchase for consumption outside the United
States.
   The more than 125 duty free stores nationwide generate about $1
billion in revenues, with some of that money going to subsidize
airports.
   ``Duty free sales enterprises benefit the United States in a
number of ways,'' Akaka said in a statement. Not only do they pay
concession fees to airports, they ``induce foreign visitors to
increase their overall expenditures in the United States,'' the
congressman from Hawaii said.
   In 1986, Akaka introduced legislation that established
guidelines for duty-free stores, including where they can be
located. The measure was incorporated in the 1988 omnibus trade
bill.

   An estranged couple's fight over the
fate of seven fertilized human eggs goes to court Monday and may
provide a legal precedent in cases where technology has bent the
traditional course of parenthood.
   Junior Lewis Davis is seeking to prevent his wife, Mary Sue
Davis, from attempting to become pregnant with any of the eggs now
that they are getting divorced. Davis, who filed for divorce in
February, says he no longer wants to have a child with her.
   The eggs were taken from Mrs. Davis and fertilized with Davis'
sperm in an in-vitro fertilization program the couple entered at a
Knoxville hospital six years ago in hopes of having a so-called
``test-tube baby.''
   ``I consider them life,'' Mrs. Davis, 28, said shortly after her
husband filed for divorce. She has said that the eggs are the
result of years of surgery, tests and self-administered injections
and are her best chance at having a child. ``I would love to be a
mother,'' she said.
   She also said she would consider raising the child by herself
and not asking for child support.
   Davis, 30, countered at the time that it would be unsettling
``to know that ... 10 years from now I could be walking down the
street and bump into my child and not know it.''
   In-vitro fertilization was first used successfully in 1978 with
the birth in England of Louise Brown. Eggs are surgically removed
from a woman's ovary and combined with sperm in the laboratory. The
resulting fertilized egg is then implanted in the woman's uterus in
hopes a normal pregnancy will result; other fertilized eggs can be
frozen for later attempts.
   Mrs. Davis says she had five tubal pregnancies after the couple
was married in 1979, one resulting in a ruptured fallopian tube.
Surgery was done to tie the other tube before the Davises entered
the in-vitro program administered by Dr. I. Ray King.
   There were originally nine fertilized eggs; two were
unsuccessfully implanted before the couple's marriage broke down.
   The Davises did not sign a contract specifying what should be
done with the embryos if circumstances changed such as a divorce,
or the death of one or both of them. King says that was an
oversight, but he added that any such agreement probably could be
contested in court anyway.
   But the lack of a contract leaves Blount County District Court
Judge W. Dale Young with no prior agreement on which to base his
decision, and with little legal guidance. Attorneys for both
parties said in briefs there was no legal precedent they could cite
to help guide Young's decision.
   ``There is no legal precedent that says very early embryos are
legal persons with rights,'' said John A. Robertson, a law
professor at the University of Texas. ``The state (of Tennessee)
could choose to protect them if it wished, but the state hasn't
done that.''
   The only state to take such action is believed to be Louisiana,
which has a law saying embryos are entitled to the full protection
of the law and cannot be owned or destroyed.
   In the Tennessee case, Charles Clifford, Davis' attorney, argues
that the embryos are joint property and can be disposed of like
other assets in a divorce. Giving Mrs. Davis sole discretion over
the embryos would deprive Davis of the right to decide whether to
sire offspring, the lawyer argued.
   Jay Christenberry, attorney for Mrs. Davis, argues that Davis is
trying to reverse a condition as old as Adam and Eve _ it has
never, he says, been within the man's power to cancel a pregnancy
once an egg has been fertilized.
   These embryos are in cold storage, not in Mrs. Davis' body. But
even in so primitive a form, with only four to eight cells, they
represent potential life, Mrs. Davis' attorney said.
   Robertson, who has written articles on the legal and ethical
aspects of in-vitro fertilization and the rights of embryos, is
expected to be called as a witness by Davis' attorney. He argues
that the case should be decided in favor of the person who would be
hurt worse by losing, which he says is Davis.
   ``It would seem that the party who wished to avoid parenthood
would be hurt worse if the embryos were used,'' he said. ``The
other parent can go out and create new embryo and try to have
children.''
   However, Mrs. Davis' chances of trying further in-vitro
fertilization could depend on her remarrying. Chicago attorney Lori
B. Andrews, a specialist in reproductive technology law, said she
knows of no in-vitro fertilization clinic that will take a single
woman as a patient.

   When ``Bright Eyes'' and ``Sally''
advertise in the personals they intend to teach their respondents a
thing or two.
   Only their lessons are in the classroom.
   The fictitious women and their ads are part of Daytona Beach
Community College's unconventional attempt to recruit students
through the personals column.
   ``Single woman looking for intellectual man to discuss English
literature, philosophies of the Western World and to take some
classes of mutual interest at Daytona Beach Community College.
Signed, Bright Eyes,'' reads one ad.
   Others suggest ongoing interludes.
   The school ran an ad on Aug. 1 addressed to Virgil. ``It's
awfully hot in my house,'' it read. ``If you'll fix my air
conditioning, I'll let you take me to the movies. Signed, Sally.''
   The next day, there was a reply: ``Sally, I can fix your air
conditioning with the training I received at DBCC's School of
Technologies. And thanks to the job I got after graduation, I can
afford to take you to the movies. Signed, Virgil.''
   Lee Lapensohn, director of marketing at the college, said the
2-week-old ad campaign is intended to be a friendly and upbeat
method of sparking interest in the college.
   ``We think quality education at DBCC is a highly personal
thing,'' he said. ``We want them to think of us with a smile.''

marketing at this time,'' said Mary Booker, coordinator of media

   New Mexico National Guard Lt. Col. Danny D.
Isaacs of Santa Fe arrived here with blistered feet, weary legs and
a happy heart.
   Isaacs walked from Santa Fe to Roswell to pay off a bet with
officers at the 1st Chaparral Missile Battalion in Roswell. He
started his trek 6 a.m. Monday and finished 200 miles later at
10:45 a.m. Saturday.
   ``It was a nice walk. I got to see New Mexico up close real
slow,'' he said as he rested. ``It was really nice in the early
morning, but it got pretty hot in the afternoon. That was
drudgery.''
   Isaacs, director of personnel and administration for the Guard's
headquarters, wagered the officers in August 1988 that the
battalion couldn't increase its numbers.
   Isaacs lost the bet when the battalion added 84 people in a
year, well over the goal set in the bet, Maj. Mike Gonzales said.
Isaacs hurt his own cause by recruiting four people.
   Gonzales said everyone was a winner because the battalion
improved its strength and the Guard received a lot of positive
publicity.

<HEAD>Americans Spend Less Than 12 Cents of Their Dollar on Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are spending a smaller share of
their incomes on food than ever before, the Agriculture Department
says.
   According to the department's food cost review, Americans
overall spent $411 billion on food in 1988 _ 11.8 percent of their
total disposable personal income.
   That is down from 13 percent five years earlier and 13.5 percent
in 1978, the department's Economic Research Service says. When the
government began keeping statistics in 1929, nearly 25 percent of
disposable personal income was spent on food.
   That percentage has declined steadily over the years except for
the 1970s, when there was relatively high food price inflation, the
department says.
   Citing a 1986 survey by the U.S. Department of Labor, the
Agriculture department noted that the percentage of income spent on
food varies by size and income of family.
   After-tax income spent for food varied from 12.7 percent for
households with incomes of $30,000-$39,000, to 27.4 percent for
families with incomes of $5,000-$9,999.
   Although much has been said about the growing number of meals
taken at restaurants and fast-food establishments, the share of
disposable income on food eaten away from home has risen only
gradually: from 3.2 percent in 1929 to 4.5 percent in 1988.
Expense-account meals are excluded.
   The Agriculture Department excludes pet food, ice and prepared
feeds, and deducts more for nonfood items such as drugs and
household supplies in arriving at the food component of grocery
bills.
   The declining percentage of food expenditures in relation to
rising income was noted by 19th century economist Ernest Engel, the
report says.
   ``A decline in this percentage reflects a highly developed
economy in which there is money to spend on personal services and
other discretionary items,'' the report says. ``Some of these
additional services ordinarily are purchases along with food. This
reasoning largely explains the slight increase in the percentage of
income spent on food away from home.''
   So, how did farmers make out?
   Of the $411 billion spent on food, $395 billion was spent on
food produced on American farms. The rest was spent on imported
food and fishery products.
   The $395 billion represents a 5 percent increase over the
previous year and is a record dollar amount spent by consumers on
food produced in America.
   Meat products accounted for 29 percent of total expenditures,
followed by 22 percent for fruits and vegetables.

   Northeastern floods have stranded at
least 300,000 people, and most of them face shortages of food and
clean drinking water, officials said Sunday.
   The Flood Control Center in Dhaka said at least five more people
had drowned Saturday, raising the death toll from two weeks of
torrential rains to 155. The rains ended Thursday.
   During the downpours, rivers in five districts burst embankments
and washed away thousands of mud-and-straw houses, officials said.
   The are hit hardest was Sylhet district, where 45,000 acres of
crops were damaged and at least 100 cattle killed, said Tapan
Barua, a district official who spoke by telephone from Zakiganj.
The town is 120 miles northeast of Dhaka.
   Most marooned people were living on roofs and makeshift bamboo
platforms or in local schools, officials said.
   State-run television said Sunday that most areas in Sylhet
district were under three feet of water.
   Roads and train tracks remained blocked for the third day
Sunday. Officials said service was not likely to be restored until
Thursday.
   The government said Saturday it had begun rescue and relief. It
said it sent 12 medical teams to Zakiganj, which was threatened
with an outbreak of diarrhea.
   A Relief Ministry official said Saturday that 10 people had died
of diarrhea, caused by dirty drinking water.
   Flooding occurs each year in this impoverished nation of 110
million people. More than 1,400 people were killed last year in
floods that submerged three-fourths of the country.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Called Threat to Minority Rights</HEAD>
<HEAD>For release at 6 p.m. EDT - time set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Urban League opened its annual
conference Sunday with a call for Congress and President Bush to
roll back recent Supreme Court decisions that it said were
anti-civil rights.
   League President John E. Jacob said that without action to
reverse the high court's rulings, women and minorities ``won't be
allowed to play catchup. They'll be stuck with the effects of past
discrimination.''
   ``The court we once looked to as the protector of minority
rights has itself become a threat to our rights,'' he said.
   Jacob, in a keynote address to the conference, cited recent
court rulings: against contracts set aside for minority businesses,
preventing women and minorities from challenging standing seniority
systems, limiting the use of statistics in proving patterns of
discrimination and putting greater burdens of proof on victims of
discrimination.
   ``We call on the president and the Congress to carefully review
the court's anti-civil rights decisions and to frame corrective
legislation,'' Jacob said.
   Jacob also announced two new Urban League programs to provide
more minority workers with jobs and to combat drugs in the
community.
   The National Workforce Development Program is designed to help
workers get the training and counseling they need to obtain jobs
and to help link them up with employers who are searching for
qualified people.
   ``We will be able to help corporate America include minorities
in all of its operations _ from the factory floor to the executive
suites,'' Jacob said.
   The league also said it plans to push for tougher laws against
drug offenses and for prison sites that keep offenders out of
communities. It said it will organize a nationwide ``Blacks Against
Drugs'' movement to mobilize people against drugs and keep children
drug-free.

<HEAD>Khamenei Confirmed as Iran's ``Leader''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICK LUDINGTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of jurists and religious figures
on Sunday confirmed Ali Khamenei to succeed the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini as leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the
official news agency reported.
   As leader, Khamenei has the power to dismiss the president,
declare war, and appoint major officials including military and
religious leaders. He also serves as commander in chief of the
armed forces.
   Spiritually, he is standing in for the ``hidden'' imam, or 12th
religious leader of the dominant Shiite Moslem sect in Iran.
Shiites believe he disappeared in the 10th century A.D. and is
supposed to return to create a perfect world.
   But Khamenei, 50, a soft-spoken, self-effacing man, is unlikely
to wield the influence of Khomeini, who founded the Islamic
republic in 1979 and was revered as a prophet by millions of
Iranians.
   Khamenei has been serving as president, and his term officially
ends Oct. 9.
   On June 4, a day after the death of Khomeini, the 83-man
Assembly of Experts provisionally elected him to succeed Khomeini
as spiritual leader of Iran, in line with Khomeini's wishes.
   However, official confirmation had to await a referendum July
28, held along with presidential elections, which put a number of
constitutional changes to the vote.
   The changes included abolishing the post of prime minister,
strengthening the role of the president and allowing the ``leader''
to be chosen from among the second rank of Moslem clergymen,
``mujtahid'' or Islamic jurists, instead of only the first rank of
``marja'' or paramount Islamic clergy.
   Khamenei is a mujtahid.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Khomeini,
``citing problems in finding a marja who was also aware of
political issues necessary for running a state, had urged the
amendment shortly before his death.''
   In the election, the changes were approved by 97 percent of the
vote. The parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, was elected
president with 95 percent. Rafsanjani also is deputy speaker of the
Assembly of Experts, the country's highest spiritual body.
   Although Rafsanjani will be outranked by Khamenei, he will
control the executive machinery of the government. The two men are
believed to get along well.
   Meanwhile, the interior minister, Ali Akbar Mohtashemi,
announced that Rafsanjani cannot take over the presidency before
Oct. 9 unless Khamenei officially resigns.
   Rafsanjani was reported inaugurated as president by IRNA last
Thursday. But IRNA quoted Mohtashemi as saying, ``Legally his
excellency Ayatollah Khamenei is the president until the end of his
term on Oct. 9.''
   Mohtashemi is a hard-liner believed to be at odds with
Rafsanjani, who has shown willingness to end Iran's international
isolation and moderate its foreign activities and image.
   It was unclear whether Sunday's statement by Mohtashemi was an
attempt to make trouble for Rafsanjani, who most observers assumed
had officially taken over the presidency.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Confrontation Helped Inspire Little-Noticed Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little-noticed effort to freeze housing
funds to communities guilty of police brutality was inspired partly
by complaints from anti-abortion demonstrators in Pittsburgh, says
the measure's sponsor.
   The freeze amendment by Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., was quietly
tacked on to a Department of Housing and Urban Development
appropriations bill July 20 by voice vote.
   The amendment would bar municipalities from spending Community
Development Block Grants if three or more of their police officers
were convicted of using unnecessary force against peaceful
demonstrators.
   Not only would the freeze require a conviction, it would be
triggered only if it was determined the officers acted ``on orders
of superiors.''
   In an interview Friday, Walker said the amendment was inspired
partly by a March 11 demonstration in which several protesters from
the anti-abortion group ``Operation Rescue'' claimed they were
brutalized by police and county jail guards.
   No charges have been filed, but the U.S. Civil Rights Commission
has said it will look into the incident.
   Walker said he hoped the amendment, which cannot become law
without Senate concurrence, will get the attention of Pittsburgh
officials.
   ``To suggest Pittsburgh was the only reason for this is to
misrepresent the situation,'' Walker said. ``No doubt it would
apply to Operation Rescue, and they were fully supportive of the
amendment. But the amendment speaks about civil rights
demonstrators in general, and is particularly aimed at a policy in
some communities of using pain as a way of handling nonviolent
demonstrations.''
   The only House member to argue against the amendment on the
floor was Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., who said it was confusing and
would set a bad precedent.
   Green said he was concerned about what would happen if, for
example, ``someone comes up to the secretary of HUD as he is
entering the HUD building and says, `Psst, buddy, three police
officers in Altoona have been convicted under the circumstances of
the Walker amendment.'
   ``At that point, the secretary must withhold funds from Altoona,
and I think it is a dangerous amendment, a dangerous precedent,''
Green said.
   Pittsburgh officials have been lobbying against the amendment,
which they term ``ambiguous.''
   ``We can understand the desire of a member of Congress to insure
the right of any citizen to peacefully protest perceived
injustice,'' said a July 31 letter to Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., from
Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie Masloff and Tom Foerster, chairman of the
Allegheny County commissioners.
   ``However, there are any number of remedies in both federal and
state agencies available to a citizen who feels that unnecessary
violence was used against him or her. It is unfair to burden
Pittsburgh or other cities and municipalities with the potential of
losing these vital federal funds.''

<HEAD>Shocked by Stabbing, State Weighs Tighter Security at Mental Hospitals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was like something in a horror movie
_ 9-year-old Jessica Short was visiting a street festival when she
was grabbed suddenly from behind and stabbed to death by an escaped
mental patient as her mother and dozens of others watched.
   A week later, the story still haunts Connecticut, kept on
newspapers' front pages by a second escape from the same hospital
and by troubling questions about security at the state's mental
institutions.
   Mental health officials, who at first protested that they were
running hospitals, not prisons, have now moved to tighten security
around the state's small population of criminally insane mental
patients.
   But the new security has done little to comfort residents and
officials in Middletown, who have lived for years in an uneasy
peace with Connecticut Valley Hospital, a 120-year-old brick
complex that houses many of the state's 172 criminally insane
patients.
   ``People who walk with their children on Main Street in
Middletown hold their children closer now because of the
incident,'' said Mayor Sebastian Garafalo.
   On July 28, David Peterson, a paranoid schizophrenic, walked
away from the hospital where he was confined last year after
attacking a neighbor. He stabbed Jessica to death, apparently
choosing her at random from among fairgoers on a crowded sidewalk.
   ``I absolutely blame the hospital,'' said Vincent Amato, a
Middletown merchant. ``Who else could you blame? They were charged
by society to take care of this man who had a problem. They
failed.''
   Some mental health workers worry the incident has bred what one
official called ``a kind of hysteria'' against thousands of
harmless mentally ill people.
   ``They are not a danger to anyone. But the public puts all of
them in the same category _ that they are to be feared,'' said Edna
Jacobs, president of the Connecticut Alliance for the Mentally Ill.
``The public doesn't understand the nature of mental illness.''
   She worried that backlash from the killing could slow or even
reverse the state's efforts to make mental health treatment more
humane.
   Peterson, 37, was sent to the state mental hospital system in
February 1988 by a Superior Court judge who found him not guilty by
reason of insanity in the non-fatal stabbing of a neighbor. He was
being treated under minimal security at Merrit Hall, a section of
Connecticut Valley Hospital where patients are given certain
privileges based on their competence and behavior.
   At about noon the day of the stabbing, Peterson got permission
to go to the hospital library, but instead left the unlocked
building and walked off the hospital grounds unnoticed, according
to police and hospital officials.
   He took a bus downtown, where he bought a hunting knife for
$36.95 and blended into a crowd of hundreds at the street fair.
   Just before 3 p.m., he grabbed Jessica in front of an F.W.
Woolworth store and began stabbing her in the face and chest. The
attack lasted less than a minute. The dark-haired girl was dead a
half-hour later.
   Peterson, who is charged with murder, is now being held in a
maximum-security section of the Middletown hospital.
   Peterson's relatives guessed he may have acted out of rage at
his doctors. Through years of treatment for mental illness, the
family said, he has distrusted doctors and feared the medication
they prescribed would give him cancer. They also said he should
have been watched more closely.
   ``My brother should have been locked up,'' said his sister,
Diane Maynard. ``They should lock him up and throw away the key.
Something always happens.''
   The victim's family, aside from a brief statement thanking
people for their compassion, hasn't commented publicly on the case.
   The decision to put Peterson into a relatively free section of
the hospital complex had been made by the state's Psychiatric
Security Review Board, a 5-year-old panel created to ensure that
decisions about criminally insane patients are not based on a
single doctor's recommendation.
   Since the attack, the Department of Mental Health has ordered
tighter security, including locked doors, at all wards where
criminally insane patients are treated. The system of privileges is
under scrutiny; sweeping regulatory or legislative changes are
expected.
   ``No system will ever be mistake-free,'' said Paul Gionfriddo, a
state representative from Middletown. ``When a mistake happens _
and we had a tragic one a week ago _ you try to create a system
that is one step better than the one you had before.''
   Garafalo, the Middletown mayor, has suggested that patients with
criminal histories be forced to wear electronic tracking bracelets.
   ``The statement has been made that (the mental hospital) is not
a prison, it's a hospital,'' Garafalo said. ``Well, for those who
are criminally committed, it should be a prison, with treatment.''

   Rock 'n' roll star Rod Stewart headlined a benefit
for the American Cancer Society in honor of Canadian Terry Fox, an
amputee who died after trying to run across Canada to raise
awareness for cancer.
   Betty Fox flew from Vancouver to attend the Saturday event, and
said it was a continuation of her son's wish to help stop the
suffering of cancer victims.
   ``He was very strong and very compassionate. He loved a
challenge,'' Mrs. Fox said. ``When he took sick with cancer, he
said it was not going to ruin his life, and he set out to
accomplish his dreams.''
   Fox lost a leg to cancer when he was 18. Fitted with an
artifical limb, he ran 3,339 miles from St. John's New Foundland to
northern Ontario in 144 days. But his cross-country journey to
raise awareness for cancer was cut short Sept. 1, 1980, when the
pain from his spreading cancer became unbearable. He died in June
1981 at the age of 22.
   In addition to Stewart's performance, the concert featured a
music video of Fox' story set to a song written in his honor by
Stewart, entitled ``Never Give up on a Dream.'' The concert was
expected to raise about $175,000, organizers said.

   CBS-TV has ordered up a script for a
television pilot and possible series based on Mills lane, the
Washoe County prosecutor who has also served as a pro boxing
referee.
   Don Dunaway, an executive producer with Warner Bros., pitched
the idea to CBS and the network said Friday it wants the script.
   ``I think it's great,'' Lane said. ``I mean I'm excited about
it. I'm flattered. Let's get it on!''
   Warner Bros. paid Lane $5,000 last month for a one-year option
on the district attorney's life story.
   If the show ends up being a series, it would be about a
crusading district attorney and probably would feature Lane's
experiences refereeing major professional boxing matches, a Warner
Bros. spokesman said.
   The show might be set in a city similar to Reno with mountainous
surroundings and gambling, but with a larger population, the
spokesman added.
   Asked about his preference of actors to portray him in a pilot,
Lane said he'd go for Robert Duvall because people have said they
resemble each other.

   Space shuttle managers Sunday
pronouced Columbia ready for flight and directed a hush-hush
countdown to continue toward a Tuesday launch with five astronauts
and a secret military satellite.
   The go-ahead followed a three-hour readiness review of all
aspects of the mission, including the orbiter, weather and the
global tracking network. NASA administrator Richard Truly sat in on
the mission management team review.
   ``There are no open items and there is nothing now that will
hold up the launch,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said after the
meeting of launch officials.
   Because the mission is classified, the space agency remained
silent on the exact status of the countdown. It has said only that
liftoff is scheduled between 7:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   There also will be a news blackout throughout the flight on what
the astronauts are doing.
   ``The Defense Department has determined that the longer we can
keep the the launch time and the type of payload under wraps, the
less chance anyone has of tracking it and learning what it is,''
said Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman.
   Published reports and sources who requested anonymity have said
the astronauts will launch a sophisticated reconnaissance satellite
to gather intelligence data over much of the Soviet Union, China,
the Middle East and other areas of the globe of military interest.
   Warren said the only weather concern for Tuesday was the
possibility of clouds lingering in the area from overnight
thunderstorms. He said there was a 20 percent to 40 percent chance
that bad weather could interrupt launch preparations.
   The astronauts, all military officers, awakened early Sunday and
were examined by doctors. By dawn, Air Force Col. Brewster Shaw,
the mission commander, and Navy Cmdr. Richard Richards, the pilot,
were flying practice landings in a jet plane outfitted with shuttle
cockpit controls.
   Later, Shaw and Richard joined their crew mates for equipment
checks and briefings on launch preparations. The other crew members
are Navy Cmdr. David Leestma, Army Lt. Col. James Adamson and Air
Force Maj. Mark Brown.
   At launch pad 39B, workers Sunday loaded propellant into the
tanks of Columbia's power-producing fuel cells, checked engine fuel
lines, inspected thermal protection tiles and removed access
platforms.
   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, will be making its eighth flight,
but its first in 3{ years. Following the 1986 Challenger explosion,
NASA concentrated first on modifying sister ships Discovery and
Atlantis, and each has made two space trips since flights resumed
last September.
   Returning Columbia to flight status will give NASA three
orbiters to handle an increasing flight rate. Three more missions
are planned this year, with nine scheduled in 1990.
   Asked Saturday if he had confidence in riding in a shuttle that
had been grounded so long, commander Shaw replied: ``Absolutely,
you bet I do. I wouldn't fly it if I didn't. ... I flew Columbia a
long time ago. It's a great machine and it will be great again.''
   Shaw piloted Columbia on a November 1983 trip.

<HEAD>Syrian Rocket Fire Capsizes Boat Off Jounieh</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Syrian rocket fire on Sunday hit and
capsized a boat carrying passengers fleeing Lebanon's beleaguered
Christian enclave, and a 15-month-old Lebanese girl and her
2-year-old sister drowned.
   Three other people were killed and 18 wounded in overnight
shelling duels and clashes across Beirut's dividing Green Line, a
police spokesman said. By police count, 542 people have been killed
and 2,284 wounded since the latest round of fighting erupted March
8.
   The boat, ferrying passengers from the port of Jounieh to a
Cyprus-bound Hovercraft, capsized when a Syrian battery fired 40
rockets into the sea. Crew members from the Hovercraft lowered life
rafts and picked up six passengers, and another eight were rescued
by a fishing boat.
   ``We'd come under heavy fire ... I believe we were their
target,'' navigation officer Cesar Abi Aql said in Larnaca, Cyprus.
``We dropped the rafts and four of us went to the rescue. I saw the
baby girls but I had another passenger clinging to me ... When I
went back, they'd disappeared.''
   The sisters were identified as Maya Nabil Azar and her
2-year-old sister, Roba.
   The Hovercraft, the Norwegian-registered Santa Maria, makes a
daily run to Jounieh to pick up passengers from the Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   It usually anchors 300 yards offshore to avoid Syrian shellfire,
and passengers come aboard from smaller craft.
   The Santa Maria arrived in Larnaca with 320 passengers, shipping
agent Tony Mansour said.
   Syrian gunners bombard the enclave's coastline daily to prevent
supplies of weapons and fuel from reaching the Christians.
   The latest round in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war broke out
when Lebanese Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun blockaded illegal
ports operated by Syrian-backed Moslem militias that deny the state
treasury $100 million a year.
   Syrian troops joined their militia allies in fighting Aoun's
mainly Christian troops and besieging the Christian enclave.
   A Beirut police spokesman said the Syrians started shelling
Saturday night as a ship with food neared the Christian port of
Byblos and a tanker approached nearby Amsheet.
   Aoun's gunners struck back at Syrian batteries. The duels later
dwindled into random bombardment, said the spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing rules.
   He said Syrian and Christian troops also staged hit-and-run
grenade attacks along the three-mile line dividing the capital as
their tanks blasted each others' positions.
   Sniper bullets whizzed through residential areas and the two
sides battled near the city port in downtown Beirut's destroyed
commercial district.
   Shells and rockets rained on Moslem and Christian sectors all
night, forcing remaining residents to huddle in basements,
corridors and on stairways.
   More than 1.3 million of the city's 1.5-million people have fled
to safer areas of Lebanon. Men return in the mornings to go to work
but drive back to join their families early in the afternoon.
   Police said the Syrian army on Saturday brought dozens of T-62
tanks and BM-21 multirocket launchers into west Beirut and hills
overlooking the capital.
   The reinforcements arrived amid rumors that Aoun's 20,000 troops
might storm west Beirut to seize Lebanon's central bank, where most
of the nation's hard currency and gold reserves are stored.
   Around 40,000 Syrian troops have been stationed in Lebanon since
1976 under a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League. Aoun
charges the Syrians betrayed their mandate by siding with the
Moslems in their fight to share power with the traditionally
dominant Christians who are a minority in the country.

   Under such titles as ``Blood Was Shed Here'' and
``Young Woman, I Grieve For You,'' Beijing residents have been
submitting pro-government accounts of the city's recent turmoil to
an essay contest.
   In ``Blood Was Shed Here,'' Xu Dingjiang wrote that he watched
soldiers ``with tears in their hearts and guns in their hands''
restrain themselves from firing on a crowd that torched their
vehicles.
   Niu Hui wrote about a neighbor who reported that soldiers turned
Tiananmen Square, the center of seven weeks of pro-democracy
protests, into a crematorium for protesters they killed.
   ``I think after she saw the television video and understood the
true situation, she was very embarrassed,'' Niu wrote.
   Niu, Xu and the other entrants, whose works began appearing in
the tabloid Beijing Evening News last week, are competing for
undisclosed prizes to be given in November.
   Eight other papers or television stations are helping sponsor
the contest.
   The only requirements are that the stories ``touch the soul''
and be true.
   What is true about the tumultuous events that led to the June
3-4 military crackdown remains a matter of controversy.
   All entries published so far stick closely to the official
version, which says soldiers acted with restraint and that only
about 300 people died, including dozens of soldiers.
   Western observers, including hundreds of journalists, said the
army fired wildly at crowds and buildings and that the death toll
may have been in the thousands.
   The contest reflects the voracious appetite of the official
media for commentaries, letters and essays on what it calls the
``quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The media, apparently convinced that previous crackdowns on
dissent and liberal thought ended too quickly, are hanging on this
time despite a notable slackening of public interest.
   Many Beijing residents said they watched the first television
documentary on the protests several weeks ago, a four-part series.
But three more documentaries have been aired since, the latest
Sunday night, and many people chose not to watch them.
   ``I have better things to do,'' said one local shopkeeper.
   ``It's too exhausting, all this politics, the same thing all the
time,'' said a Chinese reporter.
   Some readers also are wondering about the real effects of
publishing so many reminiscences. Many columns criticizing ousted
party chief Zhao Ziyang, for example, have accused him of such
liberalism that he is becoming more popular to ordinary Chinese
than he ever was in office.
   ``It turns out Zhao was pretty good,'' one worker said after
attending a political study class at which Zhao was criticized.
   On Saturday, after Chinese authorities jammed incoming Voice of
America radio signals for weeks, the official Beijing Daily
splashed its reports all over its front page. The paper called it
an exhibit of the U.S. government-run station's ``false news
reports,'' but it did not censor out phrases such as ``the Chinese
People's Liberation Army's bloody massacre of protesters demanding
democracy.''
   ``It appears they are being criticized, but really their message
is getting across,'' said the Chinese reporter.

   Here is the text of a statement issued
Sunday by the Revolutionary Justice Organization as translated from
Arabic by The Associated Press:
   In the name of God, the Almighty,
   After the positive responses and the flexible stances announced
by the parties concerned, and the encouraging regional developments
that herald happy endings for the hostages, the Revolutionary
Justice Organization declares the practical stages of the
initiative for releasing (American hostage Joseph) Cicippio
immediately:
   1. In accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council
and humanitarian organizations calling for a halt to deporting
Palestinians and allowing the deportees during the intefadeh
(uprising) to return, the Revolutionary Justice Organization
demands that they be returned to their land via south Lebanon.
   2. The release of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid along with 150
detainees from the Lebanese resistance in all its nationalist and
Islamic factions, and 300 of the prisoners of the intefadeh
distributed equally between Hamas, Al-Jihad movement and the
unified command of the intefadeh (names will be discussed upon the
acceptance of the other side).
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization extends gratitude to all
parties who contributed to the success of diplomacy, especially
Syria which showed its eagerness to reach this stage, and appeals
to the Syrian leadership to agree to negotiate through
international organizations to ensure success to the initiative.
   Lastly, the organization notes that the success of this
initiative could be an adequate introduction to curb the dramatic
developments of the hostages issue.
   Victory to the downtrodden in the march toward justice,
   Glory and immortality for our martyrs,
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization.

<HEAD>Collection of Mementos Left At Vietnam Memorial Continues to Grow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As workers prepared to pour the foundation
for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982, someone asked if he
could leave a serviceman's Purple Heart in the concrete.
   That simple gesture was the start of what is now an enormous
collection of keepsakes left to the memory of the more than 58,000
servicemen and women named on the stark black monument that has
become known as ``the wall.''
   Military items, pictures, trinkets, flags, hundreds of teddy
bears, walking canes and beer cans and a pair of black lace panties
are among the things that appear daily along the base of the
memorial in Washington.
   They are carefully collected and catalogued by National Park
Service rangers and end up in a government repository in suburban
Lanham.
   The meaning behind the military insignia is obvious; the
relevance of other objects less so. Among the items left were
candle shaped like a corn cob, a cross with a barbed-wire ring, and
countless earrings, necklaces and other jewelry. There are record
albums by Dionne Warwick and Wes Montgomery, and a tape of songs by
the Carpenters.
   And flags, hundreds of flags, in all sizes.
   ``This is strictly a collection that the public has initiated,''
said Steve M. Bavisotto, who until recently was in charge of
cataloging each of the mementos and ensuring their preservation.
   Bavisotto left the park service in July for a job at the Army's
Center for Military History, but he still volunteers time to the
collection.
   ``It's a very good representation of our culture,'' he said.
``It's things that are important to Americans.''
   People who leave keepsakes at the wall don't know they'll be
part of a historical collection.
   Bavisotto believes some items were left by people who felt they
wanted to make a gesture but had nothing to share except what they
had with them.
   ``It's spontaneous,'' Bavisotto said. ``It's a spontaneous
reaction to being there.''
   ``There's no rhyme or reason to the panties. We can only
speculate,'' says Deury Felton, a museum technician and a Vietnam
veteran.
   Each item is preserved in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial
collection, which is kept by the park service.
   It was two years before anyone thought about making a permanent
collection of the keepsakes. From 1982, when the memorial was
dedicated, until 1984, they were stored in cardboard boxes in a
government garage.
   Park service rangers now pick up items from the wall twice a
day, tagging each and writing a brief description, before placing
them temporarily in vaults at the nearby Lincoln Memorial. As the
vaults are filled, boxes full of objects are taken to the Museum
and Archeological Research Storage repository in Lanham, a
climate-controlled building that houses artifacts from several
historical collections in the Washington area.
   The collection from the wall has grown to at least 15,000 items,
Bavisotto said.
   For each item, however insignificant it may seem, an entry is
prepared for a computerized catalogue. The only items not saved are
live flowers and other such items.
   For Felton, working with the collection every day evokes
unpleasant memories of his time in Vietnam in the late 1960s. But
he says he wouldn't trade his job.
   ``It's an honor,'' he says. ``It's something that should be done
to understand the sacrifices.''

<HEAD>Hundreds of East Germans Seek Asylum Via West German Embassies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 East Germans have sought
refuge in this country's East bloc embassies in an effort to flee
to the West, news reports said Sunday.
   The West German news reports emerged at a time when Hungarian
authorities say they may take the once unthinkable step of granting
political asylum to some East Germans.
   Hungary and East Germany are communist allies. However,
reform-minded Hungarian leaders are preparing for nationwide
multiparty elections while East German officials have stuck to
hard-line policies.
   A flood of East Germans attempting to leave their homeland
through Hungary has aggravated tension between the countries. It
has also prompted a flurry of diplomatic exchanges between Bonn and
Budapest in an effort to resolve the problem.
   The West German Welt am Sonntag newspaper said more than 200
East Germans are living in the West German Embassy in Budapest. It
said Bonn had rented an additional building to house the refugees.
   Hungary is a popular vacation spot for East Germans.
   Other East Germans have sought refuge in Bonn's missions in East
Berlin and Prague, Czechoslovakia, according to the news reports.
They said about 80 East Germans were at the mission in East Berlin
and about 20 in Prague.
   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN told citizens Sunday
not to seek refuge in West German missions in an attempt to force
authorities to grant them exit visas. It did not say anything about
punishment for those who ignored the warning.
   During democratic reform, Hungary has dismantled nearly half of
a 160-mile barbed-wire barrier along its frontier with Austria.
   The move has given new hope to many East Germans who want to
emigrate to the West. The border between East Germany and West
Germany is heavily fortified and guarded by troops, attack dogs and
sophisticated electronic alarm systems.
   One Hungarian Interior Ministry official, Judith Toth, said last
week that Budapest was considering whether East Germans can be
granted political asylum in Hungary, thus allowing them to travel
legally to West Germany.
   However, Karoly Nagy, the head of the Interior Ministry's
refugee office, said Friday that East Germans would have to clearly
show they are victims of political persecution.
   He said most East Germans caught trying to cross the border into
Austria were not fleeing political persecution but simply seeking a
better life.
   Nagy said the problem should be worked out between East and West
Germany.
   He confirmed that the passports of East Germans stopped while
trying to make an illegal crossing into Austria are stamped by
Hungarian officials.
   Critics of the practice say it exposes East Germans to possible
prosecution when they return home.
   However, Nagy said the stamp does not indicate that the bearer
attempted to flee to the West but simply states he was ordered to
leave Hungary.
   The Bild am Sonntag newspaper quoted the country's Foreign
Ministry officials as saying they are trying to get the Hungarians
to drop the practice.
   ``With the mark of Cain in their passports, many East Germans
face severe reprisals,'' the newspaper quoted a Foreign Ministry
official as saying.

<HEAD>Chief Proposes Child Care At Firehouses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Round-the-clock child care at city fire stations
would help lure single parents to the department and make it easier
for firefighters to care for their children during 24-hour work
shifts, the fire chief says.
   ``It's a unique problem for firefighters,'' Fire Chief Rich
Gonzales said Friday. ``For them to have to rely all the time on
neighbors and grandmothers, it becomes a burden.
   ``It's difficult to recruit women if they're single parents. ...
They want to be firefighters but ask who's going to take care of
the kids when they're at the firehouse,'' he said.
   Gonzales said he knew of no other department in the country with
such a program. A task force of Denver firefighters and day-care
workers probably will be set up to decide the best way to run and
pay for the program.
   Neighborhood fire stations would be natural locations for
24-hour child care, officials said, because they have kitchens,
bedrooms and bathrooms.
   The problem would address one of the problems Denver has had in
recruiting women to the department. Only nine female firefighters
are on the staff, but the latest round of recruiting brought in
applications from 274 women.
   ``This probably will attract more women,'' said first-year
firefighter Michelle Collins. With firefighters on duty for 24
hours at a time, child care is a big problem, she said.
   Firefighters routinely ask to be transferred to eight-hour-a-day
desk jobs to accommodate growing families. But Capt. Charles
McMillan of the recruitment unit said such positions aren't always
available.
   ``The department has been sensitive enough to realize people
have these needs,'' he said. ``If I were in that 24-hour period, I
would have to put my daughter in somebody else's care, and being a
parent you always think you give the best care.''
   Gonzales said he would meet this week with his top officers to
discuss the plan.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Kill 70 in Sri Lanka, 29 Dead in Other Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sri Lankan military officials said
Sunday that Indian peacekeeping troops killed 70 people in weekend
offensives on ethnic Tamil rebels in northern areas.
   The officials said 29 other people, including a Buddhist monk,
died Friday and Saturday in Sinhalese radical violence elsewhere.
   An Indian Embassy official confirmed the military offensive but
said only three Tamil rebels were killed in two days.
   The Sri Lankan officials, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, gave few details about either the fighting in
northern towns and jungles or the other deaths.
   However, residents in the northern town of Vavuniya said by
telephone that about 70 Tamils were killed in gunfire and shelling
from Indian forces.
   The residents, quoting travelers who arrived in their city, said
23 victims had been identified as civilians. The residents spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Indian official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said he had no reports of any civilian casualties.
   Residents in Jaffna, about 190 miles north of Colombo, said 40
homes and 23 shops were destroyed in the shelling. Other damage was
in Velvettiturai, 20 miles north of Jaffna, they said.
   The claims could not be independently confirmed. Movement in the
area is restricted by the Indian troops, who were sent to the
northeast two years ago to disarm Tamil rebels.
   The Indian troops were deployed under terms of an India-Sri
Lanka accord in July 29, 1987. The agreement was aimed at ending a
Tamil insurrection for an independent homeland.
   Sinhalese radicals bitterly oppose the Indian presence, which
rose to about 45,000 troops. In 1987, they launched a violent
anti-government campaign, killing at least 4,000 people.
   The Sinhalese extremists also say the government gave too many
concessions to the Tamils in the 1987 accord, which provided
limited autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender by Tamil
militias.
   The government has also been negotiating with India on a
withdrawal of Indian troops. Sri Lankan officials say they should
be pulled out quickly, but India says a rapid withdrawal could lead
to more violence.
   At least 11,000 people have been killed in the 6-year-old Tamil
separatist war.
   In the latest violence by the Sinhalese militants, the radicals
of the left-wing People's Liberation Front shot and killed the
chief priest of a Buddhist temple in Puttalam, 75 miles north of
Colombo, a government statement said. It did not say on which day
he was killed.
   The slaying of Pokunu Bandana Hemaloka followed Thursday's fatal
shooting of the chief priest of a Colombo temple.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. Many
Tamils say they suffer discrimination at the hands of the
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population and control
the government.

   A man drowned and a second was missing
and presumed dead after their raft went over a dam on a stretch of
the Milwaukee River that had been marked as dangerous, police said
Sunday.
   The two went over the dam Saturday evening and got in trouble in
the rapids below it, said acting Police Chief Dick Preston.
   Rescue crews searched unsuccessfully for the bodies about four
hours until the search was called off because of darkness. Sunday
morning, searchers found the body of Timothy Thompson, 27, of
Milwaukee about a half-mile downstream from the dam, authorities
said.
   Crews continued Sunday afternoon to search for the body of the
second victim, identified as a 31-year-old Mequon man. His name was
not immediately released.
   The stretch of the river where the accident occurred, just north
of Milwaukee, was marked as dangerous and the two men apparently
ignored the warning, Preston said.

<TEXT>
   The official Libyan news agency criticized the
British media Sunday for ridiculing Col. Moammar Gadhafi's
contention that William Shakespeare was of Arab origin.
   JANA, monitored in Rome, also said that any Arab ties to
Shakespeare would not increase Arab prestige but would be instead
``an honor to the British and Shakespeare himself and his family.''
   ``The smell of chauvinism seems to have overwhelmed the
atmosphere of the talk broadcast by the British radio on the
historical view regarding the attribution of the name of
Shakespeare to Arab origins, as put forward by brother Moammar
Gadhafi,'' JANA said in a dispatch titled ``Shakespeare: Is He
Arab?''
   The agency said the British media should have used ``scientific
analysis'' in discussing Shakespeare's origins, rather than
``throwing insults and defamation and using description against
others no civilized mind would accept.''
   The dispatch attributed the reports in the British media to ``a
very strong pressure of Zionist egoism which does not recognize the
right of others to freedom of expression.''
   Three British newspapers ridiculed Gadhafi for the assertion. A
fourth, The Daily Telegraph, described it as a joke that Gadhafi
had originally told the deputies of the Tunisian Parliament in
December.

   Presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya are set to meet Monday for talks aimed at
ending the 12-year-old civil war in Mozambique.
   About 100,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the
war, which has made refugees of another 1.6 million people and
ruined the economy of the southern African nation.
   Mugabe and Moi are expected to confer with Afonso Dhlakama,
leader of the rebel Mozambique National Resistance, and Mozambican
church leaders representing the government.
   The rebel and government delegations are not expected to meet,
but to exchange proposals through the mediating presidents.
   Mugabe on Saturday announced the visit to ``compare notes'' with
Moi after he met in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare with President
Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique. Details of their discussions were
not released.
   Last month, Mugabe said Chissano asked him to join Moi in trying
to negotiate an end to the war.
   The Mozambique government representatives _ Roman Catholic and
Protestant members of the Mozambique Christian Council _ reportedly
are carrying a 12-point peace plan from Chissano, but details have
not been made public.
   Dhlakama and the church delegation arrived in Nairobi late last
week. They originally were to meet in Kenya's capital last month,
but Dhlakama failed to arrive.
   The rebels initially rejected the mediation of Zimbabwe, which
has about 12,000 soldiers fighting alongside Mozambican government
forces to protect rail links and an oil pipeline from the Indian
Ocean.
   The rebels formerly were backed by the white-ruled government
South Africa in their fight to oust the Marxist Maputo government.
But they no longer have open support from any government and are
widely accused of atrocities against civilians.

   The close of the Supreme Soviet's first session
ended a dramatic five months in which workers and upstart
politicians aided by Mikhail S. Gorbachev shook a well-oiled
machine's stranglehold on political power.
   Officials who dominated Soviet life for more than a half-century
took an unprecedented bashing, beginning with March elections,
through July coal miners' strikes and the final days of the
legislative session that ended Friday.
   The party undoubtedly still is the strongest force in society
and Gorbachev's authority is not questioned. But those who
traditionally have wielded power were left dazed and unsure.
   Dozens were humiliated in their first competitive elections.
Some were exposed to the fury of miners who cannot buy enough soap.
A half-dozen others were rejected by the Supreme Soviet for Cabinet
jobs.
   New deputies criticized Gorbachev, rewrote tax and labor laws,
and even suggested Vladimir I. Lenin be removed from his mausoleum
on Red Square.
   Deputies ``literally burst onto the podium with their platforms,
program, proposals, accusations,'' Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told
a recent party meeting. ``But the Politburo ended up over on the
side, in some kind of isolated state, as if some paralysis syndrome
were at work.''
   ``A real and mighty power has appeared _ the Congress of
People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet _ and we cannot refuse to
come to grips with it,'' he said. ``If the party does not find a
way out of this situation, it may lose its influence in running the
government.''
   It was small consolation that 85 percent of deputies are party
members. Like never before, they are unconstrained by a strict
party line.
   Former candidate Politburo member Boris N. Yeltsin turned his
rocky relationship with the party into a populist campaign against
incompetence and special privilege. A week ago, several hundred
deputies helped him form the first organized parliamentary
opposition in 70 years.
   Regional officials plead for direction from Gorbachev.
   ``It's time to clearly determine where is the limit of party and
government discipline, and where is pluralism of opinion,'' said
Absamat Masaliev, party chief in the Central Asian republic of
Kirghizia.
   Moscow party leader Lev N. Zaikov said lack of direction has
upset many local party organizations that have reacted by doing
nothing.
   Since the time of Lenin, a clear purpose and strong organization
have meant power for the Communist Party.
   Today many officials are confused and hesitant.
   ``How has this come about?'' Gorbachev mused. ``A party
organization consisting of thousands, with its own newspapers, its
own professional staff, with everything at its disposal, finds the
initiative slipping out of its grasp?''
   Instead of providing a detailed party line, he has proved
willing even to side with critics.
   It was Gorbachev who masterminded the electoral system that
embarrassed dozens of key party officials.
   The strike by hundreds of thousands of miners reiterated that
common people are taking to heart Gorbachev's call to action. This
spasm of unrest for the first time was based on something all
Soviets have in common _ the poor state of the economy.
   Gorbachev sympathized with the strikers and promised changes.
   Their activity gave Gorbachev a large but intangible victory in
his drive to turn more power back to the people, leading to the
question at the heart of his reforms: what will the people do with
power if and when they get it?
   At least one political scientist, Andronik Migranyan, wonders
how long people will allow Gorbachev to lead them against the party
apparatus he heads.
   Gorbachev ``practically found himself two roles: both Luther and
the Pope,'' Migranyan wrote recently. ``He wants to destroy the
existing structures, and at the same time personifies those
structures for the public. And certainly, lack of successes which
are due to the clumsy function of the party and state structure
weaken his role as leader.''
   Even Politburo members warn that if the party does not improve
its standing, the Soviet Union may spin out of control.
   An end to the Communists' hold on absolute power would be
``simply deadly,'' said Yegor K. Ligachev. ``A multiparty system
would mean the breakup of the Soviet federation ... because the
Communist Party is the only real political force that binds and
unites all people of the country into a single union of republics.''

   When the plane carrying presidential aide
Steve Studdert tried to land on Africa's Serengeti plains, it first
had to buzz the landing area to ``chase off a couple hundred
wildebeests.''
   That accomplished, he recalled, none of the passengers dared
deplane until some feasting lions polished off the dinner they had
felled nearby.
   The episode en route to an energy meeting in Kenya was just one
of many on Studdert's 5 million-mile odyssey searching out the
perfect image for three presidents.
   He went by air, in everything from F-16 fighters to blimps; he
went by sea, in everything from submarines to tugboats; and he went
by land, in everything from fire trucks to ambulances.
   But after surveying the sights from the shipyards of Poland to
the wild creatures of the Serengeti, the White House advance guru
is hanging it up at the White House to point his trusty jeep
homeward to the sleepy town of Highland, Utah.
   Studdert _ formally the assistant to President Bush for special
activities and initiatives _ said he wants to leave government for
a more quiet life, and denies reports he is planning to run for
governor of Utah.
   It's just time, he said, to spend his time on things other than
boating down the Mississippi to plan a presidential tour of flood
devastation or riding the rails across Ohio on a campaign whistle
stop.
   But he is not shy about recalling his behind-the-scenes role in
shaping years of presidential level memories.
   ``What was wonderful for me, as I look at the most recent Europe
trip, I realize that 45 days before the president went there, I was
there,'' Studdert said in an interview. ``I stood in an empty
church in Leiden. I stood in an empty square in Gdansk. In my
mind's eye I saw what I hoped could be. What a wonderful feeling it
was to go with the president and see it happen.''
   What happened was 25,000 Poles packed into the square in Gdansk,
cheering an American president. What happened was several hundred
Dutch sitting quietly in a church to hear an American president
speak movingly on democratic ideals that had taken root in the
Netherlands before there was a United States of America.
   To make those and hundreds of other events ``happen'' involved a
morass of logistical details including dealing with foreign
governments and southern country sheriffs on motorcades, security,
crowd control, press arrangements and other aspects.
   White House Chief of Protocol Joseph Reed marvelled at how
Studdert and his team coordinate the trips that in effect entail
moving the entire White House.
   Reed called him ``Cecil B. de Studdert.''
   A former advance man for Presidents Ford and Reagan, Studdert
was tapped by presidential candidate Bush last year to work on
flag-waving imagery that would portray Bush as the candidate of
patriotism.
   After the election, he accompanied Bush to the White House to
come up with event scenarios, speech settings, props and travel
plans that showcase the president's policy goals. He has headed up
the logistics plans that have taken Bush to 12 countries and 24
states in his first six months in office.
   Given his estimate that he's traveled nearly 5 million miles
doing White House and campaign advance work, some things were bound
to go wrong.
   Once he paid some teen-agers $20 to use their pickup truck for a
parade for presidential candidate Gerald Ford. He didn't find out
until the parade was moving around a race track that the truck
belonged not to the youths, but to a man in the stands, who was
shocked to see his vehicle roll by filled with press photographers.
   ``We never saw the kids again,'' Studdert said.
   Another motorcade problem came on election night in 1980, when
Ronald Reagan wanted to go to his victory celebration early because
President Carter conceded early. There were no motorcade vehicles
to be seen outside Reagan's house.
   ``We stopped the first six cars coming along. One of the cars
was driven by one of the Gabor sisters. We just loaded up the press
corps and said let's go.''
   One of Studdert's most harrowing days also provided his most
poignant memory, one of those small things one never forgets.
   It was his first assignment during the Reagan presidency _
coordinating the return of the 52 American hostages from Iran whose
return on Inauguration Day 1981 was negotiated under President
Carter.
   At the last minute he was told to find a band for the hostages'
arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. He scouted
around and found a Navy band. The only requirement, he told the
leader, was that his musicians be able to play ``Tie a Yellow
Ribbon.''
   They learned it on the bus driving to the base.
   Studdert wanted a marching band, but this one was a concert band.
   ``Today, you're a marching band,'' he told them.
   ``I will never forget the trombone player marching along playing
`Tie a Yellow Ribbon' with tears running down his cheeks,'' he said.

   Sen. Bob Dole shrugged off Sunday a rebuke
from fellow Republican Jack Kemp for the Senate minority leader's
pointed criticism of the Israeli abduction of a Moslem cleric.
   Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development and a former
congressman, reportedly complained at a private gathering of GOP
lawmakers last Wednesday that Dole was making the Republican party
look anti-Israel.
   The Kansas senator, irate at the reported execution of Marine
Lt. Col. William Higgins, complained last week that Israel should
have exercised more responsibility before it abducted Sheik Abdul
Karim Obeid and should not have been ``free-lancing'' with U.S.
hostage lives at stake in Lebanon.
   Kemp voiced his criticism at a meeting of GOP lawmakers in the
office of the Republican minority leader of the House, Rep. Bob
Michel of Illinois, on Wednesday.
   Kemp said Dole's remarks shouldn't stand unchallenged because
they made the Republican party seem to be ``blaming Israel rather
than blaming terrorists.''
   Asked about the criticism Sunday on ABC's ``This Week with David
Brinkley,'' Dole said:
   ``I think Kemp ought to be worrying about HUD, if I were
secretary of HUD. He's got plenty of problems there.''
   HUD has been enveloped in an influence-peddling scandal from the
Reagan administration.

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over much of the nation Sunday as
temperatures in the 90s snapped records up to 54 years old in North
Carolina and New Jersey.
   Rain fell in central New England, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama,
Mississippi, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas and
Colorado.
   Near Hopkinsville, Ky., thunderstorm-generated small hail
damaged trees and power lines. Thunderstorm gusts also caused
damage in Dundee, N.Y.
   The mercury hit 92 degrees in Cape Hatteras, N.C., 1 defree
higher than the old record for the date set in 1935. It was 96 in
Newark, N.J., where the old record of 95 was set in 1955.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Houghton Lake, Mich., to 107 degrees at Needles, Calif.
   The low for the Lower 48 states Sunday morning was 38 degrees at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Monday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from New England, to eastern New York, New Jersey,
eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, eastern West Virginia,
Virginia and eastern North Carolina, from the Florida Panhandle to
Louisiana, central and northern Texas and the Texas Panhandle, and
over the Great Lakes, the upper and middle Mississippi Valley and
the northern half of the Great Plains.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 90s from North Carolina
to Florida, the southern Gulf Coast states, Louisiana and the
central Rockies; the upper 50s in upper Michigan; the 60s and 70s
from northern New England to the upper and central Appalachians,
the Ohio Valley, the rest of southern Texas, southern New Mexico,
the Rockies, Nevada, and much of the lower two thirds of the

<HEAD>15 Inmates on Hunger Strike in Critical Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities said 15 leftist political
prisoners are in critical condition Sunday after 39 days on a
hunger strike, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
   It said the 15 inmates were sent to a hospital Sunday but were
returned to the infirmary of the high-security prison in western
Aydin province after they refused medical attention.
   Two hunger strikers already have died. Officials blamed
dehydration. Newspapers said the men were beaten to death.
   They are among 280 prisoners who started refusing food at
Eskisehir prison on June 28 to protest restrictions imposed after
prison authorities discovered several incomplete escape tunnels.
   Anatolia said hunger strikes have spread to other prisons and
nearly 1,800 inmates in six towns and cities were fasting Sunday in
solidarity with the Aydin inmates and to protest the two deaths.
   The Eskisehir prisoners were transfered Wednesday to Aydin, 300
miles west, so that workers could repair damage to the prison. That
is when two of the strikers died.
   Aydin prosecutor Nural Ucurum said a special ward for 40
prisoners was prepared at Aydin State Hospital, Anatolia reported.
   The leftist inmates are among thousands detained after a 1980
military takeover halted a wave of political terrorism that pitted
a dozen leftist groups against extreme rightists. About 5,000
people died in that violence.
   According to the independent Human Rights Association, 1,542
people detained on terrorism charges still are in prison awaiting
trial and 1,357 are serving sentences.

<HEAD>Chinese Student Leader Stands Up the Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese student leader Wu'er Kaixi spent part of
the weekend at the Kennedy family compound on Cape Cod, but didn't
make it to a scheduled breakfast meeting with Mayor Raymond Flynn
on Sunday.
   Wu'er, 21, played a key role in the student protests last spring
in Beijing and escaped China just prior to the June military
crackdown at Tiananmen Square. He reportedly may enroll at Harvard
University this fall.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., invited Wu'er and another
Chinese student to the family's Hyannis Port home for a clambake
and a little sailing Saturday with, among others, Rep. Joe Kennedy,
D-Mass., Rhode Island state Rep. Patrick Kennedy, Eunice Shriver
and Ethel Kennedy.
   ``They were down at the compound and we drove them back to
Boston,'' Kennedy spokesman Marc O'Connor said. He said the missed
visit with Flynn apparently resulted from a misunderstanding
between the mayor and the students' representatives.
   Flynn spokesman Michael Lynch said the mayor was not worried
about Wu'er's absence. ``It was simply a matter of miscommunication
or a conflict in scheduling,'' Lynch said.
   Calls to The China Project in Newton, an information
clearinghouse for Chinese students, went unanswered Sunday, but
O'Connor said he believed Wu'er was staying with students in the
area.

<HEAD>Former Airmen Say Dropping the Bomb Saved Lives</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hiroshima, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Two of the airmen who dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in
the world's first nuclear attack 44 years ago Sunday say they still
have no regrets about the mission, and they insist it sped up the
end of the war with Japan.
   Jacob Beser, 68, was aboard the bomber Enola Gay, which dropped
the bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1944, and Bock's Car, which bombed
Nagasaki three days later.
   ``A popular misconception is that we reacted like, `My God, what
did we do?''' said the retired engineer. ``Instead, just like every
other G.I. on a mission, it was, `My God, look at that ... go!'''
   About 140,000 people were killed in the Hiroshima attack and
70,000 died at Nagasaki. Japan surrendered unconditionally on Aug.
15, 1945, ending World War II without the costly invasion the
United States had feared it would have to mount.
   ``What we did was right, was necessary, saved lives _ and I hope
we never have to do it again,'' Beser said this weekend in Memphis.
``I have a lot of confidence in the future.''
   Retired Brig. Gen. Paul Tibbetts Jr., who flew the Enola Gay
over Hiroshima and into history, said that at the time he thought,
``if I am successful, I can bring this war to a quick end.''
   Tibbetts, 74, said he had no qualms about the mission, but has
occasionally been questioned by anti-nuclear groups or individuals.
   ``I don't have to justify it with anybody,'' he said recently
from his home in Columbus, Ohio.
   ``I did what I was supposed to do _ exactly what I was supposed
to do,'' Tibbetts said. ``I carried out a very successful bombing
mission. I didn't want to be a hero.''
   Then-Col. Tibbetts was one of America's most experienced bomber
pilots when he was given the top-secret Hiroshima mission.
   ``Being only 29 years old when I got the assignment ... there
wasn't anything that was going to stop me,'' he said.
   He and his crew of 14 took off in their B-29 Superfortress early
the morning of Aug. 6 from Tinian Island in the western Pacific,
1,750 miles from Hiroshima.
   The Enola Gay arrived at its destination at 8:15 a.m local time,
and dropped its deadly payload from 31,000 feet. It exploded in a
blinding flash.
   Then-Lt. Beser's job was to monitor Japan for possible
electronic interference that could cause the bombs to malfunction.
   ``I never saw the city of Hiroshima,'' he said. ``I just saw
this big, boiling mess, and fires breaking out on the periphery.''
   Beser, who visited Hiroshima in 1985, said he felt detached
during the bombing missions.
   ``If somebody had given me a rifle and said, `Go out and kill
those Japanese,' I'm not sure I could have done it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Widow of Man Who Shot Stockbrokers, Self Seeks Insurance Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of a man who killed a stockbroker,
wounded another and killed himself after losing a fortune in the
1987 stock market crash is battling his insurance companies in
court for $1.5 million in unpaid claims.
   Judith Kane, 49, claims she is entitled to collect $1 million
from Bankers Security Life Insurance and $500,000 from Prudential
Insurance Co. on life insurance policies taken out by her late
husband, Arthur Kane.
   But both insurers refuse to pay because Arthur Kane never told
them he was really Arthur Katz, a disbarred lawyer in the federal
witness protection program.
   Last week, a three-judge panel from the Atlanta-based 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals traveled to Miami to hear arguments in the
case, which the insurers appealed after losing a round in federal
court in Miami.
   ``Bankers Security thought they were insuring a mild-mannered,
longtime government employee,'' Alan Fine, a lawyer for Bankers
Security, said after the hearing. ``Instead they were insuring
someone very different.''
   Fine said the judges acknowledged the case is unique.
   ``There is no Florida law covering this kind of situation,'' he
said.
   But Mrs. Kane's lawyer, David Pollack, was upbeat about the
outcome of the appeal.
   ``We are confident she'll win again,'' Pollack said.
   A ruling was expected in six months, Fine said.
   The appeal is the latest round in the dispute that broke out
over Kane's life insurance policies shortly after his suicide.
   Kane, 53, reportedly lost $4 million in the Oct. 19, 1987,
crash. A week later, he walked into the Merrill Lynch office in
suburban Miami with a .357-caliber Magnum pistol and shot office
manager Jose Argilagos to death.
   He next turned the gun on his stockbroker, Lloyd Kolokoff, and
shot him in the back, paralyzing him for life. Kane then killed
himself.
   The two-year suicide exclusion clause in his insurance policies
had expired.
   The shootings put Kane in the national spotlight, and revealed
he really was Katz, a federal informant with suspected ties to
organized crime.
   Katz was a disbarred Kansas City, Mo., lawyer given a new
identity 11 years earlier after testifying for the government in
several cases.
   While Kane earned $29,676 working at the Social Security
Administration in Miami, he lived in a $430,000, six-bedroom home
in Miami's prosperous Kendall section.
   According to Bankers Security of Virginia and Prudential of New
Jersey, Kane negated his policies by not disclosing his real name.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with activists defying police restrictions;

<TEXT>
   Twenty-one anti-apartheid
activists openly defied their police restrictions Sunday by
appearing at a rally where speakers called for intensifying a
nationwide civil disobedience campaign.
   On Sunday, an estimated 2,000 people, led by Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, attended an evening service at the African Methodist
Episcopal church in the mixed-race township of Athlone outside Cape
Town.
   Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak urged the crowd to support a
recently launched mass defiance campaign that is the most ambitious
such effort by opposition groups in 30 years.
   The 21 activists, who publicly identified themselves and said
they would not abide by their police orders, have been restricted
since their release from detention earlier this year.
   The restrictions vary, but most activists are required to be at
home from dusk to dawn and are not allowed to attend meetings where
the government is criticized.
   No uniformed police were present.
   The government has released almost 1,000 detainees since they
went on a hunger strike in January. However, about half have been
placed under restriction orders, according to human rights groups.
   An estimated 30,000 people, almost all black, have been detained
without charge for varying lengths of time under the 3-year-old
state of emergency, although only a few dozen currently are held.
   The defiance campaign began Wednesday, when 270 blacks and
Indians sought and received treatment at whites-only hospitals. The
Mass Democratic Movement, a loosely organized anti-apartheid
coalition that arranged the protest, promised additional acts of
defiance.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok has said the campaign is ``a
time bomb that could explode at any moment.''
   Also Sunday, police said in a report on unrest over the past 24
hours that six black men were killed in separate incidents near the
southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg. Black factional fighting in
the region has claimed 2,000 lives since 1986.
   Four men died when blacks set fire to a house in the Mpumalanga
township outside Pietermaritzburg, and two black men were shot
fatally in separate attacks in nearby townships, the report said.
   A seventh black man was shot to death in Kwathema, east of
Johannesburg, police said.
   Main combatants in the Pietermaritzburg violence are the United
Democratic Front, a banned anti-apartheid coalition, and Inkatha, a
Zulu group headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Both groups oppose the apartheid policy of race discrimination,
but the United Democratic Front favors confrontational tactics such
as boycotts, sanctions, strikes and protests that Inkatha does not
endorse.

<TEXT>
   Two top-of-the-line Soviet fighters
accompanied by the world's largest aircraft made a historic stop at
Elmendorf Air Force Base on Sunday, en route to a ``sales mission''
in Canada.
   It was the first time that MiG-29 fighters and the Soviet An-225
transport had landed on the North American continent.
   ``These are showroom models,'' said Maj. Doug McCoy, an
Elmendorf spokesman who was referring to the pair of stripped-down
MiG-29s that had taxied to within 20 yards of journalists, Air
Force observers and about 250 spectators.
   ``These are factory aircraft. They haven't been delivered to the
Soviet Air Force. Civilian test pilots are flying the MiGs.''
   The Soviets were en route to the Abbotsford International Air
Show in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   There, the fighters and the giant transport will be displayed
and demonstrated as part of the Soviet military's latest and
greatest.
   After a four-hour refueling stop in Alaska they were to be
escorted to the Canadian border by U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagles. They
were to be met by Canadian Forces CF-18s Hornet jet fighters.
   ``This is the first time since 1945 that Soviet fighter aircraft
have flown through Alaska airspace,'' said Lt. Gen. Thomas
McInerney, commander of the Alaskan Air Command. ``It hasn't been
since Lend-Lease when some 8,000 planes left U.S. factories being
flown directly to the Soviet Eastern Front that we've marked such
an occurrence.
   ``Today we are hosting the Soviet military aircraft en route to
a much friendlier event.''
   Capt. Richard Armstrong, one of the F-15 Eagle fighter pilots
who escorted the MiGs through U.S. airspace, said it was thrilling
to be the first American pilot to get so close to the Soviet
frontline fighter.
   ``I'd like to say it was another day at the office, but I'd be
ying,'' Armstrong said. ``It's a pretty airplane. I felt a little
like you do when you have guests in your house. You want to make
them feel comfortable, but you give them some help.''
   The Soviets took time to participate in a news conference Sunday
primarily to express thanks for the welcome they had been shown.
   They were hosted for lunch at the Elmendorf Officers' Club and
invited to shop at the Base Exchange.
   ``We were met by excellent aircraft and excellent pilots,'' said
Anotoly Kvochur, a Mikoyan Test Bureau pilot who does the
demonstration flights of the MiG-29s at air shows. ``I hope our
relations will be just as they are and will improve.''
   Kvochur was forced to eject from a MiG-29 two months ago at the
Paris Air Show when the aircraft sucked a bird into a jet intake
during a low-altitude pass.
   The green, gray and black MiG-29s are twin-engine fighters
comparable in size to the Navy's F-A-18 Hornet.
   The transport has six turbofan engines and plays a major role in
the Soviet space program, in which it shuttles the Buran space
shuttle orbiter and sections of rocket launch vehicles.
   It was unknown to the West until a prototype was unveiled last
year. Fewer than 10 are likely to be manufactured, Air Force
officials said.

<HEAD>Arab Teenager Wounded in Clash, Palestinian Dies of Wounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed
Sunday in a clash with troops, and hospital officials said another
Arab died of wounds sustained in a previous confrontation.
   The army confirmed hospital reports that Fayiz Aish el-Nadr was
killed in the Gaza Strip in a clash with troops and said it was
investigating the circumstances of his death.
   Arab hospital officials said another Palestinian youth, Mones
Abdel Jawad Mohammed Faris, 16, died Sunday of wounds he sustained
in a clash Wednesday in the Gaza town of Khan Yunis. Officials said
Faris had been shot in the neck and the head.
   The deaths raised to 529 the Palestinian death toll in the
19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Thirty-eight Israelis
have also died.
   Also Sunday, an Israeli soldier was wounded in a firebomb attack
on an army patrol in the open-air market in Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city, the army said.
   Troops launched a search for the attackers and clamped a curfew
on the market and on a nearby neighborhood, the army said. The
curfew forced about 40,000 residents to stay indoors, Arab
reporters said.
   The radio and Arab reporters in Nablus said the army patrol
responded to the attack with gunfire, and the military later put up
roadblocks throughout the city.
   The attack followed a night march by about 60 uniformed and
masked supporters of PLO chief Yasser Arafat. They raised an
outlawed Palestinian flag and called through loudspeakers for PLO
factions to unite under Arafat's Fatah wing, Arab journalists said.
   In another development, a police spokesman in Jerusalem called
the arson attack on a Jewish-owned house in the Old City's Moslem
quarter Saturday night a nationalist assault.
   Spokesman Avi Zelba said the house was heavily damaged when the
assailants broke in, poured flammable material and lit it. No
injuries were reported.
   Several hundred Jews, including religious seminary students,
live in the Moslem quarter, which is home to 23,000 Arabs. Four
Jewish families moved into the Moslem quarter last month, and
Israeli media said the arson attack seemed a warning to them.
   Also Sunday, Army radio and the Hadashot daily quoted Mahmoud
Ali Shaaban, 22, of the Gaza Strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, as
confessing to the stabbing murder of two inmates at the southern
desert Ketziot prison camp for Palestinians on Saturday.
   Hadashot quoted Shaaban as saying he killed one detainee in a
personal dispute and the second because he suspected the victim of
collaborating with Israel.
   At least 89 Palestinians have been slain by their brethren as
suspected collaborators.

   The trial of 54 Moslem fundamentalists,
including a blind preacher twice acquitted of charges linked to the
assassination of former President Anwar Sadat, opened Sunday amid
tight security.
   The 54 were arrested following an anti-government demonstration
allegedly led by the preacher, Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, on April 7
in southern Fayoum.
   He and 48 others are charged with illegal possession of weapons,
attempting to kill a police officer, and assault on individuals and
public property.
   The crimes are punishable by death.
   Three others were charged in connection with the bombing of a
theater in Fayoum, and two were charged with distributing leaflets
demanding Abdel-Rahman's release.
   Police rounded up 1,500 fundamentalists in a nationwide
crackdown following the Fayoum protest.
   ``The government has made up these charges because we exposed
its evil and corruption,'' Abdel-Rahman said Sunday of his new
charges. ``We must have patience and not budge even if we are
jailed.''
   The defendents chanted ``there is no God but Allah'' as they
were taken to the court grounds in prison vans. Rows of security
police lined the huge courtroom, a transformed trade-fair hall.
   Presiding Judge Kadry Samak adjourned the trial until Thursday
and ordered Abdel-Rahman, who reportedly is in poor health, be
taken to the prison hospital. It was not known how long the trial
would last.
   The defendents, mostly young men dressed in white robes, said
they had been on hunger strike since Wednesday to protest prison
conditions and demand the release of Abdel-Rahman.
   Defendents interrupted the five-hour session three times to
alert the judges that one of them had fainted.
   Abdel-Rahman was tried and acquitted in connection with Sadat's
Oct. 6, 1981 assassination by Moslem extremists. He was also
aquitted in a trial of 300 fundamentalists involved in a subsequent
coup attempt in the southern city of Assiut.
   The government had charged that Abdel-Rahman instigated the
president's murder by telling his followers Sadat had abandoned
Islam.
   Abdel-Rahman, a former theology professor, is one of Egypt's
best known dissidents. He leads the Moslem fundamentalist Jihad
group, which Egyptian courts blamed for Sadat's assassination.
   The group advocates the immediate implementation of Islamic law.

   The pro-Iranian captors of American
hostage Joseph Cicippio said Sunday they would free him immediately
if Israel releases an abducted Shiite Moslem cleric and 150
Lebanese and 300 Palestinian prisoners.
   The group, Revolutionary Justice Organization, also demanded
that Israel allow all 55 Palestinians deported during the uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied territories to return home.
   Also Sunday, a leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah said an
Israeli soldier it holds could be killed unless Israel frees the
cleric. The Hezbollah leader, Hussein Mousawi, also admitted for
the first time that the party wields influence over the kidnappers
of foreign hostages.
   Israeli officials refused comment on both the Revolutionary
Justice and Mousawi statements. Earlier, they said the cleric,
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, would only be freed if two Israeli
soldiers and an air force navigator held in south Lebanon were
freed.
   In Washington, Bill Harlow, a White House spokesman, said, ``We
wouldn't comment on it in any way. ... We try not to react to each
individual rumor or report. It's a very fluid situation and that
doesn't do any good.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Mexico City for a
conference of U.S. and Mexican Cabinet members, was asked about the
demands for Cicipio's release and he said ``our well-established
policy is not to negotiate with terrorists.
   ``If the United States were to get into that game, we'd simply
see a lot more Americans taken hostage around the world.''
   He reaffirmed the U.S. policy of neither concurring in nor
objecting to the Israeli position of offering to negotiate with
hostage-takers for the release of captives in Lebanon.
   The proposal by the Revolutionary Justice Organization made no
mention of freedom for any of the other 15 foreigners held in
Lebanon.
   It was contained in a handwritten statement, written in Arabic
and delivered to the independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar. An
instant photograph of American hostage Edward Tracy, whom the group
also holds, was sent along with it.
   It was the first time Revolutionary Justice has said it would
free Cicippio, 58, a hostage since Sept. 12, 1986.
   The statement cited ``the flexible stances declared by the
parties concerned and the encouraging regional developments that
herald happy endings to the hostage problem'' for making the
exchange offer.
   The group threatened last week to kill Cicippio if Israel did
not free Obeid, who is affiliated with Hezbollah and was abducted
by Israeli commandos July 28. Israel accused Obeid of instigating
attacks on the Jewish state.
   Less than an hour before the deadline set for Cicippio's death,
Revolutionary Justice said it was ``freezing'' the execution order
and substituting it with an ``initiative'' calling for Obeid's
release and freedom for Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held by
Israel.
   Sunday's statement said the new demands represented the
``practical stages of the initiative,'' and added, ``Its success
could be an adequate introduction to curb the dramatic developments
of the hostages issue.''
   In Norristown, Pa., one of Cicippio's brothers, Thomas Cicippio,
said he was not happy with the offer because it did not mention
freedom for the other foreigners held in Lebanon.
   Meanwhile, in the Lebanese town of Baalbek, Mousawi met with
foreign reporters and was asked what would happen if Obeid were not
freed.
   ``If we find out that the interests of Islam and Moslems and the
interests of the oppressed dictates that one of the Israeli
soldiers be killed, so will it be,'' he responded.
   He also said that if the United States ``is able to help itself
and help its hostages by stopping its support for Israel and by not
participating in anything that hurts Moslems in Lebanon... this
could encourage Hezbollah to think of a way to help resolve the
hostage issue.''
   Mousawi said some members of pro-Iranian organizations holding
hostages are ``known to us, and we hold consultations with them
from time to time.''
   It was the first time Hezbollah has publicly acknowledged it has
contacts with groups holding hostages.
   It has denied having anything to do with the abductions but is
generally believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem extremists
holding most of the captives.
   Mousawi also lauded the reported slaying of U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins, saying ``Bravo for the Oppressed on Earth,
because challenging the Islamic nation should not continue.'' But
he also said he could not confirm Higgins was dead.
   The pro-Iranian Organization for the Oppressed on Earth claimed
on July 31 that it had hanged Higgins because of Israel's refusal
to free Obeid. Higgins' body has not been found.
   There are 16 foreigners held hostage in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   Cicippio was acting comptroller at the American University in
Beirut when he was abducted. Tracy is a writer. His date of
abduction is unclear, but Revolutionary Justice claimed Oct. 21,
1986, that it had abducted him.
   The photograph with the statement Sunday showed Tracy from the
waist up. He wore a brown t-shirt, had a bushy white beard and was
smiling broadly as he looked into the camera.
   Elsewhere Sunday, U.N. mediator Marrack Goulding said families
of hostages in Lebanon should not lose hope and said there is a
``kind of subdued optimism'' about prospects for arranging a
hostage swap.
   He met Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk El Sharaa as part of his
effort to break the stalemate in the hostage crisis and to
determine Higgins' fate.

   Postal workers ended a three-day strike in
the southern province of Legnica Sunday but scattered work
stoppages continued in other parts of the country, according to
various reports.
   State television said the situation in the transport industry
remained uncertain.
   Rail workers staged a one-hour strike Saturday in Silesia that
idled about 80 passenger and freight trains.
   The workers have threatened a general rail strike if their
demand for basic pay of $96 per month is not met. The pay now is
about $60 a month.
   A meeting between the official OPZZ trade union, the independent
Solidarity union and transport officials is to be held Monday to
discuss demands by bus and rail workers, the official PAP news
agency said.
   State television said the postal workers in Legnica signed an
agreement with management Sunday, but it gave no details.
   A strike at a tire factory in the city of Grudziaz in northern
Poland continued and PAP said the workers' pay demands exceeded the
factory's financial reserves.
   Also reported were strikes by health workers in the city of
Lowicz and by tram-car operators in Walbrzych.
   Strikes are becoming frequent as workers demand pay increases to
cope with inflation that is expected to exceed 120 percent this
year.
   Some strikes are supported by the official trade union, some by
Solidarity and others by both unions.
   Over the weekend, several Solidarity activists from Warsaw went
to the provinces to meet with strikers and explain the independent
union's policies in Parliament toward labor disputes.
   Solidarity leaders have said the union recognizes the reasons
for the strikes but time is needed for reforms to be put into place.

<HEAD>Senior State Department Official Arrives In Khartoum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen
on Sunday began a visit to Sudan that will determine whether the
United States will give aid to the new military government.
   Cohen, the senior State Department official for African affairs,
told reporters his talks with Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir and
other Sudanese officials will cover the new government's plans for
ending a 6-year-old civil war and rebuilding the economy.
   Western sources said Cohen also will study el-Bashir's position
on allowing delivery of relief supplies to southerners suffering
from a war-induced famine. Both sides in the past have used food as
a weapon in the southern war.
   Cohen said the two days of talks will help the U.S. government
determine whether it should invoke a law that would freeze $108
million in aid because of the military's ouster of an elected
government.
   A 15-man junta overthrew Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi's
government on June 30. The coup made the country subject to a U.S.
law that stipulates aid must be halted to a country where a
democratically elected government is removed in violation of the
nation's constitution.
   Fiji was the first country to fall under the law in 1986, and
aid was halted. Sudan is the second.
   Western sources say $22 million in development and economic aid
to Sudan has been frozen since January because the country has not
paid dues on U.S. government loans for more than a year.
   The Bush administration meanwhile has made it clear that it will
continue humanitarian aid to Sudan, which amounted to $100 million
in the past year.
   Sudan is one of the world's poorest nations, and its economy has
been destroyed by the $1 million-a-day war in the south, where
minority Christians and animists are fighting for more autonomy
from the dominant Moslems of the north.
   Cohen opened his African tour in Cairo last week and flew to
Khartoum from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
expressed hope Sunday that a new era in U.S.-Mexican relations is
at hand after years of cross-border acrimony.
   Baker and four other members of the U.S. Cabinet came to Mexico
City for talks with Mexican officials.
   Baker told reporters accompanying him that relations with Mexico
were once in the category of ``managing irritants'' and his goal is
to ``create common opportunities'' between the two countries.
   ``I don't think the Unites States has a relationship that is any
more important than the relations with Mexico.,'' he said.
   He arrived here in late afternoon. The other Cabinet members
came to Mexico in another plane.
   Officials in Mexico City saw the presence of such a high-level
delegation as a reflection of the significance the Bush
administration attaches to laying the groundwork for a more
productive relationship with Mexico.
   About eight hours of talks are planned Monday on an array of
issues, but the dominant subjects are expected to be drug
enforcement and Mexico's economic prospects following a debt
reduction agreement reached two weeks ago.
   The meetings are being held under the auspices of the
U.S.-Mexico Binational Commission, and a State Department list
shows 41 participants from nine agencies in the U.S. delegation.
The commission was established eight years ago and serves as a
forum for regular meetings of cabinet officials from both countries.
   Besides Baker, other U.S. officials include Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Environmental Protection Agency
Administrator William Reilly, U.S. Trade Reprssentative Carla Hills
and the director of the U.S. Information Agency, Bruce Gelb.
   Presidents Bush and Carlos Salinas de Gortari are both relative
newcomers to their respective posts and the change in
administration in both countries seems to have contributed to an
improvement in relations.
   Under President Reagan, relations were dominated by mutual
recriminations over differing views on the conflict in Central
America, an issue that has faded in recent months.
   American officials also have praised Salinas for his handling of
Mexico's economic policies and evidence that he is serious about
grappling with cross-border drug smuggling.
   Living standards in Mexico have dropped precipitously over the
years, partly because of the country's repayment obligations on its
$100 billion foreign debt.
   But on July 23, an agreement was reached between the Mexican
goverment and the commercial banks to which Mexico owes most of its
debt. The agreement is expected to give Mexico some financial
breathing room by reducing annual debt payments of $10 billion to
$12 billion by more than $2 billion.
   The agenda for Monday's talks includes financial cooperation,
narcotics, immigration, law enforcement, the environment, border
cooperation and fisheries, trade and investment and cultural
relations.
   Baker flew to Mexico City from Houston Sunday afternoon. He was
to have dinner with Mexican Foreign Secretary Fernando Solana. A
luncheon with Salinas is scheduled for Monday.

   Thirty-eight rockets pounded Kabul
Sunday as Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze arrived in
the capital for talks with government officials. Nine people were
reported killed.
   Thirty-five people were injured, mainly in residential areas,
the Bakhtar news agency said. Four hospitals reported at least 52
injured.
   Guerrillas in the mountains ringing this city of 2.25 million
people started firing in the early morning, four hours before
Shevardnadze arrived from Moscow.
   It was one of the most intense barrages since the last Soviet
troops left Afghanistan on Feb. 15, leaving the government alone to
fight U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas.
   On July 10, Kabul was hit by 65 rockets that killed more than 30
people.
   Shevardnadze was expected to report to the Afghan government on
recent talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III, U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani on efforts to negotiate a political settlement
to Afghanistan's 10-year-old civil war.
   The Soviet minister held two meetings with President Najib,
Bakhtar reported.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, reported that Najib and
Shevardnadze discussed prospects of a political solution to the
conflict. It said the foreign minister also reaffirmed Soviet
economic and political support for Afghanistan.
   No further details on the talks were available.
   It was impossible for Shevardnadze to miss the almost continuous
explosions during the afternoon. The familiar boom of rockets sent
some Afghans rushing indoors, though others remained on the
streets, shopping, selling food, and trying to catch buses.
   No group claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack. But the
guerrillas have claimed responsibility for previous rocket attacks.
   The guerrillas say they aim at military targets and accuse the
government of rocketing civilian targets _ a charge the government
denies.
   On Sunday morning, several rockets struck the capital's
southwestern Darulaman area, where the Ministry of Defense is
located.
   More than 20 rockets exploded within a mile of the Continental
Hotel in northwest Kabul on Sunday afternoon. One landed in the
garden. Several struck a nearby hill, demolishing a house.
   A few landed near the British High Commission, which was
evacuated before the Soviet withdrawal.
   At least two struck near the main Kabul grain silo, where more
than 100 trucks were waiting to unload wheat.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani has accused
guerrillas of trying to destroy the silo, which contains 20,000
tons of grain, to starve the population.
   Kabul has been hit by almost daily rocket barrages since late
June. U.N. sources said 68 rockets hit the city in the last week,
not counting Sunday.
   Between June 25 and Aug. 1, the sources said, 281 residents were
killed and 745 injured in rocket attacks and a car bombing.
   Amani said published reports that an attempted coup has been
foiled and a number of generals arrested ``are baseless and have no
grounds.''
   He accused the United States and Pakistan, which help arm the
guerrillas, of fabricating the rumors to intensify what he called
its psychological warfare against the Afghan government.
   The Western campaign is aimed at whitewashing the guerrillas'
military failures and discord among its factions, Amani said.
   ``Except for the blind rocketing which is hitting the city,
there is nothing they can point to and be proud of,'' he said.

   Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement adopted a
proposal Sunday to establish a Palestinian currency to be backed
with gold donated by PLO supporters, the Palestinian news agency
Wafa reported.
   It said some 1,000 delegates attending Fatah's fifth general
congress voted unanimously in favor of the currency plan presented
by Arafat.
   Arafat is chairman of both the Palestine Liberation Organization
and of Fatah's Central Committee. Fatah is the largest group in the
PLO.
   Wafa said Palestinians would be asked to give gold rings or
other gold objects to provide reserves for the currency that will
be called the Palestinian pound. The report gave no indication when
the currency might begin circulating.
   The Fatah congress, the movement's first in nine years, has been
meeting behind closed doors since Thursday. It is scheduled to
finish Monday but some delegates said it might be extended for
several days.

<HEAD>Mississippi Legislative Commission Spied on Black Party Members in

<TEXT>
   A commission formed by the Mississippi
Legislature spied on members of a black political party during the
1960s in an effort to keep them out of office, according to a
former governor's personal papers.
   The 1956 Legislature formed the Sovereignty Commission to act as
the state's watchdog to preserve segregation. It was abolished in
1973 when then-Gov. Bill Waller vetoed its funding.
   The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party operated from 1964
until 1968 to provide alternative black candidates to the regular
party of the white-controlled state government.
   The spies compiled rosters of the party's supporters, obtained
records of its meetings and wrote elaborate reports about its
candidates' strategies, according to commission documents contained
in the papers of former Gov. Paul B. Johnson Jr.
   By Nov. 2, 1966, the commission had a list of 31 civil rights
supporters and the groups to which they belonged, including the
Freedom Democratic Party, according to papers of Johnson, who was
governor from 1964 to 1968.
   The documents in Johnson's papers came to light for the first
time after they were made available to The Clarion-Ledger in
Jackson in a July 28 agreement with the attorney general. The
Johnson papers are at a library at the University of Southern
Mississippi in Hattiesburg. The newspaper has not said how it
reached the agreement with the attorney general.
   ``To have been treated as a political threat, I feel
complimented,'' Lawrence Guyot, one of the 31 named, said in an
interview from his Washington home last week. ``The Sovereignty
Commission was concerned about destroying things. They wanted to
maintain the fear. ... They could only maintain their fear by
depriving people of the vote.
   ``We knew the meetings were being taped and people were acting
as human tapes,'' Guyot said.
   Educators and historians say the commission's files could lead
to the rewriting of state history books.
   For one, more people have claimed they fought for civil rights
than actually did, said Leslie McLemore, dean of Jackson State
University's graduate school of political science.
   As more commission documents come to light, ``you get a fairly
true picture of the participation,'' McLemore said. ``On the other
hand, you get people who were on the other side, trying to tone
down their conservative nature.''
   Charles Sallis, a history professor at Millsaps College in
Jackson, said he expects the files will show ``the kind of fascist
tactics whites were willing to use to preserve segregation.''

   Most Americans believe the United States should
negotiate with terrorists to free the Middle East hostages and
should refrain from bombing terrorist hideouts in Lebanon,
according to a poll released Sunday.
   Of the 500 people surveyed in the Time Magazine-Cable News
Network poll, 58 percent support negotiations while 39 percent
oppose such talks.
   Asked whether they support bombing terrorist hideouts in Lebanon
if innocent people might be killed, 60 percent said no, and 33
percent said yes.
   Seventy-six percent oppose paying ransom for hostages, versus 19
percent who approve of the ransom idea.
   When asked about sending in commandos to rescue the hostages on
a mission that could endanger lives, 50 percent rejected the plan
and 40 percent supported it.
   The respondents were evenly divided on whether the United States
should bomb targets in Iran because of Iran's link to the Lebanese
kidnappers, with 45 percent supporting such an action and 45
percent opposing it.
   Forty-six percent approve of the way President Bush has been
handling the hostage crisis, while 32 percent disapprove.
   Asked if Israel was justified in kidnapping Sheik Abdul Karim
Obeid, only 25 percent said yes; 53 percent said the action went
too far.
   A fourth of those polled said they believe Israel is partly
responsible for the death of U.S. Marine Lieut. Colonel William
Higgins, but one-half of the respondents said Higgins' Arab captors
were solely to blame for his execution.
   Higgins was kidnapped last year while heading an observer team
with the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon. His captors
claim they killed him last week in retaliation for Israel's
kidnapping of Sheik Obeid.
   The poll was conducted Aug. 3 by Yankelovich Clancy Shulman with
a sampling error estimated at plus or minus 4.5 percent.

   Unions representing 157,000 workers went on
strike against three regional telephone companies Sunday, slowing
local phone service in 15 states and the District of Columbia.
   Nine Southeastern states were spared telephone strikes as the
Communications Workers of America and BellSouth reached a tentative
agreement on a new, three-year contract late Saturday.
   But technicians, operators , clerical personnel, sales and
factory workers at NYNEX Corp., Bell Atlantic Corp. and Pacific
Telesis began strikes Sunday after talks failed.
   No talks were scheduled with NYNEX or Bell Atlantic, which
together provide telephone service to the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic regions.
   Informal talks were held Sunday in California between Pacific
Telesis, CWA and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, but no progress was reported.
   ``We are talking but we seem to be making very slow progress,''
said CWA spokeswoman Vira Milirides.
   No formal talks in any of the strikes were scheduled for Monday
but informal bargaining was expected to continue, with resumption
of fomal negotiations hinging on those discussions.
   People who dial direct should find little interruption in
service in the strike areas, company and union officials said.
   But consumers needing operator or directory assistance often
were greeted Sunday with recordings saying heavy call volume had
slowed service _ and that situation would worsen with the start of
the workweek Monday.
   Installations and repairs also would be slowed if the strikes
drag on and the companies try to operate with management personnel
in place of strikers.
   In all three strike situations, the unions and companies
remained well apart on the issues of wages and health insurance,
and a number of local issues remained unresolved in each set of
negotiations as well. The debate over health insurance has been the
major obstacle, with the unions resisting companies' efforts to
shift some costs to workers.
   The greatest differences appear to be between the unions and
NYNEX. That strike was called well before the midnight Saturday
deadline because the differences were so great no formal talks were
held Saturday.
   CWA represents 40,000 NYNEX workers and IBEW an additional
20,000. The company, based in New York, provides local phone
service in New York and the six New England states and went through
a nine-day strike three years ago.
   ``We were prepared for this and got our management teams out
there at midnight,''' said NYNEX spokesman John Bonomo. ``But
things may start to back up as we get the crunch on Monday.''
   At Pacific Telesis, the strike was called at midnight California
time _ 3 a.m. EDT _ but negotiations continued through much of the
night. The talks recessed Sunday morning but were expected to
resume although company officials said nothing was scheduled
officially. The company serves parts of California and all of
Nevada and employs 44,500 union workers, all but 2,500 of them CWA
members.
   The strike deadline at Bell Atlantic was extended as
negotiations continued past midnight Saturday but a walkout was
called just before 7 a.m. Sunday because of a lack of progress.
   Edward G. Grogan, Bell Atlantic's vice president of labor
relations, expressed disappointment the union had rejected a
``progressive settlement with a significant compensation package,
improved health care services and a long list of family care and
employment security provisions.''
   But the CWA's Bill Bickers said the company's offer of
``retrogressive wages and benefits is a slap in the face to all of
our members.''
   Bell Atlantic serves Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the nations capital. CWA
represents 41,000 Bell Atlantic workers, IBEW 11,500.
   The BellSouth agreement provides an immediate 4 percent pay
increase and cost of living adjustments in 1990 and 1991, BellSouth
officials said Sunday. The pact also provides for employees to
receive up to 12 months of child care leave and receive six months
of medical coverage while on leave.
   Three more of the so-called ``Baby Bells'' spawned by the 1984
breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph face strike deadlines at
the end of the week.
   Contracts expire Saturday at Ameritech, US West and Southwestern
Bell. Together, those companies employ 131,000 union workers in 24
states.

<HEAD>Study: Fewer Low-Birth-Weight Infants Die, But Infection A Big Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRIS CHANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More infants of low birth weight are dying from
infections than ever before, but the death rate among such babies
has dropped sharply, according to a federal researcher's study.
   A separate study conducted in Alabama concluded that
low-birth-weight babies living in rural sections of the state are
at greater risk of dying early than similar babies in cities.
   The number of low-birth-weight babies in the United States _
those born weighing 5{ pounds or less and often premature _ dropped
from 286,528 to 248,104 from 1969 to 1982, a 13 percent drop, said
the study by Dr. Janine Jason of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   Among whites, the mortality rate for such infants fell from 130
per 1,000 to 73 per 1,000 from 1969 to 1982, the latest year for
which figures are available. For blacks, the rate fell from 122 per
1,000 to 72.
   The study, which examined 25,000 deaths recorded during the
period, did not cite an overall death rate.
   Infectious diseases, which were associated with 4 percent of the
deaths in 1969, accounted for 10 percent by 1982, the study said.
   One reason is that low-birth-weight babies are surviving long
enough to contract infectious diseases, Jason said. She said some
parents may not understand the seriousness of an infectious disease
or have the money or transportation to bring the child to the
hospital.
   ``This is especially worrisome because infectious diseases are a
potentially preventable cause of death,'' Jason wrote in the study,
published in the August edition of Pediatrics, the journal of the
American Academy of Pediatrics, based in suburban Elk Grove Village.
   Most of the babies die of respiratory failure or other physical
problems that occur because of inadequate physical development,
according to the study.
   In the Alabama study, which was also published in Pediatrics,
researchers said they suspect living conditions and lack of access
to hospitals are responsible for the greater risk to
low-birth-weight babies living in rural areas.
   The study, conducted between 1980 and 1983, found 15,969
low-weight-births during the period, with 13.1 deaths per 1,000
births. The rate in racial terms was 10.82 deaths per 1,000 for
whites and 15.84 deaths per 1,000 for blacks.
   Overall, the death rate of rural low birth rate babies was 14
per 1,000 compared to 12.9 per 1,000 for urban babies.
   The 40 percent of Alabama's population that live in rural areas,
especially blacks, have housing that is ``substantially worse than
that in some Third World countries,'' said Dr. Christiane Hale of
the University of Alabama.
   Hale and another researcher found that many parts of rural
Alabama have no indoor plumbing or running water.
   ``If there's no refrigerator, there's no way to keep formula
chilled, which leads to infection,'' Hale said.

<HEAD>Reports Cuban Official Killed Self Because of Drug Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the financial section of Cuba's
Interior Ministry killed himself because of ``dejection and shame''
over a drug scandal involving the ministry, a Mexican news agency
said Sunday.
   But the report in Notimex, the official Mexican agency, did not
say how or when Col. Rafael Alvarez Cueto committed suicide.
   It attributed its dispatch to a report published Sunday in
Havana in the Cuban newspaper Rebel Youth.
   The report said Alvarez Cueto left two letters expressing
``confidence in the revolution and in President Fidel Castro'' and
``dejection and shame'' at the drug scandal that sent four high
officials to the firing squad and 10 to prison.
   They were convicted of helping smuggle tons of drugs into the
United States in collusion with Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Two of those executed by firing squads on July 13 were Interior
Ministry officials. The two others shot were army officers
including a highly decorated general who had commanded Cuban troops
serving in Angola to help that country's Marxist government battle
rebels.
   The article in Rebel Youth indicated that Alvarez Cueto had not
been implicated in the scandal. It said Alvarez Cueto was allowed
to keep his job while Interior Minister Jose Abrantes Fernandez and
other ministry officials were removed from their posts.
   Abrantes Fernandez was not among the 14 people court-martialed
in the drug scandal but apparently was removed because of the
corruption that occurred in his ministry.
   The military court was told that the army and ministry officials
involved in the drug scandal put official resources at the disposal
of drug traffickers, who moved tons of Colombian cocaine and
Jamaican marijuana through the Caribbean into the United States.
   Castro's Communist government has called the scandal, the
biggest since Castro took power in 1959, a betrayal of the ideals
of the Cuban revolution and a cancer that will be excised from
Cuban society.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Justice Assails Neglect of Federal Judiciary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy criticized
the ``assault by neglect'' on the federal judiciary in the wake of
Congress' rejection of pay hikes for federal judges.
   Although Kennedy did not specifically mention the rejection last
March of the 50 percent pay hike, he told the American Bar
Association convention on Saturday that federal judges had suffered
``a devestating blow.''
   ``This is assault by neglect and I am confident that if this
situation remains unremedied, the integrity, the independence and
the traditions of the American judiciary will be compromised in a
way that is not likely to be undone,'' Kennedy said.
   ``The federal judiciary cannot retain its integrity and its
independence and its strength unless it can draw on the highest
ranks of the practicing legal profession to serve as judges on this
bench at the height of their careers,'' he said.
   He said the Supreme Court was not included in his assessment
``because we are in a special situation.''
   U.S. District Court judges earn $89,500 annually, while federal
appeals court judges earn $95,000 a year. Those on the Supreme
Court earn $110,000 annually, with the chief justice earning an
extra $5,000.
   The rejected pay raise was part of a package that included
salary hikes for Congress and administration officials.
   Kennedy made his remarks during an ABA panel discussion on
alternative ways to resolve disputes. Also on the panel were
Supreme Court Justice Byron White and Hawaii Supreme Court Chief
Justice Herman Lum.
   White said the backlog of court cases makes it imperative to
find other ways of resolving disputes.
   In federal courts alone, about 269,000 cases, or about 470 for
each of the 575 district court judges, were filed in the year
ending June 30, 1988, he said.
   One alternative in civil cases is the use of ``summary jury
trials'' in which a six-member jury returns a non-binding, advisory
verdict to help each side evaluate its case and encourage a
settlement, White said.
   In Hawaii in the past three years, 2,000 personal injury cases
have been resolved through mandatory, non-binding arbitration, Lum
said.
   The judiciary's Center for Alternative Dispute Resolution has
helped settle or streamline almost 50 complicated, multi-party
cases, he said.

Cabinet members chosen; picks up 16th pvs, `Paz Zamora...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER MCFARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, BOLIVIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new generation of political leaders
took over in Bolivia Sunday with Jaime Paz Zamora installed as
president, even though he came in third in general elections in May.
   President Victor Paz Estenssoro, 82, turned over the government
to his nephew at a ceremony in Congress.
   Paz Zamora, 50, was elected Saturday by Congress after he formed
an alliance Wednesday with former military dictator Hugo Banzer
Suarez.
   None of the candidates received a majority of the vote in the
May 7 election and under the constitution the Congress then elects
the president from the top three vote getters.
   Luis Ossio Sanjines, leader of the Christian Democratic Party
and a Banzer ally, is the new vice president. He and Paz Zamora
will serve four-year terms.
   In his inaugural address, Paz Zamora said the pact with Banzer,
his former adversary, ``signals that new winds are blowing in
Bolivia.''
   He said his government will maintain a free market economy with
an emphasis on developing the agricultural sector and small and
medium-sized industries. His administration also will continue the
economic stabilization program by maintaining a floating exchange
rate, pegging prices to supply and demand and attracting foreign
investments, the president said.
   Attending the inauguration were the presidents of Argentina,
Brazil, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay. Representing the Unites
States were Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos and Prescott Bush,
President Bush's brother.
   Paz Zamora heads the Movement of the Revolutionary Left. His
alliance with Banzer, leader of the conservative Nationalist
Democratic Action Party, surprised many Bolivians and caused a
brief run on banks last week.
   Paz Estenssoro's Nationalist Revolutionary Movement has been the
most influential political force in the last 40 years and he has
served four times as president.
   Paz Estenssoro told the new administration, ``We are turning
over the government with a healthy economy and in much better shape
than it was four years ago.''
   When Paz Estenssoro took office in 1985 he fired 23,000
government-employed miners and imposed a ten-fold increase in the
price of gasoline and a wage freeze. The measures lowered inflation
from 24,000 percent in 1985 to a predicted 6 percent for 1989.
   Paz Zamora is expected to bring into the government a new wave
of political and economic leaders, including many educated in the
United States and Europe.
   In May's presidential election, Paz Zamora won 19 percent of the
vote, Banzer 23 percent and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the
Nationalist Revolutionary Movement 24 percent.
   Banzer, a former army general, came to power following a coup in
1971. In 1974 Paz Zamora was accused of plotting to overthrow the
government and was jailed for six months. Banzer stepped down in
1978 and became active in the democratic process.
   Paz Zamora's Cabinet was sworn in Sunday night with nine members
from his party and nine from Banzer's political organization.
   Carlos Iturralde, a wealthy mining executive and ambassador to
Washington during Banzer's rule, was named foreign minister. He
said one of his top priorities will be to ``wage a frontal battle
against the cocaine trade.''
   Paz Zamora was a vice presidential candidate in the 1980
elections after his party formed a coalition with the Communist
Party and the Leftist Revolutionary Nationalist Movement under the
leadership of Hernan Siles Zuazo.
   The coalition won a majority, but a military coup blocked Siles
Zuazo and Paz Zamora from taking office. In 1982, the military
stepped down.
   Siles Zuazo and Paz Zamora resigned in 1985, a year before their
term expired, because of social unrest and political pressure.
   Sunday's inauguration marked the first time in 25 years that a
government has completed its term and turned over power to a
democratically elected administration.

   A man has been executed in southeastern China for
murdering a member of the National Congress last June, an official
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Beijing Daily said Yuan Zihu was executed Saturday in Yongan
city in Fujian province after a court found him guilty of killing
38-year-old Feng Yimiao on June 6. It did not give Yuan's age.
   Yuan, who had earlier served a prison sentence for theft,
climbed a drain pipe and went through a window to burglarize the
government guesthouse where Ms. Feng was staying during a business
trip, the report said.
   It said Ms. Feng, a member of the national legislature and
general manager of a department store, was killed when she screamed
as Yuan entered her room.
   The Beijing Daily report did not indicate any connection between
Ms. Feng's political position and her murder.

   A young man who had claimed he was the
kidnapped son of a Florida couple has fled the country, admitting
that he assumed the son's identity after the boy was killed while
trying to escape a baby-selling ring.
   In an interview published Sunday in The Buffalo News, David
Bonnabel, 25, admitted his story was a ``stretch of the truth,''
but said he was only trying to bring to justice a baby-selling ring
that killed young girls and his closest friend.
   Associates and law enforcement officials said Bonnabel, who
claimed he was abducted as a child and held captive for more than
10 years in the Louisiana bayou, is nothing more than a talented
con man who has fled the country.
   ``The whole thing had a purpose,'' Bonnabel said during a
telephone phone interview from a Latin American city. ``But
everything got out of hand.''
   The couple whose son Bonnabel pretended to be, Joseph and
Marjean Hagans of Tallahassee, said they believe he is a Mexican
national who used them as part of an elaborate scheme to prove he
was an American.
   And they still wonder what happened to their son Jonathan, who
was three when he disappeared from a Florida beach 21 years ago.
   Originally, Bonnabel claimed he was kidnapped at age 3 and kept
captive in a trailer in Louisiana. Now, he says he is a native of
Guadalajara, Mexico, of French descent, who entered the U.S.
illegally as a teenage dropout.
   He says he was confined against his will in Louisiana in 1981,
at which time he met a 15-year-old boy named Jonathan whom his
captor claimed was her son. Bonnabel says he soon realized Jonathan
had been kidnapped by the woman and was being sexually and
physically abused and kept out of school.
   After several months in the Louisiana trailer, Bonnabel claims
he realized that the woman was a midwife who delivered the babies
of pregnant girls and sold them on the black market. He also claims
he and Jonathan witnessed the murder of one girl.
   Eventually, he said, after Jonathan was killed in an escape
attempt, he claimed Jonathan's identity as his own.
   Bonnabel now claims that, while conducting an extensive search
for his own parents, he realized that telling a ``white lie''
substituting himself for Jonathan would attract more attention.
   ``Then the publicity got out of hand,'' he said. ``But I played
along from that moment on. It was the only resource I had to get
help.''
   The Haganses flew Bonnabel to Florida for a reunion before
realizing he wasn't their son.
   Mrs. Hagans said she believes Bonnabel was ``involved in
something bad. Whether or not my Jonathan was involved, I do not
know.'' Now, she said, ``I hope he (Bonnabel) doesn't come back.''
   Carol Boyette, a relative of the Hagans family and an activist
in missing-persons causes, said Bonnabel finally recanted his story
because of overwhelming evidence and the threat of a blood test.

   Nintendo of America Inc. has filed suit
against a large video rental chain for allegedly photocopying
Nintendo video game instruction manuals and providing them to
rental customers.
   Fort Lauderdale-based Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. was named
in a copyright injunction lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Newark, N.J., Nintendo announced Friday.
   The lawsuit is ``the first of those which Nintendo will commence
to stop this illegal practice,'' said Nintendo attorney Lynn
Hvalsoe in a company release.
   Blockbuster spokesman Wally Knief said Friday that company
attorneys had not reviewed the suit and it was too early for
comment.
   Blockbuster operates 821 video-rental outlets in 42 states,
Knief said.
   Instruction pamphlets are included with video game cartridge
packages. The suit contends that Blockbuster has photocopied these
pamphlets and distributed them to customers who rent the games.
   Nintendo of America is based in Redmond, Wash. and is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Japan-based Nintendo Co. Ltd.

   Nearly 300 Wells Fargo &amp; Co. employees have
told the bank they would quit instead of work new evening and
weekend hours, bank officials said.
   About 5 percent of the branch employees said they would quit

stating that they must either work the new hours or leave the bank.
   Earlier this year, Wells Fargo expanded its hours. Branches are
now until 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and on Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. The bank previously stayed open until 4 p.m. on Monday
through Thursday and until 6 p.m on Friday, and was closed Saturday.
   The new hours require that employees work some evening hours and
Saturday shifts. However, they were not required to put in a longer

<HEAD>Toyota Luxury Car Aims at Gap Between Americans, Europeans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Toyota's new Lexus LS 400 luxury sedan may cause
people to think twice about buying more expensive European cars _
even Mercedes-Benz and BMW models _ an industry analyst says.
   ``There is a certain cachet to something made in the Black
Forest, but how much more is one willing to pay for that cachet?
Maybe there are fewer people willing to pay more,'' said Mary Ann
Sudol, an analyst for Fitch Investor Service in New York.
   Reporters got a look at the Lexus cars Friday at a racetrack in
California. They are scheduled for introduction in dealer showrooms
Sept. 1.
   The first 1,000 vehicles were shipped to dealers Wednesday, said
Dave Illingworth, Lexus' vice president and general manager.
   The LS 400 will have a base price of $35,000. Illingworth said
most American luxury cars fall in the $20,000 to $30,000 range,
while many European luxury cars cost more than $40,000.
   ``Our game plan is to be right between the two,'' he said.
   The Lexus LS 400 is Toyota's first V-8 four-door luxury sedan.
The car has 250 horsepower and a top speed of 150 mph.
   With options such as leather seats, compact-disc changers and
dealer-installed cellular phones, LS 400s are expected to cost
about $38,000, Illingworth said.
   That was the price announced earlier this week for Nissan Motor
Corp.'s V-8-powered Infiniti Q45 sedan, slated to appear in
showrooms Nov. 8. The Infiniti's price includes all options.
   The new Japanese contenders are bound to catch the eye of
habitual European luxury model purchasers, Sudol said.
   ``In style and features and power they seem to be saying, `Look
what elegance and appearance and value you can have for about half
the price,''' Sudol said.
   Lexus also will offer a 156-horsepower, V-6-powered four-door
sedan called the ES 250 with a base price of $21,050.

<HEAD>Indictment Alleges Thrift Provided Prostitutes, Trips to S&amp;L Commissioner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal indictment alleges that executives of a
troubled savings and loan used customers' funds to provide
prostitutes, hunting trips and other perks to a former Texas
savings and loan commissioner while he supervised the Dallas thrift.
   The 37-count indictment also alleges that Patrick G. King,
former president of Vernon Savings Association, illegally used the
thrift's money to to make $55,000 worth of political contributions
to several congressmen, including former House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Jack Kemp, R-New York.
   King is scheduled to be tried Monday on federal charges of
conspiracy, misapplication of funds and making false entries on
Vernon's books in connection with the use of thrift money. He has
pleaded innocent.
   King was the state's deputy thrift commissioner before he joined
Vernon.
   Prosecution documents filed Thursday detail the alleged use of
Vernon funds to provide female escorts, lavish trips and other
entertainment for former thrift commissioner L. Linton Bowman III,
Vernon Savings owner Don R. Dixon, King and other Vernon officials,
The Dallas Morning News reported.
   But King's attorney, Emmett Colvin of Dallas, filed motions
contending prostitution-hiring charges may have been improperly
handled because Bowman was impotent at the time of the alleged
incidents.
   King was employed by the savings and loan commission under
Bowman's supervision, eventually becoming deputy commissioner,
before joining Vernon in 1983.
   Bowman was appointed state savings and loan commissioner in
1983, presiding over the Texas thrift industry until November 1987,
when he resigned. Vernon Savings was closed by federal regulators
that month, with losses totaling more than $1.3 billion.
   Prosecutors allege that shortly after King was hired at Vernon,
he set up several excursions that included paid female
companionship for his former boss at Dixon's request.
   The alleged excursions reportedly continued from January 1985 to
January 1986, while state regulators _ under Bowman's supervision _
and federal thrift examiners became increasingly critical of
speculative lending, insider dealings and other questionable
practices at Vernon.
   A defense motion filed Thursday suggests that government
prosecutors may have misled the federal grand jury that indicted
King by failing to tell them that Bowman was impotent at the time
the women were hired.
   U.S. Justice Department prosecutors Robert E. Hauberg Jr. and
Stephen P. Learned acknowledged in a letter July 24 that they knew
about Bowman's impotence but did not reveal it to the grand jury.
   But prosecutors contended in the letter to King's lawyer that
Bowman's condition was kept confidential at his attorney's request
and is not an issue in King's case.
   ``Whether or not Mr. Bowman ... had the capacity, the desire or
the charm needed to engage in sex, given the opportunity to share
paid female companionship, is irrelevant to a misappropriation of
bank funds ... ,'' the prosecutors' letter says.
   Bowman could not be reached for comment. A secretary at his
Austin consulting office told the newspaper he was traveling and
could not be reached. Repeated telephone calls to his home and
office were not returned Friday.

   Fruehauf Corp. is no more, after changing
its name to K-H Corp. as part of the automotive parts
manufacturer's sale of its truck trailer and maritime businesses.
   The company completed the name change at the close of business
Friday, it said in a news release from its suburban Detroit
headquarters. The name change was required under terms of the July
14 sale of its subsidiaries.
   On May 5, Toronto-based Varity Corp. agreed to buy Fruehauf for
$436 million and 55.5 million shares of Varity stock.
   The name change won't affect that takeover, K-H said in a news
release. The takeover is expected to be completed by the end of
September, said Robert Siefert, K-H's president.
   In March, a division of Terex Corp. agreed to buy Freuhauf's
truck trailer and maritime manufacturing operations for about $233
million.
   K-H now principally serves as a holding company for Kelsey-Hayes
Co., a maker of aluminum and steel wheels, brake parts and other
car and truck components.
   K-H will trade on the New York Stock exchange under the ticker
symbol KH, the company said.
   Fruehauf encountered severe financial difficulties after a
leveraged buyout in 1986, to avoid a hostile takeover, left the
company heavily indebted.
