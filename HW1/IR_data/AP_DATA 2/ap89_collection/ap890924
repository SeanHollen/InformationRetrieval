<HEAD>Bush to Call for Major Chemical Weapons Reductions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a major arms control
initiative, will tell the United Nations on Monday that he is
prepared to slash U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles by more than 50
percent provided the Soviet Union make similar reductions in their
own arsenals of the deadly weapons, administration sources said
Sunday night.
   The proposal, in Bush's first speech as president to the U.N.
General Assembly on Monday, is part of a stepped-up U.S. drive to
slow or even stop the spread of chemical weapons around the world.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III informed Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the president's intention in
their talks over the weekend in Jackson Hole, Wyo. There the two
sides agreed on a two-stage U.S.-Soviet program to exchange
information about their chemical weapons and to inspect each
other's plants and arsenals.
   But, the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
superpowers were faced with the bigger problem of halting the
spread of the weapons to other countries, including in stabile
regimes in the Third World. Some two dozen countries are believed
to possess chemical weapons or have the capacity to produce them.
   First disclosure of Bush's initiative came in Monday's editions
of the New York Times. The sources, confirming the thrust of the
newspaper's account, said Bush also would suggest sanctions against
countries which proceed with chemical weapons production.

   President Bush, in his first
presidential address to the United Nations, will announce a major
initiative to cut chemical weapons arsenals by more than 50 percent
providing the Soviet Union do the same, administration sources said
Sunday night.
   The president, in between church services, fishing and golf,
worked with his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and
other aides Sunday at his seaside vacation home to finish the
speech to be delivered Monday.
   The central focus of the speech is to be a proposal that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said would ``move the world
closer to a ban on chemical weapons.''
   It is part of a stepped-up U.S. drive to slow or even stop the
spread of chemical weapons around the world.
   Baker informed Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of
the president's intention in their talks over the weekend in
Jackson Hole, Wyo. There the two sides agreed on a two-stage
U.S.-Soviet program to exchange information about their chemical
weapons and to inspect each other's plants and arsenals.
   But, the sources, who spoke in New York on condition of
anonymity, said the superpowers were faced with the bigger problem
of halting the spread of the weapons to other countries, including
in stabile regimes in the Third World. Some two dozen countries are
believed to possess chemical weapons or have the capacity to
produce them.
   First disclosure of Bush's initiative came in Monday's editions
of the New York Times. The sources, confirming the thrust of the
newspaper's account, said Bush also would suggest sanctions against
countries which proceed with chemical weapons production.
   The New York Times said the United States was believed to have
about 30,000 tons of chemical weapons, while the Soviet Union says
it has 50,000 tons. Western nations say the Soviets actually may
have more than 300,000 tons.
   The U.S. proposal is intended to spur progress in negotiations
in Geneva, where 40 nations are trying to reach a global agreement
on chemical weapons.
   One official traveling with the president described Bush's
proposal as a challenge to the Soviet Union to join the United
States in action on chemical weapons.
   Another official called the plan ``a new initiative to move
forward in elimination of chemical weapons, to reduce stockpiles
and generally try to give a new impetus to a total ban.''
   White House officials were tight lipped on what that proposal
would contain.
   ``The president has been concerned for a number of years about
the horrors of chemical weapons. He made a major presentation to
the U.N. conference in 1984, on the possibility of banning chemical
weapons and he will have some proposals tomorrow to advance that
issue,'' Scowcroft said Sunday on the NBC show ``Meet the Press.''
   The United States and Soviet Union are the only two nations that
admit to having chemical weapons stockpiles. However, U.S. analysts
estimate two dozen countries have the weapons or the capacity to
produce them.
   Bush's speechwriters completed a draft of his U.N. address
Saturday night following announcement of several accords, and plans
for a superpower summit, as a result of two days of talks in
Wyoming between Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Among the accords was an agreement to exchange data on chemical
weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by inspectors of
the other side to stockpiles and plants by June 30. In a second
phase, there would be more intensive on-site inspections of the
submitted data.
   In addition to the chemical weapons proposal, Scowcroft said,
``The thrust of the U.N. speech will be celebrating the march of
democracy and freedom, dealing with many of the multilateral issues
affecting the world _ drugs, terrorism, environment.''
   The president is expected to include one of his favorite themes,
the moves toward political and economic reform in Poland and other
East bloc countries.
   At the U.N., where Bush served as the U.S. ambassador in 1971
and 1972, the president will hold several bilateral meetings and
will meet with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   He also will meet with Brazil's President Jose Sarney, Israeli
Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres, Guatemalan President Vinicio
Cerezo, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez and Bolivian
President Jaime Paz Zamora.
   Bush will host a lunch for NATO allies, and with his wife
Barbara, also will visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a
diplomatic reception and dinner during their busy day in New York.
   Cramming in as much recreation as possible before heading to New
York Monday morning, Bush pitched horseshoes Sunday along with
golfing and fishing.

   Rockwell International Corp.'s sudden withdrawal
from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant won't affect
environmental safety agreements or investigations into hazardous
waste disposal, regulators said.
   The Department of Energy announced Friday that Rockwell had
terminated its $2.5 billion, five-year contract after 14 years.
EG&amp;G Inc., based in Wellesley, Mass., is to take over management of
the plant Monday. Rockwell maintained it was impossible to follow
both its contract with DOE and the waste disposal rules of the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``Any new contractor will have to live by the same agreement
that Rockwell does,'' said Jim Scherer, regional administrator of
the EPA. A state Health Department official also said the same
rules would apply.
   EG&amp;G Chairman John Kucharski said Saturday he planned to send
representatives Monday to Washington and Colorado to ``talk through
a series of issues'' with Energy Department and Rockwell officials.
   ``At this point it's rather flattering to be asked to do
something like this, but it's too early to comment on what we can
and cannot do,'' he said.
   Rockwell's departure culminated an increasingly bitter dispute
between the El Segundo, Calif.-based company and state and federal
agencies over disposal of hazardous waste generated by production
of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   In June, after the federal raid at the plant, Colorado cited
Rocky Flats for 25 violations of hazardous wastes laws, and Gov.
Roy Romer threatened to close the plant unless it was opened to
state officials for environmental monitoring tests.
   That same month, EPA and FBI agents raided the plant, looking
for evidence of alleged illegal hazardous waste disposal. A federal
grand jury will continue its work in that case, the Justice
Department said.
   The Sierra Club has filed suit against the Energy Department to
stop incineration of radioactive waste at the plant.
   The day before Rockwell bowed out of the plant, it sued the
Energy and Justice departments, alleging that conflicting federal
regulations required it to violate some hazardous waste laws to
comply with the contract.

<HEAD>Two Bombs Injuring Two, Army Reportedly Knows Galan's Killers</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES with two bombs injuring two people</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two bombs exploded in the capital
Saturday night, injuring two people, in a continuing wave of
violence blamed on drug traffickers.
   Also Saturday, newspapers quoted an army general as saying two
men confessed to killing Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, whose
assassination led the government to declare war on drug kingpins,
and that the army also knows who hired the alleged assassins.
   One explosion occurred in a downtown movie theater, slightly
injuring one man, authorities said. The other blast damaged a
government-owned bus terminal in the northeast portion of the city.
One man was injured.
   Authorities arrested several people in connection with the
bombings, officials said.
   Since Aug. 23, drug traffickers declared a ``total war'' after
the government the crackdown, and officials have blamed them for
102 bombings and arson attacks that killed six people and injured
129.
   Bogota's half-dozen newspapers said Gen. Ramon Niebles did not
disclose who ordered the killing of Galan. Niebles made the claim
Friday at a news conference.
   Galan was leading the presidential race when he was shot down at
a Bogota rally Aug. 18. The government responded with a crackdown
on trafficking and drug lords retaliated with daily bombings and
shootings.
   The two men who confessed to killing Galan were part of a band
called The Blackies, the army general was quoted as saying. Two
other men in the band are thought to have set off a 500-pound bomb
Sept. 2 that seriously damaged the Bogota daily El Espectador.
   The four men were captured Thursday in a house in Bogota where
the army found weapons, ammunition and 220 pounds of dynamite
packed under a car seat, the general said.
   Twice before, police have said they captured Galan's killers _
once five men and once 11 men. Both times the suspects were
released after a few days.
   The army has a reputation of forcing confessions from people who
later recant in civilian courts. Colombia's armed forces have the
authority to arrest and detain people under a state of siege that
has existed in Colombia for all but a few months of the last 40
years.
   The president of Colombia's House of Representatives, Norberto
Morales, told a news conference Friday in Medellin that he was
telephoned by Pablo Escobar and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, kingpins
of the infamous Medellin cartel.
   A tape recording of the news conference was broadcast Saturday
by Bogota radio stations. There was no answer at Morales' office in
Medellin.
   The Medellin cartel is believed responsible for 80 percent of
the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.
   Morales said Escobar and Rodriguez Gacha offered to invest
millions of dollars in Colombian industry if a truce is reached. He
said he had passed the information along to President Virgilio
Barco.
   This would not be the first time that Escobar, Rodriguez and
other suspected members of the Medellin cartel have tried to buy
amnesty.
   In 1984, President Belisario Betancur even sent former President
Alfonso Lopez Michelsen to Panama to meet with members of the
cartel. The cartel offered to pay off Colombia's foreign debt, then
about $10 billion, if Colombia would end the war declared on drug
traffickers after Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was
murdered.
   The government rejected the offer, but a few weeks later the
army stopped confiscating property of suspected traffickers.
   Medellin Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez, has been the biggest
advocate of negotiations with drug traffickers.
   A U.S. Embassy official said earlier this month that the
traffickers' specific demands have included full pardons in
exchange for removing all of their drug operations from Colombia,
perhaps to Bolivia and Peru.
   The officials also said that traffickers offered to invest part
of their fortunes in helping government security forces rid the
country of leftist guerrillas.
   Barco has refused to conduct negotiatons with the traffickers.
   Forbes Magazine recently ranked Escobar as having between $2
billion and $3 billion. Colombian media have reported that all five
members of the Medellin cartel are billionaires.
   The U.S. Justice Department has given priority to the capture
and extradition of 12 Colombians facing drug charges in the United
States, including Escobar and Rodriguez. None of the 12 has been
captured.

   A fundamentalist school principal was
convicted of assault for paddling a 7-year-old student until the
child was bruised.
   A jury meeting Friday said that David L. Douglass, 37, principal
of Mountain View Christian School, used excessive force when he
paddled the hyperactive boy for talking in class last year.
   Douglass faces up to two years in prison and a $5,000 fine for
the simple assault conviction.
   The trial focused on the degree of pain caused by the paddling.
Under the law, a teacher or parent can be convicted of assaulting a
child if extreme pain, mental distress or bodily injury was
inflicted.
   A doctor who attended the boy shortly after the spanking said
the momentary pain of each whack against the bruised skin was
equivalent to the pain of a lighted cigarette.

<HEAD>Man Sues for Life Insurance of Girlfriend</HEAD>

   A man who pleaded guilty to homicide in
his girlfriend's death has filed a lawsuit to collect a $
</TEXT>
<NOTE>10,000</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   share of her life insurance benefits.
   Paul Britton, 41, pleaded guilty in February to criminally
negligent homicide in the death of Donna Staniec, 27, admitting
only that he slapped the woman two days before she died. A medical
expert testified that Ms. Staniec died of head injuries in a fall
or from a blow with an object.
   Britton's lawsuit contends that he is entitled to the money as
co-beneficiary on Ms. Staniec's $20,000 policy because he never
admitted to intentionally causing her death in 1987.
   Britton's lawsuit, scheduled for hearing Monday, contends that
he is entitled to the money as co-beneficiary on Ms. Staniec's
$20,000 policy because he never admitted to intentionally causing
her death.
   ``I think it's just sick that a cold-blooded killer can do
this,'' said Kathy Proulx, Ms. Staniec's sister.
   Britton was placed on probation in February, but he later was
sentenced to one to four years in prison for violating probation by
assaulting his new girlfriend. He is free on $2,500 bond pending
appeal.
   Ms. Staniec's mother, Ann Staniec, is the other beneficiary
named in the policy with Aetna Life Insurance Co. She already has
received her $10,000 share.
   Britton's lawyer, Robert Tisdell, said his client deserves the
money regardless of his guilty plea.
   ``He's the beneficiary. I don't feel they can deny paying him,''
Tisdell said. ``If it was intentional he couldn't collect, and I
never would have brought the lawsuit.''
   Mark Williams, a lawyer for Aetna, which is challenging the
request, said the insurance company believes there is evidence that
Britton intended to kill Ms. Staniec.
   ``When there's an intentional killing, the beneficiary forfeits
his rights to the proceeds,'' Williams said.
   Ms. Staniec's mother was outraged.
   ``He admitted he killed her and now he wants the money? ``I
think it's disgusting. He's got one heck of a nerve.''

   A twin-engine plane exploded and tumbled
into a dam in southern India and all 11 people aboard were feared
dead, airline officials said Sunday.
   Officials of the domestic carrier Vayudoot said the Dornier
aircraft exploded Saturday night about half an hour after takeoff
from Poona airport and fell into the Unani dam on the Bhima River,
about 90 miles away.
   Police and investigators ruled out any chances of survivors
among the eight passengers and three crew members on the hourlong
flight to Hyderabad. The names of the victims were not released,
but the airline said all aboard were Indian.
   Rescue teams were searching for bodies and trying to retrieve
the aircraft's fuselage from 30 feet of water, officials said.
   Aviation investigators were sent to the dam, near the village of
Warangal. They said they hoped to find out whether the explosion
was accidental or sabotage.
   Vayudoot operates short routes, mainly in northeastern India.
The airline, like India's other two carriers, Indian Airlines and
Air India, are operated by the government.
   The last major accident involving a Vayudoot plane occured on
Oct. 19, 1988, when a Fokker Friendship plane slammed into a
mountain in northeastern India during a torrential rainstorm and
killed all 34 people on board.

   Residents in this storm-ravaged city
lined up for blocks Sunday to get a hot meal, and churches around
the state began collecting money, food and clothing to aid the
thousands of victims of Hurricane Hugo's wrath.
   With power out a third day, many residents were unable to cook
food, boil water for drinking or even get cash from electronic bank
teller machines. At stores that managed to open, lines snaked for
as long as four hours. The city late Saturday enacted an emergency
law to stop price-gouging.
   The American Red Cross had 32 lunch wagons distributing hot food
to people in Charleston on Sunday, said Brian Ruberry, media
manager of the organization.
   The Red Cross bought the food, and church members were cooking
it at the Citadel Square Baptist Church, Ruberry said. A line of
people waiting for food stretched three blocks.
   A prayer service was scheduled Sunday at St. Philip's Episcopal
Church, a 17th century church that lost a door and a copper roof as
the storm hammered the historic city late Thursday and early Friday.
   At St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Mount Pleasant, across the
harbor from Charleston, people were hugging one another on the
portico as they gathered for morning services Sunday. Nearby, storm
damage was apparent, with massive oaks blocking a road, and damage
to homes visible.
   Inland, churches in Columbia were collecting items to send to
communities badly damaged to the south.
   Hospitals in Charleston were still operating on generators
Sunday, but South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. hoped to have
electricity restored to five hospitals by the end of the day,
spokeswoman Mary Green Brown said.
   By Sunday morning, traffic in Charleston was heavy, apparently
including some sightseers. In the city's famed historic district,
the hum of generators indicated residents were working to clean up
the mess the storm left.
   Damage in the state could top $3 billion, according to tourism
and city officials.
   In North Carolina, Gov. Jim Martin sent 200 National Guard and
other security officers to Charlotte and asked President Bush to
declare a federal disaster area in 51 North Carolina counties. Bush
already declared several South Carolina counties disaster areas.
   The hurricane left at least 27 people dead in the Caribbean and
was blamed for an additional 24 deaths in the Carolinas, Virginia
and New York.
   The deaths included a woman and her two children who were killed
Sunday in rural Clarendon County when their wood-frame house caught
fire. Careless use of candles, which were being used because the
family had no electricty, was blamed for the fire, said county Fire
Chief Carter Jones.
   Authorities reported 20 incidents of looting and 30 arrests in
North Carolina since Hugo struck; 89 arrests were made in South
Carolina, including 27 in Charleston, where the National Guard
began patrolling Friday.
   The troops will remain on the streets of Charleston ``just as
long as we need to to maintain the safety for people,'' South
Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said.
   At least 960,000 people in the Carolinas remained without power
as of Saturday, and utility officials said it could be weeks before
power is restored everywhere.

<TEXT>
   Beirut's airport opened for business
Sunday and a cargo ship sailed unscathed into a Christian port,
raising hopes that a truce was holding after six months of fighting
between Christians and Syrians.
   ``It's music to our ears,'' said resident Randa Masri after a
commercial freight plane circled overhead, one of three aircraft to
land Sunday at the newly re-opened Beirut International Airport.
   Beirut residents stopped in the streets and rushed to balconies,
craning their necks to look at the plane.
   A security committee made up of officials from the warring
factions and headed by Lakhdar al-Ibrahimi, an assistant
secretary-general of the Arab League, met for the second time
Sunday to discuss how to solidify the cease-fire and implement a
peace plan.
   The committee had met for the first time Saturday as some of the
most ferocious artillery battles in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
came to an end.
   Officials announced the lifting of seaport blockades, the
opening of the airport and the daytime opening of all crossings
between Christian east Beirut and Moslem west Beirut. Only one
crossing had been open sporadically during the latest outbreak of
fighting.
   By police count, 929 people have been killed and 2,741 wounded,
nearly all of them civilains, since the bombardments began March 8
between Gen. Michel Aoun's mostly Christian army units and Syrian
troops joined by allied Lebanese Moslem militias.
   The airport, port and crossing reopenings prompted Sunni Moslem
cleric Sheik Mohammed Rashid Kabbani to say they were ``the first
step on the road to resolving the Lebanese crisis.''
   Carrying a cargo of clothing, the Trans Mediterranean Airlines
freight plane was the first aircraft to land at the airport since
it was closed March 12. It was the longest shutdown for the
nation's only civil aviation facility since Lebanon's civil war
broke out in 1975.
   Later, a passenger plane belonging to Middle East Airlines,
Lebanon's national carrier, landed on a flight from the Saudi
Arabian port city of Jiddah with eight passengers aboard.
   They were greeted by several hundred airport and airline
employees.
   Another Middle East Airlines jetliner landed in the afternoon
carrying 57 passengers from Larnaca, Cyprus, said an official of
the airline in Larnaca.
   Ibrahimi arrived at the airport after the first two planes
landed and met briefly with the airport's general manager, Khaled
Saab. After the meeting, Ibrahimi told reporters he will ask other
Arab airlines to resume flights to Beirut.
   Police said a cargo ship cruised into Beirut port in Christian
east Beirut without being targeted by Syrian fire. They had no
information about the ship's flag or cargo.
   Two more ships were expected to dock soon, Beirut port
authorities said.
   A police spokesman said Syrian troops in west Beirut, the
eastern mountains and the north abstained from their daily ritual
of shelling the Christian coastline north of Beirut to maintain a
sea blockade of the Christian enclave.
   ``The front lines are quiet,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be
named under standing regulations.
   ``It seems that both parties are abiding by the security
committee's decisions,'' he added.
   Tens of thousands of refugees who had fled the carnage jammed
all entrances leading into the city and the Christian enclave for
the second straight day.
   All but an estimated 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million population
had fled the shelling to safer areas in Lebanon or abroad.
   Many of those flooding entrances on highways leading into west
Beirut were Moslem refugees returning from the Awali River, 25
miles south of the capital, where they had lived for months in
squalid makeshift encampments.
   Ibrahimi arrived in Beirut on Sept. 17, a day after a peace plan
was announced by an Arab League committee.
   The plan called for a truce and included steps to enforce it,
such as lifting seaside blockades, opening the airport and halting
weapons shipments from other countries.
   It also called for a meeting of the 99-seat Parliament on Sept.
30 outside the country to discuss political reforms to satisfy
Moslems demands for an equal share of power with Christians.
   Christians have dominated the government, legislature, army and
judiciary since independence from France in 1943, when they were
the majority.
   But Moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the
population of 4 million. There has been no official census since
1932.

   The headlines were of summits and arms
control, but it is a desperate Soviet economy that is melting a
range of bitter edges from the Cold War and driving a reduction in
superpower nuclear arsenals.
   The Soviets came to this Rocky Mountain setting in a
compromising mood and the United States, mindful of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's plight, was there to pocket the
concessions.
   One by one, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
trotted out the concessions _ yielding on Star Wars, a dubious
Siberian radar facility and on sea-launched cruise missiles.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was compelled to give
nearly nothing in return. Yes, he would consider a Soviet proposal
for inspection of U.S. radar facilities in Greenland and Britain.
And he would consider drawing up lists of acceptable Star Wars
space tests.
   But Baker, looking very much like the cat that swallowed the
canary, pointed out in his soft Texas drawl that really nothing
could be done about the radar without the consent of the host
countries, Denmark and Britain.
   And, he said, nothing really had changed since 1987 when the
Soviets first suggested identifying which tests were permissible
under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
   The Soviets, on the other hand, gave and gave again.
   They will let negotiators in Geneva try to complete a treaty to
slash the number of long-range nuclear weapons _ perhaps by half _
even without a parallel agreement on space-based defenses.
   That means the Soviets are surrendering to the U.S. Strategic
Defense initiative. Their best hope for trimming the program rests
with Congress, which has cut funds amid doubts an effective defense
can be mounted against ballistic missiles.
   On Krasnoyarsk, the Siberian radar station that the United
States says is illegal under the 1972 Ballistic Missile Treaty, the
Soviets completely gave up. The facility will be torn apart, as the
Reagan administration demanded.
   As for sea-launched cruise missiles, which Baker explained at a
news conference were essential to U.S. defenses, the Soviets again
gave way.
   Shevardnadze said they did not have to be part of the treaty
under negotiations in Geneva to cut bombers, missiles and
submarines by 30-to-50 percent.
   That means the United States may be able to retain its arsenal
or choose to enter negotiations with the Soviets to impose limits
on the weapons.
   Why was Shevardnadze so obliging?
   An unusual conversation between Shevardnadze and Baker on the
way here from Washington may explain why.
   The Soviet foreign minister frankly acknowledged the economic
and nationalities problems of his country were awesome.
   Baker heard more about the problems in the talks here. So did
Robert Zoellick, a close aide, who had a frank dinner here with
Soviet officials, including radical economists who have been urging
Gorbachev to move faster on perestroika.
   Cutting weapons expenditures may not transform the Soviet
economy. But it will help, and it is driving the superpowers into
arms control accords.
   ``We have moved from confrontation to dialogue and now to
cooperation,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>As Bush's Popularity Soars, Democrats Again Search for Their Own
Identity</HEAD>

   At a private meeting of House Democratic
leaders last week, national party chairman Ronald H. Brown rose to
apologize for recent speeches taking lawmakers to task for being
too cozy with President Bush.
   But some Democrats on Capitol Hill don't think the party chief
had anything to apologize for.
   As they head for a confrontation this week with Bush over the
capital gains tax rate _ a test that has split the party _ many are
concerned that Bush has lulled them into complacency and succeeded
in blurring the ideological lines between Democrats and Republicans.
   ``I've had a feeling for some years that on economic issues
we've in a sense become one party in America,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan. ``In a sense we've picked up the values of Ronald
Reagan.''
   Watching Bush sail along with extraordinarily high approval
ratings in the polls, Democrats also are looking bleakly ahead to
elections in which they seem unable to define themselves.
   Brown's chiding of congressional Democrats, ``in all candor, may
have provided a little catalyst for us to see where we're going,''
said Glickman.
   Speaking of Bush, North Dakota Democrat Rep. Byron Dorgan joked
morosely: ``We've got him where he wants us.''
   But as if to illustrate the problem the party faces in crafting
united positions, not all congressional Democrats agree with that
assessment.
   ``For any Democrat to imply that we've not made our positions
clear is just totally an astonishing statement,'' said Rep. William
Gray, D-Pa., the House majority whip. In a pointed comment aimed at
Brown, he added: ``I would urge fellow Democrats to pay a little
more attention.''
   The coming week will be a crucial, high-stakes test for the
Democratic leaders in Congress. It reminds some of 1981, the first
year of Reagan's presidency, when the GOP exploited divisions among
Democrats to roll over Capitol Hill on its tax and budget
priorities.
   This time, the test will come on Bush's plan to reduce the
capital gains tax rate. House Democrats propose instead to raise
the income tax rate on the wealthiest Americans, and use part of
the money to pay for an expansion of tax breaks on Individual
Retirement Accounts, portraying the choice as one of the middle
class versus the wealthy. But getting Democrats to line up behind
the alternative has proven to be a hard sell.
   ``There's a schizophrenia within the party,'' said Rep. Leon
Panetta, D-Calif. ``One group is trying to run away from the tax
issue, and ... the other is trying to urge the courage to confront
that issue. ... It's really '81 all over again. This is the crucial
week for the leadership.''
   Brown's worry is that Democrats, after losing five of the last
six presidential elections, are headed for failure again in 1992
unless they begin now to draw sharp philosophical lines between
themselves and Bush. That conclusion grows out of meetings with
local party officials across the country during his first seven
months as chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said DNC
spokesman Mike McCurry.
   ``The art of politics is presenting a choice to Americans about
two different views of the future,'' McCurry said.
   ``The Republicans know how to evoke passion, to push the hot
button in the voter's chest,'' Dorgan said. ``We've forgotten how
to do that.''
   But Brown's call for lawmakers to ``start preaching the
Democratic gospel'' annoyed top leaders in Congress, the party's
power base. As the majority on Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers
feel caught between the need to confront Bush and the necessity to
compromise to fulfill their responsibility for helping govern the
nation. And they believe the party can gain little by pursuing
confrontation for its own sake.
   ``A legislature by its nature speaks with many voices, so it's
difficult to have a single Democratic alternative,'' said Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., who said lawmakers have to worry about alienating
Republicans whose votes they need. ``The sharper the differences,
the more difficult it is to get 50 votes'' to pass a bill in the
Senate.
   Like Gray, many Democrats argue that the party already has laid
out a long list of issues where it is picking fights with the White
House. The list includes the war on drugs, where Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., has proposed to spend significantly more than Bush wanted;
boosting Bush's figure for aid to the new non-communist-dominated
government of Poland; and criticism of ``timid'' presidential
leadership in policy on arms control and Eastern Europe.
   Republicans, so far, purport not to be worried.
   ``You talk about the tax-and-spend Democrats,'' said House GOP
whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia. ``What's their answer on drugs?
Spend more money. What's their answer on Poland? Spend more money.
What's their answer on the tax fight? Raise taxes. ... It tells you
how far out of touch Congress has gotten with the American people.''
   While Brown may have a legitimate gripe with Congress, said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., it is impossible to begin setting the stage for a
campaign for the White House this early. ``You don't do that, and
get the public's attention, until you have a candidate and you're
running for election,'' he said. ``Most of the public is not tuned
in.''

<HEAD>Quebec Voters Again Ponder Sovereign Status</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Whether to spin off from the rest of the country
and form a new nation will once again be on the minds of many
voters Monday when Canada's only predominately French-speaking
province elects a new government.
   Premier Robert Bourassa is seeking another majority for his
Liberal Party, which smashed the nationalist Parti Quebecois four
years ago when it won 99 of the 122 seats in the provincial
assembly.
   Bourassa is touting a 4 percent annual economic growth rate, the
creation of 233,000 new jobs and the social stability that has
lasted most of his term.
   But the idea of separatism for Quebec, thought to have been put
to rest in a 1980 referendum in whichi 60 percent of the voters
rebuffed it, has proved surprisingly enduring.
   Jacques Parizeau of the Parti Quebecois has campaigned
vigorously on a platform based on eventual independence for the
province, and turned out consistently enthusiastic crowds.
   A range of public opinion polls show, however, little likelihood
that the nationalist party will end up with more than the 42
percent of the popular vote that would increase its presence in the
assembly or put a Liberal majority at risk.
   ``The conventional wisdom was that Quebecers were no longer
interested in independence,'' Parizeau said in an interview with
the national news weekly Maclean's. ``But when the question started
being asked again in public opinion polls, it suddenly dawned on
people that support for sovereignty has stayed at roughly 40
percent _ the same as it was in the 1980 referendum results.''
   The Parti Quebecois won 38.7 percent of the popular vote in the
December 1985 provincial election.
   Bourassa's support among Quebec's English-speaking minority,
which traditionally votes Liberal, may be hurt by his refusal in
December to allow more than a token change in provincial laws
restricting commercial signs to the French language.
   ``I came up with a pragmatic solution taking into account
cultural insecurity on the one side and the issue of individual
rights on the other,'' he told Maclean's just before the election.
``If there is a minimum of good faith on both sides, I still
believe there is an acceptable way of facing the challenges of the
1990s.''
   His compromise solution allowed bilingual signs only indoors as
long as the French-language portion was significantly larger than
the English.
   Quebec, Canada's largest and second-most populous province with
6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking.
   Supporters of language restrictions argue they are necessary to
protect French and Quebec's special culture surrounded by English
elsewhere in North America.
   A small Equality Party was formed to campaign against the
language restrictions and could win a seat in Montreal's affluent
Westmount district, a stronghold of English-speaking Quebec. Irate
English-speakers also could cut into the Liberals' showing simply
by staying home.
   Bourassa's term before the language uproar last winter was
unusually quiet as the province settled into a period of
prosperity, leading to speculation that the Parti Quebecois could
be facing its last days.
   In recent weeks, however, there have been environmental protests
over storage of cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs,
and a wave of labor unrest among some 265,000 public sector workers
including nurses, hospital workers and teachers.
   Bourassa was the youngest premier elected in Quebec when he won
the 1970 vote at the age of 36. The Parti Quebecois ousted him at
the height of separatist sentiment in 1976 and kept control of the
provincial government until the December 1985 debacle.
   Parizeau won a Parti Quebecois internal leadership struggle last
year and restored its hard-line platform that includes eventual
presentation of a constitution for an independent Quebec.
   Analysts note it is unlikely to attract any voters other than
the most ardent separatists.
   Bourassa, an economist, is counting on Quebecers being more
interested in pragmatic issues related to prosperity than to
independence.

<HEAD>Polish Cardinal Says New Prayer Center to Be Built</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic archbishop who had
opposed moving a convent from the Auschwitz death camp said Sunday
that a Vatican statement supporting the relocation probably means
that a new convent will be built.
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, who on Aug. 8 suspended
plans to build the new center for the Carmelite nuns, made the
announcement in a statement to the official PAP news agency.
   It was the first official reply by the Polish church to the
Vatican statement Tuesday that clearly backed moving the convent _
a decision that was resisted by Macharski and Polish primate
Cardinal Jozef Glemp.
   The Vatican also offered to help pay for construction of the
prayer center at an alternative site farther from the Nazi death
camp in southern Poland, where millions were killed during World
War II.
   On Saturday, leaders of the Roman Catholic Carmelite order in
Rome said they support moving the convent, as many Jewish groups
have demanded.
   Macharski said ``The Holy See's statement ... opens a road
toward resumption of work on the center of information, education,
meeting and prayer in Oswiecim,'' the Polish name of Auschwitz.
   Machaeski gave no indication when work on the new center might
actually begin, and made no direct mention of the nuns. Church
officials have obtained a site for the center about 3,000 feet from
the camp, but have not broken ground.
   Glemp, returning Friday from a trip to Britain where he met with
Jewish leaders, said there was ``significant progress'' toward a
positive settlement of the dispute. A day earlier, Jewish leaders
released a letter signed by Glemp in which he promised the convent
would be moved.
   The presence of the nuns and Christian symbols at the camp where
an estimated 2.5 million were killed simply for being Jews has
angered Jews worldwide and many Christians.
   However, many Poles have opposed moving the nuns, arguing that
their prayers are not harmful and they have the right to honor the
memory of the tens of thousands of Christians who also died in
Auschwitz. Four million people died at the death camp.
   Macharski in 1987 agreed to move the nuns to the new ecumenical
prayer center by February 1989, but the deadline passed.
   On Aug. 8, after a group of Jewish Americans entered the convent
grounds and were subsequently roughed up and dragged away by
workmen at the site, Macharski announced that plans for the new
center were suspended because of the ``aggressive'' atmosphere.
   The debate sharpened again Aug. 26 when Glemp accused Jews of
provoking anti-Semitism in Poland and speaking to Poles as a
``nation elevated over all others.'' The remarks were widely
interpereted as anti-Semitic.

   A man married nine women in
Thailand and then forced them to become prostitutes in Malaysia,
the national news agency Bernama reported Sunday.
   It quoted senior Moslem clergyman Abdul Mutalib Mohamed as
saying the man is to be charged in an Islamic court in his home
city of Kuantan, 125 miles east of Kuala Lumpur.
   Mutalib said Malaysia's Moslem religious authorities do not
recognize Moslem marriage certificates from Thailand.
   Some Malaysians register their marriages across the border in
Thailand because they cannot have more than three wives at a time
at home.
   There was no indication what penalty could be imposed on the
man, who was not identified.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A paperback edition of the controversial novel
``The Satanic Verses'' likely will go on sale this winter, The
Observer newspaper reported Sunday.
   More than 1 million hardback copies of Salman Rushdie's novel
have been sold since it was published a year ago this week. It is
in its ninth month on bestseller lists in Britain.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian spiritual leader who
died June 3, declared Feb. 14 that the novel blasphemes Islam and
called on Moslems to kill the Indian-born British writer and his
publishers.
   Since then, Rushdie, 42, has been living in hiding in British
intelligence safe houses.
   Nine stores have been bombed for stocking the book, seven in
Britain and two in California, in the past seven months. No one was
killed in the explosions police blame on hard-line Moslems.
   The weekly Observer, which publishes occasional book reviews by
Rushdie, said Viking Penguin told the author last week after months
of negotiations that a paperback edition will be published by a
specific date in 1990.
   It is expected sometime this winter, but the date is being kept
secret for security reasons, the newspaper said.
   Successful novels usually are printed in paperback after one
year, and The Observer said Rushdie has told friends that to delay
his would be submitting to intimidation and would endanger literary
freedom.

<HEAD>Vandals Wreck House Built For Nelson Mandela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mansion built for jailed
black leader Nelson Mandela by his wife, Winnie, has been ransacked
by thieves and vandals, newspapers reported Sunday.
   City Press, the country's largest-circulation newspaper for
blacks, said tiles, ceilings and floors had been ripped away and
plumbing fixtures had been removed. It estimated the cost of the
damage at $40,000.
   The house in Soweto has stood unoccupied since its completion
two years ago. Some black leaders suggested it would be
inappropriate for Mrs. Mandela to live in such luxury while most
residents of the huge township lived in tiny, overcrowded homes.
   Mrs. Mandela said she only intended to live in the house after
her husband was freed. But there have been reports that Mandela,
jailed since 1962, does not want to live in the house at all.
   The house has about 15 rooms and cost an estimated $200,000 to
build. It was paid for by a group of black businessmen.
   City Press said Mrs. Mandela has initiated legal action against
the police, blaming them for damaging doors and windows of the
house during a raid two years ago. The newspaper said Mrs. Mandela
believes the subsequent theft and vandalism was a result of the
initial damage.
   Mandela, 71, is serving a life prison term along with other
leaders of the African National Congress, the main guerrilla group
fighting South Africa's government, for plotting anti-government
sabotage. He is considered by many blacks as their paramount
leader, and his release has been widely demanded.

<HEAD>Tennessee Judge Likely to be Overturned on Appeal, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's ruling in a divorce custody battle
over frozen embryos is an aberration not likely to survive on
appeal, legal experts say.
   But at least for now, they say, the decision may have unforeseen
consequences for fetal research and the technology of fertilization
outside the mother's womb.
   Tennessee Judge W. Dale Young ruled Thursday that ``life begins
at conception'' in awarding temporary custody of seven frozen
embryos to a woman who is divorcing her husband.
   ``This is just a tragic case,'' said Professor Ellen Wright
Clayton of Vanderbilt University Law School, an authority on
reproductive rights. ``But, yes, I'll say it's an aberration. No
judge has said this before.''
   She added that the Supreme Court, while showing increasing
hostility to its 1973 ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, is not
likely to hold that life begins at conception.
   ``I certainly think (Young's ruling) goes too far even for this
Supreme Court,'' Clayton said. The justices ``have never said
embryos are children.''
   A deeply divided Supreme Court, ruling in July in a Missouri
case, expanded state power to regulate abortions but stopped short
of overturning its 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade.
   In the Tennessee case, Young awarded temporary custody of the
embryos to Mary Sue Davis, who wants them implanted in her so she
can bear a child. The judge ruled against her estranged husband,
Junior Lewis Davis, who opposed implanting the embryos.
   Davis said he will ask the Tennessee Court of Appeals to
overturn Young's ruling.
   Young relied heavily on testimony by a French geneticist who
said each embryo bears the full genetic blueprint of an individual.
The judge said the Davises ``have produced human beings ... to be
known as their child or children.''
   Abortion opponents welcomed Young's ruling.
   ``This ruling reflects what pro-lifers have been saying for
years,'' said Regina Smith, executive director of the Pro-Life
Council of Connecticut. ``Life begins at conception and should be
protected by the laws of our land.''
   But John Robertson, a professor at the University of Texas Law
School, said Young reached out ``in an unprecedented and
unwarranted manner'' to decide the dispute between the Davises on
right-to-life grounds.
   Clayton said the judge ``was completely bamboozled'' by the
geneticist's testimony. The embryos ``are unique genetically. But
that doesn't decide the issue,'' she said.
   Young could have reached the same result by deciding the case on
much narrower grounds, the experts say. For example, he could have
ruled for Mrs. Davis on grounds she had more to lose. She has said
this might be her last chance to bear a child.
   Young's ruling, hailed by abortion opponents and denounced by
abortion rights activists, could mean trouble for the decade-old
technology of in-vitro fertilization in which eggs are removed from
the mother's womb for fertilization and then reimplanted.
   In Mrs. Davis' case, nine eggs were surgically removed and
attempts to reimplant two of them failed. The remaining seven
fertilized eggs were placed in frozen storage.
   That is the typical procedure, since the odds are against
successful pregnancy for any one reimplanted embryo.
   Legal experts said the Tennessee ruling raises the question how
frozen embryos are to be disposed of when the woman does become
pregnant and the couple does not wish to have additional children.
   Young's ruling could discourage couples from trying in vitro
sterilization for fear they would be forced by law to preserve _
and implant _ all frozen embryos.
   Ironically, Clayton said, the only solution for couples that
have more embryos than they want could be to implant them and then
have an abortion if the woman becomes pregnant.
   Legal authorities also noted that Young's ruling raises problems
for researchers who use embryos for medical research.
   Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said, ``Must all frozen embryos now be guaranteed
implantation,'' or will in-vitro fertilization be outlawed?

<TEXT>
   Thousands of teachers, students and
their supporters demonstrated in eight cities across the country
Sunday to protest a ban on a teachers' union.
   About 1,500 students hurled rocks and bottles at riot police in
downtown Seoul after they were blocked from entering Yonsei
University. No injuries were reported immediately, but police
detained dozens of protesters in Seoul.
   ``Down with (President) Roh Tae-woo,'' the protesters shouted as
police firing tear gas chased them into alleys and side streets.
   About 1,000 teachers, students and workers held a separate
anti-government rally after staying overnight inside the campus,
which has been sealed off by thousands of riot police.
   Police also reported scattered rallies in seven other cities. In
the southern opposition stronghold of Kwangju, about 3,000 teachers
and supporters demonstrated on a university campus, news reports
said.
   Education authorities have outlawed the National Teachers Union
and ordered teachers punished for union activity, contending
leftists were using the union to spread revolutionary ideas among
students.
   Union leaders claim education in South Korea has been used by
dictators to cement their power and have called for educational
reforms.
   They say more than 1,500 teachers have been forced out of their
jobs since about 20,000 of South Korea's 300,000 primary and
secondary school teachers tried to organize a nationwide union
early this year.
   Thousands of teachers have defected from the union. But union
leaders claim about 8,000 still are with the movement, which has
been supported by dissidents, radical students and other labor
groups.

   Prime Minister Hun Sen on Sunday
said a full-scale civil war can be averted if other nations stop
arming the guerrillas once Vietnam withdraws its troops from
Cambodia.
   He said at a news conference that bloodshed is inevitable after
the Vietnamese forces backing his government are gone, but that the
level of fighting depends on foreign aid to the insurgents.
   Officials on both sides of the conflict have predicted new
offensives by the guerrillas after this week's withdrawal of
Vietnamese troops.
   Hun Sen also said that his troops still control Pailin, a
gem-mining region near the Thai border reported under intense
attack by the Khmer Rouge, the strongest group in the three-member
guerrilla coalition.
   Defense Minister Tea Banh acknowledged Saturday that the Khmer
Rouge now control some territory near Pailin.
   Vietnam, which invaded in 1978 to end a bloody reign of terror
by the Khmer Rouge and installed a pro-Hanoi government, has
pledged it will remove all its forces from the country by Tuesday.
The guerrillas say it is a ploy and that Vietnam is hiding soldiers
in Cambodia.
   A large farewell ceremony for the Vietnamese military,
reportedly the last of 26,000 in Cambodia, is to be held Monday in
Phnom Penh.
   ``After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops the war will
continue,'' Hun Sen told reporters. ``As to the scope of the war,
we think it will depend on foreign countries.''
   Thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in its
territory, while China has armed them.
   ``We appeal to those who supported the enemy on the basis of
their opposition to Vietnamese forces in Cambodia to reassess their
policies,'' said Hun Sen. ``The best way to prevent civil war is to
immediately stop supplying arms.''
   He said he is willing to improve ties between his Communist
government and the United States through joint searches for remains
of U.S. servicemen missing since the Vietnam War.
   Both Vietnam and Laos have participated in some searches for
missing U.S. servicemen together with American specialists.
   Hun Sen said his government already has discovered some remains
and is willing to hand them over. He did not say how many bodies
have been discovered, and a senior Foreign Ministry official said
he did not know the number.
   ``It was the U.S. that showed a lack of interest in our finds,''
said Hun Sen. ``They said they have no relations with the Phnom
Penh government so they will not get in touch with the Phnom Penh
government on this issue.''
   China and many Western countries refuse to establish diplomatic
ties with an administration installed by Hanoi, and the United
Nations recognizes the guerrilla coalition as Cambodia's official
government.
   However, a Foreign Ministry official said Sunday that Chinese
officials came to Cambodia for the first time since 1979 earlier
this year to discuss resuming trade ties.
   Hun Sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have agreed to
resume peace talks some time in the future.
   Peace talks in Paris failed in July after Hun Sen rejected
guerrilla demands that the Khmer Rouge be included in a
transitional government.
   Under Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge forced hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians to leave the cities and killed thousands in a brutal
attempt to create a primitive agrarian society.
   The Phnom Penh leader again refused to share power with them.
   ``We can make some concessions, but with regard to the Khmer
Rouge we cannot make any concessions at all,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, 11 Western aid agencies in Cambodia called on
governments Sunday to prevent the Khmer Rouge returning to power.
   ``Our experience in Cambodia and our contact with Cambodians at
all levels of society confirm that what Cambodians most fear is a
return to the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime,'' the groups said
in a statement.
   They criticized some countries for insisting that the Communist
Khmer Rouge be part of a future coalition government. Many Western
and non-Communist Southeast Asian countries who wish for Vietnam's
downfall back the coalition despite the inclusion of the Khmer
Rouge. The two non-Communist guerrilla groups do not hide their
distaste for the Khmer Rouge, but say they would rather share power
than fight them.

<HEAD>For Congress, Quick Completion of Spending Bills Seems Unlikely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress moved like a hare last year to finish
all 13 of its annual spending measures before the Oct. 1 start of
the new fiscal year, but this year the tortoise is winning again by
moving the finish line.
   Congress must whittle down the $600 billion worth of spending
measures before Sunday's start of fiscal 1990, but lawmakers will
also be occupied this week with other issues.
   The House weighs a tax bill in what will be a deeply partisan
debate, the Senate Finance Committee continues shaping a revision
of the Medicare catastrophic care program for the elderly, and the
House health and environment subcommittee continues crafting a
clean air bill.
   The spending measures, however, will be a top priority.
Congressional leaders have said repeatedly that one of their goals
for the year is to finish spending work on time.
   ``Slowly and with difficulty'' is how Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, described the progress on the spending
measures so far.
   That contrasts with the drama last Sept. 30 when at 11:59 p.m. a
middle-aged clerk who had just dashed the 500 feet from the House
chamber struggled to catch his breath and walked solemnly onto the
Senate floor.
   He delivered a copy of this year's foreign aid spending bill,
which the Senate had approved two minutes earlier. The chamber's
receipt of the measure formally completed its acceptance _ and
clinched the first time in a dozen years that Congress had adopted
all 13 of its annual spending measures on time.
   This year it looks like replacing that clerk with a relay team
of Carl Lewis, Ben Johnson and Mercury himself would do no good.
   So far, just one of the measures has been sent to President Bush
for his signature _ the one financing energy and water programs, a
perennial favorite of lawmakers because it is chock full of
projects for their home districts.
   Working on spending bills is not just a question of dollars.
   The measures contain issues as complex and wide-ranging as the
government itself, each of which pits interest groups and political
philosophies against each other. How should the ban on airline
smoking be extended? Should federal financing for ``obscene'' art
be terminated? Should government abortion restrictions be eased?
   Paramount is the fight between Democrats and Republicans over
how federal anti-drug efforts should be expanded. Both sides have
dug their heels in, believing that voters will reward the party
that delivers them from the problem of illegal drugs and the crime
they create.
   Some extra spending _ $1 billion or $2 billion or so _ is likely
to be devoted to drug initiatives this year, money that will have a
domino effect because it will have to be shifted there from other
programs.
   Republicans have blocked Senate passage of spending bills since
Sept. 14 while the two parties tried working out a compromise
anti-drug package. With talks at an apparent impasse, it is
uncertain whether the GOP will change its position.
   Other than the political embarrassment of failing to complete
its spending work on time, there will be no discernible
consequences should the work be undone as the clock strikes
midnight on Saturday.
   The law imposes no penalties for a missed deadline.
   Anticipating just such a scenario, the House plans on Tuesday to
pass a measure temporarily financing government agencies until
November.

<HEAD>International Monetary Fund Sees Healthy Slowdown in Rich Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and other rich industrial
countries will experience a healthy cooling of business growth this
year and next, the International Monetary Fund predicted Sunday.
   ``Projections point to a gradual moderation in the pace of
expansion during 1989 and 1990, following two years of rapid
growth,'' the fund said in its semiannual ``World Economic
Outlook.''
   For this year it sees the United States and 20 other
non-Communist industrial countries increasing their total output by
3.5 percent. That is 0.2 percent higher than its prediction of last
April. Though the fraction seems in percentage terms, the
difference amounts to tens of billions of dollars worth of
additional goods and services for the group.
   In 1990, growth is predicted to be 2.9 percent for the 21
countries.
   For the United States alone, the world's biggest economy, the
slowdown is seen as much greater: 4.4 percent last year, 2.9
percent this year and only 2.1 percent in 1990.
   The most growth is predicted for Japan: 4.9 percent this year
and 4.7 percent in 1990; for West Germany 4 percent and 3 percent;
for France 3.4 and 3; for Italy 3.2 and 2.9 and for Britain 3 and
2.7.
   ``There is no sign of recession _ we do not see it in the
current projections,'' Jacob Frenkel, the fund's research chief,
told reporters.
   He called the slowdown healthy and said he was especially
cheered by the growth of investment in new plants and equipment.
These create additional jobs and production for the future.
   But the report warned that there is still a danger of inflation
if the slowdown it foresees in demand for goods does not appear.
Frenkel urged governments to take care to prevent it.
   ``When you see inflation in the figures, you have lost the
battle,'' he said.
   Frenkel said he is also worried by the imbalances in world trade
_ the huge excess of imports over exports in the United states, and
the reverse situation in Japan and West Germany. The report said
Japan and West Germany should not try to expand right now, but
should be ready if necessary.
   The picture it gave for indebted Third World countries was much
gloomier.
   ``Seven years after the onset of the debt crisis, the prospects
for a sustained improvement in growth remained in doubt for many
developing countries _ in contrast to the more favorable outlook
for those developing countries that have avoided debt-servicing
difficulties and for the industrial nations,'' the report said.
   It calculated that production in countries having trouble with
their debt grew by only 2 percent last year. Since population in
those countries grows as fast or faster, that meant no meaningful
increase in average income and in many an actual decline.
   The report gave little attention to Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady's proposal for reducing the Third World's $1.3 trillion
debt, though it said the growing importance of debt reduction _
along with new lending _ should promote growth.
   ``It is important to realize that debt reduction is no panacea
and that strong adjustment measures remain the key to fundamental
improvements in economic performance,'' it said.
   Frenkel said debt reduction is justified only by improved
policies on the part of debtor governments. He emphasized the
importance of new lending. Major U.S. banks have recently been
increasing their reserves to cushion losses from Third World debt,
a move widely interpreted as indicating their unwillingness to make
new loans.
   ``There is no way you can forget new lending,'' Frenkel said.
``It must be part of future packages.''

<HEAD>Six States Offer Preview of Abortion Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro-choice forces appear to have seized the momentum in the
nation's renewed battle over abortion, but anti-abortion activists
say they expect the tide to turn as legislatures _ and the Supreme
Court _ return to session this fall and winter.
   So far, a half-dozen states have emerged as early legislative
battlegrounds, but most lawmakers appear reluctant to open the door
that was unlocked by the Supreme Court in July.
   ``I would say it's basically a standoff,'' said Lydia Neumann, a
spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which
favors access to abortion.
   In the nation's two governor's races this fall, pro-choice
candidates have used their viewpoint for its potential political
advantage, while anti-abortion candidates have sought to shift
attention away from the issue.
   In New Jersey, Republican James Courter moderated his strong
anti-abortion views and is widely perceived to have been hurt _
either by his views or by his waffling. Democrat James Florio
strengthened his pro-choice stance.
   In Virginia, Democrat Douglas Wilder is aggressively advertising
his pro-choice position in hopes of gaining ground on Republican
Marshall Coleman, an anti-abortion candidate who is considered the
front-runner.
   Burke Balch, state legislative coordinator for the National
Right to Life Committee, insisted that a strong anti-abortion
position was not a political liability. But in general, he conceded
that pro-choice forces have had the upper hand in the 2{ months
since the Supreme Court upheld Missouri abortion restrictions.
   ``We've seen a season in which our friends on the other side
have had the natural advantages with them,'' he said. ``Because
it's been a debate not about the specific legislation but about
abortion in general, and with the considerable funding they've had
to ... have their say in the media, they've had their innings.''
   He said the balance would shift this fall, when legislatures
begin to consider specific bills and when the Supreme Court begins
another round of abortion rulings.
   Pennsylvania and Michigan are the most likely states to enact
new abortion restrictions this fall, while prospects are less
certain in four other states where the issue is expected to come up
before the end of the year.
   Florida and Illinois are both expected to take up the abortion
issue at special sessions, and abortion bills are expected to be
introduced at a special session in Minnesota.
   But legislative leaders in Florida and Minnesota doubt that
they'll take votes on abortion during the special sessions, and an
abortion rights lobbyist in Illinois describes the issue there as
``up for grabs.''
   ``I may get a few more gray hairs on that one,'' said Illinois
state Sen. Judy Baar Topinka, a Republican who hasn't made up her
mind on the abortion proposals.
   The Wisconsin legislature is likely to approve changes in its
abortion law, but only to remove obsolete penalties that became
null after the Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973. More
restrictive abortion bills remain stalled in committees.
   Many more states will take up the abortion issue in January,
when most legislatures return for their 1990 sessions. An
Associated Press survey of the 50 legislatures suggests that
abortion will be a major issue in at least 23 states.
   Both sides agree that the most likely states to enact further
abortion restrictions next year are Missouri and Louisiana. Balch
said he considers the 13 states that offer publicly funded
abortions to be the least likely to enact restrictions.
   The coming abortion battles are likely to be fought along
several fronts. In many states, anti-abortion forces are preparing
legislation that mimics the Missouri law that was upheld by the
Supreme Court on July 3.
   That law banned abortions in public hospitals and stopped public
employees from counseling women about abortions. It also required
doctors performing abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks
old to determine if it could live outside the womb.
   Next year's anti-abortion drive also is likely to include bills
to ban abortions that are performed because the parents are
dissatisfied with the gender of the fetus, and those that are
performed in lieu of birth control.
   One of the most contentious issues will be laws that require
minors to inform their parents or get parental consent before
having abortions.
   About 30 states have parental consent laws, but most are tied up
in court and aren't in force. A slightly smaller number of states
have parental notification laws, almost all of which are in legal
limbo.
   Parental consent or notification bills are pending in Delaware,
Kansas, Massachusetts and Michigan.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on parental notification
laws in Minnesota and Ohio this fall. It also will review an
Illinois law that extensively regulates abortion clinics.
Anti-abortion activists hope the court will use the opportunity to
reassess Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that allowed states to
legalize abortion, but it's not clear whether it will.
   In the meantime, the most heat will probably be generated in
Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
   In Florida, Gov. Bob Martinez wants anti-abortion legislation
considered during a special session in mid-October despite
objections from legislative leaders.
   Anti-abortion forces are hoping to gain ground in Pennsylvania,
which already has relatively strict abortion restrictions.
Pro-choice forces launched a pre-emptive strike last week by
proposing bills aimed at increasing access to abortions.
   In Michigan, bills are pending this fall on a variety of
abortion restrictions, including measures similar to those upheld
in Missouri. Michigan's legislature is considered anti-abortion,
but Gov. James Blanchard is pro-choice and has vetoed abortion
restrictions in the past.
   Elsewhere, legislators will be watching the vanguard states and
waiting for the Supreme Court to act. And activists will be gearing
up for the fight.
   ``We're just beginning the battle,'' said Balch. ``There's no
question it's a new battle after Webster and both sides are
re-energized. ... I think it would be foolhardy for either side at
this point to make any predictions about how the battle is going to
come out in most states.''

<HEAD>Company Says Routes Would Be Slashed If Lifts Required On Every Bus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc. says thousands of rural
communities would lose their only source of public transportation
if Congress decides the Dallas-based transit company must equip
every bus with a wheelchair lift.
   Advocates for the handicapped, however, say Greyhound is
exaggerating the costs of compliance with the Americans with
Disabilities Act to shift attention away from the real issue _ that
the handicapped are largely denied access to public transportation.
   Under the Senate-approved legislation, Greyhound, the only
national intercity bus company, would have six years from enactment
before it would be required to make its buses accessible to the
handicapped, including those in wheelchairs.
   Greyhound interprets that as a mandate for a lift in every bus,
although the legislation is not that specific.
   Hearings are under way in the House on a version of the bill,
which could pass before the end of the year.
   Greyhound estimates the minimal annual costs of compliance at
$30 million to $40 million _ a ``bullet to the heart'' of a company
that lost $17 million last year and expects to make $5 million to
$10 million this year, says Fred G. Currey, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``At the present time, approximately 32 percent of Greyhound
lines are unprofitable,'' says Currey, who two years ago bought
Greyhound and Trailways Lines and has been in the process of
rebuilding the two badly deteriorated companies.
   ``Utilizing the lower $30 million figure, that would mean that
51 percent of our routes would be unprofitable, and that would
trigger a massive withdrawal from small cities and towns across the
country,'' Currey said in an interview last week.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company would have
to pull out of half of the 10,000 communities it serves, and all
but 500 of those towns have no other public transportation.
   Currey argues the lifts, coupled with bathrooms accessible to
the handicapped, would remove six revenue-producing seats from each
bus.
   The lifts also would take away valuable cargo space used for
shipping freight to thousands of rural communities, he said.
Freight shipments account for 10 percent of Greyhound's overall
revenues, but as much as 60 percent on some routes.
   Add to that the costs of buying lifts that have not been widely
used or tested, maintenance and insurance, and the total annual
expense per lift reaches at least $10,000 for a company with a
fleet of approximately 4,000 buses, Currey says.
   ``A bill designed to reduce discrimination itself discriminates
against our users, the poor,'' Currey says. ``This bill won't mean
mobility, it will mean lessened mobility for all Americans,
including Americans with disabilities, and including the rural poor
and the urban poor, and the young and the old.''
   But Ellen Daly, a legislative analyst with the President's
Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities, said that when
transit companies are asked to accommodate the disabled, ``there
has always been an inflation on costs.''
   She also believes the lifts would be used by many more people
than just those in wheelchairs _ the arthritic, cardiac patients,
the blind, parents carrying children in heavy braces.
   According to the President's Committee, 70 percent of all
Americans will at sometime in their lives be so disabled they
cannot climb a flight of stairs.
   A report by the Senate subcommittee on the handicapped said
intercity coach transportation is ``crucial for people with
disabilities, particularly those in rural areas.''
   Approximately 27 percent of disabled Americans live in rural
areas, compared with 23 percent of other Americans, the
subcommittee said.
   The report also noted that people with disabilities have
drastically lower incomes that other Americans, and the low-income
are more likely to use less-expensive intercity buses and trains
than airplanes.

<HEAD>St. Thomas Fears Storm Stigma Will Scare Tourists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unlike its
devastated sister island of St. Croix, St. Thomas escaped the worst
of Hurricane Hugo. But merchants still fear the storm still could
damage the tourism industry.
   Two main hotels of this U.S. territory, the V.I. and the Point
Pleasant, were destroyed and most of the 24 others were damaged.
But the Hoteliers Association said Friday they would be repaired in
time for the winter tourist season.
   ``The question is, will the travel trade send people down
here?'' said Jim Graves, co-owner of the 167-room Bluebeard's
Castle. ``People will think the V.I. got blown away by a hurricane
and won't want to come.''
   The roof of his hotel was partially blown away, windows were
shattered and rugs and furniture drenched. He estimated damage at
several million dollars.
   As on St. Croix to the south, all the trees on St. Thomas'
once-lush tropical hills were stripped of leaves and turned into a
brown wasteland. Officials said four to six people were killed in
St. Croix, but no deaths have been reported in St. Thomas.
   Some homes here lost roofs and windows. Yachts were blown out of
Charlotte Amalie Bay onto the wharf and shore, and power and water
services still were absent on most of the island Saturday.
   But most of the colorful, 19th-century Danish-style buildings in
downtown Charlotte Amalie escaped heavy damage, and streets were
clean.
   Three cruise ships visited the capital's harbor Friday, the
first since the storm. Normally, two or three visit daily.
   St. Thomas and St. Croix share about equally the Virgin Islands'
106,000 population. About 2,000 people live on the other main
island in the group, St. John, two-thirds of which is a national
park.
   Tourism is the main industry of the Virgin Islands, with 1.5
million visitors a year spending more than $500 million.
   At the V.I. Hotel, manager Jose R. Salas said that even though
hotels could be repaired by December, tourists might avoid the
Virgin Islands this season.
   But the 200-room hotel, on a hill overlooking Charlotte Amalie,
appeared a total loss. A dozen demolished cars and huge wooden and
concrete chunks of roof littered the parking lot. Most rooms, the
lobby and ballroom were gutted.
   ``This was a penthouse suite,'' Salas said, opening a door that
presented, instead of a room, a panoramic view of the city.
   He estimated damage at $10 million, and said he hoped the hotel
would reopen with 170 restored rooms in time for the winter season.
   Few stores were looted here, unlike on St. Croix. Gerald
Connolly, local coordinator of the Federal Emergency
Administration, said there was little looting because damage was
less severe.
   ``St. Thomas residents always knew they were able to go to the
store and get a cold beer,'' Connolly said.

<HEAD>Prince Philip Condemns IRA, Clergy Urge Forgiveness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEAL, Britain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the
``senseless'' killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA
bombing, and Britain's defense secretary said he warned all
military bases of the risk of similar attacks.
   Clergyman urged relatives and friends of dead and maimed
musicians to forgive the bombers. ``Only forgiveness breaks the tie
between the hater and the hated,'' the Rev. George Lings told
mourners.
   The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general of
the Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and toured
the severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal,
southeast Britain.
   ``It will not help the IRA win anything,'' said Philip, who wore
a Royal Marines tie. ``It is senseless. One simply wonders what
sort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts. It is
appalling.''
   He paid tribute to the 12 injured men, five of whom were
critically wounded.
   The prince was accompanied by Viscountess Mountbatten, daughter
of Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat in
1979. Mountbatten was India's last viceroy and a cousin of the
queen.
   British military installations are a frequent target of the
Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Defense Secretary Tom King said Sunday he has issued an alert to
all military installations to prevent other attacks. He would not
give details.
   ``The perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and there
is a risk of other attacks,'' King said. ``That is why we are
taking a number of other steps.''
   King defended the use of private security firms hired to guard
the Deal school and 29 other ``low-risk'' military installations in
Britain. Local residents and grieving relatives have said security
was lax and should be turned back to the marines. King said the
private firms will remain.
   ``It is important to remember that what we need in these cases
are eyes and ears and observation,'' King said on British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
   ``Private security guards can be a very useful additional
assistance. They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers
have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their
activity.''
   At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urged
mourners to pray for and forgive the bombers.
   The Rev. Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the
300-member congregation inside the barracks, ``if you can find room
in your hearts ... pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible
act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their
violent and evil ways.''
   Many cried as Howard read aloud the names of the 10 servicemen
killed during a coffee break between band practices. It was the
worst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982.
   At nearby St. George's Church, formerly the Royal Marines'
church, Lings said, ``no one says forgiveness is easy; no one says
the terrorist deserves forgiveness.
   ``But ... forgive them, they not what they do.''

<HEAD>Utah Teachers Vote For Statewide Walkout Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utah's public school teachers have voted
to hold a statewide walkout Monday to demonstrate to legislators
that pleas for more education funds cannot be ignored.
   Legislators fueled the revolt last week by passing a tax cut
instead of diverting money from a $94 million state surplus to
education.
   Teacher representatives from the state's 44 school districts
unanimously approved the action Saturday during an emergency
meeting called by the Utah Education Association following a
wildcat walkout in four of the state's largest districts a day
earlier.
   UEA President James Campbell criticized Gov. Norm Bangerter, who
outraged educators Friday by telling them to ``take a couple of
aspirin and go back to work.''
   ``The governor is wrong when he thinks aspirin can cure the
problems with education in this state,'' said Campbell, who passed
out aspirin bottles at the meeting. ``Aspirin will not cure
overcrowded classrooms. Aspirin will not cure lack of materials,
lower teacher-per-pupil ratios and lower salaries.''
   Teachers' pay in Utah ranks 43rd in the nation, $4,500 less than
the average national salary of $29,400, the association says.
   The revolt started Friday in the Davis School District when high
school teachers there walked out of class. By the end of the day,
the wildcat walkouts had affected four districts.
   Monday's planned one-day walkout will mean no classes in Utah's
800 public and vocational schools, providing a holiday for some
435,000 students and a day without pay for 20,000 teachers and
school employees.
   The teachers called on their counterparts at the state's nine
colleges and universities to join them and scheduled a rally Monday
in Salt Lake City. They also asked Utah residents to support them
Monday by driving with headlights on and urging Bangerter to veto
the tax cut.
   They pressed for a meeting of education leaders, legislators
from both major parties and a neutral mediator to set priorities
for education before January's general legislative session.
   James Moss, state superintendent of public instruction, appeared
resigned to more walkouts before the vote was taken but urged
teachers to consider alternative measures.
   Bangerter's chief of staff, Bud Scruggs, said teachers were
taking the tax cut too seriously and that last week's special
session was intended to get it ``out of the way'' so lawmakers
could concentrate on spending during the upcoming general session.
   ``We are sensitive to the teachers and we are proud of the
teachers. We understand their frustration. They have more of an
ally in Governor Bangerter than they're willing to realize,'' he
said.
   Campbell said he doubts lawmakers can ignore the uprising, but
he said teachers have been told before that education needs would
be met.
   ``Come January, if we don't get education resolved like we think
it should, it could get much bigger,'' he said.
   The teachers are seeking a 5 percent standard of living raise,
more money for textbooks and supplies and a commitment to education
as the state's top priority.
   Teachers last walked off the job in Utah in 1964 for essentially
the same reasons cited now. The action lasted two days and resulted
in more funds for library services, personnel and equipment, plus
general salary increases.

   Newly crowned Miss America Debbye
Turner made the first public appearance of her yearlong tour at a
new suburban mall where she was welcomed by characters from ``The
Wizard of Oz.''
   Turner, who represented Missouri when she won the crown Sept.
16, was escorted by the lion, tin man and scarecrow Saturday during
her visit to the Emerald Square Mall, which has an Oz theme.
   She turned down date requests and spoke of her desire to become
a veterinarian as she signed autographs.
   ``She's a gorgeous girl,'' said Barbara Dumont of Plainville.
``I knew she would win.''
   Turner make a point of playing down being the third black Miss
America, but some admirers volunteered that they found it
significant.
   ``I think the racism in this country is terrible and it's great
that white people have her to look up to,'' Dumont said. ``Look
what a mixed line this is. This is great.''

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor got veteran
football referee Pat Haggerty so rattled on Sunday that he let her
call the opening coin toss at the Washington-Dallas game before he
was corrected by the Redskins.
   ``Hey, wait a minute! We're supposed to call the toss; we're the
visitors!'' a Washington player shouted after Ms. Taylor, a guest
of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, called heads on Haggerty's toss.
   Embarrassed, Haggerty told Ms. Taylor, ``You've got me all shook
up.''
   He tossed the coin again and let the Redskins make the call,
which they correctly predicted as heads.
   The original game plan had been for Miss Taylor, in town on a
promotional tour for her perfume ``Passion,'' to flip the coin.

   Designer Paloma Picasso says well-known
photographs of her famous father, Pablo Picasso, playing with her
on the beach and swimming in the Mediterranean Sea were a bit
misleading.
   ``He would pretend to swim; he couldn't swim,'' she reveals in
the October issue of Fame magazine. ``I haven't told many people
that he was faking swimming.''
   When Ms. Picasso was born in 1949, Picasso was 67. Her mother,
artist Francoise Gilot, was 27.
   ``His mind was on his work but not all day long,'' the jewelry
designer recalled. ``The minute he turned it on to work, that was
it. But then he would be on the beach for hours and hours.''
   Gilot left Picasso in 1953 after living with him 10 years. Ms.
Picasso said she continued to spend holidays with her father, who
would take her to the circus in Paris.
   As for biographers' accounts of Picasso's mental abuse of his
mistresses, Ms. Picasso said: ``Everything is always negative. But
how could he be such a monster? Why would those women have stayed?
No one forced them.''

   Teen-agers who have not been too excited by
the wagon trains and cattle drives adults have been staging to
celebrate Montana's 100th year as a state may be more thrilled by a
visit from teen actor David Moscow.
   Moscow, the 14-year-old who played the young Josh Baskin in the
Tom Hanks movie ``Big,'' will be the feature attraction at an Oct.
7 dance, thanks to the efforts of 13-year-old Rachael Jamison.
   ``It's the centennial year, and there should be something for
kids,'' said the eighth-grader. ``So I thought I'd put it on.''
   Rachael, an aspiring actress who has seen ``Big'' ``about a
jillion times,'' traveled with her parents to Los Angeles in April
and met Moscow at a party.
   ``He was totally nice and everything,'' she said. ``We mostly
talked about his movies and stuff.''
   To help raise money for Moscow's plane tickets and party costs,
Rachael walked from business to business until 12 companies
provided $1,500. Then she called Moscow, who said he'd come and
show clips from ``Living Dolls,'' a fall TV series in which he
plays the son of a modeling agent.
   Rachael said Moscow, whose mother is from Great Falls, will
advise students how to avoid drug abuse and that proceeds from
ticket sales will go toward anti-drug programs in school.

   A Russian-language version of Minnesota
adventurer Paul Schurke's new book, ``Bering Bridge,'' is expected
to sell well in the Soviet Union.
   That assessment of Schurke's book about the Ely adventurer's
1,000-mile dogsled-and-kayak expedition from Siberia to Alaska last
winter came from Soviet publishing officials.
   They recently told Schurke's American publisher, Donald Tubesing
of Duluth, that ``Bering Bridge'' would sell at least 200,000
copies in its first Russian printing.
   ``In America, there are 55,000 books a year published, so
there's lots of competition,'' Tubesing said. ``Not so in the
Soviet Union. When the Soviets publish something, it usually sells
pretty well.
   ``But more than that, there is tremendous interest in the Bering
Bridge expedition there. They have issued a commemorative postage
stamp and have a bronze bust of Paul in Moscow,'' he said.
   The Minnesotan's expedition captured the imagination of the
Soviet people, Tubesing said. It led to an agreement between
America and the Soviet Union allowing Eskimos in the region to
travel freely between the two countries, reuniting families long
separated by political barriers.
   Tubesing, president of Pfeifer-Hamilton Publishers, said
arrangements are being made for a Russian translation of the book.
In America, the book is due out next month.
   ``There's a real excitement about it (in the Soviet Union),'' he
said. ``The Soviets are very well acquainted with Paul's partner in
the project, Dmitry Shparo, who has made 18 expeditions in 22 years
and has won the Medal of Lenin. The publishers expect it to do very
well.''
   Schurke and Shparo are to meet with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev in late October and present him with the flags used on
the expedition. They hope to do the same with President Bush.

<HEAD>East German Arrivals Near 20,000</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two weeks after Hungary opened its
western border to East German refugees, arrivals in West Germany
are nearing 20,000 with no apparent end in sight.
   The migration has exceeded West German expectations. Government
spokesman Hans Klein predicted earlier this month that up to 15,000
or 20,000 East Germans vacationing in Hungary were waiting for a
chance to flee their homeland.
   The Bonn government's earlier estimate that 100,000 East Germans
could emigrate or escape to West Germany this year was exceeded by
mid-September, and officials now say the exodus could reach as high
as 200,000 by year's end.
   West German border guards said that as of noon Sunday, 19,650
East Germans had fled through Hungary to West Germany since Sept.
10, and that the total would no doubt exceed 20,000 by Monday
morning.
   Another 900 East Germans were occupying Bonn's embassies in
Prague, Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw, Poland, demanding passage to
West Germany. And Austrian officials reported 819 East Germans
crossed over from Hungary overnight en route to West Germany,
another surge in the daily stream that shows no signs of ebbing.
   Sunday newspapers hinted that a solution to the embassy
occupations may be in the works, because East Germany wants the
refugee crisis cleared up by Oct. 7, when the hard-line Communist
state celebrates its 40th anniversary.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will visit East Berlin for
the festivities, and continued strife within the Warsaw Pact would
cast a shadow over the official events.
   While Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union have swept away the
vestiges of Stalinism, the East German state under the leadership
of ailing, 77-year-old Erich Honecker has refused to loosen the
Communist Party's grip on all aspects of life there.
   Gorbachev, who espouses non-interference in the affairs of other
nations, has been silent over East German intransigence on reform
and the refugee issue that has distanced Hungary from its East-bloc
allies.
   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper said a face-saving
plan had been worked out that would allow the East Germans holed up
in Warsaw to leave on special travel passes for undisclosed
locations, from which they could later leave for West Germany.
   The weekly news magazine Der Spiegel, in its edition released
Sunday, speculated that the East Germans would leave by ship from
the Polish port of Gdynia and travel to Stockholm, and from there
be flown to West Germany.
   Bild am Sonntag said East Berlin was insisting that such a
resolution be a ``one-time, humanitarian action.''
   The newspaper did not identify its sources, and Bonn government
officials declined to comment on the reported plan.
   ``The main difficulty is, according to diplomats, how it can be
guaranteed that Poland will not become a continually open door as
is the case with Hungary,'' the newspaper reported.
   An attorney acting on Honecker's behalf met two days ago with
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf
Seiters, to discuss the developments that have forced Bonn to shut
its embassies in Prague and Warsaw for now.
   More than 700 East Germans are packing the mission in Prague,
and another 200 are sheltered at the embassy in Warsaw, awaiting a
diplomatic solution to their demands to emigrate.
   Poland has shown reluctance to emulate Hungary's bold action in
letting the East Germans go west without permission of their
government. And Czechoslovakia has been even slower than East
Germany to loosen travel and emigration restrictions.
   The numbers occupying the embassies in Prague and Warsaw have
grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week, indicating, along
with the steady flow through Hungary, continued interest among East
Germans in joining the westward caravan.
   East Germans need no special permission to travel to
Czechoslovakia, and visits to Poland are also much easier to
arrange than trips to the West or permission to emigrate.
   The Hungarian newspaper Nepszabadsag reported Saturday that 951
East Germans have escaped across the Czechoslovak-Hungarian border
to travel on to Austria and West Germany.

<HEAD>Green River Investigators Need More Time As `Viable Suspect' Is Transferred</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``viable suspect'' in the Green River serial
murder case is due to get out of jail Monday, but authorities say
they need more time to investigate him and will try to keep him
incarcerated on federal charges in another part of the state.
   William Jay Stevens II, 38, is scheduled to leave King County
Jail after completing the remainder of a sentence for a 1979
burglary and for his 1981 escape from a work release center.
   But the Green River police task force will know where to find
the onetime law student, at least until later in the week. Stevens
is being transferred to Spokane County Jail in eastern Washington
to face federal charges of possessing a firearm while a fugitive in
the burglary case. Those charges carry a potential prison term of
up to 10 years.
   No charges have been filed against Stevens in the Green River
killings, the nation's worst known unsolved serial-murder case.
Stevens has denied he is the killer, and his family members have
produced documents that they say show he was on vacation with the
killings began.
   The case is named for the stream south of Seattle where the
first five victims were found. The killer is blamed for killing 40
young women, most of them linked to prostitution, from 1982 to 1984
in the Seattle and Portland, Ore., areas. Eight missing women also
are believed to be Green River victims.
   Stevens was identified as a ``viable suspect'' in an affidavit
used in July to obtain a search warrant of two Spokane residences
where he lived. It was during those searches that most of the
mounds of evidence that investigators are sifting through was found.
   ``We are not done; we're still working on it,'' King County
Capt. Robert Evans, the task force commander, said Thursday of the
probe that has kept 12 investigators busy since January.
   ``We need another 10 days or two weeks to get through what we
are evaluating. ... The decision would be to determine whether this
person is a murder suspect or merely a victim of some bizarre
circumstances.''
   After he gets to Spokane, Stevens could be released on bail on
the federal charges when a detention hearing is held, probably
later in the week, but prosecutors said they would fight that.
   ``We will vigorously argue that he be detained, given his past
history of jumping (bail) in King County,'' said U.S. Attorney John
Lamp in Spokane.
   Stevens, a fourth-year Gonzaga University law student, was
arrested in Spokane in January after a tip following a syndicated
television show about the Green River killings. When authorities
realized he was a longtime fugitive in the burglary case, they were
able to jail him even though they didn't have the evidence to
charge him in the Green River case.
   After the search warrants were issued in July, authorities
seized dozens of boxes of items, police uniforms and badges,
license plates, a complete undercover police car with municipal
license plates, and 1,800 videotapes, some of them pornographic,
from homes in Spokane where Stevens had lived.
   Investigators had theorized that the Green River killer, or
killers, used police equipment to gain the trust of victims.
   Authorities have been trying to determine Stevens' activities
after his 1981 escape to 1985, when he enrolled at Gonzaga Law
School and began living with his parents in Spokane.
   Evans said Stevens, under one of his many assumed names, even
bought a house in Portland during that time. And once, he said,
Stevens got authorities in Spokane to issue him a special license
plate by passing himself off as the police chief of a small town.
   ``Somebody has got to wonder what he's going to do with this,''
he said.
   Other jurisdictions also may charge Stevens, on crimes such as
car theft.
   Craig Beles, attorney for Stevens, said the attention given
Stevens makes him especially vulnerable for lesser charges.
   ``When you place someone's life under a microscope like that,
you are likely to find something,'' he said. ``There is some
concern ... that perhaps more minor charges are being used to hold
an individual until a larger investigation is completed.''
    As investigators continued examining evidence, Evans said he
continues to hope for that one detail that will put everything
together.
   ``The hard police work is being done and has been done,'' he
said. ``It's going to take a break.''
   ``It could be someone we've already looked at, and there is one
small piece of the puzzle missing,'' Evans said.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Promises Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Guerrilla leader Sam Nujoma, expected
to become Namibia's first black leader, told 70,000 jubilant
supporters on Sunday that he will build a democratic government
that encompasses all political views.
   Nujoma's speech was his first in Namibia since he went into
exile in 1959.
   The crowd also comprised one of the largest political meetings
in this territory where, under a U.N. independence plan, South
Africa gradually is relinquishing control after 74 years.
   The crowd, predominantly black with a handful of whites, packed
a sports stadium to hear Nujoma, president of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, who returned from exile on Sept. 14.
   Namibians, he said, have ``a historic opportunity for our people
to choose a government of the people, by the people, for the
people'' at independence elections in November.
   Nujoma called for reconciliation in this former Germany colony,
where his organization has fought a largely unsuccesful bush war
since 1966 to end South African rule.
   He promised that if his left-leaning movement gains control of a
post-independence government it will not exclude those with
differing views.
   ``SWAPO has no intention of imposing a one-party political
system on the Namibian people against their will,'' he said,
repeating a previously stated reversal of party policy. ``SWAPO
does not intend to rule Namibia alone, but will seek the
participation of others in formulating and implementing policy.''
   The speech took more than two hours to complete because it was
translated from English into Afrikaans and three local languages.
   ``Viva PLAN,'' shouted Nujoma, saluting the People's Liberation
Army of Namibia _ the guerrilla wing of his organization.
   South Africa agreed last year to implement a U.N. independence
plan as part of a regional accord that granted Pretoria's
longstanding demand for withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.
   Nujoma's party is favored to win most votes in U.N.-supervised
elections Nov. 7-11 that will choose participants in an assembly
assigned to draft a constitution. But it is uncertain whether it
will win the two-third majority needed to control the assembly
since at least 10 parties are contesting.
   About 700,000 of the territory's 1.3 million people have
registered to vote. Namibia's population includes 80,000 whites.
   Nujoma alleged the election campaign has been marred by
intimidation against his supporters, and cited the Sept. 12
unsolved assassination of Anton Lubowksi, the only ranking white
official in the movement.
   He reiterated his party's proposals to encourage foreign
investment and create a mixed economy.
   Regional stability in Southern Africa can come only when South
Africa dismantles apartheid, Nujoma said, but he commended recent
pledges by new South African President F.W. de Klerk to seek racial
reconciliation.
   Nujoma, 63, last addressed meetings in Namibia in 1959, when he
led a campaign protesting the forced removal of a black community
on the outskirts of Windhoek, the capital.
   His organization's image recently has been damaged by continuing
reports of atrocities by its guerrilla fighters against members of
the movement suspected of spying for South Africa. Many freed
detainees say they were tortured into making false confessions, and
they say hundreds of other detainees either remain in custody or
have been killed.
   Nujoma made no mention of the allegations in his speech.

<HEAD>New Solidarity TV Chief Promises Honest Airwaves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Solidarity journalist named to run the
state broadcast media after four decades of Communist control said
Sunday he wants to usher in ``honest, non-partisan and
professional'' programming.
   Andrzej Drawicz, 57, a former political prisoner specializing in
Soviet affairs, was appointed Saturday by Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki to chair the state Radio-Television Committee.
   In a telephone interview, Drawicz said he accepted the
appointment with ``a feeling of humbleness combined with
resignation,'' mainly out of respect and friendship for Mazowiecki,
another veteran journalist who is leading the East bloc's first
non-Communist government.
   The Communist Party strongly defended its monopoly over state
broadcasting as recently as this spring, but ceded it in principle
last month during talks on forming Mazowiecki's Solidarity-led
coalition government.
   Drawicz's committee oversees administration of broadcasting on
Poland's two national television channels and four radio channels.
There are no legal independent broadcasters in Poland, although
there are plans to permit private radio stations.
   The new media chief said his post ``does not lie in the main
sphere of my interests and I am not interested in making a
political career. ... But I came to the conclusion that when one
must, one must.''
   It is too soon to speak about concrete plans, he said.
   ``Generally speaking ... the television which has been an
instrument of one party's influence on society should be changed
into society's property, the property of the population, acting in
favor of this population,'' he said.
   It ``should be non-partisan, although it may present different
views through the statements of different people, a whole range of
views. That is its right and even its duty, to mirror society's
situation.
   ``But as such it should be honest, non-partisan and
professional.''
   Drawicz noted the poor financial situation of state television
and radio, which he said ``is as difficult as our general
situation'' of economic crisis.
   Some Solidarity activists have urged that, as a symbol of
Poland's dramatic political transformation, current news announcers
be replaced.
   ``Of course there are elements irritating society,'' Drawicz
said of possible personnel changes. ``We will have to think about
how to eliminate these elements without harming those who are not
guilty.''
   The radio-television committee is to be transferred from direct
Cabinet control to supervision by the Sejm, or lower house of
parliament, where the Solidarity-led coalition forms a majority.
Although chaired by Drawicz, it will include members of all
political parties, including the Communists.
   Unlike his predecessor, former government spokesman Jerzy Urban,
Drawicz does not to have Cabinet rank. This reflects Mazowiecki's
view that his new government should have nothing like a minister of
information shaping public opinion.
   Drawicz said he will begin his duties Monday.
   Drawicz, whose opposition activities date back to the Committee
for Defense of Workers in the mid-1970s, is a specialist in Soviet
affairs with no significant experience in television or radio.
   Along with thousands of Solidarity supporters, he was jailed
after martial law was imposed in December 1981 to crush the
independent trade union.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze waded into the Snake River fishing for Cutthroat Trout
on Sunday, but he'll have to tell his Kremlin buddies about the one
that got away.
   ``I have no fishing license, and I caught nothing,''
Shevardnadze joked as he and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
ended their early morning fishing expedition.
   ``I'm no pro,'' laughed Shevardnadze.
   Asked whether he had any luck, Baker, a veteran fly fisher,
replied, ``If you won't tell the president, I'll tell you.''
   President Bush went nearly the entire summer without catching
any bluefish in the Atlantic Ocean off his summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Baker, on the other hand, netted three trout in just a few
minutes. ``I threw them all back,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze and Baker, who held intense negotiations from
Thursday through Saturday in this Rocky Mountain resort, were out
fishing by 8 a.m.
   A school of eight otters swam around a bend in the river and
peered quizzically at the two diplomat-fishermen, standing about 30
yards apart in the water as they cast _ first with fly rods, then
with spinners. After several minutes, the otters turned and swam
under Cattleman's Bridge, from which about 40 reporters and
cameramen were recording the event.
   Before leaving the river, Shevardnadze was given two plaques and
a $300 graphite fly-fishing rod donated by local merchants.
   ``I'll need this in Moscow,'' laughed Shevardnadze.
   Fielding lighthearted questions from reporters at the end of the
expedition, the foreign ministers said they had cut a deal on
measuring fish.
   ``We reached an agreement on that yesterday,'' said
Shevardnadze, without disclosing details.
   Although the river had not been stocked with trout, the
expedition had been carefully prepared beforehand, said Park Ranger
Doyle Nelson.
   Shevardnadze was granted a complimentary fishing license. Ranger
Don Daughenbaugh, who had acted as fishing guide to three
presidents, tried out fishing holes and flies for the big event,
said Nelson.
   The rangers settled on a quiet spot in the river, where the
water ran slow and a little warm, 49 degrees.
   ``Trout are cold water fish,'' Nelson explained to reporters.
   The rangers took the bad luck of the Soviet foreign minister
philosophically.
   ``The worst day of fishing is better than the best day
working,'' said ranger Don Cushman.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs agents, used to seeing travelers use
exotic methods to smuggle drugs into this country, are noticing an
increase in the dangerous practice of swallowing cocaine to avoid
detection.
   Plainclothes inspectors roving the huge customs area at Miami
International Airport are capturing an average of a half-dozen of
what they called ``internals'' every week, said senior customs
inspector George Dickinson.
   The swallowers are taken to a hospital prison ward to pass the
sealed pellets of cocaine, with the help of laxatives.
   In one recent week, among those taken into custody were: a
45-year-old man who arrived on a flight from Bogota, Colombia,
after swallowing 120 packets totaling a kilo of cocaine, or about
2.2 pounds; two men on another flight from Bogota who ingested 226
drug packets between them; and two men who flew in from Jamaica
with a total of 100 packets of cocaine and hashish in their systems.
   So far this year, 64 people ``packed from top to bottom with
pellets'' have been taken into custody compared with 25 for all of
last year, Dickinson said. The majority of drug seizures by agents
at the airport in the past three months have been from internals,
he said.
   ``It's becoming more prevalent due to extensive outbound
searches in Colombia,'' he said.
   Colombian authorities stepped up their pat-downs of U.S.-bound
travelers about six to eight months ago, Dickinson said, prompting
many would-be smugglers to stop carrying drugs on their person.
   Most of the defendants accused of smuggling drugs internally are
poor, illiterate Colombian citizens who can expect to earn about
$2,000 for successfully delivering the drugs for someone else, said
Dickinson.
   ``Money is the motivation,'' said John Fernandes, spokesman for
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Miami authorities recovered 116 pellets from a Colombian woman
who was seven months pregnant when she swallowed nearly a kilo of
cocaine to bring into the United States. In July, Iveth Rocha, 23,
was sentenced to 40 years in prison after being convicted of drug
trafficking.
   Officials aren't certain how much cocaine is getting in via
swallowers. But customs agents believe they have developed a keen
eye for spotting potential smugglers by looking for signs of
unusual behavior or nervousness.
   Once people are targeted, they are taken aside for an in-depth
interview and a decision is made whether to transport them to
Jackson Memorial Hospital to recover the drugs if they don't
produce them at the airport.
   ``When we started to see this 10 years ago, the packets were
hand-made things that tended to dissolve or break apart,'' said Dr.
Kathleen Schrank, director of Jackson's emergency care center.
``Things have gotten a whole lot more sophisticated.''
   The cocaine is usually compressed into a hard cylinder, sealed
in plastic and wrapped in condoms or the tips of surgical gloves.
The reinforced packets have cut down on the number of deaths that
resulted from very pure cocaine escaping into the gastrointestinal
tract.
   ``Uncut cocaine in that potency, when it escapes into the
system, is lethal,'' said U.S. Customs spokesman Cliff Stallings.
   Those who wait for symptoms to develop before they seek medical
attention may be too late, said Charles Wetli, Dade County's deputy
chief medical examiner.
   Alfredo Romero, 44, was visiting his brother in Hialeah last
month when he started complaining of an upset stomach and began
vomiting the day after arriving from Colombia. The next day he was
found unconscious on the living room floor and was pronounced dead
a short while later.
   An autopsy revealed nearly half a kilo of cocaine in his system;
several packets of cocaine had ruptured.

<HEAD>Bush Faces Changed United Nations in First Presidential Address</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush addresses the General
Assembly on Monday, he will stand before an institution that has
changed dramatically since his days as the U.S. representative to
the United Nations.
   Gone are ritual denunciations of the West by Soviet and Third
World speakers. Harmony and cooperation are now the watchwords in
the General Assembly, and most resolutions are adopted by consensus.
   The Soviet Union has emerged as the mover and shaker in
international diplomacy, standing in marked contrast to the Bush
administration's cautious, reactive approach to world affairs.
   Bush aides said Sunday that his first presidential address to
the United Nations will include a major chemical weapons proposal
and a call for international cooperation on drugs, terrorism and
the environment.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the proposal would
``move the world closer to a ban on chemical weapons.''
   But White House officials were tight-lipped on the substance of
the proposal.
   The president also is expected to discuss the moves toward
political and economic reform in Poland and other East bloc
countries.
   Bush's speechwriters completed a draft of his U.N. address
Saturday night following announcement of several accords, and plans
for a superpower summit, after two days of talks between Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Among the accords was an agreement to exchange data on chemical
weapons by the end of the year and allow visits by inspectors of
the other side to stockpiles and plants by June 30. In a second
phase, there would be more intensive on-site inspections of the
submitted data.
   Officials at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations say
privately that they were not consulted about the speech, except to
scour their archives for anecdotal material from Bush's tenure as
the U.S. ambassador in 1971-72.
   That suggests Bush will not respond to the multitude of Soviet
proposals for strengthening the United Nations, many offered by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his speech to the Assembly in
December.
   Gorbachev called for a U.N. peacekeeping force in Afghanistan,
U.N. leadership in banning weapons from space, and in assembling
scientists to solve environmental disasters.
   He also proposed giving the World Court mandatory jurisdiction
in all human rights cases and called for a U.N.-sponsored
conference on solving the Third World's $1.3-trillion debt to the
developed world.
   All these ideas have withered on the vine as the United States
withheld any reaction or counterproposal and the Soviets
characteristically failed to lobby aggressively for them.
   Western diplomats say privately that they expect Bush will
praise the new era of cooperation among the major powers, brought
about by Gorbachev's commitment to restructuring Soviet society and
cooperating with the West whenever possible.
   Bush is also expected to assail the power of the drug lords,
whose power rivals that of the governments of some nations where
they are based.
   U.N. peacekeepers from the past and present won the Nobel Peace
Prize last year for their work. The United States advocates a
strong U.N. role in peacekeeping and Bush is expected to remind the
delegates of that.
   U.N. officials and even U.S. allies in Western Europe note that
Washington still has tight purse strings when the United Nations is
concerned.
   ``The entire international community is encouraging us and
applauding what we are doing,'' Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said this week. ``It is easy to applaud; but I would like
them to do what is really their duty _pay their contributions to
our peacekeeping operations.''
   As of the end of last month the United States was over $495
million in arrears on its dues to the regular U.N. budget. That is
about two-thirds of the $688 million in total arrears owed by all
159 member nations. The entire regular U.N. budget is about $776
million a year.
   The United States also owes about $254 million to special
accounts for peacekeeping, which costs the world body about $700
million yearly.
   The Soviet Union is about $7 million in arrears to the regular
budget and owes $211 million for peacekeeping but has been paying
off the peacekeeping debt.
   Bush's administration has asked Congress to pay the arrears, but
due to the federal budget deficit, the United Nations appears
unlikely to receive more than the current year's dues plus current
peacekeeping costs.

   Congress will review the Navy's investigation
into the explosion aboard the USS Iowa in light of reports of
improper experiments with the ship's guns, Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell said Sunday.
   Mitchell, appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' commented when whether he thought there was a cover up
by the Navy, which concluded Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig ``most
probably'' sabotaged a 16-inch gun he was loading.
   ``I'm unable to make that judgment, but based upon the reports
we've seen, there will undoubtedly be a congressional inquiry into
the matter to attempt to determine, if possible, what did happen
and how well done the investigation and report were,'' Mitchell
said.
   Hartwig and 46 mates in the ship's second turret died in the
April 19 explosion, which occurred during firing practice.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has begun sifting through
Navy documents on the investigation, said committee staff director
Arnold Punaro. He said the committee will conduct hearings on the
Navy's conduct of the investigation.
   How soon those hearings will be held is unknown, since the
committee is currently involved in working out a defense bill with
the House.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, also appearing on the ABC
program, reiterated his defense of the Navy report and said
investigators knew unauthorized experiments were being conducted
with the guns.
   ``I was fully briefed on the investigation before it was made
public,'' he said. ``The Navy was aware of those tests. The fact
that they were experimenting was revealed by the man who did the
investigation on the Iowa, but there's no evidence that there's any
link between the experiment and the explosion.''
   Media General Newspapers had reported a week earlier that the
Iowa was used as a ``floating laboratory'' for high explosive
experiments, including the combination of a reduced powder charge
with the heaviest projectile.
   The Navy said it is conducting an investigation into the
unauthorized experiments.

<HEAD>Five Compete to Succeed Mayor Voinovich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS J. SHEERAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five officeholders well-known in Cleveland are
campaigning aggressively to succeed Mayor George Voinovich, who led
the city out of financial default and fought off years of jokes
about its burning river.
   The five will meet in a non-partisan Oct. 3 primary, with the
top two vote-getters meeting in the Nov. 7 general election.
   Voinovich took office Nov. 12, 1979, one year after the city
defaulted under Mayor Dennis Kucinich, a self-styled populist. At
the time, the city's image was in shambles, the result of default
under the youthful Kucinich, who was dubbed ``Dennis the Menace.''
   And then there was the 1969 fire on the oil-slickened Cuyahoga
River, which created the image of a dirty city, the butt of jokes.
   Last year, Voinovich tried unsuccessfully to unseat U.S. Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, a Cleveland Democrat. He's not running for mayor
again in order to seek the 1990 Republican nomination for governor.
   In the race for his successor, Voinovich endorsed the lone GOP
candidate, Ralph J. Perk Jr., the school board president and son of
a former mayor.
   The other candidates, all Democrats, are Court Clerk Benny
Bonanno, City Council President George Forbes, Cuyahoga County
Commissioner Tim Hagan and state Sen. Michael White.
   Forbes, 59, has served on the City Council since 1963 and has
been its president for 16 years, a role that made him a likely
favorite to make the runoff. Voinovich gave Forbes broad powers to
promote bipartisanship in the city government.
   White, 37, who has served in the state Legislature for six
years, won an endorsement Sunday from The Plain Dealer, Cleveland's
only daily newspaper.
   The five candidates have focused on the issues of jobs,
education and drugs and how to continue the downtown development
that has polished the image of the city of about 536,000 people.
Drug tests for candidates, charges of ethical conflicts and talk of
voting along racial lines also have been prominent.
   Political science professor B. James Kweder of Cleveland State
University expects one white and one black to emerge from the
primary. White and Forbes are black; the others are white.
   ``Blacks vote for blacks, whites vote for whites. They cross
party lines to do that,'' he said.
   The Census Bureau estimates that 49 percent of the population is
black, 45 percent white and 6 percent Hispanic and other minorities.
   Forbes acknowledged that he had little support in the largely
white west side and said race was the reason no white elected
official had endorsed him or White.
   White dismissed Forbes' complaint of racial prejudice, saying
Forbes was hoping to capitalize on racial divisions. White said
endorsements typically follow neighborhood political
considerations, and he noted that no black elected official had
endorsed a white candidate.
   Forbes ran a major voter registration drive, and 70 percent of
the city's 24,000 new voters live in mostly black neighborhoods.
   Robert E. Hughes, chairman of the Cuyahoga County Board of
Elections and the county Republican Party, predicted the turnout in
a black-white runoff could surpass the record 79 percent in 1967,
when Carl B. Stokes became the first black mayor of a major U.S.
city.
   ``You have five people with enormous name recognition, and they
are waging an all-out campaign,'' Hughes said.
   The increasing cocaine problem has made drugs a focus of the
campaign, with Hagan and Bonanno accepting Perk's challenge to take
urine tests. All three said they proved themselves drug-free.
   Forbes has been criticized for his support of five narcotics
detectives acquitted of drug trafficking charges during a 1985
sting operation, in which police recruited a dealer as an informant.
   The informant said police allowed him to continue selling drugs
in an impoverished black neighborhood, a claim denied by police
officials. But blacks were angered.
   Forbes also came under attack when his law firm represented a
tenant group before a public housing agency whose governing board
includes Forbes appointees. Federal officials have called
Cleveland's public housing the most delabidated in the country,
except for Chicago's.
   Forbes began his campaign by apologizing for mistakes, which
included comments considered by some as sexist and tossing a chair
at a City Council colleague.
   He also apologized for a campaign comment that he didn't
``pimp'' his wife like Hagan, who is married to a wealthy woman.
   Hagan, 43, is a self-described liberal and longtime friend of
the Kennedy family.
   Bonanno, 39, who has held five different elective offices; Perk,
44, who is a lawyer in addition to being school board president;
and White all have served on the City Council with Forbes.

<HEAD>Hugo-Damaged Storage Tank Spilling Fuel Oil Into St. Croix Harbor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A utility storage tank damaged by
Hurricane Hugo is spilling 7,000 gallons of fuel oil a day into a
harbor in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Coast Guard said Sunday.
   The Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office in San Juan said 40,000
gallons of oil have flowed into waters around Christiansted,
capital of St. Croix, since Hugo slammed into the U.S. territory on
Sept. 17.
   The oil is flowing from a storage tank at a Virgin Islands Water
and Power Authority plant containing 1.6 million gallons of No. 6
fuel oil, the Coast Guard said in a statement.
   It said the oil is leaking into earthen containment dikes and
trenches, and then into Christiansted Harbor. Some oil is being
contained within floating booms, and some is free-floating.
Northerly winds have kept the oil from spreading more than about a
quarter-mile from shore.
   ``Because the rate of discharge from the damaged tank has been
steady, the Coast Guard doesn't expect a catastrophic spill from
the tank,'' the statement said. ``However, the containment dikes
and trenches could break at any time.''
   Coast Guard pollution specialists from Mobile, Ala., were
preparing on Sunday to pump oil from the dikes to barges for
removal, so that the leak can be repaired.
   ``The Coast Guard hopes that all the oil can be removed within
the next two days,'' the statement said.
   St. Croix was one of the eastern Caribbean islands hardest-hit
by Hugo along a 500-mile arc from Guadeloupe to Puerto Rico.
   Officials say the storm caused at least 27 deaths and billions
of dollars in damage in the region.
   Much of Puerto Rico, including the San Juan metropolitan area,
remained without running water Sunday. About one-quarter of the
island also was without electricity.
   Otherwise, however, the island was returning to normal, with
nearly all roads cleared and most stores and gas stations open.
   Education Secretary Jose Lema said public schools would reopen
Monday, but he cautioned students not to drinking water from
fountains because of the risk of contamination.

<TEXT>
   A collector shelled out $19,800 to
add a 178-year-old bottle of Chateau Yquem to his collection during
Christie's first West Coast wine auction.
   The daylong event Saturday grossed $654,115, said Shirley
Knudsen, a spokeswoman for the London-based auction house.
   ``The sale has exceeded Christie's expectations,'' Ms. Knudsen
said. ``It shows that the enthusiasm for rare wines is strong in
Southern California.'' As a result, she said, Christie's is
planning a second West Coast wine auction next spring.
   More than 30 private cellars were represented at the auction,
which drew more than 400 bidders.
   A collector from Marina del Rey offered the highest bid of the
day, topping $11,800 paid by a Canadian for an Imperial of 1924
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and $11,200 by a Sacramento resident for
a rare magnum of Chateau Lafite 1864.
   The three top overall bidders were Southern Californians,
spending $48,000, $46,000 and $31,000, respectively. Ms. Knudsen
would not name the bidders, saying the auction house protects
buyers' privacy.

<TEXT>
   His greetings, without exception, are polite
and eloquent, instructive of his Old World upbringing. But the
courtliness quickly gives way to sarcasm if Tom Lantos is
displeased by what he hears.
   ``This is about as believable as Elvis being seen in a K Mart,''
the California Democrat retorted recently to one witness testifying
before his subcommittee.
   ``If HUD were a bank it would be closed by the FDIC,'' was
another memorable Lantos committee-room response.
   Such quips have become a Lantos trademark as he leads a
congressional investigation of Reagan-era scandals at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The review has
transformed the him from a 61-year-old congressman who was little
known outside his California district into one of the most visible
lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
   Lantos quickly seized on an April report that first disclosed
some of HUD's problems, and his success appears to have given
lawmakers who didn't act so fast second thoughts.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle, D-Mich., began
a HUD hearing last week with an excuse for not being more active on
the issue, saying the panel had ``put other things aside'' to deal
with the savings and loan bailout.
   ``That job is now done,'' Riegle said in announcing he planned
an exhaustive investigation of his own, with testimony from a long
list of witnesses who already have been summoned by Lantos.
   Lantos' hearing room has been the scene of testimony detailing
the millions made by Republican consultants with access to HUD
officials and the millions lost by HUD because of fraud and
mismanagement. The obscure panel and its chairman have shown no
fear of controversy, issuing a subpoena to force former HUD
Secretary Samuel Pierce to testify this week.
   Critics say Lantos has played politics at the expense of the
rights of some of the subcommittee witnesses.
   ``This is a lawmaker on national television doing things for the
explicit reason of getting votes,'' said Raymond Banoun, who
represents a former top Pierce aide who refused to testify. ``It's
more putting on a show than an investigation.''
   Lantos scoffs at that, saying he has run a ``fair and
professional and bipartisan investigation,'' and a leading
Democratic theorist said criticism of his performance will fall on
deaf ears among the public.
   ``The public is not worrying about the fine legal arguments,''
said political consultant Frank Greer. ``They think this guy should
be going after them for stealing the taxpayers' dollars and putting
them in the pockets of Republican consultants. He has enhanced his
image and the image of the Democratic Party as well.''
   Lantos is clearly relishing the spotlight and boasts that his
subcommittee's work was the impetus for an Office of Management and
Budget directive that all agencies review their management
practices.
   ``What is happening is analogous to you suddenly seeing a
highway patrolman in your rear view mirror and you suddenly start
driving at the proper speed,'' Lantos said. ``My job will be to try
to see to it that this atmosphere is not just a fleeting moment.''
   Lantos professes no interest in parlaying his sudden prominence
into political gain. But colleagues and political analysts say that
at a minimum Lantos has established himself as an effective and
articulate Democratic advocate for clean government.
   ``That's not for me to evaluate,'' was all Lantos would say when
asked whether he had profited politically from the investigation.
   He doesn't need help back home, where he captured more than 70
percent of the vote in his last two re-elections, but Lantos could
benefit in the House when he needs support for legislation.
   ``The way he's conducted the hearings has created a well of
goodwill for him,'' said Greer.
   That Lantos has spent most of his congressional career focusing
on foreign affairs is a product of his childhood. He was born in
Budapest in 1928 and escaped during the World War II Nazi
occupation of Hungary. He was first elected to Congress in 1980 and
is a co-founder of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus.
   But when HUD's inspector general issued a report in April saying
that an agency rent subsidy program appeared riddled with influence
peddling, Lantos jumped on the issue and launched an investigation
that now seems likely to continue into next year.
   He is a former college professor and holds a Ph.D. in economics,
yet at time he has professed to being ``simple'' in asking for more
details. The tactic that has nudged several witnesses into
compelling testimony, including former Interior Secretary James
Watt's admission that he made more than $400,000 in HUD consulting
fees despite no housing background and a Maryland woman's
incredible account of how she kept $5 million in HUD money without
being caught.
   Lantos also has brought theater to the televised hearings, twice
calling witnesses to testify even though he had been told in
advance they would not appear, then looking out in mock disbelief
at the empty witness table.
   Those moments have been followed by tirades directed at the
absent witnesses, including Pierce. Pierce had said he needed more
time to prepare because he had trouble finding a lawyer.
   That was instant fodder for another verbal salvo from Lantos.
   He called Pierce ``capricious'' and ``deceitful'' and
sarcastically dissected the former Cabinet member's excuse.
   ``I can understand not being able to find affordable housing in
Washington,'' said Lantos, ``but not an attorney.''

   Southern California is in the middle of a
drought and it's a crime to waste water. But who checks up on
violations by the city itself?
   Edwin E. Neumann does, as he surveys his neighborhood almost
daily looking to bust water wasters.
   ``The city asks everyone else to conserve water. Yet it doesn't
follow its own advice,'' he said. ``There's no excuse for things
like this.''
   Neumann has identified dozens of leaky fire hydrants and broken
sprinklers on public greenbelts since launching his one-man patrol.
   He has filed repeated complaints with the city about
street-sweeper drivers who don't close hydrants after filling their
tanks and park workers who carelessly water the sidewalks as well
as their lawns.
   Neumann, 69, a retired high school gardener, started his
campaign after receiving city literature promoting water
conservation.
   His first target was a fire hydrant across the street from the
high school that had been dripping for years.
   Althoug he's a pain to some, other city officials admire
Neumann's tenacity.
   ``I would say he's a value to the city and I'd like to have more
people like him, even if other departments wouldn't,'' said Shirley
Minser, a field deputy for City Councilman Richard Alatorre.

   Several hundred people turned out during the
weekend for ``Victoria Day,'' honoring the first woman to run for
president, nearly 50 years before U.S. women won the right to vote.
   Victoria Claflin Woodhull, born Sept. 23, 1838, also reportedly
was the first woman stockbroker on Wall Street and the first woman
to speak before Congress, said organizers of Saturday's event.
   ``Most people do not even know who she is, but she was an
example of courage and leadership,'' said Joseph Berg, president of
the Homer Historical Society.
   Several hundred people gathered at the local library to trade
stories about Ms. Woodhull and buy and sell T-shirts, caps, plates,
bells, postcards and other souvenirs.
   Ms. Woodhull was the candidate of the Equal Rights Party in
1872, receiving only a few thousand votes. One of her election
opponents was then-President Ulysses S. Grant, who was re-elected.
   ``Victoria was a person who believed that blacks and women were
people, just like the Constitution said they were,'' Berg said.

   Thirty heavily armed drug
traffickers entered an impoverished slum on Rio's outskirts and
massacred 11 men from a rival gang, a police detective said Sunday.
   The detective said the traffickers carried machine guns and
revolvers when they invaded three adjoining hillside shantytowns in
the Penha neighborhood early Saturday morning.
   They first kidnapped a rival gang member who led them to the
houses of 10 others involved in the area's drug trade, said the
detective, who would only give his first names, Luis Carlos.
   He said the men were dragged from their homes, beaten and then
executed. ``Some of the victims were riddled with more than 20
bullets,'' Luis Carlos said.
   He said the assassins, who came from the nearby slum of Acari,
killed the men in an effort to take control of Penha's cocaine and
marijuana trafficking.
   Brazil traditionally has played a relatively minor role in the
South American drug trade, which is dominated by Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia.

   Relief organizations are rushing to help thousands
of Soviet Jewish emigrants reach the United States by Sept. 30, the
last day for regulations that allow them to enter relatively easily.
   Immigrant aid organizations are working overtime to prepare
refugee applications for examination at the U.S. Embassy in Rome,
one of the main transfer points for Soviet Jewish refugees.
   Sept. 30 marks the end of the U.S. government's fiscal year and
authorities are studying new limits on Soviet immigration for the
next fiscal year.
   In recent weeks, more than 400 Soviet refugees have filled New
York-bound planes each morning at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport,
up from an average of 130 daily in May, according to the U.N.
International Committee for Migration.
   On Thursday, 1,350 Soviet Jewish refugees are to leave Rome for
New York _ 480 on a single plane.
   ``It's total chaos,'' said an employee of the U.N. organization
last Thursday, as she urged refugees to bring their luggage to the
check-in counter.
   Most Soviet Jews leave their country on an Israeli visa. But
once they get to Rome or Vienna, many apply for U.S. visas.
   Until October 1988, all Soviet Jews were granted U.S. refugee
status on the grounds they were the object of persecution at home.
The U.S. government pressed Moscow to allow greater Jewish
emigration.
   As U.S.-Soviet relations improved and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev put more liberal policies into effect, the number of Jews
allowed to emigrate mushroomed from a few hundred a year to 33,444
in the first eight months of 1989.
   The United States increased its quota on Soviet refugees from
25,000 to 43,500 for fiscal 1989. But at the same time, it began to
insist last year that applicants prove their fears of persecution
were well-founded.
   Because of the change, the visa refusal rate in Rome has been
``around 20 percent,'' said U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hahn.
   The U.S. State Department expects an overwhelming 250,000
Soviets to apply for entry to the United States in 1990. But for
the new fiscal year, a proposal is being studied that would give
refugee status only to Soviet Jews with relatives or other ties to
the United States.
   Applicants denied refugee status would still be able to get a
visa, but they would have to find a sponsor to guarantee their
financial security and wait longer to become permanent residents.
   Agencies helping Soviet Jews are afraid the new regulations will
drive up the visa refusal rate. They have speeded up immigration
applications to fill the fiscal 1989 quota for Soviet refugees,
which had not yet been reached last week, according to Hahn.
   The organizations also fear cuts in funding for resettlement, so
they are trying to hasten the departure of all Soviets who have
been accepted as U.S. refugees.
   ``We're trying to send away as many people as possible before
the October deadline,'' said a representative of the New York-based
Hebrew Immigration Aid Society in Rome, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Everybody is concentrating on making these people leave, so we
don't even have time to do the statistics,'' she said, when asked
about the number of departures expected in September.
   Peter Schatzer, chief of mission in Rome for the International
Committee for Migration, said that many details can delay
departures.
   For example, the refugees must undergo a medical examination
before leaving. ``But in August, most Italian doctors are on
holidays,'' he said.
   The final decision on the new U.S. immigration regulations for
Soviet Jews is expected next month.
   On Thursday, like most recent mornings, Rome's airport resembled
a Moscow train station. Refugees waited anxiously at a meeting
point to receive their U.S. visas. In a corner, a family cried: the
poodle could not travel in the cabin.
   A middle-aged Soviet man with a bewildered look walked through
passport control with his wife and three children.
   ``So now we are free,'' he said softly.

   Churchgoers picked their way through
rubble Sunday to get to St. Philip's Episcopal Church, where the
choir read hymnals by candlelight and sang with a piano because the
electric organ was useless.
   ``If Hurricane Hugo has taught us anything, let it teach us
humility, how much we know our need for God,'' said the Rev. James
E. Hampton.
   One side of the 25-foot door was blown out of the church, whose
congregation dates back more than 300 years, and a copper roof was
peeled off a chapel by Hugo's fury. About 250 people walked or
eased their cars past downed palmetto trees and broken bricks.
   Fallen oaks rested on a portion of a wrought-iron fence. The
doors to the church were propped open for light because the
electricity still has not been restored.
   ``If God is good, why does he allow bad storms to take place?''
Hampton asked the congregation, some of them dressed in cleanup
jeans while others wore their Sunday finest.
   Perhaps, he said, ``God allowed that hurricane to hit Charleston
dead center because he wanted to punish Charlestonians for their
sins. ... Who knows?''
   Before the service, the congregation swapped information on how
friends and neighbors weathered the storm.
   By the time the choir and ministers proceeded out in song,
several in the congregation were wiping tears from their eyes.
   Jimmy Bailey, the Democrat who represents the district in the
state Legislature, said the service had special meaning for his
family, and many others.
   ``We have no roof and we've got three feet of water in the
living room,'' Bailey said. ``But we all have what we were born
with and that's good health. ... Anything else is just gravy.''
   Those with gas power offered hot meals and showers. Tom
Johnston, an attorney, offered use of his home to those needing it.
   ``My door is not going to be locked. Feel free to come in and
use it,'' he said.
   At St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Mount Pleasant, across the
harbor from Charleston, people hugged one another on the portico as
they gathered for morning services. Nearby, massive oaks blocked a
road.
   To the north, 50 churches in the Columbia area asked congregants
to make donations for the hurricane victims this week and next.
   ``The congregation has been asked to bring in food, clothes,
brooms, cleaning supplies, bottled water, bedding _ any household
items that are transportable,'' said LeGrand Cooper, administrator
at the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia. ``We're hearing
reports that people are waiting in line for hours to buy things.
So, we're trying to send items down they can use.''
   The Salvation Army is looking for volunteers to go Charleston
for at least three days to distribute donated items, said Major Ken
Bush of the Salvation Army in Columbia.

<HEAD>`Fed Up' DOE Boots Rockwell Following Threat, Lawsuit, Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockwell International Corp., which said it was
withdrawing as operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant,
actually was ousted because the government was ``fed up,'' a
federal official said.
   Department of Energy deputy secretary W. Henson Moore said
Rockwell officials did not know of the DOE's intention to sever
ties with the company until Friday morning, The Denver Post
reported in Sunday's editions.
   Official reports Friday had said Rockwell's departure from the
DOE plant was by mutual decision and gave no reason for the move.
   ``This Rockwell incident shows we're not going to be bullied or
buffaloed or scared,'' Moore, second in command at the DOE to
Energy Secretary James Watkins, told the newspaper Saturday.
``We're willing to do exactly what we're doing. We're not going to
tolerate less than the performance we want.''
   The federal government is investigating possible environmental
crimes at Rocky Flats, 15 miles northwest of Denver, which makes
plutonium triggers for thermonuclear boms.
   The plant was raided June 6 by more than 70 federal agents. A
special federal grand jury in Denver is reviewing evidence obtained
during the raid as part of an investigation into the alleged
coverup of illegal hazardous and radioactive waste-disposal
practices.
   Rockwell's ouster stemmed in part from its threat the previous
week to shut down Rocky Flats if the company was not given
protection from prosecution for environmental violations at the
plant, Moore said.
   ``The last straw,'' he said, the step that left the DOE ``fed
up,'' was when Rockwell sued the government Thursday, seeking a
temporary injunction to prohibit such prosecution.
   Rockwell spokesman Dennis Hurtt, reached Sunday by telephone at
home in Denver, said the company had no immediate response to
Moore's comments.
   Moore said Watkins had contacted EG&amp;G Inc. of Wellesley, Mass.,
last Monday, to see if the $1.4 billion scientific engineering
company was interested in replacing Rockwell at Rocky Flats. The
company was named Friday as the new Rocky Flats contractor.
   EG&amp;G already operates the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
which operates test reactors; the Nevada Test Site where nuclear
weapons are tested; and the Mound Facility at Miamisburg, Ohio,
where detonators for nuclear warheads are made.
   Moore said Watkins telephoned Rockwell Chairman Donald Beall on
Friday to notify him of the decision.
   Rockwell was hailed as a white knight when it took over Rocky
Flats from then-beleaguered Dow Chemical in 1975.
   Moore said Saturday that Rockwell received a
``less-than-satisfactory'' performance evaluation _ the worst
evaluation ever given a DOE contractor _ for its operations at
Rocky Flats during the six months ending March 31, 1989. The
company got bonuses nonetheless, but, Moore said, they were about
half of the $4 million to $5 million Rockwell had expected to
receive.
   Under a new DOE performance evaluation system, which gives more
weight to environmental health and safety at its facilities,
Rockwell would have received no bonus at all for those six months,
Moore said.
   Rockwell officials have said they do not plan to drop the
lawsuit against the government.
   Moore called the lawsuit ``meaningless.'' ``We really never did
pay much attention to the lawsuit. Now that they're going to be out
of the contract, what's the point?'' he asked.
   Representatives of EG&amp;G were to arrive Monday to begin the
management transition.
   Moore said Rockwell's five-year, $2.5 billion contract to
operate the plant was being sweetened to appease EG&amp;G concerns
about taking over the troubled plant.
   ``Obviously, EG&amp;G officials have concerns about their company's
equity,'' Moore said.
   EG&amp;G also has had environmental problems and violations at DOE
facilities it manages.
   Moore, however, said most of the problems at those facilities
were inherited by EG&amp;G.
   ``They're a first-class company with a tremendous amount of
experience with nuclear matters,'' Moore said. ``They know the
business. They know the problems.''

   As the first Soviet citizen enrolled in
the Ivy League, Natalia Tsarkova wants to make the most of her time
at Harvard University by learning to think independently.
   She intends to start by studying the Russian Revolution from a
Western perspective.
   Tsarkova, who transferred from the University of Latvia in Riga
after her freshman year, arrived recently to start her sophomore
year at Harvard as an emblem of the ebbing Cold War and of the
widening freedoms permitted the Soviet people.
   Another Soviet woman is enrolled at Emory College in Atlanta,
and the two could become the first Soviet citizens to earn degrees
from American colleges. Previously, the only Soviets studying in
the United States were defectors or exchange students who don't get
degrees from the colleges they visit.
   Her tuition and other expenses, totaling around $19,000 a year,
are being paid for by a combination of financial aid from Harvard
and the campus job she will have under a work-study program.
   The enthusiastic 19-year-old student said she plans to return to
her homeland.
   ``I didn't come because the state sent me, and it's not my duty
to go back, but I love the people there,'' said Tsarkova. ``They
are just individuals trying to have a better life, and I want to
help them out.''
   She can help her compatriots by going home with an outlook
refreshed by her time in America, said Tsarkova, who lives off
campus in a Cambridge apartment with roommates from Arizona and
Texas.
   ``You can understand things better when you are out of a
place,'' she said.
   Tsarkova, whose parents are mathematics professors, was 15 years
old when perestroika and glasnost began to reform Soviet culture,
and the ensuing turmoil helped her to find out what she needs from
her Harvard education.
   ``I want to learn how to think independently,'' said Tsarkova.
   ``Now in the Soviet Union, it is a period of confusion for the
normal person,'' she said. ``There are so many beats of new
information, and there are no straight answers.
   ``Before, every answer was given to us, and that was a bad
thing, the worst thing ever, but now people have the opportunity to
think finally, and nobody's tried to do this before.''
   The desire to see things from a new perspective prompted her to
take Social Studies 10, which covers the Russian Revolution.
   ``Why did it go this way? Was the dictatorship inevitable? Was
Stalin inevitable? Those questions are very important to me,'' she
said.
   Tsarkova said she doesn't find writing in English difficult,
because she reads a lot of English books. In fact, she wants to
write for The Harvard Crimson, the campus newspaper.
   ``And I think I will learn where to put the right commas,'' she
said.
   Knowing about commas will be crucial for Tsarkova's ambition,
which includes a foray into what she called ``international
journalism.'' She dreams of being host of an international
television show from the United Nations.
   ``I want this show to present objective information, and
transferred by satellite everywhere, to Moscow, to Washington,
because I think we are all citizens of the world, not of any one
nation,'' she said.
   In part because of her feelings of international kinship,
Tsarkova said she hopes to meet a celebrated Harvard student from
another communist country: Wu'er Kaixi, who escaped from his native
China last spring, after helping lead student protests in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   ``I would really love to meet him, especially because we have
similar ... we have similar and different problems. And I would
appreciate the possibility of meeting a Chinese,'' she said.

   Chinese exiles on Sunday chose a student protest
leader and a former government official to lead an international
movement to end Communist rule in China.
   On the final day of a three-day inaugural meeting of the
Federation of Democracy in China, delegates elected former
government adviser Yan Jiaqi as chairman and student protest leader
Wu'er Kaixi as vice-chairman.
   ``I'm very familiar with political science, but I'm not that
familiar with politics,'' said Yan, former director of the
Institute of Political Science, a Chinese think tank that advised
the government on political reforms.
   ``Still, I think my firm belief in a fair and democratic
political process will be an advantage in this first year,'' he
said in an interview.
   The 47-year-old Yan is on China's wanted list, accused of
``counterrevolutionary crimes.''
   He worked closely with the students' who occupied Beijing's
central Tiananmen Square for weeks until they were crushed in an
armed military attack June 3-4.
   Chinese authorities say 300 people were killed, including dozens
of security personnel, but witnesses and Western diplomats say
hundreds, perhaps thousands may have died.
   Wu'er, 21, is one of the best-known of 21 student leaders
accused of ``counterrevolutionary crimes.'' In a national TV
newscast, he confronted hard-line Premier Li Peng, and fainted
after his speech.
   He was smuggled out of China in late June. He was a student at
Beijing Normal University and is now studying at Harvard University.
   ``All of my views aren't always those of Yan Jiaqi, but I think
that's good, it is democracy,'' he told delegates. ``Everything
with us must be open, everyone must be heard. But democracy is not
the end, its the means, the means to a brighter future for China.''
   The new group favors economic sanctions to put pressure on the
Communist authorities and encourage its aims of bringing democracy
and respect for human rights to China, ending one-party rule and
developing an open economy that responds to market forces.
   Jiaqi and Wu'er won by a vote of 96-44 against two challengers
from California _ Xu Sike, a doctoral candidate in music at
Stanford University, and Yang Jian Li, a student at the University
of California at Berkeley.

   Incarcerations for convicted drug offenders
more than doubled in five states between 1983 and 1986, the Justice
Department said Sunday.
   The 104 percent increase in prison or jail sentences caused the
overall number of incarcerations to increase 28 percent, the study
said.
   The department's Bureau of Justice Statistics looked at arrests,
prosecutions and convictions in California, Minnesota, New York,
Pennsylvania and Virginia. The proportion of convicted defendants
imprisoned or jailed increased for each category of offense:
violent crimes, property crimes, drug crimes and public-order
crimes.
   According to the report, 62 percent of the 1.9 million people
arrested during that period were convicted. Thirty-nine percent of
the people arrested went on to jail or prison.
   Of those convicted, 67 percent went on to state or local jails,
15 percent were fined, and 18 percent received probation.
   An arrest was not recorded for purposes of the study until the
case was disposed of with either a verdict or a decision not to
prosecute.
   Arrests for drug offenses increased 52 percent, prosecutions
rose 61 percent and convictions for those crimes went up 71 percent
during the four-year period, said the report from the bureau's
Offender Based Transaction Statistics Program.
   The study said 74 percent of all convicted drug offenders
received a jail or prison term during the period, compared with 67
percent of those convicted of violent crimes.
   The percentage of arrested drug offenders who were incarcerated
upon conviction increased from 71 percent in 1983 to 83 percent by
1986.
   The proportion of drug offenders who did not receive a prison or
jail term after conviction dropped from 29 percent in 1983 to 17
percent in 1986.
   Drug arrests increased from 68,447 in 1983 to 103,826 in 1986
while prosecutions for those crimes went from 50,918 to 81,992
during the period, the study said.
   The study found that 1.1 million of people arrested for all
crimes during the period were convicted. Forty-six percent of those
arrested were charged with a property crime, while 24 percent were
accused of a violent offense.
   Sixteen percent were arrested on drug charges and 13 percent on
public-order offenses.
   Ninety percent of those arrested for violent crimes were men.
   Women accounted for 15 percent of drug arrests and 17 percent of
arrests for property crimes.
   The statistics were collected from the participating states,
which collected fingerprint cards and disposition records.
   People who were arrested on drug crimes were also more likely to
be imprisoned if convicted. Additional states are expected to
participate over the next few years, the department said.
   The study did not provide a state-by-state breakdown of the
figures collected from the five states.

<HEAD>Reformer Says Ruling Party No Longer To Be Considered Communist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reformist Politburo member Imre Pozsgay
said Sunday the ruling Hungarian Socialist Workers Party will no
longer be considered a communist party, the official MTI news
agency reported.
   Pozsgay, a leading reformer who is also one of the country's
four-member leadership, said the change would take effect after a
party congress next month. He also said he would quit the party
should its reform wing be defeated at the congress, which begins
Oct. 6.
   Although officially designated ``socialist,'' the party took
power in 1947-48 as the Hungarian Communist Party. It was renamed
and reorganized in the wake of the 1956 popular uprising that was
crushed by Soviet tanks and troops.
   MTI, paraphrasing Pozsgay's comments in an interview with
Italian television, quoted him as saying that after the congress,
the Socialist Workers Party ``will call itself simply a socialist
party'' and will no longer be ``a communist party in the Bolshevik
and Stalinist sense of the word.''
   Pozsgay has been at the forefront of political change in
Hungary. He was among the first officials to publicly declare that
the 1956 events were not a counterrevolution but a popular movement.
   In numerous interviews, Pozsgay has insisted there is no
alternative to Hungary becoming a multi-party democracy.
   ``In our endeavors, we feel related to the socialist parties of
western Europe,'' Pozsgay was quoted as saying of the party.
   Should the reformers not win at the congress next month _ which
would imply a halt to party reforms _ he would ``not remain in an
obsolete organization,'' Pozsgay was quoted as saying.
   In its session Tuesday, Parliament will discuss and vote on key
legislation for Hungary's transformation into a multiparty state.
The first free elections since the communist takeover will be held
by June 1990.
   Draft laws before parliament include constitutional changes, a
law on the activity of political parties, the establishment of a
constitutional court, an electoral law, a change in the penal code
and in criminal proceedings.
   Those legislative items were agreed upon after negotiations
between the ruling communists and the political opposition.
   Also under Hungary's political reforms, in mid-September,
Budapest opened its borders with Austria, allowing more than 17,000
East German refugees to flee to the West.

<HEAD>L.A. County Spends Hundreds of Thousands to Fight Welfare Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The county has paid a law firm more than
$360,000 in the last year to fight allegations that homeless people
have been unfairly denied $312 a month in benefits, county records
show.
   The expenditures, mainly from funds that would otherwise be used
for welfare programs, do not include payments made during the past
three months.
   The action has drawn scathing criticism from attorneys
representing the homeless in the nearly 4-year-old case.
   ``Settling would cost a trivial amount compared to what they've
already paid,'' said Gary Blasi, an attorney for the Legal Aid
Foundation of Los Angeles, which is involved in the case.
   He estimated it would cost the county $100,000 to overhaul its
application process to one that would ensure eligible people are
not denied benefits. Estimates were not available for how much the
county might pay in additional benefits.
   ``Their top lawyers get in an hour what a general relief person
gets in a month,'' said Julie P. Downey, an assistant city attorney
also involved in the case. ``They've got to feel some kind of
uneasiness about taking public dollars, especially with the
reputation that lawyers have.''
   The private law firm retained by the county said it was hired to
defend against the lawsuit after the county counsel's office
decided it was not equipped to do so.
   ``There is undoubtedly a substantial cost involved in this
litigation, but I think it certainly involves issues that are
extremely important to the citizens of the country and the citizens
of the county,'' said Nowland C. Hong, the lead lawyer on the case.
   Lawyers for the homeless have accused the county and its
Department of Public Social Services of making the welfare
application procedure so confusing that many poor and homeless
people abandon efforts to claim benefits to which they are entitled.
   When the first part of the lawsuit was filed in 1986, Superior
Court Judge John L. Cole was among those who criticized the process.
   ``I don't understand some of the forms myself,'' he said.

<HEAD>Record Chill From The Plains To The Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A large high-pressure area and lack of cloud cover contributed
to record low temperatures early Sunday from the Plains to the
central Appalachians and from the Great Lakes all the way to the
Mexican border.
   Florida, on the other hand, posted a record high temperature
along with up to 4 inches of rain.
   It was the earliest freeze on record for Fayetteville, Ark.,
which dropped to 32 degrees, and Springfield, Mo., which also hit
32. Topeka, Kan., had its second earliest freezing temperature on
record with a low of 31. It was the coldest September reading on
record at Abilene, Texas, at 38; Jackson, Ky., at 34; and Midland,
Texas, at 36.
   Nearly 50 cities reached or tied record lows Sunday morning,
including Del Rio, Texas, on the Mexican border, which cooled to 51
degrees.
   Other records included 30 at Bluefield, W.Va.; 29 at Dubuque,
Iowa; and 36 at Oklahoma City. Chicago tied its record of 35 and
Detroit tied its record of 34.
   Sunday's low in the Lower 48 states was 22 at Langdon, N.D.
   Frost and-or freeze advisories were posted late Sunday and early
Monday across northern and central Lower Michigan, and from the
central Appalachians to inland sections of New England.
   Over the desert Southwest and Florida, however, afternoon
temperatures remained in the 80s and 90s. Key West tied its record
high for the date of 92 degrees.
   The strong cold front that brought the dramatic cold to the
central and eastern sections of the nation moved well off the
Atlantic Coast, and when it moved across the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast states, it generated high wind that caused damage
and created high surf.
   Wind gusted to 65 mph late Saturday at the Chesapeake Bay Bridge
Tunnel near Norfolk, Va. Trees were damaged by high wind near
Eureka, N.C., the National Weather Service said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were confined to Florida, southern
Alabama and southern Georgia during Sunday afternoon, producing
locally heavy rain and wind as high as 40 mph.
   In Florida, Glenlea had gotten 4.29 inches of rain since
Saturday, Sandalwood got 4.38 inches, and Apalachicola received
1.20 inches in an hour and by midafternoon had recorded 4.01 inches
since morning.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 2.04 inches of rain fell
at Mayport, Fla.

<HEAD>Suspect Says Official Offered to Help Him Out of Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A retired army officer wanted in Colombia in
connection with the training of drug-cartel militias claimed Sunday
that an Israeli Embassy official offered to smuggle him from Bogota
for $10,000.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said the claim was
``totally unfounded.''
   The spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity, said the
Embassy official, security chief Yossi Biran, would remain at his
post.
   Retired Lt. Col Yair Klein said Biran offered to smuggle him out
of Colombia in April after threats on Klein's life were reported in
the Colombian media.
   ``He thought we were in trouble, and he wanted to help us,''
Klein told The Associated Press on Sunday. ``He did this on his
own, without permission from the Embassy and without its
involvement.''
   The Colombian government issued an arrest warrant for Klein on
Sept. 18 after a police investigation uncovered evidence of his
involvement in training militias for drug cartels.
   Klein denied any knowledge of the warrant and said he would not
return to Colombia because ``leftists would like to see me dead or
in jail because of my work.''
   Klein says he trained right-wing ranchers to fight left-wing
guerrillas. He says his work was legal and he left Colombia legally.
   Israel has no extradition treaty with Colombia. Klein said he is
only willing to submit to questioning at Colombia's Tel Aviv
embassy.
   Klein and five other Israelis from his Hod Hahanit private
security firm were investigated by Israeli police earlier this
month on suspicion of training gunmmen in Colombia and illegally
exporting military expertise.
   The investigation began in August following reports from
Colombia that Israelis were involved in training paramilitary

   Staff Sgt. Bill Petty cried when he saw
the desperation of people who pushed, shoved and slugged it out
while waiting hours in line to buy a bag of ice.
   ``People were pitiful. They were begging for ice,'' said Petty,
one of 1,400 South Carolina National Guardsmen mobilized in the
wake of Hurricane Hugo. ``There were fistfights in the line. They
were down-on-the ground fights - men and women.''
   In a city left without electricity and other basic services
since late Thursday, Petty and other soldiers have helped keep
order as people stand in line to buy ice or fill up jugs and
containers with fresh water.
   Petty said people began lining up at 6 a.m. Saturday when a
private company sold 50-pound bags of ice for $6 apiece. Guardsmen
and police were sent to help control the crowd, which grew to 3,000
by 2 p.m. About 500 people were still in line when the supply ran
out.
   ``Everybody waits for ice,'' he said. ``We had people in
wheelchairs. We had a woman who had recently had three (heart)
bypasses. There were rich people, poor people, whites and blacks.''
   Petty said some people left children to guard the 50-pound bags
while they went for a car and found the ice stolen when they
returned.
   ``I hope it never happens in my hometown,'' said Petty, a
businessman in Union in northern South Carolina. ``I don't mind
saying that I cried.''
   Brig. Gen. Frank Jones, commander of the guard's task force,
said many guardsmen are helping to maintain law and order in the
hurricane disaster area. Others are helping to clear streets,
remove fallen trees from power lines, operate water purification
equipment and hand out water.
   Guardsmen patrol the streets during the 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew,
when the city is dark because power remains out. They are also
stationed around the clock at key locations to prevent looting.
   Staff Sgt. James W. Shugart of Lockhart, appearing tired after a
night of road patrols when the city was without lights or signs of
normal activity.
   ``It's a weird feeling. It's scary out there,'' said Shugart, a
textile mill worker. ``You don't know what to expect. There are no
lights. You don't see anything open.''
   The guardsmen are quartered near an armory by the Johnson Hagood
Stadium, where the Citadel plays football. They sleep in tents, in
trucks or beneath the stars and survive on Army field rations.
   ``The community has just been outstanding to us,'' said Jones,
president of the Davis National Bank in Mullins and commander of
the 218th Infantry Brigade. ``I was told people have offered them
food, water and bathroom facilities.''
   Jones believes the guard has made a difference in the city.
   ``I feel confident with the show of force we've had, in
conjunction with the civilian law-enforcement personnel, that it
has been helpful in deterring looting,'' Jones said.
   Spec. David McCarley of Union said he's been protecting damaged
businesses during his six- and eight-hour tours of guard duty.
   ``A lot of the stores are unsecured,'' he said. ``The people
have been real friendly. They told us they appreciate us being down
here.''

<UNK>Columbia Hit By Water From Extingusher</UNK>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Space shuttle Columbia was sprayed
with an undetermined amount of water when a fire extinguisher
system unexpectedly came on for several minutes Sunday, NASA
reported.
   Space agency spokesman Dick Young said technicians were
examining the ship to see if any damage was done. An investigation
was under way to determine what triggered the water system, he
said. It normally would be set off by high heat.
   The mishap occurred while Columbia was in a processing building
being readied for a December flight. Young said it was too early to
determine whether that schedule would be affected.
   Young said Columbia's power was off and its two 60-foot-long
cargo bay doors were closed at the time of the incident. Damage, if
any, would be confined to thermal tiles that fit on the outside of
the vehicle and protect it from heat during re-entry into Earth's
atmosphere from orbit.
   Columbia's made its first flight in more than 3{ years last
month.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Parliament Condemns Annexation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lithuanian parliament approved a report that
says the 1940 Soviet annexation of the Baltic republic occurred
against the will of the people, an activist said Sunday.
   Activists have said they intend to use the report as the basis
for an eventual referendum on secession from the Soviet Union, on
the grounds that the annexation was illegal.
   The parliament voted Saturday on the document that has angered
Kremlin authorities, said Ramone Sakaloskaite of the Lithuanian
people's front, Sajudis.
   The report was prepared by a local commission set up to study
the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, under which the Soviet Union and Nazi
Germany divided Poland and the Baltic states between themselves.
   The parliamentary commission said in August that ``the
realization of the illegal German-Soviet agreements of 1939 to 1941
constitute an international crime.''
   In addition, the report says that the Lithuanian law approving
the Soviet annexation in 1940 was beyond the power of the
parliament of that time and occurred ``absolutely against the will
of the citizens of Lithuania.''
   On Tuesday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Communist Party
leaders that the Baltic republics joined the Soviet Union of their
own free will.
   Lithuania was the first of the three Baltic republics to
challenge formally the legitimacy of Soviet rule. Estonia and
Lativia reportedly were considering similar moves.
   All three have pressed for greater economic and political
independence from Moscow and some activists want the republics to
secede.
   Meanwhile, the parliaments of Kirgizia and Kazakhstan in Central
Asia passed controversial laws making their native tongues the
official languages of those republics, Tass said Sunday.
   The laws give certain workers several years to adapt, the
official Soviet news agency said.
   The parliament of nearby Turkmenia decided to expand teaching of
the Turkmen language and culture, while the parliament of
Tadzhikistan voted to make it a crime to violate ``the equality of
languages,'' Tass said.
   New language laws restoring the use of local tongues have
spawned strikes in other Soviet republics, including Moldavia and
Estonia.

   The Gallows Bay Crab &amp;
Oyster House carried an encouraging sign in its window.
   ``Open,'' it read. ``Today's Special _ Food!''
   A week after Hurricane Hugo ravaged the island of St. Croix,
followed by widespread looting, dazed residents slowly are getting
their lives back in order.
   Relief supplies have arrived, power crews have begun work on
electrical lines and a few businesses have re-opened. On the
sidewalk in front of one boarded-up photo shop, a merchant sold
boxes of film from a table on Saturday.
   Two radio stations began operating again on limited power and
telephone service has been restored between St. Croix and
neighboring St. Thomas, which suffered less damage.
   Still, the hurricane's is not forgotten. A utility storage tank
damaged by the hurricane is spilling 7,000 gallons of fuel oil a
day into the waters around Christiansted, the capital of St. Croix,
the Coast Guard said Sunday.
   In all, 40,000 gallons have flowed from a storage tank at a
Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority plant containing 1.6
million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil, the Coast Guard said in a
statement.
   The Coast guard said it hoped all oil would be removed from the
tank within the next two days.
   The more than 1,100 U.S. soldiers on the island have been
directing passengers at St. Croix airport and patrolling streets in
four-wheel drive vehicles. But the looting they were called in to
control stopped days ago.
   ``There really hasn't been much looting that we've observed
since we've arrived,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a
spokesman for the military contingent.
   The stores already had been stripped of their merchandise before
President Bush ordered the troops to fly to the U.S. territorial
island Thursday. Some residents complain the federal government
sent in guns when the 50,000 islanders desperately needed food.
   ``I don't see any need for this number of troops here,'' said
Dorene Carter, a nutritionist and Red Cross volunteer. ``The United
States should be ashamed.''
   Instead of roaming St. Croix with guns, the troops should be
helping rebuild the island, she said.
   Burnett said the troops were told to help local police maintain
order.
   Jan Hanley, president of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce, said
the troops were welcome.
   ``I think we need every bit of help that we can get from the
mainland,'' she said.
   Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said the relief response has been
tremendous, but officials are having problems getting supplies
organized and distributed. He said the troops will be used to help
rebuild the roads and bridges as well as maintain order.
   Hodge and others on the island said initial news reports about
the looting were overblown.
   ``We had no rioting,'' Hodge said, but the U.S. troops still
were needed because local police were too busy taking care of their
own families to maintain order. ``We had to fill that vacuum.''
   George Bagoon O'Reilly, a former territorial senator, said
residents panicked when they saw the damage caused by the first
hurricane to hit the island in more than 60 years.
   Some of those who looted were stealing whatever they could find,
but O'Reilly said he and others were simply salvaging food from
damaged stores.
   ``It was blacks. It was whites,'' he said. ``Everybody was
looting.''
   The troops arrived too late to serve any purpose, O'Reilly said.
   ``People just don't like it,'' he said. ``All we want now is
just some electrical power.''
   Hodge said he expects the troops will stay another week or so.
   At least one member of the U.S. military force got an early trip
home over the weekend.
   National Guard member Darren Floyd was called to the island a
day before the hurricane slammed into his hometown of Charleston,
S.C. Floyd got permission to leave so he could check on heavy
damage to his home and his family's antique business.
   ``It's kind of ironic to send me here to help these people,'' he
said.

<HEAD>West Must Be Ready to Help Eastern European Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with additional Brady comments on Third World
debt and proposed increase in IMF resources; edits to tighten</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance ministers from the world's richest
nations on Sunday termed as historic and dramatic the changes
occurring in Eastern Europe and said the West must do its all to
assist the reforms occurring in the Communist world.
   The upheaval in the Soviet bloc grabbed center stage as the
annual meetings of the 152-nation International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank got underway. The more traditional global economic
issues, such as huge trade imbalances and Third World debt
problems, also were addressed.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said the events occurring in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were changing the world and
were ``the most significant event perhaps since the end of World
War II.''
   Brady and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told
reporters that the meetings of the so-called Group of Seven _ the
United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy and
Canada _ had been dominated by the discussions concerning Eastern
Europe.
   ``What is happening in Poland and Hungary is of historic and
momentous importance and the major nations of the West must be
prepared to do all we can to help them change their economies, just
as they are changing their politics, from Communism to a democratic
system,'' Lawson said.
   Both Poland and Hungary are members of the IMF and World Bank,
making them eligible for financial assistance. Just last week the
Soviet Union said it, too, intended to apply for membership in the
two international lending organizations.
   In other remarks Sunday before the IMF policy-making interim
committee, Brady said that the United States still remains opposed
to an increase in the resources of the IMF, despite a plea from IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus that IMF lending resources need
to be doubled from $120 billion currently to $240 billion to meet
growing needs of impoverished Third World nations.
   ``A fully persuasive case has not been made that there is a
pressing need for additional resources at this time,'' Brady said.
But he added that the administration was still reviewing the
proposal and would not make a final determination until the end of
the year.
   Because of the U.S. share of voting rights in the IMF, any
proposal to boost IMF resources would have to have the backing of
the United States.
   On the issue of Third World debt, Brady said that the debt
reduction initiative he unveiled last March was a significant step
forward in dealing with a ``growing sense of helplessness'' in the
global debt crisis but he cautioned against unreasonable
expectations.
   ``Excessive expectations can only promote delays, increase the
risk of breakdown in negotiations and ultimately raise the economic
costs both to the banks and debtor countries,'' he said.
   The Bush administration and other governments have said there is
a need for the two international lending organizations to redefine
their roles to meet changing needs. Many see helping Communist
countries enter the global economy as a primary job for the two
organizations in the next decade.
   Poland became the first government in the East bloc not led by
the Communists earlier this month and the country is currently
negotiating with the IMF for assistance.
   The new Polish government is trying to combat food shortages and
soaring inflation while replacing the state-run economy with a more
market-based system.
   The discussions at the IMF-World Bank meetings follow up on
pledges of increased aid made by the G-7 countries at their annual
economic summit in Paris, a meeting President Bush attended after
making stops in both Poland and Hungary.
   Brady said that no country made any specific further commitments
to assistance during the weekend discussions, but the final G-7
communique did pledge ``strong support'' for the reform efforts,
including rescheduling under more favorable terms for the part of
Poland's $42 billion in debt being held by the United States and
other governments.
   Finance ministers dodged questions Sunday about how they planned
to back up their pledge made in the G-7 communique issued late
Saturday to keep the dollar from rising. Brady and the other
finance ministers promised joint action to combat a further rise in
the dollar's value, saying such an event could jeopardize efforts
to narrow the huge U.S. trade deficit.
   Brady on Sunday said the United States was doing its part to
correct its trade problems by reducing the U.S. federal budget
deficit, an action U.S. allies have long called for as a way of
reducing America's need for foreign financing.
   He called on countries running trade surpluses, such as Japan
and West Germany, to do more to boost domestic growth and thus
provide a larger market for sales of exports from the United States
and other countries.
   ``The United States cannot solve the world's problems alone,''
Brady said. ``The surplus countries must also implement policies to
sustain domestic growth and open their economies.''
   In its annual world economic outlook, the IMF projected Sunday
that the deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. trade, the current
account, would total $125.1 billion this year, only a slight
improvement from the 1988 level, but would widen sharply to $138.7
billion in 1990.
   If this occurs, it would be a setback to Bush administration
hopes for continued improvement in trade as a way of keeping the
domestic economy growing.

<TEXT>
   Grief-stricken neighbors watched Sunday as a
soft-drink delivery truck and a school bus carrying federal
investigators retraced the path of a collision that killed 20
students.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said the tests helped
determine the speed the bus was traveling Thursday on the two-lane
road in southern Texas, 15 miles from the Mexico border.
   ``We feel reasonably comfortable that the speed of the bus was
somewhere in the range of, give or take, 30 miles per hour,'' said
NTSB member Lee Dickinson.
   The speed limit on the road the bus was traveling is 55 mph.
   Dickinson said tests showed the school bus and the Dr Pepper
truck could see each other within a range of 150 feet as they
approached an intersection.
   The truck driver told authorities that his brakes failed and he
went through a stop sign, striking the bus and sending it tumbling
into the pit.
   There were 81 aboard the bus; 20 died and 61 survived. Funerals
for the last four victims were scheduled for Monday. The bus
driver, in stable condition, and two girls, in critical condition,
remained hospitalized Sunday.
   At the crash site Sunday was one of the students who escaped
from the submerged bus. Fourteen-year-old Edna Morales, who had
cuts on her neck and face and bandages on her left arm and right
leg, came in hopes it might cure her of the nightmares she has
experienced since the accident.
   Miss Morales, the last student to board the bus, told
investigators she got on the bus about 800 feet from the crash
site. Her description of the bus' acceleration helped investigators
arrive at the estimated 30 mph speed.
   For about 75 others who gathered to watch the test, Sunday's
re-enactment was yet another occasion to remember the dead students
from Mission High School and Mission Junior High. The tests were
conducted about the same time as the 7:25 a.m. accident.
   ``Who would think that this would happen in this little town?''
said Gloria Rivera, who watched the re-enactment while on her way
to deliver tamales to the family of one of the victims.
   Adrian Escobedo, 15, brought a video camera to make a tape of
the tests. Escobedo said he was a neighbor and good friend of
Michael and David Saens, two brothers killed in the wreck and
buried Saturday.
   ``I was going to show it to their mother,'' he said.
   Another friend of the Saens brothers, 17-year-old Veronica
Salinas, wept as she recalled Michael helping another student with
algebra the night before the wreck and David being excited about
playing in his first junior high football game.
   Friday's classes were canceled, as were all weekend school
activities, but the two schools were to reopen Monday.
   ``I feel that it's going to be very hard for me to go in class
with their seats empty,'' said 16-year-old Magdalee Salazar, a
Mission High School junior who knew four of the victims.
   Veronica Salinas, 17, a Mission High student who lost two close
friends in the accident, said, ``It's hard to think that one moment
they're with us and the next moment they are gone.'' Returning to
class, she added, will be ``very hard, very different.''
   In conducting the tests Sunday morning, investigators were among
42 people who boarded a school bus similar to the one involved in
the accident. They also used a Dr Pepper tractor pulling the same
trailer involved in the accident so that the trailer's brakes could
be tested. Investigators found no evidence of brake failure on the
trailer.
   A previous NTSB inspection indicated no evidence of brake system
failure on the truck, disputing truck driver Ruben Perez's claim to
Texas Department of Public Safety officers that the brakes had
failed.
   Acting on the advice of his attorney, Perez refused Saturday to
talk with NTSB officials.

   Shoney's Restaurant did non-stop business since reopening 9:30
a.m. Saturday.
   ``The line has been around the building,'' said manager Jane
Ingram.
   In Charleston, a prayer service was held at St. Philip's
Episcopal Church, a 17th-century church that lost a door and a
copper roof.
   ``If Hurricane Hugo has taught us anything, let it teach us
humility, how much we know our need for God,'' said the Rev. James
E. Hampton, whose choir read hymnals by candlelight and sang with a
piano because the electric organ was useless.
   At St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Mount Pleasant, across the
harbor from Charleston, people hugged one another on the portico as
they gathered for services. Nearby, massive oaks blocked a road.
   Fifty churches in the Columbia area asked congregants to make
donations for the hurricane victims.
   ``The congregation has been asked to bring in food, clothes,
brooms, cleaning supplies, bottled water, bedding _ any household
items that are transportable,'' said LeGrand Cooper, administrator
at the First Presbyterian Church in Columbia.
   About 200 volunteers formed a human chain to pass goods donated
Sunday into the Carolina Coliseum in Columbia. Within five hours, a
10,000-square-foot room with 12-foot high ceilings was packed with
goods for coastal communities, church officials said.
   More than half the homes on the Isle of Palms, a barrier island
that took the brunt of the killer storm, are structurally unsafe
and many stood one just one or two stilts. Propane gas leaked and
power lines, trees and debris cluttered roads.
   Because police drove their cruisers to the mainland before Hugo
struck, the 15-member police department patrolled in garbage
trucks, on golf carts and on bicycles.
   Acting Deputy Police Chief James Meade quit Saturday night
because Mayor Carmen Bunch refused to let residents return home to
inspect the damage.
   ``We had heard they were going to storm the island,'' said Capt.
James Arnold, who replaced Meade. ``To prevent that, he was trying
to coordinate the orderly transportation to residents so we could
control it.''
   Ms. Bunch did not immediately return a message seeking comment
Sunday.
   Arnold said residents can return under police guidance Monday to
inspect damage. It will be midweek before they will be able to
return to stay, he said.
   The Army's 82nd Airborne Division was scheduled to fly personnel
carriers onto ravaged Isle of Palms, and the Navy planned to send
heavy equipment and Seabee's _ members of its Civil Engineer Corps
_ into Charleston Air Force Base to clean up damage there.
   Carl Simmons, director of buildings for Charleston County,
estimated damage to buildings at $1.9 billion after taking an
aerial survey Saturday. Tourism officials put damage to structures
associated with their industry at $2 billion.
   The Charleston City Council Saturday night approved an emergency
order prohibiting price gouging. Violators face 30-day jail terms
and fines.
   Sporadic reports of price-gouging Saturday included $600 for a
$150 chain saw, $10 for a bag of ice and $1,000 for a $300
generator.
   On Saturday, motorists turned one lane of a road into a parking
lot when they jumped out of their cars to get ice that was being
distributed at a Charleston mall. At another mall, a crowd waiting
for an ice giveaway started pushing and shoving, police said. There
were no arrests.

<HEAD>European Air Traffic Congestion Worst in World, Jane's Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release 8 p.m. EDT, Time set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe's skies are the most crowded in the world,
and a single air traffic control network is needed to replace the
current patchwork system, the editor of an industry yearbook said
Monday.
   David Rider, editor of the authoritative ``Jane's Airport
Equipment,'' also said the U.S. deregulation of its airline
industry has saved American passengers $100 billion in the last 11
years.
   Rider said 42 air traffic control centers now use 22 different
systems to communicate with one another in Europe ``in a most
inefficient and time-consuming way.''
   A flight from London to Athens, for example, requires the
cooperation of seven countries and 50 air traffic controllers using
telex and telephones and spending a total of 35 manhours to arrange
the routes and timings, he said in the introduction to the latest
yearbook.
   Many bottlenecks in north-south routes stem from the absence of
a civil radar network in Greece, he said. Controllers there rely on
radio communication with pilots, meaning aircraft must stay 60
miles apart instead of three miles as they do in British airspace.
   Going east to west is not much better, he said. An aircraft
flying about 870 miles between Frankfurt to Madrid passes through
the control of seven centers.
   By contrast, in the United States, a flight of roughly the same
distance _ Chicago to Boston _ passes through only three centers,
he said.
   ``Congestion in the air as well as on the ground is a major
problem in Europe, and it is now deemed to be the worst in the
world,'' Rider wrote.
   A single, European system is the ``obvious solution,'' he said,
``but one which seems unpalatable to many countries since, if
implemented correctly, it would mean the unified control of both
civil and military airspace throughout Western Europe.''
   In his remarks on American deregulation, Rider said fares have
declined by one-fifth, after inflation is considered, because of
increased competition. However, he said increased traffic has led
to delays.
   He also said the December bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, has caused ``major reverberations'' with
governments, aviation authorities, airlines and airports worldwide.
   The introduction of new systems for controlling personnel and
baggage has helped reduce risk, he said.
   A total of 270 people were killed in the bombing of Flight 103.

   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, jailed 25 months ago in
a bitter child custody dispute, remains jailed until a nine-member
appeals panel rules on the request for her freedom, her attorney
said Sunday.
   Attorney Adrian Roe filed the papers with the District of
Columbia Court of Appeals on Saturday, just hours after President
Bush signed a bill designed to free her.
   ``We're hopeful the court will act promptly, but we have no
guarantees,'' Roe said, adding that all the appeals judges would
have to rule on the request.
   Morgan has been held in the District of Columbia Jail since
August 1987 for failing to produce the girl for court-ordered
visits by her ex-husband and the girl's father, Dr. Eric Foretich.
   Morgan hid the girl after alleging that Foretich had sexually
abused the girl. Foretich has repeatedly denied those charges and
at one point offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who could provide
information on their daughter's whereabouts.
   Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's attorney, told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview it was unlikely that Morgan would be freed
before court opened on Monday.
   ``I would think that she wouldn't be freed until we have had
time to file papers with the court stating our side of the
argument,'' Ms. Mittleman said.
   Foretich and Ms. Mittleman have stressed that the bill does not
require Ms. Morgan to produce the couple's 7-year-old daughter,
Hilary.
   Foretich said that he wants the federal government to give him
as much assistance in finding his daughter as it has given his wife
in her effort to be freed from jail.
   ``I think that someone in our government ought to assist me to
find my daughter,'' he said. ``And if they would do that. I'd be
delighted to have Elizabeth Morgan released (from jail). But until
they're willing to do that, I don't see where I have any choice but
to concern myself with the violation of my rights and those of my
daughter.''
   He and Ms. Mittleman have said it was unfair that his ex-wife
was getting such extraordinary preferential treatment from Congress
and the President.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Saturday that Bush
signed the bill ``out of compassion for her plight'' after members
of Congress, also concerned about her case, passed legislation that
enables her to be freed.
   The congressional bill will be applied retroactively to Morgan's
case.
   The child remains hidden at an undisclosed location, although
court officials believe the girl may be with Morgan's parents in
England.

   President Bush played a practical
joke on National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft at the golf
course Sunday, planting an exploding chalk ball for his aide on the
first tee.
   With a mighty swing, Scowcroft hit the ball solidly. It
disintegrated into a cloud of white dust.
   Like a naughty schoolboy, Bush turned aside laughing.
   Kay Raynor, the club pro at the Cape Arundel Golf Course and the
third member of Bush's golfing trio, told Scowcroft, ``The
president put me up to that. I apologize.'' Bush continued
chuckling from the side.
   Bush explained that he was trying to get Scowcroft to lighten up
after doing a television appearance on NBC-TV. ``He had to be on
`Meet the Press' _ all that serious stuff, and here he is,'' Bush
said.
   Scowcroft said, ``I should have known that looked too funny.''

   A house fire apparently caused by an
electrical short circuit killed a woman and her four children early
Sunday, authorities said. Two other relatives pulled from the
burning home were critically injured.
   The woman's husband, Joe Amador, learned of the tragedy when he
returned home from work and found firefighters battling the blaze.
   ``He told me thanks to his faith he wasn't going crazy.
Otherwise he wouldn't be able to face this tragedy,'' said the
family's pastor, the Rev. Jesus Garcia of Sacred Heart Roman
Catholic Church in Mathis, a town of about 7,000 in southern Texas,
30 miles northwest of Corpus Christi.
   Neighbors discovered the fire and called the Mathis Volunteer
Fire Department about 2 a.m., said Fire Chief Larry Wallek. He said
Department of Public Safety troopers made their way into the
burning home and carried out a woman and her grandchild.
   Nicolosa Gonzalez Amador, 67, and her grandson, Michael Rosales,
1{, were in critical condition at Corpus Christi hospitals,
officials said.
   The victims were identified as Yolanda Lopez Amador, 29; her
daughters, Yvette Amador, 2{, Leslie Angelica Amador, 4, and Lisa
Amador, 8; and son, Joe Angel Lopez, 9.
   Yolanda Lopez Amador was the daughter-in-law of Nicolosa
Gonzalez Amador and the aunt of Michael Rosales, who was staying
with the family for the night.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle and Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu agreed Monday on a new plan for cooperation
in space science, U.S. officials said.
   The two nations will work together on a project to measure the
effects of solar radiation on the earth's magnetic field, senior
U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity.
   Japan will provide a satellite and scientific instruments, and
the United States will provide equipment and launch the satellite
in 1992, according to a joint statement issued by Quayle and Kaifu.
   The agreement comes under Quayle's effort to develop a ``global
partnership'' with Japan.
   Quayle will suggest to Kaifu and other Japanese leaders that
their two nations work together on a wide range of issues,
including space, drugs, Third World debt and promotion of
democracy, one senior administration official said.
   Another senior administration official said both nations would
benefit from space cooperation, despite the potential for future
commercial competition in the area.
   ``The United States is committed to cooperative international
relations in space,'' the official said.
   Space is one area in which Japan still lags far behind the
United States and Europe. In 1989, Japan will spend $1.1 billion on
its space programs, compared with $9 billion spent by the U.S.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1988.
   The Japanese government has, however, targeted the area for high
priority development.
   In June, Japan's Science and Technology Agency announced it
planned to develop an unmanned space plane in the next decade and
eventually send its own astronauts into space aboard Japanese-made
spacecraft.
   It said the projects fall under a 10-year space program that
also calls for basic research on robots capable of assembling and
repairing earth-orbiting satellites and for developing a rocket
able to launch commercial satellite payloads.
   Japan's National Aerospace Laboratory already is participating
in a 12-nation space station program initiated by the United States
that begins in 1996.
   For that project, Japan is developing a manned space platform
with artificial pressure and gravity to provide an environment that
would minimize physical risks.
   Quayle, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday from South Korea, is in
Japan on the second leg of a tour through Asia. On Tuesday, he
leaves for the Philippines. He also is to visit Malaysia before
returning to Washington.

<HEAD>Interior Secretary to Set Up Groups to Aid Islands With Hurricane
Damage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, just back
from hurricane-ravaged St. Croix, said Sunday he will set up two
task forces to deal with the economic and environmental damages.
   ``The whole environment is really devastated,'' Lujan said in a
telephone interview. ``There's not a leaf on a tree anywhere. The
economy is flat on its back.''
   Lujan traveled over the weekend to Puerto Rico and St. Croix a
week after Hurricane Hugo swept through the Caribbean, felling
homes, downing power lines and weaving a wide swath of destruction.
   The secretary said a multi-agency group will deal with the
economic destruction as well as the environmental damages, which
included threats to the endangered Puerto Rican parrot and the
leatherback turtle. He also cited two oil leaks in St. Croix.
   A storage tank damaged by the hurricane is spilling 7,000
gallons of fuel oil a day into the waters around Christiansted, the
capital of St. Croix, the Coast Guard said Sunday.
   In all, 40,000 gallons have flowed from a storage tank at a
Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority plant containing 1.6
million gallons of No. 6 fuel oil, the Coast Guard said in a
statement.
   The Coast guard said it hoped all oil would be removed from the
tank within the next two days.
   ``Both of those (spills) are oozing oil into the ocean,'' Lujan
said. ``One of the things we're going to do ... is put together a
multi-discipline environmental assessment group to see how we deal
with all of those things.''
   To bolster the economy, the secretary said, he will seek a task
force to study ways to rebuild St. Croix's businesses and tourism
industry.
   ``All of the businesses have been damaged,'' Lujan said.
``Tourism is their primary activity and that is just dead in its
tracks. We have to get the resources of various agencies, perhaps
the small business associations, maybe HUD (Housing and Urban
Development), Farmers Home Administration, Department of Interior.''
   Lujan said he did not see any of the looting that had been
reported on St. Croix after the hurricane but said he would
recommend to President Bush that the 1,100 or so American troops
sent to help stay in place ``to allow for a little more
normalization.''

   Residents who threatened to storm
this barrier island that has been off-limits and under martial law
since Hurricane Hugo struck will get their first look at the
destruction on Monday.
   ``When you come to the island, you better wear boots. There are
snakes all over the place,'' Mayor Carmen Bunch told about 500
angry homeowners at a meeting Sunday in nearby Mount Pleasant.
   Ms. Bunch, who said her own house was demolished, told islanders
they will be taken by ferry for a brief look and then returned to
the mainland. It will be at least midweek before they can return to
stay, acting police chief Capt. James Arnold said.
   Many homes have been weakened by the storm or are standing on
just one or two stilts, Arnold said.
   ``(Saturday) night we just sat here and listened and we could
hear them falling and breaking. It's a very unsafe situation,''
Arnold said.
   Brushing back tears, the mayor asked people not to try to reach
the island on their own.
   ``We're going to build the island back. We've got to stop the
anarchy that's been talked about. We're not going to let anyone
take over the city by force,'' she said.
   Some threatend to return home after the mayor failed to show up
for a Saturday meeting.
   Ms. Bunch, with the permission of Gov. Carroll Campbell, placed
the island under martial law to keep order. The National Guard and
state wildlife officials are patrolling waterways to keep out all
but commercial fishermen and emergency crews.
   Several people have been arrested for looting, officials said,
and there is a danger to boaters from submerged boats, appliances
and debris in the surrounding waterways.
   The island's marina was blown 300 yards away. A pile of at least
two dozen yachts and sailboats, some worth $200,000 or more, are
crammed like sardines onto neighboring Goat Island.
   Sullivan's Island Mayor Melvin Anderegg also imposed martial law
but said a committee was set up to develop a plan to get residents
to their homes.
   ``If I had my way, I would keep people off for a couple more
days, but they'd lynch me,'' he said.
   John Selby, a resident of Sullivan's Island, said it was about
time.
   ``What the people are angry about is they can't go out, inspect
the property and maybe do a little damage control,'' Selby said.
   The Ben Sawyer bridge, which connects Sullivan's Island and Isle
of Palms to Mount Pleasant, is submerged in the Intracoastal
Waterway. It could be one or two weeks before a temporary bridge is
installed, said Herman Snyder, an engineer for the state Department
of Highways and Public Transportation.
   Sullivan's Island and Isle of Palms, located 15 miles from
Charleston, are home to about 6,000 people. They were the first to
feel the force of Hugo's 135 mph winds.

<TEXT>
   International conferences have failed to stop
production of chemical weapons, which could be made and used by
terrorists, the editor of an industry yearbook said Monday.
   Verification is one of the main stumbling blocks to any proposed
ban on chemical weapons because they can be made in commercial
factories or backroom workshops, Terry Gander said.
   Gander is editor of the second volume of the authoritative
yearbook ``Jane's NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) Protection
Equipment,'' published Monday.
   ``On a small scale, it could ... be possible to produce lethal
agents in backroom workshops ... and it would only take a few
small-scale uses of the resultant chemical weapons to run a
railroad through any treaty,'' Gander said.
   ``As yet, none of the numerous terrorist groups that infest the
modern world have turned their attention to the possible uses of
chemical warfare, but the potential for them to do so has been
around for a very long time,'' he said. ``It could be stated that
the actual event of such an attack taking place can only be a
matter of by whom, when and where.''
   Gander's warning was written ahead of the weekend agreement by
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to exchange data on chemical
weapons and to inspect each other's stockpiles and plants.
   Gander said the 40-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva
has progressed toward some form of ban on chemical weapons, it but
keeps stumbling over the verification problem.
   The disarmament conference has been debating a global convention
outlawing the production, stockpiling and use of chemical arms
since 1968.
   Policing and supervising every peaceful, commercial plant which
could also be used to produce chemical weapons would be a vast and
almost impossible task, even using satellite surveillance, Gander
said.
   Gander also warned that recent advances in genetic and related
technologies mean that biological warfare is ``a distinct
possibility in the very near future.''
   ``Several major powers have openly renounced all possible use of
such weapons, but the danger still lurks that some nations would be
only too happy to employ biological weapons to further their own
ends in some future conflict,'' he said.

   Mayoral candidate David Dinkins was shaken up
but not seriously injured when he was involved in an auto accident
en route to a campaign appearance Sunday, an aide said.
   ``Basically it was a bump on the head,'' said Stanley Davis,
deputy press secretary for Dinkins, who is Manhattan borough
president.
   Dinkins' aide, Barbara Fife, said Dinkins and three others were
riding in a car that was broadsided by another auto.
   The candidate resumed his campaign schedule after he was treated
at Metropolitan Hospital, Davis said. Dinkins was the winner of
this month's Democratic mayoral primary, toppling Mayor Edward I.
Koch.
   Police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell said the accident was under
investigation. Dinkin's driver and two people in the second auto
were also treated at the hospital, he said.

   Sixty-three photographers and
reporters who died in the Vietnam War were honored Sunday in a
tearful memorial on a Catskill mountain hilltop as remote as some
of the outposts they covered.
   The ceremony at the second annual Eddie Adams Workshop marked
the 150th anniversary of photography.
   Adams, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer of the Vietnam War
who planned the memorial on his workshop-farm, joined speakers in
recalling the courage of their friends and colleagues.
   Some of the speakers wept as they remembered their colleagues
and the ironies that led to their deaths. The moving tribute
brought tears to some of those among the more than 200
photographers, staff members and guests.
   A.M. Gray, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said those
journalsts who died ``made the ultimate sacrifice in recording
history for people of all countries throughout the world.
   ``Our nation owes these journalists and photographers its honor,
gratitude, and respect,'' said Gray, who was unable to attend the
ceremony but sent a letter that was read by his representative,
Maj. Gen. Don Miller, director of planning at Marine Corps
headquarters in Washington.
   The ceremony was held around a slate table inscribed with the
first names of six of Adam's best friends who died in Vietnam:
   Larry Burrows of Life Magazine, Henri Huet of The Associated
Press, Michel Laurent of Gamma, Kent Potter of United Press
International, Kyoichi Sawada of UPI and Huynh Thanh My of the AP.
   My's brother, Huynh Cong ``Nick'' Ut, who followed in his
footsteps with the AP and won a Pulitzer Prize, said that he was
``proud of the achievements and sacrifices sustained by our fallen
colleagues, including my brother.''
   Six small blue spruce trees were planted aound the slate table,
one for each of the six photographers. A seventh tree was planted
in honor of all the other journalists killed in Vietnam.

   Salvage crews Sunday finished removing the
wreckage of a USAir jet from the East River so federal
investigators can examine the parts to see if mechanical problems
contributed to the crash.
   And Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci's office has
entered the investigation to be ``on the lookout for violations of
local laws,'' said Santucci spokesman Richard Piperno.
   A grand jury may be asked to investigate possible criminal
wrongdoing related to last week's crash of the Boeing 737-400 at
the end of a LaGuardia Airport runway that killed two passengers,
according to a source in the Queens district attorney's office.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said possible
charges included criminally negligent homicide and leaving the
scene of an accident.
   The pilot's licenses of the flight's captain and co-pilot were
suspended because they left the accident scene. The two also were
criticized by federal officials for failing to submit immediately
to drug and alcohol testing, although they are not legally required
to do so.
   A lawyer for the captain, Michael W. Martin, and co-pilot
Constantine Kleissas said Sunday that he saw ``no basis'' for a
grand jury.
   ``Based on everything I know, there is absolutely no criminal
act committed by either pilot and no wrongdoing by either of
them,'' said Frederick Hafetz.
   He declined to comment on whether his clients would cooperate
with a grand jury, should they be called to testify.
   He said they have been ``fully cooperative with the regulatory
authorities,'' but added that neither would make a public statement
in the near future.
   Although two people died late Wednesday on Flight 5050, headed
for Charlotte, N.C., 59 other passengers and crew members were
rescued from the East River and from the partially submerged
wreckage.
   National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz
said crews had the front and tail sections of the plane out of the
water Sunday afternoon. The main fuselage section was removed
later. The operation had been hampered by bad weather.
   The pieces were being trucked to an American Airlines hangar at
LaGuardia Airport, where investigators were waiting to examine
them, he said.
   James Kolstad, the NTSB's acting chairman, said at a news
conference Saturday that although the co-pilot inadvertently pushed
a button shutting off an automatic throttle, it was not known if
that was a factor in the plane's aborted takeoff and crash.
   Among other factors under investigation is the plane's
unexplained veer to the left during its takeoff, Kolstad said.
Investigators found skid marks on the runway from the plane's three
sets of wheels, he said.
   Lopatkiewicz said the jet's nose gear was recovered Sunday and,
``we're going to be looking at those tires very carefully.''
   Another critical question was whether the plane had reached a
speed known as V-1, the velocity _ based on a complicated
calculation involving numerous variables _ at which the takeoff may
no longer be safely aborted.
   Kleissas, 29, who had flown a 737-400 only once before on a
regular passenger flight, was at the controls, but Martin manually
took over the throttle when Kleissas pushed the button that turned
off the automatic throttle.
   Martin, 36, told investigators that he decided to abort the
takeoff after manually accelerating the jet because it began
drifting to the left and he felt and heard an unusual vibration.
   He believed he had enough room to stop the plane, but it instead
skidded off the runway, landing partially in the water and
partially atop a line of pilings, cracking the fuselage into three
sections.
   Martin and Kleissas submitted Friday to urinalysis but results
will not be available for three weeks, Kolstad said.
   On Saturday, they also gave urine samples to investigators from
the district attorney's office after they were told that a warrant
was being prepared.
   Piperno said that Martin ``didn't want anybody to see his face''
and had a blanket wrapped around his head when he met local
investigators at Jamaica Hospital.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said Sunday that the success of his meeting with the Soviet foreign
minister should silence congressional critics and dampen their
appetite for unilateral arms cuts.
   Despite progress on talks to cut strategic, conventional and
chemical weapons, Baker said the Soviet Union was still ``a
military threat.''
   ``I think it would quite naive for the United States to talk
about unilateral reductions of its strategic arsenal,'' Baker said
on the CBS-TV program ``Face the Nation.''
   The Bush administration, he said, remains committed to the
Strategic Defense Initiative and deploying new classes of
long-range bombers and mobile missiles.
   Baker's four-day session with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze yielded an agreement to hold a summit in the United
States next spring or summer.
   It will be the first meeting between President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev since Bush took office, although the
two met in New York between's Bush's election and his inauguration.
   Baker will meet twice with Shevardnadze to plan the summit, a
senior U.S. official said Sunday night as Baker flew to New York to
attend the U.N. General Assembly. The first session will be in the
Soviet Union in November or Decemeber, said the offical who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   He said if the two sides are unable to conclude a strategic
weapons reduction treaty by the time Bush and Gorbachev meet,
``certainly a summit will move it forward _ or should.''
   In the course of the Baker-Shevardnadze talks, the Soviets also
said they would withdraw a demand that the United States agree to
curb work on ``Star Wars'' before conclusion of a Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty (START).
   Baker told a news conference Saturday the Soviet decision could
speed conclusion of START, which would cut long-range strategic
arms by 30-to-50 percent.
   Taking on domestic critics Sunday, Baker said, ``There was a lot
of criticisms in advance of this ministerial (meeting) that I hope
is absolutely gone now because we have made some really fundamental
progress.''
   The most influential critic, Senator Majority Leader George
Mitchell, tempered his remarks somewhat on another interview
program, but did not recant.
   ``The events of the last 24 hours are certainly positive ... but
I still think there are a number of steps that should be taken,
should have been taken previously,'' the Maine Democrat said on
ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   He specifically mentioned the Democratic call for more financial
aid to Poland and expanded trade with the Soviet Union as areas
needing more attention.
   Baker and Shevardnadze went fishing Sunday morning in the Snake
River in the Rocky Mountains before flying separately to New York
for a United Nations meeting. Baker caught three trout, but
Shevardnadze caught nothing.
   Their mood appeared warm and friendly, as it has been since they
arrived in this beautiful mountain resort Thursday night.
   Despite progress in talks across a broad range of issues, and
the signing of six accords on Saturday, Baker said the Soviet Union
remained a threat.
   ``The military threat is not diminished if you look at (it) just
in terms of military to military,'' Baker said.
   He complained that while the Soviet Union has two classes of
mobile missiles, the SS-24 and the SS-25, the United States has yet
to deploy two it has under development, the rail-mobile MX and the
Midgetman.
   ``We have them on the drawing board and we still don't have
congressional approval even to move forward,'' he said.
   Mitchell was asked whether the United States can afford a mobile
missile system.
   ``Yes we can if we act prudently in other areas,'' the Senate
leader said. ``The important objective should not be a particular
type of weapon or defense system, but rather what enhances
strategic stability, what reduces the threat of nuclear war. Single
warhead mobile missiles do that.''
   Baker also urged Congress to approve Bush's full budget request
for Star Wars development.
   ``We still (are) every bit as committed to the Strategic Defense
Initiative as we were before,'' he said. ``Of course if the
Congress says, `You can't move forward,' then we will be
constrained from moving forward. And yes, they are making a heavy
run at the budget of S.D.I., much against the wishes of the Bush
administration.''
   Baker also disputed claims by some critics that the
administration does not really want a Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty.
   ``We want a START agreement,'' he insisted. ``We've said that
from the beginning of this administration. But we don't want a bad
one. ... We don't want one we can't get ratified.''
   That was a reference to a 1979 treaty signed by U.S. and Soviet
leaders but never ratified by the Senate.
   Baker had said Saturday he could not predict whether START would
be ready before next year's summit, but did not rule out such a
development.
   In an obviously coordinated display, the administration's top
three foreign policy officials appeared on television talk shows.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, questioned on NBC's
``Meet the Press,'' said the ``particular time'' set for the summit
meant there was a ``presumption'' of an agreement or major progress
toward one by then.
   Who yielded most in the Wyoming talks? ``I think it is clearly
the Soviet Union that has changed its position,'' said Scowcroft.
   But he said there are still details to be negotiated on the
Soviets' expressed willingness to sign a START treaty without U.S.
concessions on Star Wars.
   ``All we've got is the statement of delinkage ...,'' he said.
``Those issues are still opened but they will not have to be
required to be resolved before a START treaty.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on the ABC show, said: ``It would
appear that on the one hand they (the Soviets) are saying they
would be prepared to go forward and complete a START agreement even
if there was no limitation or agreement with respect to the space
defense talks. ... On the other hand they are still trying to tie
it in to their interpretation of the ABM treaty. And so I think it
would be fair to say we've made some progress here but we haven't
finally resolved these issues.''

   People across the country were donating money, goods, blood and
time to help victims of Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina, and
Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley Jr. on Sunday said the offerings were
heartwarming.
   Riley said the city was grateful for all the help it was
receiving as it struggles to recover from Hugo's destruction.
   ``We have received so many wonderful offerings of assistance,''
he said.
   The American Red Cross sought donations of blood and money and
brought in lunch wagons from around the country to help feed the
hungry.
   The Red Cross also had 208 shelters open in South Carolina on
Saturday night, housing 46,182 people, said Chris Chidley, Red
Cross spokesman in Columbia.
   Chidley said 40 people were waiting in line Sunday afternoon at
the American Red Cross headquarters in Columbia to donate blood.
   ``The response has been tremendous,'' he said.
   The Salvation Army brought in disaster assistance units from
Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana and was trying to
round up more from other areas.
   ``We think between our efforts and the Red Cross, we're going to
make a real difference,'' said John Edwards, spokesman for the
Salvation Army in the Carolinas.
   The Salvation Army opened a food distribution center in North
Charleston Sunday, and about 2,000 people waited in line, he said.
   About 200 University of South Carolina students and other
volunteers formed a human chain Sunday to pass donated goods into
the Carolina Coliseum.
   ``Some people who came to donate stuff have stayed to help,''
said Brad Smith, associate pastor of Spring Valley Presbyterian
Church and one of the organizers of the project. ``To see people
working together like this, it's exciting, it's beautiful.''
   Within five hours, a 10,000-square-foot room in the coliseum
that has ceilings about 12 feet high was packed with goods.
   The goods had to be sorted and a tractor-trailer was scheduled
to come Monday afternoon to take the first load of items to the
coast, Smith said.
   In Charleston, the Alabama State Baptist Convention opened a
mobile kitchen Sunday. People lined up all day in the rain, with
temperatures in the 60s.
   Emmette Jones of Montgomery, Ala., said the van would feed about
2,000 people in a day.

   Two legislators said Sunday that almost a third
of the Arabs killed by troops in the last six months of the
Palestinian uprising were children under age 16, and they demanded
a government inquiry.
   Also Sunday, underground Palestinian factions criticized an
Egyptian peace proposal but remained as divided over whether to
accept the 10-point plan.
   Meanwhile, an Israeli Cabinet minister suggested that Israelis
decide in a referendum on the Egyptian peace plan, which has deeply
divided the coalition government.
   In a letter sent to Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Justice
Minister Dan Meridor, the two legislators said 17 Palestinians aged
12 or less were shot to death and 31 youths between the ages of 12
and 16 were killed since April.
   The letter said the 48 children represented one-third of all
Palestinians killed over that period by soldiers.
   On Sunday, troops shot and killed Bassam Farouk el-Jabri, 18,
when they opened fire on stone-throwers in the Gaza Strip town of
Khan Yunis, hospital officials said. An army spokesman said the
military was investigating.
   The death raised to 574 the number of Palestinians killed by
soldiers or Israeli civilians during the 21-month uprising against
the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Forty
Israelis also have been slain.
   Also Sunday, soldiers shot and wounded 10 Palestinians in
stone-throwing clashes in the occupied lands, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The legislators, Yossi Sarid and Dedi Zucker, of the left-wing
Citizens Rights Movement demanded that Rabin and Meridor
investigate whether the killings are the result of new regulations
on firing weapons.
   In the last few weeks, Rabin liberalized the army's firing
orders, giving troops permission to shoot unarmed masked youth if
necessary to stop them. The youth are often members of underground
forces who kill suspected collaborators or enforce strikes.
   Also in Gaza, Palestinian assailants axed to death two men in
southern Rafah, one as an alleged drug dealer and the other as a
suspected collaborator with Israel, Arab reporters said.
   The army confirmed the deaths of Majid Mahmud El Nawaji, 30 and
Adel Abu Shaluf, who Arab reporters said was 38.
   The deaths raised to 119 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in connection with the uprising. Most have been slain
for allegedly cooperating with Israel, but some were killed by
Moslem fundamentalist groups as suspected drug dealers or
prostitutes.
   The pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprising
criticized the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's plan in a leaflet
distributed in the occupied territories, Israel Television and
radio reported.
   The leaflet did not reject the proposal, but it said the plan
could not be accepted until it included provisions for direct
participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization in talks and
the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
   A separate leaflet signed by the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine rejected the plan and called Mubarak ``an
agent of Washington and Tel Aviv.''
   The Mubarak plan advocates trading land for peace and calls for
a preparatory meeting between Israeli and Palestinian delegations
in Cairo as a prelude to negotiations.
   Egyptian ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny told a meeting of Israeli
peace activists in Tel Aviv on Sunday that the plan had PLO backing.
   ``Egypt will not agree to anything the PLO refuses, so we always
coordinate with the PLO,'' Bassiouny said on Israel radio.
   Interior Minister Arye Deri said Israel should hold a referendum
to answer the question: ``Do we want peace or not?''
   He told army radio such a vote would be a better idea than a
collapse of the coalition government of the Likud bloc and Labor
Party.
   ``I think that people understand that war or conflict cannot
persist forever,'' he said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc has
rejected the plan while the left-leaning Labor Party sees the plan
as a way of bridging Israeli and Palestinian positions.
   Deri's ultra-Orthodox Shas Party has six representatives in the
120-member parliament and helps hold the balance of power between
the left and right.

<HEAD>WWII Vets Plan Reunion, Want President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Survivors of President Bush's World
War II Navy squadron plan a reunion they hope will feature their
most famous flyboy.
   Bush's fellow veterans from torpedo squadron VT-51, who remember
him as a quiet, 20-year-old pilot, said they'd like him to join
their effort to reunite the group here next March.
   ``Just for old times' sake,'' said Leo Nadeau, Bush's gunner.
``The majority of us haven't seen each other in 45 years, but the
memories still linger on.''
   Bush did his torpedo bomber training at the Fort Lauderdale
naval air base for three months in 1943, and recently wrote a
handful of words for a magazine about that experience.
   ``I went off to Fort Lauderdale to learn to fly,'' Bush wrote in
the September issue of Life magazine. ``Training up and down the
East Coast, dropping ... dummy bombs and torpedoes. ... I had an
ensign's stripe and an admiral's confidence. I was a Navy pilot.''
   Some believe the president will show up at the reunion, which is
being held in conjunction with an air show, especially if they are
here to greet him.
   ``Obviously, I can't any more speak for the president than the
man on the moon, but it sounds like something he'd attend,'' said
Legare Hole, who flew with Bush.
   ``As a pilot, you could always depend on George,'' said Jack
Guy, who flew with Bush for two years. He, Butchart and a dozen
others from the squadron were invited to the president's
inauguration last year.
   ``Today, I think the bond between George and his crewmen and his
fellow combat pilots is very, very strong,'' Guy said. In fact, the
president often sends them notes, he said.
   Don Rhodes, a White House aide, said Bush may be drawn to the
reunion because the comrades who flew Grumman Avenger bombers with
him will be there.
   ``He enjoyed meeting those guys at the Blair House at the
inauguration,'' Rhodes said.
   But, he said, ``there just are not enough hours in the day and
he has to say no 99.9 percent of the time.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Appeal Of Demjanjuk's Lawyer's Attacker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's Supreme Court on Sunday rejected an
appeal by a 71-year-old Holocaust survivor jailed for hurling acid
into the face of the Israeli lawyer of convicted Nazi war criminal
John Demjanjuk, Army radio said.
   Yisrael Yehezkieli appealed to the court to reduce his
three-year sentence and cut the $11,000 compensation he was ordered
to pay Yoram Sheftel, the radio said. Sheftel was injured in the
eye in the attack.
   Sheftel represented John Demjanjuk, a 69-year-old Soviet-born
autoworker from Ohio sentenced to death in April 1988 for his role
as a Nazi guard. Prosecutors said he operated the gas chambers at
the Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland during World War
II.
   Demjanjuk said he was a victim of mistaken identity and appealed
the conviction and sentencing. The appeal is scheduled to be heard
before the Supreme Court in May 1990.
   The Supreme Court said it rejected Yehezkieli's appeal because
the attack was premeditated and caused bodily harm.
   Yehezkieli had argued the fine and sentence were excessive in
view of his advanced age and poverty.
   The acid attack occurred during the December funeral of another
Demjanjuk attorney, Dov Eitan, who committed suicide by throwing
himself out of a high-rise hotel in central Jerusalem.
   Yehezkieli, whose family was killed in Treblinka, was convicted
in March of aggravated assult.
   He attended most of the 14-month trial and was thrown out of the
courtroom several times for disrupting the proceedings.

<TEXT>
   About 2,500 labor union activists, many
dressed in camouflage gear, held a peaceful but emotional rally
Sunday outside Pittston Co. headquarters here in support of
striking coal miners.
   United Mine Workers' organizers said some striking miners and
supporters from seven Northeastern states gathered for the
four-hour rally to show their support for the five-month-old strike
against Pittston involving 1,700 miners in West Virginia and
Virginia.
   UMW president Richard L. Trumka stressed unity and nonviolence
in a speech before the demonstrators, who included members of the
AFL-CIO, United Auto Workers, Communication Workers of America and
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
   ``They want to separate us by geography. They want to separate
us by union label ... by the color of our skins, by our gender,
because they know that only by keeping the labor movement divided
can they win,'' Trumka said. ``We'll never again be divided.''
   Bill Casstevens, international secretary-treasurer for the
United Auto Workers, offered a pledge of solidarity. ``Your
struggle is our struggle. Your dreams are our dreams.''
   The activists from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Maine, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania marched from the
city's Sherman Baldwin Park about a mile to Pittston Co.
headquarters downtown.
   As the demonstrators walked, many of them wearing the camouflage
clothes the union has used to symbolize its hard-line stance, they
taunted the company saying, ``What's disgusting? Union busting.''
   Pittston offices in Greenwich and Virginia were closed Sunday,
and company officials could not be reached for comment.
   The rally was part of the union's effort to force a settlement
in the strike, which began April 5. The company wants to cut
benefits and raise wages, but the union has rejected any givebacks.

<TEXT>
   Albert A. Marks Jr., who brought the
Miss America Pageant to television, fired host Bert Parks and
dethroned Vanessa Williams over nude photos, died Sunday. He was 76.
   Marks died at Shore Memorial Hospital in Somers Point from
complications after a Sept. 11 heart attack, hospital spokesman
Bill Elliott said.
   Marks was identified so much with the pageant that he often was
referred to as Mr. Miss America.
   Just the day before suffering the heart attack at his Margate
home, he went to the Atlantic City Convention Center to greet
contestants and pageant staff and pose for photographs.
   While members of the ``pageant family'' knew him as a friend and
devout family man, Marks ran the national contest with an iron
will. He had final say on musical compositions, television
production plans, sponsorship contracts and choice of judges.
   Lawyer Leonard Horn, who became the pageant's first full-time,
paid director in 1987 after Marks retired from the job he had held
as a volunteer for 35 years, remembered Marks as a strong leader.
   ``He had a capacity for making quick decisions and never looking
back,'' said Horn.
   An investment broker by trade, Marks joined the Miss America
Pageant as an unpaid volunteer in 1952. Marks went on to become the
pageant's director and, for 25 years, its chairman. He brought the
show to television in 1954.
   He defended the pageant when it faced criticisms from feminists,
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
labor organizations and those who consider Miss America an outdated
symbol.
   Marks in the late 1960s suggested that the swimsuit contest be
scuttled and that contestants wear sports clothes instead. He said
he dropped his proposal because of a clamor from state pageant
committees, who did not like abandoning tradition.
   In January 1980, Marks decided not to renew the contract of Bert
Parks, who had been host since 1955. The firing brought
considerable criticism, including several nights of ridicule on the
air from talk-show host Johnny Carson.
   In 1982, he dropped the show's famous theme, ``There She Is,''
in a dispute with author Bernie Wayne. He allowed the song's return
in 1985.
   Miss Williams, the first black to wear the rhinestone-studded
crown, also became the first to be forced into giving it up when
Marks dismissed her in 1984 after nude photographs of her, taken
before her reign, were published in a men's magazine.
   Amid the controversies, Marks, senior vice president of the
investment banking firm Advest Group Inc., and past president of
the Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, racked up 11 ``Man of the
Year'' titles from civic organizations.
   Gary Collins, who co-hosted this year's show, said the pageant
owes a great debt to Marks.
   ``He was the reason that the pageant is still alive and
flourishing,'' Collins said in a telephone interview from
Mississippi. ``He kept the ideals of the pageant uppermost in his
mind.''
   Collins' wife, Miss America 1959 Mary Ann Mobley, said Marks
``weathered all the controversy that came up and the Miss America
Pageant got stronger. That's the mark of the man.''
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Kay. Funeral arrangements were
incomplete.

   A reformist bloc in the Soviet parliament adopted
a platform Sunday that calls for allowing ownership of private
property, prices set by market conditions and television free of
government control.
   The first platform of the 345 reform-minded deputies from the
Soviet parliament will be put beforethe 542-member Supreme Soviet,
which convenes a new legislative session on Monday.
   The reformist bloc _ members of the 2,250-member parliament _
also have drafted a bill that they say could lead to the formation
of non-Communist political parties.
   The platform places emphasis on new laws to guarantee human
rights. It includes the freedom to publish, to strike, and to move.
   Soviets currently must carry internal passports and obtain
permission to move into desired urban areas such as Moscow, and the
government still denies external passports to many citizens.
   Sergei Stankevich, a leader of the reformist bloc called the
Inter-Regional Group, said he and others have written a bill,
already approved by a subcommittee, that would guarantee the right
to form organizations. He said people could use this legal
protection to form non-Communist political parties.
   Stankevich warned that the proposal would face a ``sharp
discussion'' rather than sail easily through the legislature.
Elements of the bill also are included in the group's platform,
which was adopted overwhelmingly on Sunday.
   ``I don't think it will change our political conditions
immediately or drastically,'' he said.
   The platform of the reform coalition, which includes populist
Boris Yeltsin and human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, also calls
for eliminating a provision in the Soviet Constitution that defines
the Communist Party as the leading force in society.
   The group suggests substituting a phrase defining the
``soviets'' _ elected bodies from the level of city council to
national parliament _ as the only source of political power.
   The Supreme Soviet, or legislature, on Monday opens its second
session since the nation's first multi-candidate elections were
held last spring. In the opening session, deputies held the
nation's first confirmation hearings on Cabinet-level jobs and
forced the withdrawal of a number of candidates.
   However, deputies are only now organizing sufficiently to offer
their own bills to compete with those proposed by the Kremlin.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is to open the session with a
speech. Topping the enormous agenda of 80 reform bills is a package
aimed at easing the disastrous economic situation, which has
stripped store shelves nearly bare and left much of the nation
relying on ration coupons for key food items.
   The government plan calls for slashing the budget deficit from
120 billion rubles ($186 billion) to 60 billion rubles ($93
billion) and the leasing of many factories and much farmland to
individuals and groups.
   The Inter-Regional Group is calling for legalization of private
property, and the introduction of market pricing. Gorbachev's
advisers also have promoted letting supply and demand set prices.
But in the face of strong public objection to lifting government
subsidies, the government has promised to delay the proposal for
several years.
   The opposition group proposed that the vast industrial
ministries, which now control the supplies and decisions of most
factories in the country, should be replaced with small commissions
of experts in the field.
   The group also called for ``an end to the government monopoly on
television,'' a call reminiscent of last week's decision of the new
government in Poland to take control of its government television
away from the Communist Party.
   Several members of the Inter-Regional Group said their platform
included only a fraction of the critical reforms needed, but
historian Yuri Afansiev argued that they were adopting only their
first ``working paper'' setting the group's general orientation. He
said it would be refined and expanded later.

   Victims of Hurricane Hugo scrambled to
meet life's basic needs Sunday, fretting over shortages of food,
fresh water, cash and electricity. Unable to cook or boil water,
people stood for blocks waiting for hot meals.
   ``There's no bread, there's no meat,'' said Harold Washington,
21, at a supermarket that had doughnuts and peanut butter but
lacked staples. ``You can't survive like that. Things just aren't
working fast enough.''
   Washington, who lives with his mother and four siblings, said
the family was burning candles at night and washing clothes by
hand. They worried that the water they were using to brush their
teeth was contaminated.
   National Guardsmen with M-16 rifles patrolled the streets of the
battered city of 65,000 people, guarding against looters and
keeping order at locations where residents lugged coolers and
plastic jugs to get fresh water.
   By Sunday night, 27 people had been charged with looting in
Charleston, with all the arrests made before Sunday. About a dozen
others had been arrested for such offenses as disorderly conduct,
violating the curfew and petty larceny.
   An emergency law enacted Saturday night sought to keep
profiteers from charging $10 for a bag of ice and $600 for a chain
saw. Tempers flared at one location where people sought ice to keep
their food fresh.
   ``People were ... begging for ice,'' said Staff Sgt. Bill Petty
of the South Carolina National Guard. ``There were fistfights in
the line. They were down-on-the ground fights _ men and women.''
   Without electricity for a third day, residents were unable to
cook, boil water for drinking or get cash from bank machines. At
stores that managed to reopen Saturday, people waited in lines for
up to four hours.
   Full power was restored to all five downtown hospitals in
Charleston by Sunday night, according to officials with South
Carolina Electric and Gas Co. The hospitals had been using
generators.
   The Red Cross dished out hot meals from lunch wagons. At the
Citadel Square Baptist Church, the line stretched for three blocks,
spokesman Brian Ruberry said.
   Renildo Holmes dined on barbecued chicken, sweet corn and butter
beans from a mobile kitchen opened in Charleston by the Alabama
State Baptist Convention.
   ``I eat wherever I can get a meal,'' said Holmes, who had no
food at home. ``My neighborhood looks like a trash barrel.
Everything is out _ trees, light poles, cars overturned.''
   Wilma McDonald patched holes in her roof damaged by by fallen
pine trees, although water continued to drip. She was buoyed when
Allstate insurance adjuster Kent Robinson gave her a $500 check to
get the trees removed.
   ``You don't know how glad I am to see somebody,'' Mrs. McDonald
said. ``I was at my wit's end.''
   People rummaged through the chaos wrought by Hugo to find what
they had lost and what they could still salvage. Mostly, neighbors
did what they could to get by.
   Kenneth Watson, 34, of North Charleston, filled a bathtub with
water before Hugo hit, but he and 11 relatives have no power. On
Sunday, he bought groceries at a Piggly Wiggly supermarket even
though money is short.
   ``You can't get your checks and no banks are open. I just hope
something comes by,'' Watson said.
   If no relief comes, Watson said, ``I'll do it the old-time way
and go down to the river and fish and crab.''
   Officials said six branches of the South Carolina National Bank
would reopen Monday to ease the money shortage. The city also
planned to resume trash pickup Monday, officials said.
   As a cold rain fell Sunday morning, church bells pealed above
the hum of generators and the buzz of chain saws.
   ``We have no roof and we've got three feet of water in the
living room,'' said Jimmy Bailey, a state lawmaker who attended
services. ``But we all have what we were born with and that's good
health. ... Anything else is just gravy.''
   Hugo clobbered Charleston for six hours late Thursday and early
Friday with 135 mph winds and a storm surge of 17 feet of water. It
was among the 12 fiercest hurricanes to strike the United States in
this century, based on internal pressure, which gives winds their
strength, according to the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   Hugo was the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since
Hurricane Camille killed 256 people 20 years ago.
   The death toll from Hugo's six-day rampage stood at 51 _ at
least 27 people in the Caribbean and 24 in the Carolinas, Virginia
and New York. A South Carolina woman and her two children died
Sunday when their rural wood-frame house caught fire from candles,
officials said.
   Damage estimates were in the billions of dollars.
   In the three-county area around Charleston, 75,000 people were
still out of their homes, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said. Schools
are closed until further notice, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remains
in effect.
   ``It's scary out there,'' said National Guard Staff Sgt. James
Shugart after coming off night patrol. ``You don't know what to
expect. There are no lights. You don't see anything open.''
   At least 760,000 people in the Carolinas remained without power.
Sections of Charleston County may be groping without lights and
refrigerators for a month or more.
   In Charlotte, N.C., which is 200 miles inland, 135,000 of the
375,000 residents were without power and some could be without
electricity for two weeks.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin has asked for a federal disaster
declaration. The National Guard was sent to Charlotte on Saturday
to help the police.
   About 40 people, mostly from Mecklenburg County, spent the night
in shelters because they had no power or water. An undetermined
number stayed with relatives or checked into hotels.

   About 8,000 people staged an anti-abortion
rally at the New Jersey Statehouse on Sunday, cheering a litany of
speakers who warned lawmakers that the ``silent majority'' opposes
abortion.
   Thousands marched, chanted, prayed and sang as leaders urged
them to push for changes in the laws that legalized abortion.
   The throng was opposed by about 35 members of the National
Organization for Women, who held a silent counter-demonstration
behind a row of state police troopers. Police said there were no
incidents reported at the rally.
   Supports of abortion rights have a Statehouse rally set for Oct.
15.
   The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to allow state lawmakers
to restrict abortions has focused attention on the issue in New
Jersey and Virginia, the two states with gubernatorial elections
this year.
   Organizers of the rally, who are lobbying for an amendment to
the state Constitution to allow such restrictions, said they want
politicians to understand that voters are in their corner.
   ``There's a sleeping giant out there and it's about to awaken,''
said Kay Krug, president of Citizens Concerned for Life. ``It's
called the pro-life movement in New Jersey. Trenton, we're going to
amend the constitution and save babies in New Jersey.''
   Although about two dozen speakers urged the crowd to become
involved in the anti-abortion movement, few spoke specifically
about political candidates.
   The Republican candidate for governor, James Courter, a longtime
advocate of the anti-abortion movement, said during the Republican
gubernatorial primary he would sign a bill to restrict abortions.
Later, however, he said he would not impose his personal views on
the women of New Jersey.
   Democratic candidate James Florio says he favors a woman's right
to choose and would not sign any bill to restrict abortions in New
Jersey.

<TEXT>
   The ruling Sandinista party late
Sunday named President Daniel Ortega to head its slate of
candidates for next year's elections and picked Vice President
Sergio Ramirez as his running mate.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge introduced the nominations during
the daylong convention, and the 1,746 delegates approved the
choices by acclamation.
   Ortega, 44, who led the Sandinista National Liberation Front to
power with the 1979 overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza, had
been expected to win the nomination.
   He will run against the opposition coalition candidate, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the newspaper La Prensa, in Feb.
25 elections.
   There had been uncertainty as to who would take the No. 2 spot,
with reports that Ramirez, a 47-year-old lawyer and novelist,
wanted to retire from public life. Borge had been mentioned as a
candidate for the nomination.
   Earlier, the convention approved a 31-page platform promising,
among other things, better health care, economic growth and a
``respectful accord'' with the United States.
   The platform, bearing the title ``Everyting Will Be Better,''
was also approved by acclamation, point by point, as these were
read aloud by Bayardo Arce, coordinator of the front.
   The platform promises economic growth at an annual rate of 5
percent, a halving of the infant mortality of 60 deaths per 1,000
births, and expansion of free education.
   The Nicaraguan economy, damaged by war and a U.S. economic
boycott, has become one of the poorest in Latin America. An
estimated 24 percent of Nicaragua's population of 3.5 million
cannot read or write.
   The convention, representing a wide spectrum of society, also
was to choose 90 candidates for the National Assembly _ the
single-chamber parliament _ and mayors for 145 municipalities.
   President Daniel Ortega moved up the date for the current
elections in return for a regional agreement on Aug. 7 to disband
the U.S.-supported Contra rebels who have fought to topple his
government since 1981. The Contras are to be disbanded by the end
of the year.
   There were no surprises in the Sandinista platform, which
promises to continue the current move toward ``a firm and durable
peace that will cover equally all Nicaraguan families and that will
give us security and tranquility in the future.''
   The document says the Sandinista government also seeks a
``respectful accord with the government of the United States.''
   The United States has been considering how to aid the 14-party
opposition coalition, and the Sandinistas say they expect millions
of dollars to flow to its campaign.

   A full day of rain Sunday turned
streets into rivers _ 10 feet deep in places _ and caused two
deaths when panicked drivers turned their cars into ditches they
thought were roads.
   A total of 2.33 inches of rain fell on this North Florida city
Sunday, beginning early in the morning and not abating until late
in the afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.
   ``We've got streets flowing like rivers,'' said Steve Weintraub,
spokesman for the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. ``Some places have
been measured at up to 10 feet deep. It's worse in downtown and on
the west side of town.''
   More than 30 city blocks were covered with water, major
intersections and ramps off Interstate 10 leading into the area
have been closed.
   Neither of the drowning victims was immediately identified.
Authorities said it took more than an hour to retrieve the body of
one of the victims from a rain-swollen ditch.
   Matt Frankle, Jacksonville's Civil Defense director, said he
expected about 100 residents to spend the night at a shelter set up
at a high school gymnasium.
   The situation is not likely to improve, with forecasters
predicting an 80 percent chance of more rain and scattered
thunderstorms Monday.

   The debut edition of the St. Louis Sun, the
nation's newest newspaper, began rolling off the presses on time
Sunday night with a front page featuring a bright sun rising over
the Gateway Arch.
   There was a last-minute rush to finish the final few pages, but
editors made their 9 p.m. deadline and the printing presses began
about a half hour later, a Sun spokesman said.
   Editor-in-chief Ralph Ingersoll II said the newspaper contained
four significant exclusive stories, including two copyrighted
stories. The media was barred from the newspaper's printing plant.
   The Sun's deadline, more than three hours earlier than usual,
was required to print 200,000 newspapers to meet the expected heavy
demand from the curious and people looking to pick up collector's
item.
   ``We'll be able to sell every paper, guaranteed,'' said Robert
Jelenic, president of the St. Louis Sun Publishing Co.
   The newspaper industry has been closely watching the launch of
the Sun, which is owned by the New Jersey-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., and is trying to buck the trend of newspapers
merging or shutting down.
   ``This newspaper will be successful if it's relevant. That's our
No. 1 priority,'' said Ingersoll, who is also chairman and chief
executive officer of Ingersoll Publications.
   Ingersoll and other Sun officials plan to ``hawk'' newspapers on
the street in front of the Sun's downtown offices Monday morning to
herald the newspaper's debut.
   The tabloid newspaper, which Sun officials are calling a
``laptop'' paper, already has been well-received in the St. Louis
area, having attracted nearly twice as many subscribers as
expected, Sun executives said Sunday.
   About 55,000 copies of the newspaper were to have been delivered
to charter subscribers early Monday morning, although that number
could have been higher, said Sun Publisher Thomas Tallarico.
   ``We had to stop promising first-day delivery because we
couldn't process the deluge of orders in time,'' Tallarico said.
``People will still get Vol. I, Issue I, they may just have to wait
till Tuesday.''
   Tallarico said officials had originally hoped to have a
circulation of 30,000 by the end of its first month of publication.
   The mood in the newsroom seemed remarkably subdued as editors
and reporters, 20 of whom have been borrowed from other Ingersoll
newspapers, completed the finishing touches of the debut issue
Sunday.
   ``I really do feel like we're making history, but we have to be
cautious not to blow all our energy in one day,'' said Bill
Theobald, assistant metro editor. ``Because we have to do this all
over again tomorrow and again and again and again.''
   Much of the newspaper had been pre-planned and pre-packaged,
leaving only sports and a few news stories until Sunday evening,
said Managing Editor Peter O'Sullivan.
   ``In many ways I think the pressure will be greater tomorrow
because we've been working toward this issue for months. Tomorrow
we'll only have one day, just like it's supposed to be,''
O'Sullivan said.
   The new paper will compete with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
which also publishes in the morning and will be 111 years old in
December. The Post-Dispatch has been the only daily newspaper in
St. Louis since the St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded in October 1986.
   The Post-Dispatch now has a daily circulation of about 380,000
and a Sunday circulation of about 565,000, said publisher Nicholas
G. Penniman IV.

<HEAD>Ministers Fail to Reach Agreement on Oil Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers debating whether they can pump more
oil without dragging down prices failed to agree Sunday on how to
reach their goals, a top official said.
   Subroto, secretary general of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the officials would meet
privately before resuming a third round of formal talks Monday
evening.
   ``We are still deliberating about the best way to achieve (our)
goal,'' he said at a press conference at the Geneva hotel where
meetings were held Sunday.
   The ministers are thrashing out whether they can raise their
current production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day in the
final quarter of the year without weakening crude prices.
   Led by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, they have been
pumping about 22 million barrels a day _ well over their official
cap.
   Prices have been steady in recent months, but they are still
about $1 under the cartel's target of $18 a barrel.
   Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi said there were two or three
proposals on the ministers' bargaining table. He declined to
elaborate.
   ``It seems that the ceiling is the imminent problem,'' he told
reporters after the meeting.
   He said he favored an increase in the ceiling, with the extra
amount shared proportionately among all 13 members. Each would get
a certain amount added to its individual supply quota.
   However, Chalabi suggested the ministers would defer until
November any resolution of the sticky issue of fairly disbributing
production shares.
   Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates want bigger slices of the
output pie. To press their demands, they have been producing as
much as double their quotas of about 1 million barrels each.
   In June, some ministers indicated they would try to settle the
quota issue at this meeting. But it seemed Sunday that members were
now less willing to do so.
   Going into the weekend meetings, the ministers were divided over
what to do in the fourth quarter of the year.
   Some worry that lifting their production ceiling even a little
could cause prices to fall.
   Others are convinced demand is strong enough to absorb a
substantial boost in output.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh, whose country needs
petroleum revenue for reconstruction after its eight-year war with
Iraq, said, ``This situation is good. It's not very bad.'' He
apparently was referring to crude prices, which have held fairly
steady in recent months.
   However, some blame the gap between current prices and the
target on Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates pumping above their
limits.
   One faction argues the cheating has deprived their countries of
additional oil revenues. A rise in the ceiling to the actual daily
production of about 22 million barrels would cut into the
overproducers' volume and let all benefit from more sales, they say.
   The easiest option would be to roll over their current supply
cap of 19.5 million barrels a day for the rest of the year. But
that, some say, would be tantamount to approving the cheating.
   Algeria's Sadek Boussena, Libya's Fawzi Shakshuki and others
have expressed concern prices are not stronger. They would like to
keep the current ceiling. Iraq's Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi has
said he would like increased production, as Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates reportedly do.
   Subroto has predicted demand for the cartel's oil will reach 22
million barrels a day in the October-December period.
   There is no indication how long the current meeting will last.

   The World Bank may have been overoptimistic
about its plan to insure private investors in the Third World
against war and violence, Bank President Barber Conable said Sunday.
   The World Bank launched the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency, or MIGA, over a year ago, but it has yet to issue its first
policy.
   ``All of us hoped that these activities would have translated
into a few guarantee operations by the end of this fiscal year,''
Barber told a meeting called to explain its operations.
   ``We have learned the truth of the old Spanish proverb:
`Traveller: there is no path, the path is made by walking.' We have
been optimistic _overoptimistic, perhaps, and must face the fact
that negotiations with private investors must move slowly.
Approvals of bilateral arrangements by member governments require
considerable time and effort, particularly for such a new venture.''
   He said 53 of the bank's 152 governments have become members of
the new agency.
   Some governments dislike letting an outside organization decide
when events within the country have damaged a foreign investor,
since their own courts would not have the last word in disputed
cases.
   The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which insures
American investors, has run into the same problem. OPIC was working
in 72 countries last year, however, and made a record $135.3
million on its operations _ one of the few U.S. government agencies
to turn a profit.
   It has been hoped that some governments, reluctant to let an
agency from another government do the job, will tolerate the new
one because it is international.
   Investors who want to put about $375 million into 11 Third World
countries have asked for guarantees, the new agency announced
earlier this month. They came from Canada, Denmark, West Germany,
Italy, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Switzerland, Britain and the
United States.
   A spokesman, who insisted on anonymity, said the first policy
was due to be issued in the next few months.
   New investment in Third World countries dropped to $13 billion
from $25 billion between 1982 and 1987, the last year for which
figures are available. That meant fewer new jobs, less production,
smaller exports and more pressure for new grants and loans from
richer countries.
   ``All around the globe, nations that once perceived the private
sector as marginal, threatening, irrelevant or all of the above,
are giving their own entrepreneurs and partners from abroad new
latitude and encouragement,'' Conable said.
   He noted that business people dislike going where they are not
welcome.
   ``MIGA's protection against non-commercial risks will often be
the key that opens the door to foreign direct investment in
developing countries,'' he said.

<HEAD>Francois Michelin Remains as Durable as His Tires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Francois Michelin, whose company agreed Friday to
acquire the Ohio-based Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., has proven to be
as durable the radial tire his company introduced 43 years ago.
   For decades, Michelin has adhered to a style of management
marked by secrecy, thrift and an aversion to outside interference
such as that by government and unions.
   The company believes in technology, and invests about 5 percent
of profits in research and development. In 1946, it introduced the
radial tire and virtually transformed the industry. Drivers around
the world now buy radials for their superior handling qualities and
durablity.
   The company remains committed to only two activities: making
tires and producing guidebooks and maps for drivers who ride on
them.
   ``You will always need a spring between your bottom and the
road, and air will always be the cheapest spring,'' he told the
Financial Times in one of his very rare interviews.
   The secretive man's company assembles its own production
machines rather than let another firm see what equipment it is
using.
   ``It takes our engineers 10 years to put out a new tire or
develop a new machine,'' Michelin, 63, has said. ``But five minutes
is enough to understand the process and thus copy it and put our
employees out of work.''
   But the more than 20,000 Michelin employees who lost their jobs
in the mid-1980s did not have corporate espionage to blame. Rather,
the company was forced to scale back by a general recession in the
tire industry.
   The downturn could not have come at a worse time for Michelin,
one of the few big French enterprises to keep its headquarters in
the province where it was born.
   After capturing the lion's share of the European tire market,
the Clermont-Ferrand-based company decided in the 1970s to ``put
America on radials.'' It built five plants and a large test center
in the United States from 1978 and 1982, spending more than $3
billion. It also expanded operations into Canada and Brazil.
   The fast expansion followed by the sudden recession was further
complicated by a rise in interest rates and the dollar. Michelin
had borrowed heavily to finance the U.S. growth.
   But after several years of struggle, Michelin watched profits
soar in the first six months of 1989 to the equivalent of about
$250 million, up 28.1 percent from the first half of 1988.
   On Friday, Michelin offered to pay $690 million for Uniroyal and
assume $810 million in debt, officials of the Akron, Ohio-based
company said.
   The deal, if approved, will allow Michelin to overtake Goodyear
as the world's largest tire maker.
   Tall and slim with a piercing look, Francois Michelin is called
``Le Patron'' or The Boss by his staff, while the company founded
by his father is called simply ``La Maison,'' or The House.
   He is known for being suspicious of luxury. He dresses in worn
suits, travels in economy class and, when in Paris on business,
takes the subway.
   Trained in mathematics, his interests reportedly lean toward the
metaphysical and his politics to the conservative.
   It is Michelin's opinion that every French government since 1936
has conducted a ``socialistic policy.'' By promoting wealth
redistribution, he has said, the government has ``deprived people
of the responsiblity of their own fate.''

<HEAD>Prospectors Gain Access to Promising Mountain Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert gas prospectors in the remote
northern Oman hinterland have finally gained access to a promising
mountain area first noticed by legendary explorer Wilfred Thesiger
50 years ago, oil industry sources said Sunday.
   They said Petroleum Development Oman drillers next week will
attempt to establish a well on the summit of the 1,300-foot Jebel
Madmar near the oasis town of Adam, ancestral home of the Al
Bu-Said tribe from which Sultan Qaboos, ruler of Oman, is descended.
   One of the largest undrilled prospects left in Oman, Jebel
Madmar is described by Muscat-based geologists as a classic
hydrocarbon-trapping anticline and a promising discovery.
   Thesiger, the first European to penetrate the Oman desert and
live with its nomadic tribesmen, wrote about Jebel Madmar and the
neighbouring Jebel Salakh in his book ``Arabian Sands.'' He
described the mountains as dome-shaped formations ``regretfully''
associated with hydrocarbons by geologists.
   It took 50 years to follow up on his observation because the
prospect was virtually inaccessible and required modern road
construction technology, said the sources, who spoke on condition
they not be named.
   The cost of building the access road to the drilling location
has not been disclosed but was equivalent to the cost of drilling
an ordinary well, they said.
   Until now, Petroleum Development Oman has been concentrating on
targets beneath the desert thaet offer easier access for seismic
crews and rigs.
   A state-financed natural gas exploration program was launched in
Oman five years ago in a bid to save fuel oil.
   Reserves were estimated at 7 trillion cubic meters at the
beginning of 1988, the latest year for which figures are available.
   About $15 million was being invested in gas development projects
this year, according to a government spokesman.

<TEXT>
   Iran exported an average of 2 million
barrels of oil a day during recent months, Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh has said.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying that 90
percent of the oil was sold for cash rather than bartered for
goods, a development he called unprecedented since the 1979
revolution.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted Aqazadeh as giving the
export figure Saturday but it did not specify exactly how many
months he was referring to.
   Iran has an output quota of 2.78 million barrels a day set by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Iran's oil output during the eight-year Gulf war with Iraq
plunged below 1 million barrels a day at times. Both belligerents
targeted each other's oil industries in an effort to cut their
economic lifelines.
   The Iranian oil minister also said the war-devastated Abadan
refinery on the Gulf coast had been rebuilt at a cost of $40
million and its capacity has reached 130,000 barrels a day.
   Aqazadeh was quoted as saying imports of refined gasoline have
stopped because domestic refineries had been rebuilt, and the
government was considering lifting gasoline rationing.
   In addition to the recent ending of gasoline imports, only a
portion of the country's needs in kerosene and gas oil were being
imported, Aqazadeh said.
   Iran will stop importing these two items after the Arak and
Bandar Abbas refineries are put back into operation, he was quoted
as saying.

<HEAD>Lundberg Survey Notes Slight Rise in Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Gasoline prices rose nearly a third of a
penny over the past two weeks as retailers found they no longer
could absorb prices increases from wholesalers, a survey found.
   The overall national price of a gallon of gasoline, including
all grades of the fuel along with state and local taxes, rose 0.31
cents to $1.0943 cents a gallon for the week ended Sept. 22,
according to the Lundberg Survey.
   Trilby Lundberg, director of the biweekly price poll of about
12,000 service stations nationwide, said a competitive
end-of-summer market forced retailers to hold prices down, even
though wholesalers were making increases.
   ``Now the wholesale rises have been great enough so that now
retailers have been turning up their prices, on average,'' she
said. She forecast the trend would continue into the fall, ``but
its difficult to do during a time of decreased demand.''
   Average nationwide prices per gallon at self-service gasoline
pumps, which account for more than 80 percent of all sales, were at
98.25 cents for regular unleaded; $1.1531 for premium unleaded; and
97.22 cents for regular leaded, according to the survey.
   At full-serve stations the average prices were $1.2721 for
regular unleaded, $1.3967 for premium unleaded and $1.2619 for
regular leaded.

<HEAD>Kodak To Be Sole Sponsor of Time Special Issue on Photojournalism</HEAD>

   Time magazine plans to publish a special issue
on the history of photojournalism next month, and the photography
giant Eastman Kodak Co. will be the lone advertiser.
   Time's special issue, ``150 Years of Photojournalism,'' will
appear Oct. 23 and will be distributed as a bonus issue to the 4.3
million regular subscribers to the weekly newsmagazine. It also
will be available at newsstands for four weeks for $2.95.
   Though it will be the first Time issue with only one sponsor,
single-advertiser magazines are nothing new.
   Time's sister magazines Fortune and People, for instance, have
had single-sponsored issues and so has Time's chief competitor,
Newsweek.
   The financial services giant Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. was the
only advertiser in a 1987 Fortune issue that featured the year's
``most exciting business people.''
   In 1984, Ford Motor Co. was the lone advertiser in a People
special issue on entertainer Michael Jackson, while Apple Computer
Inc. was the sole sponsor of Newsweek's special election issue.
   Publishers often argue that limiting advertising in a given
issue of a magazine to only one sponsor gives the sponsor a better
chance at getting its sales message across to readers. They say it
eliminates the advertising clutter that can arise in
multi-sponsored magazines.
   But it is expensive to command the single-sponsor exclusivity.
And media critics say that single-sponsorship can prompt some
readers to raise questions about editorial independence.
   Brian Brown, a Time spokesman, said Time's editors conceived the
idea for the issue as a way to mark the 150th anniversary of the
birth of photography.
   He said after the magazine decided to proceed with the issue, it
approached Kodak to see if that company wanted to be the sole
sponsor. He said Kodak had no role in shaping the issue's editorial
content.
   Neither Time nor Kodak officials would disclose how much Kodak
was paying, other than to stay it was a multimillion-dollar package.
   Kodak gets 20 pages of advertising in the 80-page issue, which
will feature scores of what Time says are the most important news
photos ever printed.
   Daniel Matthaides, a spokesman for Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak,
said his company wanted to do something to mark the anniversary,
and felt that the Time issue would be popular with readers and that
the sole sponsorship would assert Kodak's leadership in the
photography field.
   The timing of the issue was also important, he said, because the
last three months of the year are normally a big sales season for
photographic products.
