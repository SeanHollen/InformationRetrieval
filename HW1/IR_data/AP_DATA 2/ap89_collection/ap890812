<TEXT>
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri, at the controls
of a crane wielding a wrecking ball, officially marked the end of
36 years of toll bridges in Jacksonville by helping demolish
several toll booths.
   After collecting some $370 million in tolls from 1.5 billion
motorists, the tolls were removed Friday from four local bridges
and a four-lane expressway.
   ``We have taken a quantum leap forward in improving the quality
of life for our city. Today is like New Year's, Christmas and the
Fourth of July rolled into one,'' Hazouri said at ceremonies at the
Mathews bridge, which opened in 1953.
   Moments earlier signs were unveiled on the Mathews Bridge toll
plazas reading, ``No Tolls, Pass Thru.''
   At the same time, the tolls also ended on the Fuller Warren,
Trout River, and Hart bridges and on Butler Boulevard, a four-lane
expressway linking Interstate 95 to the beach.
   There was a festive party atmosphere on the Mathews Bridge, with
crowds cheering, horns honking and the St. Johns River City Band
playing. Fireworks were ignited on Quarantine Island in the middle
of the St. Johns River.
   The mayor and Chester Stokes, chairman of the Jacksonville
Transportation Authority, climbed aboard a large yellow crane, and
with the help of a crane operator, toppled several toll booths.
   In a large front-page headline, The Florida Times-Union
proclaimed Friday, ``Un-tolled joy: KEEP THE CHANGE.''
   The removal of the tolls was made possible by the passage in
March 1988 of a half-cent city sales tax. In addition to removing
tolls on existing bridges, the new Dames Point Bridge opened
toll-free earlier this year.
   The removal of the tolls cames 18 months after the voters
approved the concept. The wait was necessary to convince state
officials that the sales tax revenue would generate sufficient
funds to cover the refinancing of $200 million in outstanding
toll-revenue bonds issued in 1963, 1977 and 1985.

<HEAD>Juror Is Dismissed For Sleeping In Night Stalker Deliberations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 13th day of jury deliberations in the
``Night Stalker'' trial was interrupted Friday when the judge
dismissed a juror for sleeping and ordered the panel to start all
over again.
   An alternate juror was chosen to replace the sleeping juror in
the complex case involving 13 murders and 30 felonies committed
during the summer of l985. Jurors heard six months of testimony
after six months of jury selection.
   Richard Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter from El Paso, Texas, is
accused of being the devil-worshipping ``Night Stalker'' who raped,
murdered and robbed victims in a rampage that terrified Southern
California.
   Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin said he and defense
lawyer Ray Clark were summoned Friday to the courtroom of Superior
Court Judge Michael Tynan after the jury foreman sent a note saying
that one juror had been seen sleeping at the deliberation table.
   Tynan interviewed the foreman who said two other jurors had
reported seeing the man in question nodding off and snoring in the
deliberation room.
   After a brief discussion with attorneys, Tynan summoned the
juror and told him he was being dismissed for sleeping. The juror
did not protest.
   The judge then brought the entire panel into the courtroom. He
told them not to speculate on why the juror was being dismissed and
instructed them to begin their talks anew with the alternate
filling the dismissed juror's place.
   Halpin said it was impossible to tell how long it would take now
for the jury to reach a unanimous decision on the 43 counts
involved.
   Earlier this week, the jury returned to the courtroom to ask for
a repeat of testimony involving Ramirez' dental problems. It was
the first time they had asked for testimony to be read back since
they began deliberating July 26.

<TEXT>
   A suspected crack dealer curious about
a police round-up called a 911 emergency number to ask if
authorities were looking for him. When he hung up, he had his
answer _ officers were at his door.
   Police said James Earl Mays, 33, of Forrest County telephoned
the police emergency line on Thursday night to ask about a report
he heard on the street _ a grand jury had indicted 101 people
suspected of dealing crack and police were looking for them.
   A computerized system flashed the address from which Mays was
telephoning, and officers sped to the house and arrested him, a
sheriff's office spokesman said.
   The indictments were issued Thursday, and by Friday afternoon
officers had arrested more than 50 people accused of selling crack
to undercover agents working with the Metro Narcotics Task Force.
   District Attorney Glenn White said arraignments would be held
Aug. 25. The investigation began early this year, authorities said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House, sifting through offers, hints
and statements from the Middle East about American hostages in
Lebanon, says the United States wants to ``let these issues play
out for a few days and see what happens.''
   ``We get a lot of different statements, some optimistic, some
pessimistic, some critical, some crazy,'' said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We watch them all, analyze them all and in a sense, the public
and (the press) all are seeing the process pretty much as it is.''
   The latest development was a conditional offer of assistance
from the spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah,
believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions holding most
of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, during a Friday prayer service
in Beirut, said he was ready to help free the hostages if the West
helps release Arab prisoners in Israel.
   Fitzwater and State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler,
using identical language at separate briefings, called it ``an
interesting statement.''
   ``They should release the hostages,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``You
don't need to talk about it. Just release the people who are held
against their will by Hezbollah. Any help which any party can
provide in the unconditional, safe and immediate release of the
hostages is welcome.''
   Fitzwater said the administration has not had any direct contact
with Hezbollah and isn't seeking any. Ms. Tutwiler reiterated the
administration position that it was willing to talk with anyone.
   Elaborating on his answer, Fitzwater said, ``We always said we'd
talk to anybody and seek any avenue for getting the release of the
hostages, but there's never really been an opportunity for direct
discussions'' with the hostage holders.
   ``Partly they haven't wanted to. We've said we won't negotiate
for hostages. It just hasn't been fruitful.''
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
expressed skepticism about Fadlallah's offer.
   ``This is the kind of thing we've seen him say on frequent
occasions, and he's never done anything,'' the official said.
   Fitzwater, describing that state of play after two weeks of
intense activity, said, ``It's a long process and we need to be
patient and let discussions flow back and forth.''
   He said President Bush has a sense of urgency on ``the overall
situation, but the most important traits right now are patience and
determination, to not let urgency push you to say things or do
things that would be counterproductive.''
   Insisting there were no new developments, Fitzwater said, ``We
would like to lower our voices a little and let these issues play
out for a few days and see what happens.''
   Fitzwater also played down the prospect of direct U.S. contacts
with Iran after saying a day earlier that the administration
expected there would eventually be talks with Tehran on the
hostages and communications through third parties.
   ``The whole question of direct contacts has gotten so far out of
proportion that I don't want to lend any credence to it,'' he said.
   ``We are having any number of contacts through any number of
channels ... but this direct-contacts business, I'm afraid, has
gotten you off track in terms of focusing on what's really
happening there,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``There's no miracle there (in direct talks with Iran). It's not
that big a deal. There's all kinds of contacts that can and will be
made _ that have to be made preparatory to direct (talks), and
there need never be direct contacts to solve many of these issues,
to change relationships and so forth.''
   Meanwhile, The New York Times reported today that Soviet and
U.S. officials said Moscow had sent messages to Iran, Syria and
Palestinian groups urgently appealing for release of the Western
hostages.
   ``The Soviet response has been constructive, helpful and
forthcoming,'' the newspaper quoted an administration official.
``It's less than we would like them to do, but more than they would
have done in the past.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Says Disclosure Hurt Bloch Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is hardening its
assessment of the damage done by public disclosure to its
investigation of suspected Soviet spy Felix S. Bloch.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said flatly Friday
that the July 21 disclosure that the 54-year-old U.S. diplomat was
under investigation had compromised the investigation.
   ``There is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case,
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation,
did compromise the investigation,'' Runkel said.
   He didn't explain how the investigation had been compromised.
However, Runkel's assessment was much stronger than one he
delivered July 31 when asked about the impact of unprecedented
publicity on an espionage investigation that so far has produced no
criminal charges.
   He said then that ``the premature disclosure may have had an
adverse impact on the development of new evidence in the case.''
   The investigation of Bloch, the No. 2 U.S. diplomat in Vienna
for much of the decade, was disclosed July 21 by ABC News.
   ``The differences in the statements reflects a different view,
based on how people in the department see the situation today,''
Runkel said Friday when asked about the contrast between his two
assessments.
   He acknowledged the Justice Department opposed the State
Department's decision to issue a statement after the ABC News
broadcast that essentially confirmed the accuracy of the report.
   The television report and a series of disclosures have produced
what Runkel called ``the circus going on out there'' of reporters
and FBI agents tailing Bloch each day on daily excursions from his
apartment.
   On Thursday, Runkel acknowledged the department doesn't have an
espionage case against Bloch, who was placed on paid leave by the
State Department.
   Asked why there were no charges despite continuous FBI
surveillance of Bloch, Runkel said: ``The department does not bring
charges unless it believes it has sufficient evidence to convince a
jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is guilty of violating
the law.''
   The FBI has been conducting a round-the-clock surveillance of
Bloch to prevent him from leaving the country while investigators
try to find evidence to charge him with espionage.
   Runkel refused to comment when asked if the department had
evidence that it was unwilling to disclose in court for fear of
hurting counterintelligence operations.
   Bloch, meantime, led reporters and photographers on a Friday
afternoon shopping excursion to a suburban supermarket.
   About 1 p.m., Bloch announced he was about to leave his
apartment. Two hours later, Bloch finally emerged, driving his
light-blue Mercedez-Benz. He invited two television crews to ride
along while he went on errands.
   Followed by a 20-car caravan of reporters, TV crews and FBI
agents, Bloch drove to a shopping center in nearby Bethesda, Md.,
where he shopped at a supermarket and a bookstore.
   The supermarket manager asked the TV crews to leave the store
after a cameraman who was backpeddling to film Bloch buying
groceries knocked over an elderly woman, who cut her hand on the
floor.

   The Guardian Angels intend to set up a subway
patrol in Paris despite opposition from local officials, one of the
group's leaders says.
   Lisa Sliwa completed a five-day tour of the subway system on
Friday and told reporters she would return in September to recruit
and train French Guardian Angels.
   ``We are really needed here,'' said Ms. Sliwa, who wore the red
beret and white T-shirt that the New York-based group has adopted
as a uniform.
   The Paris transit authority and police unions have said they
oppose a Guardian Angel patrol.
   ``We are completely opposed to those who act as a militia or
other police force,'' said a statement issued Monday by the transit
authority.
   Ms. Sliwa said she had since met with police and transit
authority officials and, while not getting their approval, plans to
go ahead with setting up a subway patrol. ``We are not a militia,''
she said.
   She said the Guardian Angels, founded in 1979, patrol subways in
44 American cities, as well as in London, Montreal and Toronto.

<HEAD>North Sentence Could Have Been Harsher Under Federal Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legal publication says Oliver North could
have been sentenced to more than 4{ years in prison if federal
sentencing guidelines had been applied to his Iran-Contra
conviction.
   However, the guidelines that recommend ranges of possible
sentences to judges weren't applied in the North case because they
cover only federal crimes committed after Nov. 1, 1987.
   The editors of the Federal Sentencing Reporter, a non-profit
publication circulated among federal judges, probation officers,
law professors and lawyers, concluded North could have been
sentenced under the guidelines to 21 to 57 months in prison.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of
Congress, destroying government documents and accepting an illegal
gratuity while working at the White House in 1986.
   He was fined, put on probation and ordered to do community
service _ but was sentenced to no jail time. North began his
community service work this week.
   The ranges ``sketch possible avenues guideline sentencing might
have taken,'' Marc Miller of Atlanta's Emory University Law School
and Daniel J. Freed of Yale University Law School said in their
analysis.
   If North's had been a guidelines case, U.S. District Court Judge
Gerhard Gesell still could have imposed no jail time but
prosecutors would have been able to appeal.
   Under the guidelines, ``there is a degree of flexibility, but
the challenge for the judge is to persuasively explain why there is
a substantial departure,'' Miller said Friday in an interview.
   ``When the appeals courts find the explanations unpersuasive,
they've reversed sentences.''
   The length of a recommended sentence under the guidelines in the
North case would depend partly on a judge deciding whether the
former White House aide substantially interfered with the
administration of justice.
   Other factors would be the value assigned to classified
documents that North destroyed, whether he was a major or minor
participant in the crime of aiding the obstruction of Congress and
whether he was considered to be in a high-level decision-making
capacity.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department, saying New York's
Shoreham nuclear power plant is ``safe, efficient and
much-needed,'' is joining in a lawsuit to prevent the plant from
being dismantled.
   The intervention in a state court came on behalf of the Energy
Department, which has strongly opposed the shutdown of the
813-megawatt plant on Long Island.
   W. Henson Moore, deputy energy secretary, said the state, in its
approval of the dismantling plan, had not adequately considered the
impact on the environment.
   The Justice Department argues that the New York Power Authority
and the state Public Service Commission should have prepared formal
environmental impact statements before approving the plan.
   The plant, Moore said, is ``safe, efficient and much-needed,''
adding that its closure would require the region to rely more
heavily on fossil fuel. Those fuels, he said, will have ``adverse
environmental consequences'' through the increased release of
chemicals that contribute to acid rain and global warming.
   Some Long Island residents and a group called Scientists and
Engineers for Secure Energy filed the suit against the plant.
   The Bush administration previously has made clear its opposition
to the closing of the $5.5 billion plant completed in 1985 and
licensed last year. It has yet to produce any commercial
electricity.
   State and local officials contend the plant should not be
allowed to operate because evacuation of the area 50 miles east of
New York City would be impossible.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo plans to meet with President Bush next
week to discuss White House opposition to the plant being torn down.

   Woodstock alumni John Sebastian, Bert
Sommer and Melanie will join Papa John Creech, former Byrds
guitarist Roger McGuinn and at least 10 other bands for a
``Remember Woodstock'' concert next week.
   The concert, billed as another three days of peace, love and
music in celebration of the Woodstock concert held 20 years ago, is
scheduled Aug. 17-19 in this Catskills Mountains resort town, said
promoter Elliott Schneider.
   Other acts scheduled are The Woodstock All-Star Band, Willie
Nininger and Family, Futu Futu, David Massengill, The Lisa Best
Blues Band, Cliff Eberhardt, The David Earle Johnson Latin Jazz
Band, Savoy Brown, and The Nichols Company Band, Schneider said
Friday.
   Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, Johnny Winter and the duo of Edgar Winter
and Leon Russell are also expected to play, and clown Wavey Gravy
will repeat his role as concert emcee on the first day of the
concert, the promoter said.
   State health officials approved the concert Thursday, saying
promoters had complied with all health requirements.
   Authorities rejected an earlier proposal for the concert, saying
it didn't adequately plan for congestion of traffic and people.
Promoters then limited the number of tickets to 4,000 _ a far cry
from the estimated 450,000 people who inundated the tiny town of
Bethel in August 1969.
   ``The local people are afraid that Woodstock is going to happen
all over again, so they want to make sure that it doesn't,''
Schneider said.

   Millionaire industrialist Victor Posner
has decided to build five 30-story condominium buildings on his
oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap.
   The Florida Department of Natural Resources had been trying
since March to persuade the Miami Beach executive to swap his 13
acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of state-owned land near
the Doral Country Club in Miami.
   The Posner tract, the city's only undeveloped oceanfront land,
is wedged between a strip of high-rises and would have made a
perfect setting for a park, state officials said.
   But Posner thought the swap would not have been profitable for
him, said his attorney, William J. Roberts.
   The Miami land, formerly owned by the Federal Aviation
Administration, is worth $8 million while Posner's land is worth
$15 million, state officials said.
   Roberts said Posner would proceed with plans to build the
condominiums with 1,500 units on the site. Posner faces one more
hurdle: state approval for two of the five buildings that would be
built near the ocean.

   San Francisco Giants pitcher Dave Dravecky,
who made a remarkable comeback from cancer surgery, also made a
pitch for a 6-year-old boy suffering from leukemia.
   Alex Vlahos of Hillsborough sat in the stands Thursday as his
friend tossed eight strong innings in his first major-league
appearance since surgery on his pitching arm 10 months ago.
   Dravecky won the game, 4-3. His pitching performance also helped
raise tens of thousands of dollars for Alex, who desperately needs
a bone marrow transplant to beat leukemia.
   Dravecky and radio station KNBR in San Francisco launched a fund
drive this week in an effort to find a bone marrow donor for Alex.
Listeners could pledge any amount on Dravecky's pitching
performance, with the money going to offset the $75 it costs to
screen each of the potential bone marrow donors.
   The response was overwhelming.
   It may be several days before KNBR knows how much was raised,
but the station said Thursday night that pledges finally came to
$500 to $1,000 for each Dravecky pitch _ totaling between $46,000
and $92,000.

   U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J.
Brennan Jr.'s name will remain on the Hudson County courthouse
despite protests by veterans who object to his opinion allowing the
burning of the American flag.
   The county Board of Freeholders on Thursday unanimously agreed
to name the 83-year-old building after Brennan, who served as
Hudson County's assignment judge from 1947 to 1951.
   Brennan authored the recent U.S. Supreme Court opinion that said
burning the American flag was protected by the Constitution.
   Ten veterans, wearing their military caps, attended the meeting,
and said they were upset over the vote.
   ``It's wrong,'' said Joseph Duffy, vice commander of American
Legion Post 52 in Jersey City. ``Anybody can burn the American flag
at this moment and nothing will be done to them.''

<HEAD>Withdrawals in Nation's S&amp;Ls Double</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says that net deposit
withdrawals at the nation's thrifts more than doubled in June _ to
$4.6 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, known as the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board until enactment of the new savings and loan law earlier
this week, attributed the outflow to intentional shrinkage by
thrifts as they prepared to meet the law's tough capital rule.
   ``Everybody knew about the legislation in June,'' James Barth,
OTS chief economist, said Friday. ``They knew it was just a matter
of time and they were doing the things they will have to do in
order to meet higher capital requirements.''
   About one in four of the nation's 2,933 S&amp;Ls don't meet the new
standard _ $1.50 in tangible capital for every $100 in lending _
that becomes effective in four months.
   The only way thrifts that can't attract new capital can comply
is to sell off assets such as loans and pay off liabilities such as
deposits.
   Barth said S&amp;Ls in June reduced their assets by a near-record
$7.6 billion, a monthly total exceeded only by the $8 billion
reduction in January.
   Most of the June reduction was accounted for by a record $5.1
billion drop in mortgage-backed securities, one of the most easily
sold assets in a thrift portfolio.
   The June deposit outflow was the 14th in a row. Although it was
more than twice the $2.1 billion drain in May, it was still far
below the $10.8 billion record set in January.
   For the first six months of the year, a net $40.3 billion have
flowed out of thrift accounts compared with an inflow of $11.8
billion in the first half of 1988.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Move to Reinstate Former Reagan Aide's Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors want a federal appeals court to
reconsider its decision to overturn the illegal lobbying conviction
against former White House aide Lyn Nofziger.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ``undermined critical
provisions of the Ethics in Government Act'' when it ruled June 27
that Nofziger's conviction must be set aside, prosecutors said in
court papers filed Friday.
   The office of independent counsel James McKay asked the court to
grant a rehearing before the three-member panel or set the case for
rehearing by all 10 members of the appeals court.
   Nofziger was convicted Feb. 11, 1988, on three counts of
lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients
shortly after he left the Reagan White House.
   Prosecutors say the lobbying violated a one-year ethics law ban
against lobbying former government colleagues.
   But the appeals panel, in a 2-1 ruling, said that to get a
conviction, prosecutors were required to show that Nofziger knew he
was lobbying his former colleagues on matters in which the White
House had a ``direct and substantial interest.''
   Prosecutors maintain the law required only that they show
Nofziger intended to influence the officials on those matters.
   One of Nofziger's lawyers, Lawrence Barcella, said the
prosecution arguments present ``absolutely nothing new'' and there
is ``no reason to disturb'' the appeals court decision.
   The lobbying Nofziger performed was for the scandal-plagued
Wedtech Corp., a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of
the Air Force's A-10 anti-tank plane.
   Nofziger, 65, was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined
$30,000.

   Two abortion protesters and a man who insisted
God told him to set fire to an abortion clinic conspired to violate
federal racketeering laws, a federal court jury ruled Friday in a
civil lawsuit.
   Curtis Beseda, already serving 20 years in a Texas federal
prison for setting fire to the Feminist Women's Health Center in
Everett, also violated the racketeering statute through arson and
extortion aimed at the abortion clinic, the jury concluded.
   The Everett clinic was burned three times between December 1983
and April 1984, then closed its doors. Beseda earlier told the jury
he had no intention of setting any fire until he heard God tell him
to do it.
   He and protesters Dottie Roberts and Sharon Codispoti, both of
Lake Stevens, were found to have conspired to violate the
racketeering statute.
   Beseda was ordered to pay $268,500 in civil damages while
Beseda, Roberts and Codispoti will share another $11,000 fine. All
damages can be trebled.
   Two other defendants, Bonnie and Michael Undseth of Snohomish,
were acquitted. Jurors in Judge Thomas Zilly's court deliberated 3{
days before reaching a verdict in the month-long trial.
   The lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute,
intended to fight organized crime, has been used against abortion
protesters.
   Damages will go to several clinic employees and to the Feminist
Women's Health Center of Yakima, parent clinic to the one that
burned.
   Roberts' lawyer Theresa Schrempp promised an appeal. Roberts,
holding her young grandson Timothy, said she thinks the jury was
confused by the complexity of the case, involving 52 pages of jury
instructions.
   ``It's a perversion of the First Amendment,'' she said. ``This
one's going to the Supreme Court.'' She said the plaintiffs ``won't
get anything out of me ... because I don't have anything.''
   In Philadelphia, the case that set precedent in the Seattle case
was upheld on appeal in March and defendants have asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to hear it.
   Twenty-six individuals were found guilty of multiple acts of
extortion at an abortion clinic there. The clinic was awarded
$100,000.
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged Beseda and the other
defendants conspired to shut down the clinic by arson, personal and
telephone harassment of patients and staff, blocking access to and
from the clinic, picketing and helping Beseda escape to Canada.
   A successful action under the racketeering statute must show an
enterprise adversely affects interstate commerce and engages in a
pattern of racketeering, meaning a serious violation of the law
such as arson, extortion, wire fraud, robbery, kidnapping or
murder, said Edmond Tiryak, the civil rights attorney who tried the
Philadelphia case.

<HEAD>Peugeot Shows Worst Injury Potential In Government Crash Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crash tests indicate that a driver of a
Peugeot 505S has a greater chance of head injury than drivers of 28
other cars and small trucks tested so far, federal engineers say.
   However, a Peugeot spokesman said the tests conducted by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration using
instrument-equipped dummies don't accurately test the effects of
real highway accidents.
   ``Our top concern is protecting human beings, not dummies,''
Pascal Henault, president of Peugeot Motors of America, said Friday.
   The new series of tests included 10 different car and van models
by U.S. and foreign automaker. In previous tests involving 19
vehicles, the Chevrolet Astro Van fared worst. The Astro now stands
second among cars tested for injuries in a 35-mile-per-hour
collision.
   The vehicles were tested under NHTSA's program to provide
consumers a guide to the safety of 1989 cars and small trucks.
   The car in which the lightest injury potential was recorded so
far is the Dodge Daytona, followed by the Ford Thunderbird and the
Audi 80. The Audi was among the 10 cars tested in the most recent
round. Others, in addition to the Peugeot 505S, were Volkswagen
Fox, Hyundai Sonata, Isuzu Trooper II, Suzuki Sidekick, and Toyota
Cressida, Corolla, pickup and van.
   After the latest tests were made public, Peugeot issued a news
release including comments from Henault and from four automotive
and consumer experts who criticized the government tests as
inaccurate measures of the varied circumstances that exist in real
crashes.
   ``Peugeot's commitment to building cars that are safe in the
real world cannot be overshadowed by these experimental crash-test
results,'' said Henault.
   The NHTSA tests consist of crashing a single model of each car
containing two crash dummies into a fixed barrier at 35 mph. The
stresses that result on the dummies are measured by sensors. The
artificial occupants are protected by seat belts and other safety
devices used in the cars.
   NHTSA engineers reported stresses on the head as an index called
the ``head injury criterion.'' The higher the index, the greater
the likelihood of injury.
   The Peugeot crash produced a head injury criterion of 1,983 on
the driver-side dummy. The earlier Astro test registered 1,849.
   Federal regulations require cars to produce a head injury
criterion no greater than 1,000 in tests conducted by the
automakers at 30 mph. The NHTSA tests are not considered comparable
because they are done at a speed 5 mph faster.
   The tests are continuing, but here is how all models so far
tested rank in head injury criterion to the driver:
   Peugeot 505S, 1,983; Chevrolet Astro Van, 1,849; Toyota Pickup,
1,520; Dodge Spirit, 1,421; Suzuki Sidekick, 1,345; Chevrolet
Caprice, 1,328; Suzuki Trooper II, 1,269; Toyota Van, 1,183;
Hyundai Sonata, 1,196; Toyota Corolla and Ford Bronco II, 994;
Mitsubishi Galant, 971; Ford Probe, 970; Jeep Cherokee, 968;
Mitsubishi Mirage, 960.
   Others were the Mercury Tracer, 940; Eagle Premier, 877; Lincoln
Continental, 863; Chevrolet S10 Blazer, 834; Mitsubishi Van, 805;
Toyota Cressida, 790; Volkswagen Fox, 787; Chrysler 5th Avenue,
786; Honda Civic CRX, 750; Eagle Medallion, 745; Plymouth Acclaim,
663; Audi 80, 600; Ford Thunderbird, 541; Dodge Daytona, 399.

<HEAD>FDA Revokes Two Generic Drug Approvals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is taking the
first formal action against generic drug companies being
investigated by the agency, revoking recent drug approvals of two
manufacturers.
   The revocations were issued Friday against Par Pharmaceutical
Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., and American Therapeutics Inc. of
Bohemia, N.Y.
   Both actions involved chlorozoxazone, the generic name for
Parafon Forte, a muscle relaxant made by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Par
received approval to market its version June 5 and ATI was granted
approval June 23.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the approvals were rescinded
because the reports on which they were based didn't include
``substantial deficiencies in manufacturing practices'' found
during a recent special inspection.
   The approvals were revoked Aug. 3, Nesbit said.
   Both companies disputed the legal ground on which FDA issued the
revocations.
   ``The agency just can't summarily rescind a new drug approval
without providing sponsor due process of law,'' said David Weeda, a
lawyer for ATI.
   He said the manufacturing problems cited by the FDA involved
``minor labeling and packaging deficiencies, which the company made
prompt corrective action.''
   ATI had not shipped its product when the approval was rescinded,
but Par had begun shipping, a spokeswoman said.
   ``It's not being shipped anymore, but it's not being recalled
either,'' said Par lawyer Barbara Manners. She said FDA hadn't
raised any questions about the safety of the product.
   Par and ATI are among 11 generic drug companies being
investigated by the FDA in the wake of allegations of fraud and
corruption in the generic drug industry.
   Par recently pleaded guilty to providing an improper gratuity to
an FDA employee. Par also has admitted giving the FDA false
information about one of its drugs, which it has recalled.

<NOTE>US Condemns Syrian Role In Beirut Fighting</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is taking the unusual
step of singling out Syria for its role in the latest round of
fighting in Beirut.
   The criticism came Friday as U.S. officials continued to seek
Syrian help to obtain the release of eight American hostages held
by pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon.
   ``We again call upon Syria, an active participant in the
fighting, the Lebanese armed forces, as well as the various
Lebanese factions, for an immediate cease-fire, the lifting of all
blockades and the initiation of a dialogue for the political
reconstruction of Lebanon,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   The State Department has generally refrained from singling out
the combatants by name, preferring to call for restraint by all
sides.
   The latest round of fighting in the five-month artillery war
over control of Beirut came Friday, when Syrian and Christian
gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers, killing six
people.
   U.S. policy toward Syria treads a delicate balance of criticism
of the Soviet-backed government for its support of Palestinian and
Shiite terrorism and seeking to enlist its support for the
Arab-Israeli peace process and other negotiations in the volatile
region.

<NOTE>No Evidence of Uncontrolled Chain Reaction: DOE</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says investigators found
no evidence that an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction occurred at
the Rocky Flats weapons plant near Denver.
   However, the department said Friday that plutonium was found in
situations that require ``immediate attention.'' The DOE did not
detail those situations or what would be done about them.
   Plutonium is the nuclear material recovered from weapons being
retired and reprocessed at Rocky Flats to make triggers for new
weapons. It is highly toxic.
   The question of a chain reaction arose after radioactive
isotopes of strontium and cesium, which don't occur in nature, were
found in groundwater near the plant. Some plant employees claimed
that conditions existed routinely that could lead to a chain
reaction.
   An uncontrolled chain reaction produces an explosion in a bomb
and a controlled reaction is the basis for nuclear power plants.
   Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and state
agencies said the strontium and cesium radioactivity was so low
that it was almost undetectable, and might have been the result of
fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s.
   Rocky Flats has been criticized for polluting the environment,
and the FBI has begun an investigation of past practices.

<NOTE>One Pentagon Official Sworn In; Another Resigns</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Ford Motor Co. executive John Betti,
sworn in as the Pentagon's undersecretary of defense for
acquisition, says there will be a ``fundamental change'' in the way
the Defense Department spends its money.
   Betti has been put in charge of streamlining the agency's $150
billion-a-year purchasing bureaucracy.
   ``A fundamental change is required if we are to optimize the
overall acquisition process and provide the highest quality
products and services to the men and women in the field _ on time
and on cost,'' Betti said in a statement Friday.
   Betti had worked for Ford since 1962, most recently as executive
vice president for Ford's diversified products operation.
   Also Friday, Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr. stepped down from
his Pentagon job after serving the longest term of any such service
secretary in the nation's history _ 8 years, 6 months and 15 days.
   He will be succeeded by Michael Stone, undersecretary of the
Army.
   However, Marsh will be back at the Pentagon on Monday as an
adviser to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   In February, Marsh broke the record for longevity set by Thomas
Jefferson's secretary of war, Henry Dearborn, who served from 1801
to 1809, according to figures provided by the Army's office of
public affairs.

<HEAD>Strike In Gdansk, Soviet Ambassador Meets Communists, Moscow Warnings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Poles stopped work for an
hour in a Solidarity-organized strike, while the Soviet ambassador
met with Communist leaders and officials in Moscow spoke against
upheaval in Poland.
   It was the first Soviet government comment on the parliamentary
maneuvering in which Solidarity is trying to form a non-Communist
government to lead the Soviet Union's largest East bloc ally.
   The independent Solidarity trade union movement staged the
strike in Gdansk province to demand more pay and an end to
Communist Party influence on management.
   Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov held an unusual series of
meetings in Warsaw on Friday, including sessions with the chairmen
of the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party. The parties
traditionally have been allied with the Communists, but Solidarity
is courting them to form a government.
   According to the Polish government's PAP news agency, the party
leaders and the Soviet ambassador met to discuss starting ``direct
cooperation'' with the Soviet Communist Party and to review reforms
in both countries.
   PAP said Brovikov met also with Prime Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak, who is trying to assemble a Communist-dominated Cabinet.
   Since neither Solidarity nor the Communists have a majority in
parliament, support from the Peasants and Democrats is crucial for
both sides' efforts to form a government.
   A Soviet official in Moscow, quoted by the official Tass news
agency, hinted that Solidarity's attempts to shut the Communists
out of a coalition government could hurt stability in Europe.
   The unidentified official did not mention Solidarity by name but
criticized ``attempts to use the process of forming the Polish
government for destabilizing the situation in the country.''
   Vadim Perfiliev, Soviet Foreign Ministry first deputy, was
quoted as telling a news conference that any acts that threaten
Poland's treaty obligations, ``including those under the Warsaw
Treaty and on Soviet-Polish cooperation, would not promote the
interests of stability in Europe.''
   Forming a new government was Poland's affair, Perfiliev said,
but added that the hoped a ``balanced approach'' would prevail,
according to Tass.
   The general strike in Gdansk province by bus drivers,
shipbuilders, dockhands and factory workers was Solidarity's first
since regaining legal status in April. Bogdan Borusewicz, an
organizer, described it as ``exceptionally'' successful.
   Solidarity said more than 200,000 workers participated and many
signed up to join the union, which has grown slowly since
legalization.
   ``Even those enterprises where Solidarity is weak went on
strike,'' Borusewicz said.
   Solidarity's regional council for Gdansk province estimated more
than 90 percent of the 500 enterprises in which it had members took
part in the strike.
   Organizers said it encompassed Gdansk, Sopot and Gdynia along
the Baltic Coast and inland towns. The province has 1.5 million
people.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, addressing workers in Gdynia,
referred to parliament's election of Kiszczak as prime minister
Aug. 2, and said: ``Let's not allow the monopoly of generals to be
reborn.''
   The opposition newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza said reports were
circulating that the opposition was proposing Walesa for prime
minister. Barbara Madajczyk-Krasowska, a Solidarity spokeswoman,
said Walesa made no comment on that report Friday.
   The strike, announced by wailing sirens and whistles at noon,
idled the Northern and Repair shipyards in Gdansk, the Paris
Commune shipyard in Gdynia and all ports in both cities, Solidarity
said.
   Buses and streetcars stopped running, and factories displayed
banners to show they were participating.
   Solidarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard, supported the
demands but did not strike. Workers said they did not want to risk
upsetting a tentative deal under which American philanthropist
Barbara Piasecka-Johnson would invest in the state-owned yard to
save it from bankruptcy.
   The official trade union federation OPZZ said its unions
approved of Solidarity's economic demands and it supported the
protest.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics in this working-class city have
never been pretty, and it is not surprising this summer's three-way
mayoral race has turned downright ugly.
   Mayor James Griffin has been called ``a six-pack politician.''
State Assemblyman William Hoyt was dubbed a ``silk-stocking
liberal.'' And, former chief city judge Wilbur Trammell cannot
shake the tag of being a spoiler.
   When the candidates aren't calling each other names, they have
some choice words for the reporters who cover them. Griffin said
Monday that 90 percent of the city's journalists were dishonest and
he advised them all to ``mind their own business.''
   Things began to turn nasty last week when Trammell confirmed he
was circulating petitions to qualify himself for an independent
line in the Nov. 7 general election. The move was interpreted to
mean that even if he lost the Sept. 11 Democratic primary, he would
stay in the race.
   ``Nobody controls me,'' Trammell said.
   Aides to Hoyt, who has the Democratic Party's endorsement,
blasted Trammell for being a spoiler.
   Griffin, a registered Democrat running with the Republican Party
endorsement for his fourth, four-year term as mayor, has benefited
in past campaigns from having the Democratic vote split among two
or more challengers. Polls indicate the same thing may happen this
year.
   In an emotional rebuttal of allegations that he was in the race
to help keep Griffin in office, Trammell said, ``No six-pack mayor
or silk-stocking liberal is going to defeat (me) no matter what
they try.''
   During a major snow storm that hit Buffalo in 1985, Griffin
advised residents to stay in their homes and relax with a six-pack
of beer.
   In addition, Trammell charged that Hoyt ``is in bed with Jimmy
Griffin, a bigot from day one.'' Griffin and Hoyt are white;
Trammell is black.
   Hoyt, in turn, claims that Trammell has ``zero chance'' of
winning the primary and should get out of the race. If Trammell
quit, Hoyt said his polls show that he would have enough support to
beat Griffin in a head-to-head matchup either in the primary or the
general election.
   Griffin ridiculed Hoyt for having paid $50,000 to a pollster
``just to tell him he's losing.'' Added the mayor at a news
conference, ``I could have told him that.''
   The mayor brushed aside reports that except for his monthly news
conference, he has avoided both his opponents and the media.
   The mayor said that if reporters want to cover him on the
campaign trail they should follow him around. He admitted he hasn't
been making his campaign schedule available, but said he might on
request.

<HEAD>D.C. Offers Money For Tips on Murders</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 5th graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Informants with tips leading to the arrest of
murder suspects will be paid up to $10,000 under a program that
District of Columbia police hope will slow a record homicide rate.
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood, holding his first news conference
Friday, said the new reward system is based on an existing program
that pays anonymous individuals up to $1,000 for information that
leads to convictions in robbery, theft and assault cases.
   At the same time, Mayor Marion Barry said a new police overtime
plan to help slow the pace of killings probably will be scrapped
because it is too expensive.
   Fulwood said the more lucrative reward system was needed because
many district residents have become intimidated by drug-related
violence and were afraid to speak up.
   ``There is a tolerance of this. What you have to do, Washington
D.C., is get up off your ass, if you'll pardon the expression, and
call us,'' said Fulwood who, along with Barry, unveiled a poster
with photographs of 18 murder suspects.
   Later Friday, police discovered one of the suspects is already
in the city jail.
   Police have made arrests in 181 murder cases this year, Fulwood
said. Through Friday, 274 persons had been killed in the nation's
capital this year, compared with 191 at the same time last year. In
1988, a record 372 persons were killed in Washington; police blame
more than 60 percent of these slayings on drugs.
   The program is Fulwood's second attempt in a week to slow the
city's record homicide rate, which increased sharply several weeks
ago.
   On Monday, Fulwood announced that officers working between 3
p.m. and 11 p.m. _ traditionally the period of highest crime _ will
now work until 3 a.m. to help stop the murders.
   However, Barry said after the press conference that the new
overtime program likely will be abandoned because it costs too much.
   Police spokesman Lt. Reginald Smith said the new overtime
concept will be reviewed next week, and he added that cost will be
one of the factors considered.

lives on, though only about 3,500 of them are left on the road. The
car has a certain mystique that draws many Edsel owners to
gatherings such as the 21st annual meeting of the International
Edsel Club, a four-day affair that ends today.
   The club, which claims 1,500 members, holds parts auctions,
exhibitions and awards banquets at its annual gathering, which also
provides a chance for the Edsel owners to get together and talk
about their passion _ the car whose name for many is synonymous
with failure.
   ``We're proud of our Edsels,'' said Morris Ferguson, who brought
his white 1959 model from Memphis, Tenn., for the meeting. ``We
talk about the love and labor we put into them.''
   Because of the car's lack of success during its time, jokesters
enjoy taking the Edsel and its owners for a ride.
   ``I think they're jealous,'' said Richard Watson, an Edsel owner
from Canton, Ill.
   Ford launched the gadgety Edsel on Sept. 4, 1957, with an
unprecedented marketing blitz. Ford lost about $450 million, and
the car was discontinued by 1960. But it has since become the stuff
of legends.
   There have been different theories as to why the Edsel bombed.
Some say it was a combination of a reaction against the hype, a
recession in the auto industry at the time and the car's unusual
``horse collar'' grill.
   ``I love the design of it now. It was way before its time,''
said Ferguson.
   Mike Sica of Port Jefferson, N.Y., who drove his white '59 model
to Atlanta, said the meetings provide a chance for Edsel owners to
swap or bid to buy parts for their cars.
   He said his Edsel gets him lots of attention, both for its
unusual looks and its frequent breakdowns.
   ``It's embarrassing when they break down, and they do that a
lot. But all old cars do that,'' said Sica, an electrician. ``When
you break down and pull over on the side of the road, everybody
ribs you.''
   Bob Hanson of Mableton, Ga., who helped organize this year's
club meeting, said the scarcity of spare parts is a problem for
Edsel owners.
   ``Edsels are difficult to restore,'' he said. ``It's not like a
Mustang or a Corvette, where you can buy parts over the counter.
Most (Edsel) parts were destroyed because Ford was so distraught
over the failure.''
   Many of the Edsel owners say their classics are for special
purposes only. They work on them as a hobby and take them out for
shows.
   But Ray Daumiller ('59, yellow) of Columbus, N.C., said his
Edsel is his main car. He takes it to the shows but also uses it to
go grocery shopping.
   ``It's a wonderful car,'' he said. ``Kind of stupid and ugly
looking, though.''

<HEAD>Ring Arcs Added to Voyager 2 Discoveries as Spacecraft Nears Neptune</HEAD>

   Voyager 2, now 12 days from its close
encounter with Neptune, has made another discovery that thrilled
scientists: two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar system's
fourth-largest planet.
   ``There is a mood of total elation here,'' said astronomer Rich
Terrile, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're really just ecstatic. ... Everything
we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.''
   Early Friday, Voyager 2 photographed the two partial rings,
called ``ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the
complete rings that encircle Saturn, Uranus and Jupiter.
   Since early July, Voyager has discovered four small moons
orbiting Neptune in addition to the previously known moons, Nereid
and Triton.
   The probe also has discovered 2,700-mile-wide dark bands _
possibly jet stream-like belts of windblown clouds _ forming a
collar around Neptune's south pole and possibly its north pole.
Voyager 2 earlier revealed a 6,200-mile-wide dark spot in the
planet's atmosphere, probably a giant storm like Jupiter's Great
Red Spot.
   Today, Voyager 2, traveling at 42,198 mph, was 2.72 billion
miles from Earth and 11.3 million miles from Neptune, the fourth
largest planet of the solar system and eighth planet from the sun.
   On Aug. 24, Voyager 2 is expected to fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's cloudtops. The probe was launched in 1977, and explored
Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus in 1986.
   One of the two ring arcs detected Friday extends one-eighth of
the distance around Neptune's equator, and the other only
one-thirty-sixth around the planet. That makes them about 30,000
miles and 6,000 miles long, respectively, NASA said. Terrile said
they may prove longer upon closer examination.
   ``Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of
debris associated with nearby moons, or may be remnants of moons
that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions,'' NASA
said.
   Scientists don't yet know if the ring arcs are made up of dust,
pebbles or boulders, or if the debris consists primarily of rock or
ice, said University of Arizona planetary scientist Brad Smith, who
heads the team analyzing photographs taken by the spacecraft.
   Researchers also don't know if the two partial rings found by
Voyager are among the three to six ring arcs that scientists
previously believed they detected from Earth, but ``it would be
surprising if they weren't,'' he added.
   Voyager project scientist Edward Stone has said Voyager may
discover 50 to 100 partial rings orbiting Neptune.
   ``Astronomers have long suspected the existence of ... an
irregular ring system around Neptune,'' NASA said. ``Voyager's
photographs of the rings arcs are the first photographic evidence
that such a ring system exists.''
   The three to six previously suspected ring arcs were detected by
telescopes on Earth as Neptune passed in front of a distant star.
   Saturn's extensive rings are made mostly of marble-sized ice
pebbles, while Uranus' rings contain very dark boulders of unknown
composition, Smith said. Jupiter is encircled by a single thin ring
and a sheet of fine dust, while Saturn has some ring arcs in
addition to its rings, Terrile said
   Why does Neptune have partial rather than complete rings?
   ``That's the $64,000 question,'' Terrile said. ``Rings come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, all the way from complete disks of
material like we've seen at Saturn, to narrow thin complete
ringlets like we've seen at Uranus. ... We believe the
gravitational influence of moons that orbit nearby give rings their
particular form.''
   Voyager 2 detected the 30,000-mile-long arc just outside the
orbit of one of the newly discovered moons, designated 1989 N4,
which orbits about 23,300 miles above Neptune. The 6,000-mile long
arc seems to trail about 50,000 miles behind moon 1989 N3, which
orbits about 17,000 miles above Neptune's cloudtops, NASA said.

   Rock star Bruce Springsteen, watching Ringo
Starr and his band at a performance, gave the audience a treat by
jumping on stage and playing alongside the former Beatles drummer.
   Springsteen, who made his name playing small venues on the
Jersey shore, joined Starr on Friday at the Garden State Arts
Center for the concert's final four songs, beginning with the
Beatles classic ``Get Back.''
   Starr is on a 30-city U.S. tour which began in Dallas on July 23
and closes in Los Angeles on Sept. 4. Among those accompanying him
are two members of Springsteen's E Street Band, saxophonist
Clarence Clemens and guitarist Nils Lofgren.
   Springsteen joined the band in ``Have Some Fun Tonight,''
Starr's early solo hit ``Photograph,'' and the finale, the Beatles'
``With A Little Help From My Friends.''
   Also joining the band for the finale was comedian John Candy,
who clowned and played the tambourine.

<BYLINE>Women Run High Depression and Misdiagnosis Risk, Committee Says
^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women run about twice the risk of men of
becoming depressed, and it is misdiagnosed in them up to half the
time, a new report said.
   Cultural factors are a major reason for the higher incidence,
and a tendency of physicians to interpret depressive symptoms as
physical illness causes misdiagnosis, said Ellen McGrath, head of
the group that drafted the report.
   Findings of the American Psychological Association National Task
Force on Women and Depression were discussed Friday at the
association's annual meeting.
   The task force examined several studies, which have consistently
found that women run twice the risk of depression as men, McGrath
said.
   The ``average'' woman runs about a 25 percent chance of major
depression, and the risk jumps to 51 percent for female physicians
and 37 percent for female psychologists, McGrath said.
   One reason for the high rates is biology, since women run about
a 50 percent chance of mild mood disturbance premenstrually and a
50 percent to 80 percent of mild depression after giving birth, she
said.
   Women who take birth control pills also run a heightened risk of
depression, she said.
   Another reason is what McGrath called a surprisingly high
incidence of violence against women. Research suggests 37 percent
of women have experienced sexual or physical abuse before age 21,
and some estimates run higher than 50 percent, she said.
   Such abuse can lead to prolonged depression in adult women, she
said.
   Women are taught to be passive and dependent, contributing to
their depression risk, she said.
   Calling poverty a ``pathway to depression,'' she said 75 percent
of the nation's poor are women and children.
   Some 71 percent of women have had a significant instance of
sexual harassment on the job, she said.
   Several studies suggest a misdiagnosis rate of 30 percent to 50
percent in women, she said.
   The problem appears because depressed women often seek help by
telling obstetricians, family doctors or internal medicine
specialists that they feel poorly or are tired, McGrath said.
   The physicians frequently approach it as a medical problem and
try to treat it that way, which does not work, she said.
   McGrath said she did not know how frequently male depressives
are misdiagnosed.
   Stephen Scheiber, a psychiatry professor at Northwestern
University, said in a telephone interview that a 50 percent
misdiagnosis estimate ``sounds high.''
   ``Certainly we all know it happens,'' he said, but he knew of no
study of rates of misdiagnosing depression.
   Physicians learn about depression as part of their training, he
said. But he also noted that federal mental health officials are
encouraging family physicians and specialists to recognize
depression in their patients.
   Scheiber also said the doubled rate of depression for women in
comparison to men showed up in a recent study of five communities.
While not a nationally representative sample, the work provides the
best available estimate of depression rates, he said.

<HEAD>Troops Again Detain U.S. Soldiers; Noriega Blasts Plebiscite Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian troops briefly detained American
soldiers in another confrontation between both sides, and Gen.
Manuel Noriega again indicated he has no intention of stepping down
as Panama's leader.
   Noriega today marked six years as head of the Panamanian Defense
Forces and the nation's de facto ruler.
   He said Friday that a plebiscite proposed by the opposition for
Aug. 20 on whether he should resign was tantamount to turning
Panama into ``a colony that accepts arrogance, vassalage and
indignity.''
   He spoke during a parade of thousands of troops and paramilitary
civilian units ending a 10-day exercise called ``Zap the Intruder.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington on
Friday that the Bush administration ``would not rule out'' seizing
Noriega and taking him to Florida to face drug trafficking charges.
But Fitzwater said Bush was not contemplating such a move at this
time.
   The latest confrontation between Panamanian and U.S. troops
occurred in a remote area known as Curundu near the Panama Canal.
The U.S. Southern Command says the area is a military zone shared
by both countries, while the Panamanians claim it is exclusively
their domain.
   A Defense Forces patrol detained four vehicles carrying a number
of U.S. military police, and the Southern Command said it quickly
dispatched troops backed by armored cars and helicopters.
   The incident started when ``American troops went around in
civilian clothes, with their weapons, riding in private vehicles in
violation'' of the Panama Canal treaties, said Panamanian Maj.
Carlos Saldana.
   ``No country in the world can accept that units, claiming to be
part of an army, move in within its territory armed and in civilian
clothes,'' he said. ``If they tried to do this in any other nation
they would be killed like common muggers, like a vulgar thief.''
   The confrontation ended after a meeting between Panamanian and
American military officers, a Southern Command news release said.
   The command called the detentions ``unjustified.'
   ``The vehicles were freed after U.S. military officers discussed
the situation with officers of the Defense Forces,'' said a news
release issued by the command.
   Neither the Panamanians nor the Americans said how many U.S.
military police or what kind of vehicles were involved.
   Similar incidents in recent weeks coincided with Southern
Command exercises and there have been arrests on both sides.
Earlier this week, American troops blockaded Fort Amador, which
contains U.S. and Panamanian military facilities.
   U.S. officials insist they have the right to conduct exercises
under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties to assure canal security.
Noriega, however, accuses the United States of seeking to abrogate
the treaties and keep the canal, which is to be turned over to
Panama at the end of 1999.
   The United States has been trying to pressure Noriega to quit as
head of the military since two federal grand juries in Florida
indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in
February 1988. However, tactics that have included economic and
trade sanctions have failed to budge Noriega.
   Guillermo Endara, the opposition leader who proposed holding the
plebiscite on Noriega's rule, responded a few hours after Noriega's
rejection Friday by calling the leader a dictator. Endara also
accused Noriega of subservience to the United States.
   ``We never were and never will be employees of the CIA, while he
himself was one,'' Endara said in an interview.
   International observers say the opposition won the May 7
presidential election by a landslide. Noriega's regime annulled the
balloting a few days later, saying there had been vote fraud.

<HEAD>Bloch Says He Was In Paris In May, Leaves Open Spying Question</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suspended U.S. diplomat Felix Bloch said
he was in Paris the day he allegedly left a briefcase in a
restaurant for a Soviet agent, but he declined to confirm or deny
spying allegations against him.
   Bloch spoke in an Austrian television and radio interview
broadcast Friday from Washington.
   It was the second time in the past week that he declined
opportunities in interviews with Austrian media to deny the
suspicions.
   The Austrian-born diplomat, formerly the No. 2 man in Vienna's
U.S. Embassy, was suspended from the State Department on June 22.
   In Washington, the Justice Department Friday said public
disclosure of its investigation of Bloch, 54, had compromised the
government's ability to obtain evidence against him.
   ``There is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case,
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation,
did compromise the investigation,'' department spokesman David
Runkel said without elaboration.
   No charges have been brought against Bloch. He remains under
investigation and surveillance by the FBI, and reporters have
followed him around Washington in recent days.
   ABC News has reported that on May 14, Bloch arrived in Paris
from New York and met his alleged contact for dinner. Bloch left
his briefcase under the table to be picked up by the suspected
Soviet agent, ABC said.
   Asked by Austrian TV correspondent Robert Wiesner whether he was
in Paris May 14, Bloch said after a long pause, ``Yes.''
   He declined, however, to specify whether he met Reino Gikman, a
man holding Finnish documents who regularly visited Vienna during
Bloch's 1980-87 tour in the Austrian capital. Gikman has been
identified by Austrian and U.S. authorities as a suspected KGB
agent who might have been a contact man.
   U.S. sources have said Bloch contends he only knew the man as a
stamp collector.
   When Wiesner pressed Bloch for details of the Paris trip, Bloch
said, ``I was in Paris May 14. I was in a restaurant, and there
were very many people in that restaurant, and I enjoyed the food
there very much.''
   ``Have you missed your briefcase since?'' asked Wiesner. After
another long pause, Bloch, who seemed relaxed and spoke in his
native German, said: ``No.''
   Wiesner repeatedly pressed Bloch to deny he was a spy.
   ``Why don't you just say it was all just invented?'' he asked.
   ``I could say much on this topic, but I will restrain myself,''
Bloch answered.
   By remaining silent, Wiesner noted, Bloch only heightens
suspense. ``I don't want people to feel bored during August,''
Bloch said, smiling.
   ``Are the accusations against you justified?'' Wiesner asked
again several minutes later. ``This question I cannot answer now,''
Bloch responded.
   In a much briefer interview in the current issue of the Austrian
weekly Profil, Bloch was similarly elusive. Asked why he did not
say straight out he is not a spy, he replied: ``There are
accusations, there is no proof. My guilt must be proved.''
   Bloch first accepted an invitation to visit the Washington
offices of Austria's state-run television 10 days ago, but declined
then to be interviewed.
   Wiesner said the second visit on Thursday began with Bloch
viewing cassettes of Vienna. The two chatted about Viennese
cemeteries, and then Bloch agreed to answer questions, he said.

<DATELINE>LOVELAND, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two foundries and a willingness to
support public art has turned the ``Sweetheart City,'' long known
as the town with the special Valentine's Day postmark, into a haven
for sculptors.
   ``Art is in focus all the time here,'' said sculptor Fritz
White, 59, who moved to Loveland in 1978 from Cincinnati. ``We've
infiltrated the Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, all kinds of
groups.''
   About 40 professional sculptors have moved to the northern
Colorado city, most of them in the past five years, and dozens of
others come to town part of the year to work with Loveland's two
foundries.
   Loveland is smitten with sculpture, displaying its own
collection along roadsides, at a sculpture park, around a new Civic
Center, and in galleries and studios around town.
   This weekend, the city is the site of one of the largest
sculpture shows in the world, Sculpture in the Park. Nearly 190
sculptors from around the nation are exhibiting work, and officials
hope the show will net the city even more than the $3.5 million it
did last year.
   Susan Hallsten McGarry, editor of Houston-based Southwest Art
magazine, called both the town and the huge sculpture show, ``a
pretty major force.... as to an actual art event that changes every
year with different people bringing new work, I don't think you can
get a broader exposure to a larger number of working sculptors
anywhere in the United States.''
   The city about 40 miles north of Denver that has struggled to
become known for something more than a place to get a special
Valentine's Day postal cancellation began its love affair with
sculpture back in 1972. Then, a local metal foundry that made parts
for General Motors began casting bronze for sculptures and soon was
accepting work from artists around the region.
   Eventually, it drew the artists themselves to Loveland, giving
many of them jobs in the business.
   A second foundry, Loveland Sculpture Works, was started by
former employees of the original foundry, Art Castings of Colorado.
   Five sculptors who had come to Loveland to be near the foundry _
George Lundeen, Dan Ostermiller, George Walbye, White and Hollis
Williford _ approached the city several years ago about helping
promote the arts.
   The result was the private Loveland High Plains Arts Council,
which raises money to buy works and then donates them to the city.
   The city does its part as well. In 1985, Loveland became the
first Colorado city to pass an ordinance setting aside 1 percent of
the construction costs of any public project over $50,000 to buy
original artwork.
   Susan Ison, director of the city's Visual Arts Commission, said
Loveland now has more than $1 million worth of art.
   In return, the influx of artists breathes new life into the
city's economy and cultural life.
   ``It's an industry in itself,'' City Manager Mike Rock said of
sculpture, which employs more than 400 people in the community of
38,200.
   Rock said Loveland's commitment to the arts has helped economic
development efforts.
   ``We can demonstrate to a company that it's a fairly
sophisticated community _ it has hometown values but an unmatched
level of art, and many community-minded citizens,'' he said.
   Downtown merchants, too, are sponsoring a sculpture park on a
prime corner to help attract more people.
   For the artists, that kind of attention and camaraderie make
Loveland an attractive place.
   White Williford moved to Loveland from Denver nine years ago to
be ``in the foundry's hip pocket.''
   Above all, Williford said, he likes the cooperative atmosphere
among Loveland sculptors.
   ``In a large city, it's more dog-eat-dog. People are less
willing to share. There's too many rats in a cage. When artists
back East come visit and we open our doors to them, they can't
believe it.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Settle Drought Lawsuit as Jury Rules In Favor Of Farmers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of farmers who were originally
denied drought insurance payments will split nearly $5 million in
compensation under an out-of-court settlement.
   As lawyers agreed to the deal, a U.S. District Court jury
awarded the farmers $40 million in damages. But the settlement
reached out of the courtroom will stand.
   In all, the farmers and Chubb Group, which joined them in their
lawsuit against Good Weather International Corp., agreed to settle
the suit for $8 million, the amount of the agent's liability
insurance.
   The farmers will collect $4.93 million and the Chubb Group of
insurance companies will collect $3.07 million. The verdict came on
the jury's second day of deliberations.
   ``We're very excited. It's further proof that the farmers had
really been taken advantage of,'' said Stanley Chesley, lawyer for
the farmers.
   Chesley said the farmers _ 8,800 in 10 states _ should be
receiving their money in about one week. He said a court-appointed
lawyer will determine the amount farmers will receive.
   Chubb, of Warren, N.J., paid $53 million to settle farmers'
claims against it, then joined the farmers' lawsuit against Good
Weather, suing to demand $77 million in damages.
   The farmers and Chubb claimed Good Weather sold more 1988
drought insurance than Chubb authorized.
   But Good Weather, based in Syosset, N.Y., maintained that Chubb
encouraged it to continue selling policies.
   The jury ruled that the company misrepresented the drought
insurance availability to the farmers. The jury also ruled that
Chubb failed to prove its cross-claims against Good Weather and did
not award anything to Chubb.
   The jury reached its verdict Friday afternoon as lawyers were in
another room at the federal courthouse working out a settlement.
   U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin had sealed the verdict until he
had a chance to confer with the lawyers.
   The farmers sued Good Weather for $20 million plus punitive
damages. The lawsuit represents farmers from Ohio, Illinois, Iowa,
Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri and
Wisconsin.
   Good Weather's lawyer, James Moore, said Chubb was responsible
for the drought policies because the insurer encouraged Good
Weather to sell more insurance than the amount authorized in the
firms' written contract.
   After the verdict, Moore went immediately to his office and was
unavailable for comment.
   James Ringer, Chubb's lawyer, said his company was pleased with
the settlement.

<TEXT>
   The Pacific coast whistle-stop train that
derailed and killed 112 people carried many would-be illegal aliens
who had planned to slip into the United States to find work.
   A bridge weakened by floods and torrential rain collapsed
Wednesday, pitching the train into the swirling San Rafael River 15
miles southeast of Guasave in northern Mexico.
   Survivor Cirilio Hernandez Lopez said Friday he had hoped to
cross the boarder into California to escape subsistence farming in
Etla la Villa in the southern state of Oaxaca.
   He traveled to the Sonora state beach resort of Mazatlan, and
from there took the train for the 700-mile ride to Mexicali, across
the border from Calexico, Calif.
   It would have been his first attempt to find work in the United
States.
   ``From growing corn and beans and burning oak to sell as
charcoal, I don't make anything, just enough to eat,'' said
Hernandez, 40, a Mexican of Indian descent who spoke Spanish with
difficulty.
   Hernandez said his youngest son, 16 years old, has finished
junior high school but may not be able to study further.
   ``I don't have the money for him to go to school. That's why I
was going to look for a way to earn a living,'' Hernandez said in
an interview at the Social Security Inistitute Hospital, where he
was recovering from injuries.
   He said he hoped to be released today and then would decide
whether to continue his trip to the United States.
   Sinaloa state health coordinator Humberto Gomez Campana said of
the more than 200 injured in the train derailment, 10 remained
hospitalized.
   About 400 people and four helicopters have been searching for
more victims, state security coordinator Jose Carlos de Saracho
said.
   Saracho said no more bodies were found Friday, but that the
search was to resume early today.
   Another would-be illegal alien, Benito Silva, said the $5 a day
he earned working at a taco stand in Mexico City was not enough to
feed his wife and four children and keep the eldest, a 9-year-old,
in school.
   ``I was going to cross the border. That was my intention,'' he
said.
   But the train crash left him with a leg fracture that will
require surgery, and doctors told him he would not be able to work
for at least three months.
   Many people on the train also were en route to visit relatives
or just completing summer vacations.
   People who still had not heard from relatives on the train
continued to arrive in Guasava on Friday, making the rounds of
government offices and hospitals.
   Officials buried 38 unidentified bodies in the Guasave cemetary,
their plots marked by white, nameless crosses. With the burials,
relatives had to try to identify the missing from photographs of
the bodies.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a
$75,000 fine against the Philadelphia Electric Co. for failing to
show adequate preparation for emergencies at two nuclear units.
   ``The inspectors found that on four of the five rotating crew
shifts the shift superintendents were unable to effectively use a
classification scheme for emergency severities for certain
fast-breaking severe accidents,'' the NRC said Friday in a
statement.
   The NRC also cited a lack of aggressive management to correct
the deficiencies at the utility's Limerick reactors.
   The utility said it would not appeal the fine.
   Limerick's Unit 1 reactor is at full power. Unit 2 started on
low power Friday afternoon, while the utility hopes to restart Unit
3 in October.

<TEXT>
   An anti-abortion protester promised to appeal a
jury's finding that she and two other activists conspired to shut
down an abortion clinic that was the target of several arson fires
before closing its doors.
   ``It's a perversion of the First Amendment,'' Dottie Roberts
said after the jury ruled she violated federal racketeering laws
and owed civil damages to the clinic operators. ``This one's going
to the Supreme Court.''
   The jury ruled Friday that Curtis Beseda, serving 20 years in a
Texas federal prison for setting fire to the Feminist Women's
Health Center in Everett, violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations statute through arson and extortion directed at the
clinic.
   Beseda, Roberts, 53, and Sharon Codispoti conspired to violate
the statute, the jury also found.
   Beseda, who told the jury earlier in the month-long trial that
he had no intention of setting any fire until he heard God tell him
to do it, was ordered to pay $268,500 in civil damages. Beseda,
Roberts and Codispoti will share another $11,000 fine, as well as
the clinic's legal expenses and court costs.
   All damages can be trebled under the RICO statute. The
plaintiffs had sought $560,029.
   Two other defendants, Bonnie and Michael Undseth of Snohomish,
were acquitted.
   ``I know that I didn't do anything wrong,'' said Codispoti, of
Lake Stevens. ``At this point I'm taking my strength from that.
   ``If I had to to it all over again, I'd still go out and picket
the abortion clinic.''
   The lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute,
established to fight organized crime, has been used against
abortion protesters.
   Damages will go to several clinic employees and to the Feminist
Women's Health Center of Yakima, parent clinic to the one that
burned.
   ``I'm delighted,'' said William J. Bender, lawyer for the
clinic, who said he found the decision ``fundamentally important.''
   ``It should be a clear message to anyone'' who protests abortion
clinics in the future, he said.
   Lawyer Theresa Schrempp, representing Roberts, promised an
appeal. She said she could not understand how there could be a
conspiracy if jurors did not find her client had actually violated
the racketeering act.
   To win under the racketeering statute, one must show that an
enterprise adversely affected interstate commerce and constituted a
pattern of illegal acts such as arson, extortion, wire fraud,
robbery, kidnapping or murder, said Edmond Tiryak, the civil rights
attorney who tried a recent precedent-setting case in Philadelphia.
   There, 26 individuals were found to have committed multiple acts
of extortion at an abortion clinic. The clinic was awarded $100,000.
   The Philadelphia case was upheld on appeal in March and
defendants have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear it.
   The Everett clinic was burned three times between December 1983
and April 1984, then closed its doors.
   ``A conspiracy is so hard to prove,'' said Diane Hale, a
director of the former clinic. ``I think it's really wonderful that
we were able to do it and the jury believed us. If we could do it,
other people could do it, too. This is a way they can protect
themselves.''

<HEAD>Southern Pacific Agrees to Pay $1.2 Million in Indian Land Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A railroad company will pay an Indian tribe
$1.2 million to end a century-old dispute over reservation land
acquired in the 1860s when the industry steamed its way West.
   ``As far as the railroad is concerned, we've settled with the
Indians and we're out of it,'' Nathan Jenkins, an attorney for the
Southern Pacific Transportation Co., said Friday. ``How the money
is distributed is up to the government and the tribe.
   Representatives for the Walker River Paiute tribe could not be
reached by telephone for comment on the trespassing case.
   U.S. District Court Judge Howard McKibben on Wednesday signed an
order approving the $1.2 million settlement, which will be held by
the court until officials decide how to distribute the money.
   Jenkins said the class-action lawsuit potentially involves from
300 to 500 Walker River Paiutes who could get a share of the
settlement.
   The tribe initially sought as much as $16 million, while the
railroad said the disputed land was worth only about $750 when
Southern Pacific acquired it. The railroad at first offered a
$30,000 settlement in the case.
   The dispute involves about 400 acres in west-central Nevada from
Wabuska in Lyon County to near the northern end of the Walker River
in Mineral County.
   The tribe filed suit in 1972 because the railroad never
officially gained congressional approval for a right of way through
the Walker River Indian Reservation to lay out its tracks.
   The Indians said that as a result, Southern Pacific was
trespassing and the tribe should be compensated for the use of the
land that rightfully should belong to the Paiutes.
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco agreed with
the Indians that the railroad failed to comply with several federal
acts governing tribal lands. The appeals court last year remanded
the case to the district level to award trespassing damages to the
tribe.
   More than 100 year ago, the Indians agreed to take $750 for the
land along with the promise from Southern Pacific for free rides to
Indians forever.
   The railroad agreed, but never built passenger cars for the
trains that ran on the line, which carried mostly explosives for
area military operations and other goods.
   As a result, Indians were forced to ride in boxcars or cattle
cars or on top of the trains, sometimes falling off, according to
old newspaper clippings.
   ``Members of the tribe were basically treated like cattle,''
says Edgar Cook, Kansas City, Mo., economist who studied the
history of the line for the U.S. Justice Department.

   A custodian has been declared the winner of a $3
million Lotto jackpot even though he has no winning ticket to show
for it.
   Sixty-year-old Julius Russell Jr. claimed he lost the ticket.
Circuit Judge Robert Sklodowski believed him, and ordered the
Illinois State Lottery to make him a millionaire.
   ``Russell provided evidence that he consistantly played the same
two sets of numbers on a weekly basis, and the lottery verified
that the winning ticket was purchased at the store where Russell
said he always bought his tickets,'' said Sklodowski in making the
ruling Thursday.
   Guy Lahr, an attorney for the lottery, said the 60-year-old
Russell did show officials other tickets with the winning numbers,
but all are dated after the Nov. 9, 1985, drawing, Lahr said.
   Sharon Sharp, lottery director, said the state hasn't decided
whether to appeal the ruling.
   The lottery no longer has the $3 million, which has been turned
over to the state. If the ruling stands, the lottery may have to
ask for a special appropriation, Ms. Sharp said.
   Russell played the same numbers each week _ 4-14-16-29-37-41 _
said Peter Andjelkovich, Russell's attorney.
   Andjelkovich said Russell didn't find out he had won until a
year after the drawing, when Russell's daughter, Julie, recognized
the winning number in a newspaper article that said no one had yet
claimed the $3 million Lotto prize.
   ``Russell screamed `Oh my God!' and started digging through his
lottery tickets,'' Andjelkovich said. ``But he couldn't find it.''
   Russell and 22 other people filed claims with the lottery for
the prize.
   All were rejected because none had the actual ticket, Ms. Sharp
said.

   Searchers continued to look for a
5-year-old girl who police suspect was one of three children thrown
off a bridge by their mother.
   The mother, Regina Moss Monroe, was found Friday evening near
the edge of the Tombigbee River about half a mile from the bridge,
authorities said.
   ``She was sitting down in the water,'' Lt. Charles Burge said
Friday.
   The bodies of two of the children, James Jr., 3, and his sister,
Jessica, who would have turned 4 next week, were pulled from the
river earlier Friday.
   Burge said Mrs. Monroe has not been charged but is considered a
suspect in the children's deaths. He said Mrs. Monroe, who was
bruised and cut, was taken to Riverside Medical Center for
treatment. Police suspect she jumped into the river after throwing
the children off the bridge.
   Officials at the hospital declined to release her condition.
   Mrs. Monroe was found by searchers Friday sitting in shallow
water near the riverbank about half a mile from the Joe
McCorquodale Bridge where her car, its motor still running and
front doors open, was found Thursday night.
   The bodies of James Jr. and Jessica were sent to the state
forensics lab in Mobile for autopsies. Their sister, Alicia, is
still missing.
   Mrs. Monroe's husband, James Monroe Sr., had alerted police
after he came out of a store in the southern Alabama community at
about 11 p.m. Thursday and found the car with his wife and three
children gone.
   Monroe flagged down a passing police car and told the officer
that his wife had apparently driven off with their children, Burge
said. Monroe, 31, told police that his wife had been a patient in a
mental hospital, Burge said.
   The car was found on the bridge about an hour later.

<HEAD>Hezbollah's Spiritual Leader Calls For Deal With West On Exchange
Of Captives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The spiritual leader of the reputed
umbrella group for kidnappers offered to help free foreign hostages
if Western powers secure the release of Arabs jailed in Israel.
   ``Let us get to an agreement together so that each side would
use his own means and influence to end the crisis of the hostages,
all hostages, and resolve the problem of Arab prisoners,'' Sheik
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said Friday.
   Fadlallah, who advises the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, spoke at the
Bir el-Abed mosque in the Shiite Moslem slums of south Beirut
during Ashoura ceremonies commemorating the most revered Shiite
saint, Imam Hussein bin Ali, grandson of the prophet Mohammed.
   Shiites held Ashoura parades Friday, trampling Israeli and
American flags inscribed ``Death to Israel, Death to America.''
   Eight Americans and eight other Western hostages are held in
Lebanon, most of them by radical Shiite groups believed associated
with Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God.
   Fadlallah's statement seemed to corroborate an offer made
earlier this month by the captors of Joseph Cicippio after they
suspended plans to kill the American hostage.
   They said they would free Cicippio if Israel released 450 Arab
prisoners and allowed 55 Palestinian deportees to return to the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel has offered to exchange Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Hezbollah-affiliated cleric kidnapped July 28 in southern Lebanon,
and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three Israelis
soldiers held in Lebanon and the Western hostages. Hezbollah has
refused to negotiate.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called
Fadlallah's comments ``interesting'' and said the Bush
administration hopes ``it signals their desire to release the
hostages.''
   ``We would like to lower our voices a little and let these
issues play out for a few days and see what happens,'' he said.
   Parades marking the Ashoura holiday were held in south Beirut
and in towns in eastern and southern Lebanon with predominantly
Shiite populations.
   The Ashoura holiday commemorates the killing of the saint
Hussein by Moslem armies after a 10-day siege at Karbala, now part
of Iraq. The battle was part of the fight over succession to
Mohammed that eventually split Islam into Sunni and Shiite branches.
   About 10,000 men, women and children participated in south
Beirut. Most were dressed in black and beat their heads and chests.
   Ahead of the marchers were loudspeaker vans covered with black
cloth and portraits of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian
revolutionary patriarch who died in June, and his successor, Ali
Khamenei.

   The interpreter for a Chinese acrobatic troupe
told federal immigration officials that she does not want political
asylum, and she says she wants to go home.
   Interpreter He Lanrong, 42, left the Nanjing Acrobatic Troupe on
Monday in Brooklyn. A day earlier, four of its performers had
disappeared after the troupe finished a 16-week tour with the Big
Apple Circus in Shelburne, Vt. Their whereabouts still are unknown.
   Mrs. He ``was referred to us by the United States Park Police
and we interviewed her to determine if she wanted to apply for any
benefits,'' said Charles Troy, spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service on Friday. ``She did not. She retained
counsel to advise her and that's it. She has no business before the
INS at this time.''
   Mrs. He told The New York Times that she left the troupe because
its director had blamed her for the acrobats' disappearance and
indicated that could create problems for her husband and daughter
in China.
   ``Contrary to some news reports, I have never said that I wanted
asylum in the United States,'' the Times quoted her as saying
Friday. ``I miss my family very much, and I love my country and
wish to return.''
   Troy said he did not know if Mrs. He has left the United States.

<UNK>Justice Minister Warns Estonian Voting Law Illegal</UNK>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet justice minister said Estonia's effort
to tighten voting residency laws that have sparked a strike by
thousands of Russian workers is unconstitutional.
   A nationwide newspaper placed the number of strikers in the
small Baltic republic at about 40,000, more than twice as many as
local journalists and the official Tass news agency estimated.
   Veniamin Yakovlev, Soviet justice minister, Friday told the
evening television news program ``Vremya'' that Estonia ought to
reconsider the law, which sets residence requirements to protect
Estonians' hold on the republic.
   ``I think it's obvious that this Estonian law doesn't correspond
to our constitution,'' Yakovlev said. ``This means that a
significant portion of the population will be left out.''
   Yakovlev said the law, passed Tuesday, also violated
international conventions on civil rights that the Soviet Union has
signed.
   But instead of flatly declaring the law void, Yakovlev appealed
to the Estonian Supreme Soviet to reconsider it.
   Under the law, residents of Estonia cannot vote unless they have
lived in the same district for at least two years, or have lived
anywhere in the republic for a total of five years.
   Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for
five years, or in Estonia for 10 years.
   Russian-speaking workers walked off their jobs the day after the
law was passed, and sent a delegation to Moscow to seek meetings
with national officials. Vasily Makismov, a member of the strike
committee, said in an interview from Tallinn that one member of the
delegation had returned and was meeting with strikers this morning.
   Maksimov said railroad stations were on strike and that the
state-run Aeroflot airline was shipping only emergency items such
as medical supplies and equipment. Passenger service was not
affected.
   The newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya reported today that
more than 30 factories and other state-run businesses were on
strike, including about 40,000 workers.
   ``Dialogue between the leaders of the republic and the strikers
has practically come to a halt,'' it said.
   The Estonian leadership acknowledged in a statement released
Friday that it failed to ``take into account fully the growth of
national consciousness among the non-Estonian population of the
republic,'' Tass reported.
   The Estonian parliament banned strikes Thursday, but the
strikers ignored the action.
   Tass on Friday put the number of strikers in Tallinn at 16,000.
A few enterprises in Kokhla-Jarve, a mining town east of Tallinn,
also were reported to be on strike.
   Strike committee members said workers at 42 Estonian factories
and firms walked out, but local journalists said they counted only
about 24 Estonian enterprises with striking employees.
   Non-Estonian residents of the republic, including leaders of the
Russian-dominated InterMovement group, complain the law is aimed at
them because many are new arrivals.
   They are also upset by a law making Estonian the official
language.
   Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the
population. Russians make up about a third of the 1.6 million
people.
   Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya quoted striking workers as
complaining that they want to get into courses to learn Estonian,
but that the few available are crowded and expensive.

<TEXT>
   The mailman who killed his wife and two
co-workers before ending the shooting spree with a bullet to his
head has died.
   John Merlin Taylor, 52, died Friday night at Palomar Medical
Center, soon after relatives gave permission for discontinuation of
life support, hospital spokesman Alain Jourdier said.
   Police remain baffled by Taylor's outburst Thursday and
investigators seeking a motive said the answers may have died with
Taylor.
   A model employee with a domestic life police described as
typically American, Taylor first shot his wife to death in the
couple's home and then drove to work at the Orange Glenn post
office, where he killed two colleagues and wounded another.
   Taylor then turned the gun on himself.
   ``It may be that Taylor just snapped,'' said Sgt. Dan Star, the
police detective in charge of the case. ``We're looking for the
reason, but if we don't find one soon, we'll close the
investigation.''
   Investigators spent Friday interviewing dozens of witnesses and
family members. Taylor's home, located about seven blocks from the
post office, and car also were searched but officers found no notes
or letters to explain his actions.
   Star said Taylor shot his wife in her sleep at least three times
with a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol, and then went to the post
office, where he opened fire on two friends, Ronald Williams, 56,
and Richard Berni, 38.
   Williams and Berni were shot as they drank coffee and talked.
Taylor typically joined them in the routine, Star said.
   Taylor then went into the post office and fired at least five
rounds, wounding postal clerk Paul Derisi in the arm.
   At the postal station, the flag flew at half-staff Friday and a
bouquet of flowers left by an unknown person rested at the base of
the flagpole.
   Flags at all San Diego County post offices will fly at
half-staff until the funerals of the two postal employees.
   Services for Williams were scheduled today. A service will be
held Monday for Berni, while funeral arrangements were incomplete
Friday for Taylor and Mrs. Taylor.

<TEXT>
   Four U.S. Blackhawk helicopters
joined an aerial search today for Rep. Mickey Leland and 15 others
missing since their plane left for a southwestern refugee camp five
days ago.
   Also today, Ethiopian helicopters rechecked one of two areas
outside the plane's flight path where a satellite picked up an
apparent distress signal, said James Haley, U.S. Embassy spokesman
in the capital.
   The UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters arrived Friday from Eglin Air
Force Base in Florida and joined two U.S. C-130 Hercules cargo
planes in the search of the rugged mountains southwest of the
capital, Haley said.
   ``They are capable of staying in the air all day because the
C-130s have refueling capability,'' Haley said.
   He said search efforts by the C-130s was concentrated on the
intended flight path of the twin-engine plane that disappeared
Monday with Leland on board. The Texas Democrat, chairman of the
House Select Committee on Hunger, was accompanied by eight other
Americans.
   The Twin Otter aircraft, owned by Ethiopia's government relief
agency, was en route from Addis Ababa to the Fugnido refugee camp
450 miles away near the Sudanese border.
   The C-130s joined the search Thursday when they arrived from
West Germany.
   Haley said today that the weather ``was not cooperating, but
they are able to search.''
   Weather has hampered the search since it began Tuesday and may
have played a role in the disappearance of the Canadian-made plane,
which seats up to 20 passengers. Officials have said the plane's
takeoff Monday morning was delayed two hours by rough weather and
that it departed in heavy clouds and poor visibility.
   The site of the apparent distress signal being checked again is
in an area around Goba about 85 miles southeast of the capital,
Haley said.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in
Washington has said its weather satellites picked up signals in
that area as well as about 100 miles north of Addis Ababa. A land
and air search of both areas on Friday turned up nothing.
   Asked how the satellites could have recorded false signals,
Haley replied, ``I've been trying to get an answer to that myself.''
   Leland's plane was equipped with an emergency locator
transmittor, a device usually mouted in the tail of an aircraft and
activated either automatically by impact or manually by the pilot.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington Friday the passengers had some box lunches, one or two
cases of soft drinks and 35 gallons of water. The prospect of
temperatures that can drop to freezing at night was a troubling
factor.
   Planes must fly over mountainous terrain to reach the Fugnido
refugee camp, but the route was not over the area where rebels are
battling Ethiopia's government. Ethiopia's separatist movements are
based in the northern part of the country in the Horn of Africa.
   A spokeswoman for Leland complained Friday that the rescue
effort lacked urgency.
   ``With all of the sophisticated surveillance that we have, with
all of the sophisticated equipment we have, we should have located
them by now,'' Alma Newsom said in Washington.
   President Bush, the State Department and Defense Department
defended the search efforts, which involved scores of U.S. military
personnel.
   ``I can understand the anxiety of all this and I can understand
the concern that people that love Mickey Leland feel and that I
feel,'' Bush said. ``But there's a lot going on, so let's just hope
and pray he's OK.''
   The Pentagon said late Friday that 170 military personnel had
been assigned to the search and that the number soon would reach
260.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. James F. Record, director of operations for
Central Command, was to leave today to take charge of the search,
the Pentagon said.
   The Pentagon said in a statement that two U-2 photographic
reconnaissance planes had exposed more than a mile of film in runs
over the 56,000-square mile search area, of which about 60 percent
was covered by clouds.
   Twelve Ethiopian helicopters also participated in the search.
   Haley said the eight other Americans aboard included three
members of Leland's staff, a friend of the congressman's, three
officers of the U.S. Agency for International Development officers
and the spouse of one AID official. Also aboard were an Ethiopian
employee of the U.S. Embassy, three Ethiopian officials and the
crew.
   Two of Leland's congressional colleagues, Reps. Gary Ackerman
and Alan Wheat, arrived in Addis Ababa early Friday to observe the
search effort. With them was Jack Russ, the sergeant-at-arms of the
House.
   Fugnido camp is run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
and is one of four in the region that house more than 300,000
refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring Sudan.

<HEAD>New Foreign Minister Says Tongue-Tied Americans Can't Compete</HEAD>

   The new foreign minister says Americans are to
blame for trade friction with his country because they don't
understand Japan, speak its language or try hard enough to
penetrate the Japanese market.
   The comments by Taro Nakayama on Friday came the same day Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he will visit Washington next month to
meet with President Bush and reaffirm relations with the United
States as the foundation of Japan's foreign policy.
   Nakayama, a physician appointed Wednesday after Kaifu took
office, said ``U.S. efforts are lacking'' and that Japan's
distribution system should not be held responsible for trade
tensions.
   ``While I am, of course, aware of the various opinions emanating
from the U.S. side in regard to Japan's distribution system, the
distribution systems of the United States and Japan differ as the
countries themselves differ,'' he said.
   He said ``Japan must speak its mind'' to bring the United States
around to its way of thinking.
   Many U.S. business leaders blame the large U.S. trade deficit
with Japan _ $55 billion last year _ on Japanese trade barriers,
and American lawmakers have called for retaliatory action.
   Americans often complain that Japan's complex distribution
system, in which longstanding relationships and delivery practices
take precedence over efficiency and cost cutting, are major
barriers to U.S. goods.
   The foreign minister said Americans have made considerable
progress in improving their understanding of the Japanese market
but still depend too much on Japanese who speak English rather than
learning the language themselves.
   ``How many Americans working in Japan can speak perfect
Japanese?'' he said.
   Nakayama was a member of a Liberal Democratic Party committee
that negotiated in Washington on trade issues. Referring to that
experience, he said:
   ``Americans then appeared to understand Japan, but in fact did
not. That's why it is so necessary to talk at length with the
United States. If that is not done, the United States, as can be
expected of them, will come up with various unilateral moves.''
   In an interview with Kyodo News Service, Nakayama was quoted as
saying he expected the Soviet Union to offer to return a group of
small islands off northern Japan in exchange for Japanese
technology and investment.
   Soviet soldiers have occupied the islands since the end of World
War II, and the dispute over them has kept the two nations from
signing a peace treaty.
   ``As international relations change, the Soviet government
authorities change and their way of thinking will change as well to
adapt to international circumstances,'' Nakayama was quoted as
saying.
   Kaifu on Friday pledged to push political and tax reform as a
way of preventing the kind of scandals and unpopular policies that
brought down his two predecessors and cost his governing Liberal
Democrats an upper house election.
   He succeeded Sousuke Uno, who resigned after only two months in
office to take responsibility for the governing party's election
defeat last month. The Liberal Democrats lost their majority in the
upper house of Parliament for the first time since the party was
formed in 1955.
   Uno took over from Noboru Takeshita, who resigned June 2 to take
responsibility for the Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal, which
reached the top ranks of politics, the bureaucracy and business.
Uno also was plagued by allegations that he had kept paid
mistresses.
   On Friday, only two days after taking office, Kaifu denied a
newspaper report that he had an illegitimate child as the result of
an affair with a model, and he demanded a retraction.

<HEAD>IBEW, Bell Atlantic Hold Talks; Strike Deadlines Saturday in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Phone companies in the Midwest continued negotiating with unions
to avert strike deadlines today, while Bell Atlantic Corp. went
back to the bargaining table with some of its striking workers.
   In the Midwest, the Communications Workers of America met with
officials from American Information Technologies Corp.'s five Bell
subsidiaries _ Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin Bell
_ to avert walkouts at 11:59 p.m. tonight, when three-year
contracts expire for 37,000 union workers.
   ``We're hopeful that we'll reach a settlement by the deadline,''
said spokesman Larry Cose of Illinois Bell.
   Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. issued a new contract proposal
Friday in an effort to ward off a strike tonight, but a union
spokesman said the offer is inadequate.
   ``It falls far short of acceptable levels in wages, health care,
job security, working conditions, protection of retiree health
benefits and other important areas,'' T.O. Parsons, vice president
of District 6 of the CWA, said Friday. The union represents about
40,000 Southwestern Bell employees in Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas,
Oklahoma and Texas.
   The proposal offers union employees guaranteed jobs and a bigger
pay increase, but it still requires them to pay part of their
health insurance bills. The company has picked up the entire health
insurance tab in the past.
   Meanwhile, striking electrical workers Friday held their first
formal talks with Bell Atlantic since the strike began early
Sunday. Bell Atlantic spokesman Thomas Duddy did not disclose the
proposals exchanged by the two sides, but said it was encouraging
negotiations had resumed.
   Representatives of more than 41,000 CWA members were scheduled
to resume formal negotiations with Bell Atlantic on Saturday.
   Three regional telephone company strikes began Sunday after
negotiations broke down over wage, health care and various local
issues. Bell Atlantic operates in the District of Columbia,
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware and
Pennsylvania.
   Strikes also continued against NYNEX Corp., which operates in
New York and New England, and Pacific Telesis, in California and
Nevada.
   The strikes affected 157,000 union workers in 15 states. The
three regional telephone companies are continuing operations by
placing managers in jobs normally held by union members.
   In Boston, several hundred striking workers and their supporters
shouted ``scab'' at phone company managers and customers who
crossed a picket line. One customer received a police escort to
leave the building.
   Myles Calvey, business manager of Local 2222 of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said the strikers
would not accept the company's demands to share in health insurance
costs, even if that meant a long strike.
   ``You can't sell something like this when the membership doesn't
want it,'' Calvey said.
   NYNEX has paid 100 percent of its employees' health insurance
costs for more than a decade, but now wants its workers to
contribute.
   In New York, 32 of the state's union local presidents are
scheduled to meet Tuesday to plan a campaign to urge a national
phone bill boycott.
   ``What we are going to do is put the word out across the country
that people living in any struck area should not pay their
telephone bills,'' said Rick Martini, a CWA official.

   Three men convicted of throwing paint on the
portait of Mao Tse-Tung in Tiananmen Square during the
pro-democracy movement were given prison terms ranging from 16
years to life.
   The Beijing Intermediate Court, in sentencing the men Friday,
said they were guilty of ``counterrevolutionary destruction and
counterrevolutionary incitement and must be punished severely,''
the Beijing Evening News reported.
   The court sentenced high school teacher Yu Zhijian to life in
prison and gave 16-year and 20-year prison terms to two
accomplices, Yu Dongyue and Lu Decheng.
   The three, all in their 20s, are from central China's Hunan
province, Mao's birthplace. Offical reports say they came to
Beijing May 19, one day before martial law was declared, to take
part in student-led pro-democracy protests.
   On May 23, as tens of thousands of protesters paraded through
Tiananmen Square, the men threw black and red paint at the nearly
30-foot-tall portrait of Mao that hangs from Tiananmen gate
overlooking the square.
   Splotches of paint smeared Mao's neck, collar and one eyebrow,
and a long line of paint ran down the side of his nose and mouth.
   Workers quickly covered the portrait with canvas, and that night
a crane removed it and put a nearly identical portrait in its place.
   The men were grabbed on the spot by angry student protesters
who, after some debate, turned them over to police. The students
said they opposed vandalism.
   The army crushed the pro-democracy movement June 3-4 when troops
fired on unarmed civilians and drove the demonstrators from the
square.
   The government says 200 people were killed; Chinese witnesses
and Western intelligence reports say up to 3,000 died.

<HEAD>Registration of Presidential Candidates Ends in Chile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Registration of presidential candidates
closed with a Christian Democrat backed by a 17-party opposition
group pitted against an ex-Cabinet member under rightist military
President Augusto Pinochet.
   Also Friday, a government spokesman said Cabinet changes will be
announced next week. He said some ministers were expected to step
down and run for senator in the scheduled Dec. 14 general
elections, the first since a bloody 1973 coup led by Pinochet.
   Patricio Aylwin, 70, the centrist Christian Democratic Party
president, and Hernan Buchi, 40, finance minister for four years
until he resigned in April, were the principal presidential
candidates to register with the national elections board.
   A conservative businessman, Francisco Errazuriz, and an
internationally recognized child nutrition specialist, Fernando
Monckeberg, also registered but were not expected to draw
widespread support.
   Opinion polls show Aylwin, a former senate president, with a
huge lead over Buchi. Aylwin is supported by 17 centrist and
leftist parties that united last year to defeat a referendum
proposal that Pinochet remain in power until 1997.
   Buchi emerged only Thursday night as the principal
pro-government candidate when a rival, Sergio Jarpa, 68, announced
he would not run for president.
   Buchi, an independent, is backed by the Pinochet government and
a well-financed group of business leaders. They pressed Jarpa,
leader of National Renovation, not to split the pro-government camp
by opposing Buchi. National Renovation is the principal rightist
party.
   Pinochet could not run because the constitution prohibits a
president from holding two consecutive terms. He has said he plans,
however, to remain commander of the country's powerful army for
eight more years. The law bars the new president from removing him
from that post.
   Registration of candidates for the House of Deputies also ended
on Friday, with more than 300 pursuing the House's 120 seats.
Registration of candidates for the 38 Senate seats ends Sept. 7.
   Pinochet, 73, seized power on Sept. 11, 1973, toppling an
elected leftist government during a period of social and economic
disorder. He was obliged to call elections when voters last October
rejected a proposal that he remain the nation's leader until 1997.

<HEAD>Texas Voters To Decide Replacement for Wright</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fort Worth-area voters cast ballots today in a
special election to select a replacement for former U.S. House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   Four Democrats, three Republicans and a Libertarian are on the
ballot to fill the District 12 seat Wright first was elected to in
1955.
   Wright stepped down as speaker in May and later resigned his
House seat in the face of an ethics investigation that turned up 69
instances of alleged rules violations.
   Wright, a Democrat, has not endorsed anyone.
   The Democrats vying for his spot are Pete Geren, Jim Lane and
George Petrovich Jr., all Fort Worth attorneys, and Bill Turner,
who owns a fence store.
   Laraine Bethke, a former aide to U.S. Rep. Dick Armey, Jim
Hunter, a private investigator, and Dr. Bob Lanier, a physician
with a syndicated televison show on health matters, are the
Republican candidates. Robert Buckingham Jr., manager of an
oil-change garage, is the Libertarian.
   The special election is to fill the rest of Wright's term,
ending in January 1991. A runoff is expected in late August or
September because no candidate is expected to win 50 percent of the
vote.
   Lanier, who is host of the nationally syndicated television show
``60 Second Housecall,'' and Geren are considered the front-runners.
   The two were leaders in a recent poll and each has his party's
endorsement, although Lane has important endorsements from labor
and police.

<HEAD>Animal Activists Disrupt Start of Grouse Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights campaigners crept onto moors before
dawn in northern England today to disrupt an already quiet Glorious
Twelfth of August, the traditional opening of the grouse season.
   About 90 supporters of the Hunt Saboteurs' Association occupied
two northern English moors in Geltsdale, near Carlisle and Stanhope
to shoo away the birds, said a spokesman, Ben Ponton.
   ``The action will go on as long as it has to,'' he said. ``The
shooting parties are driving around but have made no attempt to get
onto the moors.''
   Another 100 members had also gathered in Bowland but thick mist
had kept hunters away, said Ponton, whose group annually tries to
disrupt the shooting of the prized game.
   Aristocrats and wealthy tourists organize hunting parties on
Scottish and English moors to kick off the Glorious Twelfth, and in
past years restaurants have vied to bring the birds to the table.
   But this year disease has decimated the flocks, leading to the
cancellation of many shoots.
   ``Grouse numbers are 20 percent down in some parts of Scotland
and there's no shooting at all today in parts of the north of
England'' where populations have fallen 50 percent, said Dr. Peter
Hudson of the private research group the Game Conservancy.
   Influenced by the animal protesters of recent years and worries
over declining numbers of the birds, hotels and restaurants have
all but dropped their own colorful races to serve the birds.
   The prestigious Gleneagles Hotel, once a forerunner in the
competition, said it will donate the money it would have used for
the race to grouse preservation research for a fifth year.
   But the bird will still feature on the menu of some restaurants,
served with thin fried potatoes, parsley and a bread sauce.

<TEXT>
   An interstate chase that turned
into a standoff between police and kidnappers armed with grenades
and holding three hostages stretched into a fourth day today on a
south-central highway, officials said.
   The kidnappers, identified as two married couples who earlier
obtained a $42,000 ransom in exchange for freeing a 9-year-old boy
they abducted, set a 3 p.m. (2 p.m. EDT) deadline to swap their
captives for food, a pilot and a getaway helicopter to fly them to
Paraguay.
   ``The trade will be made at that time without any tricks,''
police Officer Nivaldo de Pirondi said in a telephone interview
from Presidente Prudente, near the site of the standoff and 525
miles west of Rio.
   ``We don't want to do anything to provoke the kidnappers and put
the hostages' lives at risk,'' de Pirondi said. ``We are dealing
with professionals, but they are charged up and could do something
irrational at any moment.''
   He said the hostages _ two TV reporters and the driver of the
armored car _ were in fair physical condition. They were being held
in the armored car, which about 100 heavily armed police have
surrounded since early Friday with sharpshooters aiming at the
car's small windows.
   The standoff began after a three-day chase through south-central
Brazil, police said.
   Authorities were delayed in meeting the kidnappers' demands
because the first aircraft developed mechanical trouble and was
grounded in a nearby field, de Pirondi said.
   He said a second helicopter was summoned from Brasilia, the
capital, and was due to arrive early this afternoon.
   The drama began Aug. 3, when the two couples abducted 9-year-old
Said Agel Filho from his home in the central Brazilian city of
Goiania, 565 miles northwest of Sao Paulo. The kidnapping was kept
secret at first to protect the child, police said.
   Six days later, police found where the boy was being held, but
the kidnappers negotiated a ransom of about $42,000 and an armored
car for their getaway. They then took the two TV reporters and
headed for the Goiania Airport.
   However, Goias state authorities failed to provide an airplane
and pilot for their escape, and the kidnappers set off on an
interstate flight through the states of Goias, Minas Gerais and Sao
Paulo.

<TEXT>
   Masked Palestinians today killed two Arabs
suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities in the West
Bank, stabbing one and hanging the other in a school courtyard,
Arab reports said.
   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops and allied Lebanese
militiamen Thursday night shot and wounded a guerrilla whose unit
planned to infiltrate Israel, the army said. The wounded man was
captured, but his companions escaped.
   In the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, masked Palestinians
repeatedly stabbed Murshed Kaniery, 55, after accusing him of
collaborating with Israeli security forces, Arab reports said. He
died later in a Nablus hospital.
   In Bidiya village near Tulkarem in the West Bank, masked Arabs
hanged 30-year-old school teacher Jamal Taha in his school's
courtyard, Arabs said.
   Palestinians said the army imposed a curfew on Bidiya after the
early-morning killing and deployed hundreds of troops to search the
village and surrounding fields for the attackers.
   The deaths raised to at least 94 the number of Palestinians
killed by fellow Arabs during the 20-month-old uprising against
Israeli rule, most of them on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel.
   Troops or Jewish settlers have killed 534 Palestinians during
the uprising. Thirty-eight Jews have also been killed.
   Israeli soldiers detected the guerrilla squad near Markaba
village in the central sector of Israel's self-declared security
zone, an army statement said.
   The force opened fire, wounding one guerilla who was captured by
South Lebanese Army militiamen allied with Israel, the statement
said. The rest of the squad escaped. None of the Israel or militia
troops was injured.
   The statement said the squad apparently planned to carry out an
attack on a northern Israeli settlement, but it gave no details.
   Israel radio said Israeli and militia units conducted widespread
searches for the other guerrillas and quoted a senior army officer
as saying they apparently were Palestinians.
   The clash occurred 1.5 miles from the Israeli settlement of
Misgav Am near the Lebanese border. It was the third incident in
the security zone this month.
   On Wednesday, five Israeli soldiers were wounded, one of them
critically, when a suicide bomber from the Moslem fundamentalist
Hezbollah militia drove an explosive-laden car into an Israeli
convoy two miles north of the Israeli border near Qleiaa village. A
militiaman also was wounded in the blast.
   On Aug. 1, militiamen shot and killed three guerillas from the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the central sector
of the security zone near Hula village.

<HEAD>Tamils: More Than 50 Civilians Killed in Indian Army Offensive</HEAD>

   Indian troops killed at least 51
civilians after being attacked by Tamil rebels in a northern town,
Tamil sources said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 40 houses
and 23 shops were set on fire by the soldiers after an army patrol
was ambushed Aug. 2 in the town of Velvettiturai, 200 miles north
of Colombo. At least six soldiers were killed in the attack,
military officials said at the time.
   The Tamil sources, who have proved reliable in the past, quoted
residents as saying the Indian peacekeeping troops imposed a
48-hour curfew on Velvettiturai after the ambush and carried out
search operations.
   Many houses were shelled and several people were burned to
death, the sources said. They said that 51 victims were identified
by relatives after the curfew was withdrawn.
   The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the rebel group fighting
the Indians, said in a statement telexed to newspaper offices that
at least 70 civilians were killed in the offensive. The Tigers'
accounts of casualties have proved to be exaggerated in the past.
   Sri Lankan military officials confirmed a major operation by
Indian troops occurred in Velvettiturai, but they said they did not
have details because they do not operate in the Tamil-dominated
areas of the country.
   In New Delhi, a government spokesman said there were 18 civilian
casualties in an exchange of gunfire between the soldiers and the
rebels after the ambush.
   He said the rebels used civilians as cover while firing with
rocket-propelled grenades and automatic rifles at the Indian army
patrol.
   ``The troops returned fire and 30 bodies were recovered after
the fighting,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules. ``At least five were hard-core Tigers and seven
others were sympathizers.''
   ``Eighteen unfortunate civilians were killed in the cross
fire,'' he said. The spokesman denied that civilians were killed
during the curfew.
   ``The Tamils in Velvettiturai will say whatever the Tigers tell
them to,'' he said. ``The Tigers' capacity to kill fellow Tamils is
unlimited and they live in fear of retribution.''
   Indian soldiers have been in Sri Lanka's Tamil-dominated north
and east for the past two years to put down the Tamil war for an
independent homeand.
   They were deployed to supervise an India-sponsored accord under
which Sri Lanka offered Tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an
arms surrender. But the Tigers rejected the agreement and turned
their guns on the Indians.
   India got involved because of the sympathies of its own 60
million Tamils to the rebel cause.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
allege they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up
75 percent of the population and control the government and the
military.
   Militant Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983. At least
11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed in
the fighting.

   Syrian and Christian gunners locked in
one of their fiercest battles in months pummeled the Beirut area
today in an exchange that reportedly left at least 12 people dead
and 48 wounded.
   Smoke from shells and fires in nearby hills hung like a funeral
shroud over the city. Five months of such duels have prompted all
but about 200,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million residents to flee.
   Police said at least 12 people were killed and 48 wounded in
today's fighting between Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 predominantly
Christian troops and 40,000 Syrian soldiers and their Moslem
militia allies.
   More than 40 have died in the past two days, bringing the toll
since March 8 to 598 killed and 1,562 wounded, according to
security sources.
   Radios interrupted their programs with bulletins about where
shells were falling and to report fires blazing out of control in
several parts of Beirut.
   A police spokesman said fierce clashes with machine guns,
recoilless cannons and rocket-propelled grenade launchers raged
across Beirut's dividing Green Line and the eastern flank of the
Christian enclave.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem cabinet
vying for power with the military cabinet under Aoun, said: ``We're
left in the blowing wind with no roof above us.''
   ``The problem in Lebanon is that our wise people are not active
and our active people are not wise,'' Hoss said in a statement
broadcast by Voice of the Nation radio.
   The French and Argentine embassies in neighboring Baabda were
hit by Syrian rockets and one French embassy guard was slightly
wounded, security sources said. The embassies are only a hundred
yards away from the shell-shattered presidential palace, where Aoun
has been living in a bunker since the latest round of fighting in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war began in March.
   The security sources said the residences of U.S. Ambassador John
McCarthy and French Ambassador Rene Ala in suburban Yarze east of
Beirut came under shellfire for a second night in a row, but no
casualties or serious damage were reported.
   In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said today that it had
asked Syrian officials in Damascus to immediately end the Syrian
bombardments. The ministry also called for all sides to lift
blockades and begin peace talks.
   In Washington Friday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler called for all parties to cease fire, but she also singled
out Syria for its use of heavy weapons against civilians.
   ``The United States condemns the indiscriminate slaughter of
innocent people and the renewed use of heavy caliber weapons, such
as the 240-millimeter mortar, which are in the Syrian arsenal,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``We again call upon Syria, an active participant in the
fighting, the Lebanese armed forces, as well as the various
Lebanese factions, for an immediate cease-fire.''
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said Syrian gunners opened fire at 6 a.m. from
multibarreled rocket launchers at the Christian enclave, shattering
a two-hour lull in the fighting.
   The whooshing sound of outgoing rockets echoed across the
mountains southeast of Beirut. A few minutes later, howitzer shells
fired by Aoun's gunners crashed into the region, sending palls of
dust and smoke into the sky.
   Syrian soldiers deserted their sand-bagged checkpoints at the
Khaldeh junction south of Beirut and sought refuge in fox holes
along the sandy coast.
   Several motorists abandoned their cars and fled under the main
highway bridge in Khaldeh. Others sped away.
   Aoun's gunners, using 155-mm U.S.-made howitzers, concentrated
their shelling on Syrian artillery emplacements, truck-mounted
rocket launchers and communications posts in the hills of Aramoun
and Doha, above Khaldeh.
   A howitzer shell, fired by Aoun's gunners, scored a direct hit
on a 40-barrel rocket launcher on a hilltop in Aramoun, setting it
on fire.
   Black smoke billowed from the truck-mounted launcher for 20
minutes, during which the Syrians intensified their shelling of the
Christian enclave, operating more than a dozen rocket launchers in
unison.
   Security sources said rockets and shells fired by Syrian gunners
targeted almost every town and village in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave northeast of the capital.

<HEAD>Fatah Congress Reaffirms Right to Armed Struggle Against Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fifth congress of Fatah, the largest
arm of the PLO, has issued a final declaration rejecting terrorism
but reaffirming the right to armed struggle against Israeli
occupation.
   The declaration, made public late Friday night, said the
congress has decided to mobilize ``all means'' to assure
continuation of the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   It also called on the United States to ``clearly recognize'' the
right of Palestinians to self-determination and an independent
state.
   The eight-day congress of more than 1,000 delegates of the
mainstream branch of the Palestine Liberation Organization ended
Thursday. It had called on Tuesday for ``intensification of the
armed struggle and all other forms of battle to put an end to the
Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.''
   The final declaration reiterated the call to intensify the
uprising, mobilizing ``all means'' available. It also called for
the reinforcement of the uprising's unified command and developing
a role for people's committees.
   The congress reiterated Fatah's rejections of ``all forms of
terrorism, notably state terrorism.'' But it reaffirmed its ``right
to use all means, including armed struggle, to confront the Israeli
occupier, in conformity with United Nations declarations on the
rights of the Palestinian people.''
   The final statement deplored the slow pace of the U.S.-PLO
dialogue, which got under way Dec. 16. It called on the Americans
to ``clearly recongize the right of Palestinians to
self-determination and the establishment of an independent state
having Jerusalem as its capital, and to depart from their
partiality vis-a-vis Israel.''
   The United States opened a formal dialogue with the PLO after
the organization's leader, Yasser Arafat, renounced terrorism and
implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist.

<HEAD>Catholic Group Suspects U.S. Involvement With Philippine Vigilantes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of Roman Catholic priests and
nuns announced today it has asked national lawmakers to investigate
whether the United States has promoted anti-Communist vigilantes in
this country.
   The Philippine military has used vigilante groups as support
units to combat a 20-year-old communist insurgency. Some members
belong to religious cults, and some have been criticized for
violating human rights during sweeps of suspected rebel hideouts.
   In its statement distributed to news agencies today, The
Association of Major Religious Superiors in the Philippines said it
had asked the country's two-chamber Congress ``to initiate a
comprehensive investigation into and expose the extent of reported
U.S. involvement, both directly and indirectly, in supporting the
formation, training and operation of vigilante groups.''
   It said, ``The nation is caught in a vicious war and is
experiencing an escalation of violence. This phenomenon is not
unconnected with an international organized effort to polarize the
situation along ideological lines.'' The statement gave no
specifics of purported U.S. involvement with vigilante groups.
   The Catholic group, which includes at least 10,000 priests and
nuns, also requested the investigation during its national
convention late last month.

   Columbia's astronauts closed down
experiments and checked flight control systems today as they
prepared to end their secret military mission on Sunday with a
landing in the California desert.
   Commander Brewster Shaw and pilot Richard Richards were to run
through a series of tests to make certain the shuttle's computers
and control jets were ready for the return to Earth.
   Mission specialists David Leestma, James Adamson and Mark Brown
were to pack up the experiments, some of which were believed to be
connected with the ``Star Wars'' spaceborne missile defense
project. Others tested the astronauts' capabilities as military
observers in space.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration broke the
official silence on the mission today to announce that Columbia
would land at 9:37 a.m. EDT Sunday in the Mojave Desert at Edwards
Air Force, Calif., after a flight of five days, one hour. Earlier,
it had said only that landing would take place between 9 a.m. and
noon.
   ``The crew is doing well and is beginning landing
preparations,'' a statement said.
   The weather forecast called for excellent landing conditions at
Edwards on Sunday, with partly cloudy skies and temperatures
expected from 68 just after sunrise to a midday high of 97 degrees.
   The Air Force base, which has been host to as many as half a
million people for shuttle landings, will be closed to the public
Sunday because of the military nature of the flight.
   The news blackout was imposed by the Defense Department, which
wants to keep the flight's goals a secret. But Air Force Secretary
Donald Rice reported Wednesday that a satellite was deployed by the
astronauts during their first day in orbit on Tuesday.
   Rice was mum about the satellite's purpose, but it is widely
believed to be a 10-ton spy satellite designed to take very
detailed photographs of military targets over a wide area of the
globe, including most of the Soviet Union. It would help the United
States verify Soviet compliance with arms agreements.
   The crew of five military officers also reportedly monitored
military tactical and strategic targets on Earth.

<HEAD>Bomb Explodes Before Protestant March, IRA Claims Responsibility</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with IRA claiming responsibility for bomb,

<TEXT>
   A large IRA bomb exploded
downtown today hours before Protestants marched through the streets
on the tense anniversaries of both ancient and recent sectarian
strife in the region.
   The bomb caused no injuries, and the annual Apprentice Boys'
Parade marking the end of a Catholic siege of the city 300 years
ago began on schedule.
   Marching bands featuring piping flutes and humming accordions
alternated with men carrying banners commemorating the siege.
   ``The way we look at it we're more besieged than ever before,''
said Robert Kerr, a Protestant farmer from Dungannon district, as
he watched the marchers. The bomb ``means we have no security. For
the amount of money they're spending, we should get better
security.''
   Sectarian violence at the parade 20 years ago led to the
deployment of British troops in the province two days later, and
heralded the start of the sectarian and political warfare that has
torn the province since then.
   Supporters of the Irish Republican Army fighting the troops plan
a march Sunday in Belfast to mark the anniversary and the
introduction of an unpopular British policy of internment, since
ended but not forgotten.
   Security forces were on full alert throughout the province and
extra police and soldiers were stationed in Londonderry.
   Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a Butcher
Street bar which was ``extensively damaged.'' It had been
discovered by security forces who evacuated the area, but it
exploded before army experts could defuse it, said a spokesman who
refused to be named.
   The bar, which was closed, was near the parade route on the
fringes of a Catholic area where extra police were to be deployed,
he said. ``It's close to an area where there might be opposition to
the parade,'' he said.
   Later, the outlawed mainly Roman Catholic IRA claimed
responsibility for the bomb, saying it was timed to go off while
security forces were in the area.
   An estimated 15,000 Protestants were expected to turn out for
the parade marking the relief of the city in August 1689 from the
besieging army of Catholic King James II. It is named after the 13
apprentice boys who shut the city gates against James' army at the
start of the 105-day siege.
   On Sunday, the Belfast parade will mark the 18th anniversary of
the now-abandoned policy of internment without trial for terrorist
suspects introduced Aug. 9, 1971, as well as the arrival of British
troops.
   Almost 2,000 people were held for varying lengths of time
without trial before Britain abandoned internment in December 1975
following worldwide condemnation.
   IRA supporters, who were the main targets of internment,
continue to mark the anniversary of its introduction each year with
bonfire-lit demonstrations and sporadic rioting sometimes lasting
several days.
   Tension has been heightened by the death of a 15-year-old
Catholic, Seamus Duffy. British news reports said he died Wednesday
when he was hit by a plastic bullet fired by police after they were
attacked during anti-internment rioting in Belfast. But his friends
and family deny he was involved in rioting.
   About 1,000 mourners attended the boy's funeral in Belfast on
Friday, which passed peacefully but caused rioting Friday night by
Catholic youths in the north Belfast area where he lived.
   Cars were set on fire and two youths were injured when police
fired plastic bullets to control the trouble, reported the British
new agency, Press Association.
   British troops in the province currently number more than
10,000, compared a peak of 22,000 at the height of the violence in
1972.
   They are backed by 6,500 members of the Ulster Defense Regiment,
a locally recruited unit of the British Army.

   Eastern Airlines' striking unions today launched a
large new lobbying effort after a week when hundreds of their own
pilots and flight attendants crossed picket lines.
   ``Now they're out there telling the world it's over. Well, it's
not over,'' Charles E. Bryan, leader of Eastern's Machinists union,
exhorted some 300 people at a morning rally across the street from
Eastern corporate headquarters. ``So hang in there. There'll be
good news coming.''
   Bryan joined Henry A. Duffy, national president of the Air Line
Pilots Association, and other leaders on the first blocks of a
``moving picket line'' march that began a 26-day, 13-state series
of parades, motorcades, rallies and lobbying efforts.
   ``Before this is over, the whole country's going to wake up to
what's going on,'' said John J. Bavis, chairman of the Eastern
pilots union local.
   The AFL-CIO, Machinists and flight attendants are also
participating in the rallies, but the strike's sixth month has
begun with a wave of picket-line defections, prompting Eastern to
say Friday it no longer needed to hire pilots.
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
five days after being hit by a crippling strike by its three unions
March 4, plans to rebuild to an airline two-thirds its pre-strike
size. The company's plan for its creditors said it would be flying
800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots by the end of the year.
   Eastern has 350 daily flights, compared to nearly 1,100 before
the strike.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell declined to give figures on
Eastern's pilots, but sources speaking on condition of anonymity
have said more than 600 union pilots are flying, including some 250
who have crossed picket lines since the union leadership last
weekend discussed ending the strike.
   Eastern has graduated 300 newly hired pilots from training and
has from 700 to 800 in training.
   Veteran pilots who want to return to work now will instead be
put on ``a preferential recall list'' and given priority for future
openings, Matell said.
   Hank Weber, spokesman for Eastern's Air Line Pilots Association,
was skeptical about whether Eastern has hired enough qualified
pilots, but said Friday's announcement will stop the flow of pilot
crossovers.
   ``There were people who crossed the picket line because of
uncertainty,'' Weber said. ``That will stop now. Thank you,
Eastern.''
   Weber said the vast majority of the 3,600 ALPA Eastern pilots
remain strongly committed to the strike.
   Meanwhile, officials said the number of flight attendants
abandoning the strike after more than five months has also jumped
this week.
   A source who spoke on the condition of not being identified said
140 flight attendants crossed the picket lines this week, probably
because of perceptions that the pilot crossovers hurt the strike.
   ``I'm not really sure on the complete impact,'' said Mary Jane
Barry, president of the flight attendants union. ``When there's a
breaking in the ranks, it affects all of us.''
   She said she didn't have any figures on total flight attendant
crossovers, but did not dispute a figure of at least 1,000 from the
union's 6,000 members.
   Eastern's rebuilding plan calls for 3,400 flight attendants.
Company officials have said 1,000 new flight attendants have been
hired or are in training. Eastern has received 31,000 applications
and is being ``very, very selective,'' Matell said.
   The 8,500-member Machinists union, joined by the other two
unions when it struck March 4 after 1{ years of federal mediation
failed, has held relatively solid. Some 100 union mechanics are
working for Eastern, which also has hired several hundred more and
is using 700 supervisors in maintenance roles.
   Eastern wants 2,500 mechanics by year's end, the company has
said.

   Mike ``Radar'' Reid, a short hitter
playing on a long course, took a two-stroke lead today into the
third round of the 71st PGA championship.
   Reid shot 34-33_67 in Friday's rain-delayed round to go with his
opening round of 66 for an 11-under-par 133.
   Trailing Reid were Leonard Thompson, who shared the first-round
lead with Reid, and Craig Stadler at 135.
   Tom Watson, another stroke back at 136, was seeking the only
major championship he has not won in his quest for a rare career
grand slam of the major tournaments.
   Stadler shot a course record 33-31_64 in a bogey-free second
round for his 135.
   Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer made the cut of one-over-par 145
for the top 70 scorers. Nicklaus had a four-under 140 and Palmer,
who electrified the crowds Thursday with a 68, had a second-round
74 for 142.
   Grouped at 137 were Dave Rummells, Chris Perry, Ed Fiori and
Andy Bean. U. S. Open champion Curtis Strange was at 138. Defending
champion Jeff Sluman and pre-tournament favorite Greg Norman barely
made the cut at 145.
   Failing to make the cut were former PGA champions Lee Trevino,
Lanny Wadkins, John Mahaffey, David Graham, Hal Sutton and Bob
Tway. Other casualties included former U.S. Open and Masters champ
Fuzzy Zoeller, Mark O'Meara and Scott Verplank.
   Because of the rain delay Friday, the last eight groups of 24
golfers finished the second round early this morning.
   Reid, who earned his nickname because of his exact shot-making
ability, agreed that he was an unlikely leader.
   ``But that's the great thing about sports,'' he said. ``The
(Chicago) Cubs shouldn't be in first place in August, either.''
   Watson, 39, stayed close while the other heroes of decades past,
Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, fell back.
   ``If you'd asked me two months ago if I had a chance to win the
PGA, I'd have said `no,''' Watson said Friday. ``The leader board
says `yes.'''
   It says no to Palmer, 59, and Nicklaus, 49, despite their
impressive early play.
   Nicklaus called his round ``another adventure. I had only one
easy par. I was all over the course. If it hadn't been for my
putter, I'd be in the 80s.''
   He hasn't been using his driver because of his erratic play with
it.
   ``I'm going to use my driver if I can,'' he said. ``If I hit it,
it will give me a chance to get home in two. I need it on a few
holes.''
   Does that mean Nicklaus still thinks he can win his sixth PGA
title?
   ``I'm in good shape. When you're four under in the PGA, I don't
care who's leading, I know I'm not going to be very far off.''
   Palmer made the turn at five under, but dropped a shot at No. 11
with a bogey-5.
   ``Three-putting No. 11 threw me off track,'' said Palmer, whose
Army was marching again after his exciting opening round.
   He missed a five-foot putt for a birdie at No. 12 and took a
double bogey-5 at the 13th.
   ``Other than that, I had a solid round,'' Palmer said. ``I
didn't feel any letdown, I just had to work hard to keep it
together.''
   Palmer parred the last five holes and said, ``I still feel good
and I feel good about the way I'm hitting the ball.''
   It marked the first time Palmer has made the cut in a major
tournament since the 1987 PGA. He made the cut in all four majors
in 1983.
   Play was suspended Friday for one hour, 48 minutes in the
afternoon because of a rainstorm.
   Once again, the 7,197-yard Kemper Lakes layout had ideal playing
conditions despite the rain delay, and the game's greatest players
took advantage.
   Reid, who missed only one green and one fairway Thursday, missed
five fairways and four greens in the second round.
   ``It wasn't as pretty,'' Reid said, ``but I showed some
character. I hung in there and got the most out of my round.''
   Stadler called his round ``very enjoyable. I made all the three,
four, five-foot putts I had. I didn't miss a fairway yesterday and
I missed only two or three today. I was happy with a solid round to
get back in the tournament.''
   Thompson also didn't play as well as he did in the first round.
   ``The first part of my round today was an adventure until I
settled down,'' said Thompson, who had an eagle, four birdies and
three bogeys.
   Strange said he would like to see the wind come up because
``Kemper Lakes is playing too easy. It is a tougher course than it
is playing.''

   A fire destroyed 300 acres of forest land
on this popular resort island before it was brought under control
Saturday.
   No injuries or property damage were reported.
   The wind-whipped fire started Friday evening in the central part
of the island and spread quickly, the Forest Service said.
   Despite the efforts of two small firefighting planes and
hundreds of firefighters, the blaze raged out of control through
the night.
   As dawn approached, five more firefighting aircraft arrived from
the mainland and together with 600 firefighters and soldiers they
brought the fire under control at 10:15 a.m., the service said.

   After the House Ways and Means Committee
finished writing the landmark 1986 tax overhaul, Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski hung a ``gone fishin''' sign on the office door to
dramatize that the time had come to stop changing the tax law.
   The fish apparently weren't biting. Since that time, the
committee and the counterpart Senate Finance Committee have kept
themselves busy adding to, rolling back, correcting and otherwise
changing the new law.
   There was the Revenue Act of 1987, about 200 changes designed
chiefly to raise revenue for budget reduction. Next came the
Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, whose explanation
alone filled a 291-page book. Then, the catastrophic-illness law,
which imposed a new surtax on upper-income older Americans to
finance protection under Medicare.
   ``In the last 13 years, 138 public laws have been enacted which
changed the Internal Revenue Code,'' Lawrence B. Gibbs, then
commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, told a House panel in
February. ``We are seeing higher levels of anxiety born of
frustration that comes from an inability to cope with this much
change. ... Let us all catch our breath.''
   Adds Steve Corrick of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm:
``There is certainly a point _ and we've reached it _ where you
ought to stop and let people at least get familiar with the law,
find out whether the rules are actually working like Congress
intended. Congress and the IRS keep complaining about reduced
compliance. Well, in order to comply with the rules you have to
know what they are.''
   Nevertheless, new law No. 139 is on the way.
   The 1989 tax bill being written by Ways and Means already
includes more than 100 sections with many issues yet to be
considered. The $5.3 billion pricetag makes it sound smaller than
it is; in fact, the figure simply means that the bill would raise
taxes $5.3 billion more than it would cut taxes in the budget year
that begins Oct. 1.
   It would cut billions of dollars of taxes for many individuals
and businesses and raise them by billions on others.
   For example, taxes on some low-income working families with
children would go down because the earned-income tax credit would
be liberalized. The scheduled expiration of the 3 percent tax on
local and long-distance telephone service would be canceled, so
phone users would lose an expected benefit.
   Taxes on defense contractors that use the completed-contract
method of accounting would face a tax increase. Companies that
increase spending for research and experimentation could continue
claiming a tax credit that otherwise would expire this year.
   The most striking aspect of the still-developing bill is that it
would roll back some recent laws that have been a major source of
pride for tax-writers. Among them:
   _CAPITAL GAINS: A major premise of the 1986 overhaul was that
all income should be taxed alike, meaning that capital gains _
profits from the sale of investments _ should lose preferential
treatment. President Bush wants to restore that preference, saying
it would spur the economy, and a number of Democrats are willing to
go along because such a change would boost revenues for one or two
years and help reduce the deficit.
   Democratic leaders, insisting a capital-gains cut would bloat
the deficit in future years, are scrambling to devise a way to
derail a capital-gains rate reduction. Some type of capital-gains
change is likely, although there is general agreement it would add
new complexity to the tax law.
   _CATASTROPHIC: Responding to complaints from upper-income
retirees, who pay most of the cost of Medicare protection against
costs of catastrophic illness, the Ways and Means Committee has
voted to reduce benefits and shift more of the expense to older
Americans with lower incomes.
   _HEALTH BENEFITS: The committee has yielded to protests of
businesses and agreed to eliminate from the 1986 law a requirement
that employers subject their health-insurance plans to complex
mathematical tests to demonstrate that they do not discriminate in
favor of workers earning more than about $50,000 a year. Instead,
employers would simply have to show that a health plan is available
to 90 percent of employees at a reasonable cost.
   _TAX SHELTERS: With almost no debate, the committee agreed to
remove an anti-tax shelter provision enacted in 1986. The change
would benefit only people who make more than $200,000 a year and
invest in low-income rental housing.

   The desert site where up
to 500,000 people have cheered past space shuttle landings will be
empty when Columbia returns to Earth, closed by the Air Force for
unexplained security reasons.
   The Department of Defense said the secrecy was necessary to ``to
limit an adversary's ability to determine the mission of a given
DOD shuttle flight.''
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said Wednesday that Columbia's
crew deployed an important satellite. He declined to elaborate, but
sources close to the project have said the 10-ton satellite is
designed to snap highly-detailed photographs of military targets
over a large area of the globe, including most of the Soviet Union.
   Officials declined to elaborate on how national security might
be harmed by opening the public viewing site for Columbia's
landing, scheduled for 9:37 EDT Sunday.
   ``I really don't know,'' said Don Haley, a civilian spokesman
for the Air Force at this Mojave Desert military base.
   The site is located 3{ miles from where the shuttle rolls to a
stop on dry lakebed runway 17. It drew 500,000 spectators when
Columbia was greeted by then-President and Mrs. Reagan on July 4,
1982. It has been closed during classified military shuttle
missions.
   While the public is barred, reporters, photographers and
television camera operators will be allowed to watch and record
Columbia's landing from a media site about 2 miles from the
shuttle's stopping point.
   ``It's crazy. The Air Force likes to play I've-got-a-secret. It
makes them feel more important,'' said John Pike, space policy
analyst for the Federation of American Scientists.
   Pike said during a telephone interview from Washington that he
understands Columbia's payload was a modified version of the KH-12
photoreconnaissance satellite.
   Secrecy surrounding the shuttle ``is not protecting this mission
from the Russians. It's protecting this mission from the American
taxpayers,'' he said.
   Capt. Marty Hauser, a Pentagon spokesman, disagreed.
   Hauser said Pentagon officials ``feel we do a good job of
keeping the public informed through the media and Congress. ... We
have a very effective way of reporting on the programs we have to
the House and Senate select intelligence committees.''

   The agreement by Central
American presidents to disband U.S.-supported Nicaraguan rebels has
raised hopes and added momentum to the quest for peace in the
region after a decade of conflict.
   ``We Central American presidents have taken the destiny of
Central America in our own hands,'' said Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias after the accords were signed Aug. 7 in the Honduran
port of Tela.
   The presidents of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador
and Guatemala have committed themselves to disband the 11,000
Contra rebels camped in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border by
early December.
   The deal was sealed after the others apparently concluded
Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega was genuinely moving towards a
fair election, as he had promised so many times in the past.
   Although Central American deadlines have not often been honored,
the end of the eight-year-old Nicaraguan war seems to be in sight.
   The presidents widened the spotlight to include El Salvador. The
outlook remains problematic, but the call for a cease-fire and
democratic guarantees has provided the best opportunity in years
for progress towards ending a conflict that began in 1980.
   The Bush administration said the Contras should not be disbanded
until after Nicaragua's presidential vote, set for Feb. 25, 1990,
in order to keep the heat on the leftist Sandinista government.
   But after eight years of fighting the U.S. position appeared
sterile. Congress has been unwilling to approve military aid that
would restore the Contras as an effective force.
   El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica receive hundreds of
millions of dollars in aid from the United States, but sources at
the talks said the Central Americans concluded relations would not
be hurt by a decision to disband the Contras _ something that
appeared inevitable in any case.
   Besides, Nicaragua was seen as moving towards an accommodation
with its domestic opposition. Just before the summit, Ortega
obtained an agreement in which the opposition joined a call for the
Contras' demise in return for promises of electoral reform.
   The move made Ortega's promises of democratization more
credible, and Ortega sweetened the deal for Honduras' Jose Azcona
Hoyo by agreeing to drop a world court suit against Honduras for
abetting subversion of another government.
   Emilio Alvarez Montalvan, a conservative Nicaraguan politician,
attributed the eased tensions to the superpower thaw and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of ``perestroika,'' or economic
and political restructuring.
   Like the Contras, Ortega has had to deal with reduced support
from his allies; on Thursday, a Soviet official told Costa Rica's
Arias that the Soviet Union will ship halt arms shipments to
Nicaragua as a contributioon to the peace process.
   ``Neither side is interested in using Third World conflicts to
get at the other any more,'' Montalvan said.
   Guillermo Ungo, El Salvador's most prominent leftist politician,
noted that three presidents _ Azcona, Arias and Vinicio Cerezo of
Guatemala _ are near the ends of their terms.
   ``They wanted to go down on the record as having achieved
something concretely positive for regional peace,'' said Ungo, who
finished a poor third to President Alfredo Cristiani in El
Salvador's voting earlier this year.
   Ungo predicted Washington ``will continue trying to block
implementation of the Tela accords.'' But President Bush will face
a fight in Congress if he tries to extend even non-lethal aid to
the Contras in the face of Central American political agreements.
   The Sandinistas' popularity has been hurt by an economy that is
on its way to becoming the hemisphere's worst. The government
blames it on the war and a U.S. embargo. The opposition blames it
on rigid economic policies.
   Even so, the Sandinistas are still favored in 1990, and Ortega
has improved his odds by suspending the draft. With the Contras
fading, the political benefits outweighed the military need,
although occasional fighting continues in the countryside.
   The Sandinistas also have agreed to free certain political
prisoners, reopen a television channel for the opposition, allow
United Nations election observers and yield power immediately if
the opposition wins.
   Once the rebels are disbanded, the Tela accord calls for a
wide-ranging, unconditional amnesty. The Contra leadership has been
reported divided over whether to return to Nicaragua; some fear the
fighters themselves, largely poor agricultural workers, will not
want to lay down their arms.
   While the opposition is looking for more concessions, the
business of politics has begun to pick up steam in Nicaragua.
   The Supreme Electoral Council estimates 1.8 million Nicaraguans
will register. The opposition newspaper La Prensa expressed concern
about fraud, but added ``the Sandinistas have absolutely renounced
their `historic project,' which involved holding on to power in
order to install a dictatorship.''
   The Tela accords, in addition to demobilization of the Contras,
call for an end to the Salvadoran war and incorporation of the
rebels into the democratic process.
   Both the government and the rebels hailed the accords and see
improved chances for discussing peace, although there was no
requirement and no verification or enforcement provision, as there
is at the Nicaraguan end.
   The consensus among Salvadoran politicians is that resolution of
the ``Contra question'' in and of itself benefits El Salvador by
giving it attention previously monopolized by Nicaragua.
   Ortega agreed not to aid the rebels, but Salvadorans remain
skeptical about that.
   Although the two sides are far apart, the war has been going on
for even longer than Nicaragua's, without a decisive outcome. Mere
fatigue may be enough to push the sides into taking advantage of
the Tela opening.

   A fire broke out aboard a cruise ship
after it collided with a pier while docking Saturday, but all 45
passengers were evacuated safely, harbor authorities said.
   The ship developed engine trouble when it tried to dock in heavy
winds, a harbor official on this Aegean island said.
   The wind pushed the 1,500-ton Zeus II against one of the piers,
cracking its stern. Minutes later, a fire broke out in the engine
room.
   The fire was quickly extinguished, and there was no significant
damage to the engine room, said the harbor official in a telephone
interview.
   The passengers, mostly Belgian, Dutch and German, were ``quickly
and safely evacuated,'' said the official. Harbor authorities were
inspecting the damage to see whether the ship could continue its
cruise of the Dodecanese islands.

   For 10 years, Gilbert Ridley and his wife were
the only blacks in their Presbyterian church in Bucks County, Pa.
   Now Ridley drives 15 miles every Sunday to a small, all-black
church he attended years ago.
   ``When you're black, your life experience makes you want a
little different format,'' he says.
   So did the Rev. George A. Stallings Jr., a black priest who has
been suspended by the Roman Catholic Church for forming the Imani
Temple, a breakaway black congregation in Washington.
   Unlike Stallings and his followers, Ridley and other blacks
interviewed at the National Urban League's annual conference are
not breaking away from their mostly Protestant churches.
   But their sympathies are with Stallings, who was suspended by
the Washington archdiocese after he said Mass in defiance of
Cardinal James A. Hickey on July 2. Stallings says the Catholic
Church has failed its nearly 2 million black parishioners. He has
accused the church of racism.
   ``We are excited to see him have such a following, because I
want to see people go back to church,'' Ridley said in an interview.
   John E. Jacob, president of the Urban League, told reporters,
``I believe it would be in the Catholic Church's interest to
understand what Father Stallings is saying.
   ``If they see the African American community as important for
inclusion in the church, then they have to have an appeal to that
community,'' Jacob said in a news conference Wednesday as the
four-day meeting ended. ``They have to understand that they are in
competition with traditional black churches.''
   Blacks and church officials agreed that mainline Protestant
churches have avoided the Imani Temple type of schism by allowing
flexibility to local congregations.
   ``I think most Protestant churches are far ahead of the Catholic
Church in terms of ritual,'' said the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery,
president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
pastor of the Cascade United Methodist Church in Atlanta.
   ``Local churches are free to use the guidelines just as
guidelines,'' Lowery said. For years, he said, he has used the
hymn, ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' a black favorite, as the
doxology in place of the traditional ``Praise God from Whom all
Blessings Flow.''
   Leonard Benton, president of the Urban League in Oklahoma City
and a Lutheran, said concerns of blacks and minorities were a major
issue in the merger of the American Lutheran Church, the
Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches and the Lutheran
Church in America to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, effective last year.
   Alice E. Carter, director of education for the Pittsburgh Urban
League and wife of a Lutheran minister, said the Lutheran church,
with its German and Scandinavian underpinnings, ``has been ethnic
ever since it was formed.''
   But, she said, it is paying more attention to minorities ``at
least in words and in policy; if this can be implemented, that will
be fine.'' The issue, known in the church as inclusiveness and
diversity, is expected to be debated again when the church's
National Assembly meets in Chicago Aug. 23-30.
   Mim Woolbert, a spokeswoman at the church's headquarters in
Chicago, said, ``As far as worship concerns, I think that is
getting to be answered in each local congregation in a different
way, depending on the situation.''
   At the national office of the United Methodist Church in
Louisville, Ky., Marj Carpenter, director of news services, said,
``We can look back at pictures of our general assemblies even 30
years ago, and it will be all white males sitting there.'' Now the
moderator, or titular head, of the church, is a black woman, the
Rev. Joan SamsonCampbell of Philadelphia.
   Still, Ms. Carpenter said, blacks ``monitor us very closely ...
they call our hands quickly if we are not paying attention to their
concerns.''
   Dean F. Dale, a delegate from the Louisville Urban League who
described herself as a lifelong Baptist, said, ``I don't think
there is a trend to set up separate churches and that sort of thing
because I don't think that would solve anything. ``I think it's
just a matter of people coming together and talking through their
differences.''
   At the same time, she said, she could understand the frustration
that led Stallings to form the breakaway church.
   Ridley, minority affairs coordinator for Bucks County Community
College in Newtown, Pa., said he was not unhappy at the nearly
all-white church that he and his wife attended, where he had held a
number of church offices, but felt he could be more useful by
rejoining the all-black congregation. He said the pastor of the
larger church supported his decision to resign and be ``our
missionary'' to the smaller congregation.
   In his new church, he said, he is rediscovering the emotional
climate of black worship.
   ``I have contact again with the old black matriarchs,'' he said.
``They are beautiful. They are something you miss. And the kids.
They do their bit in the service. Tears come into your eyes when
you see them in their blue pants and blue skirts and white shirts.
They read the scripture, they do everything. I had gotten away from
all that.
   ``In a black church, you have to be very, very basic,'' he said.
``Black folks have to feel it, and if you don't make it so you can
feel it, you get bored, so you say, `Why go?'''

<TEXT>
   In the dusty, fly-ridden food bazaars
of Kabul, astute merchants check to see if roads are open or if
Moslem rebels have closed them before setting the price of rice,
flour and other staples.
   During the past month, the Logar Road, the main route to
transport grain and produce from Pakistan, has been closed. The
other key road to Pakistan, which runs southeast through the city
of Jalalabad, has been closed intermittently, though the government
has gotten convoys through guerrilla lines under military escort.
   For most of the 2.25 million Afghans living in this mile-high
capital and facing almost daily rocket attacks by the rebels, the
result of the road closures has been a sharp increase in prices on
the open market, especially for flour used to make the traditional
Afghan flat bread called ``nan.''
   ``People are not happy,'' said Gul Mohammad, a bearded trader
selling 7-pound sacks of flour at a market in western Kabul. ``They
are very hungry now because food is too expensive.''
   The U.S.-backed guerrillas, who are based in Pakistan, say
soaring prices are exactly what they want.
   Abdul Sera of the fundamentalist Hezb-e-islami Khalist group
said the guerrilla strategy is to put pressure on the capital and
force residents to evacuate, thus paving the way for attacks on the
city and the ouster of the Soviet-supported government of President
Najib.
   ``We want to make it so expensive that people leave Kabul,''
Sera told The Associated Press in Islamabad, Pakistan. ``They are
facing a big shortage of food.''
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the fundamentalist
Jamiat-e-islami group, said rebel factions must develop a
coordinated plan to cut all roads around Kabul in order to conquer
the city.
   ``We must have total blockage,'' he told a Western journalist
last week in Peshawar, Pakistan.
   An average Afghan worker earns about 3,500 afghanis a month, now
worth less than $10. U.N. officials estimate prices have gone up
200 percent since Jan. 1.
   The closure of the Logar Road has made things worse: the price
of a 7-pound sack of flour in Kabul has risen from $1.72 on July 4
to $2.43 last week _ 27 percent of a typical worker's monthly
salary. Meanwhile, the cost of one nan has jumped from 1{ cents to
3.6 cents.
   U.N. sources say that in recent weeks they have seen many Kabul
residents migrating north, where there are fewer rocket attacks and
food is more plentiful and cheaper.
   ``I can say all people are facing malnutrition. All they have is
one piece of bread and tea three times a day,'' said Mohammad Shah,
a 33-year-old academic. ``I don't know how we survive .... If the
roads are blocked, we will die of hunger.''
   On a recent weekend, more than 100 trucks were lined up outside
Kabul's main silo waiting to unload grain, but it was not for
immediate consumption. The government is replenishing its grain
reserves to avoid a repetition of last winter's severe shortages.
   This grain shipment from the Soviet Union was transported down
the Salang Highway without apparent difficulty.
   Brian Stockwell of the World Food Program said the Afghan
government has reported the silo now holds about 20,000 metric tons
of grain, up from just under 8,000 metric tons two weeks ago. A
metric ton is equivalent to 2,205 pounds or 1.1 short tons.
   While the silo has a capacity of 50,000 tons, the Ministry of
Light Industry and Food has said it can stockpile only about 40,000
tons for the winter, Stockwell said.
   That amount represents less than half the estimated 90,000 to
100,000 tons needed to get Kabul through the three worst winter
months, he said.
   It isn't clear yet where the rest will come from _ possibly the
United Nations or the Soviets. Negotiations with the Soviets are
under way in Moscow and Geneva, Stockwell said.
   In the past week, the silo has been a prime target of rocket
attacks. Many missed, but on one day, a rocket shattered windows
and caused other minor damage.
   Meanwhile, Kabul's residents remain preoccupied with finding
enough to eat.
   Shah said he couldn't afford rice: a 7-pound sack now costs
$4.62, a little less than half his monthly salary of $10.25.
   The biggest worry, however, is flour.
   ``An Afghan will be hungry unless he gets three nans every
day,'' said a Western relief expert. ``This is the mainstay of the
Afghan diet.''

   A man confessed he drove the family car
into the Detroit River, drowning his four children, to get ``rid of
his present burden,'' a detective testified at a court hearing.
   About 500 people gathered at a suburban Detroit church this
morning to pay their last respects to the four DeLisle children:
Brian, 8; Melissa, 4; Kadie, 2; and Emily, 10 months.
   Their father, Lawrence DeLisle, a 28-year-old tire store
manager, was ordered held without bond Friday on four counts of
first-degree murder and one of attempted murder.
   The Rev. Walter Ptak, assistant pastor at St. Alfred Roman
Catholic Church in Taylor, told mourners that losing the children
was painful for the community as well as the family.
   ``This tragedy touched us in a very profound way as death has
come so unnaturally and snatched from us these four children,''
Ptak said at the memorial service.
   DeLisle and his wife, Suzanne, 32, residents of the nearby
Detroit suburb of Lincoln Park, escaped from the sinking station
wagon in which DeLisle's father committed suicide 18 months earlier.
   The suspect first said a leg cramp caused him to jam the
accelerator pedal, powering the car through a barricade and into
the river. But on Thursday, he admitted the crash was deliberate,
said Detective Sgt. Daniel Galeski.
   Galeski testified that DeLisle told him he deliberately drove
into the river ``with the intent of getting rid of his present
burden, with the intent of getting rid of his wife and children.''
   When the detective finished testifying, DeLisle briefly
exchanged smiles with him.
   DeLisle remained silent during the 10-minute hearing.
Twenty-seventh District Judge Lawrence Emmert ordered him held
without bond until another court appearance next Thursday.
   First-degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in
prison without possibility of parole. Attempted murder has a
maximum sentence of life in prison.
   After the hearing, DeLisle's uncle, William DeLisle, said he
believes his nephew is innocent.
   The uncle said he spoke with his nephew just before Friday's
arraignment and the younger man repeated his claim the crash was
accidental.
   ``He told me he did not do this thing on purpose,'' the uncle
said. ``He did not want to kill his wife. He did not want to kill
his babies. I stand by what he said.
   ``I looked in the boy's eyes. He couldn't have done it.''
   He said his nephew asked how his wife was doing, and told him to
``Tell her I love her.''
   Mrs. DeLisle was not among about half a dozen family members in
the courtroom.
   The uncle said his nephew appeared to be mentally unbalanced and
unaware of his surroundings on Friday. Police told him his nephew
would undergo psychiatric examination, he said.
   Earlier this week, the uncle disclosed that DeLisle's father,
Richard DeLisle, shot himself to death in the same car 18 months
ago.
   Several family members tried to persuade DeLisle to get rid of
the car but his uncle said he urged his nephew to keep it because
``he needed the car and he didn't have a lot of money.''
   ``Everybody's going to say it's a jinxed car and we should have
gotten rid of it in the first place,'' the uncle said. ``But the
car didn't do this again.''

<TEXT>
   In what could be a sad epilogue to a tragic
love story, the balcony from which Juliet pledged her love to Romeo
appears to be falling apart.
   Newspapers reported Saturday that city authorities declared the
balcony dangerous and closed off an area underneath it after some
tourists were hit by falling pieces of wood and rock, apparently
broken loose by recent heavy rainfalls.
   Lanfranco Franzoni, director of Verona's museums, has said
``only a radical intervention can prevent the total collapse'' of
the balcony.
   City officials canceled a performance of ``Romeo and Juliet'' at
the site Friday night because of the precarious condition of the
balcony. After another examination of the balcony on Saturday, they
decided the production could continue. It closes for the season on
Tuesday night.
   Alessandro Borsatti, a member of the acting company, said some
changes had been made in the performance because of the damage but
the balcony was still considered safe for the actress who plays
Juliet.
   However, he said, instead of escaping from the balcony, Romeo
now will flee from an adjacent window.
   The balcony in Verona is a place of pilgrimage for Shakespeare
fans and for romantic souls.
   ``Juliet's house,'' a 13th-century building in the center of
town, used to be an inn called ``Il Cappello,'' or ``The Hat'' in
Italian. Its name sounded close enough to Juliet's family name,
Capulet, to identify it as the setting of Shakespeare's play.
   Stefania Corliano, a guide at the house, said the city's
architect supervised a group of masons Saturday who made minor
repairs to the balcony. She said the architect decided major
repairs could wait until the fall.
   Newspapers reported that time and weather were not alone in
causing decay of the balcony. Many of the 200,000 visitors who come
yearly to Verona to remember Romeo and Juliet try to break off a
piece as a souvenir for their beloved.

   Residents and officials frustrated by a
juvenile justice system they view as ineffective are welcoming an
ordinance threatening parents with two days in a stockade if their
children are caught out at night.
   ``I know what motivates people,'' said City Attorney Charles
Sidney Gibson. ``They want public approval. We sanitized crime and
punishment so much that we have removed the shame. People need to
see what happens when you don't conform to the law.''
   The City Council passed the ordinance Aug. 5 after a fight early
that day involving five people, some wielding broken bottles, and
about 250 onlookers. The ordinance calls for a written warning to
parents the first time a minor is found violating the new 11 p.m.
to 5:30 a.m. curfew. The second time, the ordinance says, they can
be fined up to $500 and jailed 30 days _ including up to two days
on public display in a stockade _ and have their picture run in the
local newspaper with the caption ``Irresponsible Parent.''
   There are snags: The paper says it hasn't decided whether to run
such pictures. The ordinance does not specify what it means by a
stockade. The town doesn't have one, and the council didn't vote to
build one.
   Supporters of the ordinance include Mike Brannon, owner of the
Dermott Pawn Shop. Though his business sits across the street from
the police department in this southeastern Arkansas community of
4,500, his front windows are protected with an iron grid after
several break-ins.
   ``How about this for a stockade?'' Brannon said from behind the
grid.
   He said the legal system doesn't deal effectively with juveniles.
   ``There's not a whole lot you can do about them,'' Brannon said.
``It's gotten to the point where there's no embarrassment or other
problems for them.''
   The juveniles arrested for breaking his windows and taking
merchandise were ordered to reimburse him, but haven't yet, he said.
   Police Chief Jerry Melton said that when he's had parents and
children in for conferences, other children waiting outside
sometimes have yelled, ``Don't tell them nothing. They can't send
us to jail.''
   The town's crime rate has tripled this summer mostly because of
juvenile troublemakers, he said.
   Melton, who heads a seven-officer police force, said the
ordinance already has shown its effectiveness.
   He said a parent who received a first warning told the chief to
expect a child abuse call, telling him: ``I'm going to whip this
child. I'm not going to jail for him.''
   Melton acknowledged that many of the children committing crimes
come from broken homes and are left alone by parents who must work.
But he added, ``It's good they've got a job, but it doesn't release
them from the responsibility of being a parent.''
   Whether or not sentencing parents to public display is
effective, it is clearly unconstitutional, according to Jay
Jacobson, executive director of the Arkansas chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Jacobson said he was sure someone would challenge the ordinance
in court, and ``there's no way it'll stand up.''
   Gibson disagreed, saying the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that
the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment is a
changing concept.
   James Lee of the state attorney general's office said the
penalties outlined in the Dermott ordinance are unprecedented but
that the idea behind them isn't.
   ``We have a parental liability law,'' Lee said. ``Every state
does. When a juvenile or incompetent person causes some sort of
damage, the responsibility is transferred to the parent or
guardian.''
   Emma Ware, one of three parents cited under the new ordinance,
said she supports it. Her 9-year-old son was caught bringing a gun
to a fight between three 13-year-old girls.
   ``The law ain't strict enough on the gangs and drugs and
things,'' she said.
   ``We had to do something to get tough,'' said Toni Scucchi, a
teacher at Dermott Elementary. ``I agree with it. It may sound
outlandish, but nothing has worked so far.''
   Dedgra Griffin, 20, believes the answer is to punish the
wrongdoers _ not the parents.
   ``Most of them have been in trouble before. If I were their
parents, I would let them take them away,'' she said. ``Lock the
kids up.''

<HEAD>Chinese May Succeed In Altering Memories of Tiananmen Square, Researcher
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Chinese government's campaign to distort
the truth about the Tiananmen Square massacre may seem futile, but
even eyewitnesses could one day believe they recall the fabricated
history, a memory expert says.
   ``All the right psychological high-tech ingredients are in place
for the lie to become truth, reason enough for us to be pessimistic
about the future of memories of Tiananmen Square,'' said Elizabeth
Loftus.
   ``The Chinese government is not the first set of leaders to try
to rewrite history. Their attempts at mental manipulation are only
the most radical in recent times.
   ``We should not be complacent in thinking they can't succeed.
Rather, we should worry about whose memory is next,'' she said.
   Loftus, of the University of Washington in Seattle, cited
research into manipulation of eyewitness memories in an address
Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
   Chinese authorities have been using memory-modifying techniques
to convince citizens that violence in the army's June 4 attack on
pro-democracy demonstrators was caused by rowdy civilian thugs, she
said.
   The tactics include repeated television images of soldiers being
attacked, she said. Workers, students, bureaucrats and party
members are exposed to twice-weekly ``seminars'' on the topic, and
make public pledges of allegiance to the party line, she said.
   ``People are particularly prone to having their memories
modified when the passage of time allows the original memory to
fade,'' Loftus said.
   ``In its weakened condition, memory, like the disease-ridden
body, becomes especially vulnerable to repeated assaults on its
very essence. We are especially susceptible if we can be induced
... to repeat the misinformation as fact.''
   The experiments in memory modification Loftus cited generally
shared a common strategy. People witnessed a crime, accident or
other incident, typically on film. Sometime later, they were tested
on their recall of the event.
   But some of the people were slipped fictitious details without
their realizing it, and they later recalled them as memory.
   In one experiment, subjects watched a film of an accident on a
country road. Later they were asked if they had seen a barn, which
in fact did not appear in the film.
   Researchers planted that idea of a barn in the minds of some
subjects by asking, ``How fast was the white sports car going when
it passed the barn?''
   Of the people who were asked that question, 17 percent later
declared they had seen a barn. Only about 3 percent of people who
had not been exposed to the leading question later said the film
had included a barn.
   In another experiment, up to 80 percent of misled witnesses
recalled planted information.
   People can be quite confident that they are truly remembering
planted details, Loftus said.
   ``People have recalled non-existent broken glass and tape
recorders, a clean-shaven man as having a mustache, straight hair
as curly,'' she said.
   In an interview, she acknowledged that the degree of memory
distortion achieved by such experiments is far less ambitious than
the goals she described for the Chinese government.
   But the Chinese leaders have advantages over experimenters like
herself, she said.
   ``They have forever to do it,'' she said. ``I have only one
hour. They have the resources and the opportunity to just hammer
away at this in ways we haven't even begun to try in experiments.
   ``We present information once or twice, and people grab onto it.
They can wait and let memories fade for a year. What's left, except
this germ of a recollection, into which you can insert ... new
ideas.''
   Not everyone in her audience agreed with Loftus about the
Chinese government's ability to alter memories.
   ``I'm not as pessimistic about the eyewitnesses,'' said Sam
Glucksberg, a psychology professor at Princeton University.
   ``A person who was right next to a person who was shot, I don't
think his memory of that can be significantly altered,'' Glucksberg
said. ``I don't think you can convince him he did not see that.''
   Glucksberg said the impact on memory Loftus described are real,
but that nobody knows how much memories can be changed.

<HEAD>Determination of Higgins' Death Up to Marine Corps Commandant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robin Higgins, in a moving salute to her
husband last week, spoke of the ``virtual certainty'' he'd been
killed at the hands of his Lebanese terrorist kidnappers.
   Mrs. Higgins made the announcement nearly 18 months after Lt.
Col. William Higgins was taken captive and following an exhaustive
FBI study of a videotape released by his kidnappers, which
purported to show Higgins' body, bound and gagged and hanging from
a makeshift gallows.
   But no corpse was made available to U.S. officials _ and a U.N.
official who traveled to Beirut to search for the body returned
empty-handed _ so it appears a formal declaration of death could be
some time coming.
   The problem is a familiar one to other U.S. military families
who struggled with uncertainty regarding the fate of their loved
ones.
   Since World War I, the Pentagon lists approximately 92,000
troops as missing in action. Much attention has been focused
recently on the 2,344 military personnel still unaccounted for from
the Vietnam War.
   ``It's a very difficult problem to deal with, emotionally and
legally,'' said Betsy Cox, spokeswoman for the National League of
Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia.
   ``This is a particularly tragic situation. It looks like Col.
Higgins was killed, but there's still that degree of doubt,'' said
Ms. Cox.
   The spokeswoman said Mrs. Higgins, herself a Marine major,
appeared at a recent event and sponsored by her organization and
attended by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``Maj. Higgins has been very supportive of our group throughout
her ordeal. ... I can see where she would gain some comfort from
being with POW@MIA (prisoner of war, missing in action) families,''
Ms. Cox said.
   Even when there is a formal declaration of death of a loved one
who has been missing, sometimes family members cling to the chance
a mistake has been made, said Carmella LaSpada, a spokeswoman for a
No Greater Love, a support organization for families of missing
soldiers.
   ``Hope is a cheater. If no one knows for sure, it's always very
distressing for the family,'' she said.
   Lt. Col. Fred Peck, a Marine Corps spokesman, said the decision
to declare a serviceman or woman dead is up to the service
secretary. In Higgins' case, it has been delegated to Gen. Alfred
M. Gray, the commandant of the Marine Corps.
   Gray ``has taken a close personal interest'' in the case and
``has taken Robin under his wing,'' said Peck.
   But before making any decision, Gray has indicated more work
needs to be done, Peck said.
   The commandant, who personally informed Mrs. Higgins of the gist
of the FBI's report, has asked to see the bureau's complete written
study, and has requested a personal briefing as well.
   Gray intends to speak with the U.N. official who traveled in
search of Higgins body, Marrack Goulding, and also meet with the
Marine Corps' lawyers about the case.
   ``He also intends to speak with Robin again. There is nothing
compelling him to arrive at a decision at any specified time,''
Peck said.
   No plans have been made for any memorial service, he added.
   ``We really don't know when the situation will change.
Bascially, it's open-ended for now,'' Peck said.
   There is a formal process under which a formal declaration of
death is made and the families concerned are invited to participate
in _ or contest _ the process, Peck said.
   Each is handled on a case-by-case basis, he said.
   Up until a declaration is made, the surviving spouse continues
to draw the full pay and allowances due the serviceman or woman.
When the declaration is made, the pay stops and ``the account is
settled,'' Peck said.
   That includes such things as life insurance payments _ most
servicemen carry the $50,000 group life insurance policy that
Higgins had _ payment for any leave accrued, and payment of
survivor's benefits of approximately $1,000 a month for life,
unless the spouse decides to remarry, Peck said.
   Mrs. Higgins hasn't ever mentioned the financial aspects of her
husbands'situation, the spokesman said.
   ``That's been the least of her worries,'' he said.

   ``Please deposit 10 cents for the next five
minutes, or your call will be interrupted.''
   Clink!
   ``Thank you.''
   No _ thank YOU, William Gray. One hundred years ago this Sunday,
the 37-year-old Gray obtained U.S. Patent No. 408,709 for his
invention, ``A Coin-Controlled Apparatus for Telephones'' _ the
public pay phone.
   The first one was installed months later at the Hartford Bank in
Hartford, Conn. A hundred years later, there are 2 million pay
phones across the United States _ enough to give one to every man,
woman and child in West Virginia.
   Gray's inspiration came of necessity: His foreman at a
Connecticut factory had refused him permission to use the telephone
to call his sick wife, even when he offered to pay for the call.
   Not everyone was convinced that the pay phone would be a winner;
when busy Grand Central Terminal placed its first order, it
installed just one.
   Now, they are everywhere. There are pay phones at the White
House, in the middle of Death Valley, in the El Salvadoran jungle,
even on the Empress Lilly paddleboat on Pleasure Island at Disney
World.
   The price has changed _ it was a nickel for 59 years, until it
rose to a dime in 1948. Now, the tariff ranges from a dime to a
quarter in the United States, and from a penny (in Spain) to 77
cents (in France) overseas.
   The folks at Intellicall, a manufacturer of private pay phones,
have put together a package of fun facts to mark the 100th
anniversary. To wit:
   _The ``Jamestown'' booth, manufactured in Jamestown, N.Y., in
the late 1800s, featured wood finishing, silk curtains and
multipaneled windows. It was placed in hotel lobbies; patrons would
sometimes wait in front of it, believing that it was an elevator.
   _The first outdoor phone booth was installed in Cincinnati in
1905.
   _The use of slugs cost New York Telephone $317,370 in 1935. In
the 1930s and 1940s, string cutters were added to pay phones to
frustrate thieves who would attach strings to coins so they could
be retrieved.
   _Gray, the pay telephone's inventor, had another moment in the
sun. He also invented an inflatable chest protector for baseball
catchers.
   Idaho has the best pay-phone ratio for its population _ 10 for
every 1,000 people. Texas ...
   ``Please deposit 10 cents for the next five minutes, or your
call will be interrupted.''
   ... has the worst _ one for every 1,000 Texans. The first phone
booth with a double-hinged door was installed in 1910. Clark Kent
first used a phone booth to change into Superman in the
September-October 1949 issue of D.C. Comics. ``Drive-up'' pay
telephone service was first tested in ....

<HEAD>Toledo Civil Rights Leaders Still at Odds With City</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a Monday morning when most people were
returning to work, the Rev. Floyd Rose and his supporters gathered
at the Ottawa River to remember a 16-year-old black teen-ager who
drowned in the muddy water.
   ``He did not have to die,'' Rose, pastor of the Family Baptist
Church, said after Robert Thomas' mother, Diane, placed a wreath in
the water where her son died. His death has sparked a new wave of
civil rights demonstrations in this northwestern Ohio city.
   Thomas, who was described as afraid of water, drowned July 26
after he jumped into the river while being chased by a white
University of Toledo police officer.
   The prayer vigil Aug. 7 attracted 100 people who were outraged
because there was about an hour's delay before fire division water
rescue workers were contacted to begin a search for the boy.
   Rose, the most visible of Toledo's civil rights leaders,
promises to keep the pressure on city officials until questions
surrounding the boy's death are answered. Police and fire officials
say proper procedures were followed, but refuse to comment further
while the investigation is pending.
   ``The city always takes the African-American community for
fools,'' Rose said. ``Had they told us that there was a breakdown
in communication by the police and fire departments and apologized
for the error, we would have understood.
   ``But the city never apologized to anyone. Instead, they said
everyone followed proper procedures and tried to say Robert was a
criminal, even though he wasn't charged with anything. Instead of
being conciliatory, they have been arrogant.
   ``We've backed down before, but not this time.''
   About 17 percent of the city's 340,000 residents are black.
   City leaders, led by Mayor Donna Owens, have tried to meet with
Rose and several other key activists to defuse the unrest, but
those efforts have been rebuffed.
   ``Every time the city wants something from us they call a
meeting,'' Rose said. ``But when we try to discuss problems facing
the city _ our concerns _ they claim we're being unreasonable.''
   Ms. Owens said the point of meeting is to move beyond rhetoric
and start dealing with issues.
   ``I think it's time that Rose and everyone else starts
considering the safety and concerns of all of our citizens in this
community and that we work together in building positive
relationships,'' she said.
   Since the early 1970s, an advocacy group has been monitoring the
hiring practices of the city's police and fire departments, which
are under federal court order to hire more minorities.
   Racial tensions flared in June 1988 after City Manager Philip
Hawkey, who is white, dismissed one black official and suspended
two other blacks he accused of mismanaging the city's housing
programs.
   After public hearings late last year, the Ohio Civil Rights
Commission and the city signed an agreement July 28 that Toledo
will hire and promote more minorities and women. A report on
Toledo's race relations is pending from the Ohio Advisory Committee
to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, also as a result of those
hearings.
   In March, controversy over sexist and racist remarks allegedly
made by Fire Chief William Winkle brought many white leaders into
the movement.
   Winkle was suspended for 20 days for making a sexist remark
about a female city employee. Later, the city released a 1982
report that said firefighters heard Winkle praise Adolf Hitler and
support lynching blacks.
   Winkle rarely talks publicly about the allegations, which he has
denied. He did not return a telephone message last week seeking
additional comment.
   ``A lot of the prejudice is intangible,'' Rose said. ``The kind
of prejudice in Toledo isn't like the segregation in the South.
Many people in the white community couldn't put their fingers on
why we felt the way we did. Then they saw Winkle, his attitude and
the city's unwillingness to take any action. Now they know.''
   Thomas' drowning opened new wounds. Authorities say he jumped
into the river to elude officers pursuing him and three others
suspected of trying to steal several cases of soda from a
convenience store near the University of Toledo. The other suspects
were not apprehended.
   Rose said if Thomas had been white, rescuers would have been
sent much sooner.
   The FBI is investigating whether Thomas' civil rights were
violated before he jumped in the rain-swollen river.
   Hawkey said a report on the incident should be complete soon. He
said police and fire personnel followed procedures.
   Councilman Jack Ford, who is black, said the drowning made more
people aware of racial tension in the city.
   ``I suspect the death of the young man not only has brought
concern in the black community, but in the greater community,'' he
said. ``I think there's going to be some deep changes that have to
be made very quickly for it to be turned around.''

<HEAD>Search Fails to Find Congressional Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supported by U.S. helicopters and
more manpower, searchers stepped up the hunt Saturday for Rep.
Mickey Leland and his delegation. But a fifth day passed with no
sign of the party's downed plane.
   Four U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters joined the growing fleet of
American and Ethiopian aircraft looking for Leland, D-Texas, and 15
others, missing since Monday when their twin-engine airplane
disappeared on a flight to a refugee camp.
   The Blackhawks, ferried across the Atlantic from Eglin Air Force
Base in Florida by a C-5 cargo plane, were assembled in Addis Ababa
on Friday and took to the air at dawn, joining more than a dozen
other aircraft.
   John Guerra, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, said
three more C-130 Hercules cargo planes were to arrive Sunday,
supplementing two already taking part in the search that began
Tuesday.
   The helicopters were dispatched to Ethiopia before Leland's
press secretary in Washington criticized the search effort Friday
as lacking ``a sense of urgency.''
   ``There's an obvious leadership or organizational vacuum here,''
Leland's spokeswoman, Alma Newsom, told a news conference. ``We
could have and should have located them by now.''
   But weary officials in Ethiopia's capital defended their efforts.
   ``We feel we have adequate resources,'' said Guerra. ``However,
if the requirements of the operation increase, we are prepared to
increase both the equipment and the manpower.''
   The twin-engine Twin Otter disappeared Monday on a flight from
Addis Ababa to the Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles to the southwest
near the Sudanese border. Leland, chairman of the House Select
Committee on Hunger, was one of nine Americans aboard the flight.
   Earlier this week, weather satellites detected what appeared to
be distress signals from aircraft in two areas outside the Leland
plane's intended flight path, but nothing was found when rescuers
searched those areas.
   The C-130s due to arrive Sunday were bringing crews to spell the
fliers of the first two Hercules, who have been in the air from
sunup to sundown each day since their arrival on an overnight
flight from West Germany on Tuesday.
   Guerra described as ``superb'' the cooperation of the
Ethiopians, with whom the United States has had chilly relations
since a Marxist government came to power in a 1974 coup.
   ``The Ethiopians have put up to 10 aircraft up in a day,'' he
said. ``You got a heck of a lot of people out there looking for the
missing aircraft. We've got the local authorities also helping on
the ground.''
   The government in Addis Ababa has allowed an American U2, a
high-altitude reconnaisance craft commonly used for spy missions,
to make daily passes over its territory, taking high-resolution
photographs of the search area.
   ``I think there is an honest difference of opinion among people
equally committed to finding the aircraft,'' said James Haley, the
embassy's chief spokesman. ``Rescue people here are deciding on
what they consider adequate resources.''
   Two of Leland's colleagues, Reps. Gary Ackerman and Al Wheat,
flew in the fleet of four Blackhawks that spent the day scouring
the first 100 miles of the intended flight path of downed plane.
The two C-130s and a number of Ethiopian planes covered the
remainder of the path.
   Ackerman, a member of Leland's committee, and Wheat, who belongs
to the Congressional Black Caucus, were sent to Ethiopia by House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley to represent the lower chamber.
   Leland has made six trips to Ethiopia, the last one just last
March. As chairman of the select committee, he long has expressed
intense interest in the problems of Africa's displaced and hungry.
   The Fugnido camp is one of four camps in southwestern Ethiopia
run by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. It houses more than
300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in their
neighboring country.
   The eight other Americans traveling with Leland included three
members of his staff, a friend of the congressman, three officers
from the U.S. Agency for International Development and the spouse
of one of the AID officials. Also aboard were an Ethiopian employee
of the U.S. Embassy, three Ethiopian officials and a crew of three.

   About 200 people chanting ``drug dealers got to
go'' followed the hearse of a slain anti-drug activist this morning
through the Brooklyn neighborhood she tried to make safer for her
family.
   The two-mile procession followed a funeral Mass at which Maria
Hernandez, 34, was praised for her courage.
   ``She, with her family, attempted to create a place where all of
us may be able to live with dignity. And then that dream and that
vision was tragically and dramatically shattered,'' said the Rev.
Charles Ploch.
   Three mayoral candidates joined those who packed St. John the
Baptist Church for the funeral. Carlos Hernandez, who received a
death threat during his wife's wake on Friday, was in the front of
the church with two of the couple's three children.
   Mrs. Hernandez was shot Tuesday by a gunman who fired at least
five bullets into her family's apartment. She died six hours later.
   She and her husband had confronted drug dealers in their
neighborhood, and the killing is seen in the community as
retaliation for their efforts. Hernandez has vowed to continue the
fight.
   ``Those most important to the elimination of the drug scourge
are people like Maria and Carlos Hernandez,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch
said. ``The rest of this city should stand up and say to them, `You
are not alone.'''
   After the funeral, Koch's leading challenger in November's
election, David Dinkins, and about two dozen Guardian Angels joined
the group marching to Cypress Hills Cemetery for Mrs. Hernandez's
burial.
   On Friday, a wake for Mrs. Hernandez was interrupted when
someone called in a bomb threat at a Brooklyn funeral home.
   Police said a small number of mourners were evacuated while
bomb-sniffing dogs went through the home, but nothing was found.
   Mrs. Hernandez's husband had not yet arrived at the home when
the search took place, said a funeral home spokesman.
   Services resumed after police found no evidence of a bomb, Burns
said.
   Police, meanwhile, are investigating a feud between the
Hernandezes and their next-door neighbors.
   A grand jury Thursday indicted one of the neighbors, Raymond
Gonzalez, 42, who last month allegedly stabbed Hernandez after the
Hernandezes accused him of selling cocaine in front of their house.
He is also accused of threatening Hernandez with an Uzi submachine
gun.
   Gonzalez was arrested for both incidents on Aug. 4 and was in
jail when Mrs. Hernandez was killed, police said.

<HEAD>President Awaits Soviet Response on Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a statement Saturday
marking the 28th anniversary of the Berlin Wall, said he hoped for
a positive Soviet response to make Berlin ``a place of cooperation,
not a point of confrontation.''
   ``We observe this sad anniversary with renewed determination to
overcome the division of Berlin and of Europe,'' Bush said in the
statement from Camp David, Md. He called the wall, built in 1961 by
the East Germans to stem the exodus of its citizens, the ``relic of
a bygone era and a failed policy.''
   Bush, during a May trip to West Germany in May, told a cheering
crowd it was time to make Europe ``whole and free'' and called on
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to open up ``the rusting Iron
Curtain.''
   ``As I said in Mainz on May 31, we want Berlin to be a place of
cooperation, not a point of confrontation,'' Bush's statement
Saturday said. ``We have asked the Soviet Union, as part of its
four-party responsibilities for Berlin, to join us in achieving
these goals. We still await what we hope will be a positive
response.''
   He called the people of West Berlin ``courageous,'' saying they
``tend the precious fire of freedom as a example for us all.''
   Bush repeated the U.S. commitment ``to improving the lives of
Berliners and to bringing closer the day when the city is again
united,'' adding: ``Together with our British and French allies, we
have put forward an initiative to make such progress a reality.''

<HEAD>Polish Prime Minister Calls For Meeting With Walesa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak, whose
efforts to form a Cabinet have been opposed by Solidarity, called
Saturday for a meeting with Lech Walesa to discuss the standoff and
the concerns it has raised in the Soviet Union.
   In an interview published by the official PAP news agency,
Kiszczak said Poland ``simply cannot afford a protracted impasse.''
   Kiszczak also said two small Communist-aligned political parties
that have entered into negotiations with officials of the
Solidarity movement should remain loyal to the Communist Party.
   Kiszczak's public appeal for a meeting appeared to indicate a
decision by communist authorities that the time has come to end the
political jockeying and hammer out an agreement with Solidarity on
the form of the next government.
   Walesa announced Monday he would oppose any Cabinet assembled by
Kiszczak. The Solidarity leader has been trying to forge alliances
with the two minor parties, who hold the parliamentary power
balance, in order to form a Solidarity-led government in the Soviet
Union's largest East bloc ally.
   Talks between Solidarity and the minor parties, the United
Peasants and the Democrats, began Thursday.
   A spokesman for Walesa, Janusz Paczek, said Saturday he was not
sure if Walesa was aware of Kiszczak's call for a meeting. Walesa
was unavailable for comment, and Paczek said no meeting would take
place before Monday.
   In the year since Communist authorities resumed dialogue with
Solidarity, meetings between Walesa and Kiszczak at various
government villas around Warsaw were the scene of key compromises.
Such meetings took place before and during the ``round table''
talks that led to legalizing the union, rewriting the constitution
and admitting the opposition to parliament.
   Given the opposition's overwhelming victories in June elections,
both opposition and Communist politicians have argued that
Solidarity's endorsement is required for the next government to
have public support.
   The Soviet Union has expressed impatience with the political
situation, and the Soviet ambassador to Poland met Friday with
Kiszczak and with United Peasant chairman Roman Malinowski and
Democratic chairman Jerzy Jozwiak.
   The discussions with the party chairmen, PAP said, concerned the
progress of reforms and establishing direct links between the minor
parties and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry official in Moscow on Friday
criticized attempts to use the formation of the Polish government
``for destabilizing the situation in the country,'' according to
the Tass news agency.
   The official, First Deputy Vadim Perfiliev, did not mention
Solidarity by name, but the Polish Communist Party leadership also
has referred to Walesa's bid as destabilizing.
   Perfiliev said that any attempts to undermine the country's
stability and willingness to carry out its agreements under the
Warsaw Pact military alliance ``would not promote the interests of
stability in Europe.''
   In the interview, Kiszczak was asked about Walesa's bid to form
a government in place of him.
   ``I would not treat the failure of Kiszczak's mission as a
personal tragedy,'' he said. ``However, this is not exclusively my
personal matter. That is why I would not be able to neglect the
effects of a government crisis.''
   He said he has been ``unable'' to arrange substantive talks with
Walesa since being named prime minister Aug. 2. ``I would like such
a talk to take place as soon as possible,'' he said.
   Kiszczak said the Peasant and Democratic parties owe loyalty to
his communist Polish United Workers Party.
   ``In politics, delivering on agreements and loyalty should be
values that are respected,'' Kiszczak said. ``The political
contract reached at the `round table' guaranteed the vital
political interests'' of the two parties.
   Noting the Peasants and the Democrats owe the number of seats
they have in parliament to a deal made with the Communist Party,
and that the parties entered elections as communist allies, he
said: ``I think this ... obliges one.''
   Kiszczak, who said he hopes to present his Cabinet for approval
by the parliament in late August, stressed he has not given up on
the idea of forming a government that would have both the
opposition and communists in it.
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, Solidarity lawmakers ``reject direct
participation in the government.''
   But he added, ``I am not giving up hope that the supreme reasons
will prevail after all and a chance will surface for the formation
of agovernment of national agreement. The offer still stands.''

<TEXT>
   The Columbia astronauts tested the
shuttle's flight control systems on their last full day in orbit as
they prepared to end their secret military mission with a morning
landing Sunday in a California desert.
   NASA briefly broke a Pentagon-imposed news blackout Saturday to
announce that Columbia would land at Edwards Air Force Base,
Calif., at 9:37 a.m. EDT. The space agency previously had said only
that the shuttle would land sometime between 9 a.m. and noon Sunday.
   ``The crew is doing well and is beginning landing
preparations,'' a NASA statement said. The announcement was one of
just a few made this week about the semisecret mission.
   Sunday's weather forecast called for excellent landing
conditions at Edwards. Skies were to be partly cloudy and
temperatures were expected to range from 68 degrees just after
sunrise to a midday high of 97 degrees.
   Although hundreds of thousands of people have flocked to the Air
Force base to watch previous shuttles land in the Mojave Desert,
Sunday's touchdown will be closed to the public because of the
classified nature of the flight.
   The planned private landing was a fitting finale to the flight,
which has been cloaked in secrecy from the start. The news blackout
was imposed by the Department of Defense, which wants to keep the
mission's activities a secret.
   To prepare for the trip back to Earth, Columbia commander
Brewster Shaw and pilot Richard Richards were running through a
series of tests Saturday to make certain the shuttle's computers
and control jets were ready.
   In addition, mission specialists David Leestma, James Adamson
and Mark Brown were packing up the experiments. Some of those tests
were believed to be connected with the ``Star Wars'' missile
defense project, while others involved determining how people can
serve as military observers from space.
   During their mission, the five military men also reportedly
monitored military tactical and strategic targets on Earth.
   The main goal of the flight was widely believed to be the
deployment of a sophisticated, 10-ton spy satellite that is
designed to snap highly detailed photographs over a wide area of
the globe, including most of the Soviet Union.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice confirmed Wednesday that a
satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in
orbit, but he wouldn't discuss its purpose.

<HEAD>Report Says ANC Leader Oliver Tambo Suffered a Stroke</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 5 grafs with background at end. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver Tambo, president of the African National
Congress, suffered a stroke in Zambia and was flown to London for
treatment, sources in the organization were quoted as saying
Saturday.
   A spokesman for the British company Lonrho PLC said Tambo was
flown to London on a company plane but would not say which hospital
was treating the 71-year-old black nationalist leader or describe
his condition.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted
sources in the African National Congress as saying Tambo was
stricken Wednesday and flown to London Friday for treatment at a
private hospital.
   They were quoted as saying he was absent during a summit in
Zambia Thursday involving the presidents of Angola, Botswana,
Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and leaders of the ANC,
the largest guerrilla organization fighting the white-run
government in South Africa.
   The British Foreign Office could not immediately confirm the
report.
   The Lonrho spokesman, speaking anonymously, said the aircraft
had been in Lusaka for another reason and that action had been
taken to help Tambo after a request ``from African governments.''
   The Lonhro spokesman said he did not know how long Tambo would
be in Britain or whether the company would provide him with a
flight back to Zambia.
   Of the decision to use the Lonhro plane, he said:
   ``There was no hesitation. It was a matter of some considerable
concern that he should be got back to Britain as soon as possible.
The plane was coming in this direction anyway.''
   Tambo, leader of the ANC since 1967, has been in exile since
South Africa banned the organization in 1960.
   His longtime friend and jailed former ANC partner Nelson Mandela
said in a note from prison in 1985: ``Oliver Tambo is much more
than a brother to me. He is my greatest friend and comrade for
nearly 50 years.''
   Tambo is believed to command wide respect from others in the
ANC's exiled leadership, but there are persistent reports that two
factions will vie for power once he is gone.
   A more militant faction, headed by ANC military chief of staff
Chris Hani, has favored continuing or escalating sabotage and
bombings in South Africa, including attacks on civilian targets.
   The more moderate faction, favoring diplomacy, is led by Thabo
Mbeki, the ANC's foreign affairs secretary, who has been mentioned
frequently as a likely successor to Tambo.

<HEAD>World's Biggest Arts Festival Ponders Future in 43rd Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flags are flying in Princes
Street and the capital is bustling with the first of 250,000
visitors to the world's biggest arts extravaganza beginning Sunday.
   But as the three-week Edinburgh Festival of music, theater and
dance opens, organizers are asking what the future holds for the
43-year-old chronically underfunded event.
   A policy committee has been set up for the first time to discuss
wider issues than what shows to put on, including the festival's
direction in the next 10 years, said Frank Dunlop, festival
director for the last seven years.
   ``It seems to me that unless it can be creatively expanded and
look at itself afresh, it will become moribund,'' he said in an
interview, adding, ``I don't think I'm becoming moribund, although
some might think I am.''
   Dunlop is a short, stocky, gray-bearded Englishman, the son of a
Polish-Latvian shoemaker's daughter and a Scottish engineer.
   He was associate director of the National Theater under Laurence
Olivier, founded the Young Vic youth theater and worked in New York
as a successful director.
   He searches constantly for unexpected delights for the festival,
including in other years a hilarious Canadian comedy about old
movies and a Japanese ``Macbeth'' performed in white body stockings.
   This year has much that is Spanish _ Spanish opera, puppets,
ballet, theater and the National Orchestra of Spain.
   Dunlop said he hadn't had time to read one prominent London
newspaper article suggesting he is ready to quit because he was
dispirited about the future of the festival.
   Money is a continual problem. The Edinburgh Festival has always
been underfunded and the city fathers never built the opera house
that was pledged after World War II.
   ``I spend more time appealing for money than anything else,''
says Dunlop. ``The festival is costing $4.8 million this year, and
we should be spending $6.4 million.''
   Festival visitors will spend at least $64 million in the next
three weeks, but the city _ especially its businesses _ is
notoriously parsimonious, he said.
   Local authorities and the government this year will provide
around $2 million in subsidies and commercial sponsors give another
$800,000. The rest comes from the box office, advertising revenue
and sales.
   In the last month, Dunlop was stunned when the festival found
itself $16,000 short of the money needed to set up an exhibition
about tartan history and fashion, sponsored by a U.S. trust fund.
   ``Not a single Scottish sponsor was interested, but we finally
scraped it together,'' he said.
   Still, he said, ``We know that Edinburgh wants the festival
despite the hunger of Glasgow and London to kidnap it and the
sniping from down south that Edinburgh doesn't deserve it.''
   Dunlop said in the past five years the festival has become more
international, with companies from Eastern Europe, Japan and South
Korea participating. This year the festival also includes the
Houston Ballet and Martha Clarke dance company from the United
States.
   ``We now must try to get the South and Central Americans here.
It must become a festival of innovation if it is to make
progress,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shiite Cleric Says Hostage Issue Will Meet `Rational Solution'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's most influential Shiite
Moslem cleric said Saturday the hostage issue will ``move in the
direction of a rational solution.'' But he warned it could take a
long time, and any U.S. military move would backfire.
   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah made his comments in an
interview with the Moslem-run radio Voice of the Nation a day after
he offered to help free Western hostages if Western countries
helped release Arab prisoners in Israel.
   Fadlallah is spiritual guide to the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God. The group is believed to be the umbrella organization
for underground factions holding most of the Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   Asked to comment on reports of a planned U.S. military action if
another American hostage is killed, Fadlallah said:
   ``This will not achieve anything but will endanger the hostages
for whom the war is waged and will increase the possibilities of
what America calls terrorism.
   ``We believe that any American military action will backfire and
may provoke revolutionary elements opposed to the American policy
in the region,'' he said.
   ``Therefore, the issue will move in the direction of a rational
solution that may take a long time, but it will not move at all in
a military atmosphere, at least in America's interests,'' he added.
   The United States sent warships to the eastern Mediterranean and
to waters near Iran during the height of the latest hostage crisis.
   The crisis developed after Israel abducted a
Hezbollah-affiliated cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, from south
Lebanon on July 28. Israeli officials say Obeid has since confessed
to helping plan attacks on Israel and to the 1988 abduction of U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, a U.N. peacekeeper in south
Lebanon.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed it hanged
Higgins on July 31 because Israel refused to free Obeid. However,
some reports say he was killed months earlier.
   Another group, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, said it
would kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio if Obeid was not
released. However, it later said it had granted Cicippio a
reprieve, and offered to free him if Israel released Obeid and 450
Arab prisoners and also let 55 Palestinian deportees return to the
occupied lands.
   Israel has said any swap must include three Israeli soldiers
held in Lebanon.
   In his remarks Saturday, Fadlallah also accused the United
States of ``prolonging the detention'' of the hostages.
   ``America could have resolved this problem realistically through
deep, quiet diplomacy .... But instead it has worked on prolonging
the period of their detention because it found out it could use the
hostage issue in its ... war against terrorism,'' Fadlallah said.
   On Friday, Fadlallah said, ``Let us get to an agreement together
so that each side would use his own means and influence to end the
crisis of the hostages _ all hostages _ and resolve the problem of
Arab prisoners,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Fadlallah's statement was worth
noting.
   Among the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon are eight Americans,
four Britons, two West Germans, one Irishman and one Italian.
Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of
The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.

   An American priest whose writings and
broadcasts outraged former President Ferdinand Marcos has won the
1989 Ramon Magsaysay award for Journalism, Literature and Creative
Arts, it was announced Saturday.
   The Rev. James Bertram Reuter Jr. was praised for ``employing
his gifts as writer, theatrical director and broadcaster, but most
of all as teacher to make the performing arts and media a vital
force for the good of the Philippines.''
   Reuter, 73, of New Jersey, began directing plays in 1941 and
wrote scripts for a Catholic radio program. During World War II, he
wrote songs and skits to rally fellow inmates at Japanese prison
camps in the country.
   He was ordained in the United States in 1946 and returned to the
Philippines to teach journalism, write and direct art productions.
   He introduced Catholic programming on television and helped set
up the church's radio station, Veritas. When Marcos declared
martial law in 1972, Reuter was arrested for criticizing the
government.
   In the 1986 presidential elections, Reuter and several other
Catholic broadcasters counted ballots on their own to guard against
fraud.
   Weeks later, in the ensuing military revolt that toppled Marcos'
20-year government and catapulted Corazon Aquino to the presidency,
Reuter helped keep Veritas on the air so Filipinos could be
informed about what was happening.
   The award, bestowed by the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation,
will be presented on Aug. 31, the 82nd birthday of the popular
Philippine president who died in a plane crash in 1957 and whose
name the foundation bears.

<HEAD>Scholars: Light and Dark Sides Are Secrets of Twain's Staying Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL STASHENKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although Mark Twain's humor is a chief
reason for his enduring popularity, several scholars meeting to
commemorate one of the author's least humorous novels said Twain's
brooding side will also help keep him relevant to future
generations.
   ``I think people are figuring out that they can't some day say,
`Well, Mark Twain, he's out of it. He was just a mindless
optimist,''' said Louis Budd, a Duke University professor and
editor of the ``Journal of American Literature.''
   ``People do know there was a darker and more irreverent side to
Mark Twain,'' Budd said.
   Budd was among about 150 literary scholars and Twain fans
attending a three-day conference sponsored by Elmira College's
Center for Mark Twain Studies at Quarry Farm to mark the 100th
anniversary of the publication of ``A Connecticut Yankee in King
Arthur's Court.''
   The conference, held Thursday, Friday and Saturday in the city
where Twain is buried, showed how popular the author remains 79
years after his death.
   ``Only a few years ago, academic types like myself were polled
on who was the greatest American writer and Mark Twain and Walt
Whitman came out No. 1,'' said Everett Emerson, a University of
North Carolina professor and Twain biographer.
   ``Now, in fact, I've almost never known an ordinary person who's
read a whole lot of Walt Whitman,'' he said. ``But Twain is
recognized by professors as a very great writer at the same time
ordinary people do, too. Twain's different from any other American
writer because he's liked by ordinary people.''
   Indeed, debates continued throughout the conference about the
meaning and significance of ``A Connecticut Yankee'' as if the
novel had appeared in 1989 instead of 1889.
   The novel concerns an imaginary trip to 6th-century England by
Hank Morgan, a Connecticut factory mechanic who uses his knowledge
of electricity and other ``modern'' technology to seize control of
the court.
   While the first third of the book is mostly a farce about the
customs of medieval England and the inconveniences of living in
that age, the novel takes on a more ominous tone in its final
two-thirds. It ends with a bloody battle in which thousands of
knights are slaughtered with the help of such 19th century
refinements as electricity and Gatling guns.
   Frederick Crews, a University of California at Berkeley
professor, said the ending of the book ``stuns and chills us.''
   ``Only a few critics have been able to talk themselves out of
the sense that something has gone terribly wrong, not only with the
book but also with Twain,'' he told conference participants.
   Many critics have seen the darkness of the latter part of ``A
Connecticut Yankee'' as presaging the final two troubled decades of
Twain's own life, when a series of financial and personal setbacks
prompted a string of bitter, misanthropic writings. Budd referred
to this stage of the author's life as the ``late, atheistic,
outrageous Twain.''
   Still, Crews and most other experts at the conference agreed
that many passages in ``A Connecticut Yankee'' exhibit the kind of
homespun wit and humor Twain became famous for in ``The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn'' and other books.
   ``It has the makings of a classic,'' he said of ``A Connecticut
Yankee.''
   According to Emerson, Twain's reputation has profited from the
added attention the author has received from centennial
celebrations of ``Huckleberry Finn'' in 1985 and ``A Connecticut
Yankee'' this year.
   ``You must know the worst thing that could happen to a writer is

   Soviet fans jumped, danced and wrapped themselves
in giant American flags Saturday as some of heavy metal's biggest
stars made their Soviet debut in Moscow's biggest-ever hard rock
concert.
   The benefit concert, a two-day extravaganza billed as the
``Moscow Music Peace Festival'' and likened to the Woodstock
festival of 20 years ago, features Western musicians Motley Crue,
Bon Jovi, Scorpions, Cinderella, Ozzy Osbourne, and Skid Row as
well as the Soviet groups Nuance, Gorky Park and Brigada S.
   Proceeds will go to programs that fight drug and alcohol abuse
in the United States and the Soviet Union.
   About 100,000 fans filled the Lenin Stadium in central Moscow
Saturday, many of them reclining on mats or jumping and screaming
near the stage, painted in the psychedelic style of the 1960s.
   Some fans wrapped themselves in giant American flags and formed
human pyramids.
   ``We're athletes, we need some psychological relaxation!'' a
member of the Soviet junior fencing team shouted after the pyramid
he was forming with teammates toppled.
   The concert's Soviet organizer, impressario Stas Namin, told a
news conference Friday the concert would be as important to his
generation as Woodstock was to American youth in 1969.
   ``We will show that rock is not just negative,'' he said.
``After so many years of stigmatization, this is something
positive,''
   At $16 a ticket, the concert was exorbitantly priced by Soviet
standards. However, organizers said it quickly sold out.
   ``This is the first time we've ever had such a concert,'' said
23-year-old Yelena Viklova, who came with her husband. ``There was
no way we could pass up the chance. We came to see the foreign
groups.''
   Rock promoter Alexei Kisilev said the concert represented a
major step forward from two years ago, when Soviet authorities
banned a proposed anti-drug concert because ``they said we didn't
have a drug problem, and our rock was not developed enough.''
   Soviet authorities no longer emphatically condemn rock music as
a decadent Western force, but officials still occasionally express
disapproval of rock culture.
   Few hard rock albums are put out in the Soviet Union, and groups
have generally had a hard time making arrangements for concert
halls and tours. They have, however, gained ground under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's cultural thaw.
   Any parallel with Woodstock, the outdoor festival at a farm in
New York state that became a symbol of the 1960's, escaped many of
Saturday's fans. One 18-year-old Muscovite asked whether Woodstock
had been held in Moscow.
   Kisilev said the weekend's concert could change the Soviet rock
scene and serve as a precedent for more such events.
   One fan at the concert was U.S. ambassador Jack Matlock, who
gave an impromptu press conference wearing one of the ``Just Say
Nyet'' buttons promoters had distributed. The buttons mirrored the
U.S. anti-drug slogan ``Just Say `No.'''
   ``These contacts show we have common goals and common
problems,'' Matlock said as he posed for photos with long-haired
rockers Eric Brittingham and Fred Courey of Cinderella.
   The concert will spawn an album dedicated to rock stars who died
of overdoses. American viewers will be able to see four hours of
performances on cable television Sunday, organizers said.

<HEAD>Film Pioneer, Head of Republic Pictures, Dead At 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nathan ``Nat'' Levine, who worked with Gene
Autry and John Wayne and headed Republic Pictures in a career
spanning the silent and sound eras of movies, has died at age 89.
   Levine died Aug. 6 at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital
in the Woodland Hills area, the hospital reported Friday.
   He entered the film business at age 20 as an independent
distributor who specialized in films rejected by the major studios.
Seven years later he opened his own production company, Mascot
Pictures, working out of an old North Hollywood studio once owned
by Mack Sennett.
   At Mascot he churned out 500 reels of serials, including three
starring Wayne. Under contract to the studio were Autry and fellow
cowboy star Smiley Burnette.
   It was there that he also came to the attention of Republic Film
Laboratories owner Herbert J. Yates, who processed film for Mascot
and noticed it was one of the few small film companies turning a
profit.
   Yates formed Republic Pictures in 1935 and Levine melded Mascot
Pictures into the organization.
   Levine eventually became head of the company, bringing to it his
expertise in low-budget, commercially successful ``B'' features and
long-running adventure serials.
   Such films were Republic's mainstay until it gradually quit
production after the advent of television.
   CBS purchased the studio's old North Hollywood headquarters in
1952 and renamed it Television City.

<HEAD>Indian Peacekeepers Kill 51 Civilians After Attack, Tamils Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian peacekeeping troops killed at
least 51 civilians and set homes and shops on fire after being
attacked by ethnic Tamil rebels in a northern town, Tamil sources
said Saturday.
   The Sri Lankan government, which has been trying to persuade
India to pull out its soldiers, said it has begun an investigation
into the killings.
   The Tamil sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that in addition to killing the civilians, the Indians set fire to
40 homes and 23 shops. A rebel group claimed at least 70 civilians
were killed, but India reported 18 civilians dead.
   The Indian patrol was ambushed Aug. 2 in the town of
Velvettiturai, about 200 miles north of Colombo. At least six
soldiers were killed in the attack, Indian military officials said
at the time.
   A Sri Lankan Defense Ministry official said the investigation
was ordered after Tamil lawmakers in Parliament raised the issue.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government was considering a request that a parliamentary group be
sent to the area to investigate.
   The Tamil sources quoted residents as saying the Indian troops
imposed a 48-hour curfew on Velvettiturai after the ambush and
carried out search operations. Many houses were shelled, and
several of the civilian casualties were burned to death, they said.
   They said 51 victims were identified by relatives after the
curfew was lifted. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the rebel
group fighting the Indians, said in a statement telexed to
newspaper offices from London that at least 70 civilians had been
killed in the offensive.
   However, the Tigers' accounts of casualties have proved to be
exaggerated in the past.
   In New Delhi, a government spokesman said there were 18
civilians killed in an exchange of gunfire between soldiers and
rebels after the ambush. He said 12 rebels and rebel supporters
were killed.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
rebels used civilians as a cover while firing rocket-propelled
grenades and automatic rifles at the Indian army patrol.
   Indian soldiers were sent to Sri Lanka's Tamil-dominated north
and east two years ago to put down a Tamil war for an independent
homeland.
   They were deployed initially to supervise an Indian-sponsored
peace plan that called for the government to give Tamils limited
autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender. However, the Tigers
rejected the agreement and turned their guns on the Indians.
   India got involved in the ethnic problems of this nation off its
southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million
Tamils for the rebel cause.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa had asked India to withdraw its
soldiers by July 29 to appease Sinhalese militants who object to
the Indian presence as well as the Tamil rebels. India, however,
said a quick withdrawal could lead to more violence.
   India has instead said it will withdraw its more than 40,000
soldiers in phases. It says they will all be out by February.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They
say they suffer discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population and control the government.
   Militant Tamils launched their separatist war in 1983. At least
11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have been killed
since then.

   An old dinner theater that now houses
country music singer Johnny Cash's museum is for sale for $795,000.
   Reba Hancock, Cash's sister and general manager of the House of
Cash museum, said Friday that Cash will move the museum to some
other spot in suburban Hendersonville.
   ``We just decided that this place was too big for our needs, so
we've decided to sell it and relocate elsewhere in
Hendersonville,'' she said. ``We don't have any idea where at this
point.''
   The building is 14,000-square feet on a one-acre tract. Cash
bought the property in 1970.
   The museum also is the corporate office for the business
interests of Cash and his wife, June Carter Cash.

   Larry Gatlin says he and his
country-music-singing brothers have erased a $1.6 million debt
caused by cocaine and bad investments.
   ``Zero's a beautiful number, you know, when you were a minus
$1.6 million,'' he said Saturday.
   Gatlin said he and brothers Steve and Rudy wiped out the debt
during the past five years.
   Contributing to his trouble was the oil crisis and his own drug
problems, he said.
   ``When oil went down to $12.80 a barrel, it ripped some
knickers, including ours. I spent money on cocaine. I spent money
on gambling. I spent money on bad investments.''
   Since seeking professional help in 1985 for his cocaine use,
Gatlin has worked for anti-drug causes.
   The trio is known for such hit records as ``All the Gold in
California,'' ``Broken Lady'' and ``Houston.''

   An unemployed construction worker was
sentenced to 16 months in jail for stealing singer Barbra
Streisand's 1976 Mercedes-Benz.
   Olin Lipscomb Jr., 35, pleaded guilty last month to one count of
theft and unlawful driving of a vehicle.
   Superior Court Commissioner Florence Cooper dismissed two other
charges of grand theft auto and evading arrest in sentencing
Lipscomb on Friday.
   Lipscomb took the car July 5 after Streisand's secretary parked
it on a street, police said.
   Officers spotted the car about four hours later and gave chase.
Lipscomb lost control of the vehicle and struck the patrol car. The
Mercedes suffered moderate damage and Lipscomb cut his finger. The
officers were unhurt.

   Multimillionaire publisher Malcolm
Forbes rode his green and gold motorcycle through a dealership and
hobnobbed with bikers en route to the Black Hills Motorcycle
Classic in Sturgis.
   Forbes, 69, riding a Harley-Davidson, said Friday he was making
a return visit to the motorcycle rally, which attracts thousands of
bikers every year.
   ``I guess it's the same thing that makes everyone keep coming
back _ it's a mecca for anyone who loves Harleys. I'm one of the
many with the good sense to enjoy it,'' Forbes said.
   ``He's a symbol that you're never too old to ride,'' Paul
Sjoquist, a 56-year-old Minneapolis lawyer, said. ``I'm a
professional person myself and I enjoy seeing someone like that
ride. The sport of riding needs respectability and he has given it
that.
   ``He's just a regular sort of guy. A very nice man.''
   Forbes, whose wealth has been estimated as high as $1 billion,
took over the Forbes magazine company in 1964.
   He says he didn't ride a motorcycle until he was 48 and now has
70 of the machines.
   ``I was afraid to try,'' he said. ``For the last 21 years I've
been making up for lost time.''
   Forbes also brought with him a purple Harley-Davidson 883 _ the
bike he gave to his friend, actress Elizabeth Taylor.
   ``It's purple passion. Just like her perfume,'' Forbes said,
adding that Taylor would not attend the rally in Sturgis.
   He said his relationship with Taylor was friendly. ``A very
happy and enjoyable friendship continues. She's going with me to
Morocco next Tuesday.''
   Forbes plans to celebrate his 70th birthday next Saturday at a
$2 million party for 600 at his Palais Mendoub in Tangier, Morocco.

   A classified section of the soon-to-be
released national drug strategy calls for an expansion of U.S.
military training for local forces in three South American
countries and allocates $300 million for anti-drug efforts, an
administration source says.
   ``Given that they now receive pocket change, it could be a
tripling'' of U.S. expenditures for the world's largest
cocaine-producing countries: Peru, Bolivia and Colombia, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States already provides some military training of
local forces in Bolivia, but not to Peru or Colombia.
   President Bush, in campaign speeches, called for stepped up
actions against drugs at their South American origins. But such
attempts have been largely unsuccessful because of guerrilla wars,
economic problems and a lack of resources.
   The administration official stressed that the proposal calls for
more training of troops, not for actual military operations by
American forces. Also, the local governments would have to request
the presence of U.S. armed forces overseas.
   ``There's nothing unilateral contemplated,'' the source said.
   The proposal is in a classified section of the drug strategy
drafted by national drug policy director William J. Bennett. The
National Security Council is reviewing all international and
interdiction proposals. President Bush is scheduled to present the
final package to Congress on Sept. 5.
   Although some aspects of Bennett's proposed strategy have
triggered some bickering between agencies, a source said there has
been ``no opposition to expanding training'' by the military.
   Special Forces troops currently train forces in Bolivia, and a
source said the expansion contemplated would be ``building on the
number of people we have down there.''
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, cautioned that
``increased military involvement in Latin American anti-drug
efforts must be treated extremely carefully. Any U.S. military
involvement must be through multilateral efforts such as the
Organization of American States or the United Nations, and must be
welcomed by the country involved.''
   The proposal was derided by Lawrence J. Smith, D-Fla., chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Task Force on
International Narcotics, who said ``$300 million for countries that
are very beleaguered, whose economies are in a shambles, that's a
spit in the ocean. That's tokenism, that's what it is.''
   Giving those countries more aid would work ``only if they are
capable of utilizing it,'' Smith said in an interview Friday from
his Florida office. ``... Most of these countries have not had the
ability to digest more aid. They don't have the troops. They don't
have the expertise.''
   The commitment of U.S. military advisers, equipment and economic
aid should be dependent on the recipient countries committing their
own military forces to the anti-drug effort, something they have
done only on rare occasions, he said.
   ``I'll be happy to give all that to them if they'll tell me
they'll let the military loose to get involved in eradication,''
Smith said.
   Rangel took a somewhat different position, saying, ``Merely
increasing anti-narcotics assistance without development of a
comprehensive plan that addresses the economic and social needs of
drug-producing countries will not succeed.
   ``In addition to crop eradication, we must improve assistance
for law enforcement, make provisions for income alternatives for
illicit narcotics crop cultivation, and consider whether debt and
trade incentives are needed as part of an effective anti-narcotics
strategy,'' Rangel said.
   Capitol Hill's lack of access to copies of Bennett's proposed
strategy has prompted some displeasure among members of Congress,
particularly those who are actively involved in drug issues. Both
Rangel and Smith said they based their comments on news reports of
what the strategy proposes.
   The draft strategy was distributed to a select few officials in
each of the federal agencies involved in anti-drug efforts, and
they were directed to keep it confidential.
   Rangel and Smith said they and other chairmen of congressional
committees concerned with drug matters met with Bennett last week.
   ``He asked Congress not to take seriously all the stories
appearing in the press about the contents of the proposed
strategy,'' Rangel said in a statement. ``He told us he is
presently `bouncing ideas' off the American people. He asked us to
reserve comment until the report is approved by the president and
released.''
   Among other things, Rangel said the strategy will be meaningful
only if the president calls for full funding of its proposals.
   ``The strategy will be pure rhetoric and will become a broken
administration promise if real dollars, not just the words in this
plan, are not provided,'' he said. ``You can't say you're going to
declare war and provide no money for the bullets.''

   Rob Russell eased into the gun turret,
adjusting his helmet and closing the hatch over his head. As his
buddy, Nels Anderson, positioned their tank, Russell reached for
his ammunition _ a bucket of racquetballs.
   As he took aim at another tank, the high school freshman joined
hundreds of others in what has become this summer's hottest
amusement park attraction _ Tank Tag.
   ``It's addictive,'' said Russell, 14, of Sudbury, as he and
Anderson prepared for their sixth ride in the tanks at the Millbury
Amusement Center, about 35 miles west of Boston.
   ``It's a lot more realistic than a computer game,'' said
Anderson, 33, a computer programmer from Framingham, ``and you
can't get hurt.''
   The country's newest war game has sprung up at about 20
amusement parks, including ones in Orlando, Fla., Myrtle Beach,
S.C., Wildwood, N.J., and San Diego, and dozens of others are
expected to follow suit.
   Tank Tag's popularity has soared since it surfaced in Allentown,
Pa., last summer. It was invented by Robert Plarr, president of
Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown.
   ``It's like being in World War II without getting hurt,'' said
Plarr. ``It's just like the gladiators in Roman times. This is the
first time in history you're part of a shooting gallery.''
   More than 150 amusement park owners from around the world have
scheduled visits to the Allentown facility this month to inspect
Tank Tag as a potential attraction for their own parks, according
to Plarr. He said a group of South Koreans visited last week to see
if they could install Tank Tag and a water war game at some of the
former Olympic Games sites in Seoul.
   Plarr, a former Marine who addresses everyone as ``sir'' or
``ma'am,'' expanded his basic tank game idea to the water games.
   The tag game uses two to four small-scale, computerized,
made-to-order tanks that are mounted on tires instead of treads and
powered by hydraulic Honda engines.
   The tanks, which Plarr says cost from $20,000 to $40,000 each,
are designed for two people _ one who ``drives'' the tank by
pressing a gas-powered pedal on the floor and the other seated in
the turret. Each pays $4.50 a ride.
   The game includes 10 simulated guns placed along the perimeter
of the Tank Tag area. Participants who choose not to ride on the
tanks can stay behind the protective netting and fire balls, paid
for by the bucket, at the tanks.
   The balls shot from a tank turret or from one of the outside
guns can go at 60 mph.
   ``I think it's kind of cute,'' said Vicki Suhl, 38, who watched
her son, Josh, 9, fire at the tanks from the perimeter. ``It's a
bigger version of Nintendo.''
   The only restriction on participants is height _ you must be at
least 4{ feet tall to crawl inside a tank.
   In Allentown, more than 50 percent of the participants are women
and children, said Plarr.
   Plarr avoids comment on the paramilitary aspects of Tank Tag. He
prefers to view the game as the heir to the carnival shooting
gallery of the past and as testament to a new demand for
participatory games.
   ``People want to touch, feel, taste. They don't want to be put
in a car. They want to drive themselves,'' said Plarr. ``This is a
do-it-yourself ride.''

<HEAD>Bomb Doesn't Dampen Protestant Parade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Irish Republican Army
bomb was barely noticed Saturday as thousands of drum-banging
Protestants celebrated a victory over a Catholic king three
centuries ago.
   But the explosion that wrecked a bar four hours before the
Apprentice Boys' Parade, causing no injuries, underlined tensions
as Northern Ireland approaches the 20th anniversary of the British
government's decision to send in troops.
   It was the Apprentice Boys' Parade in 1969 that touched off
rioting in Roman Catholic areas and led to troops arriving in the
province on Aug. 14, 1969.
   Saturday's bomb, said marcher Robert Kerr, ``means we have no
security.''
   ``For the amount of money they're spending, we should get better
security,'' said Kerr, who drove 60 miles from his farm near
Dungannon to join the parade.
   ``(The bomb) was only a small sample of what we've had,'' added
William Coulter of Londonderry.
   Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a Butcher
Street bar. It had been discovered by security forces who evacuated
the area, but it exploded before army experts could defuse it, said
a spokesman who refused to be named.
   The explosion shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial
Hall, but no one was hurt.
   ``It will not stop us. It will not dampen our spirits in any
way,'' said Derek Miller, general secretary of the Apprentice Boys
organization.
   A statement released by the IRA said the bomb was timed to go
off when security forces were in the area. By planting the device,
the statement said, the IRA proved it could strike despite heavy
security.
   The mainly Catholic IRA seeks to drive the British out of the
province.
   On Friday night, police said they seized a bomb packed with 10
pounds of Semtex plastic explosives and arrested two men in the
Catholic Creggan neighborhood of Londonderry.
   There was heavy security along the parade route across the broad
River Foyle and through the picturesque walled city, with dozens of
gray armored police vehicles in the streets and soldiers patrolling
in full combat gear.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, a British police force, however,
reported that the parade pased without incident.
   Before the parade, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. James Kane,
told worshipers at St. Columb's Anglican Cathedral it would be
wrong to provoke sectarian passions.
   ``Rather we should endeavour to teach our fellow countrymen to
look at the past in a calm and kindly spirit, to rise superior to
the passions of the ages ...'' Kane said.
   The parade was a rich mixture of politics and religion, with
bands marching to such tunes as ``Abide with Me'' and ``Stand Up,
Stand Up for Jesus'' to a martial beat.
   Londonderry has long been a place of mythic significance to
Protestants as the scene of a 15-week siege in 1689 by the forces
of the exiled Catholic King James II, who had been ousted in favor
of the Protestant William of Orange, the Dutch-born prince who
ruled Britain jointly with his English wife and cousin, Mary.
   The ``no surrender'' spirit of the apprentice boys who slammed
the city gates to prevent their leader from capitulating lives on
as a political slogan for the so-called Loyalist side _ the large
segment of the Protestant community that supports British rule.
   Aug. 12 is the day the siege was lifted.
   Londonderry was a focus of the Catholic civil rights marches of
the 1960s because of the blatant gerrymandering that perpetuated
the Protestant minority's control of local government.
   Even the name is contentious: to loyalists it is Londonderry, to
nationalists it is Derry. Once Catholics gained control of the
local council, it became the Derry District Council.
   The Catholic community plans its own march Monday evening,
followed by a speech by Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, a prominent
firebrand of the republican movement in the 1960s.
   The current IRA campaign dates from the turbulent days after
British troops arrived. The Provisional Irish Republican Army broke
away from the old IRA organization to wage guerrilla war on the
British Army and other targets.
   British troops in the province currently number more than
10,000, compared a peak of 22,000 at the height of the violence in
1972.
   They are backed by 6,500 members of the Ulster Defense Regiment,
a locally recruited unit of the British Army.
   Since the troops arrived, more than 2,700 people have been slain.

   A singer and two crew members with LL Cool
J's rap band were charged with raping a 15-year-old girl who
attended an after-concert party after going backstage on a pass won
in a radio contest.
   The girl told authorities that six to eight men taunted her
during the assault and made comments such as, ``When's it going to
be our turn?''
   Singer David James Parker, 26, and band technician Gary Chris
Saunders, 22, both of New York City, and bodyguard Christopher
Elias Tsipouras, 26, of Union, N.J., were charged Friday with
first-degree criminal sexual conduct, said Kevin Johnson, assistant
Hennepin County attorney.
   LL Cool J, whose real name is James Todd Smith, was not involved
in the incident after Wednesday night's concert and did not meet
the 15-year-old, police said. He and the rest of his group were
continuing their three-month national tour.
   They three who were charged were being held Saturday at the
Hennepin County jail under $100,000 bail each. They were scheduled
for court appearances Monday, Johnson said. The felony is
punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $35,000 fine.
   ``We're going to try to find out who else was in the room,''
Johnson said. ``If we can learn who they are, they could be
charged, too,'' as accomplices.
   The girl and a 16-year-old female friend received backstage
passes along with tickets to Wednesday's concert when one of them
won a radio station's contest. They accompanied group members in a
limousine to L'Hotel Sofitel in Bloomington for the party on
Tsipouras' promise he would introduce them to LL Cool J,
authorities said.
   Sexual advances were made to the girls, and the 16-year-old
left, Bloomington police Sgt. Michael Jennings said. The younger
girl could not escape and eventually was sexually assaulted by
three men, the sergeant said.
   ``They were overwhelmed by the celebrity status and all the
flash,'' said Johnson. ``I think they were naive enough to go into
the hotel thinking they would meet LL Cool J.''
   The girl was crying and screaming during the incident, and other
people were coming and going from the hotel room, Detective Dan
Laurila said.
   The three men were arrested early Thursday morning.
   The radio station, KDWB, is reviewing its practice of awarding
backstage passes, said general manager Gary Swartz, who said he was
outraged by the incident.
   LL Cool J, short for Ladies Love Cool James, is among the best
known rappers, and has a current hit, ``Walking With a Panther.''
His songs are known for explicit lyrics involving sexual conquests
and macho stereotypes.

   Battles between tribesmen and native
Assamese in northeastern India have left at least 95 people dead,
witnesses and news reports said Saturday. One official said 60,000
residents had fled.
   The warring sides fought with spears, bows and arrows, and
homemade guns, said a witness to the clashes at Gohpur.
   ``It was like an ancient war,'' said Dibya Kalita, who fled to
Guwahati to escape the violence. Gohpur is 112 miles northeast of
this capital city of Assam state.
   The Bodo tribesmen, who are of Mongol origin, are campaigning
for a separate homeland in Assam, a remote state bordering
Bangladesh.
   The Press Trust of India news agency said Saturday that 95
bodies have been found in the area. It said the clashes had raged
over the past four days.
   Officials reported five deaths, but their count was believed to
be much too low.
   The Assam director-general of police, S.V. Subramanium,
confirmed reports of the battles but said he was awaiting details.
   The Assamese backlash at Gohpur started after 10 Assamese were
burnt to death in a neighboring area. Bodo militants were blamed
for the deaths.
   Hundreds of Bodo homes in 20 villages were set on fire, forcing
residents to flee to neighboring Arunachal Pradesh state.
   A state government spokesman in the state capital, Itanagar,
said 60,000 Bodos had crossed the state border since Wednesday.
   ``We are trying to provide them with shelter, but we fear more
will come over,'' one official said by telephone from Guwahati. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Bodos, mostly farmers, were animists before they converted
earlier this century to Christianity and Hinduism, India's dominant
religion. The Bodos make up about 30 percent of Assam's 20 million
people.
   The proposed Bodoland would cover about one-third of Assam's
territory.
   The government has refused to consider the Bodo demand for a
separate homeland but says it is willing to talk to militants about
ending the violence.
   Some Bodos began demanding a homeland more than two decades ago,
but there were very few reports of violence until recent years.
   In a related development, Bodo militants killed eight Assamese
policemen and wounded six in Nalbari district about 40 miles from
Guwahati, police said Saturday.
   The policemen were killed when the militants used a
remote-control bomb to blow up their jeep.
   No arrests were reported.

   A suspect has taken a polygraph test in
the case of the possible politically motivated abduction of a
councilwoman's dog, authorities said.
   Authorities would not release results of the test or the
suspect's name on Saturday. Police Chief George Weeden said Friday
the use of the polygraph did not signal a pending arrest.
   Town Council President Sandra Johanson's golden retriever Kelly,
a 7-year-old female, failed to come home after a romp on July 31.
Johanson said a man phoned her about 12 hours later and said, ``Get
off the council and you'll get your dog.''
   Johanson, a three-term Republican council member, has kept her
position.
   Police have said that stealing a dog is punishable by up to a
year in jail, and extortion by a maximum of 15 years in jail.
Investigators said they think the call may be genuine because
relatively few people knew of the dog's disappearance at the time
the call was made.

   A jury found the city was not negligent in the
death of a 20-month-old boy who was one of 12 people who died in a
1987 house fire.
   A Milwaukee County Circuit Court jury deliberated for five hours
Friday night before ruling against Jill Schreck, who sued the city
in connection with the death of her toddler son, Anthony.
   Ms. Schreck claimed the city was negligent because a building
inspector, who was at the one-family house three weeks before the
fire, did not tell another resident, Annie Phillips, that smoke
detectors were the responsibility of the tenants.
   The jury ruled Ms. Schreck and Ms. Phillips, both survivors of
the blaze, each was 50 percent negligent.
   ``It's over with,'' Ms. Schreck cried when approached by
reporters after the verdict was announced. ``My son's gone and I'm
the one that _ just leave me alone.''
   Testimony at the trial conflicted on whether there were working
smoke alarms at the time of the fire.

   Hundreds of friends and relatives attended
a memorial service Saturday for four children who drowned when the
family station wagon plunged into a river, but the youngsters'
mother was in seclusion and their father in jail charged with their
murders.
   About 500 people crowded into a suburban Detroit church to say
farewell to Brian DeLisle, 8, and his sisters: Melissa, 4; Kadie,
2; and Emily, 10 months.
   ``Brian was probably my best friend on the team. He used to tell
a lot of jokes,'' 10-year-old Clinton Runyon, who played on a
baseball team with Brian this summer, said after the service.
   The skinny, short-haired youth said he nearly broke down during
the one-hour memorial Mass at St. Alfred Roman Catholic Church.
   ``My mom started crying and I was afraid I would start bawling,
but I held it in,'' he said.
   Wyandotte police say Lawrence DeLisle, 28, of Lincoln Park,
confessed to pressing down the car's accelerator and driving into
the Detroit River on Aug. 3 ``to be rid of his present burdens.''
He was described as pressed by money problems.
   Police say he intended to kill his children and wife, Suzanne,
32, by driving the car through a barrier on a road that ended at
the river in the suburb south of Detroit.
   Both parents escaped from the sinking station wagon in which
DeLisle's father committed suicide 18 months earlier. Passing
boaters tossed them life preservers; divers pulled the children
from the submerged car about an hour later.
   The Rev. Walter Ptak asked mourners not to prejudge the tragedy.
   ``We gather here this morning in such large numbers in an act of
faith in our God, not to point fingers of blame or to prejudge what
has happened, but to give thanks to God for the gift of the
children's lives,'' said Ptak, assistant pastor at St. Alfred's.
   Mrs. DeLisle wasn't up to attending the memorial service for her
children, Ptak said. ``It was a family decision that it was better
if she didn't attend.'' The remains of the four children were
cremated Monday.
   Eleanor Klauza of Allen Park said after the service that she
doesn't know the DeLisles, but attended the service to show the
family she cared.
   ``If he didn't want the children, he should have given them
away,'' she said.
   But Dorothy Weatherly, 38, Clinton Runyon's mother, said, ``I
don't believe he could have done it because of the way he was
around those children.''
   DeLisle, a sales manager at a Lincoln Park tire store, was
ordered held without bond Friday on four counts of first-degree
murder and one of attempted murder.
   The suspect first said a leg cramp caused him to jam the
accelerator pedal, powering the car through a barricade and into
the river. But Thursday, he admitted the crash was deliberate, said
Wyandotte Detective Sgt. Daniel Galeski.
   Mrs. DeLisle said she tried to stop the car by turning off the
ignition and shifting gears before the car struck the barrier.
   Relatives and acquaintances said DeLisle had trouble saving
money and had amassed $13,000 in debts during the last 10 years.
They said he worried about how he would provide for his family on
his $33,000-a-year salary.
   DeLisle remained silent during the 10-minute hearing and a plea
of innocent was entered on his behalf. Twenty-seventh District
Judge Lawrence Emmert ordered him held without bond until another
court appearance Thursday.
   First-degree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in
prison without possibility of parole. Attempted murder has a
maximum sentence of life in prison.

<HEAD>Botha Appears Isolated in Power Struggle With Heir Apparent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governing party leader F.W. de
Klerk indicated Saturday his Cabinet colleagues supported him as a
showdown approached in a leadership struggle with outgoing
President P.W. Botha.
   Political commentators said the seemingly isolated Botha might
quit under pressure or try to assert himself at a Cabinet meeting
Monday by firing de Klerk, who replaced the president in February
as head of the National Party.
   De Klerk is expected to succeed Botha as president after
parliamentary elections on Sept. 6.
   One opposition leader, Andries Treurnicht of the far-right
Conservative Party, said de Klerk was leading a ``palace
revolution'' against Botha and suggested the president could fire
any rebellious ministers.
   Relations between Botha and de Klerk have been strained for
months, but the rift intensified Friday when the president
announced tersely he had not been consulted about de Klerk's
planned diplomatic mission to Zambia on Aug. 28.
   De Klerk met for nearly three hours Saturday with almost the
entire Cabinet at his home in Pretoria, then announced that the
ministers had reached a unanimous decision how to handle the
dispute when Botha convenes a full Cabinet meeting on Monday in
Cape Town.
   De Klerk refused to elaborate on the decision, but said: ``The
National Party does not in the least underestimate the seriousness
of the situation.''
   The dispute has deeply embarrassed the party at a crucial stage
in election campaign and has virtually eliminated any chance for
Botha, 73, to exit gracefully after 11 years in power.
   De Klerk and Foreign Minister Pik Botha have been invited to
meet with Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, a longtime critic of
South Africa's racial segregation policies, The meeting has been
hailed as a potentially historic breakthrough for South Africa, and
Pik Botha announced Saturday that the trip would proceed despite
the leadership dispute.
   The meeting of Cabinet members at de Klerk's home was viewed as
a direct challenge by the education minister against the president.
Under the Constitution, only the president can convene a formal
Cabinet meeting, although the ministers all are National Party
members who owe political loyalty to de Klerk.
   Pierre Claassen, political writer for the independent South
African Press Association, reported that National Party
officeholders were united in ``ill-concealed anger'' at President
Botha.
   Leaders of the liberal and far-right white opposition parties,
hoping for major gains in the elections, said the dispute reflected
chaos atop the National Party, which has held power since 1948.
   Kaunda made the initial announcement of the Aug. 28 meeting. Pik
Botha, the foreign minister, subsequently confirmed the plans and
said the arrangements were made in consultation with President
Botha.
   The president, in a two-sentence statement Friday, in effect
called his foreign minister a liar.
   ``I am not aware, in terms of the rules governing overseas
journeys by (Cabinet) ministers, of the discussions to be held on
28 August as announced by Dr. Kaunda,'' the president said.
   Newspapers reported Saturday that Pik Botha was braced for the
possibility that the president might fire him. The Star of
Johannesburg said the entire Cabinet might resign if any minister,
including de Klerk, were fired. The Citizen, another Johannesburg
daily, said the president could resign ``at any moment.''
   The leadership rift surfaced when Botha resigned as National
Party leader after suffering a stroke in January. Party officials
backed de Klerk in a power struggle focusing on how soon Botha
would retire.
   De Klerk's planned meeting with Kaunda is seen as important
because the Zambian is chairman of the six-nation Frontline States,
established for the purpose of confronting South Africa's white-led
government.
   Kaunda reportedly may offer to arrange a summit of all states in
the region, including South Africa, if de Klerk commits his
government to negotiating with the African National Congres.
   The ANC, headquartered in Zambia, has waged a bombing and
sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white-minority rule in
South Africa and gaining full political rights for the black
majority.

   A pair of earthquakes of moderate intensity
struck the Pacific coastal area Saturday but caused no damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   A quake registering 4.7 on the Richter scale rattled the coast
in the state of Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border, at 7:12 a.m.,
Mexico's seismic center said. A second quake, registering 5.5 on
the Richter scale, hit at 9:31 a.m. about 175 miles southwest of
Mexico City and 100 miles from the resort of Acapulco.
   ``We felt it, but it was very weak,'' said Irene Banos, a
receptionist at the Red Cross in Acapulco. She said the office had
received no calls for help.
   Some residents of Mexico City reported feeling the earthquake
slightly.
   In Golden, Colorado, the U.S. National Earthquake Information
Center also reported the second quake.
   Geophysicist John Minsch said it was about 60 miles deep,
``which might account for it being felt over longer distances.'' He
said the deep quakes ``don't cause as much damage as shallow
earthquakes.''
   Earthquakes are common along Mexico's seismically active west
coast.
   A pair of massive earthquakes struck Mexico City in September
1985, killing an estimated 10,000 people and destroying hundreds of
buildings. The first registered 8.1 on the Richter scale and
another the following day registered 7.5.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 5 on the Richter scale can cause considerable
damage and one of 6 can cause severe damage.

   The Pentagon on Saturday dispatched five more
aircraft and 100 more people to Ethiopia to help search for Rep.
Mickey Leland, and his office chief backed off earlier criticism of
the rescue effort by saying she is now ``tremendously gratified''
by it.
   Navy Capt. Stan Bloyer declared ``we're not anywhere close'' to
scaling down the hunt for Leland, D-Texas, and 15 others, whose
chartered Twin Otter vanished Monday on a flight from Addis Ababa
to a refugee camp near the Sudan border about 270 miles
west-southwest of the capital.
   ``We're going to apply all the resources we can use,'' said
Bloyer, former air operations chief of the Sixth Fleet and now with
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``We're going to continue to operate on
the premise that there are survivors.''
   Bloyer said the U.S. team is again concentrating its search,
including photo-reconnaissance flights by U-2 spy planes, along
Leland's planned flight path, after concluding that two earlier
leads, involving faint signals detected both north and south of
Addis Ababa by weather satellites, were merely false readings.
   As of Saturday, the U.S. military had one C-141 medical
evacuation aircraft, two HC-130 search and rescue aircraft, and
four MH-60 search and rescue helicopters, equipped with special
night-vision gear, stationed in Ethiopia, along with 165 men and
women, Bloyer said. He reported that two more HC-130s, one EC-130
command and control aircraft and two C-141 transports were on the
way, along with 100 more people, and would arrive Sunday.
   The latest contingent includes Maj. Gen. James F. Record,
director of operations of the U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air
Force Base in Florida, who will coordinate the American team.
   Coupled with the efforts of Ethiopia, Bloyer said, ``I'm not
aware of any search and rescue effort in the world that's involved
this many airplanes.''
   But he noted that the effort continues to be dogged by poor
weather, limiting the usefulness of the 6,000 feet of film returned
from each of the U-2 overflights, and hampering the visibility of
the lower-flying rescue fleet.
   Two U-2 flights have yielded no results, and a third U-2 mission
was flown Saturday. Each flight lasts 10 hours, with just two of
those over the search area, and developing and analyzing the huge
amount of film requires many additional hours.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Leland's press secretary and office
chief, Alma Newsom, retreated from her angry criticism Friday of
the rescue effort.
   Following reassurances later Friday from President Bush and
others, she said, the staff is convinced that a ``commitment and
sense of urgency are now operating at all levels. We are
tremendously gratified by that.''
   Ms. Newsom had said Friday that ``we have seen motion, we have
seen some action, but we have also seen a lot of missteps,'' adding
that ``we could have and should have located them by now.''
   Saturday, in voice weakened by laryngitis, she said: ``I was
somewhat astounded and not a little distressed that some had
interpreted my remarks yesterday as being anti-military _ anti-our
men and women in the military. Nothing could be further from the
truth. We all believe that ... when the U.S. armed forces come to
the rescue, they have no peer.''
   Bloyer said that while U.S. authorities have permission to
operate in the skies over Sudan, the main search effort will
continue to be focused inside Ethiopia for the time being.
``Certainly it is possible the airplane proceeded into Sudan, and
we will be exploring that in due course,'' he said.
   Until now, he said, the U.S. planes have used ``techniques that
would give a 50 percent probability of detection,'' in the primary
search area. ``We're changing now to a much slower and deliberate
mode, which should give us n 80-90 percent capability of
detection,'' he explained.
   The four helicopters, flown in from Eglin Air Force Base in
Florida, are equipped with infrared devices and crews trained in
night vision, but regular night flights likely won't begin until
Monday, weather allowing, when relief crews are available, he said.
   As it is, the choppers are flying throughout the daylight hours,
with mid-air refueling from the HC-130s, he said.
   Earlier in the week, hopes were raised that either of the two
signals monitored via satellite had come from the plane's emergency
beacon. But Bloyer explained that the only ground station able to
monitor the satellite data as it passed over Ethiopia is in India,
so far away that ``it's on the very fringes of the ability'' to
decipher the signal correctly.
   Sophisticated electronic gear on lower-flying U.S. planes found
no signals at the two locations, and, moreover, no evidence was
found in either area by thousand of Ethiopian troops which combed
them on oot, he said.
   Bloyer noted, however, that the plane's emergency beacon would
begin to deteriorate after 72 hours, and any ``usable signal''
likely would disappear in a week as the transmitter's batteries
wore down.

   A coal mine explosion killed five Soviet
workers and injured two on Norway's Svalbard Islands, the Norwegian
news agency NTB said Saturday.
   Details of Friday's accident were not known but it was probably
caused when methane gas in the mine ignited, Magnus Storhaug of the
Svalbard governor's office told NTB on Saturday.
   The Soviets reported the accident to the governor of the Arctic
archipelago on Saturday. NTB quoted Storhaug as saying this was the
first time the Soviets informed Norway of an accident on the island.
   The mine is owned by Trust Artikuol, a Soviet company operating
on the Norwegian islands, 400 miles northwest of Norway. The
Soviets and other countries were granted access to the Norwegian
islands under a 1925 treaty.

   Thousands of people rallied in the southern
republic of Azerbaijan Saturday to demand the removal of Soviet
troops from an mainly Armenian area of the republic, activists said.
   Demonstrators in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku called for a
strike and another protest Monday if authorities fail to meet their
demands, said Mamedgassan Gambarov, a member of the Azerbaijani
People's Front.
   Gambarov, speaking by telephone from Baku, said other demands
entailed the recall of unpopular Azerbaijani deputies to the Soviet
parliament and the cancellation of curfews throughout the Caucasus
republic.
   Moslem activist Almaz Yestekov said the front was asking for the
removal of Soviet troops from Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly Christian
Armenian enclave in traditionally Shiite Moslem Azerbaijan.
   Disputes over the area, which neighboring Armenia wants to
annex, have led to violence several times in the last 18 months,
causing authorities to impose curfews and bring in troops to keep
order. Scores of people have been killed and thousands fled their
homes.
   Slogans at Saturday's protest included ``Karabakh and Azerbaijan
are indivisible'' according to Yestekov, who said he heads a
fledgling news agency specializing in Moslem areas of the Soviet
Union.
   Activists said thousands of people attended the rally, but they
gave no specific figure.
   Speakers also called for authorities to give the People's Front
full legal status as an organization, Yestekov said.
   People's Front groups have sprung up in many of the 15 Soviet
republics in an effort to push local demands for autonomy. They
have become especially strong in the Baltic republics.

   Sen. Warren Rudman told Chinese leaders Saturday
that if China maintains its crackdown on dissent the U.S. Congress
might approve even harsher sanctions on the communist nation.
   The New Hampshire Republican said he met with Wan Li, chairman
of the National People's Congress's Standing Committee, and Vice
Foreign Minister Zhu Qizhen to ``make sure Chinese leaders
understood clearly the impact of the events of June ... on the
American people.''
   It was the first meeting by a ranking U.S. lawmaker since
Washington banned diplomatic contacts with the Chinese leadership
in June because of the violent suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   Rudman said, ``The ban applies only to the executive branch, not
to members of Congress. ... My visit doesn't change the status of
our (U.S.-Chinese) relations at all.''
   ``I thought it was extremely important that they understand that
there is a deep feeling in the United States Congress about what
happened here in June,'' Rudman told reporters.
   Washington imposed the ban to protest the killing of hundreds
and perhaps thousands of people when the army crushed the
student-led democracy movement in Beijing June 3-4 and continued
the crackdown in other cities.
   The Chinese ``ought to understand very clearly that if certain
things don't change, or if there were a repeat of some of those
events, we can expect Congress to react very vigorously,'' Rudman
said.
   He came to Beijing at the invitation of the Chinese Institute of
Foreign Affairs.
   Rudman said he briefed Vice Foreign Minister Zhu, who is the
ambassador-designate to the United States, on what to expect in
Washington and told Zhu and Wan Li that many members of Congress
advocate harsher sanctions against Beijing.
   China's official Xinhua news agency said Wan Li told Rudman that
legislative sanctions against China ``constitute gross interference
in China's internal affairs and we cannot but react strongly.''
   In addition to the prohibition of high-level contacts, the
United States, the European Economic Community and some other
Western nations also are maintaining indefinite bans on military
exchanges, arms sales and new soft loans.
   Rudman said ``as much as they (the Chinese) would like to
criticize us for meddling in their internal affairs, it wasn't
meddling at all.''
   Rudman expressed support of President Bush's opposition to
stricter legislative actions and said he told the Chinese officials
``most members of Congress do agree with President Bush that this
relationship is very important.''
   But he added: ``To the extent (China's) internal affairs tend to
offend some basic values Americans hold, that would limit the
freedom of action of the president.
   ``It could result in a response from Congress that would further
injure the relationship.''
   Rudman said he did not come to Beijing to act as a negotiator.
   ``In my view, only the President and his representative the
ambassador can negotiate or offer the assurances of the United
States,'' Rudman said. ``I thought it was important that they
(Chinese leaders) understood that the Congress has a major role to
play in this.''

   British nobility joined American cowboys and
other Northern Plains states descendants Saturday to dedicate Fort
Union, once the frontier's fur trading headquarters, and to mark
two neighboring states' centennials.
   The fort _ which played host to visitors ranging from Prince
Maximilian of Germany to naturalist James J. Audubon in the 1800s _
has been rebuilt to highlight the centennials of North Dakota and
neighboring Montana.
   An estimated 15,000 people were expected to attend the two-day
dedication of the four-year, multimillion-dollar restoration
project by the National Park Service.
   ``The National Park Service and everyone else associated with it
should be proud of their effort,'' said Lord John Jacob Astor VIII,
a direct descendant of John Jacob Astor, the founder of the
powerful American Fur Trading Co. that built Fort Union in 1829.
   Located near the North Dakota-Montana border at the confluence
of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers, Fort Union was a
headquarters for fur traders and Indians of the mid-1800s.
   The area now is dominated by hulking oil rigs, farms and
ranches. A few buffalo also can be found, remnants of the herds
that once roamed the prairie.
   ``This is a piece of American history,'' said Peter Abram, a
vacationing Barrie, Ontario, resident who toured the fort Saturday
with his wife, Irma. ``It's hard not to think of the poor buggers
who built this originally, the hardships they endured.''
   Fort Union dominated the economy of the Northern Plains until
the Army dismantled it more than a century ago when the American
Fur Trading Co. went out of business.
   The Army used some of the doors, windows and wood from the
civilian fort to build its Fort Buford just east of the trading
post.
   Nothing was left of the original trading post and reconstruction
depended on diaries, paintings and photographs for design and
detail, said Paul Hedren, superintendent of the 430-acre park.
   ``We've been faithful to the fort's original design as much as
possible,'' Hedren said. ``The fort you see today, we feel, is what
fur traders on the Missouri saw in the mid-1800s.''
   The centerpiece of the fort is the colorful Bourgeois House.
Finished in 1987, it now contains museum exhibits and
administrative offices.
   The whitewashed walls of the fort began going up this past
spring and were completed just in time for the dedication. Two
bastions housing cannons sit at two corners of the facility.
   Modern-day ``buckskinners'' dressed in clothing of the period
relived the past Saturday by peddling buffalo hides, beaver pelts
and beadwork at a tepee encampment near the fort.
   Joining in the festivities was a contingent of Royal Canadian
Mounted Police officers from Manitoba and Saskatchewan who appeared
in the distinctive garb of their 1870s predecessors.
   ``I'm a history nut, a buckskin nut, an Indian nut,'' said Jim
Bill Henderson of Jefferson City, Mo., who took part in ``living
history'' activities at the fort Saturday.
   Henderson, a Teddy Roosevelt look-alike who is working this
summer at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, attended the dedication
in a replica of the uniform Roosevelt wore in the Spanish-American
War.
   Nearly $4 million has gone into the reconstruction of the fort.
About $3.3 million came from the federal government and about
$500,000 was provided by local supporters called Friends of Fort
Union.

   A former mental patient apparently threw
her three young children to their death off a 100-foot bridge then
jumped in herself, police said.
   Seachers found the third body in the Tombigbee River on
Saturday, and police said homicide charges were likely against
their mother, Regina Moss Monroe, 22.
   Mrs. Monroe was listed in serious condition at a hospital where
she was treated for exposure and bruises.
   Police Chief Bill Taylor said authorities discovered Mrs. Monroe
along the banks of the river Friday, some 19 hours after she last
was seen atop the McCorquodale Bridge with her three children.
   ``She was sitting down in the water,'' Lt. Charles Burge said.
   ``We have some witnesses who saw her on the bridge, and she
apparently made some statements to the rescue squad regarding her
actions,'' said Taylor.
   Taylor said the body of Alicia Monroe, 5, was found downstream
from the bridge Saturday morning. The bodies of James Monroe Jr.,
3, and his sister Jessica Monroe, also 3, were found Friday.
   Mrs. Monroe was found in shallow water near the bridge where her
car, its motor still running and front doors open, was found
Thursday night.
   Mrs. Monroe's husband, James Monroe Sr., alerted police after he
came out of a store about 11 p.m. Thursday and found the car with
his wife and three children gone.
   Monroe flagged down a passing police car and told the officer
his wife had apparently driven off with their children, Burge said.
Monroe, 31, told police his wife had mental problems and had been a
patient in a mental hospital, said Burge.

   A stray bullet by an Israeli soldier killed a
3-year-old girl playing in a Gaza Strip refugee camp where troopers
battled stone-throwing Palestinians, Arab reports said Saturday.
The army confirmed the death but said it was checking the
circumstances.
   Masked Palestinians killed two Arabs suspected of collaborating
with Israeli authorities in the West Bank, stabbing one and hanging
the other in a school courtyard, the army and Arab reports said.
   At least 11 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire in
confrontations with the army in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials
said. Three others were shot and wounded in West Bank clashes,
radio and Arab reports said.
   The army said it was checking the reports of wounded.
   The reported deaths Saturday would raise to 535 the number of
Palestinians killed by Israeli troops or civilians since the
Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. In addition, 94
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs who suspected them of
collaborating with Israel. Thirty-eight Israeli Jews have been
killed.
   Bothina Adib Hejow, 3, was killed by a stray bullet from one of
the troopers who dispersed stone-throwers in the Khan Younis
refugee camp, Arab reports said. The reports said the girl was
playing in the camp's main road nearby when she was hit.
   The army said the girl was killed but it was still investigating
the circumstances.
   At least three others were shot and wounded in the Khan Younis
clash, doctors said.
   In the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, the largest West Bank
city, masked Palestinians repeatedly stabbed Murshed Kaniery, 55,
after accusing him of collaborating with Israeli security forces,
Arab reports said. He died later in a Nablus hospital.
   In Bidiya village near Tulkarem in the West Bank, masked Arabs
hanged 30-year-old school teacher Jamal Taha in his school's
courtyard, the reports said.
   The army confirmed the two deaths and said it was checking the
circumstances.
   Palestinians said the army imposed a curfew on Bidiya after the
early-morning killing and deployed hundreds of troops to search the
village and surrounding fields for the attackers.
   Also Saturday, troops dispersed a march of 200 Palestinian
activists in the West Bank Balata refugee camp. The army fired
bullets and used a gravel-spewing cannon to disperse the
demonstrators, Arab reports said.
   On Friday night in southern Lebanon, Israeli troops and allied
Lebanese militiamen shot and wounded a guerrilla whose unit planned
to infiltrate Israel, the army said. The wounded man was captured,
but his companions escaped.
   The clash occurred 1{ miles from the Israeli settlement of
Misgav Am near the Lebanese border in Israel's self-declared
security zone. It was the third incident in the zone this month.

   The Soviet Union will give Afghanistan
new weapons and aircraft if it confirms that more U.S. arms have
reached guerrillas fighting to overthrow the government, a Soviet
envoy said Saturday.
   Filip Sydorski, the third-ranking Soviet diplomat in Kabul, said
he could not confirm an Afghan general's statement that the Soviet
Union is supplying Afghanistan with new MiG-29 fighters and the
latest Sukhoi ground-attack jets to defend the country against a
Pakistani attack. However, he said the MiG-29s could be part of new
shipments.
   The Afghan government claims the Moslem guerrillas are backed by
soldiers from Pakistan, which provides headquarters to the
guerrillas. Pakistan denies its troops are involved.
   In his remarks on Austrian television, Sydorski said, ``I'm sure
if tomorrow some new American weapons would appear on the soil of
Afghanistan, maybe the day after tomorrow, or a week after that,
new kinds of weapons including new aircraft, maybe MiG-29 ...,
would also appear in this country.''
   U.S. officials have been quoted as saying the guerrillas will be
receiving new weapons to counter highly effective bombing attacks
by the Afghan air force.
   On Thursday, Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi, a member of the Afghan
Supreme Military Council, said a contract for Soviet MiG-29s and
Su-27 ground-attack jets had been completed.
   Soviet ambassador Yuli M. Vorontsov said in June that the Soviet
Union would be accepting an Afghan request for MiG-29s and Su-27s
if there was an escalation of fighting and border violations by
Pakistan.
   The United States and the Soviet Union are sponsors of the April
1988 Geneva accords. which provided for the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan on Feb. 15 and an end to outside
interference in Afghanistan.
   However, the Soviets and Americans have accused each other of
boosting arms shipments to their Afghan allies.

   Even in Loma, a tiny dot of a town near the
banks of the Missouri River, they found Jesse Murabito and took her
children away.
   Even after eight months of hiding and thousands of miles on the
``underground railway'' when she was starting to hope for a new
life, the legal system that she profoundly distrusts caught up with
her.
   ``All I wanted to do is keep my children safe,'' a sobbing Mrs.
Murabito said Saturday. ``The courts won't do it.''
   ``I don't know what I'll do now,'' she said.
   She fled New Hampshire in November with her 4-year-old son and
6-year-old daughter after a jury acquitted her ex-husband, Mark
Russell Murabito, of sexually molesting the daughter.
   A secret network that helps women in such situations spirited
her first to the South, then to a battered women's shelter in San
Francisco for three months and finally, in April, to Loma.
   ``They said they could get me to Alaska or to Loma, and I just
couldn't face Alaska,'' Mrs. Murabito, 40, recalled in an interview
with The Associated Press. ``They said they could guarantee me they
wouldn't find me in Alaska, but ...''
   On Friday afternoon, Chouteau County Sheriff Paul Williams, a
deputy and social worker Diann Button appeared at her front door
with a court order.
   ``That social worker said the children were confused,'' Mrs.
Murabito said, weeping and burying her face in her hands. ``They
weren't confused, they were terrified.''
   Williams said he learned earlier last week that Mrs. Murabito
might be living in the area when a local resident recognized her
picture from an article in a magazine.
   As for the children's reaction to the arrival of the officials
Friday, he said, they became upset only when their mother did.
   ``The children weren't bad until she started screaming and
hollering and saying, `You're not taking my children! You're not
taking my children!''' the sheriff said.
   The children have been placed in a foster home and a hearing is
scheduled Thursday. Mrs. Murabito was not taken into custody;
Williams said the civil warrant pending in New Hampshire could not
be enforced in Montana.
   Mrs. Murabito was jailed for a week in February 1987 during the
couple's bitter divorce in New Hampshire for refusing to tell a
judge the whereabouts of her children.
   Murabito, 34, was indicted in March 1988 on charges of sexually
abusing the daughter, but he was acquitted in November.
   A Superior Court judge in New Hampshire then stripped her of the
children's custody, awarding Murabito joint custody with the state.
Mrs. Murabito disappeared the same day with the children.
   Kellett, a lawyer for Murabito, said Friday night that his
client was ``very relieved and happy at the prospects of getting
the children back'' and planned to attend the hearing Thursday.
   Mrs. Murabito would not be specific about her flight from New
Hampshire, saying she wanted to protect the people who helped her.
She said she never knew full names of any contacts in the
underground network, nor whether the names she was given were real.
   Williams said his initial investigation shows she traveled in at
least six states, including Missouri and Ohio.
   Mrs. Murabito said that during her three months in the San
Francisco shelter, a therapist worked with her daughter and may
come to Montana to testify at Thursday's hearing.
   Mrs. Murabito was vague about why she was sent to Loma, a town
of about 80 people in the wheatfields and rangeland of
north-central Montana.
   Using the name Pat Gibeau, she said, she rented a small two-room
house on a dirt street and has worked since April at the Loma Cafe
and Motel.
   She said she quit her job Friday night and has contacted an
attorney through Nashua Rape and Assault Services, which has aided
her since 1986.

   The Trizna family had set up their nursery
for one baby, but got four: one screamer and three contents.
   Janis Trizna of Manassas gave birth to two boys and two girls
born eight weeks premature and delivered by Caesarean section
Thursday.
   ``They seem to be doing fine. We've got one screamer and three
content,'' Fairfax Hospital spokeswoman Brigid Noone said Friday.
   Mrs. Trizna and her husband, Michael, have two other children _
20-month-old Jessica and Michael, who turned 5 on Wednesday.
   Trizna said the latest are likely the last.
   ``I think six is plenty,'' dad said.
   The Triznas have a four-bedroom home and a station wagon that
seats, inconveniently, seven people.
   ``Mike's going to take some vacation and we're going to see what
we need,'' Mrs. Trizna said Friday. ``The nursery we had set up
only holds one crib, so we'll have to play musical rooms for a
while.''
   The babies _ Andrew Robert, who was 3 pounds, 14 ounces at
birth; Christopher Travis, 2 pounds, 10 ounces; Kathryn Mary, 3
pounds, 6{ ounces; and Lauren Elizabeth, 3 pounds, 6 ounces _
arrived within three minutes of each other.
   Mrs. Trizna is to be released from the hospital next week.
   And how is her husband?
   ``OK, I guess,'' he said. ``It hasn't sunk in yet.''

   State legislatures are under pressure to act
on a variety of issues, including abortion, lawmakers were told
during a national convention.
   The 5,000 delegates to the National Conference of State
Legislatures got the grim word from panelists and Bush
administration officials in dozens of sessions at the six-day
meeting, which ended Friday.
   Increased spending is the prescription for most of the ills, but
the states' economic future is clouded by large trade and federal
budget deficits, said Samuel Nunez Jr., Louisiana Senate president
pro tempore and president of the NCSL.
   Unfunded federal mandates have added billions of dollars in new
responsibilities for the states in recent years, Nunez said.
Federal welfare reform and changes in catastrophic health care and
nursing home legislation will also raise state costs, he said.
   A survey by NCSL staff showed that education makes up more than
50 percent of state budgets nationwide. The overall increase in
spending was 7.2 percent, up from 6.6 percent a year ago. Spending
on corrections rose 14.1 percent while the increase in Medicaid
costs was 10.4 percent.
   ``The greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in
the New England states and in New York and New Jersey, places that
just two years ago were faring better than most states,'' said Lee
Daniels, NCSL president-elect and minority leader of the Illinois
House.
   While some delegates claimed a continuing erosion of state
sovereignty by the federal government, one of the highest-profile
topics at the convention was an issue many legislators would rather
leave to the U.S. Supreme Court _ abortion.
   About 600 demonstrators, half of them chanting pro-choice
slogans and the other half singing hymns and carrying anti-abortion
placards, marched downtown Monday as delegates arrived for a social
event.
   In a July 3 decision in a Missouri case, the high court
implicitly invited states to enact their own laws on abortion 16
years after the court made abortion legal.
   ``It's not our business,'' Joan Lawrence, state representative
from Ohio, told a crowded session on Wednesday. ``We're going to be
making a serious mistake if we step into this swamp.''
   But Massachusetts state Sen. Paul White told lawmakers they
won't be able to steer clear of the issue.
   ``We're stuck with the fact that this is an issue that has to be
dealt with,'' White said. ``It isn't going to evaporate. It isn't
going to disappear.
   ``I don't think this is an issue about polls... or holding your
finger in the wind to see which way the wind is blowing,'' he said.
``I think this is an issue that you have to look within yourself.''
   U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, U.S.
Secretary of Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and former
Environmental Protection Agency administrator William Ruckelshaus
also had advice for lawmakers.
   Sullivan called for more state spending to lower infant
mortality and Skinner urged states to raise local gasoline taxes
and spend more on highways. Ruckelshaus, now head of a large waste
disposal company, said lawmakers should show more backbone in
finding sites for solid waste landfills.
   Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore said his department will
design a ``road map'' for a national energy policy, but said many
of the policies must be implemented at the state level.

   Thunderstorms drenched the East Coast on Saturday from North
Carolina to southern New England, flooding roads and causing other
problems and prompting flood watches for many other areas.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell from Florida to the
central Gulf Coast and from the southern High Plains to Minnesota
and the Dakotas. A few showers and thunderstorms fell over Idaho
and western Montana.
   Fair to partly sunny skies prevailed across the rest of the
nation.
   The torrential East Coast storms, which developed along a
stationary front, flooded subway tunnels and roads in New York
City, delaying trains and tieing up traffic.
   Nearly 3 inches of rain fell in New York between midnight and 3
p.m. Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT
included 1{ inches at Norfolk, Va., 1 inch at Salisbury, Md., and
nearly an inch at Dover, Del.
   A small stream and urban flood watch was in effect for all of
southern New Jersey, parts of eastern Pennsylvania, southern
Vermont and southeast New York state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58
degrees at San Simeon, Calif., to 101 degrees at Phoenix. The low
for the Lower 48 states Saturday morning was 36 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   Sunday's foreast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
across the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region, the eastern Gulf Coast,
the northern Atlantic Coast states, the middle Atlantic Coast,
upstate New York and northern New England.
   Fair to partly sunny skies were expected across the rest of the
nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the lower 90s in southern
Florida, southern Texas, southern New Mexico and the northern High
Plains; over 90 degrees across much of the nation west of the
Rockies, with readings above 100 degrees in the Southwestern
deserts; in the 70s across the northern Atlantic Coast; and in the
60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast.

   Hundreds of Eastern Airlines union members on
Saturday launched a 26-day series of rallies and other actions to
gain support for their strike, which has been weakened by
picket-line crossings and courtroom setbacks.
   The rally near Eastern headquarters was attended by a crowd
estimated at 300 to 500 people.
   ``These people over across the street have done a good job in
their psychological warfare. Now they're out there telling the
world it's over. Well, it's not over,'' said Charles E. Bryan,
District 100 president of the Machinists union. ``So hang in there.
There'll be good news coming.''
   Henry A. Duffy, national president of the Air Line Pilots
Association, joined Bryan and other Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants on the first blocks of a ``moving picket line'' march.
   ``Journey for Justice,'' read T-shirts worn by many of the
picketers.
   The rally opened a 26-day series of parades, motorcades,
rallies, petition drives and lobbying planned in 13 states.
   ALPA, which represents pilots at nearly every major carrier, has
been discussing a nationwide job action to show support for Eastern
workers.
   Duffy said the unions want to ensure that the public understands
that the strike, which began March 4, is still on. The unions also
want to spur congressional action, pressure President Bush to
intervene and revitalize solidarity throughout the national labor
movement, he said.
   Duffy said labor leaders will urge Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, to push a House-passed bill calling on Bush to
appoint a presidential emergency board that could send the unions
back to work while trying to reach a settlement. Duffy called that
action the best hope for ending the strike.
   Bush refused in the early days of the strike to intervene.
   ``This is an important strike, not only for ALPA and Eastern
employees, but for the national labor movement,'' Duffy said,
adding that what he called the anti-union management tactics of
Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo must be stopped. He also
predicted Eastern won't survive unless its veteran employees return
to work.
   ``The publicity turned against us, but not to the point it's
going to stop the strike,'' Duffy added in an interview.
   Discussion a week ago by the pilots' union leadership about
ending the strike spurred the most picket-line crossovers since the
walkout's first week. An estimated 250 union pilots returned to
work last week, prompting Eastern to stop hiring new pilots, and
about 140 flight attendants crossed the lines.
   Eastern said Friday it has enough pilots for its plan to rebuild
despite the strike, but Bryan said Eastern, because of a shortage
of mechanics and spare parts, doesn't have enough flight-ready
planes.
   John J. Bavis, Eastern's ALPA local chairman, said Eastern's
announcement was meant to hurt union morale.
   ``They want to scare the hell out of people, trying to break
us,'' Bavis said.
   Bryan, who said only 2 percent of his union's 8,500 members have
returned to work, said the pilot crossovers ``has been damaging to
the morale of the people'' because the Machinists emphasized the
importance of pilot support. The Machinists struck after 1{ years
of federal mediation failed and were joined by the pilots and
flight attendants.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell declined to comment on the union
rally and denied that Eastern had claimed victory.
   ``There are no winners in a strike,'' he said. Friday's
announcement was ``just to state the facts'' that no more pilots
are needed, Matell said.
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
five days into the strike, plans to rebuild to an airline
two-thirds of its pre-strike size. The company's plan for its
creditors said it will fly 800 daily flights with 1,700 pilots by
the end of the year.
   Eastern has 350 daily flights, compared with nearly 1,100 before
the strike.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said more than
600 union pilots, of 3,600, have returned to work, joining 300
newly hired pilots who completed training and 700 to 800 in
training.

<HEAD>Noriega Marks 6th Anniversary of Rule, Opposition Wants Him Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's
de facto leader, on Saturday quietly celebrated the sixth
anniversary of his command of Panama's Defense Forces.
   No public ceremonies marking the anniversary were announced by
the Noriega-controlled government or Defense Forces.
   The anniversary followed several confrontations between U.S.
military personnel and Defense Forces troopers in recent days.
   On Friday, a Panamanian patrol briefly detained U.S. military
police in four vehicles in the Curundu area near the Panama Canal.
Earlier last week, American troops blockaded Fort Amador, which
contains both U.S. and Panamanian military facilities.
   Noriega has rebuffed all U.S. efforts, including economic
sanctions, to force him to step down.
   Washington has exerted pressure to remove Noriega since two
federal grand juries in Florida indicted him on drug trafficking
and money laundering charges in February 1988. He denies the
charges.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington Friday
that the Bush administration ``would not rule out'' seizing Noriega
and taking him to Florida to face drug trafficking charges. But
Fitzwater said Bush was not contemplating such a move at this time.
   Opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon told a news conference
Saturday the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Venezuela believe
that Noriega is the major obstacle to democracy in Panama.
   Calderon said he and Guillermo Ford met last week with the
presidents and other officials in those South American nations.
Calderon and Ford were the two vice presidential candidates on the
opposition slate in the May 7 elections.
   Calderon said the three presidents ``have a very clear idea that
popular sovereignty and national sovereignty cannot be dissociated
and they consider that only a free people can really be sovereign.''
   International observers said the opposition won the May election
by a landslide, but the government annulled the balloting a few
days later saying there had been vote fraud. Guillermo Endara was
the opposition's presidential candidate.
   The opposition has proposed a plebicite this month to allow
Panamanians to decide whether they want Noriega to continue in his
command.
   Noriega said Friday the proposal was tantamount to turning
Panama into ``a colony that accepts arrogance, vassalage and
indignity.''
   He made the comment in a speech at a parade of thousands of
troopers and paramilitary civilian units ending a 10-day exercise
called ``Zap the Intruder.''
   U.S. officials say the U.S. forces have the right to conduct
their own exercises under the 1977 Panama Canal treaties to assure
the security of the canal.
   Noriega claims the United States wants to abrogate the treaties,
which provide for the canal to be turned over to Panama at the end
of 1999.

<HEAD>Burmese Opposition Leader Gives Up Hunger Strike, Britain Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Office said Saturday that Burmese
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi had given up a hunger strike and
that her British husband and their children would return to Britain
in September.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, leader of Burma's main opposition political party,
is under house arrest by the military government. Her husband,
Oxford professor Michael Aris, flew to Burma to see her July 22 and
had not been allowed contact with British diplomats since. Britain
lodged a formal protest Aug. 4.
   On Saturday, Aris met with the British consul in Rangoon at a
Burmese military guest house in the presence of three Burmese
officials, the Foreign Office said.
   The Burmese government had said that under terms of Ms. Suu
Kyi's house arrest, members of her family are forbidden to make
contact with foreign embassies.
   Ms. Suu Kyi had been reported on hunger strike but no details
had emerged.
   The Foreign Office said that Aris told the consul his wife had
abandoned a protest hunger strike but would remain under house
arrest.
   She gave up the 2-week-old hunger strike after ``a solemn
assurance'' from Burmese officials about the safety of her
followers in the National League for Democracy, the Foreign Office
said.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, the daughter of slain independence leader Aung San,
has urged the military government to hold free elections and end
their 27-year rule in the former British colony. She was one of the
most popular speakers in nationwide protests for democracy last
year.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking anonymously, said Burma was
being unacceptable when it insists that Aris consider himself under
the same restrictions as his wife if he chooses to stay in the
country.
   The couple's sons, Alexander, 16, and Kim, 13, subject to
similar restrictions, would be returning to Britain to continue
their education.
   Aris said he was applying for his visa to be extended beyond
next Saturday when it expires, the spokesman said. ``Depending on
his wife's continued well-being he intends to return to the United
Kingdom in early September.''
   The Foreign Office said the conditions of the meeting were ``not
entirely satisfactory,'' although the Burmese representatives did
not intervene.
   And the spokesman condemned the Burmese government's continued
``muzzling'' of Ms. Suu Kyi, the daughter of slain independence
leader Aung San.

<HEAD>13 Killed In Balloon Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DARWIN, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen people were killed Sunday in a
hot-air balloon accident in central Australia, police said.
   They said the balloon fell out of the sky at 7:08 a.m. over
desert land about 10 miles south of the airport in the town of
Alice Springs, about 800 miles south of the port of Darwin.
   It was at least the second fatal hot-air balloon accident in
nine days. Another occurred in Baton Rouge, La. on Aug. 5.
   Police were interviewing witnesses, who were on another balloon
nearby, but had not yet determined the cause of the accident.
   Police said all on board the balloon died. It was not
immediately known how how high the balloon was traveling before the
accident.
   The Australian Associated Press said the hot-air balloon often
took a dozen tourists at a time on rides.
   Alice Springs, near the center of Australia, is popular with
tourists who journey through the Australian outback.
   On Aug. 5, pilot Robert A. Mock killed Saturday when his balloon
deflated at 3,000 feet during a national competition in Baton
Rouge, La.
   Armond Edwards, an investigator for the National Transportation
Safety Board, said Monday that Mock's balloon was leaking before
take-off.

   A horse trying to get to a fig tree in
its owner's yard fell into a swimming pool and treaded water for a
half-hour in the deep end before he was rescued.
   Fadge, a 9-year-old, 1,100-pound Arabian, was rescued Friday
from the 30-by 18-foot pool, where he had to stay afloat in 8 feet
of water until rescue crews could save him.
   The horse was discovered by 3-year-old Ashley Aceves, whose
father, Henry, owns both the horse and the house.
   ``At first I thought it was a paper horse, because horses aren't
supposed to be in swimming pools,'' said Ashley.
   Aceves had to drain the pool so that Fadge could stand until
rescuers arrived. Firefighters and animal control officers used a
tarpulin and ropes to pull the animal out, but only after they
coaxed him to the shallow end.
   The horse was exhausted and disoriented, but otherwise unhurt,
said Animal Control officer Leslie Byrnes.
   ``It's a good thing we got here when we did because he was going
to drown,'' Byrnes said. ``He had given up and probably thought he
was going to die in there.''
   Aceves said the animal was trying to reach the fig tree in the
yard.

<HEAD>Officials Remain Skeptical About Future Of Fire Season</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of firefighters shoveled and
sprayed to corral nearly 93,000 acres of burning Idaho timber
Saturday, and the weather cooperated with occasional rain showers
and lower temperatures.
   ``We're getting the proverbial scattered showers,'' said Boise
National Forest spokesman Pete Buist. ``It hasn't rained on all the
fires, but the places where it does, it helps.''
   Officials remained concerned that more lightning and higher
temperatures could start fires again.
   ``It's still looking highly suspicious out there, like there are
some thunderstorms coming in,'' said Marcia Nelson, fire
information officer for the Payette National Forest to the north.
   A 45,000-acre complex of fires that incinerated part of the town
of Lowman northeast of Boise two weeks ago was 75 percent contained
Saturday, but was burning heavily within fire lines, Buist said. It
could be completely contained by Monday night, he said.
   To the north, another complex of blazes reached 20,380 acres and
made short runs inside its perimeter, although Buist said it could
be totally contained by Sunday. About 1,200 Army personnel were
called in last week to help ``backfire'' forest, creating a
blackened buffer between the blaze and cabins in the Warm Lake area.
   The number of firefighters working statewide dropped from 10,000
on Friday to 8,000 Saturday, said Vic Standa of the Boise
Interagency Fire Center, the federal hedquarters for fighting
wildfires. Buist said Boise National Forest would keep its 5,100
firefighters for now to gain a handle on the blazes.
   A 9,700-acre complex that raced toward the old mining town of
Warren for a time was stalled, as firefighters sprayed the flames
to keep smoky debris from being blown into unscorched ground, Buist
said.
   ``We're focusing on the hot spots and wetting down 450 feet
inside the fire line because it's still so touchy,'' he said.
   Several fires in an 11,000-acre complex were contained by
Saturday and almost controlled, Nelson said. The fires had burned
along the Main Salmon River, which is used heavily by rafting
parties during the summer.
   Fire crews were demobilizing from a 6,800-acre fire in the Nez
Perce National Forest in the north-central part of the state.
   So far this year, 42,000 fires have destroyed 1.4 million acres
in the United States, about half of the 2.8 million acres blackened
by 63,000 blazes in 1988, Standa said.

<TEXT>
   Christian gunners and their Syrian
enemies pounded Beirut and surrounding areas Saturday in one of
their most vicious duels in five months of fighting. At least 22
people were reported killed and 110 wounded.
   The wanton exchange of firepower across about a fourth of the
country prompted the Moslem prime minister to appeal directly to
Arab leaders on Saturday ``to stop this insane, merciless torture
of Beirut and its population.''
   ``We're left in the blowing wind with no roof above us,'' Prime
Minister Salim Hoss said earlier on the Voice of the Nation radio.
Hoss heads the Moslem Cabinet vying for power with a Christian
military Cabinet under Gen. Michel Aoun.
   According to his office, Hoss made urgent telephone pleas to
Syrian President Hafez Assad as well as to King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, King Hassan II of Morocco and Algerian President Chadli
Bendjedid. Fahd, Hassan, and Bendjedid lead an Arab League effort
to end the bloodshed.
   In France, the Foreign Ministry said it asked Syria to end
``with all urgency'' its bombardments in Lebanon. It said it is
sending envoys to Damascus, Moscow, Washington, Tunisia and the
Vatican to discuss the situation.
   The Moslem-run Voice of the People reported that an orphanage in
Moslem west Beirut was hit Saturday night, and three children were
hospitalized in critical condition.
   The French and Argentine embassies were hit by Syrian rockets,
and one French Embassy guard was slightly wounded, security sources
said.
   They also said the residences of U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy
and French Ambassador Rene Ala in suburban Yarze, east of Beirut,
came under shellfire for a second night in a row, but no casualties
or serious damage were reported.
   Nearly the only movement left on the deserted streets of Beirut
was dust pushed by the summer wind, mingled with clouds of ashes
from buildings and nearby forests that burned out of control. All
but about 200,000 of the city's 1.5 million people have fled.
   ``Luckily, Beirut has been deserted. Otherwise, the barrage
would have killed hundreds,'' said one police source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Aside from a brief lull early Saturday, the shelling was
continuous from Friday morning, bringing the toll since March 8 to
608 killed and 1,624 wounded by police count. Shells and rockets
rained down on some areas at the rate of 60 per minute, security
sources said.
   Hoss' government is backed by the Syrians and their 40,000
troops in Lebanon. The Syrian soldiers came under terms of a 1976
peacekeeping mandate, but Aoun has said they back Moslem forces and
has vowed to drive them out of the country.
   Aoun leads about 20,000 mainly Christian troops.
   Aoun issued a statement Saturday calling on the United States
and other members of the U.N. Security Council to impose a
political and economic boycott on Syria.
   ``The intransigence of the Syrian regime should be confronted
and the Syrian army should be made to withdraw from Lebanon
altogther so this country can regain its unity and end terrorism on
its land,'' Aoun said in his appeal, broadcast on Christian radio
stations.
   The Moslem-run Barbir Hospital near Beirut's dividing Green line
took several direct salvos that started a fire in the three top
floors of the eight-story hospital during Saturday's exchanges.
   ``We've managed to rescue all patients and remove them to the
bunker, but we cannot receive any more casualties,'' said a doctor
who answered telephone calls. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   One salvo crashed into an empty room on the fourth floor of the
Cavalier Hotel in Moslem west Beirut. Several foreign reporters and
photographers were staying at the hotel, but no casualties were
reported there.
   The latest round of fighting in the 14-year-old civil war broke
out after Aoun blockaded illegal ports operated by Syrian-backed
militias south of Beirut to salvage lost customs dues. The Syrians
and allied Moslem forces retaliated by besieging and shelling the
Christian enclave.
   Witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said Aoun's
gunners, using U.S.-designed 155-mm howitzers, scored direct hits
on a dozen Syrian artillery emplacements and multi-barreled rocket
launchers.
   The witnesses said Aoun's gunfire targeted Syrian emplacements
in west Beirut, the southern slum of Bourj el-Barajneh, the
southeastern Aramoun hills, the mountain range east of the capital
and the eastern Bekaa valley.
   Syrian forces shelled most of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave that includes east Beirut and communities to the north,
security sources said.
   The fighting covered roughly a fourth of Lebanon's 4,015 square
miles.

   An anti-drug activist slain when a gunman opened
fire through her window was described Saturday as a martyr by
friends who vowed after her funeral to continue fighting to rid
their neighborhood of drugs.
   ``I know my wife, wherever she's at, is looking down on us and
will give us the strength we need so we can continue the fight,''
Carlos Hernandez said as he and hundreds of supporters arrived at
Cypress Hills Cemetery behind the hearse bearing Maria Hernandez's
pink coffin.
   ``Drug dealers gotta go!'' the crowd chanted along the two-mile
walk from the family's home in the borough of Brooklyn. Some
carried signs with slogans like: ``Death to drug dealers!''
   Mrs. Hernandez, a 34-year-old mother of three, was killed
Tuesday by a gunman who fired five bullets into her bedroom from
the street as she dressed for work.
   Authorities believe it was in retaliation for the anti-drug
efforts of the victim and her husband, who has received numerous
death threats.
   Mrs. Hernandez' wake was interrupted Friday when a bomb threat
was telephoned to the funeral home. Mourners were evacuated but no
bomb was found.
   ``We march through the streets of Brooklyn because we believe
that Maria's spirit has and does and will make a difference in our
community,'' the Rev. Charles Plock told mourners at St. John the
Baptist church Saturday. ``It will strengthen our resolve and stir
our community.''
   Among those attending the funeral Mass was Mayor Edward I. Koch,
who went to the pulpit and said the answer to the drug problem
won't be the military, the police or more drug education efforts.
   ``Those most important to the elimination of the drug scourge
are people like Maria and Carlos Hernandez,'' Koch said. The city
should tell Hernandez and others with the courage to take a stand,
``You are not alone,'' he added.
   After the funeral, friends and supporters gathered in front of
the Hernandez's home. Police estimated as many as 300 people
marched on foot, while behind them were dozens of cars.
   Jacqueline Perez, a family friend, said she and her children
were marching so that Hernandez would know ``that people are with
him. This has to be stopped, one way or another.''
   ``She really died a martyr,'' said a 28-year-old administrative
assistant and marcher who declined to give her name, saying she is
active in the fight against drugs in her own neighborhood.

<HEAD>Report: Chinese Student Leader Predicts New Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese student leader who fled after
pro-democracy demonstrators were killed in Beijing said he escaped
by hiding under timber in the back of a truck, a London newspaper
reported Sunday.
   The Sunday Express reported that Wu'er Kaixi, 21, and his
girlfriend, student activist Liu Yan, 19, were now living on the
outskirts of Pasadena, Calif., in a hideout it claimed was guarded
by the CIA.
   It said We`er was interviewed Friday at the hideout.
   The newspaper quoted Wu`er as saying that his escape was aided
by Hong Kong students and the CIA. It did not disclose any further
details of his escape.
   The Express said Wu`er predicted that China's communist
leadership would be toppled within three years ``if an incident
does not provoke it sooner.''
   If 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, dies soon,
``it could be a signal for the people to come out on the streets
again,'' Wu`er was quoted as saying. The demonstrations in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square were sparked by the death of former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang.
   Wu'er was quoted as saying that his network of contacts in China
estimate that 3,000 people were killed when the army stormed the
square on June 3-4, and that 120,000 have since been arrested or
executed.
   Xinhua, China's official news agency, has said nearly 100
soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while
about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. Chinese
witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may
have been as high as 3,000.
   Wu`er captured worldwide attention in a televised confrontation
between hunger-striking student leaders and Premier Li Peng in the
Forbidden City shortly before the army assault.
   ``I was just a student, out of hospital, but I had no fear of Li
Peng,'' he was quoted as saying. ``He is a devil but he did not
frighten me. I told him to start democratic reforms and not delay.''
   Wu`er said he was in the square when tanks rolled in.
   ``Students tried to reason with soldiers who were firing like
madmen, bayoneting young men and women,'' he was quoted as saying.
``I was put into an ambulance with two dead students ... As we sped
to hospital, I saw the tanks firing their machine guns into the
crowd.''

<HEAD>East Germany says Berlin Wall to Stay</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Berlin Wall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany on Saturday defended the Berlin Wall,
built 28 years ago to block East Germans from fleeing to the West,
and said hopes for the removal of the barrier are ``illusory.''
   Neues Deutschland, the newspaper of the East German Communist
Party, said the wall is ``a step toward peace'' and repeated the
government stand that it will remain in place as long as the reason
for its construction exists.
   Sunday is the anniversary of the construction of the wall on
Aug. 13, 1961.
   President Bush issued a statement Saturday calling the wall
``the relic of a bygone era and a failed policy.''
   ``We observe this sad anniversary with renewed determination to
overcome the division of Berlin and of Europe,'' Bush said in the
statement from Camp David, Md. He said he hoped for a Soviet
response that would make Berlin, divided into East and West Berlin,
``a place of cooperation, not a point of confrontation.''
   In its commentary, Neues Deutschland accused the West of trying
to ``economically plunder and destabilize East Germany.''
   After World War II and the division of Germany, hundreds of
thousands of people fled from Soviet-controlled East Germany until
the concrete and barbed-wire wall was built. The East German
economy struggled and stumbled as workers, scientists, artists and
intellectuals escaped to the West.
   Once in West Germany, the East Germans qualify for immediate
citizenship and social assistance.
   Another flow of East German refugees has been moving recently
through communist Hungary, which has dismantled much of its border
barriers with Austria.
   East Germans can gain permission to travel to Hungary with
relative ease and an estimated 1,500 have gone to Hungary this
summer and then escaped through Austria into West Germany.
   As many as 400 other East Germans are seeking refuge at West
German embassies in Budapest, Prague and East Berlin and seeking
exit visas. West Germany has allowed them to stay in the embassies
but on Tuesday it closed the doors of its East Berlin mission
saying it was crowded and could not accommodate any more people.
   Last week, officials of both East and West Germany were
encouraging the East Germans to return home and seek legal means of
emigrating.

<HEAD>Laszlo Willinger, Hollywood Photographer, Dead at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian-born photographer Laszlo Willinger,
who profiled such stars of Hollywood's golden era as Joan Crawford
and Clark Gable, died of heart failure, his publisher said
Saturday. He was 83.
   Willinger died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Tuesday, said
publisher Edward Weston.
   A professional photographer since he was 16, Willinger devoted
his career to taking pictures of illustrious personalities, and was
recognized as one of Hollywood's top photographers.
   ``The only thing that was expected of me was to make images that
the press would choose to print over everyone else's,'' Willinger
said in an interview last year. ``You must realize that there were
5,000 pictures available on any major star. To get printed, yours
had to be the best.''
   Willinger was born in Budapest, Hungary, on April 16, 1906.
While a teen he ran his first studio in Berlin. At 19 he went to
Paris, where he managed the portrait studio of the Keystone Agency,
also known as the Talbot Studios.
   He opened his own studio in Vienna, Austria, when he was 23.
Among his European subjects were Sigmund Freud, Maurice Chevalier
and Josephine Baker.
   But with war brewing, Willinger left Europe for Hollywood in
1937 and joined MGM studios.
   ``I don't think that at any time in history more people so
talented on every level had ever come together as in the Hollywood
of those decades,'' Willinger said of the 1930s and 1940s.
   Willinger said his favorite photo subjects were Miss Crawford,
Vivien Leigh and Gable. ``They knew what was expected of them,''
Willinger said. ``These stars not only cooperated, they were eager.
Some actors didn't understand this, and you never heard from them
again.''
   Willinger left MGM in 1944 and shot stock photography and
advertising. He worked for 40 years with FPG, a New York photo
agency that stocked some 50,000 of Willinger's transparencies.
   Willinger is survived by his wife, Yvonne. Funeral arrangements
were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Shrimpers Ticketed Under New Trawling Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALVESTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard ticketed six shrimpers
for violating new trawling-time restrictions intended to keep sea
turtles from drowning, authorities said Saturday.
   Five shrimpers in Galveston and one in Freeport were issued
citations for trawling without turtle excluder devices during
30-minute restricted periods, said Coast Guard spokesman Don Merwin.
   The new regulations being rigorously enforced since Friday night
require shrimpers to limit trawling to 105-minute intervals as
outlined by a Coast Guard time chart or use the devices, which are
designed to allow sea turtles to escape from shrimping nets.
   The devices are big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides
that turtles can swim through.
   Shrimpers who elect not to use the devices have to pull their
nets from the water during the 30-minute intervals when trawling is
prohibited.
   ``I would think that a vessel that has its nets in the water
during those periods will be a good candidate for boarding,'' Coast
Guard spokesman Nicholas Sandifer said in Washington.
   The Coast Guard has been broadcasting the time schedules and is
warning shrimpers before each 30-minute ban goes into effect,
Merwin said.
   Shrimpers out during the 30-minute intervals are being asked to
pull in their nets for inspection. Those without the devices are
fined.
   The maximum fine for a first and second offense is $8,000. The
maximum fine for a third offense is $12,000. Fines are levied by
the National Marines Fisheries Service, Merwin said.
   The Coast Guard is patrolling areas from Cameron, La., to
Freeport.
   The order to enforce the limited trawling option was issued at 6
p.m. Thursday. Three hours later, the captain of a shrimping vessel
off the Florida coast was cited after a Coast Guard boarding crew
observed that it was trawling illegally, Coast Guard officials said.
   Shrimpers who have fought against using the excluder devices are
concerned that the regulations implemented by U.S. Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher are so complicated they will be hard to
follow.

   Four armed fugitives agreed
Saturday to release three hostages in return for a plane to
Paraguay, but they refused to hand over the captives when the plane
turned back because of darkness, police said.
   Police on a highway in south-central Brazil continued to
surround the armored car where the fugitives held the three hostage
late Saturday.
   ``We're back to square one,'' said Jairo Pires, a spokesman with
the Sao Paulo State Security Department, said in a telephone
interview.
   The kidnappers, two married couples, had agreed to trade their
captives for the aircraft and a pilot Saturday, police said.
   But after the plane took off from Presidente Prudente Airport,
635 miles southwest of Rio, the pilot turned back, saying it was
too dark to land on the highway, according to police.
   The kidnappers began their crime spree on Aug. 3 when they
abducted a boy from his home in Goiania, 852 miles northwest of Rio.
   Their motive was not clear, armed robbery and kidnappings for
ransom have increased in recent months.
   Six days after the kidnapping, police found the kidnappers'
hideout on the outskirts of Goiania. Police exchanged the boy for
$42,000, the armored car, a driver and three local television
reporters.
   After releasing one of the reporters, the kidnappers headed for
the Goiania Airport, where authorities refused to exchange the
hostages for an airplane.
   Police then chased the armored car 500 miles through three
states. During one stop at a roadside cafe, one kidnapper stepped
out of the armored car and held a pistol to a hostage's head.
   The chase ended early Friday when the kidnappers stopped on a
highway near Presidente Prudente and demanded a helicopter in
exchange for their three hostages.
   An Air Force helicopter was summoned from Brasilia to a nearby
airport, but the helicopter pilots refused to fly the couples
unless they surrendered their grenades, machine gun and two
shotguns. Police then contracted a twin-engine plane.
   About 100 heavily armed police continued to surround the armored
car and sharpshooters aimed their rifles at the vehicle's small
windows.
   The three local television reporters who volunteered to take the
boy's place at the beginning of the drama were identified as
Solange Franco, Monica Calassa and Carla Monteiro. The kidnappers
later released Monteiro.
   The standoff was the third in four months in which criminals
took hostages.
   In early July, six armed men hijacked a packed passenger bus in
the northeastern state of Bahia after an unsuccessful bank robbery
attempt.
   After being chased 200 miles across the back woods of
northeastern Brazil with three hostages, police killed three of the
fugitives.
   In April, three bank robbers in a remote northeastern town
robbed a bank, took five hostages and fled by plane 1,200 miles to
the Amazon.

   Neither the 18-year-old driver, Paulette Roberts of Birmingham,
nor her 14-year-old passenger was injured when the car smashed
through the window of a Wal-Mart store, police said.
   Roberts was traveling fast, but police did not plan to file any
charges, said Cpl. J.N. Jones. The two were sent home.
   Several people were taken to hospitals, Jones said. At least 13
people were injured, he said.
   A 3-year-old girl suffered a head injury and was in stable

   A man may have suffered multiple fractures and a young woman
received cuts to her face and may have suffered a back injury,
Jones said.

<HEAD>Tabloid Makes His Day; Clint Eastwood Accepts Libel Damages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clint Eastwood has accepted undisclosed libel
damages from a British tabloid newspaper that reported Sunday it
had published false reports about the actor's private life.
   Eastwood accepted an apology for libelous articles published in
the News of the World on July 9 and ``a large sum'' in libel
damages and legal fees, said a statement agreed to by the actor and
News Group Newspapers.
   The amount of the settlement was not disclosed.
   Eastwood, who is in London completing a movie titled ``White
Hunter, Black Heart,'' said Saturday that the newspaper ``has
recognized its mistake and I appreciate that.''
   ``The apology was the most important thing to me,'' he said. ``I
didn't embark on this to make a profit, and whatever money I end up
with after all this I shall donate to charities.''
   Eastwood's lawyers issued a writ against the newspaper on
Friday. An apology published in Sunday editions of the country's
top-selling weekly tabloid said the articles were ``untrue and
should not have been published.''
   It was the latest in a series of libel awards by British
publications, particularly the racier tabloids, on wrong or
unprovable stories about the private lives of well-known
personalities.
   In the biggest such award, the tabloid Sun in December was
ordered to pay rock singer Elton John $1.75 million.

<HEAD>Lebanese Shiites Commemorate Holy Day</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Shiite Moslems in
southern Lebanon commemorated the holy day of Ashura Saturday with
many striking their heads with the flat edge of their swords or
chains until they drew blood.
   Ashura, marking the death in battle of Shiite saint Hussein in
A.D. 680, is the holiest day of the year for the world's 100
million Shiite Moslems.
   Scores of white-robed Shiites, bleeding from head wounds and
chanting religious verses, led a procession through Nabatiyeh.
   Iran, a Moslem country with fundamentalist Shiite leaders, will
commemorate Ashura Sunday.
   Ashura is derived from the Arabic word for the number 10. It
refers to the first 10 days of the first month of the Islamic lunar
calendar, Muharram, culminating in the tenth day, the day of
Hussein's death.
   The division of Islam into Shiite and Sunni groups developed
after the death in 632 of Mohammed, the founder of the faith.
Mohammed's closest followers determined that his companion, Abu
Bakr, be declared the next leader of Islam.
   A minority of Moslems challenged the dicision and argued that
the leadership should be dynastic and should therefore have gone to
Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of Mohammed, who had no sons.
   Ali did become leader but after his death in 661, a dynasty
known as the Ummayids and based in Syria declared it was the ruler
of Islam.
   Hussein, the son of Ali, challenged the Ummayid rule and the
Ummayids representing the mainstream Sunnis sought to crush
Hussein's movement.
   In 680, the Ummayid forces surrounded Hussein and his followers
and killed them in a battle at Kerbala, about 100 miles south of
Baghdad in modern Iraq.
   But the victory did not crush the Shiites and Hussein's death
added an element of passion to Shiism, which venerates martyrdom.
   Shiites follow the same major rules and rites as the Sunni
Moslem majority of about 800 million, including five prayers a day,
the pilgrimage to Mecca, and fasting in the holy month of Ramadan.

<TEXT>
   The Celtics' Larry Bird, who missed nearly all of
the National Basketball Association's last season, will become the
first professional athlete in any team sport to earn more than $6
million in a single year, sources told the Associated Press on
Saturday.
   Bird, 32, negotiated the sum before undergoing surgery on his
feet in October with two years left in his five-year contract. He
had been earning $1.8 million a year, far less than the $3
million-plus of such NBA players as Michael Jordan of Chicago and
Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks.
   The negotiations were complicated by the NBA's salary cap, which
will be $9.8 million per team this year. The Celtics reportedly
agreed to a two-year contract extension under which Bird's salary
and bonus will jump to between $6 million and $7 million during the
1991-92 season.
   Bird's agent and attorney, Bob Woolf, confirmed Saturday that
the 6-foot-9 forward had signed an extension through 1991-92. Bird
and Celtics general manager Jan Volk were not available for comment.
   Bird, a nine-time All-Star, led the Celtics to three NBA titles
in the 1980s. He has averaged nearly 25 points per game in his
10-year career.

   A blind man who said he held up a bank
after losing his Social Security money will not be prosecuted for
bank robbery but for a lesser charge of burglary and grand theft,
authorities said.
   Richard Dunbar, 34, was arrested for investigation of holding up
a downtown Bank of America branch of $950 on Thursday.
   Dunbar told police he became desperate after public agencies
were unable to help him when he lost his government check, said
officers who questioned the man.
   He told police he planned to use the money to buy food and pay
for overnight shelter.
   ``It was a choice between robbing the bank or killing myself,''
said Dunbar. ``I was at the end of my rope and I was frightened.''
   Dunbar will be charged with second-degree burglary and grand
theft when he is arraigned Monday, Jerome Benson, chief of the
district attorney's criminal division, said Friday.
   Authorities decided to charge Dunbar with the lesser crimes
because of the circumstances and the man's blindness, Benson said.
   Both charges could be reduced to misdemeanors, the prosecutor
said. Bank robbery is a felony that carries a sentence of two to
five years.
   Dunbar was being held in the city jail.
   According to police accounts of the robbery, Dunbar handed a
teller a note demanding money. Another employee slipped out of the
bank and called a police officer.
   It was not until Dunbar was arrested at gunpoint that officers
and the teller realized he was blind, Benson said. Dunbar was not
armed.

   The high court in the Maldives on
Saturday sentenced a Sri Lanka-based Maldivian businessman to death
for leading a failed coup in the Indian Ocean archipelago, the
Maldivian government said.
   Seventy-five people, including 68 Sri Lankan Tamil mercenaries,
were convicted of participating in the Nov. 3, 1988 coup attempt.
Sixteen people, four Maldivians and 12 Sri Lankans, were given
death sentences. The other 59 received prison terms ranging from
nine to 38 years.
   The condemned men will be hanged, said Ahmed Saleem, deputy
director of the Maldives Information and Broadcasting Department.
   ``Everybody here feels those guilty of this grave crime must be
severely dealt with, there should be no leniency,'' Saleem said by
telephone.
   The court found businessman Abdullah Luthufi guilty of
organizing the attempt to overthrow President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.
The attempt was crushed by Indian paratroopers after Gayoom
requested help. At least 17 people, mostly local residents, were
killed in the fighting.
   The Maldivian government has said the convicted Sri Lankans were
mercenaries who were members of a Tamil separatist group.
   Chief Justice Moosa Fathy, heading a three-judge panel, read the
sentences at a hearing after nearly two months of trial.
   No dates were set for the execution.
   The court has asked the convicted men to pay $14 million as
compensation for deaths, injuries and property damage, the
government statement said.
   There is no higher court of appeal in Maldives, a string of
coral islands in the Indian Ocean. Only President Gayoom can
commute the sentences. The last death sentence in Maldives was
carried out in 1951 by a firing squad.
   The Maldives archipelago is about 500 miles southwest of Sri
Lanka and roughly the same distance south of India. The country is
made up of about 2,000 islands, but only about 200 are inhabited.

<TEXT>
   Residents on both coasts coped with summer downpours Saturday as
New Yorkers slogged through ankle-deep water and Southern
Californians were told to be ``water tight'' while an aqueduct is
repaired.
   Thunderstorms last week that tore up the aqueduct that supplies
three-quarters of Los Angeles' water also damaged hundreds of homes
in California and Arizona. On Saturday, Eastern storms flooded
roads, small streams, subway tunnels and the roof of a Hartford,
Conn., apartment building where collapsing ceilings chased out
eight families.
   ``I've lost everything _ my furniture, my clothes, my car,''
said Santiago Caballero, a 63-year-old unemployed farmworker who
said he saved for 10 years to buy his modest home in Yuma, Ariz.,
across the state line from Southern California.
   Another mudslide was reported at Yellowstone National Park in
Wyoming, one mile west of where 15 mudslides occurred two days ago.
   Colorado Springs, Colo., reported street flooding from 3 inches
of rain that fell during an hour and a half. One parking lot was
under 2 feet of water and many cars were stranded.
   A stationary front along the middle and northern Atlantic coast
brought the torrential rain in the New York City area, with 2.9
inches from midnight to 3 p.m. Up to 10 inches of rain fell Friday
at the eastern end of Long Island, the National Weather Service
reported.
   More than an inch of rain fell in one hour in New York early
Saturday morning and again in an afternoon hour, but the amounts
were well short of the one-hour record of over 2 inches set in
1983, said meteorologist Ben Scott.
   That word would have provided little solace, however, to
thousands of New York pedestrians who found themselves wrapped in
sheets of falling water or to subway riders whose packed trains
were stalled by power shutoffs caused by the flooding.
   Suburban travelers had problems too. In Pelham Manor just north
of the city, 6.66 inches fell between midnight and 3 p.m., closing
roads.
   Up to 5 inches of rain fell in the New Haven, Conn., area before
tapering off around 4:30 p.m. Friday, said Todd Mendell, a
hydrologist at the River Forecast Center in Hartford.
   Firefighters found 5,000 gallons of water collecting on the roof
of a Hartford apartment builing where several ceilings collapsed
Friday.
   ``When we found the water was coming down through the ceiling
into the light fixtures we called the building department and began
to shut off the power and the building department suggested we
evacuate the building,'' said firefighter Lester McBride.
   Forecasters said rain could continue through the weekend on the
affected parts of the East Coast and in Southern California.
   Since Wednesday, widely scattered downpours have inundated areas
from San Diego to Las Vegas, as well as Arizona's Yuma County.
   A 1,000-foot stretch of the huge Los Angeles Aqueduct, 180 miles
north of the city, buckled, cracked and popped Thursday after it
was flooded by heavy rains and clogged with debris.
   Dennis Williams, a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
engineer, said crews working around the clock would need about two
weeks to repair the aqueduct. Repairs could take longer if it
continues to rain, he said.
   ``What we're asking is that everyone take to heart our
conservation program and be water tight,'' said Rich Atwater,
director of resources for the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California.
   The repairs were expected to cost at least $500,000, and highway
damage in the Sierra Nevada was reported at more than $1 million.
   Affected residents spent Friday and Saturday pumping water and
shoveling mud from homes.
   ``We're not going to recover from these storms for a long, long
time,'' Yuma police spokesman Jan Schmidt said. ``We were totally
underwater.''
   Some of the most serious damage was done to agriculture, Mono
County, Calif., sheriff's spokeswoman Gail Merritt said.
   ``There's some folks over there with a huge field of garlic just
ready to pick and it's all gone,'' said Benton farmer Bud Orris.

   About 500 people marked the approaching 20th
anniversary of the Woodstock music festival by camping in the rain
Saturday at the late Max Yasgur's farm.
   A mix of original festival-goers, teen-agers, yuppies and
remnants of the hippie days set up camp in the field nearly 75
miles northwest of New York City to mark the coming anniversary of
Woodstock.
   Rain turned parts of the farm into mud reminiscent of the Aug.
15-17, 1969, festival, which about 400,000 people attended.
   The land's current owners, Charley and Debbie Gelish, allowed
scores of people to camp out on a field without charge, but asked
vendors selling food, T-shirts and souvenirs for donations to
repair the field and spruce up the property.
   Traffic was moving along smoothly, Bethel Supervisor Allan Scott
said. Roads near the site had been converted to one-way trafic to
improve trafic flow.
   A Woodstock commemorative concert is scheduled for Thursday,
Friday and Saturday at the Imperial Resort Hotel in nearby Swan
Lake. The resort hopes to draw 4,000 people to the event.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Dismissed on Removal of Dead Man's Corneas Against Family
Wishes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coroner may have acted callously in removing
a dead man's corneas for transplant despite his family's
objections, but he did not violate anyone's rights, a federal judge
ruled.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on Friday dismissed a $1.5
million lawsuit against the Hamilton County coroner's office
brought by Steven Brotherton's survivors.
   The judge expressed concern at the coroner's ``arbitrary and
insensitive actions,'' but said he had no option but to dismiss the
lawsuit, which also named an eye bank and an organ procurement
center.
   Spiegel said the family was mistaken in making property claims
in the case, but told them they could sue in a state court in which
the defendants can be accused of causing severe emotional distress.
   Defendants in the lawsuit included the coroner, Dr. Frank
Cleveland, the Cincinnati Eye Bank for Sight Restoration and the
Ohio Valley Organ Procurement Center.
   Brotherton's wife, Deborah, refused Bethesda North Hospital's
request for an organ donation following her husband's death, saying
her husband was opposed to the practice.
   Cleveland later allowed a technician from the eye bank to remove
Brotherton's corneas, even though his wife's objections to organ
donations were included in hospital records of Brotherton's death.
   Clear corneas from dead people are used in transplant operations
to replace corneas that are clouded by cataracts.
   Spiegel said the hospital made no effort to relay Deborah
Brotherton's objections to Cleveland. He also said the coroner
routinely allows removal of corneas without looking at medical
records or documents belonging to the dead people from whom the
corneas are taken.
   Cleveland was not available for comment.

<HEAD>Report: HUD Pattern of Favoritism Not Confined to GOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While well-connected Republicans received
political favors from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Democrats also benefited, according to a report in The
New York Times.
   Democrats did not realize financial benefits as big as some GOP
members, but former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce's favoritism was
not limited to his own party, the Times reported in Sunday editions.
   ``Believe me, it wasn't just Republicans at this party,'' an
unidentified senior housing official told the Times.
   In one example the Times cited, a political supporter and friend
of U.S. Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, was awarded a $5 million grant
and federal subsidies for 500 apartments.
   Brooks was head of the Government Operations Committee, which
monitors federal agencies.
   The Times said that in the last three years HUD awarded millions
of dollars in grants from a discretionary fund to projects in the
home districts of U.S. Reps. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who was then
majority leader; Tony Coelho, D-Calif., former majority whip, and
Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee.
   None of the awards was illegal, the newspaper said.
   Republican consultants, developers and members of Congress
secured favors from HUD by appealing to the political loyalties of
HUD managers, the Times said.
   Democratic representatives also approached HUD officials for
grants and subsidies, but more often they took advantage of their
majority in Congress by imposing their wishes on housing
appropriations bills, the Times said.

published a statement Saturday condemning the Soviet-led invasion
of Czechslovakia in 1968 that crushed a liberal communist
government.
   A statement in the Communist Party newspaper Nepszabadsag from
the reform group in the city of Debrecen called on the party's
Central Committee and the government ``to condemn ... the forcible
intervention'' by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies,
including Hungary, 21 years ago.
   The statement said the group also agreed with a declaration
being circulated in Czechoslovakia urging the release of political
prisoners.
   ``We are closely following the attempts of the democratic forces
in today's Czechoslovakia,'' the statement said.
   The Czechoslovak leadership has said people signing the
declaration face fines and imprisonment. But Czechoslovak sources
in the West say at least 15,000 people have signed the proclamation.
   The Debrecen statement came nine days before the 21st
anniversary of the invasion. Imre Szokai, Hungary's deputy chief of
international relations with other communist parties, on Friday
said the invasion was ``essentially wrong.'' Czechoslovakia is a
member of the Warsaw Pact. With the exception of Romania, all other
members _ the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany, Hungary and
Poland _ participated in the invasion.
   Six independent Czechoslovak groups plan peaceful marches and
silent protests on the Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion to voice
their desire for ``freedom, democracy and human rights,'' an emigre
source in Vienna said Saturday.
   Palach Press, a newsletter published in London by Czechoslovak
emigres, reported the six groups were circulating a statement that
said:
   ``The approaching Aug.21 is a source of concern for many
responsible and level-headed people among us.
   ``The past year has shown clearly that Czechoslovak citizens no
longer wish just to wait, especially since major changes for the
better are taking place around us.
   ``It is ... to be expected that this year many people will wish
to express their disagreement.''
   The changes it referred to are reforms under way in the Soviet
Union and some Soviet-bloc countries including Hungary and Poland.
   The six groups circulating the statement were not identified.

   Two men were trying to swim across Lake Erie
this weekend, which has not been accomplished in nearly 14 years.
   Bob North and Harvey Snell strode into the 76-degree water at
6:37 p.m. Saturday at Long Point, Canada. They were expected to
reach Freeport Beach in northwestern Pennsylvania, 26 to 30 miles
away, in about 20 hours.
   Each man was covered with heavy coatings of lanolin. Four boats
and two kayak chase-boats were following the Erie-area swimmers.
   North's wife, Louise, said her husband had a restless night
before the swim.
   ``The hardest part is the waiting,'' she said.
   The last person to swim across Lake Erie was Pat Budny, who left
from Canada and walked ashore on the U.S. side on Aug. 20, 1975.

   A 4-year-old girl who died in
searing desert heat wasn't found for weeks because authorities
didn't know she was missing, police said.
   Nicole Zuganos, who was found Thursday, apparently had been
riding with her father, John Zuganos, 27, when their car became
stuck in early July, Lt. Bob Schubert said.
   Police believe the father died of heat exhaustion while trying
to free the car, Schubert said. Zuganos' body was found July 10,
but not identified until Wednesday. Family members then asked
police to check on Nicole's whereabouts, and her body was found
hours later, Schubert said.
   High temperatures in the first two weeks of July typically were
well above 100, the National Weather Service said. The high for
July 4 was 120.

   The White House, sifting through offers, hints
and statements from the Middle East about American hostages in
Lebanon, says the United States wants to ``let these issues play
out for a few days and see what happens.''
   ``We get a lot of different statements, some optimistic, some
pessimistic, some critical, some crazy,'' said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We watch them all, analyze them all and in a sense, the public
and (the press) all are seeing the process pretty much as it is.''
   The latest development was a conditional offer of assistance
from the spiritual leader of the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah,
believed to be the umbrella for Shiite Moslem factions holding most
of the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon.

   Tens of thousands of Poles stopped work for an
hour in a Solidarity-organized strike, while the Soviet ambassador
met with Communist leaders and officials in Moscow spoke against
upheaval in Poland.
   It was the first Soviet government comment on the parliamentary
maneuvering in which Solidarity is trying to form a non-Communist
government to lead the Soviet Union's largest East bloc ally.
   The independent Solidarity trade union movement staged the
strike in Gdansk province to demand more pay and an end to
Communist Party influence on management.
   Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov held an unusual series of
meetings in Warsaw on Friday, including sessions with the chairmen
of the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party. The parties
traditionally have been allied with the Communists, but Solidarity
is courting them to form a government.

   Women run about twice the risk of men of
becoming depressed, and it is misdiagnosed in them up to half the
time, a new report said.
   Cultural factors are a major reason for the higher incidence,
and a tendency of physicians to interpret depressive symptoms as
physical illness causes misdiagnosis, said Ellen McGrath, head of
the group that drafted the report.
   Findings of the American Psychological Association National Task
Force on Women and Depression were discussed Fridayat the
association's annual meeting.
   The task force examined several studies, which have consistently
found that women run twice the risk of depression as men, McGrath
said.

   The Justice Department is hardening its
assessment of the damage done by public disclosure to its
investigation of suspected Soviet spy Felix S. Bloch.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said flatly Friday
that the July 21 disclosure that the 54-year-old U.S. diplomat was
under investigation had compromised the investigation.
   ``There is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case,
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation,
did compromise the investigation,'' Runkel said.
   He didn't explain how the investigation had been compromised.
However, Runkel's assessment was much stronger than one he
delivered July 31 when asked about the impact of unprecedented
publicity on an espionage investigation that so far has produced no
criminal charges.

   Traders on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange cheered when the Dow Jones industrial average finally _ if
only temporarily _ cracked its all-time high. The reaction was only
half-serious.
   To the professionals who buy and sell stocks on Wall Street,
records are fine but are not the pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow.
   ``Traders are glad to see a record because it does hold out the
promise of a better market, which brings more business,'' Robert W.
Seijas, a partner in the NYSE-member firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern,
said after the market closed Friday. ``But the record itself
doesn't hold a lot of magic for the traders.''
   On Friday, the widely followed Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks briefly topped the record high of 2,722.42 set
Aug. 25, 1987, before finishing down 28.64 points at 2,683.99.

   Voyager 2, now 12 days from its close
encounter with Neptune, has made another discovery that thrilled
scientists: two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar system's
fourth-largest planet.
   ``There is a mood of total elation here,'' said astronomer Rich
Terrile, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're really just ecstatic. ... Everything
we've hoped to look at we're going to get to see.''
   Early Friday, Voyager 2 photographed the two partial rings,
called ``ring arcs.'' They are arc-shaped belts different from the
complete rings that encircle Saturn, Uranus and Jupiter.
   Since early July, Voyager has discovered four small moons
orbiting Neptune in addition to the previously known moons, Nereid
and Triton.

<TEXT>
   There's not much complaining going on about the
``summer doldrums'' on Wall Street this year.
   Or if there is, it's hard to hear it above the din of record or
near-record highs in stock prices and increasingly optimistic
appraisals of the state of the nation's economy.
   Things are even looking a little brighter for the securities
industry, one of the few sectors of the economy that felt severe
ill effects from the crash of 1987.
   In the last few weeks just about all the major stock-market
indicators have reached new peaks, surpassing the highs they set
two years ago before stock prices collapsed.
   The laggard Dow Jones average of 30 industrials nearly made it
to new high ground as well in the past week, before afternoon
selling on Friday turned it back.
   Stock investors could hardly fault the news background, which
showed a 0.4 percent decline in the producer price index and a 0.9
percent increase in retail sales for July.
   Those government figures suggested more strength in the consumer
economy, and at the same time less upward pressure on inflation,
than analysts had generally expected.
   Indeed, most of the evidence lately has tended to dispel fears
of an impending economic slump of major proportions.
   ``That possibility looks extremely remote,'' said John Connolly,
an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The economy is
decelerating gradually, not rapidly.''
   ```Soft landing' is still the best bet,'' observed Maury Harris,
economist at PaineWebber Inc.
   Analysts say Wall Street's fortunes have benefited in particular
from signs since late spring that individual investors, slow to
heal from the wounds of the '87 crash, have at least been returning
in significant numbers.
   ``Retail activity is at its best level since the crash,''
observed Larry Eckenfelder, who follows the brokerage industry for
the firm of Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``It's early, and a severe market downturn could nip it in the
bud, but it looks as though the individual is coming back to the
stock and bond markets.''
   At the close of business on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials stood at 2,683.99, up 30.54 from the week before but
still shy of the closing high of 2,722.42 it set on Aug. 25, 1987.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index up .63 at 192.27; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market up 5.06 at 462.48, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index up 4.54 at 380.64.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 200.81 million shares a day, up
from 182.43 million the week before and the heaviest total this
year.
   The pace of activity belied August's one-time image as the
slowest period of the year on the Street _ a pattern that has been
fading for years as investing institutions have come to play a
bigger and bigger part in the markets.
   Individuals still carry a lot of weight, however _ if not
through direct purchases and sales of stock, then through moving
their money in and out of mutual funds that in turn invest it in
the stock market.
   ``The public has finally shifted to the buy side on stock mutual
funds for the first time since the crash,'' said Martin Zweig in a
recent edition of his advisory The Zweig Forecast. ``If the public
comes back here, it could be a big plus.''

   In the beginning, there were digital
computers. They were big, slow and very stupid. A half-century
later, digital computers are very small and fast, but they're still
hopeless idiots compared to humans.
   The main problem was, and still is, that computers just can't
think.
   But what if computer circuits could be made to resemble our
brains? What if they could learn from their mistakes?
   Hundreds of tiny companies have sprung up in the past three
years hoping to answer, and cash in on, those questions with an
approach called neural networks after the neurons that are the
basic structure of the human nervous system.
   Carlos Tapang, a 36-year-old Filipino physicist who left Intel
Corp. to start Syntonic Systems Inc., shipped what he believes is
the first commercially available neural network chip to
Electrodyne, a Japanese company, in May.
   The chip is called DENDROS-1, a reference to dendrites, the
highly branched filaments of nerve or brain cells that let the
cells communicate. It simulates neurons by combining a variety of
signals to come up with a single result.
   Tapang compares it to measuring the flow of water through a vast
network of different-sized pipes by emptying them into a single
pool. Such a system of computing values is called ``analog,'' which
implies a continuous form of measurement, like the sweep second
hand on a watch.
   Digital computers, like digital watches, chop time and numbers
into tiny bits and add them up one at a time. In fact, ``bits'' are
the smallest unit of information in the binary system that is the
``brain'' of a digital computer.
   The great advantage of today's digital computers is that they
can add those bits incredibly fast, even if it is done only one bit
at a time.
   There is some evidence from research on animals and people that
the neural cells in our brains use a kind of digital system to
transmit signals. These on-off pulses, called spikes, confused
early researchers and led some to believe that the brain relied on
a digital model to process information.
   Instead, they found it was only a tiny portion of a complex
electrochemical system that channels signals the way Tapang is
trying to imitate. ``A neuron by itself is dumb, but the totality
of that network of neurons in our skull is probably the most
intelligent machine in the universe,'' he said.
   The key word is ``network.'' It is the interaction of neurons in
our brains that gives rise to thought, not the action of a single
neuron.
   In that sense, Tapang said, digital computers are doomed to be
electronic dunces because their chips were designed to be solitary
devices called central processing units, channeling all operations
through one electronic ``pipe.''
   Even if CPUs are connected, the result is only a faster dunce.
   However, some computer scientists and industry analysts are
skeptical.
   Neural networks will ``be a fine addition to what we've got now
but they'll just supplement it,'' said Esther Dyson, editor and
publisher of Release 1.0, a New York-based computer newsletter.
``They'll never replace the mathematically precise logic of a
digital system.
   ``I fundamentally disagree with this `bated breath' attitude in
the industry about the next breakthrough being neural chips or
networks. They're good at things like pattern recognition but still
cannot cope with our kind of `fuzzy thinking.' A lawyer might ask,
`Colonel North, why did you do that?' and accept a fuzzy answer,
but a computer can't.''
   One San Jose, Calif.-based company, Synaptics, has used neural
network technology to develop what it calls a Silicon Retina. An
array of photo sensors emulates the light receptors in the eye, and
an analog computer processes the image for display on a video
monitor.
   Tapang uses capacitors to simulate neurons, which rely on
chemicals to transmit signals between synapses. Capacitors store
and release electricity in much the same way. DENDROS-1 has one
fixed connection and 22 variable ones that simulate synapses. It
can be layered with other chips to create an overlapping network of
communicating capacitors that ``fire'' signals to each other.
   As in the brain, the firing of one electronic neuron affects the
others. An important feature is each neuron's ability to damp its
neighbors, creating a pattern. The variable interaction is a
crucial part of the network.
   The applications for Tapang's chip include things like pattern
recognition.
   Dyson agrees the best uses for neural chips and networks would
be tasks like analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes and
hunt for oil or gas, analyzing brain waves, identifying
fingerprints or other classification chores.
   But she remains skeptical about their potential. So does Dave
Waltz, of Thinking Machines Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., which makes
a supercomputer built of up to 64,000 digital processors harnessed
together.
   The problem with neural networks is that you can't keep
expanding them, Waltz said. ``The whole field of neuropsychology
says that increasing the scale means greater complexity. If you
scale up the size of a neural net you increase the complexity of
solving the problems you give it.''
   Mathematicians claim they can use mathematical functions to
achieve the same effect as neural networks, and such formulas can
be readily understood, he said. ``The main problem with neural
networks is that we just don't understand how they really work any
more than we understand how the brain really works.''
   Waltz believes the boom in neural network research will slow but
that interest will continue, because it is ``easier to write
programs for neural nets than for any other system. Almost anybody
can play the game.''
   ``The digital age is over and the analog era is here,'' Tapang
said. ``The next step is making computer chips that can communicate
with each other and this is a step in that direction.''

<TEXT>
   They're ready to start the celebration here on
Wall Street, but the guest of honor still hasn't shown up.
   The missing party in question is the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials, one of the few widely recognized measures of stock
price trends that hasn't reached a record high this summer.
   f it doesn't put in an appearance before long, some would-be
revelers worry, the hors d'oeuvres might wilt and the punch might
go flat.
   Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index, the benchmark
against which most professional investors gauge their results,
surpassed its high from the summer of 1987 a couple of weeks ago.
   The separate indicators for the New York and American Stock
Exchanges and the over-the-counter market all have lately topped
their pre-crash peaks. So have measures of mutual-fund performance,
which matter especially to the great majority of individual
investors.
   So, too, has the Dow's sister average that tracks transportation
stocks.
   But official certification that the stock market has fully
recovered from the crash that occurred in August, September and
October of '87 has been left to await a new high in the Dow.
   As close as it came last Thursday and Friday, the average's Aug.
25, 1987 close of 2,722.42 still stood as the record when the
weekend arrived. The average fell 28.64 points Friday to finish the
week at 2,683.99.
   By what right has this stubborn creature held up the
festivities? Well, analysts say, it has the privileges of seniority
if nothing else.
   ``The Dow Jones industrial average is the granddaddy of all the
market indices,'' noted analysts at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
a recent commentary on the situation.
   ``Developed at the end of the last century, it was designed to
be easy to calculate in those days of inkwells and green eyeshades.
Most of the newer market indices are broader in scope and track
many more individual issues.''
   To be fair about it, the average has been modernized over the
past decade or so to include such stalwart companies of the 1980s
as McDonald's, Coca-Cola and American Express among its 30
components.
   Still, analysts say, the average remains dominated by
``smokestack'' industrial companies whose stocks have lagged of
late because of intensified international competition and, most
recently, worries about a possible recession in this country.
   ``The DJIA being a laggard is somewhat unusual,'' observed
Edward Nicoski at the brokerage firm of Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood
Inc. in a recent commentary. ``But because of the
economic-sensitive nature of many of its components, it should not
be totally unexpected.''
   Since the market peak two years ago, the biggest drag on the Dow
average has been one of its most illustrious members, International
Business Machines, which remained last week more than $55 below its
1987 high of $174.87.
   Analysts say the Dow also has suffered from a special factor _ a
dearth of takeover interest in most of its components, because of
their size. Behemoths like General Electric and Philip Morris are
more likely to be acquirers, as they have been, than acquirees.
   If the industrials had attracted bids the way issues in the
transportation average _ NWA, UAL and so forth _ have lately, the
story would have been much different.
   In fact, members of the industrial elite have become takeover
targets in the past _ for example, General Foods, from Philip
Morris in 1985. On those occasions, objections have often been
raised that the Dow was overstating the market's strength.

   Despite the brains and technology that
manipulate today's investment strategies, the financial markets
have once again demonstrated their pack-like behavior.
   At first it seemed as if encouraging signals about the economy
would propel the stock market to a total recovery from the
cataclysmic plunge of October 1987.
   Indeed, so much attention was riveted on the undulating Dow
Jones average _ the last major stock index that hadn't decisively
pierced its pre-crash high _ that the index's half-hourly moves
Friday were followed like rounds of a boxing match.
   But for reasons that perhaps could be best described as a sudden
change of heart by the buyers, bond prices reversed themselves
after a hearty runup and stocks blindly followed, sending the Dow
average and other indexes lower.
   Sophisticated strategists who had put themselves on a limb by
gambling that prices would rise had to scramble to sell, their
earlier thinking rendered useless by the mass transformation of
buyers into sellers.
   Some economists found what seemed to be a logical explanation
for the sudden shift in psychology by reassessing the government
reports on inflation and consumer spending released Friday.
   The report on a 0.4 percent drop in wholesale prices in July,
for example, initially suggested investors shouldn't worry about
inflation _ a good reason to buy stocks and bonds. But it was
viewed later as a sign that interest rates could decline
precipitously and inflation could surge anew _ a good reason to
sell.
   The market gyrations coincidentally came the same week the big
savings and loan bailout was launched, marking the biggest bailout
ever by the U.S. government.
   Stock and bond investors largely ignored the signing of the
legislation by President Bush, even though critics said the $285
billion rescue of the nation's broke savings &amp; loans could ripple
through the economy in the form of unaffordable mortgages, lower
property values and lower interest rates for certificates of
deposit.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _United Airlines was targeted in a $5.4 billion takeover attempt
by investor Marvin Davis, who sought unsuccessfully to buy
Northwest Airlines earlier this year. Two other big airlines,
fearing they might be next in line for a takeover, strengthened
their defenses: USAir Group Inc. sold a stake to investor Warren
Buffett, and American Airlines toughened its ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan.
   _A sudden surge in picket-line crossings undermined the strength
of a 5-month-old strike against Eastern Airlines. Although union
activists said the majority of strikers remained committed, the
crossovers raised questions about how much longer the walkout could
be effective.
   _Debts dragged a discount retailer and two swank department
stores into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Dart Drug Stores
Inc.'s move stemmed partly from its high-yield ``junk bond''
obligations and the costs of a major remodeling; L.J. Hooker Corp.,
subsidiary of Australia-based Hooker Corp. and owner of the B.
Altman &amp; Co. and Bonwit Teller stores, hired turnaround specialist
Sanford Sigoloff to manage the debt-plagued company.
   _The takeover business demonstrated its increasingly
transnational reach. Ex-Treasury Secretary William Simon disclosed

<HEAD>Dow Industrials Flirts With Record, Finishes Lower</HEAD>

   Traders on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange cheered when the Dow Jones industrials average finally _
if only temporarily _ cracked its all-time high. The reaction was
only half serious.
   To the professionals who buy and sell stocks on Wall Street,
records are fine but aren't the pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow.
   ``Traders are glad to see a record because it does hold out the
promise of a better market, which brings more business,'' Robert W.
Seijas, a partner in the NYSE-member firm Lasker, Stone &amp; Stern,
said after the market closed Friday. ``But the record itself
doesn't hold a lot of magic for the traders.''
   On Friday, the widely followed Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks briefly topped the record high of 2,722.42 set
Aug. 25, 1987, before finishing down 28.64 points at 2,683.99.
   It was the second straight day the Dow flirted with the all-time
best. On Thursday, when it broke through the level for the first
time since before the October 1987 market crash, traders cheered _
some facetiously, according to floor brokers.
   ``I think most of us are sophisticated enough to know that
records are only good for the media, for the newspapers and
television. It doesn't mean anything to the pros,'' said one
commission house broker, who asked not to be named.
   Although some broader market indicators have been at record
levels for days or weeks, the Dow Jones industrials' approach to
the record is considered the final sign of Wall Street's recovery
since the Oct. 19, 1987, crash, when the Dow fell 508 points.
   Traders said that despite an extended rally that has seen a 25
percent runup this year, the stock market remains tempered by the
memory of the crash.
   ``It's much more cautious now,'' Seijas said. ``Prior to the
crash it was getting to be an easy game _ no one feels like that
now.''
   But unlike pre-crash 1987, inflation isn't rising, the dollar is
up and interest rates have fallen. Stock prices marketwide are at
about 13 times corporate earnings, compared with about 20 times in
1987, analysts said, indicating that stocks are not overvalued.
   ``Statistically speaking, all the numbers are pretty good,''
said James J. Maguire, chairman of Henderson Brothers Inc., another
member firm. ``All these factors should meld into an environment
that will be conducive to higher levels of equity prices.''
   Economic news swayed the markets on Friday as the Labor
Department said wholesale prices slumped 0.4 percent in July, the
biggest drop in three years and far greater than many economists
had predicted.
   The government also reported that retail sales in July rose a
healthy 0.9 percent following two straight monthly declines.
   The combination of slow-but-steady economic growth and low
inflation _ what economists are calling a ``soft landing'' _ have
helped strengthen the bond and dollar markets and lent optimism to
the stock market, experts said.
   A slowing economy decreases the likelihood that the Federal
Reserve will push interest rates higher to help curb inflation.
That is seen as good for corporate profits and for bond prices,
which move inversely to interest rates.
   The reports sparked an early rally in the bond market, which
sharply reversed later in the day on speculation that the Fed might
not be inclined to push interest rates lower. The yield on the
bellwether 30-year Treasury bond finished at 8.15 percent, up from
Thursday's 8.05 percent.
   In addition, the dollar surged against major currencies in
foreign exchange, rising to 141.90 Japanese yen in New York from
139.80 on Thursday.
   For the brokers and traders streaming out of the New York
exchange after the closing bell Friday, the hope of a stronger
economy means that individual investors _ who pay higher
commissions than institutions _ may be tempted to buy stocks again.
   Despite the rally, individuals have avoided stocks because of
the crash and better investments in other areas such as money
markets. But as those rates have fallen recently, there has been
some renewed interest in stocks.

<HEAD>Some Passengers Asking Not to Fly in DC-10s, Companies Say</HEAD>

   A number of would-be passengers are asking not
to be booked on flights using DC-10 jetliners, following two
explosive engine failures within a month on the jumbo jet, several
agents and carriers say.
   Since the July 19 crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux
City, Iowa, which killed 111 people, about 400 customers have asked
not to be booked on DC-10s, Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United at
its Chicago headquarters, said Friday.
   Doughty said the number compared with the total 150,000
passengers United carries daily.
   The McDonnell Douglas-built aircraft is used by some 50 airlines
around the world.
   There have been several other incidents involving DC-10s since
the Sioux City crash, which followed an explosive engine failure.
   In one of the latest incidents, a Northwest Airlines DC-10 made
a safe emergency landing Thursday in Denver after a so-called
``uncontained engine failure'' in which flying parts punched holes
in the housing of the airliner's tail-mounted engine.
   U.S. majors American Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta Air
Lines, Eastern Airlines, Northwest, Pan Am and United fly a total
of 166 DC-10s, and about 300 more are flown by foreign carriers.
   American, the nation's largest airline, flies 61 DC-10s,
followed by United with 55 and Northwest with 20.
   Northwest has worked with about 25 customers who have expressed
concern about the aircraft, said Bob Gibbons, a Northwest spokesman
in Eagan, Minn.
   ``It's not indicative of any kind of hysteria,'' he said. ``I
think most people basically want to be reassured.''
   As a matter of policy, Northwest will not allow changes of
aircraft on discount tickets where any changes normally are
prohibited, Gibbons said.
   At United, nearly all fliers expressing aircraft preferences are
accommodated, unless the only choice on a particular route is the
DC-10, Doughty said. Even requests by passengers with discount-fare
tickets _ which usually prohibit changes in flight plans _ are
being granted, he said.
   Nearly all the worried customers are vacationers and other
leisure passengers, as opposed to seasoned business travelers,
airlines and agents say.
   Michael Edelman, an agent at JB's World Travel in Manhattan,
reported that about a quarter of the agency's customers are
requesting non-DC-10 flights.
   ``Slowly but surely, we're getting more requests from people to
stay off DC-10s,'' he said.
   Other travel agents, like William Cooper in Pompano Beach, Fla.,
say they're seeing more apprehension about air safety in general,
not limited to specific types of aircraft.
   That concern has been heigtened by other recent incidents
involving aging aircraft and other jets, said Cooper, president of
Adventure Travels.
   On Thursday, a Trump Shuttle Boeing 727 carrying 56 people
skidded to a halt in an emergency landing in Boston after its nose
gear failed to extend. And on Friday, a Braniff Airways flight from
New York to Florida made a safe emergency landing at Newark, N.J.,
after a warning light on the 727 indicated a hydraulics problem.
   ``There's obviously some apprehension out there with what's
happening,'' Cooper said. He noted that senior citizens and
families with young children are among his most concerned customers.
   In response to questions on Thursday, Federal Aviation
Administrator James B. Busey said regulators had no hard facts to
prompt a grounding of the nation's DC-10 fleet.
