   A leading renegade military officer
sought in coup plots against President Corazon Aquino was arrested
early hursday as he left a restaurant in a Manila suburb, officials
said.
   Former Lt. Col. Reynaldo Cabauatan, wearing civilian clothes and
a disguise of eyeglasses and a goatee, was unarmed when military
agents took him into custody in Pasay City shortly after midnight,
according to Brig. Gen. Pantaleon Dumlao.
   Dumlao said Cabauatan tried to get away and urged officers to
shoot him. But he stopped when one of them placed a gun to his head
and threatened to shoot, Dumlao added. He said earlier that
Cabauatan offered no resistance.
   Cabauatan's brother, Jimmy, and a friend were detained with him
outside the Japanese restaurant but were released, officials said.
   Mrs. Aquino praised the military for the capture and told
reporters the arrest ``will lead to greater stability in this
country.''
   Dumlao said agents surrounded the restaurant and waited outside
for five hours for Cabauatan to leave after getting a tip he was at
a party there.
   He said they were not certain it was Cabauatan because of his
disguise, so agents approached him and saluted. Dumlao said they
grabbed Cabauatan when the former colonel returned the salute.
   Dumlao said Cabauatan, a former Philippine Constabulary officer,
was taken to Constabulary headquarters at Camp Crame for
interrogation. He said Cabauatan faced three possible criminal
charges, but he did not specify the charges.
   Cabauatan was the most prominent anti-Aquino military figure
seized since the December 1987 capture of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan, leader of an Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt that
left at least 53 people dead.
   Honasan escaped last April from a prison ship in Manila Bay and
remains at large.
   Cabauatan was sought after a January 1987 coup attempt, when
renegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in the
capital. The government called it an attempt to restore ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos to power.
   Cabauatan also took part in an abortive putsch at The Manila
Hotel in July 1986 and was believed to have been linked to an attack
on the stockade at Manila's Fort Bonifacio in April 1987.
   Cabauatan went underground and was later dropped from military
rolls as absent without leave. In statements to reporters, he
claimed to have organized the Nationalist Army of the Philippines to
continue his struggle against Mrs. Aquino.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, told reporters Thursday there were ``very strong
indications that the money being used by this group came from
ex-President Marcos.'' He did not elaborate.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos identified Cabauatan as one of the
major military figures sought in armed attempts against the
president.
   Oliver Lozano, a right-wing lawyer, said he spoke by telephone
with Cabauatan minutes after his arrest and said Cabauatan ``will
cooperate so the truth will come out.''
   Lozano said Cabauatan opposed violent attempts to overthrow the
government but sought change ``through peaceful, democratic and
legal means.''
   He said Cabauatan supported a campaign by former Lt. Col. Rolando
Abadilla to forge ``genuine reconciliation'' between Mrs. Aquino and
Marcos. Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos to return from exile
in Hawaii, where he fled after a popular uprising toppled his
administration three years ago.
   Abadilla, former intelligence chief of the Manila area, was also
charged in the January 1987 coup attempt but was acquitted by a
military court in December.
   In another development, a relative of Mrs. Aquino charged
Wednesday that an American consulting firm was hired by Vice
President Salvador Laurel to undermine the government.
   But a spokesman for the company, Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly
of Alexandria, Va., said it was simply helping the opposition
organize a political party before the 1992 presidential election.
   During a speech to the House of Representatives, Rep. Emigdio
Tanjuatco, said the company ``monitored activity in Congress and in
the executive branch relevant to the Philippines'' as part of an
effort by Laurel to discredit the government.
   Laurel broke with Mrs. Aquino last year and announced he was
organizing an opposition movement.

<HEAD>Ex-President Gets Six-Year Jail Term for Trying to Replace Prime
Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORT VILA, Vanuatu (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ex-President George Sokomanu was
sentenced Tuesday to six years in jail after being convicted of
trying to install his nephew as prime minister of this South Pacific
island chain.
   Sokomanu, who has been president since 1980, was dismissed from
office in January for plotting against Prime Minister Walter Lini.
   Sokomanu's nephew, Barak Sope, and opposition leader Maxime
Carlot were given five-year prison sentences and former member of
Parliament Willie Jimmy was sentenced to two years. The charges
against Sokomanu, Sope and Carlot carried maximum sentences of life
imprisonment.
   Three defendants were acquitted.
   Sokomanu was convicted of inciting mutiny within Vanuatu's
paramilitary forces last December in an attempt to replace Lini's
elected government with an interim administration headed by Sope.
   Sokomanu and the other defendants were taken into police custody
just before Christmas.
   At the time of of his arrest Sokomanu acknowledged his action was
unconstitutional, but he said Lini was unable to govern after
suffering a stroke. He said he tried to install Sope as prime
minister to restore economic power.
   Sope and Lini had been engaged in a power struggle for more than
a year.
   Acquitted by British-born Judge Gordon Ward were former member of
Parliament John Naupa, Sokomanu's private secretary John Kalititi
and Frank Spooner.
   Those three and Jimmy had been charged with lesser counts of
conspiracy to overthrow the government and with administering and
making unlawful oaths and statements at a Dec. 18 swearing-in
ceremony.
   Ward was brought in from the Solomon Islands to hear the most
controversial case in Vanuatu's brief history and to pass judgment.
His decisions are subject to appeal.
   Sokomanu was removed from office in January by the Electoral
College which accused him of gross misconduct.
   Sokomanu had served as head of state and Lini as head of
government since Vanuatu became independent in July 1980.
   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, had been jointly
administered by Britain and France since 1906.
   It has a population of about 130,000 and is 1,395 miles northeast
of Sydney, Australia.

<HEAD>Turning `Blaxploitation' Upside Down</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1980, 50 stand-up comics tried their luck on
``Audition Night'' at New York's Improv. Two were Robert Townsend
and Keenan Ivory Wayans. They quickly became friends and ended up
co-writing ``Hollywood Shuffle,'' a film largely financed by
Townsend's credit cards that turned into one of last season's
surprise movie hits.
   Now Wayans is showcasing his own talents by writing, directing
and starring in ``I'm Gonna to Git You Sucka,'' a takeoff on the
``blaxploitation'' films of the 1970s.
   ``A few years ago, me and some friends were sitting around and
talking about the movies we used to go see,'' Wayans said in a
recent interview. ``The conversation went from, `remember this
movie' to `remember this scene.' We started laughing and that was
when `Airplane' was coming out and that was kind of a blueprint for
me.''
   Starting with the death of Junebug Spade from an overdose of gold
chains (``He was ready to die!'' the preacher boomed), ``I'm Gonna
to Git You Sucka'' takes on such movies as ``Superfly'' and
``Shaft'' and turns them upside down.
   Wayans, who also co-wrote and co-produced the Eddie Murphy
concert film, ``Raw,'' plays Jack Spade, who helps capture those
responsible for his brother Junebug's death. Assisting Spade are an
aging band of tough guys played by ex-football stars Jim Brown and
Bernie Casey and musician Isaac Hayes, who wrote the theme to
``Shaft.''
   ``That was the coolest thing,'' Wayans said. ``To be able to work
with those guys and then to watch them get up there and be totally
uninhibited. That's because they got it. They didn't take themselves
seriously. They were having a good time. In retrospect, they could
see where the humor was.''
   Fans of ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' will recognize John
Vernon, the dreaded Dean Wermer of Faber College. Vernon is the
villain again in ``I'm Going to Git You Sucka.'' He plays Mr. Big,
the man behind the proliferation of gold chains.
   ``My first choice was Shelly Winters,'' Wayans said. ``Initially,
it was still going to be `Mr.' Big but you wouldn't have ever seen
her face.''
   Wayans' project took a long time to get to the screen. When the
film was conceived in the early 1980s, he was a relatively unknown
stand-up comic and actor. It was a time when Hollywood studios were
not interested in financing an all black film. They were, however,
willing to reconsider if Wynans would agree to make a few ``minor''
changes.
   ``I went to Vestron and they kept coming up with the most bizarre
ways to integrate the cast they could think of. `How about if I get
Anthony Michael Hall (`The Breakfast Club,' `Sixteen Candles') to be
my younger brother _ a kid that was left on the doorstep of my house
and act black for the entire film?' ```And how about if we make one
of the guys like Charles Bronson.' They wanted so desperately to
integrate it they didn't care if they undermined the picture.''
   But the success of ``Hollywood Shuffle'' and Spike Lee's ``She's
Gotta Have It'' made the studios more receptive to Wayans' project
and he ended up getting United Artists to distribute the film.
   ``It was a lot easier to go in and sit down and really talk.
Before we did `Hollywood Shuffle,' if it was an all black act, no
one wanted to touch it.''
   Wayans grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan,
one of 10 children. He was trying to make people laugh as far back
as he could remember and had plenty of time to display his talents
at the family dinner table.
   ``There was always an audience and we were always competing,'' he
said. ``Dinner time was sitting at a long table with my parents at
each end. The objective was making the person across from you spit
food.''
   His early heros were Richard Pryor and the late Freddie Prinze,
who also grew up in Washington Heights. But while those comedians
had traumatic and tragic lives (Prinze committed suicide just as he
became a star), Wayans has no interest in being a ``tortured
artist,''
   ``It wasn't a psychological thing where I had a horrible family
life and I wanted the audience to love me,'' he said. ``There are
those who just find humor in almost anything, who have warped senses
of humor, which I'm a victim of. I just find everything funny and I
like being funny.''
   Although Mr. Big mutters ominously at the end of the movie that
``there will be no sequel,'' Wayans is anxious to continue making
films and also to help other blacks break into the business.
   ``The recognized pool of talent is so small that the opportunity
is tremendous,'' said Wayans, who found roles for Antonio Fargas,
Steve James and his brother Damon among others. ``There's a building
pool of talent right now.''
   But Wayans couldn't help adding, ``I used them all in the movie.''

   The Court of Appeals on Tuesday overturned
a murder conviction because sheriff's deputies were allowed to wear
rubber gloves in court to protect them in case the defendant was
infected with the AIDS virus.
   The opinion by Judge Charles E. Orth Jr. said it was likely the
sight of deputies sitting behind Bernard Wiggins wearing gloves led
jurors to believe he had AIDS and should be ``withdrawn from public
circulation and confined in an institution with others of his ilk.''
   ``The specter of the dread disease AIDS hovered over the trial,''
Orth said in the unanimous ruling by the seven-member court. ``The
trial judge refused to exorcise it'' despite ``Wiggins' persistent
and vehement protests.''
   The court returned the case to Prince George's County for a new
trial.
   Wiggins was convicted in November 1987 of the murder of Bjorn
Haug, whom he had met at a bar in his hometown of Washington. He is
in the Maryland Penitentiary in Baltimore.
   According to trial testimony, Haug returned to Wiggins'
apartment, where he was knocked unconscious and loaded into the
trunk of a car by Wiggins and three friends.
   The group drove into Prince George's County, where Haug, who had
regained consciousness, was killed by Wiggins, according to
testimony.
   Prosecutors told Judge Jacob Levin that Haug had been diagnosed
as having AIDS, that a codefendant and roommate of Wiggins carried
the AIDS virus and that Wiggins and his roommate were homosexual.
   Although Wiggins had not been tested for the virus, Levin said
there was ``a strong possibility or probability'' that he had it,
and denied a motion by defense attorneys that the guards not be
allowed to sit behind Wiggins while wearing gloves.
   The appeals court also ruled Tuesday that Levin should have
granted a defense motion not to admit items stolen from Haug's
apartment that were found in Wiggins' apartment because they were
not listed in a search warrant.

<TEXT>
   Tell Eric Robinson the date you were born
and he'll immediately give you the day of the week you first drew
breath. Same with dates in the future. He's a human calendar.
   Yet it's only weeks since the 19-year-old autistic savant
mastered buttoning his own clothes, allowing him to trade
elastic-waisted trousers for his first button-up Levis.
   Eric will graduate June 2 from a special education program that
has taught him the joy of work in an alien world. By the time he
earns his diploma, Eric hopes to have found a life's work in numbers.
   A recent issue of the Viewmont High School newspaper dubbed Eric
the school's ``Rain Man.'' He shares many traits with the movie's
title character, but there are important differences.
   Eric's calendar calculations and aptitude for figures don't make
him a prodigious savant like Raymond Babbitt, played by Dustin
Hoffman. But unlike Babbitt, Eric's mania for numbers and improving
social skills let him hold down a job. They loved him in trials at a
video store and the school library.
   Tests show Eric to be mildly retarded as well as autistic and a
savant, a mix that puts his promising quest for work in a post
office or city library on a very uncrowded plane.
   ``They are usually so incapacitated in other ways that their
skill won't help them,'' said Dr. Edward R. Ritvo of the UCLA School
of Medicine, one of the country's leading authorities on autism.
   Indeed, those who knew Eric when he was younger are surprised at
his blossoming sociability. Greetings in the corridors are returned
with a not-so-nervous ``Hi,'' and he has somewhat relaxed the
obsessive routines and rituals that govern an autistic life.
   ``I was worried because I had heard that they got worse as they
got into adolescence and families had to decide what to do with
them. With Eric just the opposite happened. He just seemed to
improve,'' said Candace Robinson, his mother.
   ``He's just a huge success story for parents with autistic kids
who normally feel isolated, frustrated and believe ... it's a burden
that will never let up,'' said Cindy Anderson, Eric's special
education teacher.
   Years ago, Anderson's first autistic student spoke only in the
second-person and was prone to unpredictable rages that injured
herself and others. Eric, her third autistic pupil, is the first
savant and the only one to shine at the community vocational
opportunities Anderson arranges.
   ``I think he's trying to understand people's feelings,'' she
said. ``It's a very rote process, a very mechanical process.''
   Autism, absorption in self-centered, subjective mental activity,
is a severe disorder present in four of 10,000 births, an
overwhelming majority of them males. Its cause is unknown, but
evidence suggests chemical or structural abnormalities in the brain.
Among its characteristics is a profound disability in forming normal
human attachments, or in showing or receiving affection.
   Eric stiffens up when hugged, even by his parents, and won't let
on if he's sick or in pain.
   A study by Ritvo and others published in February's American
Journal of Psychiatry shows about two-thirds of those with autism
have some degree of mental retardation, scoring below 70 on
standardized IQ tests.
   Only about 10 percent of autistic people fall into the savant
category, and far fewer of those are mentally retarded, other
studies show.
   Mrs. Robinson believes her son, who hoards bus schedules and
loves to read the phone books he gets at Christmas, performs his
calendar gymnastics by visual rather than mathematical means.
   ``I used to wonder if he was calculating dates, but I really
believe it's a matter of having a photograph in his mind of our
100-year calendar. I asked him dates in the 1800s the other day and
he couldn't do it,'' she said.
   That's Eric's explanation, too, elicited in what is typically a
one-sided conversation with a stranger. He nervously checks his
watch every few seconds.
   How do you figure out what day somebody was born? ``I have a good
memory.''
   What do you want to do after graduation? ``Have a job.''
   Something with numbers? ``Yes.''
   He's a whiz at simple math and his memory for numbers is as
convenient as it is vast. ``He makes a great phone directory,'' says
brother Dan.
   ``I think about anything he sees he's likely to remember,'' said
Mrs. Robinson, who spent hours a few years ago making flash cards of
multiplication tables, only to have Eric render them useless by
memorizing the answers the first time through.
   Peggy Graham, manager of Video USA in this Salt Lake City suburb,
accepted Eric for an hour a day's training on a two-week trial
basis. He stayed for 1{ years, quickly memorizing the shelf code for
every videocassette in the store and eventually mastering the
computer to check in movies.
   ``He was amazing with numbers,'' Graham said. But it took him six
months to routinely talk to other employees and much longer to pass
time with customers. ``I used to stand by the door and say, `Eric,
you can't leave until you say goodbye to everybody.' He would
finally mumble goodbye.''
   ``The emotional connection is the last to be made by an autistic
child,'' Anderson said. ``It's so difficult to make people
understand the excitement you feel when they finally start making
that connection.''
   An earlier stint shelving books at the school library gave Eric
command of the Dewey Decimal System and friendship with the
once-skeptical librarian. He was far less avid about custodial and
landscaping jobs, and Anderson believes absence of social
interaction as much as numbers accounts for that today.
   ``He reaches out to people. His social habits are much more
appropriate,'' she said, citing Eric's response to the death of a
school administrator's wife. As expected, Eric affably recapitulated
for the bereaved husband the obituary information from the newspaper.
   But then he added, ``I'm so sorry about your wife.''

<HEAD>Cat Stevens Endorses Rushdie Death Sentence Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former pop singer Cat Stevens reiterated his
support for the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence against
Salman Rushdie, saying the author's treatment of Islam was ``as good
as stabbing Moslems in the heart.''
   Stevens, who changed his name to Yusuf Islam when he became a
Moslem in 1979, said Tuesday that threatening to kill Rushdie was
the equivalent of the United States using an atomic bomb.
   ``It's got to be seen as a deterrent, so that other people should
not commit the same mistake again,'' Stevens said in an interview
with the television show ``World Monitor,'' produced by The
Christian Science Monitor.
   Last week, Stevens denied endorsing the death sentence after his
statements received harsh criticism in Great Britain. Rushdie's
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has generated worldwide outrage among
Moslems and support for the Moslem author in the West.
   In Tuesday's interview, Stevens also said negative reaction in
the United States to his comments is a bit ironic, considering his
former record company recently refused his request to stop producing
his records.
   ``All I can see is that God works in mysterious ways,'' said
Stevens, who was interviewed from a mosque near London, where he
lives. ``Some of my records are being destroyed.''
   Several radio stations have refused to play Stevens' records
because of his earlier remarks. A New York station offered copies of
``The Satanic Verses'' to people who brought their Stevens' records
to the station.
   Stevens, who said the novel's treatment of Islam was ``as good as
stabbing Moslems in the heart,'' suggested that Rushdie should
repent writing the book. ``If he manages to escape (the death
sentence) he still has to face God on the day of judgment,'' he
said. ``So I would recommend to him to sincerely change his ways
right now.''

   Shellie Austin begs for money in the subway, gets
valium from a friend and sometimes spends the night with other
teen-agers on a littered sidewalk by the River Thames.
   At 17, she is one of London's army of homeless youths whose
numbers, critics of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher claim, are
being swollen by the Conservative government's radical shakeup of
the welfare system.
   The government is determined to wean Britons off what it calls
``the dependency culture.'' To do this, it is paying 16- and
17-year-old high school dropouts $50-$60 a week to become job
trainees and cutting off welfare payments to those who don't sign up.
   More than 400,000 now work for their benefits each year and gain
job experience in the process. But those who don't register for a
one- or two-year ``YTS,'' or Youth Training Scheme, have been barred
since Sept. 12 from ``signing on'' for $33 a week in state aid.
   Exemptions are available to youths who suffer ``severe hardship''
such as disability or a violent home, and of 4,500 applications for
hardship status, nearly 3,000 have been accepted.
   But critics, including some members of Mrs. Thatcher's own
Conservative Party, have forced an acknowledgment from Social
Security Minister Nicholas Scott that the reform is causing
problems, and he has hinted he will broaden his discretionary powers
to help those worst hit.
   Conservative lawmaker Robin Squire supports this Thatcherite
concept of ``workfare,'' but opposes cutting welfare payments.
   ``People who have no real home should be properly looked after
until they are able to get a job or a YTS course,'' he says.
   Their only alternatives are to ``either resort to crime or to
begging gifts or to prostitution,'' he said in an interview.
   Some see the issue as a test of how far Mrs. Thatcher's crusade
can go in revamping the 43-year-old welfare system.
   Tony Morgan, who runs the New Horizon day hostel near Covent
Garden in the heart of London, said young homeless often regard job
training as ``slave labor. They don't think they should be forced to
do it.''
   Many come from unemployment-stricken northern England, or are
fleeing broken homes, and cannot afford accommodation. The YTS has
135,000 unfilled places, yet some youngsters have difficulty finding
the right slot, and others get fired because they don't get on with
their employers.
   ``There's no transition,'' Morgan said. ``Either it works or it
doesn't work ... Any other way you can think of to make money, they
do it. Most cope very well. Of course, some go under.''
   Austin, stepping out of the rain to meet friends in the hostel's
dingy pool room, said she left home in September because ``me and me
dad didn't get on.''
   She say she has since slept in doorways, under railroad bridges
and on sidewalks in the so-called ``cardboard city'' along the
Thames. Lately, she has found shelter in an abandoned house in
Camden, north London.
   She says she gave up a trainee mechanic job after four days
because ``it was too underpaid and it wasn't worth it.'' She says
she can earn up to $50 a day begging in subway stations.
   ``I'm better off how I am now than I was when I was living at
home,'' Austin said, her voice wavering. ``There ain't no one
telling me what I should do.'' Her eyes are unsteady; her face
flashes a smile, then becomes a grimace.
   ``People who are homeless now are all like brother and sister,''
she said. ``All they're worried about is when is their next money
going to come to buy food, if they've got enough blankets, if it's
going to rain tonight.''
   Drugs and violence are endemic. Illnesses such as scurvy, scabies
and tuberculosis are common. The government says London has 23,000
homeless, but welfare groups say the total is closer to 40,000 and
growing.
   Last year, the government ended housing subsidies for nearly 1
million poor. Grants for buying stoves and beds were changed to
interest-free loans. Unemployed people under age 25 now are allowed
only two to six weeks welfare if they remain in the same region.
   The government allocated $36 million last summer to help London
authorities renovate empty public housing and pay for homeless
hostels. New Horizon still must raise $128,000 in voluntary aid this
year.
   ``We're professional beggars,'' jokes Morgan.
   Sam Hughes, 17, from Manchester, said he was forced off the dole
into becoming a trainee decorator, but his job consisted mainly of
running errands. He quit in frustration.
   ``You try to sleep in toilets or park benches,'' he said.
``There's nowhere warm. You're shaking all night and all the next
day you're shaking. Your stomach's empty. You feel dead weak.''
   He now earns $182 a week working in a grocery store, and is
moving into a working men's club where the weekly rent is $107.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher did me good really _ she made me find work,''
said Hughes, a gaunt figure with spiked hair.
   ``People who've got something in them, they're going to benefit
out of this,'' he said. ``But for every one person that does get a
job, 10 people will go homeless and go on the streets.''

<HEAD>Israeli Chef Says Soviets Approve Kosher Eatery</HEAD>

   An Israeli chef says Soviet authorities have
given him approval to set up a kosher restaurant in Moscow.
   Shalom Kadosh said Tuesday that he discussed the idea last week
in Moscow with city officials and tourism and trade representatives.
   ``The Soviets are showing a great readiness to help us create the
restaurant as quickly as possible,'' he said on Israel Television,
though they have imposed ``some limitations on the signs'' of the
future restaurant.
   The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said the eatery will be funded
by American Jewish activists and its prices will be subsidized.
   Kadosh, chef at Jerusalem's Sheraton-Plaza Hotel, said the menu
would be based on Israeli cuisine and that some products would be
imported from Israel. He said the kosher certificate will be given
by the chief rabbi of Moscow.
   Kadosh said he plans to travel to Moscow in the near future to
help organize the restaurant and will supervise it through short
visits.
   ``The aim is not making profit but creating a kosher food place
for Jews and tourists,'' Kadosh said. ``My best profit would be a
contribution to the Soviet-Israeli ties.''
   The Soviet Union cut ties with the Jewish state following the
1967 Middle East war. In recent years, the two countries have
exchanged consular missions.
   Last month, the first Jewish community center in the Soviet Union
in 50 years opened in Moscow.

   A Dominican nun who painted peace slogans
on the runway of a U.S. Air Force base was ordered to sit through a
court session as punishment for refusing to pay a fine.
   Sister Mair-Colette Ludden was fined $232 Tuesday by magistrates
in this town 40 miles northeast of London who convicted her of
criminal damage at Alconbury base. She said she would not pay
because the money would go toward a system which supports nuclear
weapons.
   Under an obscure regulation, court chairman Dolph Claydon ordered
the nun to stay within the court precincts for the rest of the day.
   The sister said later: ``It was a great relief when they let me
stay in the court. I was told later it was equivalent to spending a
day in the cells.''

   Five thousand police officers lined bitterly cold
streets outside a Brooklyn church Tuesday for the funeral of the
first New York police officer killed on duty in the city this year.
   Officer Robert E. Machate was shot to death March 3 while
struggling with a suspect in Brooklyn. Two men, both illegal aliens,
were arrested shortly afterwards.
   At the funeral Mass, Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward expressed hope the state Legislature would override
Gov. Mario Cuomo's promised veto of bill to reinstate the death
penalty.
   ``What's required here is that every criminal in the street know
that you're gonna be apprehended, that you're gonna be prosecuted,
that you're gonna be jailed and where appropriate, executed,'' a
visibly angry Koch told mourners packing St. Mark's Roman Catholic
Church.
   The state Assembly in Albany passed a death penalty bill Monday,
and Cuomo promised to veto it.
   Outside St. Mark's, the police officers, most from metropolitan
area forces, formed a four-block long blue line.
   As Machate's coffin was carried out of the church by an honor
guard, three police helicopters in a ``missing man'' formation
swooped over the church.
   Officer Steven McDonald, who was paralyzed when he was shot while
on duty, attended the services in his wheelchair.
   Machate, was was 25, had been baptized and married in the same
church. His wife, Grace Ann, seven months pregnant with the couple's
only child, wore a miniature version of her husband's shield around
her neck during the service.
   Machate had earned 13 awards since joining the force in 1986.
   ``Robert Machate was intensely proud to be a police officer,''
said the Rev. Gerard J. Arella, noting that the slain officer came
from a police family. ``He and his family were all proud to be
servants of the people.''

   A Chinese fishing vessel caught fire in heavy
seas off the south China coast, and at least five crewmen died and
31 were missing, an official report said today.
   One survivor was picked up by a passing oil tanker two hours
after abandoning the ship, which caught fire Saturday about 44 miles
southeast of the coastal city of Xiamen in Fujian province, the
China News Service reported.
   According to an account from the survivor, Cai Fuyin, a fire
broke out at the back of Minxia Yu 0173 and within 20 minutes spread
to the bridge, forcing the 37-member crew to abandon ship, the
agency said.
   Chinese authorities the following day sent eight fishing vessels
and two navy craft to search for survivors, but by Monday evening
had found only five bodies, the report said.

   Two crew members were killed and one was reported

off the western coast, local police said.
   Six others aboard the 1,000-ton Shoryu-maru were rescued by
helicopter while skipper Sadao Arata swam to safety, said police
official Hideo Miyajima.
   The vessel went down in Toyama Bay, 160 miles west of Tokyo,
Miyajima said by telephone from nearby Toyama-kia.
   He said the tanker was anchored slightly under a mile off shore
when it was rocked by high waves and then smashed into a breakwater
early Wednesday.
   The ship was to have loaded gasoline in the same port today
before leaving for Mikuni, another western port along the Sea of
Japan, Miyajima said.

   As national elections move closer,
the biggest bloc of voters remains undecided, despite months of
feverish campaigning by the main presidential contenders.
   Analysts say the undecided voters are mainly supporters of
President Raul Alfonsin's Radical Civil Union angry at five years of
economic stagnation and social unrest; Peronists unhappy with their
party's candidate, the center-right Carlos Menem; and center-left
voters who feel none of the candidates speak for them.
   ``I don't feel represented by any of them,'' said Virginia
Dardalla Rute, 33, the owner of a small public relations company.
``None of them will make a good president.''
   Real estate agent Sandra Reymann, 25, voted for Alfonsin in 1983
but has been disappointed and would rather not vote for a Radical in
these elections, set for May 14. But at the same time, she would
never vote Peronist or socialist and doesn't think a conservative
could win.
   ``I'm not uninformed,'' Miss Reymann said. ``I read the papers. I
listen to the radio.'' But no candidate stands out, she said, and
the ballot she casts _ voting is mandatory in Argentina _ may be
blank.
   At state in the elections are the presidency, some Senate seats,
half the House of Deputies, and provincial legislatures.
   Three surveys conducted over the past two months have put
undecided voters at 39 percent, 32 percent and 32.5 percent.
   Menem is 7 to 10 points ahead of the Radicals' Eduardo Angeloz in
those polls and others, but the gap has narrowed considerably.
Alvaro Alsogaray of the rightist Democratic Center Union trails a
distant third, followed by Nestor Vicente of the United Left.
   Under the constitution, Alfonsin cannot seek a second consecutive
term.
   Menem and Angeloz, both provincial governors and lawyers, have
traversed the country and made the requisite swing through Europe to
demonstrate their statesmenship abilities.
   Positions have been staked out on how to restart the economy,
balance the budget, curtail urban crime, provide housing, pay the
foreign debt, and ease relations between the military and human
rights groups.
   Menem, 53, and Angeloz, 57, are both center-right, but their
parties are movements that defy political labeling. Their parties,
along with the armed forces, have provided Argentina's presidents
for most of this century.
   Menem has tried to play down the Peronists' ``black legend'' of
violence and administrative incompetence, which preceded military
coups in 1955 and 1976. The latter has tried to distance himself
from an unpopular government without losing the support of Alfonsin,
a veteran campaigner, and resources like access to state media.
   Now and again, the two snipe at one another. Angelos says Menem's
proposals are ``simplistic.'' Menem says Angelos represents a
government ``that fulfilled only 5 percent of what it promised.''
   But each for the moment seems more interested in polishing his
own public image _ Menem as the charismatic champion of organized
labor and the downtrodden, and Angeloz as the honest administrator
and family man _ than in demolishing the other.
   ``I won't let you down'' is the slogan on Menem posters, which
show the candidate with his hair to his shoulders and sideburns
covering most of his cheeks.
   ``It can be done!'' is Angeloz's slogan. He usually appears on
posters and in person in a blue blazer and open-necked shirt,
wearing thick-framed black glasses and a broad smile.
   Vicente, a lawyer and several times a losing candidate for the
House of Deputies, lacks a nationwide constituency and is little
known outside the capital. What he really is aiming to do is
increase the number of leftist legislators in Congress.
   Alsogaray, for the same reasons, has little chance of winning.
But the 75-year-old military engineer and former economy minister
and ambassador to the United States is a potential kingmaker.
   In a scenario that frustrates Menem and makes Angeloz credible
despite any poll, no candidate will win enough votes to guarantee
victory in the Electoral College, and the 600 electors pick a
president, or failing to do that, pass the decision onto Congress.
   In either case, the conservative Alsogaray may trade his electors
for political concessions, and his party has much more in common
with the Radicals than the Peronists.
   In 1983, Alsogaray supported Alfonsin, reluctantly, to prevent a
Peronist victory.
   Angeloz and Alsogaray insist their electors will vote for them.
More importantly, both have rejected Peronist suggestions that the
runners-up support the candidate who gets the most votes.
   Maria Julia Alsogaray, a national deputy and key adviser to her
father, in an interview published in the Buenos Aires Herald
acknowledged that in the end, either in the Electoral College or
Congress, her party might provide the winning margin.
   She set no specific concessions the party would demand but
insisted that ``any candidate wishing to get our votes would have to
adhere'' to the party's platform, which calls for the privatization
of state industries and minimal government, among other things.

<TEXT>
   Tibetans and Chinese this week commemorate
different sides of a bloody 1959 Tibetan rebellion against Chinese
Communist rule.
   For Tibetans, Friday marks 30 years since they repudiated Chinese
rule and surged into the streets to shield their spiritual leader,
the Dalai Lama, from an alleged kidnapping plot. Hundreds and
perhaps thousands died when China put down the revolt.
   For the Chinese, it marks the start of three decades of socialist
``democratic reform'' in the remote Himalayan region.
   Even before the anniversary date this week, more blood was shed
when Tibetans shouting ``Free Tibet!'' clashed with police. At least
a dozen people were killed when Tibetans marched behind their banned
pre-communist flag and then attacked Chinese-owned businesses and
government buildings. There is fear of more violence on Friday.
   Exactly what happened on March 10, 1959, and in the following
weeks remains a subject of great controversy and there are few
non-partisan accounts. A new generation of Tibetans said they don't
know who to believe.
   ``Each side abuses the other,'' said a young Tibetan woman in
Beijing. ``If you read what is written by the exile (Tibetan)
government in India, then the Chinese were invaders and the Tibetans
were right to fight them.
   ``But if you read what China says, you think, `They are right,
the Tibetans were wrong,''' she said. ``I can only judge the things
I see now.''
   But she and others of her generation expressed bitterness over
the legacy of the 1959 rebellion: Tibet has become an armed camp,
and hatred runs deep between the native people and dominant Han
Chinese.
   China claims its sovereignty over Tibet dates to the 13th
century, when the Mongols who ruled China sent an army into Tibet.
   But until China's Red Army marched into Tibet in 1950, there were
long periods of virtually no contact between the two. Actual power
lay with Buddhist monks under the leadership of the Dalai Lama,
revered as the reincarnation of Tibet's protector god.
   Eastern Tibetan clans began armed revolt against the communists
in 1956, but Lhasa remained calm until 1959. Violence was touched
off when the local Chinese general invited the Dalai Lama to attend
a theatrical show.
   A rumor spread that the army planned to kidnap the Dalai Lama to
force him to attend a legislative session in Beijing.
   On the day of the show _ March 10 _ tens of thousands Tibetans
surged around the Dalai Lama's palace to prevent him from attending.
Some attacked Chinese targets.
   Secular Tibetan leaders seized the moment to declare
independence, and monasteries seconded the call.
   A long standoff began, with the Dalai Lama inside his palace
urging both sides to stay calm. Finally on March 17, the Chinese
allegedly fired two mortar shells into the palace grounds. The Dalai
Lama and his family fled that night, eventually reaching India.
   Unaware of this, the crowd stood guard around the palace until
March 20, when the Chinese army began steady shelling. After three
days, the last resistance in Lhasa was quelled.
   Rebel attacks on Chinese forces in remote areas continued for
years, but to little effect. The Chinese blamed the revolt on the
disgrunted former ruling class and moved to weaken it by dividing up
the land and forming communes after the pattern set elsewhere in
China.
   They also began a campaign to suppress Tibet's traditional
Buddhist culture, peaking in the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural
Revolution when thousands of monasteries were destroyed and monks
were jailed or forced into labor.
   The small communities of monks and nuns that have grown again in
the past decade seem radicalized by the experience. They have held
pro-independence protests repeatedly in the past 18 months. Four
violent clashes with police, including this week's, have left dozens
dead and hundreds injured.
   The Chinese show no sign of yielding their hold on the region.
   Ren Yinong of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission said the
government is in constant contact with the exiled Dalai Lama, mainly
through the Chinese Embassy in India. But he said the two sides are
unable to agree on terms for starting talks.
   ``Except for independence, anything can be discussed,'' the
official People's Daily newspaper said last week. ``As for Tibetan
autonomy, the Chinese government absolutely cannot make any
concessions.''
   The Dalai Lama has said he is willing to accept less than full
independence and that his priority is to improve living conditions
for his people. Speedy agreement is needed if Tibetan culture is to
be preserved, he said last year.
   A recent broadcast by the official Lhasa Radio was not optimistic.
   The struggle against separatists, it said, is an ``arduous and
complex affair,'' and all involved ``must be mentally prepared for a
long-term struggle.''

   Seventy-nine percent of Soviet women and 43
percent of U.S. women think alcoholism is a chief cause of divorce,
a poll shows.
   Poor communication wrecks most marriages, 77 of the American
women said in the survey. They ranked alcoholism second, while 39
percent of Soviet women ranked parental interference second.
   The survey, based on an unscientific sampling, was conducted by
Woman's Day, a U.S. magazine geared toward suburban women, and
Krestyanka, a Soviet magazine whose name translates as, ``Peasant
Woman,'' although 54 percent of its respondents identified
themselves as white-collar.
   ``This survey reveals there's nothing foreign about domestic
difficulties,'' said Ellen R. Levine, Woman's Day editor in chief.
   ``Soviet and American women have more in common than they may
have thought: too much work, troubled marriages, husbands who won't
help, and alcoholism.''
   ``Stress is the great equalizer,'' said Ethel Klein, associate
professor of political science at Columbia University, who
interpreted the poll for Woman's Day. ``Women have hit a strong
stress point in both societies.''
   Fifty-six percent of the Soviet women surveyed said an ideal
husband should be faithful and a good head of the family. More than
63 percent of American women mentioned ``communicative,''
``emotionally supportive'' and ``faithful'' as the virtues of the
ideal husband.
   Only 2 percent of American women thought good homemaking skills
make an ideal husband. Still, 61 percent said American men must
assume more responsibility for housework and 50 percent wanted men
to help more with child care. Twenty percent of the Soviet women
said men should do more at home and 13 percent said men should spend
more time raising their kids.
   The surveys were conducted by mail so that rural Soviet women
without phones could be included. Women's Day received about 30,000
responses from women with a median age of 41; more than
three-quarters are married and almost 90 percent have children.
Krestyanka got back about 200,000 responses, with a median age of
30, three-fourths married and 78 percent with children.
   The Yankelovich Clancy Shulman polling firm tabulated the Woman's
Day results.

   The city's unmarked police cars are so well
known that a drug raid turned up a computerized list of them,
prompting police to request $75,000 for new cars.
   City Council's finance committee was considering the request. The
new vehicles would allow the department to sell or replace
undercover cars every six months, Police Chief Fay E. Peek III said.
   Drug dealers' familiarity with the unmarked cars not only hampers
undercover work but may endanger officers' lives, police said. The

   A federal jury Tuesday convicted a former aide
to U.S. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of accepting $1,300 in illegal
payments from two Polish immigrants who had sought the senator's
help.
   Ladd J. Anthony, 47, of Cleveland sat impassively, with one elbow
on the defense table, when the verdict was read in U.S. District
Court.
   Anthony said, ``No comment,'' to reporters as he left the
courtroom.
   His attorney, Elmer A. Giuliani, said it was too early to say
whether there would be an appeal.
   In a statement distributed in the federal courthouse after the
verdict was read, Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the decision was ``the
end to a sad episode that began in November 1986,'' when he asked
the Justice Department to investigate allegations that Anthony had
been acting improperly with his constituents.
   It is illegal for federal employees to accept money or any thing
of value in return for performing their official duties.
   ``Those who are sworn to uphold the law should expect no leniency
when they break the law,'' Metzenbaum said.
   No date was set for sentencing.
   Anthony was convicted of accepting $300 from Irena Boc, who
testified last week that she gave Anthony the money in an envelope
in 1983 to help her with an application for U.S. citizenship.
   Waclaw Pietrzykowski testified that Anthony solicited $2,300 from
him in 1985 to help the daughter of his landlady, Anni Wojcieszko,
with her application to the Ohio State University College of
Veterinary Medicine. Pietrzykowski and Wojcieszko testified they
gave Anthony $1,000 and that he later returned $500.
   The trial began March 1.
   In closing arguments, Giuliani tried to shift blame for the
alleged payoffs to others and to point up discrepancies in testimony.
   But prosecutors blamed the discrepancies on time lapses and the
difficulty Polish witnesses had with the English language.
   ``The truth is Ladd Anthony is the one ripping off these
people,'' said Jackie M. Bennett Jr., a lawyer with the Justice
Department's Public Integrity Section.
   ``Ladd Anthony is the one who took advantage of some of the most
vulnerable people in our society,'' Bennett said.

   Attention, dieters. The musical recipe for a
wickedly delicious chocolate cake by Julia Child is being cooked up
at the Kennedy Center tonight. It takes about 20 minutes to devour,
and it doesn't contain a single calorie.
   But composer Lee Hoiby warns that his ``Bon Appetit!'' a new
musical monologue performed by actress Jean Stapleton with Hoiby at
the piano, may tempt chocolate lovers to break their vows of
abstinence.
   ``I am tempted not only by the lyrics but by the cake itself,''
confesses Hoiby, who is trying to observe a diet of such macrobiotic
foods as cabbage, brown rice and fish with seaweed.
   ``I often give in to temptation and say I'll make up for it
later,'' he said during a prerehearsal interview. ``I love chocolate
cake. The things that are out of reach are what we love in this
world.''
   Hoiby's piece is based on the videotape of a 1961 television
cooking lesson by Julia Child, and will be served as the dessert
course for an evening of Hoiby's music at the Terrace Theater.
   After its world premiere here, Hoiby and Miss Stapleton will
perform the work at Long Beach, Calif., on March 31 and at Santa Fe,
N.M., on April 9.
   On stage, Miss Stapleton sings and pantomimes her way around an
imaginary kitchen, using lyrics taken from Miss Child's tape, as she
prepares a ``very special, ve-e-ery choc'late-ly, bittersweet,
loooovely cake'' called Le Gateau au Chocolat, l`Eminence Brune.
   ``What I love is her wonderful sense of theater,'' the actress
says. ``She's not just a cook. She's a character, very rich and very
humorous.''
   Miss Stapleton makes the most of the TV chef's comic touches,
tapping an invisible cake pan and instructing her audience to
``knock out the flour on the floor, if you have a self-cleaning
kitchen like mine.''
   And she engages in a fast-paced musical race with an electric
mixer, as she beats egg whites in an unlined copper bowl. ``We're
going to see who wins,'' she sings, ``and I think maybe I'll win ...
because I'm bigger.''
   Hoiby says ``Bon Appetit!'' _ which takes its title from Miss
Child's familiar closing line _ was composed as a concert
curtain-raiser for a longer work he wrote in 1984, his operatic
version of the late Ruth Draper's monologue, ``The Italian Lesson.''
   Hoiby and associate Mark Shulgasser came up with the idea of
using the script of a Julia Child cooking lesson as a vehicle for
Miss Stapleton, a veteran of Broadway musicals who is better known
as Archie Bunker's wife, Edith, on the ``All in the Family'' TV
series.
   Miss Stapleton wrote Miss Child for permission. Miss Child
happily agreed, and sent a batch of her tapes for viewing. Hoiby,
who watched them for four full days, became intrigued by the chef's
``rhapsodic phrases'' and musical metaphors.
   ``Her speaking patterns really grab you, the phraseology, the
unexpected little interjections,'' he said. ``There is a kind of
musical cadence in her speech which one isn't aware of unless one
starts to set it to music, and then there it is.''
   Is there something musical, too, about chocolate cake?
   ``Well, you see, chocolate cake, it's a very special moment,''
Hoiby replied. ``It's an indulgence, something you don't want to do
too much of. It's like a reward _ you ate all your spinach, now you
can have your reward. It's put in a very special category as a
treat.''
   Getting hungry?
   After tonight's concert, members of the audience will gather at a
reception to nibble on the real thing, Le Gateau au Chocolat,
l'Eminence Brune, prepared from Miss Child's recipe by the Kennedy
Center chef.
   ``The cake is going to be the icing,'' says Shulgasser.

   The boyfriend of a mother of three cannot
spend the night while the children are home, the state's highest
court has ruled.
   The state Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld a lower court decision
to bar the boyfriend, Joseph DiPippo, from staying overnight, saying
the ruling raised no major constitutional issues.
   Civil libertarians expressed surprise at the decision and found
the remark that the case raised no constitutional questions
disturbing.
   ``I think that the state of Rhode Island has made a very poor
statemeent about women, divorced women, single parents and their
children, and their collective rights to privacy in their own
homes,'' said Patricia A. Hurst, an American Civil Liberties Union
attorney for Carla J. Parrillo.
   Ms. Parrillo and her husband, Justin Jr., were divorced in May
1986, and Ms. Parrillo was given custody of her children, two
daughters and a son, ages 8 13 at the time. Parrillo was given
visitation rights.
   In June, the Parrillos returned to Family Court, and Ms. Parrillo
wanted her ex-husband to see the children in a location away from
her home. Parrillo wanted his ex-wife restrained from having any
``unrelated males'' stay overnight at her house.
   Ms. Parrillo contended that her ex-husband began to harass her
upon learning that she was dating DiPippo.
   DiPippo stayed overnight once or twice a week, Ms. Parrillo said,
and it caused no harm to her children, who were in separate
bedrooms. She told the court that her children liked DiPippo, but
she had no plans to marry him in the near future.
   Parrillo began reducing his support payments when he learned
DiPippo was visiting, the high court said.
   The children told the lower court's judge in a private meeting
that they all got along well with DiPippo, although the son said
there were times he disliked the man.
   But the judge ruled the overnight visits ``in the presence of the
children, were not conducive to their general well-being, at least
in terms of their psychological welfare,'' the high court said.
   The judge also had noted that if Ms. Parrillo married DiPippo,
the issue would become moot.
   Ms. Parrillo appealed, saying the judge erred because no evidence
existed that her sleeping with DiPippo psychologically harmed her
children.
   But the high court upheld the Family Court decision, saying that
ruling ``was without question directed at Joseph. ... Joseph may
still visit the marital domicile overnight, with the exception of
those times when the children are with their mother.''
   Hurst said she hoped Ms. Parrillo would appeal the decision.
   ``The practical effect on Carla Parrillo is that she is precluded
from conducting her private activities in the privacy of her own
home at her discretion,'' she said.

<HEAD>Navy Recruit's Death Blamed on Safety Neglect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of a 19-year-old Navy recruit during
training a year ago resulted from the service's neglect for safety
procedures and pressure on the training system from higher-ups,
according to a congressional investigation.
   In a report released Tuesday, the General Accounting Office said
Lee Mirecki of Appleton, Wis., died at the Navy's Pensacola, Fla.,
Rescue Swimmer School in part because of ``an intimidating,
non-volunteer atmosphere and inadequate controls at the school and
its superior commands.''
   Some of the flaws remain uncorrected, the GAO said. And it found
that of 16 other Navy training deaths between Jan. 1, 1986, and the
end of last year, safety problems contributed to five of the
fatalities.
   ``The bottom line is that Navy instructors still are not trained
to conduct high-risk training and that students still are not
screened to make sure they can handle the dangers,'' said Rep. Toby
Roth, R-Wis., who requested the investigation along with the other
members of the state's congressional delegation.
   Roth called Mirecki's death ``a tragedy waiting to happen,''
pointing to GAO findings that he was unqualified for the swimming
rescue course, had untrained and unsupervised instructors and was
prevented from dropping out because of pressure on the school to
increase the number of graduates it turned out.
   ``This GAO report is a catalog of failures by the Navy, which led
to Lee Mirecki's death and others,'' Roth said at a news conference.
He vowed to follow up to see that remaining problems are resolved
and asked Vice Admiral John Disher, head of the service's training
system, to contact families of recruits who died in training ``to
tell them what really happened.''
   The GAO said it had discussed its findings with the Navy and
reported that officials ``generally agreed'' and ``were receptive to
suggestions on how to improve training safety'' and accident
investigations.
   Mirecki panicked during a swimming-pool drill known as ``sharks
and daisies,'' in which swimmers must free themselves from an
instructor who grabs them from behind, simulating a drowning person.
After counseling and medical examination, he was found ``not
physically qualified'' for the course because of a phobia of being
held under water.
   But despite the findings, he was re-enrolled in the class and
forced to undergo the drill again. GAO said Mirecki left the pool
and clutched an equipment rack, shouting such things as ``I quit''
and ``Please don't put me back in the water,'' but was dragged back
to the pool by instructors. After a struggle in the pool, he was
removed unconscious and could not be revived.
   An autopsy found that Mirecki probably died of heartbeat
irregularity caused by extreme fear, fatigue and decreased oxygen.
The lead instructor was found guilty by a general court martial of
negligent homicide and sentenced to a demotion and 90 days'
confinement. Eight others associated with the class were given
various administrative punishments, including demotions and
reprimands.
   Some improvements have been made, GAO said. The ``sharks and
daisies'' drill has been dropped, instructors are given better
training and safety equipment is kept on hand at the swimming pool.
There also is a clearer policy regarding students' rights to drop
out of a course, the investigators said.
   But the GAO said there remains great pressure on students not to
drop out of a course because it is made clear to them that doing so
will adversely affect their careers, and that there still is no
system to alert instructors to students with a history of problems.

<HEAD>Soviet Media, in Switch, Report on Raisa Gorbachev's Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass did not go into loving detail on what Raisa
Gorbachev wore or who did her hair, but it did report on what the
first lady was thinking about some world and domestic issues _ an
unusual turn for Soviet media.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, wife of the president and Communist Party chief,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, spoke at a a reception she gave Monday in
honor of International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday that is being
celebrated today.
   She talked about her husband's reform policies and about how the
world's women have improved prospects for peace, and Tass, the
official Soviet news agency, reported her views.
   State-run television frequently shows the stylish Russian first
lady and Western journalists interview her. But it is rare for
fellow Soviets to be let in on her thoughts.
   ``If people currently are more confident of a peaceful future, we
know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all
continents for friendship, cooperation and profound mutual
understanding of nations,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said at the reception, as
reported by Tass.
   For Tass to be covering the reception itself _ for wives of
ambassadors and other diplomats in Moscow, wives of members of the
ruling Communist Party Politburo and Soviet women in various fields
_ was unusual.
   Before Gorbachev came to power four years ago, Kremlin wives
almost invariably were kept backstage.
   Mrs. Gorbachev changed that. The attractive, 57-year-old former
teacher of Marxist-Leninist philosophy has taken a role somewhat
resembling that of the wife of a U.S. president.
   Not all Soviets are delighted with the change.
   Many are taken aback by her wardrobe, large and glamorous by
Soviet standards. Others grumble that she is too involved in her
husband's work.
   On Monday, Mrs. Gorbachev gave the grumblers some ammunition by
going public with some of her views.
   Speaking of her husband's reforms, she said, ``Soviet people are
putting into practice plans of revolutionary restructuring. We are
connecting to it the destiny of our country, of our nation. We want
our public life in all aspects _ socio-economic, political, moral,
ecological, and in the sphere of human rights and freedoms _ to be
worthy of a human being.
   ``By transforming and renewing our society on a socialist basis,
on the principles of humanism and democracy, we are making our
country more open for all the nations of the world.'
   She greeted her guests individually and gave each a bouquet,
reported Rebecca Matlock, wife of U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock.
   ``She's a very attractive, intelligent and vocal woman. If they
let her speak more often, everyone would benefit,'' Mrs. Matlock
told The Associated Press.
   The Gorbachevs later attended a televised celebration held in the
Bolshoi Theater in Moscow to mark International Women's Day.
   This time, things were a little more typical.
   Gorbachev sat on the dais with other Politburo members and
dignitaries.
   His wife was in the audience.

<HEAD>Whistleblower Bill on the Move Again in the Senate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to protect so-called ``whistleblowers''
who expose government waste, fraud and abuse is back in the Senate
after a compromise between sponsors and the Bush administration.
   ``This very well might be the first bill to be signed by the
president this year,'' Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said at a news
conference Tuesday in which sponsors unveiled a revised version of
the measure.
   The bill would ease the way for federal employees to win
reinstatement if demoted or fired after disclosing mismanagement.
   Then-President Ronald Reagan blocked the measure by a pocket
veto, meaning he refused to sign the bill and Congress was out of
session at the time. He said it could result in the government
fighting legal battles against itself.
   Reagan's move received heavy criticism in a surprised Congress
and from Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Lawmakers agreed under the compromise to give up a provision of
last year's bill that would have allowed a special counsel
representing employees to go to court, said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   In turn, the administration agreed to a provision barring the
special counsel from opposing whistleblowers in any action before
the Merit Systems Protection Board, the agency that enforces civil
service safeguards.
   The administration also agreed to greater privacy protection
under the bill, while the senators approved a minor rewording under
which employees are deemed whistleblowers if their exposure of
waste, fraud or abuse was ``a contributing factor'' in the decision
to discipline them. The change inserted the word ``contributing.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh promised in a letter to Levin
``our cooperation to discourage any amendments, in either body of
Congress, that might in any way interfere with this agreement.''
   ``None of the changes to which we have agreed detracts in any way
from the Congress' intent to strengthen whistleblower protections,''
the letter said.

<HEAD>Mayor Wins Democratic Primary In St. Louis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl, seeking to become
only the third mayor in city history to gain a third term, easily
won the Democratic primary on Tuesday against two oppponents.
   In final, unofficial results, Schoemehl had 36,743 ballots, or
61.5 percent of the vote, to former Alderman Michael V. Roberts, who
had 20,581. A third candidate, retired businessman John Noel, had
2,382.
   Schoemehl's nomination would be tantamount to a third four-year
term in the heavily Democratic city. The general election will be
held April 4.
   ``This has been a tremendous day for St. Louis,'' Schoemehl said.
``We in fact have a very bright future in the track that we are on.''
   In the Republican mayoral primary, auto repair shop owner Bernard
J. Elking edged Joan F. Lang, who owns a pet grooming shop, by 31
votes. Elking had 928 votes to 897 for Lang. Roy Lang, a used tire
dealer who is not related to the other candidate, had 138 votes.
   Voters also cast ballots for aldermen in 10 of the city's 28
wards.
   Election commissioner Jerry B. Wamser had predicted that fewer
than a third of the city's 216,500 voters would participate in the
wake of a late winter storm that dumped 11 inches of snow on the
area Sunday and Monday. By late Tuesday, that estimate was
downgraded to possibly only 25 percent in spite of temperatures that
rose to the low 30s.

<HEAD>Voter Turnout Again Down Except Among the Elderly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older Americans flexed their political muscles
last November, while interest in choosing a new president flagged
among other age groups, the Census Bureau reports.
   Some 68.8 percent of people aged 65 and over reported going to
the polls last fall, the only age group to show an increase from the
election four years earlier, according to the analysis released on
Tuesday. Senior citizens voted at a 67.7 percent rate in 1984.
   ``The elderly have been getting a lot of attention and have
become a great deal more active then ever before,'' said Census
Bureau statistician Jerry Jennings. ``They are becoming a much more
self-conscious group than before and are beginning to recognize
their power.''
   While the over-65 group was tops in turnout, the 45-to-64 age
segment wasn't far behind at 67.9 percent last November. But that
was down from 69.8 percent four years earlier.
   Turnout by voters aged 25 to 44 fell from 58.4 percent to 54.0
percent, and in the 18 to 24 group it dropped from 40.8 percent to
36.2 percent.
   Overall, the Census analysis found voter turnout down 3
percentage points from 1984 and _ at 57 percent _ the lowest since
the bureau began asking about voting in 1964.
   As usual, more people told the Census Bureau they had voted than
there were votes actually cast, a phenomenon which the bureau gently
terms ``misreporting.''
   The total vote amounted to about 50 percent of the number of
people of voting age in the country, the post-election count found.
   But when the Census Bureau surveyed about 55,000 households two
weeks after the election, 57.4 percent reported having gone to the
polls.
   Does that mean people lie to the census takers?
   ``Yes,'' said Jennings, ``That's the greater part of it.''
   The purpose of the survey is not to find out how many people
voted _ to do that you have to count the votes, Jennings pointed out.
   The survey compares the turnout among regions and groups of
people. That comparison is valid, he said, ``with one group
misreporting about as much as another.''
   Either way, it was a 3 percentage point drop from 1984 and the
lowest turnout in many years.
   At 57 percent, the Census figure is the lowest ever recorded by
that agency, while the national vote total hasn't been as low as
half in a presidential year since 1924, according to figures
compiled by the private Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate.
   The drop in turnout was greatest for blacks and Hispanics, the
Census study found.
   ``By and large, when there is a change in voter turnout it is
greatest in segments of the population which have the lowest turnout
to begin with,'' Jennings said. ``I suspect that is what is
happening here.''
   Only 51.5 percent of voting-age blacks said they had cast
ballots, down from 55.8 percent four years earlier. For Hispanics
the decline was from 32.6 percent to 28.8 percent.
   The white turnout fell from 61.4 percent to 59.2 percent between
1984 and 1988.
   Women held their lead over males in voting, 58.3 percent to 56.4
percent last year. In 1984 women had led 60.8 percent to 59.0
percent.
   As usual, the Midwest topped the nation last fall with 62.9
percent reporting they voted, a drop from 65.7 percent in 1984. The
Northeast was second at 57.4 percent, down from 59.7 percent.
   Turnout in the West fell from 58.5 percent to 55.6 percent, while
in the South it dropped from 56.8 percent to 54.5 percent between
1984 and 1988.
   Education seems to encourage voting, with 77.6 percent of college
graduates turning out. Next were people with some college, 64.5
percent and then high school graduates, 54.7 percent. Only 41.3
percent of those who hadn't finished high school voted, and turnout
was 36.7 percent for people who hadn't gone beyond grade school.
   People with jobs outvoted the unemployed, 58.4 percent to 38.6
percent. People who own their own home turned out at a 70.0 percent
rate, while only 39.8 percent of renters reported voting.
   Because it is based on a survey the study can be subject to
sampling error. The Census Bureau estimates the margin of error for
the overall turnout at four-tenths of 1 percent.

<HEAD>Administration Promises to Spare Landsat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Landsat earth-sensing satellites appear to
be getting a reprieve, with an administration pledge to keep them
running and a variety of federal agencies being asked to foot the
bill.
   The two satellites had been threatened with a shutdown when funds
ran out on March 31.
   But Thonas N. Pyke Jr. of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reported that while details remain to be worked out,
the administration is committed to keep the satellite system running.
   A shutdown would have amounted to ``turning off the lights,
closing the door and retiring from the field,'' of remote sensing,
said Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Science
subcommittee on natural resources.
   The federal agencies that make the most use of the satellite data
are being asked to contribute to keep the system operating after
March 31, Pyke told the subcommittee. It will cost about $9.4
million to keep the system running for the rest of the fiscal year.
   Science Committee Chairman Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., told the
subcommittee that he has a meeting scheduled with Vice President Dan
Quayle to discuss details of the funding. Quayle has been
coordinating the new Landsat funding as head of the National Space
Council.
   ``We've got to stop this damned nonsense,'' Roe said of the
Landsat funding problem. Funding was a continuing battle under the
Reagan administration, which initiated the transfer of the system to
private hands.
   That transfer, to the Earth Observation Satellite Company, is
incomplete. Federal money is still used in operating the satellites,
which measure land use, water flow, vegetation and mineral locations
and provide detailed mapping information.
   The two satellites are currently beyond their original design
lifetimes. A replacement, Landsat 6, isn't scheduled for launch
until 1991.
   In the meantime, Landsats 4 and 5 continue to supply useful data.
If they are turned off for lack of funds the only source for similar
information would be the French SPOT-Image satellite system or the
Soviet Union.
   Pyke told the subcommittee that the EOSAT company, the private
firm handling the Landsat data, has been asked to contribute part of
the funding to keep the satellites running, but no commitment has
been received.
   Federal agencies that seem likely sources of funds, he said,
include the Departments of Defense, Agriculture and Interior and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Rep. Lamar S. Smith, R-Texas, urged that the Department of Energy
and the National Science Foundation be asked for assistance as well.
   ``It's an absolute shame that we've come to this juncture,''
concluded Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla. He termed threatening to shut
down the satellites a ``pretty expensive game of chicken.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush News Conferences Abound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, forced by a winter storm to
cancel a trip to Pennsylvania and Delaware, decided it was ``an
opportune moment to stay indoors.'' So he held a news conference.
   In office barely six weeks, Bush already has been meeting with
reporters with greater frequency than any president since Franklin
D. Roosevelt.
   Former President Reagan only held three news conference in his
final year in office _ a level Bush surpassed in his first month.
   Tuesday's session was the third general-purpose news conference
that Bush has held in the White House, although he has yet to make
an appearance in prime time. He also held forth at some length at a
Feb. 6 news conference in the Old Executive Office Building called
to announce his plan to bail out failed savings and loans.
   And he fielded wide-ranging questions twice, on successive days,
in Tokyo during his trip earlier this month to northeast Asia.
   White House aides cite these appearances to assert that Bush has
held six news conferences so far _ although the definition of a news
conference in the Bush White House remains a bit blurry.
   That's partly Bush's doing. Since he says he won't answer
questions at picture-taking sessions, any time he decides to break
his own rule the session becomes a mini-news conference. Sometimes
the White House chalks it up as an ``Oval Office Press Session.''
   Counting these sessions, add three more to the list of Bush
question-and-answers encounters with reporters, says deputy press
secretary B. Jay Cooper.
   These, plus a joint news conference Bush held in Ottawa with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on Feb. 10, raises to 10 the
number of times Bush as president has stood or sat before
microphones and answered questions from reporters in a more-or-less
orderly fashion.
   Bush's moving target for ground rules on what constitutes a
picture-taking session, or so-called ``photo op,'' and what
constitutes a news conference, has led to some convoluted
presidential verbiage.
   For instance, the other day when he wanted to make a statement
but take no questions, he declared the event to be: ``a modified
limited photo op cum statement, sans questions.''
   Bush himself is keeping track of his accessibility.
   After one recent session at which he took a few questions, Bush
was overheard boasting about his availability to lawmakers sitting
with him in the Cabinet Room.
   ``I want these stats out there (on how many times he's taken
questions) in case there is a dry spell,'' Bush said.
   For the record, Roosevelt held 998 news conferences during his 15
years in office, or an average 6.9 per month, according to the
Gannett Center for Media Studies.
   Other recent presidents and their per-month averages: Truman, 324
or 3.5 per month; Eisenhower, 193 or 2 per month; Kennedy, 64 or 1.8
per month; Johnson, 135 or 2.2 per month; Nixon, 37 or 0.6 per
month; Ford, 39 or 1.3 per month; Carter, 59 or 1.2 per month;
Reagan, 50 or 0.5 per month.

   When you're a 28-year-old civilian in a roomful of top military
brass, there is something to be said for having an authoritative
voice.
   At the Pentagon the other day, the military leaders of the United
States, awaiting a visit from their commander-in-chief, snapped to
attention when White House press aide Bruce Zanca called out ``stand
by.''
   The room was abuzz with chatter among the Joint Chiefs of Staff
until Zanca's two words brought the military men to immediate and
complete silence.
   ``I was just letting the cameramen and you guys know he was
coming,'' a sheepish Zanca told reporters with a grin.

<HEAD>More of Livestock Industry in Hands of Fewer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The livestock industry is growing even more
concentrated in the hands of relatively few operators, says an
Agriculture Department analyst.
   ``While there are still thousands of small livestock producers,
their number has declined substantially in recent decades,'' says
Ken Nelson of the department's Economic Research Service. ``In 1987,
the four largest slaughter firms accounted for 67 percent of steer
and heifer slaughter, up from 35 percent in 1979.''
   Meanwhile, the market share of the four companies for hog
slaughter increased to 37 percent from 34 percent. The share for
sheep and lamb slaughter rose to 75 percent 1987 from 64 percent in
1979.
   ``Among producers, cattle feedlots show a high degree of
concentration,'' Nelson said. ``Of 42,081 feedlots in the 13 major
feeding states, which account for 90 percent of all fed (cattle)
marketings in the U.S., the 200 largest accounted for nearly half of
the 1987 marketings.''
   Nelson, who writes in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said firms merge and take over other companies to ``to
improve efficiency in management and production, and perhaps to gain
market power.'' Some practice vertical integration by taking over at
least two stages of the production and marketing pipeline.
   ``For example, Cargill and ConAgra, both major processors, have
interests in grain marketing, livestock and poultry production, and
meat processing,'' he said. ``Some firms expand horizontally by
acquiring other firms in different industries. The diversification
cuts risks if one industry goes into a decline.''
   The trend to fewer meat packers means fewer potential livestock
buyers in local markets, and Nelson said shifts from organized
public markets toward direct sales to packers have cut market
contacts for many small producers.
   ``Larger packers also have acquired some country buying points
formerly owned by cooperatives or small marketing firms,'' he said.
``In a recent survey, producers said they had fewer bidders for
their livestock in 1988 than in 1982.''
   By and large, Nelson said, the worries of consumers, small
processors and small producers focus on the growing market power of
the big companies. They fear the big firms are cutting prices
received by small farmers and are boosting consumer meat prices.
   Nelson said the growth of big companies also gives rise to fears
of discrimination against independent suppliers, small customers and
workers. There are also fears of predatory pricing to force out
small competitors.
   But consolidation ``could be beneficial'' if such fears and
concerns are dealt with, he said. Livestock production and
processing show economies of scale, where larger size of operations
lowers the per unit costs of production.
   ``Large firms can benefit from such economies and at the same
time invest in product and market development,'' Nelson said. ``Such
firms can pass on savings to farmers and consumers _ savings that
would not be possible in a less concentrated livestock and meat
industry.''
   The question, he said, is who benefits.
   ``When a few firms dominate, the cost savings could stay mostly
with the firms,'' Nelson said. ``Where there is competition, the
savings ultimately will show up as lower consumer prices. One way to
keep the benefits of bigness and foster competition is to open up
world livestock and meat markets to more international competition.''

   Despite smaller yields because of last year's
drought, vegetable producers nationwide probably took in a record
dollar value for their crops, says the Agriculture Department.
   Although there was no estimate for 1988, growers' receipts
``likely increased slightly'' from the record level of $9.2 billion
in 1987 because of higher prices, the department's Economic Research
Service said Tuesday.
   ``Total output of vegetables probably fell about 4 percent in
1988 because of declines in potato, dry bean and processing
vegetable production,'' the agency said in an outlook report.
``Assuming normal weather, output should rebound in 1989.''
   Per capita use of vegetables, which probably declined in 1988
because of smaller production, is expected to return to pre-drought
levels this year.
   ``Utilization probably will continue to be enhanced by general
economic conditions in the United States,'' the report said. ``With
real disposable incomes and employment remaining relatively strong,
domestic demand for all types of vegetable should continue robust.''
   Exports of fresh vegetables, which soared in 1988, are expected
to continue rising this year, reflecting the decline in the dollar
and growth in the Japanese market, the report said.
   One reason for the export increase is a rise in french fry
shipments to Pacific Rim countries.
   Potato prices paid to growers are projected to average even
higher than the department's initial forecast of $5.49 per
hundredweight, the report said. Last year's average was $4.35 per
100 pounds. As a result, potato farmers are expected to expand their
1989 acreage.

   The Agriculture Department says private
exporters have sold China an additional 400,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Melvin E. Sims, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Tuesday the wheat was part of 2
million tons authorized Feb. 27 for China under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sims said the latest sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 150,000
tons; and Louis Dreyfus Corp., 250,000 tons.
   The wheat was sold for shipment in April and May and will carry
an average subsidy rate of $22.19 per ton, or about 60 cents a
bushel, he said. Slightly more than 1.6 million tons are still
available under the current authorization.

<HEAD>Justice Department Promises Stricter Antitrust Enforcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's antitrust chief is
promising tougher enforcement of laws to preserve competition in the
airlines industry.
   Assistant Attorney General Charles F. Rule said in a speech
Tuesday that the antitrust division would take a harder look at
mergers than did the Transportation Department, which gave up its
authority to review airline deals at the end of 1988.
   ``Perhaps somewhat overlooked by DOT in the course of
deregulating the airline industry, the antitrust laws have a
valuable role to play to ensure that a competitive environment does
not sow the seeds of its own demise,'' Rule told the International
Aviation Club.
   ``The antitrust division intends to use its new-found authority _
as well as pre-existing authority _ to apply those laws with
appropriate care in order to ensure that U.S. airline markets remain
competitive in the years to come,'' Rule said.
   ``We will ask whether the merger will result in increased prices
to consumers by creating, enhancing, or facilitating the exercise of
market power without generating offsetting efficiencies,'' he said.
   Rule said that an unanticipated result of airline deregulation
has been that carriers have become entrenched in regions even though
the changes ``have generally benefited consumers by dramatically
increasing the efficiency of airline service.''
   He cited computerized reservation systems, which give their
owners an upper hand in getting bookings despite Transportation
Department rules. ``Whether or not this advantage represents an
efficiency, it does place new entrants at a disadvantage,'' he said.
   Rule did not say what position the department would take on the
proposal to merge the computerized reservation systems of American
and Delta airlines.
   ``The effect of such an acquisition of an ownership interest in a
CRS by the owner of a competing system is not at all obvious,'' Rule
said. ``Rather the effects are likely to be very complex and involve
a tradeoff of costs and benefits. Our investigation of the
American@Delta agreement should enlighten us about the nature of
that tradeoff.''
   Combinations of airlines that have regional hubs in the same city
would be opposed by the antitrust division, which unsuccessfully
urged the Transportation Department not to allow the TWA-Ozark and
the Northwest-Republic mergers, Rule said.
   But Rule noted that ``there are very few such mergers that are
even conceivable today.''
   In recent years, the Transportation Department approved nearly
two dozen airline mergers, prompting criticism from consumer groups
that it was giving the industry too free a hand.
   The Transportation Department's administrative authority lapsed
on Dec. 31, 1988. The Justice Department now has jurisdiction over
airline mergers as it does in other industries.
   Conn Hitchcock, director of the aviation law project of Public
Citizen, a consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader: ``We'll
have to see if words are accompanied by deeds. The American-Delta
merger will provide some important clues.''

<HEAD>Guerrilla Leader Says Backing from ASEAN Weakening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cambodian resistance's main backer,
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has lessened its once
firm support for a U.N. peacekeeping force in postwar Cambodia and
for other key resistance proposals, a guerrilla leader says.
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh also said Tuesday that he would leave
for the United States this weekend to ask Washington for more covert
aid to force Vietnam to be more flexible at the negotiating table.
   The resistance has repeatedly requested arms, but Washington
provides only limited non-lethal aid.
   Ranariddh is the son of central Cambodian resistance leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and commands one of three guerrilla groups
resisting Vietnam's 10-year-old occupation of Cambodia.
   He told a group of reporters that ASEAN's support for the
resistance proposals weakened at peace talks last month in
Indonesia. ASEAN mediated those talks, which brought together
Vietnam and the warring factions in Cambodia.
   Ranariddh said he was troubled by the shift.
   He said only a U.N. peacekeeping force can prevent renewed
fighting and a return of Vietnamese troops, who have said they hope
to withdraw next year, or by brutal Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
   Vietnam and the government it installed in Cambodia have opposed
introducing an armed international force.
   ``I am very sorry for the sake of my people that the ASEAN stand
is not as firm as before,'' Ranariddh told a group of reporters.
   He said a majority of ASEAN delegates at the conference did not
support an international peackeeping force and no longer clearly
support the idea of an interim postwar government under Prince
Sihanouk's leadership and comprised of the three resistance factions
and the Vietnam-backed regime.
   ``They do not support even the idea of having free
self-determination and free elections in Cambodia,'' he said.
   In 1982, ASEAN sponsored the formation of the guerrilla
coalition. It gives the group sanctuary and arms and leads the
diplomatic struggle against Vietnam. The non-Communist ASEAN
includes Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and the
Philippines.
   The guerrilla coalition joins the nationalist forces of Sihanouk
and Son Sann with a group they strongly distrust, the militarily
potent Khmer Rouge. The fanatical Communist group killed hundreds of
thousands of people when it ruled Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam
ousted it in the late 1978 invasion.
   Ranariddh would not name the ASEAN countries whose support had
weakened, nor say why that support had weakened. He said, however,
that said a notable exception was Singapore's Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew.
   In January, Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan was host to
an unprecedented visit to Thailand by Hun Sen, premier of Cambodia's
Vietnamese-installed government.
   Some diplomats said Chatichai has seriously weakened the
resistance in his rush to get a settlement and transform Cambodia's
battlefields into markets for Thai goods. Ranariddh has said his
father, who had quit as resistance coalition president, resumed the
post in February to counter the increasing worldwide support for Hun
Sen.
   Ranariddh said that during his trip to Washington he would tell
officials that other steps are needed to weaken the Khmer Rouge
aside from U.S. attempts to pressure China to halt its aid to them.
   He expressed optimism that China, which arms the guerrillas, and
the Soviet Union, which arms Vietnam, will reach an agreement on
Cambodia during their summit in May. He said they recently had
converged on many points and all that remains was for the Soviets to
guarantee a Vietnamese pullout and the Chinese to guarantee in turn
that the Khmer Rouge will not return to power.
   ``If they will overcome this, (the settlement is) finished,''
Ranariddh said.

   NBC extended its prime-time ratings victory
streak to 37 weeks, and Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married...With
Children'' fell a few points after coming under attack for alleged
lewdness.
   NBC placed its four Thursday night comedies in the top 10, with
``The Cosby Show'' in first place and ``A Different World'' in
second, ``Cheers'' in fourth and ``Dear John'' tied for 10th,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Other shows in the top 10 were ABC's ``Roseanne'' third; NBC's
``The Golden Girls,'' fifth; CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' sixth; ABC's
``Who's the Boss?'' seventh; ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' just moved
from Wednesday, eighth; and NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' 10th.
   NBC dominated the week with a 16.1 rating. ABC and CBS tied week
with 12.6.
   Each ratings point represents 904,000 homes with television.
   ``Married...With Children'' had an 11.4 rating and fell to 54th
place after a Michigan mother's allegations that the show was ``lewd
and anti-family'' gained national attention last week. The previous
week it finished in 46th place and had a 12.5 rating.
   CBS was first among the evening news shows with a rating of 11.5.
ABC had 11.2 and NBC 10.5.

   President Bush says he's been told by a fellow
from Lubbock, Texas, not to worry about all the inside-Washington
talk about an administration aimless and adrift. ``All the people in
Lubbock think things are going just great,'' the president says.
   If Bush wants assurance that the people will tell him when things
are going just great, and not so great, all he has to do is wander
down Pennsylvania Avenue to the National Archives, storehouse of the
nation's records. An exhibition there celebrates 200 years of the
people petitioning the government _ or giving it a piece of its mind.
   Exhibit A along those lines comes from a boy named Anthony, who
was in H.B. Milnes School at Fair Lawn, N.J., when President Ford
pardoned President Nixon for the crimes of Watergate. Anthony had a
fixed mixed opinion:
   ``Dear President Ford,
   ``I think you are half right and half wrong.
   ``Yours truly,
   ``Anthony Ferreira.''
   Bush, replacing Reaganites with Bushites, also would find
familiar echoes in the 1789 complaint of Mary Katherine Goodard, who
lost her job as postmaster of Baltimore after serving through the
tough days of the Revolutionary War.
   Said her petition: ``She hath been discharged without the
smallest imputations of any fault, and without any previous notice
whatever. ... These are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years
faithful services, performed in the worst of times.''
   To no avail. She didn't get reinstated.
   The Constitution's First Amendment gives the people the right
``to petition the government for a redress of grievances.'' But even
before the government existed, the American people were exercising
their right to talk back to authority.
   In 1773, the governor of Connecticut petitioned a member of the
British Parliament to protest the closing of the port of Boston in
retaliation for the Boston Tea Party. He wrote, ``We are at a loss
to conceive how the destruction of the East India Company's tea
could be a just or reasonable ground for punishing so severely
thousands of innocent people.''
   Seventeen years later, Pennsylvania Quakers petitioned for the
abolition of slavery: ``The blessings of liberty ... ought
rightfully to be administered, without distinction of colour, to all
descriptions of people.''
   Some petitions to government have been eloquent, some funny, some
moving.
   Annie Davis, a slave from northern Maryland whose mistress
refused to let her join her family, wrote to President Lincoln. She
urgently wanted to know her status: ``You will please let me know if
we are free ...''
   One of the biggest petitions ever to reach Washington remains in
the condition received in 1893 _ rolled up on two huge wooden spools
nearly seven feet high. It consists hundreds of sheets, taped
together, bearing an estimated 150,000 signatures, appealing for a
new bureaucracy.
   ``We the undersigned ... hereby most respectfully petition that
there be founded ... a Road Department, similar to the Agriculture
Department, for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the art of
constructing and maintaining roads.''
   Congress obliged by creating the Office of Road Inquiry in the
Department of Agriculture. Must have pleased the petition's creator,
a bicycle manufacturer.
   Few petitions have had as deep an impact as the one Earl Gideon
wrote in pencil in 1961 from his prison cell in Bay County, Fla.,
where he was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom. ``The
question is very simple. I requested the court to appoint me an
attorney and the court refused.''
   The Supreme Court agreed. Its landmark Gideon decision upheld the
right of poor defendants to be represented by lawyers, at the public
expense if need be.
   In the midst of the Depression, Franklin Roosevelt got a petition
from some young citizens of the Cream Street School in Hyde Park,
N.Y., protesting the removal of a teacher: ``Do we have to have
another teacher when we want Mrs. Sheridan so much? Mr. Roosevelt
you do so many big things, can't you find a way to help us in this
little thing? Because this is a big thing to us kids. It's a pretty
tough `new deal' for us young Democrats and Republicans.''
   But even FDR knew the limits of his powers. Mrs. Sheridan, like
Postmistress Goodard, didn't get her job back, the petitions of the
people notwithstanding.

<HEAD>Senate Tempers Wear Thin in Tower Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flattery is the first and firmest rule in the
Senate, but in a single day the debate on Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower produced a series of mutual attacks
on integrity, motives and competence.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole touched off Tuesday's fireworks
when he announced that Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., had detailed investigators to check new allegations against
Tower.
   ``Partisan unit,'' Dole later called it. ``Strike force.''
   ``Highly questionable if not inappropriate,'' Republican Sen.
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said. ``I think it needs to be pursued
to see where it leads us.''
   Nunn, leader of the Tower opposition, defended himself a short
while later by saying he had been informed the FBI would no longer
look into allegations against Tower.
   He then was asked about Republican claims that his effort to
derail Tower is really an attempt to grab power for himself at the
Pentagon, or perhaps jockey for position in the 1992 White House
campaign.
   ``It's an onslaught,'' he said, ``The basic rule is if you don't
have the facts on your side, you try to destroy the credibility of
someone who is presenting them on the other side. So I think that
formula is in full effect right now.''
   And when Democrat Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said that an FBI
report on Tower turned up evidence of ``wrongdoing,'' Republican
Warren Rudman of New Hampshire replied tartly. That wasn't so, he
said _ at least not the way Americans use the term.
   ``I'm an American, too,'' shot back DeConcini.
   Hearing DeConcini's retort, Rudman persisted that Tower had
committed no legal wrongdoing.
   Shot back DeConcini, ``In my judgment it's wrong. OK?''
   But the sharpest exchanges were saved for an extraordinary late
afternoon performance. Roughly 30 senators stayed in their seats for
the debate, the ultimate courtesy in an institution where most
lawmakers come to the Senate chamber only to cast their votes before
hurrying back to their offices.
   They saw an exchange between Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Rudman, who said it was a ``fact'' that there
was no evidence in the FBI report that Tower had ever been impaired
by alcohol in performing his duties.
   Mitchell, a former judge, interrupted to say that was Rudman's
opinion, not a fact.
   Rudman said he had spent 24 years practicing law, and knew how to
read evidence.
   ``I think I know how to do that just as well as you do,'' said
Mitchell, who is a former federal judge as well as a lawyer.
   ``I'm sure,'' shot back Rudman, a former New Hampshire attorney
general.
   Nothing was too good to pass up as partisan feelings boiled over.
   Dole complained bitterly that Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. was
guilty of ``vicious personal attacks'' for earlier citing
allegations contained in the FBI report from witnesses who said they
had seen Tower ``crocked,'' ``sloshed,'' and ``comatose.''
   Hollings protested, but Dole persisted that the South Carolinian
was an insulter of longstanding. He referred to the ``comment he
once made about the senator from Ohio'' and later referred to a
long-ago crack about the ``senator from Texaco.''
   The first was a reference to Hollings' description of Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum years ago as the senator from B'nai B'rith. The second
was Hollings' one-time description of Texas Democrat Lloyd Bentsen.
   Amidst the partisan crossfire, Dole's irritation with one of his
Republican colleagues, Virginia's John Warner, slipped out.
   Dole said that as the senior Republican on the Armed Services
Committee, Warner had known what Nunn was doing but had not passed
the word along to the Republican leadership.
   ``I don't know why he didn't tell me,'' Dole said of his Virginia
colleague.
   ``He should have.''

   Bryant Gumbel and Willard Scott sought to patch
things up on a special ``Today'' show hookup, but the critical
co-host balked at reciting the weatherman's pledge against computer
memo writing.
   Tuesday's on-air conversation followed a botched effort Monday to
reach the vacationing Scott in Florida. ``I hung up on you,'' Scott
joked about the previous day's technical snags.
   Scott, who had threatened to leave unless Gumbel apologized for
his in-house memo criticizing Scott and other staff members, then
told the co-host to raise his right hand and recite after him.
   Gumbel raised his left hand.
   Scott: ``I, Bryant Gumbel...''
   Gumbel: ``I, Bryant Gumbel...''
   Scott: ``...will promise...''
   Gumbel: ``...will promise...''
   Scott: ``...to never write another memo and leave it in the
computer again.''
   Gumbel: ``...but I can't write in longhand.''
   The session concluded with Gumbel and co-host Jane Pauley wishing
Scott, who turned 55 on Tuesday, a happy birthday and a good
vacation.

   Actor Ben Vereen, columnist Ann Landers and
country singer Tammy Wynette were honored for their efforts to
educate the public about mental illness and addiction.
   ``I'm not proud of the fact that I once had a drug problem, but I
am proud I did something about it,'' Ms. Wynette, who overcame
dependency on prescription drugs, said Tuesday at an awards
reception on Capitol Hill.
   ``Let's be sympathetic, let's be kind, let's be caring and let's
recognize the burden these people who have mental illness are
carrying. I can't tell you how much pain, how much suffering is out
there,'' Ms. Landers urged.
   Vereen, a national spokesman for the campaign for ``A Drug Free
America,'' said parents and teachers must be educated to spot mental
illnesses such as depression that can lead to drug abuse, and then
reach out to those afflicted.
   He promised to continue the fight ``to free America from its
chains of drugs and mental illness.''
   The ``From Shame to Hope'' awards were co-sponsored by the Mental
Health Liaison Group, the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association of
North America and the Mental Illness Research Advocacy Coalition _

   An Arizona company was inviting criticism when it
sent a sample of its windshield-cleaning product to ``60 Minutes''
commentator Andy Rooney, a lawyer for CBS has argued.
   Attorney Douglas Jacobs on Monday asked U.S. District Judge
Robert Broomfield to dismiss a $16 million suit filed against the
network and its newsmagazine show by Unelko, a Scottsdale-based
company. He said the suit attacks freedom of expression.
   Robert Cummins, a lawyer for Unelko, countered that the
Constitution does not protect the snide type of ``factual
disparagement'' made by Rooney during an April 17, 1988, broadcast
of ``60 Minutes.''
   ``Nobody invited Mr. Rooney to do anything,'' Cummins said.
``Twenty million folks heard CBS and Andy Rooney declare that Rain-X
doesn't work.''
   Rooney, who attended the hearing but did not testify, said on the
air he was receiving ``junk'' in the mail. He held up a bottle of
Rain-X, which is supposed to make rain or snow roll off auto
windshields, and said he'd tried the product and found it lacking in
the advertised qualities.
   ``They can't suppress an opinion just because it doesn't agree
with theirs,'' Jacobs said.
   Broomfield took the case under advisement.

   Spanish tenor Jose Carreras, resuming his
career full-time after overcoming leukemia, said he will sing an
entire opera this summer and begin filming a movie about Enrico
Caruso in the fall.
   ``I am ready to face this challenge as a real professional, not
as a miraculously healed person,'' the singer told a news conference
at Milan's La Scala Theater Tuesday.
   Carreras, who has performed a number of concerts since he began a
comeback last year, said he will sing in Luigi Cherubini's ``Medea''
in Merida, Spain, in July. He said it would be a good test for
tougher engagements later, including a world premiere of ``Cristobal
Colon,'' by Catalonian author Lleonard Balada, in September.
   Carreras, who fell ill nearly two years ago, made his
announcement hours after an emotional two-hour concert Monday night
in the prestigious Milan theater that drew ovations from a sold-out
crowd.
   ``Carreras proved he fully regained his voice,'' the daily
Corriere della Sera wrote under the headline ``The Triumph of
Carreras.''
   The singer said he will portray Caruso in a movie that will begin
filming in October in Sorrento, near Naples, where the legendary
tenor died in 1921.

<HEAD>Bush Says Administration not Stalled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is trying to dispel an
impression that ``nothing is happening'' in his young
administration, saying it hasn't been stalled by his struggle to win
confirmation of John Tower as defense secretary.
   Bush on Tuesday responded to news reports that his administration
is adrift by recounting actions he has taken such as developing a
savings and loan rescue plan, meeting with foreign leaders and
presenting a budget package to Congress.
   ``My response is it's not adrift and there isn't malaise,'' he
said. ``I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be
bubbling around, that nothing is happening. A lot is happening. Not
all of it good, but a lot is happening.''
   Bush, in an impromptu news conference, also reiterated his
opposition to White House intervention in the Eastern Airlines
strike. He said pilots threatening a slowdown to support the
striking machinists should not ``make the innocent traveling public
a pawn in this dispute.''
   Bush continued to stand by Tower, as he picked up a piece of good
news in the Senate fight over confirmation _ a second Democrat, Sen.
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, announced he would vote for the
nominee.
   ``I believe he is the best man for the job,'' the president said
of Tower. ``I'm not going to pull back on this.''
   He noted that Tower has pledged not to take another drink if
confirmed, and said, ``You'll have 25,000 people in the Pentagon
making sure that's true.''
   To counter allegations that his administration is stalled, Bush
cited a phone conversation with a friend in Lubbock, Texas, who told
him, ``All the people in Lubbock think things are going just great.''
   The friend was campaign contributor Robert Blake, an oil and gas
businessman and longtime friend of Bush.
   ``I think we're on track,'' Bush said.
   Bush was responding to news reports that the uphill Tower
confirmation fight has diverted attention from other administration
business, particularly appointment of key personnel, and that after
six weeks Bush's presidency is floundering.
   Bush said he would like to see his appointments move more
quickly, but he claimed that he is ahead of where the Reagan
administration was on appointments at this point in 1981.
   He acknowledged that trouble in getting a defense secretary
confirmed was ``an inhibiting factor'' in completing a strategic
review on defense but said, ``I hope there's not going to be any
slippage'' in meeting a May 10 deadline.
   Bush also said he has ``total confidence'' in his White House
chief of staff, John Sununu, the former New Hampshire governor who
has been criticized for alleged tactical errors in the Tower
nomination struggle.
   On other subjects, Bush said:
   _He has directed his nominee for drug policy coordinator, William
Bennett, to look into ways to block criminal use of semiautomatic
assault guns. The president, a member of the National Rifle
Association, previously said he opposed banning such weapons. But he
said he told Bennett he would take a hard look at any ``sensible
answer'' the drug czar proposes.
   _There ``has to be some linkage'' between U.S. policy toward the
Soviets and the Kremlin's behavior in Central America. Reiterating
that he will push at the end of this month for new humanitarian aid
for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, Bush indicated he is looking to
the Soviets to pull back on their military aid to the ruling
Sandinista government there.
   _He is as committed to human rights as former President Reagan
was, though Bush didn't publicly focus on the issue even when
Chinese authorities prevented the nation's leading dissident from
attending a dinner Bush invited him to in Beijing. Bush said ``quiet
discussion'' is the best way to voice human rights concerns.
   He did not mention Chinese actions in Tibet, where demonstrators
are protesting Chinese occupation and report widespread human rights
abuses.

<HEAD>Random Testing Finds Drugs in Air Controllers, Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers were the largest single
group of federal employees to test positive for illegal drugs under
the government's program of random testing, a published report says.
   The Washington Post reported today that 203 federal workers have
tested positive out of the 30,307 employees tested so far in the
random, spot-checking urinalysis program. That translates into a
rate of 0.7 percent.
   Among those testing positive were 60 air traffic controllers and
42 employees in the nuclear and chemical weapons security program,
the newspaper reported.
   The remaining 101 were in a number of positions, including jobs
involving aviation safety, enforcement of drug laws and
rehabilitation of drug users.
   The overwhelming majority of those testing positive had used
marijuana, which can be detected in the urine as long as two months
after being smoked. Urine samples from 47 employees showed traces of
cocaine, which can remain in the body for three days.
   ``Nobody has been caught who has his finger over the button, or
even anybody directly in contact with nuclear or chemical weapons,''
said Paige Eversole, an Army spokesperson.
   John K. Wallace III, special counsel to the assistant attorney
general of the civil division, said, ``The real danger comes from
inattention, from an unsafe condition someone doesn't notice'' at a
nuclear or chemical weapon site.
   When job applicants and workers who were acting suspiciously are
included with workers caught up in random tests, at least 49,751
people have been tested, with the results revealing a drug-use rate
of 0.6 percent among reporting agencies, the Post said.

<HEAD>Government Says Soviets Massacred Polish Soldiers During WWII</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it has concluded what
most Poles have long accepted as fact: that Soviet forces, not Nazi
troops, systematically massacred more than 4,000 interned Polish
army officers during World War II.
   The statement on Tuesday represented Communist authorities' first
official rejection of the longtime Soviet line on the Katyn massacre
_ perhaps the most sensitive and emotional issue in Soviet-Polish
relations.
   ``We think that everything indicates that the crime was committed
by the Stalinist NKVD,'' the KGB's predecessor, government spokesman
Jerzy Urban said during his weekly news conference.
   The Polish government also pressed the Soviet Union to speed its
review of the incident. The official Soviet news agency Tass did not
report the development.
   The announcement comes at a crucial moment in monthlong talks
between the government and opposition on restoring the legal status
of the Solidarity free trade union movement and ending an acute
economic crisis.
   The slain officers were among 15,000 Polish reserve officers
rounded up by the invading Soviets in 1939 and Nazi troops uncovered
their bodies in 1943 from common graves in the Katyn forest near the
Soviet city of Smolensk.
   Each had been killed by a single bullet to the back of the head.
   Official Soviet and Polish histories have long held that the
officers were killed by the Nazis, who broke a non-aggression pact
and invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, but Western historians blamed
the Soviets.
   No trace was found of the other nearly 11,000 reserve officers
and many Poles consider their disappearance and the Katyn massacre a
deliberate effort by Josef Stalin to eliminate the cream of Poland's
intelligensia.
   For them, the very legitimacy of the ruling Communists in Poland
is undermined by the ruthless methods Stalin employed in seeing to
it that they came to power after the war.
   Poland and the Soviet Union formed a joint commission in 1987 to
consider the evidence on Katyn and other so-called ``blank spots''
in Polish-Soviet history. The Polish side has submitted its material
and indications have emerged of growing impatience with the Soviet
review.
   Last month, an official newspaper published a story on a wartime
Red Cross report that concludes what Western historians have long
held _ that the officers murdered at Katyn were killed by the
Soviets in 1940.
   Urban has previously said the inscription on a monument in Warsaw
blaming the Nazis for Katyn will be changed.
   On Tuesday, he said Soviet historians were analyzing historial
material on the massacre ``and are right to state that it's only
circumstantial evidence.'' But he said Poland wants the Soviets to
speed up their review of the material.
   ``The difficult process of erasing blank spots in Polish-Soviet
relations'' should serve to strengthen friendship between the two
countries and to support ``Soviet perestroika instead of damaging
it,'' Urban added.
   Poland was attacked first by the Nazis from the west and then
from the east by the Soviet Union in September 1939.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, pledging a ``new

housing problems, from discrimination to homelessness to urban
blight.
   ``I'm willing to be audacious,'' Kemp said Tuesday in his first
congressional testimony as secretary of Housing and Urban
Development.
   Members of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee
warmly welcomed Kemp, a former nine-term congressman, noting his
appearance in itself was a good sign after poor Capitol Hill
relations with President Reagan's HUD Secretary, Samuel Pierce.
   Pierce, dubbed ``Silent Sam'' by his opponents, last appeared
before the housing committee in March 1985. By contrast, Kemp
pounded the table and spoke emotionally as he vigorously testified
about his commitment to curing housing ills.
   ``Snow or sleet or rain, I think it's very symbolic that I am
here today,'' said Kemp.
   He outlined several issues where HUD will take sharp turns away
from Reagan's administration and vowed to work with Democrats and
Republicans in Congress on the housing and economic development.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has endorsed a
proposal by two senators to permanently ban cigarette smoking on all
domestic flights.
   The measure introduced Tuesday would expand the current
prohibition against smoking, which covers flights of two hours or
less and is due to expire in April 1990.
   ``The time has come to protect the health and safety of all
airline passengers,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who
co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   At the senators' news conference to announce the proposal, Koop
said such a ban is ``long overdue.''
   He cited a recent study by the National Cancer Institute which
found that passengers in non-smoking sections of airliners had
levels of nicotine in their saliva and urine similar to travelers in
smoking areas.
   The bill would leave intact the $1,000 fine that can be levied
against those violating the smoking ban, and the $2,000 penalty for
people caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms.

<NOTE>Sullivan Sees No Reason to Change Catastrophic Care Program</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan says he sees no reason to change the new catastrophic care
program financed by a surtax on elderly Americans.
   ``We're aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed
(about the financing provision) but ... we are also concerned about
the many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped out
financially by the tremendous costs of illness,'' Sullivan said
Tuesday.
   ``We feel that because this legislation has just been enacted we
don't have much experience with it yet. We'd like to follow this and
see if adjustments need to be made,'' he told the House Ways and
Means Committee.
   Leaders in the House and Senate also have been generally
unsympathetic to complaints from senior citizens who oppose the
financing provision of the program, which helps the elderly and
disabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threaten
their financial stability.
   For Medicare-eligible Americans _ those who are over 65 or
disabled _ whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least $150
a year in federal income taxes, the surtax is 15 percent of their
income tax this year. Next year it is 25 percent and it could rise
by as much as 1 percentage point a year after that.

<NOTE>Subcommittee Approves Uniform Poll Closing Bill</NOTE>

   Legislation to impose a uniform closing time
for polls across the 48 contiguous states has cleared a House
subcommittee.
   The elections subcommittee of the House Administration Committee
approved the measure Tuesday on a voice vote. Rep. Al Swift,
D-Wash., the subcommittee chairman, said he expects Congress will
approve the bill this year.
   The measure, similar to ones twice approved by the House, now
goes to the full committee.
   Election officials in the West have complained that voters in
their states sometimes decide not to vote when the winner of a
presidential election is known before their polls close and that the
drop in turnout has affected the outcome of close local races.
   Under the bill, polls would close simultaneously in the 48
contiguous states at 9 p.m. EST. In the Pacific Time Zone, daylight
saving time would be extended for a maximum of two weeks in
presidential election years. The extension would allow polls in that
time zone to close at 7 p.m. PDT.
   Alaska and Hawaii are exempt from the legislation.

   Share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on
Wednesday, erasing gains in the morning session, and the U.S. dollar
declined against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 128.73 yen, down 0.30 yen from Tuesday's

yen and 128.90 yen.

gainer the previous day, fell 100.28 points, or 0.31 percent,
closing at 31,837.66.
   After morning gains, dealers said the Nikkei started to fall on
selling that followed news of the arrests of former Labor Ministry
official Takashi Kato and Masao Tasumi, an executive of the
employment information conglomerate Recruit Co. That brought to 12
the number of people arrested in connection with a
stock-profiteering scandal involving politicians and business
leaders.
   In currency dealings, the dollar declined mainly because of
selling for profit taking, traders said.
   But the dollar-yen rate moved little in the absence of
market-affecting incentives, said one trader with a major commercial
bank in Tokyo.
   Market participants also were reluctant to make major moves
before Friday's release of U.S. employment figures for February,
said another.

   Pre-dawn arrests of 57 people on poaching
charges came under sharp attack, with one official saying residents
of the economically depressed San Luis Valley were entrapped by the
lure of fast money.
   State and federal warrants cited more than 850 alleged wildlife
violations involving bear, bobcat, elk, deer and bald and golden
eagles, among other animals.
   About 275 game officials, aided by aircraft, made the arrests
early Monday in the valley and the Taos, N.M., areas.
   Gov. Roy Romer said he had been told in advance about the raid,
but was unaware of the planned tactics, which triggered at least 30
complaints from people who said they were unnecessarily harassed.
   ``Obviously I am concerned about the feeling, the trauma in that
community,'' Romer said Tuesday at a cabinet meeting in Denver. ``I
do not criticize the fact we have to enforce the law. I simply ...
and I do not want to make judgments about how it was done. ... I
simply know that there was trauma that resulted from it.''
   Costilla County Sheriff Pete Espinoza said wildlife agents kicked
in doors, dragged people outside in their underwear at gunpoint and
improperly stopped and searched people.
   ``People were crying, babies were crying,'' he said. ``They
(wildlife officers) didn't care.''
   Galen Buterbaugh, regional director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in Denver, denied Espinoza's charges and said the sheriff
and others were worried about retaliation.
   Espinoza said he and his family have been threatened by people
who assumed he was involved in the operation. He said he sent two of
his children out of town and a third child was wearing a bulletproof
vest. His house was burned down two years ago after he angered some
residents by breaking up a disturbance at a party.
   Buterbaugh said so many agents were needed to make the arrests
because the suspects had threatened federal officials.
   The investigation targeted commercial poachers, who illegally
hunt and sell game, and used an undercover agent who posed as a
taxidermist first in Fort Garland, 175 miles south of Denver, and
later in Costilla, N.M.
   Officials said up to 100 could be arrested before the 2{-year-old
investigation ends.
   Buterbaugh said the undercover agent did not encourage poaching
and paid less than the going rate for carcasses. The area was
targeted because the agent happened to be there and because there
were reports of a huge market in illegally obtained wildlife,
Buterbaugh said.
   ``We always work to make sure that we do not create a market (for
illegal wildlife),'' he said. ``The market there was very large.''
   ``The operation was well-performed in a highly professional and
highly workmanlike fashion,'' U.S. Attorney Mike Norton said at a
news conference in Lakewood, where wildlife officials displayed
dozens of illegal trophies and carcasses that had been confiscated.
   But the sheriff said the agent, known in San Luis as John Morgan,
was known to hang out in bars and ``place orders with poachers.''
   He said that encouraged poaching and entrapped residents. The San
Luis Valley chronically posts 20 percent unemployment. One of every
three people is on government aid.
   ``For that part of the county that is unemployed, $500 or $600
sounds real good to them. They're going to go for it,'' Espinoza
said.
   Officials would not say how much the agent paid for carcasses.
   ``Why did they bring 250 people with helicopters and guns and
everything else?'' Espinoza asked. ``We're not animals; we're human
beings. I don't know what they were expecting _ a war or something?
This isn't Nicaragua.''
   San Luis town trustee Augustin Jaramillo said the board ``will
pass a resolution Wednesday asking Governor Romer to investigate the
tactics used in this so-called raid.''
   The governor did not immediately respond to the request.

<TEXT>
   Lingering fears left by the Chernobyl disaster are
partly behind the public protests that have prevented a
nuclear-powered merchant ship from entering eastern Soviet ports, a
newspaper says.
   The 860-foot Sevmorput had been anchored off Vladivostok for four
days because the city council there has refused to let the vessel
enter port, the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya said on Tuesday.
   It said officials in the Pacific port city decided March 2 not to
let the ship dock until they receive additional information about
its radiation safeguards.
   Officials of nearby Nakhodka and the northeastern Soviet region
of Magadan also refused port calls after tens of thousands of
residents protested to a radio station, the newspaper said.
   Fractures appeared in the $260 million barge carrier soon after
it began its maiden voyage Dec. 31 from the Crimean port of Kerch to
the far eastern Soviet Union, the newspaper said.
   Experts found that no radiation was released and confirmed its
``atomic heart'' was not damaged, the article said. It did not say
how the damage occurred or precisely when the incident happened.
   According to the newspaper, the ship has good safeguards and
could even withstand the crash of a jetliner or a collision with a
huge icebreaker, but it added:
   ``A deficit of information, piled on top of the invisible shadow
of the Chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation
in the region, detonated a powerful explosion of public
indignation.''
   On Saturday, the newspaper Vodny Transport said a reactor
meltdown nearly occurred Nov. 11 on the icebreaker Rossiya while it
was docked at the northern port of Murmansk. It said operator error
was responsible.
   Public opposition to nuclear power has grown since the explosion
and fire April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the
Ukraine. At least 31 people were killed and the plant spewed
radioactivity that eventually spread around the world.
   Authorities are closing a nuclear power plant in Armenia, a
region prone to earthquakes, and have canceled plans to expand other
plants.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the Sevmorput was like a ``sea
monster,'' uneconomical because of its size. It said the ship would
lose $19.3 million this year and $22.9 million in 1990.
   It described the vessel as an ``offended homeless child'' and
said every day it is idle costs $88,525.

   Chinese employees at the United Nations
must remain within 25 miles of midtown Manhattan when traveling on
personal business, U.S. officials say, citing national security.
   ``It was just a matter of standardizing the policy, adding China
to a list that includes the Soviet Union and East bloc, Cuba,
Afghanistan and the PLO,'' as well as Vietnam, Laos and Libya, said
a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   About 100 Chinese citizens are covered by the regulation, which
took effect Jan. 26.
   The Soviet Union, China and other communist countries apply
similar restrictions to U.S. government workers in their countries
to curb espionage activity.
   ``Certain travel restrictions are applied for reasons of national
security to secretariat and mission personnel from some member
states,'' said Patricia M. Byrne, a U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.
   ``In no way, however, is official travel by or on behalf of the
United Nations affected,'' she said Tuesday.
   Miss Byrne was speaking before the Committee on Relations with
the Host Country, answering criticism from the Chinese Mission and
from U.N. legal advisers.
   The United States and China gradually have been tightening
restrictions on each other's diplomats since 1984, when a U.S.
consulate opened in the northeast Chinese city of Shenyang, near the
North Korean border.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has repeatedly
protested such restrictions on U.N. staff members ``solely on the
basis of their nationality.''
   U.N. headquarters in New York employs about 13,500 people.

<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, offering a rare glimpse
inside the workings of the Kremlin, says reformers began planning
changes in the Soviet system two years before Mikhail S. Gorbachev
came to power.
   He said planning for perestroika, Gorbachev's program of economic
and social reform, began in 1983, about the time former KGB chief
Yuri Andropov became Soviet leader.
   ``Even at that time, we had forces who understood that everything
was not healthy in our economy,'' Ryzhkov told 33 female journalists
gathered in St. Catherine's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace on the
eve of International Women's Day.
   Ryzkhov's frank remarks touched on details of his personal life
and frustration with the slow pace of reform.
   He promised to reveal the long-secret Soviet defense budget in 12
to 18 months, after accountants have arranged it in a form
comparable to U.S. figures, apparently for use in arms negotiations.
   As part of the plan to shift Soviet spending ``from swords to
plowshares,'' defense factories that produce 60 percent military
hardware and 40 percent consumer goods will move to a 50-50 ratio by
1991 and 40-60 by 1995, he said.
   For example, the Moscow Aviation Factory soon will produce pasta,
he said.
   Ryzhkov said he found the slow pace of economic reform the most
upsetting part of his job.
   ``I like to see how the decisions we are taking in the state
bodies are implemented in the level of real life,'' he said. That is
why he enjoys visiting factories that remind him of the Ural
Machine-Building Plant in Sverdlovsk where his career began, ``to
feel the smell of machine parts being manufactured, the smell of
real work,'' he said.
   Ryzhkov blamed part of the country's problems on corrupt
bureaucrats. He also said 40 percent of factory equipment must be
replaced.
   ``We have to make certain investments, we have to have know-how,
and we have to have time for that,'' he said.
   The premier also tackled the notorious shortage of laundry soap.
   ``In Moscow, we used to sell 80 tons of detergent daily. Now we
sell 300 tons daily, and still we have lines for detergent.'' Then
he quipped, ``I don't believe the overall washing has increased all
that much.''
   He suggested that journalists created a self-fulfilling prophecy
by publicizing a soap shortage until people began hoarding even more.
   To eliminate shortages, he said, wages must stop rising faster
than retail trade and productivity.
   In an unusual discussion of his personal life, Ryzhkov said he
answers his own phone in a 13-hour to 14-hour workday, and continues
work at home. As a result, he misses the theater and concerts.
   The 59-year-old premier said his wife, Ludmila, is a mechanical
engineer who designed excavators at the same factory where he rose
to director.
   He said she reads extensively on the countries they visit and
works on behalf of orphans.
   Ryzhkov said his daughter is a law professor at the Academy of
the Interior Ministry, and her husband also is a lawyer, in the
customs office. They have two children, Ludmila, 2, and Nikolai, 6.
   Women already hold 25 percent of the management jobs in the
Soviet Union, and this should expand under perestroika, Ryzhkov said.
   ``Until now, administrative methods were more suited to a man
with a loud voice,'' he said. ``Now we have to control the economy
not with a shout but with an intellect, and that will allow women to
have their say.''

<HEAD>Two Antarctic Islands Really Icebergs, Says Expedition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A German scientific expedition to
Antarctica says two islands marked on maps since 1961 do not exist
and were probably mistaken for huge icebergs, New Zealand Press
Association reported today.
   The agency said the expedition had gone to the North Victoria
area of Antarctica to collect rock samples from two small islands
called the Terra Novas.
   Despite extensive aerial searches by helicopter and an approach
by the expedition's ship, the islands could not be located, the
report said.
   NZPA said the expedition recommended the islands be removed from
official topographical maps. They were first mapped by an Australian
expedition in 1961, the agency said without giving further details.

   Tibetan resentment toward Chinese rule, largely
muffled since a failed uprising in 1959, has erupted into violence
four times since 1987 in the capital, Lhasa.
   The first clash began when police moved in to arrest leaders of a
small pro-independence march led by 21 Buddhist monks on Sept. 27,
1987.
   On Oct. 1, 1987, Chinese National Day, about 2,000 Tibetans,
angered by the arrests, stormed through the central Barkhor Square,
setting fire to a police station, waving the banned Tibetan flag and
stoning police. The Chinese said six policemen were killed and 19
injured. Tibetan and foreign witnesses put the death toll at 14 and
said hundreds were injured and arrested.
   China blamed the violence on Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, who days before addressed a U.S. Congressional human
rights caucus and called for negotiations on Tibet's status.
   On March 5, 1988, the final day of a major prayer festival, a
monk stood up during ceremonies at the Jokhang Temple and began
shouting for independence. The ensuing violence lasted for two days,
with rioters looting and burning shops and setting fire to vehicles.
   The Chinese said one policemen died when he was stabbed and
pushed by Tibetans from a second-floor window, and more than 300
police were wounded. Unconfirmed reports from foreign travelers put
the death toll at 24.
   On Dec. 10, about 30 Buddhist monks and nuns, some carrying the
Tibetan flag, marched into the central square outside the Jokhang
Temple. They were commemorating the 40th anniversary of the U.N.
Declaration of Human Rights. When crowds surged toward the
protesters and began to throw stones at police, police opened fire,
killing at least one monk and one child.
   On Sunday, a small pro-independence demonstration by monks on the
anniversary of the March 1988 riots touched off widespread violence.
Hundreds of mostly young Tibetans rampaged through the streets,
burning and destroying Chinese-owned buildings and property and
stoning police.
   The violence continued and tapered off until the government
declared martial law in Lhasa on March 7. By official count, 11
people, including one policeman, died on the 5th, and one more
Tibetan was killed the next day. Tibetans said police shot to death
scores of people.

   Hundreds of people who tried to win bit
parts in the film ``Everbody Wins'' are hoping that the title proves
to be apropos.
   People auditioned Monday as extras in the movie, a contemporary
murder mystery written by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Arthur
Miller.
   Hopefuls showed up at the Norwich Sheraton to try their luck at
landing a spot on the silver screen and a stint on the set with
stars Nick Nolte and Debra Winger.
   The casting call, conducted by casting director Todd Thaler,
attracted would-be extras who, despite cold weather, started lining
up more than two hours before the doors opened.
   Once inside, they handed Thaler their pictures, which he glanced
at and dropped in one of six file boxes.
   Dean Festa, an actor who landed a role in ``Mystic Pizza,'' was
pleased because his photo had been placed in box No. 1, labeled
``Judge's Party.
   The other boxes were labeled ``Angela's Street,'' ``Pizzeria,''
``Exterior Courthouse,'' ``Church'' and ``Miscellaneous.'' Thaler's
job was to determine who had the right look for a particular scene,
and he placed the photos in the corresponding boxes.
   Extras selected won't be notified until a day or two before they
are needed for work. Filming is scheduled for later this month.
   Norwich resident Sharron Tarrant, the first in line Monday, said
it was worth it despite the long wait.
   ``It's a chance to live a fantasy,'' she said.

   It's hard calling Marshall E. Grant a
paperboy. He's 80.
   But every morning he hauls 94 copies of the Cumberland Times-News
_ 109 on Sundays _ to residents of Rawlings, about 10 miles
southwest of Cumberland.
   A Rawlings resident, Grant inherited the paper route from his
son, Steve, a 1987 high school graduate now studying electrical
engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.
   Grant, who began by occasionally filling in for his son, said his
customers have been good to him and he does not mind customizing his
deliveries to meet each household's desires.
   ``Some want the paper on the front porch. Some want it on the
back porch,'' Grant said. ``Some want the paper in their mailbox.''
   Grant worked 20 years for the Celanese Corp., a synthetic fiber
plant near Cumberland that closed in 1983, and 30 years for the
Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad before retiring. He has no plans to retire
from his newspaper route.
   ``Some of our friends wonder if I should be outside every day,
but after working for the railroad for 30 years I'm used to it,'' he
said.

   A mayor who was trounced in his bid to
become the state's first black congressman since Reconstruction
praised his Democratic primary opponent, the secretary of state, for
avoiding racial politics.
   ``We did not lose tonight. Alabama won,'' Tuskegee Mayor Johnny
Ford said after being soundly defeated by Secretary of State Glen
Browder in Tuesday's runoff.
   Browder, 46, a former Jacksonville State University professor and
legislator, swept 12 of the 3rd Congressional District's 13 counties
in defeating Ford, who won only in predominantly black Macon County,
where he lives. The rest of the east Alabama district is
three-fourths white.
   With all precincts reporting, Browder had 44,384 votes, or 63
percent, to Ford's 26,257 votes, or 37 percent.
   Browder will now face state Sen. John Rice, who hopes to give the
GOP its first congressional gain in Alabama in a quarter-century.
The special election is scheduled for April 4.
   ``Mayor Ford ran an excellent campaign,'' said Browder. ``He
added class to it. The way he campaigned, the way we campaigned, is
testimony to his career and his future in Alabama politics.''
   Ford, 46, said the Democratic primary, by avoiding virtually any
hint of negative racial politics, ``demonstrated to the nation that
Alabama is on the move.''
   The seat became open with the death Dec. 13 of Bill Nichols, a
Democrat who had represented the eastern Alabama district for 22
years. The district, which includes the university town of Auburn
and the industrial town of Anniston, traditionally has been
Democratic.
   Browder narrowly led Ford in a splintered field of nine
candidates in the first Democratic primary Feb. 14.
   Alabama's last black congressman, Jeremiah Haralson, served from
1875 to 1877.

<HEAD>Friends Say Lottery Winner Died A Happy Man</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three new cars, a used car, three pairs of
shoes, a pair of pants and half a racehorse were about all Jake
Malham had time to buy with $1 million in Florida lottery winnings
before he died of a heart attack.
   Malham, a liquor store and lounge owner who died Monday at age 53
of an apparent heart attack, became the first Georgian to win big
money in Florida's lottery. Friends said Tuesday he died a happy man.
   ``All that money didn't change Jake,'' said R.B. Spriggs, a
friend of Malham's for 30 years. ``It probably relieved him, more
than anything else, of financial pressures.''
   If anything, Spriggs said, the money only made a nice guy nicer.
   After he won the Jan. 12 drawing, he bought new cars for himself,
his mother and his girlfriend, Joann Williamson. Ms. Williamson said
he bought a used car for his brother and the pants and shoes for
himself.
   After that, he was the ``same old Jake,'' she said.
   Malham paid off the debts on his property and gave $1,000 each to
six employees at First State Bank and Trust's branch in Valdosta.
Friends said he had told the employees he'd give them a share if he
ever hit the lottery.
   But Jim Griffin, another longtime friend, said, ``I think the one
thing he was most proud of was that he had paid off everything he
owed.''
   Even after Malham won the Scratch Three lottery contest, he
continued to open his liquor store at 8 a.m. each day, and still
lived in the same mobile home.
   Recently, Malham and Spriggs traveled to Henderson, Ky., to watch
the running of a horse in which they both owned shares. The horse,
Cash Not Silver, won its heat, Spriggs said, and the overjoyed
Malham was showing off his trophy at his liquor store the morning of
his death.
   His body was found in his mobile home that afternoon.
   Spriggs said Malham changed so little that when they traveled
together to the dog races in Jacksonville, Fla., and the horse races
in Tampa, Fla., bills were split 50-50 just as if his pal didn't
have a fortune.
   ``That was fine with me. I didn't want anything from him, and he
knew that,'' Spriggs said.
   Malham had told Spriggs that of the $800,000 he had cleared after
taxes, he had invested about $600,000 of it in high-yield
certificates of deposit, ``so he wasn't blowing this money. He knew
what he was doing.''
   Spriggs and Ms. Williamson said Malham had battled health
problems for much of his life. But they didn't think the excitement
of winning the lottery contributed to his death.
   ``The only time I really worried about his health is when he won
it the lottery. I made him sit down, he was so excited,'' Spriggs
said.

<HEAD>Libya-Controlled Firm Won Defense Work From West Germany, Report
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite warnings from the United
States, the government continued to give sensitive defense contracts
to a Munich company after Libya bought control of the firm, a news
report says.
   Libya bought controlling interest in the Telemit Electronic Co.
in 1979, Norddeutsche Rundfunk's ``Panorama'' television magazine
reported Tuesday.
   It said the company specializes in the development of
sophisticated military intelligence and communications equipment,
including a laser system to measure military target distances.
   The company helped outfit Libya's intelligence network in the
1970s, the report said.
   West Germany's Defense Ministry continued to give military
contracts to Telemit even after it knew that Libya had taken over
majority control of the company, the program alleged.
   The contracts included electronic equipment for West Germany's
Leopard tank, it said.
   The government also allowed the company to deliver sophisticated
electronic gear to both Iran and Iraq during the Persian Gulf war,
Panorama said.
   Panorama said the United States ``expressed its concern over the
West German-Libyan connection'' in the early 1980s. But the
government ignored concerns that Libya could gain access to
sensitive government projects through its association with the
company, the program said.
   It said the company was protected by West German intelligence
agencies, which used it to gain information about developments in
the Middle East.
   Winfried Dunkel, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, told the
program that military contracts have been suspended until the
company is restructured to return it to complete West German control.
   He acknowledged that the company ``is owned by several holding
companies controlled by Libya.''
   Dunkel said the company had been given military contracts for
years, but said none of the contracts involved secret or highly
sensitive technology.
   He said the Defense Ministry in the mid-1980s demanded that the
company ``ensure that no influence could be made by the holding
companies on the firm's management.''
   But he said the recent allegations that West German companies had
been involved in the building of an alleged poison gas factory in
Libya had prompted the ministry to order the contract suspensions.
   The Bonn government was slow in acknowledging and launching
investigations into those allegations, which the U.S. government had
pressed through news media disclosures at the beginning of the year.
   Horst Jungmann, a member of the opposition Social Democratic
Party in federal Parliament, told Panorama of Telemit Electronics:
   ``The government has known for a long time that the company is
100 percent owned by Libya. It has received technical know-how from
the military that could have been sent on to Libya.''

<TEXT>
   Strike-bound Eastern Airlines is rapidly draining
its cash reserves and soon may have to seek bankruptcy protection,
auction off its assets or, most likely, sell itself to the highest
bidder, analysts say.
   The possibility of Eastern filing under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws was heightened Tuesday when the airline said it
couldn't last until the weekend without its 3,600 pilots, most of
whom have refused to cross the picket lines of the striking
Machinists union.
   Eastern is quickly bleeding the $400 million in cash it had on
hand at the beginning of the year, and faces large debt payments
that could force it to seek protection from its creditors, analysts
said.
   ``They're not forced to declare bankruptcy but they can also see
those payments looming in the horizon,'' said Bill Swelbar, director
of industry analysis for Airline Economics Inc.
   The option that analysts see as most likely, however, would be an
outright sale of the 60-year-old carrier. Carl Icahn's Trans World
Airlines already has discussed buying Eastern.
   Analysts place a purchase price anywhere from $400 million plus
debt payments to $900 million for ailing Eastern, which lost $335.4
million last year, nearly double its 1987 loss.
   Analysts doubt that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp., planned to thrust Eastern into bankruptcy
when the Machinists strike began Saturday. Lorenzo used bankruptcy
filing as a way to break the union contracts at Continental Airlines
after Texas Air bought that airline in 1983.
   ``I think the game plan was to force this thing to a showdown and
hopefully get the pilots across the picket line, basically undoing
the Machinists,'' said Louis Marckesano, an analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia.
   But the pilots' decision to honor the strike may have thrown a
wrench into Lorenzo's strategy. A federal judge Tuesday refused to
order the pilots back into the cockpit.
   Most of Eastern's cash _ an estimated $350 million _ represents
money that customers paid in advance for tickets that now must be
refunded or transfered to competitors that honor the tickets. The
money will dwindle within several weeks, according to analysts.
   With limited flights, Eastern, which did about $10 million in
daily business before the strike, has few advance bookings and no
revenue. So it must drain cash reserves to pay wages, overhead and
debt.
   Eastern could get a cash transfusion from the pending $365
million sale of its profitable Northeast shuttle _ one of two
Eastern operations still running _ to New York developer Donald
Trump. Eastern says the strike has not affected the deal, which
awaits final federal approval.
   Repayment of debt associated with the sale and a required pension
fund payment would leave Eastern with about $210 million.
   ``If they don't get the proceeds from the shuttle I would say
they'd have to declare bankruptcy by the end of the month,'' said
Philip Baggaley, an airline bond analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., a major Wall Street credit-rating agency.
   ``If they do, they could probably survive another month or two
and try to sell more operations and more assets,'' he said. ``But
the prospects aren't good no matter what happens.''
   Despite shutting down most of its operations and laying off 9,500
non-union workers this week, analysts estimate Eastern has an
operating cash loss of at least $2 million a day for payments
ranging from leasing airport ticket counters to paying 1,500
remaining employees.
   But should Lorenzo file for protection, he would have a tougher
time abrogating the unions' contracts than he did at Continental. As
a result of 1985 amendments to the bankruptcy laws, Lorenzo first
would have to negotiate further with the Eastern unions and
demonstrate that he had no alternative before firing the workers.
   Another option would be for Eastern to auction its planes,
airport gates, routes and landing rights to other airlines in a
liquidation under Chapter 7 of federal bankruptcy laws.

<TEXT>
   Suspected Tamil separatists killed a
moderate Tamil politician in eastern Sri Lanka today, just one day
before he was to take his seat in Parliament, authorities said.
   In the capital, suspected anti-government radicals burst into a
research laboratory and shot and killed the former vice chancellor
of Colombo University, police said.
   V. Samkpanthamurthy was walking to the rice paddies near his home
in the village of Kakudha when he was gunned down by two men on a
motorcycle, the military said. Kakudha is about 135 miles east of
Colombo.
   The military blamed his killing on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the biggest and most militant Tamil group waging a nearly
6-year-old insurgency for a separate nation.
   Samkpanthamurthy, a leading member of the moderate Tamil United
Liberation Front, was chosen to take one of the 10 Parliament seats
won by the party during the Feb. 15 general election.
   The governing United National Party will control 125 of the 225
seats.
   In the capital, four men burst into the College House across from
Colombo University and fatally shot Professor Stanly Wijesundera,
police said.
   The 65-year-old professor of biochemistry had served as
vice-chancellor of the university for more than 11 years.
Wijesundera retired four months ago and had been working on a
research project, university officials said.
   Police blamed Sinhalese radicals for the killing.
   They said the professor's slaying may have been to protest plans
by President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government to reopen seven
universities that were closed over the last two years because of
student unrest.
   Government officials have said the unrest was fueled by militants
of the ethnic Sinhalese majority, who oppose government efforts to
grant minority Tamils greater autonomy.
   The only university currently operating is in the northern town
of Jaffna.
   The government earlier announced that the seven universities
would reopen on March 2, but postponed the date without giving any
reason.
   The students have been protesting the detention of colleagues who
had opposed an India-sponsored 1987 peace accord aimed at the Tamil
insurgency in the island's north and east provinces.
   Sinhalese radicals said the accord grants too many concessions to
the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people.
   They say they are denied jobs, education and money for
development by the Sinhalese, who are predominantly Buddhist, make
up 75 percent of the population and control the government and
military.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, are a majority in the north and
east, and militant Tamils have been demanding an independent
homeland in those provinces.

   A close associate of four-term socialist
Mayor Bernard Sanders was elected to succeed him, and he promised to
carry on Sanders' ``fight for the rights of ordinary people.''
   Peter Clavelle, 39, Sanders' community development director,
easily defeated Aldermen President Nancy Chioffi, a Democrat, in
Tuesday's election.
   With all precincts reporting, Clavelle drew 5,626 votes, or 53
percent, to Chioffi's 4,400, or 42 percent.
   A ``tax revolt'' candidate and one from the environmentalist
Greens party split the rest of the vote.
   Sanders, the nation's only socialist mayor, had decided to teach
and write rather than serve another two-year term. Clavelle shies
away from the socialist label, but ran under the banner of Sanders'
third-party Progressive Coalition.
   ``What the people have said today is that Progressive government
is good government and they want more of it,'' Clavelle told about
150 supporters. He said he would continue to push most of Sanders'
platform, which includes affordable housing and public access to the
Lake Champlain waterfront.
   He said voters wanted an administration that would continue the
``fight for the rights of ordinary people. It's a fight for the
rights of tenants, it's a fight for housing for the homeless, it's a
fight for decent jobs for everyone in this economy.''
   Sanders, 47, said Clavelle's victory was proof that the
Progressive Coalition wasn't his ``one-man show. It's a movement.
That's what we accomplished tonight.''
   ``There is one city in America that has said we can go beyond
status quo politics, we can talk real issues to the people, we can
have a dream of a city and a state and country that is fundamentally
different than it is now,'' said Sanders, who ran unsuccessfully for
Congress last fall.
   Voters, however, didn't pass two referenda backed by the
coalition that would have set up new taxes to pay for a $1.25
million childcare program.
   Elsewhere around Vermont Tuesday was Town Meeting Day, and
residents braved sub-zero temperatures to travel to their town
halls, approve school budgets and socialize with friends and
neighbors not seen for a year.
   In more than 80 towns, residents voted on a non-binding
resolution asking the Legislature to reinstate the death penalty,
last used in the 1950s. At least 54 towns supported capital
punishment, but nearly 30 rejected or tabled it. One town that voted
down the resolution cited the recent film, ``The Thin Blue Line,''
which suggests that an innocent man faced the death penalty in Texas.
   Two years ago, about 30 towns took up the question, and
two-thirds voted for reinstatement.
   But most town meeting debates were over local issues. Residents
in the central Vermont town of Plainfield applauded their town road
crew, but residents in neighboring Marshfield lost patience when
people couldn't agree on whether to replace an old bridge.
   Pointing a crooked finger at a long-winded neighbor, Russell P.
Goslant said, ``Why keep arguing over a damn old bridge? ... Why
keep arguing over something that don't amount to nothing?''
   When Goslant spoke, at mid-afternoon, the town was averaging an
hour to debate each article on the 27-article warning.

   Known more for fast rhetoric than a fast
break, Gov. Mario Cuomo took off his tie, tied on his sneakers and
defeated Democratic Assemblyman Richard Brodsky in a 30-minute game
of one-on-one basketball.
   Tuesday's game, which Cuomo won 18-12, had symbolic import for
Brodsky, the only announced Democratic candidate in this year's
Westchester County Executive election. The Republican incumbent,
Andrew O'Rourke, challenged Cuomo and lost in the 1986 gubernatorial
race. Beating the guy who beat O'Rourke could have been a good omen
for his campaign.
   But Cuomo, a former minor-league baseball player and avid amateur
basketball player, maintained a lead throughout most of the game and
outpowered the smaller Brodsky in a game played before about 50
people at the State Police Academy gymnasium.
   ``It was a good fight,'' the 5-foot-8, 150-pound Brodsky puffed
after the game.
   The 5-foot-11-inch governor was unusually reticent, saying, ``He
had as many fouls as I had,'' before grabbing the ball and returning
to the court. Brodsky scored about half his points at the foul line.
   In a later game, the governor's team beat the state Assembly's
team, 67-63.

<HEAD>Guns And Explosives Found Near Thatcher Conference Site</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police found guns and plastic explosives hidden in
a forest near a building where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is
to address a Conservative Party conference next week, authorities
said.
   The weapons were found near the northeast England village of
Scalby, about two miles from Scarborough, where the governing
Conservatives are to gather.
   Mrs. Thatcher survived an IRA bomb attack on Oct. 12, 1984 that
killed five people during the Conservatives' annual convention at
the coast resort of Brighton. The blast partly demolished the hotel
in which she was staying.
   North Yorkshire police, who are responsible for the Scarborough
area, said they saw no reason to recommend cancellation of the March
17-18 conference of the Conservatives' national council at
Scarborough's Spa Conference Center.
   The deputy chief constable of North Yorkshire, Frank Morritt,
told a news conference on Tuesday that he could not discount a link
between the arms cache and Mrs. Thatcher's planned visit to
Scarborough.
   Police said the cache of guns, ammunition and Czechoslovak-made
Semtex explosive was found Monday in a forest clearing beside a
road. It was unearthed by accident by a man gathering leaf mold for
his garden, police said.
   Police did not reveal how many weapons were found, but said the
amount of Semtex was substantial. The London newspaper The Daily
Telegraph said 25 pounds of the plastic explosive was found.
   Army bomb disposal experts say Semtex is frequently used in IRA
bombs.
   The British government has repeatedly accused Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Gadhafi of supplying the IRA with arms and Semtex in
retaliation for Mrs. Thatcher's backing of U.S. bombing raids
against Libya in April 1986.
   She gave permission for U.S. warplanes to fly from British bases
to take part in the attack.
   Gadhafi vowed unspecified revenge against Britain shortly after
the raids. He has frequently expressed support for the IRA, which is
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite predominantly
Protestant Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland.
   Morrit on Tuesday called on owners of hotels and guest houses in
the Scarborough area to tell police about any recent visitors who
had given cause for concern.
   Also Tuesday, masked gunmen killed three men at a village gas
station in the Northern Ireland town of Coagh, 50 miles west of
Belfast.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement
to the local news media and said the service station was a
stronghold of the Ulster Volunteer Force, a Protestant paramilitary
group that also is banned.
   Police said the three men slain in Coagh, who were chatting when
the gunment drove up and opened fire, had no connection with
Northern Ireland's security forces.

   Doctors who treated transplant patient Donna
Ashlock, whose story touched millions after she received the heart
of a boy who had a crush on her, were stunned by her death.
   Donna was three weeks from her 18th birthday and was waiting for
a second transplant when she died Tuesday at her home in Patterson.
   Donna, who recently said she wanted to become a nurse, died
during a midday nap, according to San Francisco's Pacific
Presbyterian Medical Center.
   She had received the heart of 15-year-old Felipe Garza Jr. three
years ago at the medical center.
   Although the transplant initially was a success, her body last
year began to reject Felipe's heart, which he willed to his ailing
friend before a blood vessel in his brain burst and he died suddenly.
   Dr. Andrew Fryer, her pediatric cardiologist, said she was in
``pretty good shape'' when doctors examined her last week.
   ``She was a wonderful little girl and her death shocks and
saddens us all,'' Fryer told reporters. ``We truly admired her
resiliency and ability to cope with things that young girls
shouldn't have to cope with.''
   Dr. Michael Schorr, her family physician, and others praised her
cheerfulness, courage and attempts to live the life of a normal
teen-ager during her nearly four-year battle for life.
   ``She had been through a lot of stress and discomfort, physically
and emotionally. She really kept her spirits up remarkably well,''
Schorr said.
   Although there was no official determination of the cause of
death, doctors suspected cardiac arrythmia, the irregular beating of
the heart, a problem often found in transplant patients.
   Her chances would have been excellent with another transplant,
Fryer said.
   Donna's parents declined to talk with reporters.
   Their daughter was thrust into the limelight when it was reported
that Felipe, who once had a crush on his high school classmate, told
his parents he wanted to leave the ailing 14-year-old girl his heart
after his death.
   ``I'm going to die and I'm going to give my heart to my
girlfriend,'' Felipe told his mother in December 1985.
   Felipe, the son of farm laborers, had been suffering from
blackouts and headaches when he talked about donating his heart to
Donna. He died suddenly on Jan. 4, 1986. Donna, whose own heart had
been critically damaged by a virus, received his heart the next day.
   ``I hope that what Peno (Felipe) did shows how people can help
each other,'' Donna said 12 days after the transplant.
   Donna became an instant celebrity. She was featured in People
magazine, visited with President Reagan and accepted an invitation
from rock star Michael Jackson to visit him in his home near Los
Angeles.

<HEAD>Monkey Vaccine May Help In Search For AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have developed a vaccine to
protect monkeys against infection by a virus that is a distant
relative of the AIDS virus, according to a report published today.
   At least three more years of research are needed before the
vaccine can be tested on humans, but scientists say the finding
could help in the search for an AIDS vaccine, the Los Angeles Times
reported.
   ``I think it is going to be a source of great excitement in the
neurological and virological communities,'' said Steven J. Greenberg
of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.
   The vaccine, developed at Ohio State University, protected a
group of macaque monkeys against a virus called HTLV-1, which causes
a rare form of leukemia and has been linked to other diseases.
   HTLV-1 is a member of an unusual family of viruses called
retroviruses, which include the AIDS virus.
   Insights gained in the monkey research may show scientists which
components of the AIDS virus must be present in a vaccine, said Ohio
State pathobiologist Richard G. Olsen.
   The HTLV-1 virus, discovered in the early 1980s by virologist
Robert C. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, causes adult
T-cell leukemia and lymphoma, and has been linked to multiple
sclerosis, systemic lupus, erythematosus and other rare neurological
conditions.
   The virus is spread by the exchange of bodily fluids, in the same
manner as the AIDS virus. Infection by the HTLV-1 virus is endemic
among intravenous drug users in some Eastern urban areas.
   The Olsen group developed the virus by building on information
learned in the successful search for a virus to protect house cats
against infection by a retrovirus that causes feline leukemia, the
No. 1 killer of domestic cats.
   Neither the cat nor monkey vaccines contain the virus itself, but
parts of proteins secreted by animal cells that were infected with
the virus.
   Olsen said that the protein finding was important in AIDS
research because most potential AIDS vaccines being developed only
use one type of protein and thus probably will be less effective.
   ``More than one protein is going to be necessary'' for an AIDS
vaccine, he said.
   Some of Olsen's vaccinated monkeys have gone as long as two years
without showing any traces of infection, but Greenberg and other
scientists note that the HTLV-1 virus can remain hidden for two to
four decades before triggering an infection.
   Olsen, who reported his findings at a recent meeting on
retroviruses, is studying the long-term impact of the vaccine by
using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search for
traces of infection in vaccinated monkeys.

<HEAD>`Run for Your Wife!,' A British Farce, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Run for Your Wife!'' gives American
theatergoers a chance to see an authentic production of a British
sex farce without having to cross the Atlantic.
   Whether they would want to is another question entirely. The
play, which opened Tuesday at Broadway's Virginia Theater, is full
of leers, lunges and lame sex jokes. It could bring back celibacy.
   ``Run for Your Wife!'' stars Ray Cooney, who also wrote and
directed. He strikes out on all three counts. In London's West End,
Cooney is sort of a one-man play industry. His other successful
efforts there include such supposedly spicy concoctions as ``Not
Now, Darling,'' ``Move Over, Mrs. Markham,'' ``Why Not Stay for
Breakfast?'' and ``Two Into One.'' The titles are better than the
plays.
   The plot of ``Run for Your Wife!'' spins out of control early.
John Smith, played by Cooney, is a London taxi cab driver. He has
one wife, Mary, in Wimbledon, and another, Barbara, in Streatham.
Both of their tacky apartments, by set supervisor Michael Anania,
are on stage simultaneously. You can tell them apart because one is
blue, the other yellow. His wives are color-coded to match the
apartments. One wears blue, the other yellow. That's the extent of
their characterizations.
   When Smith saves a little old lady from a mugging and gets beaten
up, his twin living arrangements unravel. Most of the evening is
spent trying to prevent one wife from finding out about the other.
   With one glorious exception, the acting is cardboard _ flat and
gray. Only Paxton Whitehead, as a well-meaning but bumbling
neighbor, manages to rise above the drivel. He actually seems to
believe what he is saying. That's no small accomplishment
considering Cooney's inane dialogue.
   The second act trades boring for offensive. It bashes homosexuals
with some crude jokes, primarily focused on one limp-wristed
character who wears a lavender jumpsuit in case you can't figure out
his sexual preference.
   The play has none of the style or wit of ``Lend Me a Tenor,''
another farce which arrived last week. In fact, it makes that
harmless trifle seem like Noel Coward.
   ```Run for Your Wife!'' is one of London's biggest hits. It has
clocked more than 2,500 performances and shows no sign of slowing
down. In New York, it should expire quickly.
   In other reviews, Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times:
``Accepting the ground rules for allowable contrivances in farce,
the play is still burdened with blind alleys, limp jokes, forced
puns and troubled entendres.''
   ```Run For Your Wife' is what is known in the trade as an
Audience Show,'' wrote Howard Kissel in the Daily News. ``What this
means is that it is so witless and inane that no self-respecting
critic can possibly endorse it, but audiences enjoy it
tremendously.''
   ``The premises of the joke are ramshackle, its convolutions
arbitrary and its conclusion quite remarkably inconclusive,'' wrote
Clive Barnes in the New York Post. ``The results are shabby, with
the actors busting a gut for laughs, rather like a TV sitcom going
down for the third time without a script.''

<HEAD>Lawyer: Award Sets Record For AIDS Suits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who said he contracted AIDS from blood
products during heart surgery in 1985 will collect the largest
settlement for anyone who has contracted the deadly syndrome, his
attorney said.
   Attorney Robert L. Habush said Monday that his client, John
Carroll, avoided an appeals battle over a $3.9 million jury award
because of the settlement.
   The amount was not disclosed, but Habush said it was ``very
favorable and still very much a record in dollars in AIDS cases.''
   The largest previous award is believed to be $1.6 millon for an
Atlanta man who contracted AIDS from a blood product that promotes
clotting. That verdict was later overturned on grounds the evidence
was insufficient to prove negligence by the laboratory that provided
the product.
   A San Francisco jury in December awarded $750,000 to the family
of a 5-year-old who contracted the virus from blood he received
during a heart operation in 1983.
   And in February a California jury awarded Rock Hudson's lover,
Marc Christian, $21.75 million because Hudson failed to tell him he
had AIDS. The case increased the responsibility of AIDS sufferers to
tell sexual companions of their plight.
   Carroll wanted his case resolved quickly so that he could decide
how the money would be used, including what charities he would
support, before he died. The 63-year-old man testified during the
trial that he expected to live no more than one year.
   A Circuit Court jury had awarded the suburban Brookfield man $3.9
million in damages in December, but attorneys said appeals could
have taken years.
   The man had filed suit against the Blood Center of Southeastern
Wisconsin, which provided blood products used during his operation.
   John Dawson, the blood center's lawyer, said the case was settled
to both sides' satisfaction.
   ``The blood center remains confident that it was not negligent
and that there was no liability in this case at all,'' he said.
   The plaintiff argued the center was negligent for distributing
blood products that weren't tested for the AIDS virus even though it
had tested products on hand.
   The blood center's attorneys said that, at the time, they could
not be sure of the reliability of AIDS tests and were reluctant to
replace untested blood with tested blood.
   The plaintiff received the blood April 23, 1985, six weeks after
the blood center began testing blood for the AIDS virus.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, breaks down the
body's immune system and leaves the victim open to outbreaks of
other diseases. No cure is known. It is spread through sexual
contact, transfusions of blood and blood products, and the sharing
of contamined hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers.

<TEXT>
   A storm that deposited snow, ice and
450 stranded motorists on this tiny town overnight, nearly doubling
its population, didn't strain Texas hospitality as residents opened
their homes, churches and cupboards to the beleaguered.
   ``I've never seen an outpouring of kindness like this,'' said
Donny Rohrbach of San Antonio, who like hundreds of others pulled
into Valley View to escape icy roads south of the Oklahoma border
during a massive winter storm.
   He and his mother, Norma, spent Monday night in a pew at the
United Methodist Church here.
   ``These are the loveliest people,'' Mrs. Rohrbach said.
   In less than 12 hours, at least 450 stranded motorists poured
into Valley View, located about 60 miles north of Dallas, to escape
nearly a foot of ice piled on the highway. They packed homes, all
four churches and the high school gymnasium before spilling out into
the town square and nearly every side street to huddle in their
parked rigs and trailers.
   Many of the town's 575 residents offered cots and blankets,
donuts and milk or heartier fare. They opened their homes, ventured
onto a treacherous highway to rescue the stranded, then stayed up
all night to see them fed and sheltered.
   ``Most of these people pass by here all the time and now Valley
View will hold some special memories for them,'' said Melodiee
Blevins, who helped house and feed 125 storm-weary travelers at the
First Baptist Church, where her husband, Jeff, is pastor.
   ``I don't think they'll forget us,'' she said.
   Elsewhere in the nation, others were not so fortunate. Thirty
people have died since the weekend as the huge storm cut a swath
from Oklahoma through Missouri, leaving up to 16 inches of snow
before blowing across the Eastern Seaboard into the ocean.
   Storm warnings have been issued on the North Carolina coastal
waters south of Virginia Beach, and 1 to 2 inches of rain flooded
several roads. Residents of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, kept a wary eye
on the rain-swollen Monongahela River.
   In Arkansas, Gov. Bill Clinton asked federal officials for a
disaster declaration for four northwest Arkansas counties after snow
and ice crushed 280 poultry houses, leaving up to $35 million in
damage and dead birds.
   In all, the storm destroyed as many as 700 poultry houses in a
four-state area, causing what could be the single biggest disaster
ever to hit the poultry industry, said Lynch Butler, president of
Simmons Industries Inc., of Siloam Springs, Ark. Poultry operations
in Oklahoma, Missouri and Kansas also were hit hard.
   As it moved east, the storm knocked out electricity temporarily
to 40,000 customers in Maryland and Delaware, and thousands more in
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   In Valley View, however, the worst was over today, although an
icy slush on Interstate 35 continued to cause traffic slowdowns near
the Texas-Oklahoma border.
   ``It's kind of a let down after Monday night,'' Ms. Blevins said.
``It added a lot of excitement to a small town.''

   Former Mayor John V. Lindsay, who underwent heart
surgery a year ago, was hospitalized again for tests.
   Lindsay, 67, was in stable condition this morning in the coronary
intensive-care unit of New York Hospital, where he was admitted
Monday, said Barry Kreisberg, a hospital administrator.
   He declined further comment other than to say Lindsay was
undergoing tests.
   Lindsay underwent a 4{-hour operation at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center on Jan. 27 to repair a leaky heart valve.
   He represented Manhattan's ``Silk Stocking'' 17th Congressional
District from 1959 until he was elected mayor in 1965 on a
Republican-Liberal ticket. He won his second term as an independent
and later switched to the Democratic Party.
   Lindsay practices law in Manhattan at the firm of Webster and

<HEAD>Guilty Verdict in `Ski Mask Rapist' Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man convicted of being the ``ski mask
rapist'' in the sexual assaults of 26 women is virtually assured of
spending the rest of his life in prison, a prosecutor said.
   Anthony Sanchez, a 27-year-old former city sewer worker, was
found guilty Tuesday of 117 of 136 charges stemming from the
assaults.
   ``If I just look at the violent sexual offenses, I can see that
he's looking at more than 500 years in prison,'' prosecutor Margo
Smith said. Disregarding appeals, Sanchez would have to serve at
least half his sentence before being eligible for parole.
   ``We have a number of victims here who were greatly traumatized.
There can be no doubt justice has been done,'' Smith said.
   Superior Court Judge Paul R. Teilh set sentencing for April 25.
   Teilh said he had carefully reviewed preliminary hearing
transcripts and found no doubt that Sanchez was guilty of most of
the counts filed against him.
   Sanchez agreed Friday to let the judge declare a verdict based on
the transcripts, which included testimony from the victims. Teilh
dismissed 19 charges.
   Police reports said Sanchez usually stalked his victims before
accosting them and often tied them up, sexually assaulting them,
then taking cash, jewelry or automatic bank-teller cards. The rapes
occurred in both homes and offices and one woman was attacked in a
church confessional.
   The assailant usually wore a ski mask and often threatened his
victims with a knife or pellet gun that closely resembled a
.45-caliber pistol.
   ``I've killed before, and I'll kill again,'' he warned them,
according to the police reports.
   When Sanchez was arrested Dec. 16, 1987, police discovered a ski
mask, a black pellet gun and a hooded sweat shirt in his car.
Several victims said their assailant had worn such a mask and shirt.
   The charges against Sanchez involved attacks from 1985 to 1987 on
Santa Clara County women ranging in age from 16 to 84.
   Teilh found Sanchez guilty on 22 counts each of rape, burglary,
and robbery.
   He also found Sanchez guilty of 23 oral copulation charges, six
assaults with intent to commit rape, 17 sexual batteries, four
instances of sodomy and one count of penetration with a foreign
object.

<HEAD>Conservative Group Moving To Sen. McCarthy's Hometown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>APPLETON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The John Birch Society plans to move its
headquarters to this northeastern Wisconsin town, but Mayor Dorothy
Johnson said she doubts it will give the community an image problem.
   Appleton already is known for its links to the late Sen. Joseph
McCarthy _ annual memorial services are held at his gravesite in
town and a large bust of him is in the Outagamie County Courthouse.
The town also holds the annual Harry Houdini seance, in honor of the
famed magician who grew up in town.
   ``That says our city has a variety of ideas, and isn't it
wonderful we can permit within our social network the whole range of
ideas,'' Ms. Johnson said.
   The conservative organization will close its headquarters in
Belmont, Mass., and San Marino, Calif., and consolidate operations
in Appleton beginning in July, the group said in the March issue of
the John Birch Society Bulletin.
   ``It's a real opportunity here in terms of potential growth and
the economic impact of it all,'' said G. Allen Bubolz, an Appleton
insurance executive who became the society's chief executive officer
in November.
   The headquarters will start with a staff of 27 people and a
payroll of roughly $1 million, Bubolz said.
   The society said Appleton also was nearer the geographical center
of the United States and noted its connections to McCarthy, the
Republican senator who chaired hearings into alleged communist
activities in the United States in the 1950s. McCarthy, who was
later censured by his colleagues, was born in nearby Grand Chute.
   The society is a conservative political organization that
emphasizes fighting the spread of communism and reducing the size of
U.S. government. It claims more than 10,000 members.
   City Attorney Greg Carman didn't share the mayor's views, saying
the move was unfortunate for the community. But he said he would not
advocate any attempt to prevent it.
   Carman said he feared that the McCarthy bust, the annual services
for McCarthy and the Birch Society would present a false image of
the people of Appleton.

<TEXT>
   Rain and snow dampened the Eastern Seaboard from Florida to
Maryland early today and cold northwest winds created snow drifts up
to six feet deep in Minnesota.
   A mixture of rain, sleet and snow extended from Maryland to South
Carolina, while light rain was falling in southeastern Georgia and
the Florida Peninsula.
   A winter storm warning was in effect this morning for the
northern coast and midlands of South Carolina, and extended to this
evening for central and northern coastal areas of North Carolina.
   A gale warning was in effect for the coastal areas of Virginia
and North Carolina, with a coastal flood warning posted for the
Outer Banks of North Carolina.
   A cold front along the nation's northern tier was bringing
freezing rain to northeastern North Dakota. An advisory for freezing
rain and blowing snow was in effect for northwestern Minnesota,
where some highways were buried under 6-foot snowdrifts.
   A storm was bringing showers to northern and central California
and producing snow at higher elevations in the Sierra Nevada range
and in the Lake Tahoe area of Nevada.
   Clear skies in the Great Lakes and the Northeast allowed
temperatures to plunge. Early morning temperatures were mainly in
single digits and the teens, with subzero readings in northern
Michigan, upstate New York and northern New England.
   Today's forecast called for rain in South Carolina, northeast
Georgia and southern Florida. Snow was predicted for much of North
Carolina into south central and eastern Virginia. Rain also was
forecast to extend from the central and northern Pacific Coast to
western portions of Montana and Wyoming and northwest Utah.
   Highs were expected to be in the 20s from the northern Great
Lakes to New England; the 30s from the upper Mississippi Valley
through the Ohio Valley to the Middle Atlantic states; the 60s and
70s from the southern half of California through the Four Corners
region to the central and southern Plains and the Texas Gulf Coast,
and in southern Florida; and the 80s to around 90 degrees in Arizona
and southern Nevada. Highs were forecast to be in the 40s and 50s
elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 9 degrees below zero at
Plattsburgh, N.Y., to 68 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Army Closes Proposed Settlement, Evicts Settlers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The army shut down an illegal
Jewish settlement today, turning out a small group of Israelis who
pitched a tent on the hilltop site in an attempt to launch a new
community.
   The bid to create another Jewish enclave in the West Bank
followed a rally attended by 10,000 people in Tel Aviv whose
organizers called for the founding of eight such settlements.
   Elswhere in the occupied lands today, Palestinians staged a
general strike to mark the 15-month anniversary of their uprising.
   Seven Arabs were shot and wounded during clashes with troops in
the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was
checking the reports.
   Palestinian women staged pro-PLO demonstrations in the West Bank
town of Beit Jalla and in Gaza City to mark International Women's
Day.
   The latest leaflet issued by underground leaders of the uprising
against Israel's 21-year occupation praised women for their ``heroic
role ... in the liberation war.''
   In east Jerusalem, police imposed a curfew on the Arab Isawiye
section and rounded up men suspected of involvement in recent
protests, police said. At least 15 Palestinians were arrested,
Israel radio said.
   After Tuesday night's rally in Tel Aviv, a group of would-be
settlers set out for the site of a proposed settlement called
Ofarim. The site is about 15 miles east of Tel Aviv on land occupied
by Israel since it was captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
war.
   The government's coalition agreement calls for setting up eight
settlements, but final approval has not been granted.
   The Finance Ministry, controlled by the left-center Labor Party,
says the country cannot afford the new settlements.
   Two army jeeps blocked the entrance to the Ofarim site this
morning.
   A Defense Ministry official who demanded anonymity said eight
activists from the right-wing Betar youth movement had set up a tent
at the site during the night but later left at the order of soldiers.
   ``It was a symbolic takeover of the land. When the army came,
they left voluntarily,'' said Yaakov Narodetsky, general secretary
of Bet Aryeh, a settlement about one mile from the Ofarim site.
   Other hopeful settlers last night drove three large mobile homes
out to another Jewish community, Beit Horon, and said they planned
to move out to the proposed new settlement of Talmon later in the
week.
   More than 70,000 Jewish settlers coexist uneasily with 1.7
million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
maintaining more than 130 settlements. Many are dedicated to
continuing Israel's control of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Settlers have called for moving even more Jews out to the
territories to strengthen Israel's hold on the land.
   Elyakim Haetzni, an activist in the settlement movement, said on
Israel's state-run radio station this morning that the settlers
would oppose any peace settlement that called for Israel's
withdrawal from the territories.
   ``The state of Israel cannot turn Jews out of the state of
Israel,'' Haetzni said.
   Palestinians throughout the occupied territories began a general
strike to mark the 15th month of the revolt that began Dec. 8, 1987.
At least 391 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed in the
uprising.

<HEAD>Jewish Women Begin Hunger Strikes to Protest Emigration Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 50 Jewish women across the Soviet Union
began a three-day hunger strike today to protest what they say are
arbitrary policies that bar their emigration, a participant said.
   It is the third year in a row that Jewish Women Against Refusal,
whose members have been denied exit visas, have held a hunger strike
beginning on International Women's Day, a Soviet holiday celebrated
on March 8.
   ``These three hunger strikes have all been during the years of
perestroika. Everyone talks a lot about all the changes due to
perestroika, but the situation in emigration is still the same,''
said hunger strike organizer Inna Ioffe, who first applied for an
exit visa 10 years ago. Perestroika is what President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev calls his reform program.
   The women are protesting Soviet emigration procedures and calling
on Soviet leaders to set up a judicial system to review their cases.
   About half of the 46 women participating in the hunger strike
have been refused emigration for reasons of state secrecy, Ioffe
said. Soviet authorities have told them they cannot leave because
they or their relatives have knowledge of state secrets, she said.
   The other half have been denied emigration because their parents
or divorced spouses have failed to certify that they have no
financial claims on the would-be emigrants, she said.
   Women in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Vilnius, Irkutsk and
other cities were participating in the hunger strike, Ioffe said.
   ``We have no laws to lean on, and we are never given reasonable
reasons for the refusals,'' she said.
   Ioffe said she has been told she cannot emigrate because her
76-year-old mother-in-law, who also wants to emigrate, was exposed
to state secrets in her work as a botanist.
   More than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to emigrate
in 1988.
   Yuri Semenovsky, who has sought in vain for three years to obtain
a Soviet exit visa, said at a recent Moscow demonstration of the
so-called Jewish refuseniks that 80,000 others have had applications
refused.
   The majority of the women who participated in the 1988 and 1987
hunger strikes have now emigrated, said Ioffe, who also took part in
those hunger strikes.

<HEAD>Izvestia Says Soviet AIDS Cases Rising Fast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS is spreading at an alarming rate in the Soviet
Union, with the number of infected or ill people forecast to
increase nearly tenfold next year, the government daily Izvestia
says.
   The newspaper quoted the health minister, Yevgeny Chazov, as
saying AIDS now poses no less a danger to the Soviet Union than
nuclear weapons.
   ``The alarming situation with AIDS demands rapid and decisive
measures,'' Izvestia said Tuesday night in the latest of a series of
reports in the Soviet press expressing growing concern about the
deadly disease.
   The Soviets once claimed acquired immune deficiency syndrome was
strictly a Western problem caused by decadent capitalist sexual
mores and drug use. Homosexuals and intravenous drug users are two
of the groups at greatest risk.
   Soviet papers once even claimed AIDS was the result of a Pentagon
experiment in biological warfare.
   Soviet scientists since have debunked such claims, saying their
country needs to mobilize more resources to fight the spread of the
disease, which saps the body's natural defenses and leaves it open
to onslaught by other ailments.
   According to Izvestia, however, the AIDS virus is spreading at an
alarming rate among Soviets.
   In 1988, the paper said, 81 people in the Soviet Union were
carriers of the AIDS virus. By Feb. 1, it said, 44 more cases were
known and now the total number of people infected with the virus is
more than 140.
   ``It's expected that next year, there will be 1,342 sick
people,'' Izvestia said, apparently referring to carriers of the
virus, rather than people actually suffering symptoms.
   Of four Soviets actually suffering AIDS symptoms, three have died
to date, Izvestia said.
   The government newspaper, reporting on a meeting of a special
Soviet commission created to fight epidemics, quoted Chazov as
saying warnings to the Kremlin that AIDS could become a national
calamity had been ignored.
   ``The threat that we face is no less than the ecological `bomb'
or nuclear weapons,'' Izvestia quoted Chazov as saying.
   ``He also stated that workers of the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health
on numerous occasions tried to inform the government that the
situation was menacing. But noted scientists dealing with the
problem eliminated the acuteness of the question, saying it was all
a false alarm.''
   The United States had 86,157 AIDS victims as of last month,
according to the World Health Organization.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. George MacLeod, an innovative Scottish
churchman, and West German physicist Carl Freidrich von Weizsaecker
today were named winners of the 1989 Templeton Prize for Progress in
Religion.
   The prize, amounting this year to $435,000, is the world's
biggest and is deliberately kept larger than Nobel prizes in the
sciences and literature.
   This is the first time in the award's 16 years that it has been
divided between two winners, a result of rankings by an
international panel of judges, a spokesman said.
   MacLeod, 92, of Edinburgh, was chosen for his founding of the
famed Iona Community, an ecumenical center of prayer, peacemaking
and work that has influenced church life in many countries.
   Weizsaecker, 76, of Munich, was named for initiating dialogue
between the disciplines of science and religion and for research
into links between physics, cosmology and theology.
   MacLeod said in a statement he would use half of the money for
direct action against hunger and the other half for work for peace.
   Weizsaecker, a Protestant layman and the brother of West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker, said his share would go to
deepening relationships between science and faith.
   The winners were announced at a news conference at the Church
Center for the United Nations by John Templeton, American investment
counselor and financier, who founded the prize in 1972.
   He said its purpose is to encourage inter-religious understanding
and to help ``people in all nations to grow spiritually in their
love of God and understanding of God.''
   Previous winners have included the Roman Catholic nun Mother
Teresa of Calcutta, India; U.S. evangelist Billy Graham and the
Russian-expatriate writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
   Weizsaecker is the second scientist to win the prize. The Rev.
Stanley L. Jaki, an astrophysicist at Seton Hall University in New
Jersey, won two years ago.
   Choice of last year's winner, Inamullah Khan of Pakistan,
secretary-general of the World Moslem Congress, was temporarily
delayed after some Jewish leaders alleged he had links to
anti-Semitism.
   But the award subsequently was made after an inquiry found the
criticisms unjustified.
   The nine judges for the competition this year included former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon, Roman Catholic Archishop Mark
McGrath of Panama, and British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   MacLeod, a Church of Scotland clergyman, left a wealthy parish to
minister to shipbuilding workers and their families in Glasgow. In
1938, he founded the ecumenical community on the isle of Iona off
Scotland's west coast.
   With its simple monastic-style commitment to a fivefold rule of
daily prayer and Scripture study, tithing, peacemaking, and
responsible work, the community has drawn interest of Christians
around the world.
   About 100,000 visit there annually to experience its methods
first-hand as a model for religious renewal, peace and Christian
unity.
   MacLeod, who had become a pacifist after witnessing the slaughter
of World War I as a military captain, also founded an early peace
organization, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, which now has
branches in most countries.
   He stepped down in 1967 as leader of the Iona Community, which
has about 200 resident members and thousands of supporter elsewhere.
Elevated to the British House of Lords, he continues a broad
schedule of teaching.
   Weizsaecker was cited as pioneering ``the development of the
inter-relationships of physics, cosmology and theology'' and laying
``the groundwork for the renewal of faith.''
   An astrophysicist, his research into cosmology led him after
World War II to initiate conversations between scientists and
theologians, originally in 1949 at the University of Gottingen in
Germany, and later elsewhere.
   Such conversations spread to other countries in Europe and
America, resulting in an international conference in 1978 on science
and faith sponsored by the World Council of Churches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Weizsaecker, who has written about 40 books on physics,
astronomy, cosmology and religion, has taught at universities of
Berlin, Stasbourg, Gottingen, Hamburg and Munich.
   He recently retired as director of the Max Planck Institute in
Starnberg, a position he held since 1970.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens has pleaded
innocent on a misdemeanor charge accusing him of having sex with a
teen-age girl.
   Thomas Tyack, one of two attorneys representing Lukens, R-Ohio,
entered the plea Tuesday in Franklin County Juvenile Court. Tyack
also requested a jury trial before Judge Ronald Solove.
   No date has been set for the trial.
   A grand jury on Feb. 23 indicted Lukens on a charge of
contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a child. The
charge alleges that Lukens had sex with a 16-year-old girl last
November.
   Lukens has denied the charge and said he was the victim of a
``setup'' by the girl, who he said was seeking money.
   The indictment came after a television station broadcast a
secretly recorded videotape in which the girl's mother asked Lukens
why he was ``messin' around'' with her teen-age daughter. Lukens
replied that he did not know the girl was a teen-ager, the station
said.

<HEAD>Court Says Spectators Can Take Notes in American's Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that spectators may
take notes during most trials, and an American lawyer who brought
the case said the decision would help open the Japanese legal system
to needed reform.
   Until today's ruling, only reporters for major newspapers and
radio and television stations were allowed to take notes during most
trials.
   The decision came in a case brought by Lawrence Repeta, a Seattle
attorney denied permission to take notes at a tax trial in 1983-84.
Although it ruled in his favor, the court said Repeta's inability to
take notes during the trial was not serious enough to warrant paying
the $10,000 damages he demanded.
   While attending the tax trial as part of research for a book on
Japanese law, Repeta, 38, was repeatedly refused permission to take
notes. With support from the Japanese Civil Liberties Union, he
lodged a complaint, which was rejected by Tokyo District Court and
Tokyo High Court.
   ``As of today, anyone can go into any courtroom in Japan and will
be allowed to take notes,'' Repeta said today.
   ``In a democracy, people have to have free access to the courts,
or they can't be satisfied that the criminal process is being used
fairly.''
   Repeta told reporters there were ``very serious violations of
fundamental human rights principles'' in Japanese criminal trials,
including the holding of suspects for long periods without bail and
without access to a lawyer. In the tax case, Repeta observed, the
defendant was held for 2{ years without bail.
   ``The best remedy for such problems is public knowledge of what
goes on in the courtroom,'' he said.
   In a rare appearance by a foreigner before the Supreme Court,
Repeta told the judges in a January hearing that Japan now has a
responsibility to set an international legal example.
   ``The world looks to Japan to take a leadership role, not only in
economics but also in the cultural and political fields,'' he said.
   About 30 Japanese supported Repeta in the case, including
lawyers, reporters and writers.
   His Japanese lawyer, Yoichi Kitamura, said it took an American to
bring the case ``because Japanese are accustomed to the fact that
spectators are not allowed to take notes.''
   In Japan's controversial ``press club'' system, most government
agencies maintain semi-official press clubs that generally exclude
reporters from small newspapers and magazines, and foreign
correspondents.
   Until today's ruling, only members of judiciary press clubs were
allowed to take notes during most trials. Members of press clubs
still do not have access to court documents.

   Foreigners were given a day to leave the remote southern city.
   An Australian traveler told of security forces in Lhasa pulling
Tibetans out of their homes: ``One or two people were screaming
really frantically as they were being taken away into a truck.
   ``The truck kept coming back,'' he said. ``They would pick up a
couple people, drive off with a half dozen militia holding them
down, then come back.''
   The Australian, speaking by telephone, said he saw police leading
away another group of 12 to 14 youths, some of whom looked as young
as nine.
   An American tourist said thousands of soldiers occupied the old
section of the city, where Tibetans protesting Chinese rule began
rioting Sunday, stoning police and building bonfires of goods looted
from Chinese-owned stores.
   Official reports have put the death toll in the violence at 12,
although Tibetans say far more have been killed, most shot to death
by security frces.
   At midnight Tuesday, trucks with loudspeakers began announcing
the city was under martial law and that Tibetans should stay indoors.
   Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers later entered the city.
   Chinese authorities said the entire city would be ``cordoned
off.'' Anyone ``who defies martial law or instigates others to do so
will be severely punished,'' the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
   It was the first time China has publicly imposed martial law
anywhere since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. It marked an
escalation in the battle with Tibetan protesters, who demand freedom
from China and the return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama,
who fled to exile in India after a filed uprising 30 years ago.
   In New Delhi, the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile today offered
to hold talks in Geneva with Chinese authorities to discuss Tibet's
future.
   ``Despite the current tragic events, we are still ready to hold
talks with the Chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found,''
said Tashi Wongdi, the Tibetan leader's chief representative in New
Delhi.
   The two sides have agreed to meet to discuss the Tibetan
situation but have been unable to agree on a location. China also
refuses to discuss the Dalai Lama's proposal for greater autonomy
for Tibet.
   Troops were not deployed in three previous outbreaks of violence
over the past 18 months that claimed the lives of about 40 Tibetans
and police.
   One American said that after martial law was declared, ``The
Tibetans who'd been marching around were still angry. They felt
frustrated. Others were scared. I saw grown men bursting into
tears.''
   Doje Cering, head of the Tibet Autonomous Government, was quoted
on national radio today as saying separatists had taken China's
restrained stance toward past demonstrations as a sign of weakness.
   ``Now is the time for a radical solution. If we don't adopt that
now, it will seriously influence our social stability.''
   Travelers said police entered one hotel at 2:30 a.m. and another
an hour later and announced that all foreigners must leave Lhasa by
noon Thursday. About 80 foreigners were believed to be in the city.
   ``It's basically a choice between heading for the Nepal border
and flying to Chengdu,'' the provincial capital of Sichuan, one
traveler said. ``But they won't let us out to go to the bank or
prepare.''
   One American traveler said most of the Tibetans wounded in the
clashes have been hiding in their homes. ``It's presumed that
anybody who got shot must be guilty,'' he said.
   Foreigners said security forces were checking identifications of
both the few Tibetans and Chinese out on the streets. There were no
reports of demonstrations or gunfire today.
   All foreigners spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of
reprisal.
   Three Swedes who took photographs of Sunday's initial clash in
the central square were given back their cameras and passports
Tuesday after paying fines of about $54 each. An American who took
more pictures was fined the equivalent of $135, a fellow American
said.
   However, one Swiss who refused to turn over his film Sunday said
police beat him and pointed a gun at his head. He said police still
have his camera and passport and say they will not return them until
he hands over the film and pays a fine. He said he was not injured.
   China has not said how long martial law will be in effect,
although it is certain to last through Friday, the 30th anniversary
of a failed uprising in 1959 that led to the Dalai Lama's exile.

<HEAD>Chinese Reportedly Helping Build Iranian Missile Factory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iran, with help from China, is building a
plant to produce surface-to-surface missiles with a range of more
than 500 miles, Western diplomatic sources said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said Iran
continues to develop materials to conduct chemical warfare.
   They said the missile factory is in northeastern Iran, but they
did not give the precise location. ``It's a missile plant and the
Chinese are lending support to build it. That much is known,'' one
source said.
   Surface-to-surface missiles are used against land targets such as
military installations and population centers.
   Although Iran and China deny any arms deals, U.S. and other
Western officials say China has been a principal supplier of weapons
for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.
   The sales, estimated by these experts at more than $1 billion,
have included two types of jet aircraft and the HY-2 Silkworm and
C-801 anti-ship missiles, which have a range of less than 100 miles.
   China's deputy prime minister, Tian Jiyun, ended a five-day trip
to Iran on Tuesday, according to Tehran television, monitored in
Cyprus. It said the visit concentrated on trade and industrial ties,
and made no mention of weapons.
   Iran said a year ago it was building its own version of a
``foreign missile'' for use against Iraq. A U.N.-mediated cease-fire
on Aug. 20 halted the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
   Iran has not given details on the missile it is building, but
Western experts have said it would be relatively simple for the
Iranians to have copied Soviet-designed ``Scud-B'' rockets acquired
from Syria or Libya.
   China's arsenal does not include a surface-to-surface missile
with a 500- to 600-mile range, according to the authoritative
reference Jane's Weapons Systems. However, the Soviet Union has
produced a series of mobile, land-based missiles including the SS-12
and its successor, the SS-22, each with a range of about 540 miles.
The Soviets also are replacing the Scud-B with the SS-23, a 300-mile
range missile.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, the nations periodically bombarded each
others' population centers, a practice that became known as the
``war of the cities.''
   Baghdad, Iraq's capital, is only 60 miles from the border and
originally gave Iran a strong advantage. But the ``war of the
cities'' reached unprecedented intensity last year when Iraq began
using long-range missiles to batter Tehran and other areas of Iran
previously beyond range.
   Some analysts have said Iraq's use of the missiles, Soviet
Scud-Bs with so-called ``strap-on'' boosters to increase their
160-mile range, was a key factor in forcing Iran to agree to the
cease-fire.
   The diplomatic sources said Iraq and Iran were known to be
continuing the development of chemical weapons.
   Iraq admitted to the use of poison gas against Iranian forces and
Kurdish rebels during the war, and a United Nations report in April
said there was evidence that Iran also had used gas.
   Iran says it has the ability to manufacture chemical weapons but
that it has neither produced nor used them in the war.

<HEAD>School Board Bans Apple Sales Over Pesticide Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Students may still bring apples for their
favorite teachers, but they won't be able to buy them in the school
cafeteria, officials have decided in reaction to reports of possible
health risks.
   The Board of Education, which feeds students in 1,200 public and
parochial schools, has barred the sale of apples in lunchrooms over
fears that they are treated with a cancer-causing pesticide, New
York Newsday reported today.
   ``We have conflicting information,'' a high-ranking board
official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Newsday. ``The apple
processors say they don't use (the pesticide) Alar. The media says
they do.
   ``In the meantime, to maintain a high confidence level, we took
them off the market,'' the official said. Apple juice and sauce,
however, are still being served.
   Last year, 13 million apples were sold or distributed to public
and parochial school students in New York City.
   The Washington-based National Resources Defense Council last week
reported that the pesticide diaminozide, which is sold under the
brand name Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children
who drink a lot of apple juice.
   Apple growers have reacted angrily, saying only about 4 percent
of all apples sold in the United States show any traces of Alar and
those amounts are well below levels permitted by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Alar is used to maintain firmness and resist bruising in fruits
and vegetables.

<TEXT>
   Tibetan resentment toward Chinese rule, largely
muffled since a failed uprising in 1959, has erupted in violence
four times since 1987 in the capital of Lhasa. Here is a chronology
of the incidents:
   Sept. 27, 1987 _ Police move in to arrest leaders of a small
pro-independence march led by 21 Buddhist monks.
   Oct. 1, 1987 _ Chinese National Day. About 2,000 Tibetans,
angered by the arrests, storm Lhasa's central Barkhor Square,
setting fire to a police station, waving the banned Tibetan flag and
stoning police. Chinese officials say six died and 19 were injured.
Tibetans and foreign witnesses put the death toll at 14 and say
hundreds were injured and arrested.
   March 5, 1988 _ Two days of violence begin on the final day of a
major prayer festival, when a monk stands up during ceremonies at
Jokhang Temple and begins shouting for independence. Rioters loot
and burn shops and set fire to vehicles. Chinese officials say one
policeman died when Tibetans stabbed him and pushed from a window
and another 300 were injured.
   Unconfirmed reports from foreign travelers put the death toll at
24.
   Dec. 10, 1988 _ About 30 Buddhist monks and nuns, some carrying
the Tibetan flag, march into the central square outside Jokhang
Temple to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration
on Human Rights. Crowds surge toward the marchers and begin throwing
stones at police, who open fire and kill at least one monk and a
child.
   March 5, 1989 _ A small pro-independence demonstration by monks
on the anniversary of the March 1988 riots touches off widespread
violence, with hundreds of mostly young Tibetans rampaging through
the streets, burning and destroying Chinese-owned buildings and
property and stoning police.
   March 7, 1989 _ The government declares martial law in Lhasa and
puts the death toll from the latest violence at 12, including one
policeman. Tibetans say police shot scores of people to death.

   Fire swept through a five-story apartment
building in this eastern city today, killing 11 people and injuring
eight, fire officials said.
   An undetermined number of people were missing, said a fire
department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The fire broke out about 3:30 a.m., and 80 firefighters brought
it under control about two hours later, he said.
   He said the fire started in a third-floor stairway but that the
cause had not been determined.
   Four people died of injuries suffered when they jumped out of
windows on the upper floors of the old building, located near the
local university, the official said.
   Four bodies were found in the ravaged building soon after the
fire was extinguished, and three more were found later by fire
investigators.
   The fire official said five residents of the building and three
firefighters were injured.

Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Victims of the Bhopal gas disaster
ransacked the office of Union Carbide Corp. today, as the Supreme
Court began hearing arguments challenging the government's authority
to settle their compensation.
   ``Killer Carbide Quit India!'' screamed about 140 demonstrators
who formed a human chain around the multinational company's office
in central New Delhi, while a dozen stormed into the reception area.
   They broke windows, smashed furniture and scribbled slogans on
the walls of the reception area, according to company spokesman
Subramanium Kumaraswamy.
   ``We Will Not Allow UCC To Get Away With Murder!'' protesters
outside yelled. Nobody was injured in the melee, which lasted 20
minutes, Kumaraswamy said. The Danbury, Conn.-based multinational
asked for police protection.
   The protesters were among about 800 victims who came to New Delhi
from the central town of Bhopal to demand the Supreme Court scrap
its Feb. 14 order that Union Carbide pay $470 million as ``full and
final'' settlement to victims of the 1984 accident. India's
government agreed to the settlement after originally suing for $3
billion.
   It was the world's worst industrial accident, killing at least
3,400 people and injuring more than 20,000. Four years later, people
still are dying from effects of the gas leak at the pesticide plant.
   Police and paramilitary troops searched those entering the court,
whose main gates were locked against 800 demonstrators squatting in
the road.
   Inside, the court heard the petition of C.L. Sahu, a victim
challenging the government's right to pass the Bhopal Gas Leak
Disaster Act 1985, which made it the sole representative of all gas
victims.
   Sahu's attorney, R.K. Garg, said the act denied fundamental
rights to life and livelihood guaranteed by India's Constitution. It
``challenged the concept of India as a free nation,'' Garg argued.
He said the government erred in failing to hold Union Carbide liable
for the disaster.
   Chief Justice Raghunandan S. Pathak last week appointed five
judges to hear the case. They were chosen after Judge E.S.
Venkataramiah, one of five judges who ordered the Feb. 14
settlement, quit the panel because of widespread criticism of the
agreement.
   Opposition politicians, newspapers, prominent citizens and gas
victims say the government settled for too little.
   Union Carbide deposited the entire amount with the court on Feb.
24. It is being held while judges decide whether to admit petitions
challenging the order. About 570,000 people filed claims with the
government that they were affected by the lethal leak of methyl
isocyanate on Dec. 3, 1984.
   ``If the court has any respect for the voice of the people, it
will change,'' said one of the demonstrators, Abdul Jabbar Khan of
the Bhopal Gas Victims Women's Industrial Organization.
   The hearings continue Thursday. Judges must decide whether they
will admit the petition for review of the court's judgment, which
absolved Union Carbide of all liability, civil and criminal.
   Union Carbide says the accident was sabotage by a disgruntled
employee. The government says it was caused by negligence.

<TEXT>
   Gospel-country singer Stuart Hamblen,
who wrote inspirational songs and once ran for president as a
Prohibition Party candidate after swearing off booze and horse
racing, died today. He was 80.
   Hamblen, who lapsed into a coma after surgery Feb. 28 to remove a
malignant brain tumor, died at 3 a.m., said Armen Markarian,
spokesman for St. John's Hospital and Health Center.
   Hamblen also had been suffering from inoperable lung cancer, said
another hospital spokesman, Garth Hintz.
   Hamblen was host of ``The Cowboy Church'' radio show in Los
Angeles, which is still heard in reruns around the country.
   He was best known for his 1950s spiritual tunes, ``It Is No
Secret What God Can Do'' and ``This Old House.'' He also recorded
``Open Up Your Heart (And Let the Sun Shine In)'' ``Remember Me, I'm
the One Who Loves You'' and ``Texas Plains.''
   The former hard drinker and hillbilly singer led a colorful life
that started out in Kellysville, Texas, where his father was a
Methodist preacher.
   After winning an amateur talent contest, he left Texas and signed
recording contracts. He also appeared on television and performed
concerts nationwide.
   He loved horse racing and owned one of the leading race horse
stables in the West, and admitted he was an alcoholic who once ran
up a $250 bar tab in Hollywood in the 1950s.
   His life changed one night when he visited a tent revival
conducted by evangelist Billy Graham. His conversion was immediate
and Hamblen gave up drinking and race horses.
   In 1952, Hamblen became the Prohibition Party's nominee for
president in an election won by Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   In recent years, the retired Hamblen and his wife of 51 years,
Suzy, raised rare Peruvian Paso horses at their ranch in Canyon
Country.
   During his illness, Hamblen received calls from Graham, former
President Reagan, and country stars Roy Rogers, Dale Evans and Gene
Autry, as well as fans nationwide.
   Hamblen is survived by his wife and three daughters, Lisa
Jaserie, Viva Pressnel and Kim Hamblen.

<TEXT>
   A pro-Iranian militant group holding two
American hostages said today it has completed plans to kill British
author Salman Rushdie for allegedly defaming Islam in his novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization warned in a statement
delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut that ``the execution''
will be preceeded by attacks on British police. It did not threaten
the hostages.
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization declares that it has
completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued by
esteemed cleric and great struggler Ayatollah Khomeini against
Salman Rushdie,'' the group said.
   Khomeini issued a death sentence on Rushdie Feb. 14, and Iranian
clerics put a $5.2 million bounty on the author's head. Rushdie is
in hiding.
   The hand-written Arabic-language statement was accompanied by an
instant photograph of hostage Edward Austin Tracy. Revolutionary
Justice announced Oct. 21, 1986 it had kidnapped Tracy, a
58-year-old writer from Burlington, Vt.
   The group also holds Joseph James Cicippio, 58, of Valley Forge,
Pa., who was acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut
when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares that
before taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack
British police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order to
get to him and carry out the sentence,'' the statement said.
   ``We hold the British government responsible in advance for the
human and material losses among the British police and their posts
that could result from the attacks on them,'' the statement added.
   ``This warning applies to all countries that are currently
negotiating with the British government to extend asylum and
protection to Rushdie,'' the statement concluded.
   Revolutionary Justice, believed made up of Shiite Moslem Lebanese
zealots loyal to Iran, became the second group in the past four days
to threaten to kill Rushdie.
   On Sunday, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a Syrian-backed guerrilla group headed by
Ahmed Jibril, pledged to carry out Khomeini's execution order.
   On Feb. 23, another group holding American hostages in Lebanon
issued a statement vowing revenge on Rushdie and the publishers of
his book.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine pledged ``revenge
on all those who took part in strong and ferocious campaigns against
Islam ... all institutions and organizations that insulted in one
way or another'' the prophet Mohammed and his family.
   The group holds Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner. It sent a photograph of the three men with its statement but
did not threaten the hostages.
   They are among the 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held
hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Iran on Tuesday broke diplomatic relations with Britain over the
Rushdie dispute.
   Iran's Kayhan International newspaper said today the controversy
will ``leave its negative impact on the fate of the British hostages
in Lebanon.''
   There are three Britons held hostage: Anglican Church envoy Terry
Waite; journalist John McCarthy, 32; and teacher Brian Keenan, 38.

   Operators shut down one of the two
reactors at the McGuire nuclear power plant near Charlotte after a
leak caused a small amount of radioactive steam to be released into
the air, officials said today.
   There was no danger to the public or employees, but plant
officials declared an alert at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, said Duke Power
Co., which owns the plant.
   An alert is the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's second-least
serious of four emergency categories. It means that an event has
occurred that could potentially affect the safety of the plant.
   ``The average person should not have cause for concern,'' Duke
spokesman Mike Mullen said. ``The unit was shut down safely and the
unit right next to it is continuing to supply power to our customers
on a cold morning. We will continue to keep the public's health and
safety at the top of our concerns.''
   Utility officials could not provide any measurement of the steam
leak, but Mullen said the radioactive material released was ``within
the conservative operating specifications'' of the plant.
   Mullen said the leak occurred in one or more of the 4,600 small
tubes that each of the plant's eight generators has to receive
super-heated water from the reactor core. The heat boils
uncontaminated water to create steam, which runs turbines that
generate electricity in a secondary unit, separate from the
containment building where the reactor is located.
   ``One or more of these tubes developed a leak,'' he said. ``It's
not uncommon for this to occur and to have the potential for the
water in the secondary unit to become contaminated.
   ``This is one of those events our operators are trained to deal
with on simulators,'' he said. ``This was a textbook example of how
to react.''
   Mullen said it was too soon to predict the cost of repairs, which
could take weeks.
   ``This will require cleaning up the secondary side where the
contamination occurred,'' he said. ``We also will have to repair the
tubes.''
   Al Warlick, spokesman for the state Department of Crime Control
and Public Safety, said an emergency response team was assembled in
Raleigh to monitor plant conditions.

   Premier Andreas Papandreou plans to sue
Time magazine for printing the comments of a Greek banker who
accused Papandreou of involvement in a banking scandal, the
government said today.
   The announcement made over state-run radio and television did not
say when Papandreou would file suit against the New York-based
magazine.
   Papandreou described as ``despicable'' the interview with
banker-publisher George Koskotas, the central figure in the scandal.
   A spokesman for Time said today the magazine tried to interview
Papandreou before publishing the article.
   ``We remain interested in the prime minister's response to Mr.
Koskotas' allegations. We hope that these matters will be fully and
promptly aired in a public forum rather than a court of law,'' said
Robert Marshall of Time's legal department.
   Opposition parties, meanwhile, continued to demand Papandreou's
resignation. The Greek Communist Party said general elections should
be held as soon as possible. It called for mass nationwide rallies
next Wednesday to protest the scandals.
   The governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement's second four-year
term in office ends in June.
   Koskotas, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, has been accused
of siphoning off $200 million of the bank's funds. He fled Greece in
November and ended up in the United States, where he is being held
in a Salem, Mass., jail pending the outcome of a Greek request for
extradition.
   The Time interview quoted the 34-year-old Koskotas as saying
Papandreou and several leading members of his government allegedly
authorized a plan to embezzle millions of dollars from the bank.
   Government spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos made it clear that
Papandreou and his government had no intention of stepping down.
   ``His opponents who never have been and never will be able to
defeat him in elections, dream of his resignation,'' said
Kostopoulos.
   He repeated charges that the Koskotas scandal was part of a
series of ``orchestrated attacks against Papandreou by local and
foreign centers of destabilization'' which were aimed at subverting
what he described as the popular progressive movement in Greece.

   Tugboat crewman Tom Scott knew the credit
card call to his wife from New York via a marine-telephone linkup
wouldn't be cheap.
   But his bill, all 244 pages of it, totaled $11,178.84.
   ``I about fell on the floor,'' Scott said. ``I couldn't believe
it at first. It's thick as a telephone book. Then I realized what it
was.''
   He had used his calling card, reading the number over the boat's
radio to the marine operator.
   ``Evidently someone had some ears and picked up on it,'' he said.
   Scott thinks whoever heard the number on the airwaves quickly
sold it or allowed friends to use it. All the calls on the bill were
from New York City, but they were to numbers as far away as Miami,
Strasburg, Mo., and Mexico City.
   The AT&amp;T security office called Scott right after it happened and
asked if he used his card often, Scott said.
   ``I said, well, not really, maybe two or three times,'' he
recalled. ``They said like 48 times in one hour.''
   Scott said most of the calls were charged through National
Telephone Service in Texas, which he said would get stuck with the
bill.
   Meantime, Scott says he will pay one two-minute call _ the
original call to his wife from New York.
   ``That was about $4,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Plead Guilty to Drug Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men have pleaded guilty to drug charges
that resulted from the efforts of a woman who went undercover to
help her daughters get off drugs.
   Jimmy Ray Goddard, 55, of Dallas, and Thomas Reed Wilson, 53, of
Independence, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Polk County Circuit Court to
charges of criminal conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine.
Sentencing was set for April 17.
   The two were among six men arrested in October after Pat Morrison
infiltrated the group that allegedly supplied her daughters with
methamphetamine.
   Police credited Morrison, a 44-year-old bartender, with helping
break a major methamphetamine operation. She often wore a hidden
microphone during visits to the farm where the group lived.
   The arrests came after police accompanied her to a state park
west of Salem where she had arranged to sell chemicals to a suspect.
   She said she decided to get involved because her daughters, ages
24 and 21, used methamphetamine and had been virtually living out of
their cars.

<BYLINE>5,000 Students March Legally in Warsaw; 3,000 Rally in Southern
Poland ^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 young people marched
peacefully today to mark the anniversary of 1968 police beatings of
students and to celebrate a government promise to legalize a banned
student group.
   About 3,000 students at Jagiellonian University in the southern
city of Krakow also rallied to support the group, the Independent
Students Association.
   Those students, heeding an appeal from the university rector, did
not leave campus and risk a confrontation with police. In February,
a series of marches in Krakow resulted in stone-throwing clashes
with police.
   In an unusual move Tuesday, Warsaw officials granted permission
for the march in their city. The decision coincided with an
agreement at negotiations between Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
government officials to restore legal status to the student
association. Like Solidarity, the student group was banned following
the December 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   The Warsaw march started when about 1,000 people walked two miles
from the Warsaw Polytechnic Institute to Warsaw University, where
they joined about 4,000 students and professors for a rally.
   Police halted traffic for the march, led by a woman pushing twins
in a baby carriage. The marchers chanted ``No success without NZS,''
the initials in Polish for the student group.
   After a wreath-laying ceremony at a campus plaque marking the
1968 events, the participants walked a few blocks off campus to a
monument honoring the 19th century Polish epic poet and patriot Adam
Mickiewicz.
   Police and plainclothes Communist Party worker activists beat
students on March 8, 1968, following student protests against the
closure of a performance of Mickiewicz's patriotic play
``Grandfathers.''
   ``The March events, looked upon from a perspective of 21 years,
make us aware of a certain great truth _ how pitifully ineffective
are the efforts of all those who stand against the natural and
inborn wish for freedom,'' Warsaw University rector Grzegorz
Bialkowski told the students.
   He told students to think about the history of the country and
consider how the 1968 events contributed to current reform efforts
in Poland.
   Many of the students expelled for taking part in the 1968 protest
became leaders of the Solidarity trade union movement, which began
in 1980.
   One, Adam Michnik, now a leading opposition theoretician and
adviser to Walesa, was welcomed to the rally at Krakow's
Jagiellonian University by rector Aleksander Koj, the chief academic
officer.
   ``It's a moving day for me. What happened 21 years ago changed my
generation and my life,'' Michnik said.
   He said students in 1968 protested because, ``We did not agree
that Poland should become a country where people were stripped of
their humanity.''

<HEAD>Reporter Arrested While Covering Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reporter for the country's
largest newspaper was detained in a courtroom today for allegedly
stealing photographs of a prostitute who is the key state witness in
a murder trial.
   Police said the call girl, Pat du Preez, had complained that
pictures of her were taken from her home without permission. Two
photographs of her were published over the weekend by the Sunday
Times.
   Janine Lazarus, a Sunday Times reporter, was sitting in
Johannesburg Supreme Court waiting for the murder trial to resume
when a plainclothes officer served her with an arrest warrant based
on Ms. du Preez's complaint.
   Ms. Lazarus was asked to accompany a police officer out of the
courthouse. After consultations involving her, the police, an editor
and a newspaper lawyer, she was allowed to remain free pending
possible further proceedings in the case. No date was set for such
proceedings.
   Ms. du Preez testified last week against Maria Krebs, 35, who is
accused of murdering her husband, Ralf Krebs, after telephoning an
escort agency and asking Ms. du Preez to come to their home for a
three-way sex session.
   Mrs. Krebs acknowledges having brandished a gun during a scuffle
that ensued but says her husband was killed by a shot that was fired
accidentally.
   The trial has been front-page news in many South African
newspapers for the past two weeks. The prosecution completed its
arguments today.
   Photographs of Mrs. Krebs, usually smiling and elegantly dressed,
have appeared almost daily in the press, while Ms. du Preez has
shielded her face from photographers.

<HEAD>Funeral For Battered Woman; Ex-Husband Held In Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman authorities say was beaten to
death by her ex-husband while he was on prison furlough was buried
today, but friends who shared her outrage on behalf of battered
women said her cause will live on.
   ``We want to make sure that next week, when this week's papers
are thrown out in the trash, that this is not forgotten,'' says
Michalyn Chilcote, director of the Elkhart County Women's Shelter,
where 29-year-old Lisa Bianco worked.
   At Ms. Bianco's funeral at St. Anthony Catholic Church, the Rev.
Barry England remembered her as a caring person. Several mourners
wore small blue ribbons to symbolize her commitment to helping
battered women.
   ``In a world filled with people who think only of themselves, she
was a person who cared deeply for others,'' he said. ``Lisa listened
to people who cried out. She healed their wounds. Having experienced
pain and hurt herself, she continued to love.''
   Ms. Bianco's 38-year-old ex-husband, Alan L. Matheney, was
charged with murder and burglary Tuesday, three days after she was
bludgeoned to death outside her home in this town near the Michigan
state line.
   Hours before her death, Matheney was released from a state prison
on an eight-hour furlough. He had been serving an eight-year term at
the Correctional Industrial Complex for beating Ms. Bianco and
criminally confining their two children in 1987.
   Matheney is being held without bond after an automatic plea of
innocent was entered in Superior Court.
   He appeared in court Tuesday with swelling and bruises around his
eyes, the result of an assault at the St. Joseph County jail, said
sheriff's Cpl. Charles Feirrell. The assault occurred in a cell
where Matheney was being held with three other prisoners and is
being investigated, Feirrell said. After the beating, Matheney was
placed in isolation, he said.
   Ms. Bianco, who started again using her maiden name after the
divorce, had been putting her life back together, say co-workers and
acquaintances.
   She had taken a job at the women's shelter and joined a
commission on the status of women, but co-workers said she always
feared her ex-husband would return to kill her.
   ``She said her choice at that time would be to run, change her
identity and hope he wouldn't find her, or stay and fight,'' said
Ms. Chilcote. ``She wasn't quite sure what was going to happen.''
   On Saturday, while neighbors watched, Ms. Bianco was struck on
the head at least 20 times with an unloaded shotgun used as a club,
authorities said. She died at the scene before help arrived, said
Coroner Dr. Louis Grwinski.
   Matheney was arrested a short time later in nearby South Bend.
   ``It seemed like it didn't faze him in the least,'' said Sgt.
Norval Williams, who arrested Matheney. ``He had, you might say,
completed a mission he set out to achieve.''
   Because of the slaying, Gov. Evan Bayh suspended the
prison-release program until the end of the month pending a review.
Two state Department of Correction employees also were suspended for
granting the furlough and failing to notify Ms. Bianco.
   Bonnie Bailey, president of the Mishawaka Commission on the
Status of Women, to which Ms. Bianco was appointed late last year,
described the victim as a ``very quiet person, low-keyed,
soft-spoken.'' She said Ms. Bianco did not talk about her battered
past, ``but typically that is a secret of the victim.''
   Ms. Bianco started as a counselor at the shelter in August and
rose quickly into a $14,000-a-year job as program director, said Ms.
Chilcote. She also recently had completed a bachelor's degree at
Indiana University, taking psychology and business courses.
   ``Lisa did everything she could to legally get into the system
and get her husband locked up and the system failed,'' Ms. Bailey
said.

   Moslem guerrillas today seized a
government military outpost that protects Jalalabad and also
attacked the airport at the strategically important eastern Afghan
city, rebel sources said.
   Also today, the president of the guerrilla government-in-exile
told the Afghan people in his first radio broadcast from Pakistan
that his fighters are ``on the verge of final victory'' over their
government's forces.
   The insurgents fired long-range artillery late Tuesday at the
Samarkhiel fortress and overran it this morning, a guerrilla
spokesman named Satullah said in the Pakistani border city of
Peshawar.
   Several other Afghan sources confirmed Satullah's claim, but
there was no independent confirmation. No casualty count was given.
   The guerrillas attacked the airport at the same time as the
Samarkhiel offensive, a guerrilla source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Insurgents destroyed a military transport plane parked at the
airport Tuesday, and Radio Kabul said two people were killed. The
radio report monitored in Islamabad gave few details but was
confirmed by rebel sources.
   Satullah said guerrilla positions around Jalalabad, particularly
to the south of the city, were heavily bombed in retaliation for
rebels' Samarkhiel conquest. Another rebel source said ``there was
indiscriminate bombing last night and this morning.''
   The rebels downed a helicopter gunship and Soviet-made MiG-25
fighter jet today near Jalalabad, said Satullah. The government
aircraft were hit by U.S.-made missiles. There were no survivors, he
said.
   Guerrilla sources gave conflicting reports about the fighting at
Jalalabad airport, with one source claiming the insurgents had
captured it.
   ``The fighting at the airport is still continuing,'' Satullah
said.
   Stinger missiles, which Washington began supplying to the
guerrillas almost two years ago, are credited with inflicting costly
losses on Moscow's air force during the nine-year Soviet military
intervention that ended last month.
   In a 16-minute radio address from the guerrillas' headquarters in
Peshawar, the leader of the government-in-exile, Sibghatullah
Mojaddidi, told Afghans:
   ``We have no doubt at all that the puppet ... government which is
responsible for the killing, the destruction and the displacement of
millions of Afghan refugees will never be able to stand against
Afghanistan again.''
   He said his top priority is the ``complete removal of the
government in Kabul, the return of peace and security to the whole
country, and preparations for the suitable conditions for the return
of reguees.''
   Mojaddidi called on the United Nations and the Islamic Conference
organization to recognize his government-in-exile, which says it
will hold its first Cabinet meeting Friday at an undisclosed
location inside Afghanistan.
   Jalalabad is about 45 miles west of the Pakistan border on the
highway that connects Pakistan and the Afghan capital of Kabul.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat today laid
the cornerstone of a Palestinian Embassy in Pakistan's capital.
   Pakistan was the first country to recognize the independent state
declared in November by the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile.
   ``We know for freedom there is a very high price,'' said Arafat.
``As you have paid for your freedom, we will continue to pay for
ours,'' he told Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   More than 100 foreign diplomats and dignitaries, many from Middle
East and East bloc countries, attended the ceremony.
   The PNC said Jerusalem would be the Palestinian state's capital,
but it did not specify the state's boundaries.
   A 21-gun salute and a flyover, by six U.S.-made F-16 jet
fighters, greeted the PLO chairman upon his arrival in Islamabad.
   Arafat earlier made a brief stop in Ms. Bhutto's hometown of
Larkana and laid a floral wreath at the grave of her father,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
   The elder Bhutto was overthrown by army Gen. Mohammad Zia-ul Haq
in a 1977 coup and hanged two years later. Zia died in August when
his aircraft crashed. His death paved the way for the first free
elections in more than a decade, which brought Ms. Bhutto to power.
   ``He (Bhutto) is following in spirit this celebration,'' said
Arafat, who was a friend of Bhutto's.
   The PLO chief was expected to meet President Ghulam Ishaq Khan
and Afghan guerrilla leaders before going to India on Thursday.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization's consul general, Ahmed
Alhih, said Arafat hoped to play an ``important role'' in solving
the Afghan problem.
   Moslem guerrillas have battled Afghanistan's communist government
for a decade and have vowed to overthrow it. Last month in Pakistan,
guerrilla leaders declared a government-in-exile, basing the move on
presumptions the Afghan government will fall and the guerrillas will
take power.
   Alhih said the PLO chief is not expected to give the Afghan
guerrilla government recognition. The PLO is allied with Moscow and
New Delhi, while the Afghan guerrillas are supported by the United
States and Pakistan.

   The Seattle Times on drug-treatment rules:
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome has broken all the rules, and
society is slowly reacting to the epidemic.
   The latest change is a recommendation from two federal health
agencies to make methadone, a synthetic narcotic, more readily
available to heroin addicts seeking treatment.
   The goal is to fight the spread of AIDS through needle sharing by
intravenous drug abusers.
   In less than a decade, this fatal disease has claimed 49,976
lives, and has been diagnosed in 39,000 more people. After a halting
start the medical community is in hot pursuit of vaccines, but the
disease has proven an elusive target. ...
   Weaning addicts from needles with methadone or reducing the reuse
of needles by distributing clean needles takes a change of attitude
for ... professionals, lawmakers and citizens.
   As the human and financial toll of the AIDS epidemic mounts,
society will be reassessing many old values.
   These early public health adjustments may seem quaint.

   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on acid rain:
   When asked recently by Canadians when he intended to do something
about reducing acid rain clouds that float northward toward the
dominion, President Bush said: ``I have in mind, `as fast as
possible.'''
   While it's not a firm timetable, it's a welcome change from the
stance of the Reagan administration; it never seemed quite able to
figure out where the pollution was coming from.
   Bush's move is a good one simply because it is right. There are
too many people on the face of our globe to continue abusing it as
we have. A commitment from the world's largest industrialized nation
to abate this maltreatment comes none too soon.
   To that end, Bush has pledged his personal backing, as well as _
to begin with _ $2.5 billion over five years for clean-coal
technology. Let's hope it produces results.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Brazil's rain forest:
   Brazilian President Jose Sarney says he's distressed at the way

rain forest.
   He sits on a high horse and talks about how those in the United
States and Europe have no room to throw stones. It is the industrial
nations that gave the world acid rain, a depleted ozone and a
growing greenhouse problem, says Brazil's interior minister.
   Fine, Mr. Sarney. Don't listen to those busybodies from countries
with economies far healthier than Brazil's. Listen to Brazil.
   Listen to what Brazil's diverse, indigenous groups have to say.
Several dozen Amazon Indian tribes got together for a conference
(last month) to demand a say in the development of their homeland.
They want dams on a tributary of the Amazon stopped. ...
   These are people who understand how to use the wonderful,
mysterious plants of the rain forest. They tap resources the
scientists of the developed world have yet to discover. Exchange the
wealth of their culture and rain forest for the short-term gain of a
dam here or a road there and Brazil will shortchange its future.
   Brazil doesn't have to listen to world opinion. But for its own
sake, it ought to listen to the voices from within.

   No one forces a guest to pick up the Bible from the nightstand,

   The News &amp; Observer, Raleigh, N.C., on day care:
   Day care is a painful dilemma for working parents, whether those
parents work to scrape by, or whether they work to afford the status
symbols of the up and coming.
   Finding care for the most important people in their lives, their
children, is a financial and emotional burden.
   It is the burden of government as well, as states seek to define
their role in providing day care assistance to those who cannot
afford it. ...
   Though it's no longer uncommon for both parents in a home to work
full-time, and certainly common for single mothers and fathers to
work, employers have taken the attitude that caring for children is
the family's problem. It is, but not entirely.
   Children who are not given adequate care in their first three or
four years frequently find themselves behind in school from the
start, and they never catch up. That hurts them in the adult work
force, and it ultimately hurts their community and their state.
   In that sense, then, the lack of good day care is everyone's
problem.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on wasting energy:
   Making more efficient use of energy has always been the key to
improving standards of living despite dwindling resources and
mounting environmental concerns.
   But two years ago the United States' progress toward more
efficient use of energy stalled. Last year, the country actually
lost ground in terms of efficiency. ...
   For the first time since the energy crisis of the 1970s, (in
1988) Americans' appetite for oil, coal, natural gas and other types
of energy grew faster than their productive output.
   A continued decline in energy efficiency would have a number of
unwanted consequences.
   The nation's bill for imported oil _ already $40 billion a year _
would rise without a corresponding increase in economic output. The
rate at which finite energy resources are depleted would accelerate.
Air pollution, acid rain and the greenhouse effect would be
aggravated. ...
   (M)any of the problems caused by wasteful energy consumption,
ranging from smog to excessive reliance on foreign suppliers, need
to be addressed even if energy remains cheap and plentiful.

   But no longer, an East-coast friend of ours complained the other

reported, were the following:
   _ Bob Probert, a Detroit Red Wings forward, was charged with
smuggling 14.3 grams of cocaine across the U.S.-Canadian border.
   _ Darryl Strawberry of the New York Mets took a swing at a
teammate and walked out of training camp, angry because he was only
the sixth-highest-paid player on the team, pulling down a mere $1.4
million this year.
   _ Strawberry and his sparring partner, first baseman Keith
Hernandez, later had a meeting with _ get this _ the Mets' team
psychiatrist.
   _ A track coach testified that anabolic steroids were a major
component of the training program of sprinter Ben Johnson before the
1987 world track and field championships. ...
   It was all news, of course, and it belonged in the paper. At the
same time, we join our friend in wishing that more athletes would
act more like athletes and less like overpaid, overaged adolescents.

   Pope John Paul II opened an extraordinary
meeting with U.S. Roman Catholic leaders today and challenged them
to proclaim the church's message in ``a world that does not often
readily accept it.''
   John Paul spoke briefly in English to 36 U.S. prelates summoned
to Rome for a meeting the Americans hope will ease tensions between
U.S. Catholics and the Vatican, which has been unhappy about dissent
among the American faithful.
   Many American Catholics, for instance, disregard church teaching
on matters such as artificial birth control and remarriage for
divorced people.
   The role of the bishop is expected to be the dominant topic in
the 12 hours of discussions with top Vatican officials through
Saturday. Other issues on the agenda include the family, the
sacraments and Christian education.
   ``I wish to encourage you in your ministry,'' the pope told the
bishops, gathered in the Vatican's Old Synod Hall. ``I am fully
conscious of the challenges you face in bringing the Gospel message
to a world that does not often readily accept it.''
   ``Your people experience the difficulties of being Christians in
today's world. Yet at the same time they search for direction in
following the path marked out by Christ.''
   Earlier today, a cardinal representing the U.S. bishops declared
that American democratic freedoms are not at odds with faithfulness
to the church.
   American bishops have maintained that disagreement among
Catholics reflects their democratic heritage. The pope, however,
says people cannot dissent from church teachings and be considered
``good Catholics.''
   ``As U.S. bishops, we value highly the founding principles of our
country and its democratic traditions,'' Cardinal Joseph Bernardin
of Chicago said at a news conference before today's meeting began.
   ``While as a community we operate according to different
principles ... I do not see these freedoms or their exercise as
being in conflict with our faithfulness to the universal, Catholic
tradition that is ours.''
   Cardinal Bernardin Gantin, head of the Vatican Congregation for
Bishops, said ``there isn't alarm'' in the Vatican about the U.S.
church, but ``it is true that problems exist.''
   ``We already studied the burning, difficult, serious problems''
during visits by U.S. bishops last year, he said at the news
conference, and this week's meeting will focus on how to resolve
them. He mentioned the secularization of U.S. society as a problem
for the American church.
   ``I expect that there will be a free-flowing discussion among
everyone there,'' Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis, president of
the U.S. National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said in an
interview Tuesday.
   He added: ``There will be probably, in any free-flowing
discussion, points of difference, points of difference that will be
discussed and faced.''
   The Vatican believes the 52-million-member American church is
critical because of its size, its wealth and its potential to set
worldwide trends.
   The pope summoned much of the American Catholic hierarchy to Rome
for this week's session: the five active U.S. cardinals, 30
archbishops and a bishop, all representing major dioceses.
   Bernardin said Tuesday that the U.S. hierarchy hoped to increase
the Vatican's understanding of American culture and the church's
part in it.
   ``When you are involved in a universal church such as ours, there
is a need for communication,'' he said. ``The more we can do, the
better everyone understands what is involved.''
   May said some problems with Rome stemmed from a ``lack of
understanding'' by Vatican officials. ``Some of these men have not
been in the United States, or not very much,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   He said he hoped the meetings lead to a ``deeper understanding of
separation of church and state, a deeper understanding of freedom of
thought in the United States ... a deeper understanding of the
democratic process that we're used to, which is not always the way
things are done in the church.''

   NASA unveiled ``5 Days To Launch''
signs at space center gates Wednesday and said space shuttle
Discovery would lift off Monday with five astronauts and a $100
million communications satellite.
   Such signs usually show up about three weeks before a launch but
were displayed much later this time because suspect or faulty
equipment delayed the launch four times past its target date of Feb.
18.
   The latest setback came Monday with the failure of a system that
commands separation of the two booster rockets and external fuel
tank from the spaceship in flight. The problem prevented a Saturday
launch.
   The faulty unit was replaced with one from space shuttle Columbia
on Tuesday and was successfully tested overnight, NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone reported.
   ``The Kennedy Space Center is pressing on toward a Monday
liftoff,'' she said.
   The countdown for the 28th shuttle launch, and the third since
the Challenger accident, was scheduled to start at 12:01 a.m.
Friday, with liftoff set for 8:07 a.m. Monday.
   Discovery's crew, commanded by astronaut Michael Coats, was to
arrive Friday from the astronaut training base in Houston. The
others are John Blaha, James Bagian, James Buchli and Bob Springer.
   During five days in orbit they will deploy a communications
satellite and conduct numerous medical and other scientific
experiments.

   Protesting Howard University students succeeded
in driving Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater from the
predominantly black school's board of trustees, saying he encouraged
racism during his work for President Bush's election campaign.
   Atwater submitted a resignation letter to the school Tuesday
night after hundreds of students took over the administration
building to protest his appointment.
   Earlier Tuesday, Bush had defended the choice of Atwater, who
headed his presidential campaign, but District of Columbia Mayor
Marion S. Barry said Atwater should quit.
   In his resignation letter, Atwater said he wanted to help the
school, but ``continuing the controversy surrounding my appointment
any longer defeats that goal.''
   ``Today's events at Howard demonstrate the possibility that
someone could be injured in the protest,'' he said. ``That I could
not accept. I would never forgive myself if someone was hurt in one
of these episodes.''
   Atwater's resignation came 48 hours before Bush was scheduled to
address a United Negro College Fund dinner in New York.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that Bush had
`no reaction'' to the Atwater's stepping down, ``other than what he
told you yesterday'' during a news conference. ``He hoped things
would be worked out, and they have been''
   Fitzwater said Atwater had called Bush's chief of staff, John
Sununu, Tuesday night to tell him of his decision and Sununu then
notified the president.
   Howard students were infuriated when college president James
Cheek appointed Atwater to the board in January. The students cited
Atwater's use during the Bush campaign of ads highlighting Willie
Horton, a black rapist and murderer from the home state of
Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis.
   ``He masterminded the use of the Willie Horton issue to
contribute to the rising anti-black sentiment of the American
people,'' said Michael Lewis, a spokesman for the informal group of
students that organized protests beginning last week at the school's
convocation.
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, interviewed today on ``CBS
This Morning,'' said Atwater made the right decision.
   ``The signals that were sent in the Willie Horton ad were not so
much about (prison) furloughs, but about race inciting fears in
white people and creating very painful feelings among
African-Americans,'' Jackson said. ``After eight years of (former
President) Reagan, there are fewer (black) students in colleges,
more of them are in jail.
   ``Unfortunately, Lee Atwater symbolizes the worst of that
situation.''
   Hundreds of students had stormed through the administration
building during the annual charter day convocation and prevented
entertainer Bill Cosby from giving the main address.
   A group of students remained in the building through Tuesday,
when they were joined by hundreds more inside and out, chanting,
``Lee's gotta go!'' and ``Students Unite _ We're not to be
defeated!''
   ``It is my assessment that the Lee Atwater situation is tearing
up the university,'' Barry said after meeting privately with the
protesters. ``I think, for the sake of peace, Mr. Atwater ought to
find a way to gracefully resign.''
   Bush commented on the controversy during his news conference at
the White House. Asked if the Howard students had a legitimate
complaint, Bush said, ``No. I think it's a good thing he's on the
board. ... I think that'll work out just fine.''
   District police had stormed the administration building about
12:30 p.m. Tuesday, breaking down the front doors with clubs and
dropping officers onto the roof by helicopter.
   ``We came here to assist the Howard University force, which asked
for our help,'' said Police Chief Maurice Turner.
   But the nearly 100 officers left the scene without making any
arrests at the request of Cheek, who said school officials decided
to let the students maintain control of the building.
   ``We are not willing to have the students removed by force,''
Cheek said. ``It's too risky. We have decided to set up the
administrative process someplace else.''
   Students remained in the building even after Atwater announced
his resignation from the board, saying they intended to press other
demands with the school administration. Those demands included a
better financial aid system, improved campus security and amnesty
for protest leaders.
   Bush chose Atwater to head the Republican National Committee
shortly after the election. Atwater has said one of his goals in the
post is to attract more black support to the GOP.

   Oliver North told Nelson Bunker Hunt ``I don't
care if I have to go to jail ... I don't care if I have to lie to
Congress,'' a fund-raiser for the Contras testified today.
   Carl Channell said he overheard North make the comment to Hunt at
the close of a meeting at the Petroleum Club in Dallas on Sept. 11,
1985.
   Channell had arranged to make a plane available for North to fly
down from Washington so that the White House aide could describe the
Contras' military needs to Hunt, a wealthy Texas businessman.
   North talked to Hunt about $5 million to $6 million worth of
items the Contras needed ``to stay alive,'' recalled Channell,
including planes, two types of ammunition, clothing, food and
medical supplies. After dinner as they prepared to leave the club,
Channell listened as North and Hunt discussed Central American
politics.
   Hunt asked North whether he was worried about ``getting in
trouble,'' Channell recalled. ``Ollie said `No, I don't care if I
have to go to jail for this. I don't care if I have to lie to
Congress about this,''' Channel testified.
   Hunt just ``chortled,'' Channell recalled.
   Hunt contributed $237,500 to Channell's tax-exempt National
Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty and also made a $237,500
loan to the organization.
   Channell pleaded guilty on April 29, 1987, to depriving the
government of tax revenue by using NEPL to solicit contributions for
military equipment for the Contras.
   One of the 12 criminal charges against North is that he conspired
to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue. Six of the charges accuse
North of making false statements and obstructing Congress by
attempting to hide his efforts on behalf of the Contras.
   Channell said North worked closely with the private fund-raising
operation for the Contras.
   When one contributor, John Ramsey of Wichita Falls, Taxas, wired
money to pay for a Contra shipment that was about to be unloaded,
North sent him a mailgram saying, ``Thank you for the help on such
short notice.''
   North ended a powerful address and slide show to 30 potential
contributors on June 27, 1985 at the Old Executive Office Building
by displaying a picture of the grave of what he said was a young
Contra soldier and saying, ``Can't American do better than this.
America should be doing better than this,'' said Channell.
   Wealthy Connecticut widow Barbara Newington and others expressed
concern that their contributions might be misused and Channell said
he told North that checks were being written to five different
organizations.
   North straightened the matter out by saying that ``you should
work through'' Richard Miller and Francis Gomez, who had set up a
Cayman Islands corporation to receive contributions, Channell said.
   ``I liked Dr. (Contra leader Adolfo) Calero a lot, but he was
running a shoestring organization,'' said Channell. When he traveled
to Florida to talk to Contra leaders, it was ``almost like this
thing was going on part-time,'' said Channell.
   In August 1985, North met in his office with Channell and Ellen
Garwood, from a wealth Austin, Texas, family, who gave $75,000 to
buy a Maule aircraft to supply the Contras.
   At the meeting, North also told her of the well-armed, highly
maneuverable Soviet HIND helicopters in Nicaragua and how the
Contras needed hand-held missiles to shoot them down.
   Meanwhile, prosecutors say the jury should convict North if it
finds he engaged in a cover-up, regardless of whether he was acting
under orders or was afraid of news leaks.
   ``When an individual is asked a question by Congress, there are
only two legitimate responses: the individual may decline to answer
the question, or answer it honestly,'' the prosecution said Monday
in a court filing. ``He cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully
answer with a falsehood.''
   In opening statements, North's lawyers suggested that his conduct
was authorized by his superiors. The prosecution's motion is an
attempt to head off that defense.
   John Keker, head of the prosecution team, asked U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell to specify _ when giving final instructions to
the jury _ that North's alleged motivation for lying is irrelevant
to the charges against him.
   If North genuinely believed disclosure of certain information
would damage important interests, ``he could have made an open
refusal to disclose or invoked any applicable privilege, asserting
his reasons for doing so,'' the prosecution said.

<HEAD>Text of Revolutionary Justice Statement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The following is the text of a statement
issued Wednesday by the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which
holds American hostages in Lebanon. The Arabic-language statement
was translated by The Associated Press in Beirut.
   In the name of the Almighty.
   After a thorough reading of The Satanic Verses book and its
contents that insult Islam and the Arab prophet, and after examining
the study of the so-called Salman Rushdie, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization declares that it has completed its preparations to
execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the
great struggler Ayatollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. Hence, it
puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence:
   1. Insulting Islam and the Arab prophet is an insult to the
latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary
Islam.
   2. Salman Rushdie's record indicates that he was a branch member
of the Freemasons' movement in England. Immediately after the
publication of his Satanic Verses book, he was promoted to full
official membership of the Freemasons' highest council in England
(or the church of organized atheism) which combats divine religions,
especially christianity and Islam and their great prophets.
   3. Imam Ayatollah Khomeini, with his acute awareness of the grave
consequences against the future of the divine religions emanating
from this Freemasonic and Zionist attack, has handed down his
verdict when the Arabs and those who claim to be the protectors of
Islam and speak for all the Moslems remained in tight silence.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares that before
taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack British
police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order to get to
him to carry out the sentence. We hold the British government
responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the
British police and their posts that could result from the attacks on
them. This warning applies to all countries that are currently
negotiating with the British government to extend asylum and
protection to Rushdie.
   Victory to the oppressed
   Glory and immortality to the martyrs
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization.

   The Italian Cecchi Gori group is setting up a

movies, it was announced Wednesday.
   A subsidiary called Cecchi Gori Summit Studios (Singapore) Pvt.
Ltd. has been set up to co-produce films with North American
producers worth about $206.9 million annually, said group president
Vittorio Cecchi Gori.
   He expected directors, writers, actors and actresses to come from
Europe and the United States to work in the studio complex.
   Cecchi Gori said they plan to start filming in a year, although
the complex will be completed in two years.
   The government has granted the subsidiary pioneer status
exempting it from income tax for 10 years.

   An unusually dry winter has helped ease Africa's
disastrous locust plague, a U.N. official said Wednesday.
   ``The problem has by no means been eradicated, but it has
improved dramatically in the last five months,'' said Jeremy Roffey,
a locust expert at the Food and Agriculture Organization based in
Rome.
   Other helpful factors have been strict measures to combat the
pests and their migration to the sea as they moved across the
Atlantic.
   In January, swarms of locusts devoured crops in Sudan, Ethiopia
and Chad, which already were suffering critical food shortages.
   Desert locusts aided by easterly October winds traveled 3,100
miles to reach Caribbean islands. At the same time, locusts crossed
the Red Sea into Saudi Arabia; new invasions were reported in Cape
Verde and Senegal; and swarms reached the North African states of
Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Libya.
   Rain provides the moisture needed for locust eggs to develop in
sand or soil.

   A partial solar eclipse visible across
western North America bored scientists but thrilled crowds that were
able to see it despite clouds covering parts of the region.
   ``It's fabulous to know this is actually taking place. It's very
fascinating,'' said Edie Lurie, an employee at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, where dozens used solar
telescopes to watch the moon eclipse 37 percent of the sun at 9:50
a.m. PST Tuesday.
   As the moon passed between the Earth and sun to cause the partial
eclipse, it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon
silhouetted against the sun. Also visible were gas jets on the sun's
surface and a giant group of sunspots that on Monday and Tuesday
produced major solar flares _ eruptions of heat and radiation _
including the largest since 1984.
   Clouds over downtown Salt Lake City dashed Hansen Planetarium's
plans to set up telescopes to watch the moon block 36 percent of the
sun at 11:10 a.m. MST.
   ``It's a bummer, but that's the way it goes,'' planetarium
spokesman Patrick Wiggins said.
   The eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a
diagonal line stretching roughly from Mazatlan, Mexico, northeast to
Dallas and Chicago. Views were best farther west and north.
   In sunny Los Angeles, 600 schoolchildren and at least 400 other
people watched the eclipse at Griffith Observatory through
telescopes and other devices equipped with filters to prevent eye
injury.
   ``There was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature,''
observatory Director Ed Krupp said.
   Most astronomers were unimpressed, saying they were waiting for a
total solar eclipse that will sweep across Hawaii, the Pacific
Ocean, lower Baja California in Mexico, Central America, Colombia
and Brazil on July 11, 1991.
   ``You can see a partial eclipse every three or four years,'' said
Caltech astrophysicist Ken Libbrecht. ``They're not that exciting. A
total eclipse is exciting.''
   In Tucson, dozens of citizens peered through telescopes on the
University of Arizona mall to see the moon eclipse 23 percent of the
sun at 10:55 a.m. MST, but 90 solar scientists stayed inside,
attending a five-day conference titled ``The Sun in Time.''
   ``That's partly my fault,'' said conference co-organizer Mark
Giampapa, an astronomer at the National Solar Observatory. ``I
should have listed it in the program: `Partial eclipse, presented by
God.'''
   In Anchorage, Alaska, where the moon obscured 80 percent of the
sun at 9:13 a.m. AST, the eclipse was watched by 26 students from
Bartlett High School, several people wearing welders helmets as
filters and Providence Hospital workers who ended a staff meeting
early to see the spectacle.
   Clouds parted long enough to allow a glimpse of the eclipse for
100 people outside the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in
often rainy Portland.
   ``Typical Oregon astronomy,'' said amateur astronomer Dan Dunn.
``You always have to deal with the clouds.''
   Scientists had warned against staring at the sun directly or
through inadequate filters, including smoked glass and photographic
film or filters.
   Alan MacRobert of Sky &amp; Telescope magazine said 245 eye injuries
were reported in the United States after an eclipse in 1970, but
warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984
partial eclipse.

   Riot police Wednesday arrested 258
Hyundai workers who have been striking for three months to demand
free union activity.
   Riot police seized the shipyard workers as they marched from the
headquarters of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. near downtown Seoul to
a nearby police station to protest police attempts Tuesday to arrest
strike leaders.
   About 1,000 riot police surrounded the building Tuesday to try to
arrest strike leaders, but angry workers resisted them with clubs
and firebombs.
   The 320 strikers from South Korea's largest shipyard in the east
cost port of Ulsan have been camping in tents outside the company's
Seoul headquarters since February.
   Hyundai officials removed tents after police took away most
strikers.
   Police said most arrested workers would be released after
questioning.
   The strikers want better pay and free union activity at the
shipyard, which has been hit by a labor dispute since Dec. 12.

   Iran's U.N. ambassador said today that an
Iraqi ambush killed five Iranian soldiers Feb. 17. It would be the
deadliest clash since a cease-fire took effect seven months ago.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said members of the
U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, who have monitored the
truce, told him of the incident.
   A U.N. spokeswoman confirmed that Undersecretary-General Marrack
Goulding, the chief U.N. peacekeeper, had received reports from his
officers that ``five Iranian soldiers had been shot in the back and
killed.''
   ``Iran said that they had been killed in an Iraqi ambush;
however, the investigation by UNIIMOG observers could not confirm
this,'' the spokeswoman, Nadia Younes, said.
   Peacekeeping officials normally do not verify allegations of
truce violations by Iran and Iraq, leaving that for a
secretary-general's report that is issued every six months when the
mandate of the U.N. peacekeepers must be renewed. The most recent
report was issued Feb. 2.
   Mahallati's letter said ``Iraqi forces ambushed our patrols''
near Baneh, in the central sector of the front, 20 miles from the
border with Iraq and about 310 miles west of Tehran.
   The attack killed five Iranian soldiers on patrol, and a
communications operator was captured, said Mahallati.
   U.N. military observers ``have inspected the location where the
incident occurred, witnessing the martyrs, and have stated that the
perpetrators have fled to their bases,'' said Mahallati.
   In his Feb. 2 report, Perez de Cuellar said two Iranians died in
a Dec. 11 clash near the southern border. The nations' forces are
separated by only a few dozen yards in many places and in one place
face each other across 30 yards of desert, the secretary-general
said in the report.
   The only other reported fatality since the Aug. 20 cease-fire was
an Iranian report that one of its soldiers was killed by Iraqi
gunfire across the truce line hours after the cease-fire took effect.
   Perez de Cuellar did not confirm the report. Talks aimed at
making the cease-fire permanent have been deadlocked since August.

   Two of the city's top police officials
chased down a pair of robbery suspects after they saw one running
from a gas station with a wad of cash in his hand.
   ``Being policemen, we knew right away that we probably had an
armed robbery,'' said Capt. Joseph Stelma, who along with Chief D.
Roy Horne arrested the men on Tuesday.
   The officers had just finished lunch nearby when they spotted the
man with a fistful of bills jump into a car parked near the station.
   In an unmarked police car, Stelma, an 18-year veteran of the
department, and Horne, who has been with the sheriff's office for 38
years, chased the supects' car for about three blocks.
   ``We were right on their bumper,'' said Horne, who admitted it
had been a number of years since he had made an arrest.
   Before the suspects pulled over, they threw the money out of
their car.
   Horne later gathered up most of the money.
   It turned out that no weapon was used in the crime. One of the
men apparently reached into a cash register and grabbed a handful of
bills. The two men were charged with theft, police said.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
today approved legislation to raise the minimum wage to $4.65 an
hour over three years, and committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy
predicted the first increase in eight years would be swiftly
approved next week by the full Senate.
   The committee approved Kennedy's bill, which President Bush has
threatened to veto, by an 11-5 vote with two Republicans joining
Democrats for the majority.
   ``I think we'll get an increase. This is going to be before the
Congress, before the Senate and before the president in the next few
weeks,'' Kennedy, D-Mass., said afterward.
   ``This will basically restore a minimum standard of decency'' to
workers who are now covered by the $3.35-an-hour minimum wage that
has been in effect since 1981, he said.
   Kennedy said he is ``glad to listen'' to the administration's
proposal for a lower ``training wage'' for newly hired workers but
said he and committee Democrats remained strongly opposed to it
because it has no provision for ``real training'' and all
minimum-wage workers would be covered.
   Kennedy predicted that a presidential veto would be overridden.
``We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' he said.
   Bush raised the subject of the minimum wage during a morning
meeting with Republican leaders in Congress. White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had given Congress ``our best
and last figure up front and his proposal for an increase to $4.25
an hour is fair and firm and his last offer.''
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said last week that Bush wants an
increase of 90 cents an hour, to $4.25, over three years. She said
the raise must be accompanied by a provision allowing businesses to
pay all newly hired workers $3.35 an hour for the first six months
of their employment.
   Kennedy's support for some type of sub-minimum was qualified,
with the longtime opponent of the provision saying it would have to
be accompanied by training and education for new workers.
   ``The concept of an educational component to the minimum wage,
coupled with real training, is not unappealing,'' said Kennedy.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the committee and a
longtime opponent of the minimum wage, earlier said he will support
an increase if Democrats accept a training wage.
   ``If they'll work with the president, there will be a raise in
the minimum wage,'' said Hatch, R-Utah.
   An aide to Kennedy said the senator remains ``nowhere near the
administration's position on this'' despite his change.
   ``We are willing to discuss a training wage,'' said the aide, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``For the past eight years what we saw was intransigence (from
the White House). The Bush administration has shown some flexibility
and we too are willing to be flexible and to discuss a real training
wage,'' said the aide.
   Other Democrats also said they'll take some form of the
``training wage'' in hopes of reaching agreement with the Republican
administration.
   ``I think some kind of compromise is going to have to be worked
out, at some point,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a member of the
Labor panel who has also opposed a sub-minimum wage.
   Organized labor has opposed the second tier because of fears that
workers would be fired in favor of those covered by the lower
standard. But the AFL-CIO now says it is ``open to discussion on the
training wage.''
   ``One of the problems in the administration proposal is that
every time you take a job you become a trainee again,'' AFL-CIO
spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh said. ``And most of the jobs, the
lower-paying jobs are not skill jobs, don't require training at
all.''

   Burmese rebels shot and killed four people
when they robbed vehicles on a road near the Thai border Wednesday,
a witness said.
   Theng U, a 35-year-old Burmese merchant, told Thai reporters
rebels of the Karen movement attacked four vehicles including a bus
at the Karen State district of Mineego, three miles west of the Thai
border.
   Burmese government troops transported about 10 people wounded in
the attack to the hospital, he said.
   The Karen army of about 4,000 guerrillas is the strongest of a
dozen ethnic rebel groups in Burma, most fighting for greater
autonomy from the central government.
   Meanwhile, Thai border patrol police said the Karens on Wednesday
continued firing mortar rounds into the Burmese village of Myawaddy,
wounding two people. The Thais say the Karens have been attacking
the village since late February to retaliate against a government
attack on a Karen stronghold.

   Specially equipped military helicopters
and a medical team waited Wednesday for wind to abate enough to
allow a search for three Japanese climbers overdue on a winter
ascent of Mount McKinley.
   A twin-engine plane leased by the National Park Service
approached to within 12 miles of the 20,320-foot peak Tuesday but
was driven back by the hurricane-force wind, said John Quinley, a
park service spokesman.
   The Army plans to use Chinook helicopters in the search. The
aircraft are twin-rotor troop and cargo carriers used previously in
high-altitude rescue work.
   The three men who set out to climb North America's highest peak
last were heard from more than a week ago. They have a radio, but
efforts to contact them failed.
   Their rations probably ran out days ago, but the Park Service has
a cache of food and water at 17,200 feet, Quinley said.
   Army Maj. Sherrel Mock said officials hoped wind would subside
enough for the helicopters to reach McKinley's 17,200-foot level to
check a snow cave. If the climbers are not in the cave, an aerial
search will be conducted, Mock said.
   The missing climbers are leader Noboru Yamada, 39; Teruo Saegusa,
31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo. They began their climb Feb.
15.

   Three-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race
champion Susan Butcher pressed for the lead in the Anchorage-to-Nome
race early today as a mob of rested mushers sprinted for this
Kuskokwim River community.
   Butcher pulled out of Nikolai early today and was expected in
McGrath, 407 miles into the 1,168-mile race, at midmorning. She was
followed by Martin Buser.
   Joe Runyan was the first musher to reach McGrath Tuesday
afternoon, but he hadn't taken his mandatory 24-hour rest.
   To complete the layover requirement, he could not leave town
until 4:43 p.m. today. Butcher took her 24-hour layover in Rohn and
could leave Runyan behind. The next 18 mushers behind Butcher also
have completed their layover.
   Butcher said she believed the frantic pace Runyan set had sapped
his dogs. ``It took him 15 hours to cross the (Farewell) Burn,'' she
said. ``It took me only 10.''
   Butcher blitzed into Nikolai, 359 miles into the race, just
before midnight Tuesday. Buser, four-time Iditarod champion Rick
Swenson, DeeDee Jonrow, Joe Redington and Joe Garnie pulled in
behind her within minutes.
   From McGrath, 761 miles remain in the race.
   Most of the 46 mushers remaining in the race were into or beyond
Rohn, 266 miles into the race.
   Runyan said he was running his own race and was trying not to
dwell on the progress of his competitors.
   ``I scratched last year,'' he said. ``Big psychological blow.''
   ``This year I looked at it, laid out a plan that I figured was
feasible. If that puts me in the money, great. If it doesn't, well
I'm gonna have a good trip.''
   Mushers are vying for a $250,000 purse, with $50,000 going to the
winner. Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday
in Anchorage. Norman Vaughan, Roger Roberts and Jan Masek, all
Alaskans, have dropped out.

<TEXT>
   It's a designer's job to make good clothes.
Creative genius is another thing.
   There are lots of nice clothes on the Milan runway this week
where the Italian fall-winter 1989-90 ready to wear collections are
showing. But it wasn't until the shows of Gianfranco Ferre and Fendi
by Karl Lagerfeld that the fashion crowd was treated to innovative
creations _ the kind experts call works of art and end up in fashion
museums.
   Ferre has always stood out in the Milan designer crowd, known for
its tailored casual clothes, by creating a structured style that
looks great on slim, tall models but is more difficult to imagine on
the average woman.
   A broad shouldered sihouette, with cinched waist and narrow hips
and either a super short or calf length hemline is his trademark. He
loves billowy blouses with big stiff stand-up collars, favors pants
over skirts, and likes to nip the waistline in wide belts, and trim
cuffs and collars in rich fur.
   The genius of this winter's collection is the combining of the
conventional and the eccentric.
   Thus a pair of perfectly man-tailored gray flannel pants is
spruced up by an intricately pleated black and white blouse, topped
by a fox fur scarf, dyed to look like zebra and wrapped around the
neck.
   All of this is wonderful for the fashion pages, but how is one to
eat, drink and even talk behind a scarf that covers half the face.
   Ferre also adorns calf-length beige cashmere tunics with these
furry feminine neck warmers. More often than not, the scarves come
with warm but equally impractical enormous matching muffs.
   His blouses not only have have generous collars but also wide
cuffs with big gold cufflinks.
   Along with the staple Milan shades of brown, black and gray,
Ferre uses a lot of red, mixing it with gray flannel by day, and
black and gold by night.
   Adding his voice to the fur debate raised this week between those
opting for fake furs and those who won't settle for anything but the
real thing, Ferre not only interspersed fake and real skins, but
dyed real fox to look like fake leopard and zebra.
   The Fendis marched on in their search for unusual, innovative
ways to work the pelt.
   For more than 20 years, the Fendis have combined their fur
expertise with the designing genius of Karl Lagerfeld to create the
most imaginative story in the fur market. Several years ago they
exhibited their combined technical and creative efforts at Rome's
modern art gallery.
   For next season, Fendi takes the fur to its bare minimum,
stripping it of lavish silk and quilted linings and tanning the
leather side to look like polished cotton. Thus, every coat is
reversible.
   Sometimes the pelts from the humble beaver to the lofty mink is
worked in patches, with tufts of fur pearing through the leather
side. At others it is pierced to create a feather-like lacey effect.
   This minimal look is further emphasized by the taupe-colored
ribbed wool tunics and tights that were the exclusive under-coat
outfit.
   There is lots of combining of fur and fabric in this Fendi
collection with fur inlays livening up otherwise simple wool coats.
   These furs _ starting at more than $5,000 with some coats at
nearly $100,000 _ are not for the woman who has saved for years for
her one fur coat. The furs are not showy and not terribly warm, and
despite the exquisite workmanship, have a fragile look.

   This city is a prime place to sample the

because residents are so, well, average.
   Des Moines residents are surveyed by phone more often per capita
than people anywhere else in the nation, according to a Connecticut
company that sells phone numbers to market researchers.
   ``Des Moines is considered kind of average, your typical U.S.
metro kind of thing,'' said Beth Wallace, a spokeswoman for Survey
Sample Inc. ``Our customers want average metro areas.''
   Des Moines Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Debra Steilen said the
city is far from being average, regardless of statistical profiles.
``We would say that people care what Des Moines residents think and
leave it at that,'' she said.

   Just about any request for directions in
this town evokes some instruction involving the Big Chicken, so a
recent suggestion to move the structure down the road to Smyrna laid
an egg at City Hall.
   ``I'm sure if the chicken had a choice it would stay in
Marietta,'' said Mayor Vicki Chastain.
   The 63-foot tall chicken head atop a fried chicken restaurant has
been a landmark for drivers and pilots for more than 20 years.
   John Patterson, city administrator in Smyrna, just south of
Marietta, recently asked Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. to move the
bird to a new fast food outlet planned for Smyrna. The company said
it would consider the idea.
   But both city's mayors disapproved of Patterson's proposal.
   ``I'm sure all the City Council members would throw themselves in
front of whatever vehicle would move it,'' said Ms. Chastain.
   Smyrna Mayor Max Bacon said he was satisfied with his city's
landmark, a clock tower, and saw no need to bring in ``their
pigeon-dropping Big Chicken.''

   A hunting preserve operator who buys wild
pigeons by the hundreds says Nebraskans can't hold a feather to bird
wranglers in other Midwestern states.
   Earl Voss has been buying wild pigeons for 10 years to sell to
trainers of hunting dogs. Every spring and fall, he leaves LeSueur,
Minn., hops into a truck and tours surrounding states, buying
40,000-50,000 birds a year.
   Most of his best pigeon catchers are in Minnesota and South
Dakota, where he said a youngster with a flashlight and a net on a
long wooden pole can net 75 to 100 pigeons a night.
   The secret of a good roundup is to seal all the exits in a barn,
he said.
   ``Nobody ever catches 'em all _ they're pretty sly _ but it's
nothing to catch 1,000 in a night,'' Voss said.
   Last month he placed ads in a dozen Nebraska newspapers offering
$1.15 per pigeon. Most Nebraska callers have had 10 to 15 of the
birds.
   ``I don't know why they bother,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Making Scant Progress Against Dangerous Wastes: GAO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department has been largely
unsuccessful in developing and implementing a program to minimize
hazardous wastes at military bases, the General Accounting Office
said Wednesday.
   The agency, an investigative arm of Congress, found that the
services have made varying degrees of progress in implementing
programs to reduce hazardous waste 50 percent by the end of 1992.
   ``Clearly the Pentagon's efforts to reduce the amount of
hazardous waste generated, have to date, been unsatisfactory,'' said
Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., one of two congressmen who requested the
report.
   The GAO study found that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force
report annually on hazardous wastes to the Pentagon but that the
report does not require the information be correlated with the
workload of major military installations.
   In addition, the GAO found a number of inconsistencies and
inaccurate methods of data collection, making the information
unreliable. ``It's the same old problem we have found in every other
aspect of DOD's hazardous waste program _ somehow the message never
gets through to the base commander or others responsible for
day-to-day waste management activities,'' said Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla.
   The Pentagon is spending $500 million in fiscal 1989 to clean up
the old hazardous waste dumps and other sites and more than $100
million a year disposing of newly generated hazardous waste.
   The GAO report recommended that the secretary of defense
establish a standard methodology for collecting and reporting
hazardous waste within the department.

<HEAD>Report Calls For ``Supersaver'' Savings Bond Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private report called Wednesday for a
national campaign to reverse an economy-damaging decline in
America's savings rate by offering government ``Supersaver'' bonds
through monthly payroll deductions.
   The report, released by the American Business Conference, said a
low national savings rate is the biggest economic problem facing the
United States and threatens its ability to remain competitive in the
global market.
   ``Our high consumption rate ... is the single most important
cause of both unprecedented trade deficits and inadequate domestic
investment during the mid-1980s,'' the report said. ``Restoring
national saving at least to the level of the 1970s should be the
central goal of national economic policy.''
   The authors found that while the government's huge budget
deficits _ ``the most popular villain'' _ have contributed to the
problem, the decline in national savings primarily has been caused
by high consumption of products and services by individuals.
   George Hatsopoulos, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston and lead author of the report, said ``Supersaver'' bonds
would help people establish regular savings programs since the
securities could be purchased only through monthly payroll
deductions.
   People would be less likely to spend earnings from the
government-issued bonds since the profits would be available only
when the securities were redeemed after seven years, he said.
   Hatsopoulos said people would be attracted to the bonds by
premium interest rates and a national campaign to persuade them that
``it's not only good for you, it's also good for the country.''
   Overall, national savings _ the difference between the nation's
output in goods and services and what is consumed by government and
individuals _ fell from 7.9 percent in the 1970s to 2.1 percent
during 1985-87, the study indicated.
   Over the same period, individuals' consumption of goods and
services rose from 69.3 percent of national income to 74.1 percent.
   The report attributed the increase in personal consumption
largely to growth in disposable income, a rise in household wealth
that exceeded the increase in national wealth, the maturing of the
population to ages above 16 when spending is higher, and the
spending of equity that was converted to cash in corporate takeovers
and buyouts.
   It found that people cannot be counted on to ``rationally
formulate lifetime consumption plans based on both their current
wealth and their expected earnings,'' and that they tend to spend
more if they have extra cash on hand.
   The report said the propensity to spend whatever is on hand has
been highlighted as people receive unexpected lumps of cash from
their stock investments when they are paid premiums in the course of
corporate buyouts.
   Rather than reinvesting the cash payments, a big portion gets
spent, the authors found.
   ``Even high-income households with substantial asset holdings may
overreact to fluctuations in current income, failing to distribute a
current windfall over current and future consumption,'' it found.
   In addition to recommending a program to increase personal
savings, the report also proposed action on two other fronts to
increase national savings from a low point that is unprecedented for
a period of economic expansion, not only for the United States but
for all industrialized countries:
   _Reducing the federal deficit. Cutting government spending on
goods and services is the most direct approach, although raising
taxes and thus lowering private consumption would help to a lesser
degree, the report said.
   _Eliminating incentives for corporate buyouts. The report said
the federal tax structure should be revised to eliminate incentives
for corporate debt and thus reduce the trend toward higher cash
payouts to shareholders.
   The authors cautioned that while the goal should be to return
America to the savings rate of the 1970s, the shift ``should not be
done too rapidly,'' lest the decline in demand topple the country
into recession.
   The study was written by Hatsopoulos, who is chairman of Thermo
Electron Corp., and Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists
James Poterba and Paul Krugman. The American Business Conference is
a group of 100 chief executives from fast-growing, mid-sized
companies.

   Armenia's Supreme Court sentenced two Armenians to
18 months' jail for organizing the storming of an airport in a
violent campaign for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, the
Moscow News reported.
   Albrik Gevoyan, 37, and Artur Pogosyan, 30, were convicted of
organizing ``group actions violating public order'' that led to a
shutdown of Zvarnots Airport at the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
   Several thousand Armenians stormed the airport July 4-5 to try to
get aviation workers to join a strike. Troops shot and killed one
demonstrator and at least 36 people were injured.
   The ethnic disturbances disrupted 65 flights and cost $3.2
million, authorities said.
   Armenians began striking and demonstrating last year to demand
control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian area of the
neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. Moscow refused the demand, but
placed the region temporarily under its direct control.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House Science subcommittee
said Wednesday his panel ``feels a very strong sense of
frustration'' over the Bush administration's failure to fund a new
program designed to assist U.S. industry with high-technology
innovation.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., spoke out at a hearing focusing on the
Advanced Technology Program at the Commerce Department's National
Institute of Technology and Standards.
   The program is designed to coordinate development of
emerging-technologies and manufacturing-research consortia; foster
industry, government and university partnerships, and monitor
cooperation between federal and regional agencies.
   But no money was allotted for the program in the fiscal 1989 or
1990 budgets.
   Walgren said that when the trade bill, of which the program is a
part, became law last year, ``we had high hopes that finally ... we
can move ahead and provide the same kind of support to American
companies that is provided to science-based commercial activities in
the countries which are our greatest competitors.''
   He asserted that ``if we do not modernize our thinking about the
role of government and provide the American private sector with the
resources they need to compete against the kind of competition which
is coming from overseas, we will, I'm afraid, miss out on the vast
payoffs which these technologies promise.''
   Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said ``the jury is still out''
regarding what attitude the new administration will take toward the
Advanced Technology Program and other civilian high-technology
initiatives.
   ``Until we have a national science adviser and the president gets
his team in place, we might suspend judgment, at least critical
judgment,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lynn Teacher Files for Annulment From Soviet Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who fought for nine years to win the
release of her Russian fiance from the Soviet Union has filed for
annulment less than nine months after marrying him.
   Elizabeth Condon, a high school language teacher, is seeking an
annulment from Viktor M. Novikov, alleging he used her for passage
to the United States, The Daily Evening Item of Lynn reported in
today's editions.
   The couple made headlines a year ago when they were reunited
after nearly 10 years apart because Novikov was unable to leave the
Soviet Union. The reunion, after years of persistent lobbying by
Condon, came on the eve of the Reagan-Gorbachev superpower summit.
   Condon, 45, met Novikov, 56, in 1967 while leading a study tour
in the Soviet Union. She returned to visit him and they made plans
to marry but Soviet officials refused to let Novikov leave. In 1979,
Condon began lobbying for his release by writing letters and
contacting politicians.
   They were married May 28.
   Condon filed a complaint Feb. 3 in Essex Probate Court in Salem,
alleging Novikov encouraged her love and attention because he wanted
to leave the Soviet Union, the Item reported. The complaint also
said the marriage was never consummated.

<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Claim Capture of Army Post Protecting Jalalabad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY GANNON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan rebels said Wednesday they
overran an army post that protects Jalalabad, the strategic city
near the Khyber Pass, and Kabul radio accused Pakistan of air and
artillery attacks across the border.
   The guerrilla government's leader said in a radio broadast from
Pakistan the Moslem insurgents were ``on the verge of final
victory'' over the Marxist government of Afghanistan three weeks
after the Soviet military withdrawal.
   Pakistani officials could not be reached for comment about the
charges of military interference, but Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
dismissed similar charges last month.
   Jalalabad, capital of Nangarhar province, is 75 mites east of
Kabul on the highway to Pakistan, about 45 miles from the border.
   One guerrilla source said the Jalalabad airport also had been
captured, but another spokesman, known only as Satultah, said in
Peshawar, Pakistan, that fighting continued there.
   Satullah said guerrillas bombarded the Samarkhiel fortress on
Jalalabad's outskirts with long-range artiltery late Tuesday and it
fell early Wednesday. Kabul radio said the garrison was attacked,
but reported only one soldier killed and did not say it had fallen.
   Several other Afghan sources confirmed Satullah's claim, but
there was no independent confirmation.
   Kabul radio said ``Pakistan forces are using their helicopter
gunships and heavy artillery'' to attack government positions in
eastern Nangarhar province and in Kandahar, the southeastern
province.
   Ms. Bhutto said last month the Pakistan military had not
participated in Afghanistan's decade-old civil war and would not do
so.
   About 3.5 million Afghan refugees live just inside Pakistan, in
border camps and cities the insurgents use as bases and supply
points.
   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April
1978 and Soviet soldiers entered Afghanistan in December 1979. An
estimated 115,000 were there at outset of the U.N.-sponsored
withdrawal, which was completed Feb. 15.
   Afghanistan's official radio also said four Pakistan army
helicopters flew Afghan guerrilla leaders and field commanders
Wednesday to Ghazi Abad, about 10 miles east of Jalalabad.
   Insurgents destroyed a military transport plane at the Jalalabad
airport Tuesday. Kabul radio, in a report confirmed by guerrilla
sources, said two people were killed.
   Satullah said insurgent positions around the city, particularly
to the south, were bombed in retaliation for the capture of the
Samarkhiel fortress. Another guerrilla source reported
``indiscriminate bombing last night and this morning.''
   Insurgents near Jalalabad shot down an Afghan helicopter gunship
and a Soviet-made MiG-25 jet with U.S.-made missiles Wednesday and
there were no survivors, Satullah said.
   Stinger missiles are credited with inflicting costly losses on
the Soviet air force since Washington began supplying them to the
insurgents two years ago. The United States and Pakistan have been
the main suppliers of arms and financial backing to the guerrillas.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, presisent of the new government-in-exile,
told Afghans in a 16-minute radio address from insurgent
headquarters in Peshawar:
   ``We have no doubt at all that the puppet ... government which is
responsible for the killing, the destruction and the displacement of
millions of Afghan refugees will never be able to stand against
Afghanistan again.''
   He said his priority is ``complete removal of the government in
Kabul, the return of peace and security to the whole country and
preparations for the suitable conditions for the return of
refugees.''
   Mojaddidi asked the United Nations and the Islamic Conference
organization to recognize his government, which he said would hold
its first Cabinet meeting Friday inside Afghanistan. The site was
not disclosed.

<HEAD>Bork Says His Senate Ordeal Set Stage For Tower Grilling</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tower, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WYOMISSING, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork
says his grilling before the Senate in 1987 set a precedent for the
rough treatment that John Tower is getting in confirmation hearings
for secretary of defense.
   ``Of course I feel sympathy for him,'' Bork said Tuesday before
addressing 350 local Republicans. ``I think my episode set a
pattern. ... Those folks tasted a little blood.''
   Senate confirmation of Tower has been jeopardized by allegations
of drinking and womanizing and concerns about his ties to defense
contractors.
   Bork, nominated for the Supreme Court by President Reagan,
testified for 30 hours over five days during his confirmation
hearings, defending his conservative record and narrow reading of
constitutional protections that enraged civil liberties and women's
rights groups.
   After listening to 112 witnesses over 12 sessions, the Senate
rejected Bork's nomination 58-42. It was only the 11th time the
Senate had voted against a Supreme Court nominee.
   During a dinner speech, the former federal appellate judge said,
``I think it's legitimate to ask if (Tower) has personal habits that
will interfere with the performance of his duties.'' But he added
that Tower should be confirmed because those habits did not prevent
him from being an effective senator or compiling an impressive
resume.
   Bork said there is a new ``venomous mood'' in the capital, and
``Senate Democrats in a variety of ways are intent on taking over
the functions of the president.''
   Bork left the bench in 1988 to ``debate, discuss how we should
view the Constitution and how we should select judges.'' He is
working on a book that explores the intrusion of politics into
constitutional law.

<HEAD>Two More Arrested in Japanese Stock Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors made two more arrests Wednesday in an
insider-trading scandal that has raised questins about Japan's
big-money politics and stained the vaunted integrity of its civil
service.
   Opposition parties boycotted debate on the budget, bringing
Parliament's business to a halt, and renewed their demands that
Prime Minister Noburo Takeshita call new elections and resign so the
public can render its verdict.
   Those arrested Wednesday were Takashi Kato, a former vice
minister of labor, and Masao Tatsumi, a former senior executive of
the busiess information conglomerate Recruit Co.
   Tatsumi is accused of bribing Kato in 1986 to obtain favorable
treatment of Recruit by the ministry.
   Kato was among more than 150 senior bureaucrats, political
figures and businessmen who were offered bargain shares in
Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of Recruit, before the
company was listed.
   When the shares went on public sale, their value soard and Kato
made a profit estimated at about $56,000.
   Prosecutors have arrested 12 people so far, but released two
junior Recruit officials Tuesday and have yet to decide whether
formal charges will be filed against them.
   They say Kato, the highest-ranking public official held in the
scandal, influenced a Labor Ministry decision on publishing
employment information that was to Recruit's advantage. A
lower-ranking ministry official, Shigeru Kano, was arrested on
bribery charges last month.
   ``For Japan's civil servants, this spelled a most embarrassing
scandal that discredited them all in the eyes of the public,'' the
influential national newspaper Asahi said in an editorial.
   ``We wonder if (bureaucrats) are still able to really `serve' the
public at large. If their consciences are being clouded by bribes
and so much extravagance, they are betraying the public.''
   The Japanese generally have regarded senior civil servants as
officials of high integrity.
   Kato's arrest came two days after that of Hisashi Shinto, 78,
former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., the world's
largest company in terms of stock value.
   Shinto also is being held on bribery charges in connection with
alleged favorable treatment of Recruit by the giant
telecommunications utility.
   Takeshita's administration has been buffeted by the scandal since
the first reports of it last June.
   Three Cabinet ministers have resigned because of links to
Recruit, the governing Liberal Democratic Party has lost interim
elections and a storm surrounds political and corporate ethics.
   In Parliament, the boycotting Japan Socialist Party, Komeito
(Clean Government), Democratic Socialist Party and Japan Communist
Party said they also would insist Takeshita's predecessor as prime
minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, appear before a committee.
   Three Nakasone aides bought 29,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares in 1986
but he denies involvement in the Recruit affair.
   ``Without Nakasone appearing ... we cannot participate in the
session,'' said Shun Ohide of the Socialists, the main opposition
group.
   Takeshita has coupled his refusal to resign with repeated pledges
of political reform, but polls indicate a steady decline in his
public support.
   Yomiuri, Japan's largest newspaper, released a poll last week in
which only 21.3 percent of respondents said they supported the his
government, down 6.1 points from January. The January poll was the
first since Takeshita took office in November 1987 to show him with
an approval rating below 30 percent.

   The government announced today it is expelling a
group of Iranians ``on security grounds'' because of Iran's death
sentence against novelist Salman Rushdie.
   It also warned Britons living in Lebanon to leave, saying they
are under increased threat following Iran's severing of diplomatic
ties with Britain on Tuesday. Three Britons are held hostage in
Lebanon.
   The foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, announced the
expulsions in the House of Commons. Britain also ordered the closing
of the Iranian consulate in Hong Kong, a British colony, and gave
the staff two weeks to leave, Howe said.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up
to 30 Iranians will be ordered to leave Britain.
   Howe's comments came after an Iranian newspaper today said the
break in British-Iranian ties will adversely affect the British
hostages in Lebanon. Also today, a group holding two American
hostages said it has completed plans to kill Rushdie, whose new
book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' led to the break.
   Another Iranian newspaper said Tehran must also cut economic ties
with Britain and threaten other Western nations with the same action
unless they suppress ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some say
blasphemes Islam.
   Howe, noting Iran has refused to revoke its death sentence
against Rushdie, said: ``We have therefore decided on security
grounds a number of Iranians must be required to leave this
country.''
   ``We are keeping the activities of other Iranians under very
close review,'' he added. Howe said the expulsion orders would be
issued shortly. There are about 25,000 Iranians in Briton.
   One government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
those expelled ``will be people held to have close links with the
(Iranian)regime.'' Using his strongest language since the
controversy began, Howe called the Iranian government a ``deplorable
regime.''
   Responding to calls by legislators to ban trade with Iran, Howe
replied: ``We stand ready to take whatever action may be necessary
in the light of events.''
   In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization
said it has ``completed its preparations to execute the just
sentence issued by esteemed cleric and great struggler Ayatollah
Khomeini against Salman Rushdie.''
   Khomeini sentenced Rushdie to death Feb. 14. Rushdie was born
into a Moslem family in India and is a naturalized British citizen.
He has been in hiding since the death order.
   The statement, delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut, said
``the execution'' will be preceeded by attacks on British police.
The statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of hostage
Edward Austin Tracy, of Burlington, Vt., but it did not threaten the
hostages.
   The group also holds writer Joseph James Cicippio, 58, of Valley
Forge, Pa., who was acting comptroller of the American University of
Beirut when he was abducted.
   Iran's Kayhan International newspaper said of the Rushdie
controversy: ``The event will leave its negative impact on the fate
of the British hostages in Lebanon.''
   The British hostages are Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, 49;
journalist John McCarthy, 32; and Brian Keenan, 38, an
English-language teacher at the American University of Beirut. All
are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   The British Embassy in Beirut today advised Britons against
traveling to Lebanon and advised the estimated 125 already there to
leave. The warning was broadcast by Christian-controlled radio
stations.
   There are 15 hostages, including nine Americans, held in Lebanon.
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the hostage held longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985
and has been held longer than any hostage.
   Tehran's Farsi-language Abrar called for an end to economic ties
with Britain just one day after Iran announced the severing of
diplomatic relations.
   Kayhan International and Abrar both warned that Iran's relations
with other Western nations may be cut because of those countries'
support of Britain and their withdrawal of envoys from Tehran. Their
reports were carried by Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, which
is monitored in Nicosia.
   Iran in 1987 imported $528 million in goods from Britain. Iran's
exports to Britain that year totaled $321 million.
   Britain's 11 European Economic Community partners, as well as
Canada, Norway and Sweden, recalled their diplomats from Iran after
Khomeini ordered Rushdie killed. Only the Swedish envoys have
returned to Tehran.
   A trade ban would prevent European nations from winning lucrative
contracts to help Iran's reconstruction following its eight-year war
with Iraq. The cost of rebuilding has been estimated at up to $500
billion.
   IRNA quoted Abrar as saying: ``It is now up to the country's
political officials to remove the assumption of preserving economic
relations from the minds of London-dwellers, and warn other Western
countries against the consequences of enmity toward Islam and the
Islamic Republic.''
   Abrar concluded: ``British colonialism must taste its first
bitter experience of insulting the beliefs of more than 1 billion
Moslems in the world.''

   That fellow in Lubbock, Texas, was practicing
an old American tradition when he gave President Bush an earful on
how he was doing in the presidency.
   In Bush's case, the opinion was solicited by the president and
was welcome _ the Lubbock man told him ``things are going just
great,'' the president told the press on Tuesday. But the custom of
giving the government a piece of one's mind is older than the
country, and, more often than not, the petitions from the
countryside come bearing barbs.
   Or splinters. When the construction industry blamed Jimmy Carter
for high interest rates, builders mailed him foot-long two-by-fours
to drive home their protest. Read one: ``Please reread your 1976
campaign speeches. It's amazing how much you've forgotten in four
short years.''
   The National Archives reached into its storehouses of government
records to celebrate the practice of citizen telling government, or
telling government off. Among the examples on exhibit on the
archives' walls are some of those blunt two-by-fours addressed to
Carter.
   One lament that might sound familiar to Bush, as he replaces the
old Reagan guard with new Bush faces, was the petition Mary
Katherine Goodard wrote in 1789 in a failing attempt to remain
postmaster of Baltimore.
   ``She hath been discharged without the smallest imputations of
any fault, and without any previous notice whatever,'' her petititon
said. ``These are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years faithful
services, performed in the worst of times.''
   When the Bill of Rights gave the people the right ``to petition
the government for a redress of grievances,'' the founding fathers
were only accepting the status quo. The people of America had been
seeking redress long before there was a Constitution.
   In 1773, the governor of Connecticut protested to a member of
Parliament the closing of the port of Boston in retaliation for the
Boston Tea Party. He wrote, ``We are at a loss to conceive how the
destruction of the East India Company's tea could be a just or
reasonable ground for punishing so severely thousands of innocent
people.''
   A century later, Annie Davis, a slave from northern Maryland,
petitioned Abraham Lincoln with as urgent a question as ever
confronts humanity: ``You will please let me know if we are free.
...''
   And nearly a century after that, Earl Gideon put pencil to pad in
his cell in Bay County, Fla., and wrote a petition to the Supreme
Court that moved history.
   Gideon was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom. ``The
question is very simple,'' he wrote. ``I requested the court to
appoint me an attorney and the court refused.''
   The Supreme Court agreed and established the right of poor
defendants to be represented by lawyers, at the public expense if
need be.
   One of the biggest petitions ever to reach Washington remains as
it was received in 1893 _ rolled up on two huge wooden spools. It
consists of hundreds of sheets, taped together, bearing an estimated
150,000 signatures, appealing for the establishment of a federal
Road Department ``for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the art
of constructing and maintaining roads.''
   Congress took the hint, creating the Office of Road Inquiry in
the Department of Agriculture. Must have pleased the petition's
originator, a bicycle manufacturer, and his customers.
   Few citizens petitioning their government ever did so with more
charm than a grade schooler from Fair Lawn, N.J., who wrote to
President Ford after he pardoned President Nixon for the crimes of
Watergate:
   ``Dear President Ford,
   ``I think you are half right and half wrong.
   ``Yours truly,
   ``Anthony Ferreira.''

<TEXT>
   Dozens of Jewish women across the Soviet Union,
some joined by their children, launched a three-day hunger strike
Wednesday to protest what they say are arbitrary Kremlin policies
barring their emigration.
   Inside a small, dark apartment in a pre-fabricated Moscow
high-rise, 18 women and four of their children gathered to begin the
third annual hunger strike organized by a group called Jewish Women
Against Refusal.
   The date they chose for the beginning of their three-day fast was
symbolic: March 8 is International Women's Day in the Soviet Union,
a national holiday.
   The hunger strikers, who were packed into a modest living room,
said they feared the international popularity of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's reforms, known as ``perestroika,'' diverts attention
from their plight.
   ``We are very afraid now because the Soviet Union does everything
possible to attract attention to perestroika, and many people across
the world are deceived,'' said Judith Lurie of Moscow.
   ``It's true that many changes have taken place in this country _
but it's far from being a law-governed state,'' said Lurie, 46, who
has been refused an exit visa for 10 years.
   Lurie's family was given exit visas in 1979, but the authorites
revoked them on the grounds of state secrecy because her husband
worked in a classified job as a organic chemistry researcher for two
years in the 1960s, she said.
   At least 48 women and several children are taking part in the
hunger strike in nine cities, including Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Riga
and Irkutsk, said Inna Ioffe, whose apartment was one of two
gathering spots in Moscow for the hunger strikers.
   The women in her apartment shared the details of their cases,
dried each other's tears and wrote letters to first ladies Barbara
Bush and Raisa Gorbachev to ask their support.
   About half of the hunger strikers have been denied exit visas on
the grounds of secrecy, Ioffe said. The Soviets have told them they
cannot leave because they or a relative have been exposed to state
secrets, she said.
   The other half, known as ``poor relatives,'' have been denied
permission to leave because their parents or divorced spouses have
failed to certify they have no financial claims on the would-be
emigrants, she said.
   One hunger striker was joined in the fast by her twin 13-year-old
daughters. The family has not been allowed to emigrate to Israel
because the girls' father refuses to sign the necessary forms.
   ``Our former father cast us off when I was 5 years old. We
haven't seen him since, and he's absolutely uninterested in us. But
when Mom applied to emigrate, he called and said he loves us very
much,'' said Vicka Prilutskaya, one of the twins.
   ``Our father says while he lives he won't let us go,'' said the
teen-ager, who wore a Star of David around her neck and an Israeli
flag pin on her sweater.
   Tamara Gurfink, 56, sobbed as she told her story.
   ``My only son emigrated to New York and I haven't seen him in
nine years,'' said Gurfink, as she pulled two photos of her son out
of her wallet.
   ``I ask only to be allowed to go and be a guest of my son, but I
am refused,'' said Gurfink, who said she has not been allowed to
leave on the grounds of state secrecy.
   The participants said they hope the hunger strike will encourage
the international community to pressure Soviet leaders to write laws
forcing officials to deal with cases individually and be more just.
   Ioffe said she has been told she cannot emigrate because her
76-year-old mother-in-law, who also wants to emigrate, was exposed
to state secrets in her work as a botanist.
   More than 20,000 Soviet Jews were allowed permission to emigrate
in 1988, which was an eight-year high. The highest exodus, 51,328,
was recorded in 1979.
   It's difficult to estimate how many Soviet Jews have been denied
exit visas. The Council for Soviet Jewry, a group sponsored by the
Israeli government, estimates the number at 3,600.
   Yuri Semenovsky, denied an exit visa for three years, says 80,000
Soviet Jews had their applications for exit visas refused last year.
   And there are new refuseniks.
   Ira Khrustalova, 41, one of the hunger strikers, said she had
just received her notice of refusal Tuesday.
   ``These three hunger strikes have all been during the years of
perestroika,'' said Ioffe. ``Everyone talks a lot about all the
changes due to perestroika, but the situation in emigration is still
the same.''

   Jindo Corp., South Korea's biggest fur
coat producer, Wednesday said it is going into partnership with a
Soviet company to open a string of stores in the communist country.
   It would be the first business tie-up between the Soviet Union
and Western-leaning South Korea.
   Jindo officials said their company, which produces 400,000 fur
garments a year, signed a contract Tuesday in Moscow with Interlink
of the Soviet Union to set up an equally owned joint venture firm
with initial capital investment of $800,000.
   Their first goal is to open a store in Moscow.
   Jindo said it wants to open 10 more joint-venture stores in the
Soviet Union in the next two years.
   South Korea has sought business ties with the Soviet Union in
recent months, although the two nations have no diplomatic relations.

   The Louisiana Legislature's approval of
Gov. Buddy Roemer's tax increase plan sets up an April 29 vote on a
constitutional amendment to overhaul a system dating to the populist
Huey Long era.
   Legislators adopted the proposal Tuesday at a special session
Roemer called to address a projected budget shortfall of $654
million for the next fiscal year.
   State revenue has fallen sharply because of Louisiana's oil-bust
recesssion and its unemployment rate of more than 11 percent, the
nation's highest.
   Rep. David Duke, the former Klan leader recently elected as a
Republican from a New Orleans suburb, promised to lead opposition to
Roemer's program.
   ``I don't care what the American Nazi Party thinks about this
program,'' the governor responded. On Monday, Duke apologized to the
House for being photographed shaking hands with an official of the

   ``How can you dare not call this a tax increase?'' Duke shouted
at administration floor leaders during House debate. ``How can you
say that income taxes will be increased by $165 million and that's
not a massive tax increase?''
   The Roemer administration has depicted the plan as a reform
program providing a net increase in revenue of $25 million over
current levels. Current revenue includes a one-year, $500 million
sales tax increase, that expires June 30.
   The Roemer proposal would make much of that increase permanent,
along with some tax breaks and an increase in income taxes.
   Roemer's program also includes a 4-cent gasoline tax increase to
pay for a $1.5 billion improvement program for highways, airports
and ports.
   For both the highway improvement program and the tax code
revision to go into effect, a majority of voters must approve a
constitutional amendment April 29.
   Last year, Louisiana had to sell long-term bonds to pay off an
accumulated deficit of about $900 million.
   Roemer's initial attempt to revise the tax system failed before
the Legislature in October over his proposal to lower the state's
$75,000 homestead tax exemption. The governor did not touch the
exemption in his latest package.

   In a move approved by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, three members of the Palestine Liberation Organization
will be permitted to enter the United States to attend a conference
at Columbia University, the State Department said Wednesday.
   ``None of the three has any record of personal involvement in
terrorism,'' spokesman Charles E. Redman said in announcing the Bush
administration would waive a 1974 law that generally prohibits the
issuance of visas to the PLO based on a judgment that the
organization engages in terrorism.
   The Israeli Embassy reacted swiftly and negatively. ``We regret
the decision by the U.S. government to grant visas to
representatives of a terrorist organization and have expressed this
position to the administration,'' spokesman Yossi Gal said.
   The conference, scheduled Friday through Sunday in New York, is
sponsored by ``New Outlook,'' an Israeli magazine, and by the East
Jerusalem Palestinian newspaper ``Al Fajr.'' Several left-wing
members of the Israeli Knesset, or parliament, also are to attend.
   Redman said the State Department recommended issuance of the
visas to the three Palestinian Arabs, Nabil Sha'th, Noha Nicholas
Tadros and Afif Safyah, and that the Justice Department concurred.
He said Baker was ``involved'' in the recommendation.
   All three Palestinians have attended academic conference in the
past with U.S. permission, the spokesman said.
   Under the law being waived in this case, Yasser Arafat, chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was denied a visa last
year to participate in a Mideast debate at the United Nations. The
move, recommended by then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
evoked criticism from U.N. officials and Arab and West European
governments.
   That conference was shifted to Geneva where Arafat issued
statements urged on him by the State Department renouncing terrorism
in all forms, affirming Israel's right to exist and accepting U.N.
Security Council resolutions that all countries in the Middle East
should be able to live peacefully within secure borders.
   This led to a decision by Shultz and then-President Reagan in
December to drop a 13-year ban and open talks with the PLO. Five
meetings have been held in Tunisia with U.S. Ambassador Robert
Pelletreau.
   Three attacks by PLO guerrillas on Israeli positions in southern
Lebanon since then were sharply criticized by Baker and spokesman
Redman. In the meantime, the dialogue is being continued.

   Public opposition to building new nuclear power
plants is due mainly to ignorance of the nation's needs, not concern
about reactor accidents, a nuclear industry leader said Wednesday.
   Harold B. Finger, president of the U.S. Council for Energy
Awareness, made the comment, coincidentally, as officials at a North
Carolina nulear plant announced they had shut down a reactor after a
small amount of radioactive steam was released into the air.
   Officials at the McGuire nuclear plant, near Charlotte, declared
an ``alert'' _ the second-least serious of four emergency categories
_ and said the release of radioactivity was caused by a pipe leak.
They said there was no danger to the public.
   Finger, whose group promotes nuclear power, spoke at a news
conference to present a paper on the future of the industry. He said
that unless atomic plants are built in the 1990s the nation would
face electricity shortages.
   No orders to build nuclear reactors have been placed since 1978,
and some utility officials say it's unlikely any more plants will be
built in this century.
   While acknowledging ``there is a general concern about nuclear
energy'' among the public, Finger said the main reason people oppose
building nuclear plants in their area is doubt about the need for
more electrical generating capacity.
   ``The American public does not know we're headed into this period
of very serious electricity need,'' Finger said.
   Finger said the public's views on nuclear power are not
influenced greatly by publicity about accidents and safety
violations at atomic reactors, such as the shutdown of the two Peach
Bottom reactors in Pennsylvania in March 1987 after control room
workers were caught sleeping on the job.
   Environmental groups opposed to nuclear power point to incidents
such as Peach Bottom, and the less serious pipe leak at McGuire on
Wednesday, as reasons to expect the public to continue opposing the
building of new nuclear plants.
   ``These kinds of mishaps, some more serious than others, continue
to erode public confidence in commercial nuclear power plants,''
Scott Denman, director of the anti-nuclear Safe Energy Communication
Council, said in a telephone interview.
   Public opinion on nuclear power also has been hurt by recent
publicity about lax safety standards and environmental hazards at
Energy Department reactors that produce material for nuclear
weapons, said James J. O'Connor, chairman of Commonwealth Edison Co.
of Chicago. All of the government reactors have been shut down
temporarily because of safety, technical and managerial problems.

   Pope John Paul II encouraged U.S. Roman
Catholic bishops Wednesday to proclaim church teaching even if it is
unpopular. They responded that authoritarianism does not convince
Americans.
   The views were voiced at the start of a special four-day
conference of 35 American bishops the pontiff summoned to Rome.
   Dissent from church teaching in the United States has raised
concern in the Vatican, which considers the 52 million-member
American church critical because of its size, wealth and potential
to set worldwide trends.
   John Paul described the bishops as ``pillars'' who give the
church strength and the bishop's role is expected to dominate the 12
hours of discussions with top Vatican officials through Saturday.
   He spoke briefly in English to the prelates, who were gathered
with Vatican officials in the Old Synod Hall. The meeting was closed
but his remarks were made public.
   ``I wish to encourage you in your ministry,'' John Paul said. ``I
am fully conscious of the challenges you face in bringing the Gospel
message to a world that does not often readily accept it.
   ``Your people experience the difficulties of being Christians in
today's world. Yet at the same time they search for direction in
following the path marked out by Christ.''
   Responding to the pope, Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis,
president of the U.S. National Conference of Catholic Bishops, took
up the theme of American democracy raised earlier in the day by
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago.
   ``Authoritarianism is suspect in any area of learning or
culture'' in America, May said. ``Individual freedom is prized
supremely. Religious doctrine and moral teaching are widely judged
by these criteria.
   ``Therefore, to assert that there is a church teaching with
authority binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of
contradiction to many Americans who consider the divine right of
bishops as outmoded as the divine right of kings,'' he said.
``Accordingly, bishops live and work constantly in this atmosphere.''
   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, West German head of the powerful
Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, addressed the meeting on
the ``bishop as teacher of the faith.'' Cardinal John O'Connor of
New York was speaking on the issue for the Americans.
   Both sides emphasized the non-confrontional nature of the
meeting, but a conflict arose immediately over releasing speeches by
the bishops and officials public.
   Meetings of the U.S. church hierarchy in Washington are open to
the media and the Rev. Kenneth Doyle, spokesman for the bishops,
said:
   ``My impression is that the American bishops would have no
difficulty with having their presentations released to the press,
and in fact that is the way they are accustomed to functioning.''
   Vatican officials apparently were resisting the idea, however,
except for the opening addresses by John Paul and May.
   Other topics to be covered include the family, sacraments,
Christian education and the media.
   The Vatican has been troubled by dissent among Americans on such
issues as the church ban on contraception and remarriage for
divorced people. There also have been calls for women to be have a
greater role in church decision-making, but the pope has said
repeatedly that women cannot become priests.
   John Paul says people cannot dissent from church teaching and be
considered ``good Catholics,'' and during his 1987 visit to the
United States he challenged the bishops on the issue.
   At a news conference Wednesday, Bernardin said American
democratic freedoms are not ``in conflict with our faithfulness to
the universal, Catholic tradition that is ours.''
   ``Our experiences, like those of every national hierarchy, are
rooted in that dual reality: The Gospel which is universal and one
as proclaimed in a particular cultural and societal setting,''
Bernardin said.
   He said it is important to ``share these experiences'' with the
pope and his advisers, just as it is for the Americans to be aware
of ``their convictions and insights from the perspective of the
universal church.''

   On March 25, Ants Paju will mark the
40th anniversary of the day he was placed on a train as a boy and
deported to Siberia.
   The next day, the bearded 44-year-old journalist will stand
against a top official for the right to represent central Estonia in
a new parliament in Moscow.
   In the small Baltic republics, the cracks between Russians and
ethnic Balts and between the Communist Party and the reform-minded
People's Front are widening as the election draws near.
   Paju, editor of the nature magazine Eesti Loodus, is running
against the head of the Estonian state agricultural-industrial
complex, Gustav Tonspoeg, on a platform that mixes environmental and
economic issues with the spiritual renewal activists say is crucial
to the survival of tiny Estonia.
   ``The worse the internal state of people, the greater the
possibilities of doing terrible things to our environment,'' Paju
said in an interview.
   Paju is the son of an Estonian peasant who also was deported to
Siberia and died there after the Soviet Union took control of the
Baltic republic in 1940. He was put on a train with a woman he did
not know _ his mother was required to remain in Estonia _ and sent
to Siberia until after Josef Stalin died in 1953.
   Now he hopes to become a member of the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies, which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says must
help turn the Soviet Union into a nation governed by laws rather
than personal dictate.
   Estonia has gone further than Latvia and Lithuania in asserting
its independence from Moscow, declaring its sovereignty Nov. 16.
Although Moscow rejected that claim, the two sides have managed to
avoid an open conflict. However, Estonia has not backed down.
   Estonian activists say that in contrast to the other Baltic
republics, their Communist Party and government leadership strongly
support the grassroots People's Front political movement striving
for autonomy from Moscow.
   Candidates such as Paju and scientist Endel Littmaa, 58, have
appeared to push the People's Front's program.
   ``Without criticizing everything left and right, it's unlikely
you'll be elected,'' said Littmaa.
   Rifts have appeared between ethnic Estonians, who make up about
60 percent of the population, and Russians, who comprise the rest.
   Russians fear that decisions making Estonian the official
language, restoring the national flag of the Estonian republic, and
moves for economic self-sufficiency will make them second-class
citizens.
   Just as ethnic Estonians rallied around the People's Front,
Russians have joined a new organization called Interfront. The
newspaper Sovietskaya Estonia said that of the 742 delegates seated
for its organizing convention last weekend, 572 were Russians. Only
11 were ethnic Estonian.
   An Estonian journalist, Tarmu Tammerk, said the March 26
balloting is more likely to break down on ethnic lines than party
versus People's Front.
   Reports in Tallinn said Interfront was organizing a general
strike for March 14. The republic's reform-minded Communist Party
chief Vaino Vyalyas went on radio and television Tuesday to appeal
for calm and reject extremism.
   But Estonian activists pledge to fight on. A plan designed to
make state-run enterprises answer to Tallinn rather than Moscow
ministries is likely to come before the legislature this month. The
plan is called IME, an acronym that stands for Economic
Self-Government in Estonia, but also means ``miracle'' in Estonian.
   In the Latvian capital of Riga, Latvians and Russians also are
split, but the party apparatus led by Janis Vagris is wedged
uneasily between the two.
   Latvia has the highest concentration of Russians of any of the
Baltic republics, about 50 percent, and a twin of the Estonian
Interfront, the Inter-Nationalist Front, is active.
   Vagris criticized it and the Latvian People's Front in January.
``Both movements have some extremist-minded elements,'' he said.
``Both also involve members of the Communist Party, which means that
there is also stratification within the party.''
   Latvian activists accuse Vagris of tilting away from reforms by
permitting criticism in the local press of the Movement for the
National Independence of Latvia, a group that cooperates with the
People's Front but seeks outright independence. The party's Central
Committee also called for punishment of Latvian journalists for
muckracking pieces it said whip up ill-feelings between Latvians and
Russians.
   The Russian-language daily Sovietskaya Latvia said Tuesday that
90 percent of the 96 candidates for 40 seats in the March 26
election were party members.
   But that may be of little comfort to Vagris. The paper also said
75 percent of the candidates are ethnic Latvians, and People's Front
officials say roughly 75 percent support its aims.
   Lithuania's Sajudis, or People's Front, has come in for the
sharpest criticism from the Communist Party, which accused it last
month of crossing over from support for the party to clear
opposition in some cases.
   In a document dated Feb. 24, the grassroots organization said the
election campaign was making some party and economic officials
fearful for their posts and privileges.
   But it also moved to bolster the Lithuanian party leadership,
which it views as reform-minded.
   Alvydas Medalinskas, a top Sajudis spokesman, said the
organization had withdrawn candidates running against Lithuanian
party chief Algirdas Brazauskas and his deputy, Vladimir Beriozov,
leaving them unopposed. He said Sajudis wanted to strengthen them
against a ``Stalinist'' wing of the Lithuanian party.

   Former President Ford has written a letter
to friends of Oliver Sipple, saying he would ``forever be grateful''
to the ex-Marine who saved him from an assassin's bullet.
   Sipple, 47, was found dead of natural causes Feb. 2 in his
apartment. In 1975, Sipple grabbed Sara Jane Moore's gun hand when
she tried to shoot Ford outside a hotel, causing the shot to go
astray and hit a building.
   Sipple had shunned the publicity and was anguished that it
brought to light his homosexuality.
   Ford's letter was addressed to ``the friends of Oliver Sipple.''
It hangs on the wall of the New Belle Saloon, Sipple's favorite bar.
   ``I will forever be grateful for Oliver's action on my behalf at
the time of the assassination attempt by Sara Jane Moore in San
Francisco,'' the letter says.
   Moore pleaded guilty and is serving a life term in prison.

   Clint Holmes says his stint on the Fox
network's now-defunct ``The Late Show'' was marked by poor pay and
executives fighting to keep him off camera.
   The 35-year-old singer, who opens this weekend at Trump Castle
Hotel and Casino, said he took the job as off-camera announcer on
``The Late Show'' with Joan Rivers on the promise he eventually
would be co-host and sing on the program.
   ``But Fox wanted some blond-haired, blue-eyed pretty boy to play
off Joan's being ethnic,'' said Holmes, who is black. ``But Joan
fought for me. Finally I got it and came out on screen.''
   Appearing on the Los Angeles-based show five days a week reduced
Holmes' casino dates and cut into his pay, he said. ``I made no
bucks,'' Holmes said. ``Almost every Friday night I got on the
red-eye to do shows on the weekend.''
   Holmes stayed with the show after Ms. Rivers' departure before
the show was canceled last year.

   A prosecutor said she had not paid her lawyers.
   Holzer, 54, who produced or provided financial backing for such

was arraigned on charges of larceny and fraud. If convicted, she
faces up to 15 years in prison.
   Assistant District Attorney J. Christopher Prather said one of

``basically because they hadn't been paid.''
   Ms. Holzer was accused of defrauding investors in a bogus oil and
minerals scheme. She allegedly claimed to be married to banker David
Rockefeller and promised profits of up to 82 percent in as little as
90 days.
   Rockefeller does not know Ms. Holzer, Prather said.

<HEAD>Dropping Service from Budget Would Cut Deficit $2 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Top managers of the U.S. Postal Service have an
idea for lopping at least $2 billion off the federal deficit next
year _ remove the agency from the budget.
   ``If we stay `on budget,' it will increase the general deficit by
over $2 billion. Taking us off will avoid that,'' Robert Setrakian,
chairman of the agency's governing board, said Wednesday.
   ``The Postal Service does not belong in the unitary budget,''
agreed Postmaster General Anthony Frank at a jount meeting of two
subcommittees of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil
Service.
   Much of the House appears to agree, with committee members
reporting that they have more than 200 member signatures on a bill
to move the agency back out of the federal budget.
   ``I want to underscore the ... need for `off-budget''' status,
said Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y. The subcommittee chairmen, Reps.
Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., concurred.
   In pressing for removal from the general federal budget, the
Postal Service leaders appealed to the same logic that led to the
agency's being included in the overall budget during the Reagan
administration.
   Once a heavily subsidized Cabinet department, the Postal Service
was made an independent federal agency in 1971. The service's
subsidy was phased out and the agency was directed to operate like a
business _ breaking even over the long haul and having its own
budget.
   Over the years, the agency developed a pattern of operating at a
loss some years but making a profit in others _ depending on how
recently rates had gone up. But it did break even on average.
   This was noticed by Reagan's Office of Management and Budget and
in 1985 the post office _ which had a $117 million surplus the year
before _ was brought back into the federal budget in an effort to
make the national deficit appear smaller.
   The result, however, was that when the government found itself
battling a massive deficit last year cuts were imposed on agencies
including the Postal Service, forcing delays in construction and
closing down post offices across the country for a few days.
Collecting and sorting mail on Sundays has not yet been resumed
because of the budget crunch.
   The Postal Service is expected to complete the current fiscal
year about $600 million in the black, then fall into the red in
fiscal 1990 _ adding $2 billion or more to the federal deficit if
the agency isn't removed from the overall federal budget before then.
   Frank has said he anticipates having to raise postage rates in
1991 to cover that loss, although he commented at the hearing that
he would like to stretch out the currrent system of seeking
increases every three years. The last rate hike was in 1988.

   Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater was
portrayed Wednesday as a victim of the political symbolism of Willie
Horton, the black convict Atwater turned into a major issue against
Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign.
   Atwater resigned Tuesday night from the board of predominantly
black Howard University after students occupied the administration
building to protest his appointment.
   ``He masterminded the use of the Willie Horton issue to
contribute to the rising anti-black sentiment of the American
people,'' said Michael Lewis, a spokesman for the student group.
   The vehemence of the student reaction against Atwater raised
questions of how successful the new GOP chairman would be in
achieving his goal of attracting black voters to the Republican
Party.
   However, there also was a view that President Bush has a very
positive image among blacks, far more positive than that of his
party or its chairman.
   ``The Republican Party as a whole has a pretty big image problem
among blacks,'' said Linda F. Williams, an analyst with the Joint
Center for Political Studies, an independent group that focuses on
the black community.
   ``It is viewed as either not interested in the problems of blcks
or actually opposed to the advancement of blacks,'' she said.
   ``Bush has had a pretty long history with some black
leadership,'' said Ms. Williams. ``People are willing to see Bush as
a moderate.''
   The president was flying to New York on Thursday to be keynote
speaker at a United Negro College Fund banquet.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that
President Bush had ``no reaction'' to Atwater's decision to remove
himself from Howard's board of trustees, when he defended Atwater's
presence on the board.
   ``He hoped things would be worked out and they have been,''
Fitzwater said.
   Since becoming chairman of the Republican National Committee
early this year, Atwater, a South Carolina native who was Bush's
campaign manager, has met with scores of black leaders as he has
traveled around the country.
   He attended a commemorative service in Atlanta on the anniversary
of the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. An accomplished rhythm and
blues guitarist, Atwater also has received widespread publicity
performing with such black musicians as B. B. King.
   Not all blacks endorsed the action of the Howard students.
   Alan Keyes, who was the Republican candidate for the Senate in
Maryland in 1988, called the Howard protest ``an unjustified
reaction on the part of the students.''
   Keyes also disputed the contention that the Willie Horton ads
were racist.
   ``When I look at Willie Horton, I see a criminal, I don't see a
black person,'' he said.
   Horton was a convicted murderer who failed to return from a
weekend furlough from prison in Massachusetts and later raped a
Maryland woman. The Bush campaign used ads featuring the Horton case
to attack Democrat Dukakis as soft on crime.
   Many Democrats, including Jesse Jackson, protested during the
campaign that the Horton ads were racist.
   ``The signals that were sent in the Willie Horton ad were not so
much about (prison) furloughs, but about race inciting fears in
white people and creating very painful feelings among
African-Americans,'' Jackson said Wednesday.
   ``Unfortunately, Lee Atwater symbolizes the worst of that
situation,'' said Jackson who called Atwater Tuesday night and urged
him to resign from the board.
   In his letter of resignation, the GOP chairman said he wanted to
help the school, but ``continuing the controversy surrounding my
appointment any longer defeats that goal.''
   ``Today's events at Howard demonstrate the possibility that
someone could be injured in the protest,'' he said. ``That I could
not accept. I would never forgive myself if someone was hurt in one
of these episodes.''
   ``He feels this is an unjust situation,'' said Leslie Goodman, a
spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
   Michelle Stent, director of the Washington legislative office of
the United Negro College Fund, said, ``The college fund has a very
close and good relationship with the president and his family.''
   Emphasizing that she was speaking as an individual and not for
the fund, Ms. Stent said she could understand the students'
viewpoint ``because of the Willie Horton situation. ... I don't
agree with what Mr. Atwater did personally, but politics is politics
and he did what he had to do to win.''
   But, she added, ``Maybe students are bringing us back to reality,
that things have to be a little more honest.''

<HEAD>Soviet AIDS Cases Rising Fast; Health Minister Says Danger Ignored</HEAD>

   The Soviets are expressing alarm over the spread of
AIDS at home, with the health minister calling it a threat akin to
that posed by nuclear weapons.
   The number of cases in the Soviet Union is expected to rise
almost tenfold next year.
   As recently as 1987, Soviet officials dismissed AIDS as a largely
Western problem due to decadent sexual mores and drug use. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov called the disease ``a
scourge of God for the downfallen morals in our world.''
   But now, the daily newspaper Izvestia says, ``The alarming
situation with AIDS demands rapid and decisive measures.''
   ``A long time ago, some noted epidemiologists reported with
certainty that this new 20th century plague would pass us by,''
Izvestia said Tuesday. But the rapidly increasing number of Soviet
cases shows ``AIDS is not somewhere `over there, in their country,'
it is among our population,'' the paper said.
   ``The threat that we face is no less than the ecological `bomb'
or nuclear weapons,'' Health Minister Yevgeny Chazov was quoted by
Izvestia as telling a conference of Soviet epidemiologists convened
to discuss the disease.
   In 1988, Izvestia said, 81 people in the Soviet Union were
carriers of the AIDS virus. By Feb. 1, it said, 44 more cases were
known, and now the number of people infected exceeds 140.
   ``It's expected that next year, there will be 1,342 sick
people,'' Izvestia said, apparently referring to carriers of the
virus, rather than people actually suffering the symptoms of AIDS.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   Izvestia said that of four Soviets actually ill from AIDS, three
have died. The Soviet Union reported its first AIDS death in
October, a 29-year-old Leningrad prostitute.
   Izvestia quoted Chazov as telling the meeting that the Kremlin
ignored warnings that AIDS could become a national calamity.
   Chazov said Health Ministry workers tried many times ``to inform
the government that the situation was menacing,'' Izvestia said.
``But noted scientists dealing with the problem eliminated the
acuteness of the question, saying it was all a false alarm.''
   In articles that horrified many Soviets, newspapers reported in
January that children at a maternity home in Elitsa, near the
Caspian Sea, had been infected with AIDS because of the multiple use
of an unsterile syringe.
   Nurses at the hospital had been reusing disposable syringes to
cover up the sale of unused needles to drug addicts, the reports
said.
   So far, 31 infected children in Elitsa have been identified,
Izvestia said, and ``on average, one more is detected every week.''
   Just as Soviets are not any more immune to AIDS than Westerners,
some are also liable to treat its victims as pariahs, Izvestia said.
   ``It seems recently we read about `AIDS phobia' (the fear of
getting AIDS) in the U.S.A.,'' the paper said. ``We read, and we
shuddered: apparently normal, decent people were compelling a sick
person to leave town. They were burning down the house where he
lived ... We told ourselves then: Well, no, that's impossible here.
But things proved that it is possible.''
   In the area around Elitsa, people throw rocks at cars with
license plates from the region ``as if the cars were spreading
AIDS,'' Soviet poet David Kugultinov wrote in Izvestia last month.
Youngsters from the region are also being discriminated against, he
said.
   ``The relationship of students leaving Kalmykia to study in
neighboring republics has sharply changed, voices are calling out,
demanding to separate them from the dormitories,'' Kugultinov wrote.
   He said his country should follow the example of the United
States in seeking to prohibit discrimination against AIDS victims.
   In the past 1{ years, the Soviets have decreed measures designed
to counter the spread of AIDS. In 1987, it became a crime to infect
someone else. Regulations announced this year require foreigners who
want to stay in the country for more than three months to prove they
are free from AIDS.
   By Western standards, the Soviets, as of now, have only a small
problem with AIDS, if the figures published by Izvestia are
accurate. In comparison, the number of AIDS victims in the United
States had risen to 86,157 as of Feb. 16, the World Health
Organization said.

<TEXT>
   Victims of the Bhopal gas disaster
rampaged through Union Carbide Corp. offices Wednesday, and a human
chain surrounded the building screaming: ``Killer Carbide, quit
India!''
   Hundreds of other protesting victims squatted outside the Supreme
Court, which Wednesday began hearing a petition challenging the
government's right to settle on compensation for all victims of the
world's worst industrial accident.
   About 570,000 people say they are entitled to compensation for
the Dec. 3, 1984 gas leak at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in the
central town of Bhopal that killed at least 3,400 people and injured
20,000. Today, people still are dying from effects of the leak.
   About a dozen people broke away from the protest outside the
downtown New Delhi offices of the Danbury, Conn.-based multinational
Wednesday, and stormed into the reception area.
   They broke windows, smashed furniture and scrawled slogans on the
walls, said company spokesman Subramanium Kumaraswamy.
   About 140 demonstrators who formed a human chain around the
building yelled, ``We Will Not Allow UCC To Get Away With Murder!''
   The 10 employees in the reception area were unharmed during the
20-minute melee, Kumaraswamy said.
   Immediately, the company sought police protection.
   ``We have posted policemen all over,'' a police official said on
condition of anonymity. ``What happened will not happen now.''
   Protesters want the Supreme Court to scrap a $470 million
settlement agreed to by the government Feb. 14 as ``full and final''
compensation for all sufferers from the disaster.
   ``I am a gas victim,'' said a yellow paper badge on the sari of a
woman among 800 demonstrators who sat cross-legged in the parking
lot of the Supreme Court.
   The main gates of the court were locked and police and
paramilitary troops searched everyone entering the building.
   Inside, the court heard the petition of Charanlal Sahu, 51, a
Supreme Court lawyer who was in Bhopal at the time of the gas leak.
Sahu says his lungs and eyes still are affected by the exposure.
   His lawyer, R.K. Garg, argued the government's assumption of
power to act for all victims is a denial of the fundamental rights
to life and livelihood guaranteed by India's constitution.
   Garg argued passionately that the settlement ``challenged the
concept of India as a free nation.'' He said the government had
erred in not holding Union Carbide liable.
   Hearings continue Thursday before five judges, who must decide
whether they will admit the petition for review of the court's
judgment, which absolved Union Carbide of all civil and criminal
liability.
   Chief Justice Raghunandan S. Pathak appointed the judges last
week after one of five judges who ordered the Feb. 14 settlement
quit the panel because of widespread criticism of the agreement.
   Opposition politicians, newspapers, and prominent citizens have
accused the government of selling out to Union Carbide. The
government originally sued for $3 billion, then settled for $470
million.
   Union Carbide deposited the entire amount with the court Feb. 24.
It is being held until the court rules on the petition.

   Edward Powers, the FBI agent who helped
solve the 1950 $2.2 million Brinks armored car robbery and was
picked for his law enforcement background to manage the first modern
American lottery, has died at age 75.
   Powers died Tuesday in Fort Myers, Fla., where he moved in 1978
after retiring as director of the New Hampshire lottery. He had
undergone bypass surgery in 1979 and last year.
   The ``Handbook of U.S. Lottery Fundamentals,'' a 400-page
reference manual, recognizes Powers as the ``father of U.S.
lotteries.''
   He served as president of several national and international
lottery organizations. In his retirement, Powers was a consultant to
several state lotteries and companies that produce lottery
paraphernalia.
   Powers, as FBI agent in charge of the Boston office, spent six
years trying to solve the Brinks case. The break came when one of
the hold-up men informed on the others because he felt he didn't get
his fair share of the loot.
   In 1963, after 22 years with the FBI, he was hired to manage the
New Hampshire lottery because its sponsors wanted to prove it could
be run without organized crime influence.
   ``I remember opponents of the sweepstakes saying that the program
would create untold law enforcement problems and underworld
counterfeiting of tickets,'' he said in an interview shortly after
he retired.
   ``We proved them wrong. We proved a state can operate a lottery
with adequate controls and safeguards to protect the public's
interest.''
   As New Hampshire lottery director, Powers, who lived in Bedford,
was instrumental in lobbying Congress to repeal an excise tax on
lottery winnings and to allow radio and TV stations to broadcast
lottery numbers across state lines.
   The Chicago native graduated from Lawrence College in Appletown,
Wis., and Georgetown Law School in Washington.
   Survivors include his wife, Melva, two daughters and a son.
   Funeral arrangments were incomplete Wednesday.

   A man escaped from East Germany in a homemade
balloon Wednesday but fell to his death on the western side of the
Berlin Wall, police said.
   An East German passport bearing the photograph of the dead man
was found near the site where the balloon crashed, said West Berlin
police spokesman Dieter Piete.
   He said other documents found in the wreckage indicate a woman
also may have been aboard the balloon. Police searched the site for
other clues and urged residents to help in the search.
   Piete said residents in West Berlin's Zehlendorf district
reported seeing a balloon about 7:50 a.m. floating into the city
over the wall.
   Police found the balloon after it became snared in a tree. Piete
said the balloon, made of heavy plastic, had a harness attached to
it containing a man's leather jacket.
   A plastic bag containing a small radio, books and clothing was
tied to the harness, he said.
   After searching nearly eight hours, police found the body of a
man several hundred yards from the crash site and the passport of
32-year-old Winfried Freudenberg of East Germany.
   ``The picture in the passport matches up with the dead man,''
Piete said.
   On Sept. 16, 1979, eight people in a homemade hot air balloon
floated over East German border fences to West Germany, landing
safely near the village of Naila in northern Bavaria. The story of
that escape was later made into a movie.
   According to official West German figures, 78 people have died
trying to escape to West Berlin since East Germany's Communist
authorities built the Berlin Wall in August 1961.

<HEAD>Report Says Violence Against Women Worldwide Is Rampant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On an average day, thousands of women worldwide
are beaten in their homes by their partners. Thousands more are
raped, assaulted and sexually harassed.
   These startling estimates are set forth in a new report by
Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based research group, that
maintains violence against women is a pervasive yet largely ignored
problem that affects all societies and socioeconomic groups,
particularly in the Indian subcontinent and Africa.
   ``If a person is murdered because of his or her politics, the
world justifiably responds with outrage. But if a person is beaten
or allowed to die because she is female, the world dismisses it as
`cultural tradition,''' writes Lori Heise, a senior researcher at
the institute.
   Over the last generation, women in many countries have made long
strides towards achieving equality. These advances were highlighted
at many gatherings Wednesday on the occasion of the 79th annual
International Women's Day, a congressionally sanctioned observance
held each March 8.
   But, as Heise describes it, the observances were small comfort
for countless women for whom the mere fact of womanhood can pose
extraordinary risks. For them, ``Home, Sweet Home'' is a cruel
illusion.
   In the United States, says Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, as
many as 15 million women have been beaten, raped or suffered other
forms of physical and sexual assault, with the number rising by 1
million a year.
   As Hedy Nuriel, first vice chairman of the National Coalition of
Domestic Violence, put it: ``For many of us, it's safer to be out on
the streets than to be in our own homes.''
   Heise, writing in World Watch magazine, says that,
internationally, women tend to be targets because of their sex and
that the violence occurs ``without social remorse or protest.''
   ``Societies tacitly condone this violence through their silence
or, worse yet, legitimize it through laws, customs and court
opinions that blatantly discriminate against women,'' she says.
   During a parliamentary debate in Papua New Guinea on whether
wife-beating should be made illegal, one participant, Williami Wi,
was quoted as saying that the practice ``is an accepted custom ...
we are wasting our time debating the issue.''
   In India, Heise writes, countless women have died as a byproduct
of the system in which a bride's parents provide gifts to the groom
as part of a marriage settlement.
   Murder, suicide or severe abuse is sometimes the price young
brides pay if promised money or goods do not materialize, she says.
   For a woman in Bangladesh, said Ishrat Shamin of the University
of Dhaka, the choice is often between a violent home and none at all.
   In that country, ``separated, deserted or divorced women are
socially unacceptable,'' she observes, ``and remarriage is almost
impossible.''
   To remedy the problem of violence, Heise says, the most important
step women can take is to recognize oppression and act together
against it.
   ``Those battered or raped need to know they are not alone and
society needs to know the extent of women's victimization,'' she
says.
   ``Violence persists in part because it is hidden. If governments
and women's groups can expose its magnitude through surveys and
better statistics, then ignorance will no longer be an excuse for
inaction.''

<DATELINE>BEIT ARYE, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin vowed Wednesday to block illegal Jewish settlements in the
occupied lands after troops foiled attempts by right-wing activists
to settle two sites.
   In clashes with troops in the West Bank and occupied Gaza Strip,
20 Palestinians were shot, including a 13-year-old boy and a
75-year-old man, Arab hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed two of the injury reports and said it was
checking the others.
   The army blocked two groups of would-be settlers who set out for
the West Bank Tuesday night after a rally in Tel Aviv attended by
about 10,000 people.
   Eight activists from the right-wing Betar youth movement pitched
a tent on a hilltop about 15 miles east of Tel Aviv where the
settlement of Ofarim is to be built, said a Defense Ministry
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The activists pulled up stakes after soldiers told them to leave,
the official said. On Wednesday, soldiers guarding the site told
reporters it was a closed military area.
   Other would-be settlers drove three mobile homes from the rally
to the Beit Horon settlement north of Jerusalem, and said they
planned to move to the proposed new settlement of Talmon later in
the week.
   The Defense Ministry official said the group canceled its plans
after failing to receive government permits. But photographers said
troops stopped the group as it tried to drive to Talmon Tuesday
night.
   The government, a coalition of the right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-of-center Labor Party, authorized the construction of eight new
settlements, including Talmon and Ofarim, but has not granted final
approval.
   Labor, which favors some territorial concessions to resolve the
Arab-Israeli conflict, has tried to slow construction of settlements.
   In the past, the government has approved settlements erected
illegally.
   But Rabin, Labor's No. 2 leader, said: ``We will not allow any
settlements (other than) in accordance with the government decision
and a long procedure, which is set by the Ministry of Defense and
other ministries related to the problem.''
   About 70,000 Jewish settlers live alongside 1.7 million
Palestinians in more than 130 settlements in the occupied lands.
   The settlers want Israel to maintain its control over the
territories. Some claim the land was given by God to the people of
Israel in biblical times.
   The United States says the settlements are obstacles to peace and
opposes them.
   Palestinians staged a general strike Wednesday to mark the end of
the 15th month of their uprising against the Israeli occupation. The
rebellion has claimed 391 Palestinian and 17 Israeli lives.
   Streets were deserted and stores shuttered in compliance with the
strike call by the Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, an
umbrella group consisting mainly of PLO factions.
   In the West Bank town of Bir Zeit, outlawed Palestinian flags
fluttered from electricity poles, and Arab activists piled up stones
in the main road to block Palestinians from going to work.
   Palestinian women staged pro-PLO demonstrations in several towns
and villages to mark International Women's Day.
   About 600 women, including Israelis and Palestinians, marched
peacefully along a major shopping street in Tel Aviv, chanting
``Israel-Palestine'' and ``Rabin, how many children have you killed
today.''
   In Jerusalem, police dispersed about 60 Hebrew University
students who marched to the Isawiya neighborhood to show support for
the residents, Israel radio reported.
   Isawiya has been put under curfew while police search for
anti-Israeli activists. More than 30 Arabs had been arrested, the
radio said.

   Here, according to a Villers
Foundation-sponsored study, is how states were complying with the
Medicare catastrophic health expansion requiring them to use
Medicaid to pay Medicare premiums for poor beneficaries.
   The survey looked at various aspects of compliance, including
what the states were doing to notify elderly Americans in their
jurisdictions that they might be eligible for additional benefits.
   The study noted that the states were provided computer tapes from
the Social Seucrity Administration containing information on
Medicare beneficaries with income below $500 per month.

<TEXT>
   When composer Lee Hoiby watched a videotape of
television chef Julia Child whipping up ``a very special, ve-e-ery
choc'late-ly, bittersweet, loooovely cake,'' he knew he had the
recipe for a scrumptious musical treat.
   His 20-minute ode to Miss Child's chocolate cake, with lyrics
taken verbatim from the tape of a TV cooking lesson in 1961, had its
world premiere Wednesday at the Kennedy Center.
   The musical monologue, entitled ``Bon Appetit!'' after Miss
Child's familiar closing line, featured actress Jean Stapleton
singing her way around an imaginary kitchen, flouring cake pans and
beating egg whites in pantomime to Hoiby's piano accompaniment.
   ``Bon Appetit!'' was served up as the dessert course for an
evening of Hoiby's meat-and-potatoes classical fare. Then, at a
post-concert reception, the audience was invited to sample the real
thing _ Le Gateau au Chocolat, l'Eminence Brune _ prepared from Miss
Child's recipe by the Kennedy Center's head chef.
   Hoiby and Miss Stapleton will repeat their musical cake bake,
which is scored for small orchestra, during a festival of the
composer's music at Long Beach, Calif., later this month and at
Santa Fe, N.M., on April 9.
   Hoiby confessed that his work on ``Bon Appetit!'' was a severe
test of his commitment to a macrobiotic diet, which features such
ultra-healthy foods as cabbage, brown rice and fish with seaweed.
   ``I am tempted not only by the lyrics but by the cake itself,''
he said in a prerehearsal interview.
   ``I often give in to temptation and say I'll make up for it
later,'' he said. ``I love chocolate cake. The things that are out
of reach are what we love in this world.''
   The 63-year-old composer, who lives and works on a 40-acre farm
in the Catskills of New York state, wrote the piece as a
curtain-raiser for performances of a longer, operatic version of the
late Ruth Draper's monologue, ``The Italian Lesson,'' which he
composed for Miss Stapleton in 1984.
   Hoiby and associate Mark Shulgasser liked the idea of using the
script of a Julia Child cooking lesson, and had Miss Stapleton write
the TV chef for permission. She happily agreed, sent along a batch
of tapes and suggested her recipe for chicken Marengo.
   But Hoiby thought chocolate cake was a tastier choice.
   ``She gets pretty carried away about everything, but especially
this dessert,'' Hoiby said.
   During four full days of watching Miss Child's tapes, Hoiby was
intrigued by the ``rhapsodic phrases'' and musical metaphors in Miss
Child's speech as she banged pots, whisked egg yolks into a yellow
ribbon and poured out her creamy chocolate batter with a spatula.
   ``Her speaking patterns really grab you, the phraseology, the
unexpected little interjections,'' Hoiby said. ``There is a kind of
musical cadence in her speech which one isn't aware of unless one
starts to set it to music, and then there it is.''
   Miss Stapleton, a veteran of Broadway musicals who is better
known as Archie Bunker's wife, Edith, on the ``All in the Family''
TV series, agrees.
   ``What I love is her wonderful sense of theater,'' the actress
said of the chef. ``She's not just a cook. She's a character, very
rich and very humorous.''
   Miss Stapleton makes the most of Miss Child's comic touches,
tapping an invisible cake pan and instructing her audience to
``knock out the flour on the floor, if you have a self-cleaning
kitchen like mine.''
   The music accelerates when she beats egg whites in an unlined
copper bowl in a frantic race with an electric mixer. ``We're going
to see who wins,'' she sings, ``and I think maybe I'll win ...
because I'm bigger.''
   Next time _ if there is one _ Miss Stapleton says she'd like to
collaborate with Hoiby on the chicken recipe.
   ``Chickens are always funny,'' she said with a laugh.

<HEAD>Iran Says Five Soldiers Killed on Cease-fire Line in February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi ambush killed five Iranian
soldiers last month despite a cease-fire in the eight-year war
between the nations, Iran's U.N. ambassador said Wednesday.
   Also on Wednesday, a senior Iraqi foreign ministry official,
Riyad Al-Kassy, arrived at U.N. headquarters for discussions with
officials on coming peace talks between the foreign ministers of
Iran and Iraq.
   Iranian Ambassador Mohammed Ja'afar Mahallati said he learned of
the troop deaths from the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group,
which has monitored the cease-fire since it went into effect Aug. 20.
   U.N. Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, the chief
peacekeeper, received reports from his officers that ``five Iranian
soldiers had been shot in the back and killed'' Feb. 17, said U.N.
spokeswoman Nadia Younes.
   ``Iran said that they had been killed in an Iraqi ambush;
however, the investigation by (peacekeeping) observers could not
confirm this,'' she said.
   Mahallati discussed the deaths in a letter to Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar that said ``Iraqi forces ambushed our
patrols'' near Baneh, about 20 miles from the border and about 310
miles west of Tehran. A communications operator was captured,
Mahallati said.
   Perez de Cuellar reported Feb. 2 that the worst violence on the
740-mile front line occurred Dec. 11 in the southern border region
near the Shatt-al-Arab waterway dividing Iran and Iraq.
   Two Iranians were killed in that clash, which involved artillery,
rocket and small-arms fire.
   The armies are separated by only a few dozen yards in many
places, and in one spot face each other across 30 yards of desert,
Perez de Cuellar said last month.
   The only previous report of a fatality on the front came just
hours after the cease-fire took effect. Perez de Cuellar's report
did not confirm Iran's claim that Iraqi gunfire killed a soldier in
that case.
   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq have been deadlocked since they
began Aug. 25.
   They are to resume in New York in late March or early April with
a meeting of Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and his
Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz.
   Last week, Iranian foreign ministry officials met with U.N.
officials to present their views on the talks.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein proposed Sunday that the nations
exchange all 100,000 prisoners of war under the Geneva Convention,
which calls for the repatriation of prisoners after active
hostilities cease.
   The exchange would be separate from the peace talks to allow for
progress even if the negotiations remain deadlocked, he said.
   The talks became deadlocked when Iran demanded that Iraq withdraw
its troops from 260 square miles of Iranian territory.
   Iraq refused and countered that Iran must relinquish its right to
search ships in international waters for weapons bound for Iraq.
Iran has not searched any ships since the cease-fire took effect.

   Text of statement issued by the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, as translated from Arabic by The
Associated Press:
   In the name of the Almighty.
   After a thourough reading of ``The Satanic Verses'' book and its
contents that insult Islam and the Arab prophet, and after examining
the study of the so-called Salman Rushdie, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization declares that it has completed its preparations to
execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the
great struggler Ayatollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. Hence, it
puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence:
   1 _ Insulting Islam and the Arab prophet is an insult to the
latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary
Islam.
   2 _ Salman Rushdie's record indicates that he was a branch member
of the Freemasons' movement in England. Immediately after the
publication of his ``Satanic Verses'' book, he was promoted to full
official membership of the Freemasons' highest council in England
(or the church of organized atheism) which combats divine religions,
especially christianity and Islam and their great prophets.
   3 _ Imam Ayatollah Khomeini, with his acute awareness of the
grave consequences against the future of the divine religions
emanating from this Freemasonic and Zionist attack, has handed down
his verdict when the Arabs and those who claim to be the protectors
of Islam and speak for all the Moslems remained in tight silence.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares that before
taking any measures it will find itself compelled to attack British
police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order to get to
him to carry out the sentence. We hold the British government
responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the
British police and their posts that could result from the attacks on
them. This warning applies to all countries that are currently
negotiating with the British government to extend asylum and
protection to Rushdie.
   Victory to the oppressed,
   Glory and immortality to the martyrs.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization.

<HEAD>Bentsen To Vote For Tower Nomination</HEAD>

   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, announced today he
will vote to confirm former Texas Sen. John Tower as secretary of
defense but Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said he said he
still had the votes to defeat the nomination.
   Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic vice presidential candidate, became
the third Democratic senator to break party ranks and thow his
weight behind the embattled nominee.
   ``We have seen every imperfection in an essentially good man
dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights...,'' Bentsen
said. ``It has been a high price to pay for public service. I will
vote for John Tower's confirmation.''
   Mitchell told reporters earlier in the day that no matter what
decision Bentsen made, the Democrats ``still have ample votes to
reject confirmation.'' He urged Republicans to permit a swift vote,
but GOP Leader Bob Dole declared: ``We don't want to prolong the
debate _ we want to win.''
   Dole did not directly dispute Mitchell's claim. ``We're not
certain,'' he said. ``It's going to be a very close vote.''
   Bentsen, who served in the Senate with his fellow Texan, said he
was impressed with Tower's pledge not to drink if confirmed to head
the Pentagon.
   ``I doubt that John Tower could get by with putting an olive in a
glass of milk. The scrutiny of his life is going to be so intense
that he may wish he had never sought out this job,'' Bentsen said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who had been listed by some
Republicans as a potential swing vote, announced earlier that he
will vote against Tower because he has come to believe the
relationships Tower forged with defense contractors after leaving
government service pose ``at least the appearance of conflict of
interest.''
   ``In this case, I do believe it's in the nation's best interests
for the president to make another choice,'' Pell said.
   The Associated Press survey indicates 48 Democrats and Republican
Larry Pressler of South Dakota as either firmly opposed to the
nomination or leaning in that direction, and 40 Republicans and
three Democrats either firmly in favor or leaning that way.
   Dole, R-Kan., said he had talked by telephone earlier today with
President Bush, who continues to support Tower. He said he would
continue the effort to ``attract enough Republicans and Democrats to
support the nomination''
   Dole and Mitchell thus set the stage for a fifth day of debate on
the nomination, which has produced frayed tempers and unusual
personal outbursts on both sides of the struggle.
   ``I know this debate has been longer than most but this is
unprecedented. We don't want to prolong the debate _ we want to
win,'' Dole told reporters.
   Mitchell was asked if he is disturbed that the Senate may be
damaged by the debate's increasingly bitter and personal tone.
   ``Yes I am,'' he replied. ``I think the way to end it is to vote.
Letters are coming in saying, ``Enough is enough _ this has gone on
too long.''
   ``I believe enough time has been devoted to this matter,''
Mitchell said.
   Republicans now hope to convert other undecided Democrats,
concentrating their efforts on a handful of lawmakers. These include
Sens. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.; Charles Robb, D-Va., and Bennett
Johnston, D-La.
   Mitchell told the Senate today that the central focus of the
debate is the claim by Republicans that Tower should be approved
``because the president is entitled to have his own man.''
   But he said Tower himself, while serving in the Senate,
repeatedly voted against presidential nominees ``simply because he
disagreed with some of their positions.''
   Mitchell suggested many senators of both parties have reversed
position on the proper stance to take on nominees because of the
shift of the political winds.
   ``I predict that if ever and when there is a Democratic president
they (Republicans) will reverse position again,'' he said.
   ``Do not get locked into your present views,'' Mitchell said.
``You may be holding another view very soon.''
   At the White House, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the deputy GOP
leader, said after a meeting with Bush that an ``excellent
opportunity'' remains to pick up the Democratic votes needed to push
the nomination over the top.
   ``There isn't any question in my mind that we indeed have the
opportunity to get him confirmed,'' Simpson told reporters.
   Dole left open the possibility of asking the Senate to permit
Tower to answer the allegations against him from the floor of the
chamber.
   But Democrats said that would set ``an awful precedent'' for
future confirmation battles and Dole appeared to concede he would
make that move only as a last resort.
   Mitchell called it a ``desperation tactic.''
   ``I do believe enough is enough,'' he said. ``Why will the
proponents of the nomination not permit a vote?''
   Democrats control the Senate by a 55-45 margin.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., recalling Tower's
vote against the Senate censure of his father for improper use of
campaign funds 22 years ago, said he would vote for confirmation.
   Dodd said that although he and his family will be ``eternally
grateful'' for Tower's defense of the late Sen. Tom Dodd, D-Conn.,
his decision did not rest on personal considerations.
   He said that reading the file of the FBI investigation into
Tower's past, he believes evidence is too thin to support a vote to
bar the former Texas senator from becoming defense secretary.
   That evidence involves allegations _ many of them disputed _ that
Tower drank excessively, displayed improper behavior toward women
and permitted the appearance of conflict of interest to develop in
the lucrative links he forged with giant defense contractors after
leaving government service.
   Dodd's decision to support Tower follows that of Sen. Howell
Heflin, D-Ala. Together they dilute what had been a solid party line
split for and against the nomination.

   Private, non-profit development groups based in
poor communities appear to have created or saved almost 90,000 jobs
in the last five years, according to a survey of those groups by
their association released Wednesday.
   The groups have multiplied rapidly from their beginnings in the
1960s and have grown from 200 or so in the mid-1970s to probably
1,500 to 2,000 today, said the National Congress for Community
Economic Development.
   More than 800 groups participated in the congressional survey,
the first of its kind, which was completed late last year.
   Altough found in all states, these ``community-based development
organizations'' are particularly active where they may receive state
assistance, notably in California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York,
Ohio and Pennsylvania.
   Many groups concentrate on housing for the poor; 458 reported
completing more than 23,000 housing units in 1986 and 1987.
   The organizations reported lending money to 2,048 enterprises,
owning shares in 218 and operating 427 they owned. Most loans and
share investments were for less than $25,000.
   Responding groups reported development of 16.4 million square
feet of retail space, offices, factories and other facilities in
poor communities.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of 35 nations ended a
three-day meeting Wednesday and stressed that a new round of arms
talks should focus on increasing trust as well as reducing weapons.
   The talks opening Thursday could clear Europe of many of the
troops and conventional weapons massed between the Atlantic and the
Urals in the four decades since the Cold War.
   NATO proposed the talks focus first on imbalances and reductions
in tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers. It says the
Warsaw Pact has a 2-1 edge in such weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze proposed broader
talks, saying he wants existing imbalances removed and then a 10
percent to 15 percent cut in troops and all kinds of weaponry,
including combat airplanes, over the next two to three years.
   Yugoslavia, which is not a member of either military bloc, on
Wednesday backed Shevardnadze's proposal.
   NATO says it wants to focus first on the tanks and other weapons
that could be used in a surprise land attack.
   Shevardnadze on Monday proposed huge cuts in troops and weapons
and further talks to strip the continent of battlefield nuclear
rockets.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other Western
officials rejected the Soviet suggestion, hinting they viewed it as
a ploy t
interrupted supply lines, he said.
   The wage deferral was approved by more than 80 percent of
employees, an action that Gillette said indicated strong faith in
the future of the business. A wage increase scheduled to take effect
next fall also will be deferred. The plan calls for the workers to
get half of their deferred wages back in December, and the other
half is to be returned next February.
   The Company Store mails about 25 million catalogs annually,
employs more than 1,000 workers in its busy season, and had 1988
income of about $100 million.

<HEAD>Eds: Updates with State denial, congressman's letter to Bush in top

   The State Department said Wednesday it has no
evidence a Japanese aerospace company installed equipment at a
suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant, while President Bush's
spokesman said ``all aspects'' of the plant are being investigated.
   The Detroit News had reported that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
had a team of 50 technicians and engineers at the complex in the
desert south of Tripoli.
   The company is also involved in a proposed joint venture with the
United States to build a jet fighter, the ``FSX.'' The deal was
negotiated during the Reagan administration and is now under review
by the Bush administration _ with a decision imminent.
   Despite the State Department denial, the report on alleged
involvement by the Japanese company in Libya raised new concerns in
Congress about the proposed joint venture. And an administration
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
although indications earlier in the week appeared to favor U.S.
approval of the jet fighter project, within the past few days
prospects had become ``very fluid.''
   As a result, a final recommendation by the Defense Department and
Commerce Department to President Bush may not be ready by a Friday
deadline suggested by the White House, the official said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters that
news stories of a Japanese company being involved with the Libyan
plant surfaced last summer and that the Japanese government informed
American authorities at the time that it had received assurances
further Japanese involvement was not contemplated.
   Those assurances are still valid, Redman said.
   Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said the administration is investigating ``all aspects'' of the
plant.
   Fitzwater, while declining to comment directly on the story, said
the plant is ``the matter of the utmost concern to the United States
and we have raised it in any number of forums.''
   Meanwhile, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., a member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee and a critic of the proposed joint venture
with Mitsubishi, called for Bush to delay his decision.
   ``In light of recent press allegations ... we strongly urge that
the decision on the plan to sell technology to Mitsubishi for the
development of the FSX aircraft be put on hold until this new matter
is thoroughly investigated,'' Levine said in a letter to Bush.
   ``If Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was in fact involved in the
chemical weapons facility, it would raise very serious questions
about proceeding with the FSX agreement under which billions of
dollars of sensitive American defense technology would be
transferred to Mitsubishi,'' Levine said.
   The Detroit News, quoting unidentified congressional and Defense
Department sources, said Japanese experts had installed
metal-machining equipment used to make bomb canisters for poison gas.
   Fitzwater said the matter was raised briefly during a morning
meeting between Bush and congressional Republican leaders.
   ``It is being looked into from all aspects by our intelligence
services and investigative bodies,'' Fitzwater said. He said so far
the investigations had yielded ``no conclusions we're willing to
discuss at this point.''
   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is also involved in a proposed joint
venture with the United States to build a jet fighter, the so-called
FSX. The venture was negotiated during the Reagan administration and
is now under review by the Bush administration _ with a decision
imminent.
   Fitzwater, asked whether the new allegations would affect a
presidential decision on the FSX project, said only that Bush had
not yet made a final decision on the project.
   Under the agreement, General Dynamics of the United States and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would join forces to build the jet
fighters, a version of the F-16.
   Critics in Congress have labeled the project an $8 billion
giveaway of U.S. high technology and have called on Bush to cancel
U.S. participation.
   The Japanese government says it needs a final go-ahead from the
United States by March 31 to get funds for the project into its
current budget.
   Congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that the administration has been expected to give the project
the go-ahead, but with some safeguards to make sure that sensitive
U.S. weapons technology is not transferred to the Japanese.
   The Detroit News story said that the CIA briefed members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Mitsubishi-Libyan
connection during a closed-door meeting last week.

<TEXT>
   The president of the Steelworkers union and a
steel executive called Wednesday for extending steel-import
restraints, while a group of steel users called the curbs ``the
worst possible form of protectionism.''
   A debate sponsored by the private Economic Policy Institute
brought together advocates and opponents of America's five-year
``voluntary restraint'' program, which was negotiated by the Reagan
administration in 1984 and limits steel imports from 19 countries
and the European Community.
   The import curbs expire Sept. 30.
   President Bush pledged just before he was elected to continue the
restraints in some form. But opponents of the plan believe they can
make a case for ending it, or at least shortening the extension to
less than five years and reducing its scope.
   There was no argument at Wednesday's debate that the annual,
product-by-product, country-by-country import ceilings have aided
the steel industry's revival. Imports have been reduced to about 20
percent of the U.S. market, and employment and profits were up last
year over 1987.
   The issue is whether the restraints are still necessary, and to
what degree they have harmed other sectors of the American economy.
   Patrick Thompson, chairman of a coalition of 1,000 manufacturers
that rely on steel products, said the curbs have meant higher steel
prices and poorer product availability.
   ``Instead of growth and profitability through competitiveness,
our steel industry has a `circle-the-wagon' strategy of limiting
supply through trade protection in order to raise prices,'' said
Thompson, president of Trans-Matic Inc. of Holland, Mich.
   But Thomas Graham, president of the steel division of USX Corp.,
said most of his company's customers accept the need for continued
import protection.
   ``If we lacked customer support, believe me, we wouldn't be
here,'' Graham said. ``Ninety-five percent of our customers are with
us.''
   The U.S. industry says it lost $11.6 billion from 1982 to 1986.
   The problem, Steelworkers President Lynn Williams said, is that
the conditions that spawned the restraints _ large subsidies by
overseas governments to support steel firms _ have not changed.
   ``Just as we begin to catch up _ and we're a long way _ the worst
thing in the world would be to choke off this growth,'' he said.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission has been investigating
the effect of the ceilings on U.S. steel-consuming industries. Its
report later this year is expected to be an important part of the
debate over whether the administration should keep the program
intact in its present form.

<HEAD>Teacher Files for Annulment From Soviet Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teacher who fought nine years to win her
fiance's release from the Soviet Union has filed for annulment after
nine months of marriage, alleging he used her simply to get into the
United States.
   Elizabeth Condon, a high school language teacher, and Viktor M.
Novikov, had been reunited on the eve of the 1988 Reagan-Gorbachev
superpower summit.
   Condon, 45, met Novikov, 56, in 1967 while studying in the Soviet
Union.
   She returned to visit him and they made plans to marry, but
Soviet officials refused to let Novikov leave. In 1979, Condon began
lobbying for his release by writing letters and contacting
politicians.
   They were married May 28 in a backyard ceremony to the strains of
``Lara's Theme'' from the movie ``Dr. Zhivago.'' They exchanged vows
in Russian.
   Condon filed a complaint Feb. 3 in Essex Probate Court in Salem,
alleging Novikov encouraged her love and attention because he wanted
to leave the Soviet Union. The complaint also said the marriage was
never consummated.
   Condon, who teaches at Woburn High School, moved Novikov into the
four-bedroom home she shares with her mother. Novikov, a chemist,
began taking English lessons in an effort to begin practicing his
profession.
   But Novikov moved out Jan. 22 into the home of his wife's
brother, according to The Daily Evening Item of Lynn. The newspaper
reported that Condon was upset that Novikov did not contribute to
household expenses.
   Condon has asked the court to declare the marriage annulled,
which would return Novikov to his former status as an alien.
   Federal immigration officials said Novikov could be in trouble if
it's found that he entered the country fraudulently.
   ``He could be deported,'' said Timothy Whelan, Boston deputy
director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``It's not
that automatic and there's a process to be followed, but that's
grounds for deportment.''
   Condon did not immediately return a call to her school Wednesday.
No telephone listing was available for her brother's home.
   When contacted by the Item on Wednesday, Condon said: ``I don't
know why you are calling about this. I am late to school. It is
snowing outside. I have no comment.''

<HEAD>Central Americans Using Smugglers to Sneak Into the United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Central Americans fleeing their war-torn
homelands have begun using smugglers to take them deep into the
United States to evade tighter rules and heavier border patrols,
officials said Wednesday.
   Other refugees, out of money for bribes and payments, say they
can only wait and hope the U.S. crackdown that began Feb. 21 will
ease.
   ``There's been a large increase in smuggling people,'' said Juan
A. Garcia, assistant chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in McAllen,
Texas. ``They've resorted to going through smugglers to see if
they're able to get them farther into the United States.''
   David Trevino, a supervisor of the Border Patrol's intelligence
unit, said there are 1,500 to 2,000 Central Americans on the Mexican
side of the border waiting to cross, up from 200 to 300 before the
new policy went into effect.
   Until Feb. 21, refugees could enter the United States at
Brownsville, Texas, the nearest U.S. point to Central America. Most
applied for political asylum and lived in the United States until
their status was determined.
   But the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said most
refugees have experienced economic hardship and need not fear
political persecution. In an effort to stem the flow, the INS began
interviewing refugees as soon as they crossed the border.
   In the first week, the agency granted only 16 of 370 petitions
for asylum, and detained the others pending deportation proceedings.
   The result was a backup in this town just south of Brownsville on
the Rio Grande, as some Central Americans fled the threat of
detention in the United States and others searched for a new, and
illegal, way across the border.
   Trevino said smuggling cases detected in the area have doubled
from four to eight a day. Most of the refugees are trying to reach
Houston, from which they can travel to other parts of the United
States.
   ``A lot them are transported to just before a checkpoint and
dropped off. They walk around the checkpoint and are picked up on
the other side,'' Garcia said. The checkpoints are surrounded by
farmland, and Garcia said it's impossible to monitor all the river
crossings.
   Meanwhile, many Central Americans said that while crossing the
river has become tougher, paying smugglers to take them to other
crossing points or further into the United States is not an option.
   ``We came and we've found that we can't get in, that there are
new laws and now we're trapped here without money and we can't
cross,'' said Margarita Saavedra, 45, a Nicaraguan at the Casa Juan
Diego, a Roman Catholic-run shelter for the poor.
   She said she had been waiting 13 days with her 80-year-old
mother. They tried paying a smuggler $30, but the ``coyote''
abandoned them on a riverbank outside Matamoros.
   ``If we can, we'll try again. If not, we'll go back to
Guatemala,'' where they went after they first left Nicaragua, said
her mother, Angela Pena.
   A Nicaraguan woman named Yolanda, who refused to give her last
name, said she fled for several reasons. She said she wasn't being
paid enough for long hours at a child welfare center and was being
harassed because of her friendship with a rebel leader fighting
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   She left her husband and two children behind, but took her
12-year-old son along because he is close to draft age.
   A shelter worker said the shelter's population had shot up to 60,
all but three Central Americans, in recent days.
   ``They are waiting for a better time to pass when there is less
surveillance,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said 40 to 50 people also left the shelter this week, saying
they were going home. Mexican immigration authorities were not
bothering the Central Americans, he said.
   At a small hotel in Matamoros, a 31-year-old Mexican who
frequently takes people across the border said he was finding it
``very, very difficult.''
   The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the group of a
dozen with him were all Mexicans; however, members of the group
spoke with Central American accents and a hotel worker said they
were Hondurans.
   Many Central Americans identify themselves as Mexicans so they
will be returned to Mexico and not be deported to their homelands.
   The group said it was down to its last $1.50. Asked about other
border points, such as Tijuana, 2,000 miles away in Baja, Calif.,
the Mexican said:
   ``You know what it would cost to go to Tijuana? 110,000 pesos,''
about $47. He said he prefers taking people across in Brownsville
because it's closer to jobs in the eastern United States.
   ``We're going to wait to see if they go to sleep,'' he said of
the Border Patrol. ``And if not we're going to cross and maybe
they'll catch us.''

   A German physicist and a pathbreaking Scottish
minister were named as 1989 co-winners Wednesday of the world's most
valuable prize, the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion.
   The prize this year is $435,000. It was the first time the prize
has been divided between two winners. A spokesman said judges split
in this 17th year of the award.
   Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker, 76, of Starnberg, Germany, near
Munich, was cited for initiating talks between scientists and
religious scholars and for research into links between physics,
cosmology and theology.
   The Rev. George McLeod, 92, of Edinburgh, Scotland, was named for
his founding of the Iona Community, an ecumenical center of prayer,
peacemaking and work.
   The winners were announced at the Church Center for the United
Nations. The prizes will be presented privately at Buckingham Palace
in London May 10 and publicly in Tokyo on June 10.
   In statements, McLeod said he would ``use half of the money for
direct action against hunger and the other half for work for
peace.'' Von Weizsaecker said his share would go to furthering
relationships between science and faith.
   The founder of the prize, American investment counselor John M.
Templeton, said the international panel of judges picks winners on
the basis of their originality in advancing the ``love and
understanding of God.''
   He said the prize is deliberately kept larger than others, such
as the Nobel prizes in science and literature, to indicate that
``progress in religion is more important than progress in any other
field.''
   ``The accelerating discovery rate in natural sciences needs to be
matched by man's spiritual progess and discovery,'' he said.
   Von Weizaecker, credited for several discoveries in nuclear
physics, initiated talks in 1949 at the University of Gottingen
between long-hostile disciplines of science and religion and later
at other institutions.
   McLeod, a Church of Scotland clergyman, started the innovative
Iona Community on an island off the west coast of Scotland in 1938
and it has since become a much-visited and influential center.
   For its monastic-type discipline, McLeod set a simple, five-fold
rule of daily prayer and Scripture study, tithing, peacemaking and
responsible work and service.

<HEAD>US Criticizes Chinese Use of Force Against Tibetans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed concern
Wednesday about the continued violence in Tibet and criticized the
Chinese government's use of force against pro-independence
demonstrators.
   ``While we recognize the right of a government to maintain order,
we object to the unwarranted use of lethal force,'' said spokesman
Charles E. Redman.
   After three days of anti-Chinese rioting, official reports have
put the death toll in the violence at 12. But Tibetans say far more
have been killed, most shot to death by security forces.
   The unrest, the latest in an 18-month series of demonstrations,
has developed into the most serious challenge to Chinese rule in
nearly three decades.
   Thousands of Chinese troops have converged on Lhasa, the remote
Tibetan city where martial law was declared Tuesday after three days
of anti-Chinese rioting.
   The disturbances began on Sunday, when demonstrators protesting
Chinese rule began rioting, stoning police and building bonfires of
goods looted from Chinese-owned stores.
   Redman, asked about the State Department's reaction, noted that
he has spoken on the matter several times recently.
   He said the U.S. government had approached the Chinese Foreign
Ministry and its State Nationalities Affairs Commission about the
problem.
   ``We stressed a concern in the United States over human rights in
Tibet, deplored the violence which has led to many deaths and
injuries, and asked for an assessment of developments in Tibet and
the likely duration of martial law,'' Redman said. ``While we
recognize the right of a government to maintain order, we object to
unwarranted use of lethal force.''

<HEAD>Western Donors Urge Sudan to Stop War; Canada Threatens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western donors Wednesday urged the
government to end a six-year civil war threatening thousands with
starvation, and Canada said it will halt economic aid unless the
government starts peace talks.
   Apparently responding to those and internal pressures, Prime
Minister Sadek Mahdi on Wednesday sent his interior minister,
Mubarak Fadil Mahdi, to Ethiopia for talks with the southern rebels.
   But the move is unlikely to produce results. The Sudan People's
Liberation Army refused to talk to Fadil Mahdi on a recent similar
mission because they maintain the government first must endorse a
tentative peace agreement reached Nov. 16.
   Earlier Wednesday, Mahdi told a conference in Khartoum that his
government welcomes a United Nations call for a month's cease-fire
to permit delivery of emergency relief to more than 2 million people
facing starvation in rebel- and government-held parts of southern
Sudan.
   ``The problem is whether we can get the other side to accept this
temporary stop for relief efforts,'' Mahdi said.
   He was speaking at a U.N. conference of Western donor countries
and relief agencies organizing the $137.7 million emergency
operation.
   So far $45 million has been pledged for food and medication
mostly available in Sudan.
   The U.N. operation aims at a massive deployment by air, trains,
trucks and Nile River barges to get to 165,000 tons of relief
supplies in the south before the rainy season starts in May and
isolates the area for at least six months.
   The rebels, who want the mostly Moslem government to grant
political and economic reforms to the predominantly Christian and
animist south, have hampered relief efforts by attacking planes and
trains escorted by military personnel.
   The United Nations says 100,000 people could die if the operation
fails. Other relief officials say it could be 600,000.
   Last year, at least 250,000 southerners died, many isolated by
the rainy season.
   Canadian Ambassador Frances Miles Filleul spoke bluntly at the
opening of the two-day Conference for Donor Countries and
Organizations for Emergency Relief Operations.
   ``In absence of a settlement and national reconciliation, we will
reconsider continuing our other assistance,'' he said, emphasizing
Canada would continue humanitarian aid.
   Filleul criticized the Sudanese government for failing to carry
through on a peace proposal negotiated in November between the
rebels and the Democratic Unionist Party, then senior coalition
partner in Mahdi's government.
   Later, he told reporters Canada would cut its economic aid unless
the government took steps toward peace. Canada budgeted $56 million
for Sudan this year, $37.5 million of it in emergency humanitarian
aid.
   Japan, the United States and the European Community Japan were
among other participants that pledged to maintain humanitarian aid
to Sudan, but did not refer to economic assistance.
   The United States halted economic aid to Khartoum in January 1988
because the government owed $74 million in arrears on military and
economic debts, according to Julia Taft, director of the U.S.
government's foreign disaster assistance program. Humanitarian aid
amounting to $62 million was maintained between February 1988 and
February 1989, she said.
   ``There will never be an end to the suffering until there is
peace,'' Taft said.
   Mahdi emphatically denied his government was using food as a
weapon in the conflict, an accusation also leveled at the rebels.
   ``We want to dispel this wicked image of the government using
food as weapons and being callous to the needs of its civilians''
said Mahdi.
   In a related development, U.N. officials in Uganda said a cargo
plane failed to arrive Wednesday in Entebbe, delaying the start of a
major airlift of food to the besieged southern Sudanese town of Juba.
   Peter Matheson of the World Food Program said a C-130 Hercules
chartered from the Southern Air Transport Co. of Miami, Fla.,
apparently was having technical difficulties.

<HEAD>Mideast Conference Participants Say US-PLO Dialogue off to Slow Start</HEAD>

   Participants in an interfaith conference on the
Middle East said Wednesday the dialogue between the United States
and the Palestine Liberation Organization is off to a slow start but
has given impetus to the idea of a Palestinian state.
   ``It is self-evident that there hasn't been much of a dialogue,''
said Rita Hauser, an international attorney who played a role in
encouraging the United States to talk with PLO leaders.
   She said none of the discussions between the United States and
the PLO have been ``substantive.''
   ``This has given a great deal of concern to many of us because
obviously the PLO is getting very frustrated as are other people,''
she said.
   The Bush administration has said that its policy on the Middle
East is under review. In December, the Reagan administration decided
to drop a 13-year ban and open talks with the PLO. Five meetings
have been held in Tunisia with U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.
   Ms. Hauser said she believes the United States government has
``signaled that it is not prepared to renounce the dialogue'' and is
engaged in ``a fairly nuanced and sophisticated approach to the
question in anticipation of a substantive dialogue.''
   Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a professor of religion at Dartmouth
College, agreed that the contact with the PLO has been ``modest,''
but declared, that ``no matter what may happen to it as diplomatic
games of one kind or another are played, once the United States has
met with the PLO, a Palestinian state exists.''
   ``When it will exist is a question of time, but the meeting with
the PLO has to be understood in historic context as accepting the
proposition on the American side that there is a national movement
called the Palestinians and that the PLO are the people to talk
with.''
   The two-day conference, involving Christians, Jews and Moslems,
is sponsored by the U.S. Interreligious Committee for Peace in the
Middle East.
   In a statement, the committee said it supports ``the Palestinian
people's right of self-determination, including the option of an
independent state in the West Bank and Gaza pledged to live in peace
with Israel.''
   A rival group, the Jewish Committee on the Middle East, handed
out a flier at the meeting saying that none of its members had been
invited to participate although Hertzberg and others who it said
oppose its positions were among the speakers.
   The Jewish Committee on the Middle East said it favors an end to
``huge economic and military subsidies'' of Israel by the United
States. It also said it is for ``mutual recognition between Israel
and the new State of Palestine.''

   The Bush administration on Wednesday defended
its decision to bar mayors from Panama, Cuba and Nicaragua from
attending a drug conference in New York, saying none of these
countries can be counted on to cooperate in drug control efforts.
   The conference opened Wednesday without the presence of the
mayors of Panama City, Havana and Managua.
   ``The Americas Mayors' Conference: Drugs and Traffic'' will run
through Friday, with daily panel discussions on various aspects of
the drug problem. It is co-chaired by New York Mayor Edward I. and
Mayor Andres Pastrana of Bogota, Colombia.
   Koch criticized the administration's decision, saying the
conference represents ``an extraordinary opportunity'' for dialogue
among public officials acutely affected by the drug problem.
   The decision to bar the mayor of Havana drew a sharp rebuke from
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who said that Cuban President Fidel
Castro has indicated strong interest in cooperating on drug-control
activities.
   Rangel, chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse
and Control, said in a telephone interview that the administration
decision shows that ``drugs are not on the administration's foreign
policy agenda'' despite strong public sentiment to the contrary.
   But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
administration questions the seriousness of the three goverments
``to undertake anti-narcotics cooperation with the U.S.
   ``In each of these cases, the mayors are in office with the
sanction of the highest authorities in his or her government,'' he
said.
   Redman noted that normal travel in the United States by officials
of the three countries has been suspended because of political
differences each has with the United States. This restriction must
be waived to allow visits by officials from any of the countries.
   Redman noted that there have been several allegations of
Nicaraguan government involving in drug smuggling.
   Last month, however, Nicaraguan officials offered to cooperate
with the United States in curtailing drug trafficking through that
country.
   Rangel's optimistic assessment of Cuba's attitude was based on a
December visit to Havana in which he and other committee members met
with Castro.
   At the time, Rangel said Castro told the delegation he wants very
much to cooperate with the United States and other Latin American
countries in interdicting shipments of drugs.
   ``If they offer to cooperate, we can't afford to say no,'' Rangel
said Wednesday.

   Britain announced Wednesday it is expelling about
30 Iranians on security grounds because of Iran's death threat
against novelist Salman Rushdie. The government also warned Britons
to get out of Lebanon.
   The Foreign Office said the 150 Britons in Lebanon are under
``increased threat'' from kidnappers following Iran's severing of
diplomatic relations Tuesday with Britain over Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Three Britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   An Iranian newspaper, Kayhan International, said the diplomatic
break ``will leave its negative impact on the fate of the British
hostages.''
   In Beirut, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds
two American hostages, said it has completed plans to kill Rushdie
but will first attack British police to get to him.
   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family, has
been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of
Iran sentenced him to death for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
Rushdie is believed to be under police guard in Britain.
   In Washington, an FBI official said ``zealous'' Iranian students
in the United States pose the greatest threat toward publishers and
others over the novel.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Britain is expelling the
Iranians because of Khomeini's refusal to revoke the death sentence.
   ``We have therefore decided on security grounds a number of
Iranians must be required to leave this country,'' Howe told the
House of Commons. ``We are keeping the activities of other Iranians
under very close review.''
   Howe also announced Britain ordered the closure of the Iranian
consulate in Hong Kong, a British colony. He said the staff had two
weeks to leave.
   Using his strongest language since the controversy began, Howe
called the Iranian government a ``deplorable regime'' and did not
rule out the possibility of ending all trade with Iran, saying, ``We
stand ready to take whatever action may be necessary in the light of
events.''
   A break in economic ties would prevent Britain from winning
lucrative contracts to help Iran's postwar reconstruction, estimated
to cost $500 billion. The move also comes at a time when Iran had
been seeking to expand its ties with the West.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up
to 30 Iranians ``who are held to be close to the regime'' will be
expelled soon. There are about 25,000 Iranians in Britain, including
2,400 students.
   Iran severed relations with a week after demanding Britain
denounce Rushdie and ban his novel, which Moslems say blasphemes
Islam.
   Kayhan International and another Tehran newspaper, Abrar, said
Iran may cut ties with nations that supported Britain and recalled
their envoys. These include Britain's 11 European Economic Community
partners as well as Canada, Sweden and Norway.
   Abrar also called for an end to economic ties with Britain.
   British officials said Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
government has no plans to stop trade with Iran. But one senior
official said, ``If the Iranians want to start a trade war, we
reckon they would lose.''
   In Beirut, Lebanon, the British Embassy advised Britons not to
travel to Lebanon ``as a result of the issue of author Salman
Rushdie.'' It urged those in the country to leave as soon as
possible.
   The warning was broadcast by the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon
radio.
   The British hostages _ Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite,
journalist John McCarthy, and teacher Brian Keenan _ all are
believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   The pro-Iranian Revolutionary Justice Organization, which holds
Americans Edward Austin Tracy and Joseph James Cicippio, said
Wednesday it has ``completed its preparations to execute the just
sentence issued'' by Khomeini.
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares that
before taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack
British police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order to
get to him,'' the statement added. It was accompanied by a
photograph of Tracy, but it did not threaten hostages.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain took the threat seriously.
   ``I don't think we can do more than remain in a state of
preparedness. Rushdie will continue to have the full protection of
the law,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   An FBI investigator, Oliver ``Buck'' Revell, told a Congressional
hearing thousands of ``zealous'' Iranians in the United States
illegally or on student visas could be a bigger threat than those
known to have links to terrorist networks.
   This is because they are not monitored and because the State
Department's standards for issuing visas are lax, he told the Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism.

   An Idaho businessman complained to Congress
Wednesday that staff members of the Consumer Product Safety
Commission had used heavy-handed tactics in trying to ban his only
product, a metal worm-harvesting probe that uses electric currents.
   Philip A. Dye of Caldwell, Idaho, told the consumer protection
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that agency
staff members also had acted in an underhanded fashion in their
investigation of his product and had refused to discuss possible
safety improvements.
   His problems, he said, showed that members of the commission
should be ``equipped with business knowledge and experience, and
most of all, what is lacking now, common sense.''
   A safety commission spokesman declined substantive comment, but a
commission member defended the agency's effort to get the product
off the market, suggesting the device ``probably is against every
known product standard in the civilized world.''
   Dye and his wife operate P &amp; M Enterprises, producing the ``Worm
Gett'r,'' a device to drive worms to the earth's surface.
   It is made up of two, six or 12 metal prongs inserted into the
ground and connected to a common two-wire, 120-volt AC household
circuit. The current flowing into the ground forces worms desired by
fishermen to rise to the surface.
   Dye says no one has been killed or injured from the 30,960 probes
he had sold at prices ranging up to $29.95 since starting the
business six years ago, and only one person had been known to
receive a shock.
   However, the commission staff, citing 20 deaths since 1980 from
other probes, often home-made, says the ``Worm Gett'r'' instructions
are inadequate and the device itself poses a good chance of a shock
strong enough to kill.
   The commission voted in 1987 to seek the recall of the Worm
Gett'r. But it failed to win a federal court order in Idaho last
year to remove the device from the market. An administratve law
judge is considering the commission staff's petition to declare the
probe a ``substantial product hazard'' that the commission could ban.
   ``Though a space of 50 years exists, the storm trooper tactics of
the SS and the safety Nazi tactics of the staff of the CPSC hold
many things in common,'' Dye said.
   ``Attempts were made to compromise with the CPSC. Shielding the
product's metal probe was suggested by us; instruction changes and
warnings were offered. None of these was acceptable,'' Dye said.
   He said commission investigators by subterfuge got access to his
customer lists from his shipping company, and visited customers
seeking information. This has caused some customers to cancel
orders, he said.
   His appearance was arranged by Republicans on the subcommittee.
Rep. Howard C. Nielson, R-Utah, said, ``This instance of what
appears to be an abuse of authority without a sufficient factual
basis is of interest because it was one of the prime reasons why the
commission was not re-authorized last year.''
   The commission and its staff were vigorously defended by R. David
Pittle, a former commission member who is now technical director of
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports.
   ``During the nine years I was a commissioner, at least five
manufacturers of worm probes ... voluntarily agreed to take the
remedial action the commission deemed appropriate,'' Pittle said.
   ``As an electrical engineer who has spent the last 20 years
designing, testing and evaluating consumer products, I continue to
believe that selling products that can predictably place live
electrodes in the bare hands of consumers is wholly unreasonable _
and probably is against every known product standard in the
civilized world.''
   ``In my view, the commission and its staff acted correctly in
trying to remove this hazard from the market,'' Pittle said.
   Commission spokesman Dave Shiflet said he could not comment in
substance because the case was still before an administrative law
judge, except to say, ``A settlement offer from Mr. Dye was never
sent to the administrative law judge as required by our procedures.''

possible construction of a canal across Nicaragua.
   The six-member private delegation met with a government committe,
headed by Finance Minister William Hupper, at the Foreign Ministry
on Wednesday morning. Reporters were not allowed access to the group.
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the leftist Sandinista
government party, said the Japanese group inclues specialists in
maritime law, ecology, engineering, architecture and lumber.
   It said the delegation arrived Tuesday night in Managua but did
not say how long it would remain in the Central American cuntry.
   The Japanese Embassy in Managua has said the Japanese government
is not involved in the delegation or the canal project.
   The idea of building a canal across Nicaragua to connect the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans has been around since the late 1800s,
but Panama was chosen instead for the construction of the canal.
   The Nicaraguan government, when it announced in early February
the formation of a committee to start feasibility studies, said it
welcomed private or public investment from other countries.

<HEAD>Bennett Not Upset about Taking On Gun-Control Duty</HEAD>

   As if planning the national battle against
illegal drugs wasn't enough work, President Bush saddled William J.
Bennett with another controversial job: figuring out what to do
about semiautomatic assault rifles.
   ``How does he feel about becoming gun czar?'' Bennett's
spokesman, Don Hamilton, said Wednesday. ``He's not too upset about
it.''
   In fact, Bennett met Wednesday with National Rifle Association
representatives, a meeting that had been scheduled before Bush
announced Tuesday that he had asked his designated drug policy
director to find a solution to the weapons problem, Hamilton said.
   It's not clear whether Bennett will incorporate his
recommendations into the national drug control strategy due 180 days
after he is confirmed as director of national drug control policy or
if he will issue a separate recommendation, Hamilton said.
   Asked Wednesday what Bennett and the NRA representatives were
discussing, Hamilton said, ``I think he's seeking input and advice.
I'm rather confident he has not made up his mind.
   ``He's interested in seeing that firepower out of the wrong
hands,'' Hamilton said. ``He's concerned with the problem and he'd
like to seek a solution that's consonant with the Constitution and
individuals' rights concerning firearms. But he doesn't want to see
that firepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys.''
   The Senate Judiciary Committee, which held two days of hearings
on Bennett's nomination last week, is scheduled to vote on it
Thursday. There was little opposition raised during the hearings and
he was expected to be approved by the committee, then approved by
the full Senate, possibly as soon as Friday.
   The weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of AK-47s
and Uzis. The tightly regulated military versions can switch back
and forth from semiautomatic to automatic.
   A host of drug-related shootings and the killing of five
California schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on the
weapons with high-capacity ammunition clips. Bush, a member of the
NRA, has said he opposes such regulation, while first lady Barbara
Bush supports a ban.

<HEAD>Americans See U.S. Second to Japan in Economic Power, Poll Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans by a two-to-one margin believe that
Japan, not the United States, is now the leading economic power in
the world, according to a public opinion poll released Wednesday.
   The poll, conducted by The Gallup Organization for the Times
Mirror Co., indicated that 59 percent of Americans now rank Japan
first with only 29 percent choosing their own country.
   ``Our survey finds, beneath the surface of general economic
contentment, much unease about the loss of U.S. economic power to
foreign competition,'' said Gallup president Andrew Kohut. ``People
see our ability to compete as declining in the Reagan years.''
   On the other hand, the survey found that 72 percent of policy
makers, executives and other opinion leaders still believe America
is the No. 1 economic power, a sharp difference with the general
public.
   There was just as big a disagreement over the question of foreign
investment in the United States. An overwhelming majority of the
public, 70 percent, saw foreign investment in very negative terms,
with many fearing that foreigners are ``buying'' America and
threatening national security.
   But opinion leaders saw foreign investment as a vital source of
capital for economic expansion.
   The survey, one of a series the Los Angeles-based news company
has commissioned on American attitudes, was conducted between Jan.
27 and Feb. 5. It included one-hour face-to-face interviews with
2,048 members of the general public and had a potential sampling
margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points.
   A separate survey sampled the opinion of 250 government policy
makers, corporate executives, Wall Street financiers and foreign
investors in the U.S. economy.
   The survey of the general public, described as the most extensive
ever on economic attitudes, indicated that 54 percent of Americans
expect things will be better for them financially next year and an
additional 28 percent expected no change in their economic outlook.
But they were much less optimistic about the nation's overall
economic prospects.
   By sizable margins, the general public said it expected inflation
to worsen and interest rates to be rise. Fully 76 percent said they
expected taxes to be increased in 1989, despite President Bush's
``no-new-taxes'' campaign pledge.
   The survey indicated that Americans strongly oppose increasing
general income taxes although large majorities were willing to see
higher taxes on tobacco, alcohol and on people with incomes over
$80,000 a year.
   The poll indicated 85 percent of Americans favored raising taxes
on alcoholic beverages to reduce the federal budget deficit, 75
percent favored boosting taxes on tobacco products and 64 percent
were in favor of a national lottery to bring in revenues.
   Four out of five Americans, 82 percent, favored increasing the
income taxes of people with incomes above $80,000. A smaller
majority, 59 percent, endorsed a proposal to create a new 33 percent
tax bracket for all income over $150,000.
   While calling the budget deficit a major problem, only 18 percent
of Americans could come within $50 billion of guessing its size.
Last year's deficit totaled $155.1 billion, but 28 percent guessed
it was over $300 billion.
   Fears of war and international tension were as low as they have
been in 40 years, the survey said. For example, 79 percent of the
public feels that tensions with the Soviets have been reduced.
   As a reflection of the eased world tensions, the survey found
strong sentiment for cutting the military budget. Asked how to
reduce the federal budget by 5 percent, the public opted to take
nearly half of the revenues from the defense budget.
   The public strongly opposed cuts in Social Security or Medicare
to balance the budget.

<HEAD>Hall: Japan Should Help With Collider</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Department negotiators should pressure
the Japanese into sharing the $4.6 billion cost of the super
collider as a way for Japan to pare its trade imbalance with the
United States, the chairman of a House subcommittee considering the
project said Wednesday.
   ``Japan is the No. 1 (cost-sharing) suspect for us because of the
bad balance of trade and (we should) approach them on that level,''
Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Texas, told DOE officials during a hearing on
foreign participation in the proposed giant atom smasher.
   Hall said later that the trade imbalance with Japan would be a
good lever in cost-sharing negotiations between officials of both
countries.
   ``It gives us a special incentive to dealing with Japan,'' said
Hall, the chairman of the Science, Space and Technology Committee's
subcommittee on international scientific cooperation.
   The United States ran a trade deficit with Japan of $55.4 billion
in 1988, 40 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit of $137 billion.
   James F. Decker, deputy director of DOE's energy research office,
told Hall that U.S. officials are in Japan holding ``unofficial, but
very significant, discussions with Japan's high-energy physics
community on possible ways of collaboration.''
   Decker said it is essential to ``encourage the enthusiastic
support of the Japanese scientists because strong endorsement at
this level is almost certainly a prerequisite for Japanese
participation.''
   But the involvement of President Bush and Energy Secretary James
D. Watkins may be ultimately be needed to convince the Japanese to
invest in the project, Decker said.
   Only India has committed to helping build the super collider,
agreeing to put $50 million into the project, a proposed 53-mile
underground tunnel south of Dallas in which beams of protons would
smash into each other with 20 times the energy of today's most
powerful accelerators.
   But neither foreign countries nor Texas will be willing to
bankroll the project unless Congress commits to its construction,
the panel was told by Decker and Thomas W. Luce III, chairman of the
Texas National Research Laboratory Commission, the state agency
handling Texas' role in the project.
   If Congress goes along with the president and agrees to spend
$250 million on the project in the fiscal 1990 budget, including
$160 million for construction, Texas and foreign countries would
read that as adequate commitment to the project, the officials said.
   The Energy Department is proposing $1.8 billion of the total cost
come from non-federal sources, including $1 billion that Texas has
promised to spend.

<HEAD>Iran Said To Be Building Missile Factory With Help from China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China is helping Iran build a factory to
make surface-to-surface missiles with a range exceeding 500 miles,
Western diplomatic sources said Wednesday.
   They said construction has gone ahead since a U.N.-mediated
cease-fire halted the eight-year Iran-Iraq war on Aug. 20 and that
Iran also is continuing to develop its chemical warfare capability.
   The sources, speaking on the condition of not being identified,
said the missile factory is in northeastern Iran, but they could
give no details.
   One source remarked: ``It's a missile plant and the Chinese are
lending support to build it. That much is known.''
   Tehran television, monitored in Cyprus, said China's deputy prime
minister, Tian Jiyun, ended a five-day trip to Iran on Tuesday. It
made no mention of weapons, saying only that the visit concentrated
on trade and industrial ties.
   China and Iran both deny any arms deals, but U.S. and other
Western officials say China has been a main supplier of weapons for
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime. They estimated such sales at
more than $1 billion.
   Among the arms supplied were two types of jet aircraft and the
HY-2 Silkworm and C-801 anti-ship missiles, which have a range of
less than 100 miles.
   The Tehran government said a year ago it was building its own
version of a ``foreign missile'' _ not further identified _ for use
against Iraq.
   According to the authoritative reference, Jane's Weapons Systems,
China's arsenal does not include a surface-to-surface missile with a
500- to 600-mile range, but Western experts said then it would be
relatively simple for Iran to have copied Soviet-designed Scud-B
rockets acquired from Syria or Libya.
   The war between Iran and Iraq, its Persian Gulf neighbor, began
in September 1980 and was marked by periodic missile bombardments of
each other's population centers in what became known as the ``war of
the cities.''
   Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, lies only 60 miles from the border,
and so the initial advantage went to Iran. Last spring, however,
Iraq began using long-range missiles to hit Tehran and other areas
of Iran previously beyond range.
   Some analysts have said Iraq's use of Scud-Bs with boosters to
increase their 160-mile range was a major factor in forcing Iran to
agree to a truce.

   The strike against Eastern Airlines threatens to
spread to several railroads if a federal judge's restraining order
expires or is overturned.
   In that case, rail employees could observe Eastern employees'
picket lines. Here are answers to some questions raised by the case:
   Q. Why could rail passengers be affected by an airline strike?
   A. Because Eastern's unions hope to bring pressure to bear on the
airline and the government by extending the strike to other forms of
transportation.
   Q. But isn't such a tactic _ a secondary boycott _ illegal under
the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947?
   A. Yes, but the railroad and airline unions are covered by the
Railway Labor Act of 1926, not Taft-Hartley.
   Q. Why are those unions outside the main body of labor
legislation?
   A. Because in the 1920s the railroads had unparalleled power,
wealth and political influence, and because their pay and mediation
practices were different from everyone else's.
   Q. But why are airlines covered by the Railway Act?
   A. When Congress amended the Railway Act in 1934, the unions of
the fledgling airline industry lobbied to be included. Congress went
along, although it may not have realized at the time how soon
airlines would dwarf railroads in importance. Transportation unions
in other industries, such as trucks and buses, are covered by the
Wagner Act of 1935, which Taft-Hartley amended.
   Q. Why wouldn't Congress extend its policy against secondary
boycotts to the Railway Act?
   A. The railway unions had much more political power immediately
after World War II than they do today, so amending the act would
have been problematic. The Railway Act, moreover, represented a
compromise worked out by management and labor specifically for their
industry; Congress was reluctant to tamper with it.
   Q. How have other secondary boycotts turned out?
   A. Until 1947 they were one of organized labor's most potent
weapons. The few secondary boycotts that have occurred since have
been brief; either the president stepped in and imposed a
cooling-off period, or judges stopped them, citing the public
welfare.
   Q. What commuter rail lines might be struck if the judge does not
bar a sympathy strike?
   A. Twelve commuter lines, in addition to Amtrak, could be shut
down. They are the Long Island Rail Road; the Metro-North Commuter
Railroad; New Jersey Transit; Port Authority Trans-Hudson, or PATH;
the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority; the Northern Indiana
Commuter Transportation District; the Maryland Transportation
Authority of Baltimore and suburban Washington; the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority; the Rapid Transit Authority
in Chicago; CalTrans, which operates between San Francisco and San
Jose; the Port Authority of Allegheny County in Pittsburgh; and
Tri-Rail, southern Florida's new 67-mile rail system.
   Q. Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road are owned by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a creature of the state of
New York. So why aren't the railroad employees governed by the
state's Taylor Law, which prohibits strikes by public employees?
   A. The Supreme Court has ruled that those workers are covered by
the Railway Act, which preceded the Taylor Law.
   Q. Why has U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued an
injuncton against the secondary boycott? Doesn't the Norris-La
Guardia Act bar such action by the federal judiciary in labor
disputes?
   A. There is an exception for cross-industry secondary boycotts
and strikes, reflecting Congress's conviction that labor battles,
including strikes, should be restricted to unions and companies in
the same industry.
   Q. But since Eastern and the railroads are all covered by the
same labor legislation, aren't they in the same industry?
   A. That's for the courts to say.

<HEAD>Developer of Vaccine for Monkeys Skeptical about Use for AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALE LEACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist who developed a vaccine to
protect monkeys against a virus distantly related to the one that
causes AIDS cautioned Wednesday the work probably won't lead to an
AIDS vaccine anytime soon.
   ``It would be foolish on my part to say, yeah, this opens up the
way for a vaccine for AIDS,'' said Dr. Richard G. Olsen, a professor
emeritus of veterinary pathobiology at Ohio State University.
``Whether it would work for AIDS, I'd be very skeptical.''
   However, one well-known AIDS researcher said he thought the
monkey vaccine could be quite valuable in developing an AIDS vaccine.
   Olsen and Ohio State graduate students last week announced
preliminary success with a vaccine to immunize monkeys against the
HTLV-1 virus. The vaccine uses an approach similar to that of a
vaccine Olsen developed several years ago, which veterinarians now
use to protect millions of house cats from a deadly disease.
   That illness, called feline leukemia; the HTLV-1 virus, which
causes adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma; and the virus that causes
AIDS all belong to the retrovirus family. Unlike other viruses,
retroviruses become part of a chromosome, which carries genetic
information.
   The AIDS virus has other characteristics in common with HTLV-1.
Both can be transmitted through blood, sexual intercourse and
contaminated needles, and HTLV-1 causes AIDS-like symptoms in
monkeys.
   Some of the eight or so macaque monkeys vaccinated by Olsen's
group and then exposed to HTLV-1 have gone as long as two years
without their blood cells showing any signs of infection, Olsen said.
   All five or six monkeys in a control group that were exposed to
the virus without being vaccinated eventually developed the illness,
he said.
   Olsen said his research during the next two years will attempt to
prove the vaccine can prevent the virus from getting into a
chromosome and lying dormant.
   ``You're in essence dealing with an agent that's adding new
genetic material to the host chromosome,'' Olsen said.
   The vaccine does not contain the virus, just ``pieces and parts''
of proteins that make up the virus, Olsen said.
   Dr. Danny Bolognesi, a virologist and professor of experimental
surgery at Duke University, said he was not familiar with Olsen's
work but that a vaccine against HTLV-1 virus would be significant in
terms of AIDS research.
   ``Any vaccine against any member of the retrovirus family is of
enormous value,'' Bolognesi said.
   Asked about the adaptability of a vaccine from monkeys to humans,
Bolognesi said, ``That's pretty close. It's a good model. I would
say the transition to man ... would not be too difficult.''
   Olsen said Ohio State researchers are in their fourth year of
research on the HTLV-1 vaccine. Ohio State plans to open a Center
for Retrovirus Research next month, using university money and
royalties from the cat vaccine, but Olsen said his group would not
try to work with the more volatile AIDS virus for at least a couple
of years.
   ``We're going to finish what we've got, do well with what we've
got, before jumping into other things,'' he said.
   ``The AIDS virus changes very rapidly,'' he said. ``The HTLV-1
virus is far more stable genetically.''
   He explained that drawing blood from 10 people and growing the
HTLV-1 virus in tissue cultures would result in little or no
difference in the virus from person to person. Doing the same thing
with the AIDS virus would produce different results from person to
person, Olsen said.
   ``That's what's going to make the (AIDS) vaccine thing very
difficult,'' he said.

   Mourners wore blue ribbons Wednesday to
symbolize commitment to battered women as they laid to rest a woman
who police say was bludgeoned to death by her former husband while
he was on a prison furlough.
   ``In a world filled with people who care only for themselves, she
was a person who cared deeply for others,'' the Rev. Barry England
said of Lisa M. Bianco during funeral services at St. Anthony
Catholic Church.
   Ms. Bianco, 29, a battered wife before divorcing in 1985, last
year became a counselor to battered women at an Elkhart County
shelter. She rose to program director.
   ``Lisa listened to people who cried out,'' England said. ``She
healed their wounds. Having experienced pain and hurt herself, she
continued to love.''
   Nearly 200 mourners, including Ms. Bianco's two daughters, ages 6
and 10, attended the services and burial at Chapel Hill Memorial
Gardens in Osceola.
   St. Joseph County Prosecutor Michael Barnes said a decision
whether to seek the death penalty against Ms. Bianco's former
husband, Alan L. Matheney, 38, would be made next week. Matheney is
being held without bail on murder charges.
   Matheney, who was serving an eight-year prison term for beating
Ms. Bianco and criminally confining their children in 1987, was
released Saturday from the Correctional Industrial Complex in
Pendleton on an eight-hour pass.
   Ms. Bianco was beaten to death with the butt of a shotgun
Saturday outside her Mishawaka home, police said. The force of at
least 20 blows to her head shattered the weapon's wooden stock.
Matheney was arrested later that day.
   Ms. Bianco had asked Department of Correction officials to notify
her if Matheney was released, friends and family members say. Two
prison officers have been suspended without pay for approving the
furlough and failing to notify her.
   Gov. Evan Bayh immediately suspended the furlough program pending
a review.
   The shelter's Wednesday evening counseling session, which Ms.
Bianco was to have attended, was to be held in her honor, said
shelter director Michalyn Chilcote.
   Ms. Bianco had recently joined the Mishawaka Commission on the
Status of Women, which will lobby the Legislature to improve laws to
protect victims of domestic violence, said its president, Bonnie
Bailey.
   Ms. Bianco's brother, Mark, of Mishawaka, urged people to wear
blue ribbons to symbolize their commitment, as well as his sister's,
to helping battered women. Blue was her favorite color, he said.
   ``Let the people who make the laws know we need changes,'' he
said. ``We need more help for battered women's shelters.''
   A memorial fund was set up in her name by the women's shelter.
   In an interview videotaped by prosecutors two years ago, a badly
bruised Ms. Bianco said Matheney had threatened to beat her and take
the couple's two children.
   He said ``he would make my life so miserable that I would wish
daily that I was dead,'' she said.
   ``I bartered for my life yesterday and told him that I would not
prosecute,'' she continued. ``I'm afraid if he does get a hold of me
again that I'm not going to be able to talk about it.''

   Maurice Turner Jr., the District of Columbia's
police chief, said Wednesday that medical researchers should find a
way to immunize youngsters so they won't get high on drugs and thus
would avoid becoming involved in the narcotics trade that has
contributed to a crime wave here.
   ``I believe the greatest contribution the medical community of
this great nation could ever conceive for our children would be the
development of an inoculation or vaccine that would block the
euphoria or high our youth receive from smoking, ingesting or
injecting PCP, crack cocaine, cocaine or heroin into their bodies,''
Turner told reporters.
   However, Dr. Marvin Snyder, director of preclinical research at
the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said the idea of inoculation
was ``theoretically possible'' but not practical.
   Snyder said the prospect of inoculation brings up various ethical
questions, such as whether ``anyone has the right to put someone on
a drug or chemical or immunization that would prevent them from
engaging in an activity.''
   Washington's record homicide rate has followed the trend in other
major American and Canadian cities when the crack cocaine appeared
on the drug-abuse scene, Turner said, and killings probably won't
stop until drug dealers settle turf battles.
   ``This city is one of the last cities where crack became the drug
of choice,'' Turner said.
   The city had a record 372 homicides in 1988, and police said
about 70 percent were related to drugs. By Wednesday, 100 people had
been slain in the city, compared with 55 at this time last year.

   Protesting Howard University students Wednesday
escalated their demonstration, disrupting classes and blocking the
entrance of a site they thought was being used for temporary
administrative offices.
   After learning they had succeeded in driving Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater from the school's board of trustees, the
students focused their attention on other demands.
   ``At the top of the list is assurances that there will be no
repercussions,'' said student leader William Simms. ``We also want
to see Atwater's resignation accepted in writing, and assurances of
financial aid and better housing.''
   Improved security and a graduate African studies program are also
on the list of demands at the predominantly black campus.
   Students took over the administration building Monday to protest
Atwater's appointment to the board of trustees.
   Howard President James Cheek has said the students' occupation of
the administration building could stop faculty members from
receiving their payroll checks, due Thursday. When the students
learned the school planned to set up a temporary administrative
office in the school's liberal arts building, they staged a sit-in
just inside the entrance.
   However, after Simms met with Liberal Arts Dean Wendy Winters, he
directed the students to leave the site.
   The group of 50 or so students then went on a nearby building and
interrupted classes, chanting and yelling, before regrouping and
returning to the administrative building.
   ``We're trying to rally more support,'' Simms said. ``And we will
continue to disrupt classes and this university until we can open
some lines of communication.''
   Earlier Wednesday, District of Columbia delegate Walter Fauntroy
met with the students in the administration building.
   ``I came for two reasons,'' Fauntroy said. ``To get the details
on the students' demands and to find out what they want met before
leaving the building.''

   Fire swept through an old five-story
apartment building in this eastern town early Wednesday, killing 14
people and injuring 10, fire officials said.
   Four people were killed when they jumped from windows after being
awakened by the predawn blaze, fire officials said. The 10 others
died from burns or asphyxiation by the black smoke that engulfed the
corridors.
   Firefighters, whose ranks swelled to 120, took more than two
hours to put out the blaze near the train station in the center of
the town 25 miles southwest of Mulhouse, near the Swiss border.
   The building, an old hotel transformed in 1982 into furnished
studios, housed students at the Technological University of Sevenans
as well as some workers and elderly.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known. It was thought
to have started in a third-floor stairwell.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, mayor of the town of
51,000, visited the scene Wednesday afternoon, listening to
survivors who told him of the ``disastrous'' state of electrical
wiring in the building.
   Four bodies were found in the ravaged building soon after the
fire was extinguished, and the daylong search through the debris
turned up six more bodies, according to rescue officials.
   Ten people were injured, four of them hospitalized, with one
person in serious condition, according to the officials.
   A temporary morgue and medical station were set up in the nearby
train station.
   It was not known how many of the building residents were present
at the time of the fire, which fire officials said was Belfort's
worst since 1940.

<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, in his first tough
call since running for vice president last year, parted company with
virtually all of his fellow Senate Democrats Wednesday in declaring
he'll vote for fellow Texan John Tower as defense secretary.
   But his endorsement seemed to avoid putting personal prestige on
the line for his former Senate colleague or another Texas friend,
George Bush.
   ``I hope that when I get the next chance to talk with John Tower
about tough job of keeping this country strong, it will be while
he's in his new office,'' Bentsen said in a speech to the Senate.
   His announcement ended weeks of silence on his part and
speculation by others on whether Bentsen would side with Bush or
with his Democratic colleagues.
   It came only after Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
predicted the votes were in place to defeat the nomination whatever
Bentsen's decision.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the Armed Services Committee chairman and
the man leading the opposition to Tower, walked over to Bentsen,
touched his shoulder and shook his hand.
   Bentsen's decision was closely watched both because of his Texas
ties and because of the visibility he has held since he had the No.
2 spot on the Democratic ticket last fall.
   Bentsen has assumed the role of party heavyweight, delivering the
Senate Democratic response to Bush's first speech to Congress and
declaring his opposition to some of the administration's spending
cuts and tax proposals.
   When Tower was nominated in January, Bentsen's vote for him
seemed a sure thing. Bentsen spoke warmly about his long-time
colleague when he first presented Tower to the Senate Armed Service
Committee as Bush's choice for secretary of defense.
   He brushed aside as ``just politics'' the brutal attacks against
Democrats by Tower during last fall's campaign. Bentsen sought to
reassure more liberal senators that the hawkish Tower was a good
choice to hold down spending.
   ``John Tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank check
from the U.S. Treasury to the Pentagon,'' Bentsen said.
   But as the showdown over the nomination grew in intensity,
Bentsen avoided the Senate debate _ until Wednesday _ and kept quiet
on how his vote would be cast.
   Republicans in Texas became impatient, as did Bush, whose calls
included one during his Far East trip. Bentsen spoke to the
president ``on three or four occasions,'' said Jack DeVore,
Bentsen's spokesman.
   Tower supporters from Texas pressured Bentsen with telephone
banks and newspaper ads.
   One of the Texas ads referred to him as ``L. Millard Bentsen'' _
a swipe at alleged snootiness derived from last year's campaign,
when Bentsen and Michael Dukakis referred to now-Vice President Dan
Quayle as ``J. Danforth Quayle.''
   But friends and allies said Bentsen, re-elected to a six-year
Senate at the same time he lost his vice presidential bid, felt
little direct political pressure.
   Bentsen reached his decision over the weekend, DeVore said.
   Fellow Democrats would understand Bentsen siding with Tower
because Texans have ``a long tradition of closing ranks,'' said
Joseph O'Neill, a Washington lobbyist who has been Bentsen's top
Senate aide and was chief of staff for his vice presidential
campaign.
   He also would have been safe politically if he had gone against
Tower, said George Christian, a Texas friend and consultant who
served as press secretary to President Lyndon Johnson.
   ``There is not a high degree of passion on either side in Texas.
It's almost titillation rather than any comsuming passion in it,''
he said. The campaigns to influence Bentsen were ``wasting their
money,'' he said.
   Tower supporters expressed relief at Bentsen's announcement.
   ``I think that the timing would have been better if it came
earlier in the debate. But at this stage, I'll take him any time I
can get him,'' said Tower friend Paul Eggers.
   Brad O'Leary, a Washington consultant who raised money for
Tower's Senate campaigns, said Bentsen's timing was ``on target''
for boosting the nomination.
   ``Waiting for one or two other people to do it and and then
standing up and doing it helps build a little psychological
momentum,'' he said.

   The John Birch Society is pulling up roots and
moving out of the liberal stronghold of Massachusetts, but a
spokesman said Wednesday the arch-conservatives were driven away by
prices, not politics.
   ``The aspects of Massachusetts that we couldn't take was the
expense to live here,'' said John McManus at the group's
headquarters in Belmont, a Boston suburb.
   The group plans to close its Belmont and San Marino, Calif.,
offices and consolidate operations in Appleton, Wis., by the fall.
   Reasons for the move include lower overhead and the fact that the
new chief executive officer, G. Allen Bubolz, lives in Appleton,
McManus said.
   Appleton also is near Grand Chute, hometown of Republican Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, which McManus termed ``a delightful piece of
irony.'' McCarthy led investigations into alleged communist
influence in the 1950s.
   The 31-year-old society, which once labeled President Eisenhower
a ``dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy,'' has
struggled financially for years, making a appeal for funds after
founder Robert H.W. Welch Jr. died in 1985.
   ``If anybody in the Midwest wants to say thank you to anybody for
the John Birch Society moving in that area they can thank (Gov.)
Michael Dukakis, they can thank Sen. Ted Kennedy and the
Massachusetts congressional delegation,'' said McManus, blaming the
Democratic politicians for the high cost of living in the area.
   The society listed 1987 liabilities of $8.5 million in its latest
filing with the state. The fund balance showed a loss of $7.8
million, compared with a starting deficit of $7.7 million.
   ``We have always been in debt. We always spent more money than we
took in and we always had to go in and scramble,'' McManus said.
   Belmont town officials didn't return telephone calls Wednesday.
   News of the move prompted mixed reaction in Appleton. Mayor
Dorothy Johnson said the town was open to people of all views, but
City Attorney Greg Carmen said he was worried that Appleton's image
would be hurt.
   ``We don't expect everyone to welcome us with open arms,''
McManus said. ``But we mean him no harm nor do we mean harm to any
American.''
   Welch, a candy maker, was one of 12 men who founded the society
in 1958, convinced that leaders around the globe were secretly
planning a world government.
   The society was named after an American intelligence officer who
was killed by Chinese communists in 1945; Birchers consider him the
first casualty of the Cold War. McManus said the socity has several
tens of thousands of members.

   Former astronaut Sally K. Ride told a Senate
committee Wednesday the United States and other nations in the world
need to undertake a comprehensive study of the Earth in learn how to
protect the planet from the destructive influences of humanity.
   Ride, the first American woman in space, said science now
recognizes that activities of civilization ``have begun to affect
the conditions of the planet'', but there is little fundamental
understanding of how the Earth's weather, geology, oceans and ice
react together to influence the environment.
   ``We do not yet understand how our planet works,'' she said.
``The Earth is a very complicated place. It has to be studied as a
system.''
   Ride said a project called Mission to Planet Earth would, for the
first time, study the Earth in a way that would relate to each other
all of the natural and human forces that influence the planet.
   She was one of three witness testifying in support of the project
before the Senate committee on commerce, science and transportation.
   Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., a member of the committee, said there is a
need for the mission because humans are beginning to realize that
industrial chemicals and gases released into the atmosphere have the
potential of affecting life on the planet by changing the weather
and climate.
   He said most nations already recognize the need to halt release
of chemicals that erode the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere, and
that carbon dioxide and other gases from industry may be affecting
the Earth's climate through the so-called ``greenhouse effect.''
   The greenhouse effect is a planetary warming caused by certain
gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from the sun. Most of these
gases, such as carbon dioxide, are produced mainly by the burning of
fossil fuels.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, chairman of the committee, said that the
costs for the mission have been estimated at $20 to $30 billion out
to the year 2010. Ride said the cost would be about a billion
dollars a year, and that foreign nations could pay a share.
   The former astronaut, who joined the faculty at Stanford
University after leaving NASA, said Mission to Planet Earth would
involve nine instrumented satellites, experiments aboard the
proposed space station, science stations on Earth, and a data
handling system that would analyze all of the collected information.
   Ride said that the project would require the cooperation and
participation of all the Earth's nations. Some nations, she said,
could provide at least two of the satellites and most countries
could establish and operate ground monitoring stations to gather
measurements from all over the globe.
   Another witness, Don L. Anderson of the California Institute of
Technology, said a coordinated effort between earth, space, ocean
and atmospheric studies would be needed to understand how each
element affects the weather, climate and rainfall on the planet.
   He said with a thorough study of Earth from a variety of
perspectives would enable scientists within 20 years to make
accurate predictions about weather, the changes in geology and
climate, and how human actions affect the planet.
   Lennard A. Fisk, chief of space sciences at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said the agency already has
made organizational steps toward starting a major effort to study
Earth. He said specific plans will be presented to congress in June,
including plans for satellites.

<HEAD>Draft Report Overstated Dangers of Drilling: Murkowski</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dangers described in an Environmental
Protection Agency draft report on the effects of oil drilling on
Alaska's North Slope are misleading and no reason to delay oil
exploration in more arctic areas, a Senate committee was told
Wednesday.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the draft report, first
described in a story in Sunday's New York Times, ``needs substantial
work before its finished.''
   ``It's not an objective portrayal,'' he said.
   Tom Williams, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee staff, said the draft was a summary of a ``trip report''
after a visit to the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge (ANWR), where oil exploration has been proposed.
   ``The problems which are documented in the report are activities
which have been raised for not opening ANWR from the beginning,''
said Williams.
   The draft EPA report said improper and careless management of
chemical oil wastes on Alaska's North Slope is seriously damaging
the delicate tundra, the Times reported.
   The report said acres of tundra have been damaged by chemical
spills, oil wastes seeping from drilling pads, stacks of leaking
chemical drums, a mine flooded by a diverted river, overflowing
waste disposal pits and failure to comply with federal regulations
governing the handling of hazardous materials by oil companies in
the Prudhoe Bay oilfields.
   ANWR, just east of the Prudhoe Bay fields, is considered a
promising area for a strike that could produce up to 3.2 billion
barrels of oil, but it also is the breeding ground for North
America's largest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the
habitat for polar bears, musk oxen, wolves, arctic foxes, waterfowl
and fish.
   Legislation that would allow exploratory drilling to begin is
being debated by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
but no action has been taken.
   Murkowski, in promoting the bill, said that since the drilling in
Prudhoe Bay began, there have been advancements in technology that
minimize damage to the environment.
   Furthermore, he said, if no oil is found, the area will revert
completely to its natural state.

   Oliver North once shrugged off the idea that
his work on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras might get him in
trouble, saying ``I don't care if I have to go to jail for this, I
don't care if I have to lie to Congress,'' a witness testified at
his trial Wednesday.
   Charges against North include lying to Congress about his
involvement in aid to the Contras at a time when U.S. military help
was banned.
   Conservative fund-raiser Carl R. Channel said North made the
statement in a conversation with Nelson Bunker Hunt, after flying to
Dallas to brief the wealthy Texan on the situation in Nicaragua.
   ``The only thing that sticks in my mind is that Bunker said what
are you going to do? Do you mind getting into trouble?'' Channell
testified. After North gave his answer, Channell said, Hunt
``chortled.''
   Meanwhile, in a related Iran-Contra case, the trial of retired
Vice Adm. John Poindexter, formerly a national security adviser and
North's boss, was shifted from the court of U.S. District Judge
Gerhard Gesell to that of Judge Aubrey Robinson. Gesell is presiding
over the North trial, now in its fifth week.
   The testimony about Hunt was part of a day-long recitation by
Channell about putting North, then a National Security Council aide,
together with wealthy people for briefings about fighting in
Nicaragua.
   Channell said North never personally solicited contributions. The
former Marine lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring to
defraud the U.S. Treasury as part of the money-raising efforts.
   ``He'd say if people wanted to give after he gave the briefing,
they should give to someone else,'' said Channell under
cross-examination by North lawyer Brendan Sullivan. ``If someone
said `who do I make the check out to,' he said ``you make out the
check to Spitz's organization.''
   ``Spitz'' is Channell's nickname. His organization was called the
National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty.
   The organization was recognized by the Internal Revenue Service
as a tax-exempt foundation, meaning contributions were
tax-deductible. One of the 12 charges on which North is being tried
says that instead of the money going for charitable works it went
for Contra arms instead.
   ``I was aware we had varied from our mandate, but felt that could
be resolved,'' said Channell, who said he'd assumed since they had
been working with the White House, the legal consel there would find
a way to justify where the money had gone.
   Channell pleaded guilty on April 29, 1987, to depriving the
government of tax revenue by using the foundation to solicit
contributions for military equipment for the Contras. He has not
been sentenced. He pledged under a plea-bargaining agreement to
testify for the government whenever he was called on.
   Under questioning by North's attorney, he said he was proud of
his work for the Contras.
   He testified he received a letter from then-President Reagan
commending his efforts, and then a telephone call. The president
mentioned that he did not understand the opposition of then-House
Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. to Contra aid.
   Channell said he told Reagan that O'Neill ``prays every day to
defeat everything you believe in and you must fight him as an enemy
and defeat him.''
   He said that the North-Hunt meeting was in Dallas' Petroleum Club
on Sept. 11, 1985 and that North flew there from Washington in a
Channell-arranged airplane. At the end of the meeting North left,
saying ``something like `you all are going to talk about money and I
can't take any money.''
   During the congressional Iran-Contra hearings two years ago,
North testified, ``I do not recall ever asking a single, solitary
American citizen for money'' although ``I showed a lot of munitions
lists.''
   Hunt contributed $237,500 to the foundation and also made a
$237,500 loan to it.
   In addition, Channell testified that North told a Connecticut
woman, Ellen Garwood, about a need for small airplanes for the
rebels. Later that day, she wrote out a check for $75,000 and wrote
across the top that it was tax deductible, he said.
   Mrs. Garwood was at the airport after the North-Hunt meeting, he
said. ``Ollie talked about the need for more planes and she gave
NEPL a check for $32,000 to buy a small plane.''
   When Hunt's checks arrived, Channell said, he asked North to
telephone his thanks. North called Hunt at his home and it happened
that the late CIA director, William Casey, was a dinner guest.
Channell said North commented that the director ``would now know
what was going on.''
   He also testified he arranged for a 10-15 minute meeting between
a wealthy woman, Barbara Newington, and Reagan. Later that day, he
said, North talked with her, and Channell told North he was going to
ask her for a large grant.
   ``Grant?'' asked Gesell. ``You asked her for money!''
   ``I told Colonel North I would try to ask her for over a million
dollars,'' Channel replied.
   The woman made her contribution later, more than $1 million in
stocks, Channell said.

<HEAD>U.S. Holds Up Aid Pending Egyptian Economic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is holding up $230 million in
aid for Egypt because President Hosni Mubarak's government has
failed to adopt acceptable economic reforms, State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said Wednesday.
   Redman denied that the aid was contingent on Egypt's agreeing
with the International Monetary Fund on an economic austerity
package, but said it was important that the reforms adopted command
broad international support, including that of the IMF and World
Bank.
   Redman denied a report in the Washington Post that quoted an
unidentified U.S. official as saying, ``We're holding out at this
point for an agreement with the IMF.''
   ``It's not because of the IMF agreement,'' said Redman.
   Egyptian sources said, however, that the United States was tying
its decision to IMF conditions, which they said may be applicable in
general but would be very difficult to implement in Egypt because of
the low incomes of many.
   The sources, who spoke to a reporter on condition they not be
identified, noted recent rioting over IMF reforms in Venezuela,
Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco and recalled that Egypt had food-price
riots 12 years ago that forced President Anwar Sadat to roll back
increases.
   At least 79 people were killed in the 1977 riots, with some
estimates of the casualties going to 800 killed and injured.
   ``We agree with the IMF on the diagnosis and the prescription,
but we differ on the amount of time to implement it,'' said one
source. Egypt, which already has increased prices on bread and other
basic commodities five to ten times in recent years, would like to
phase in the reforms over a few years, he said.
   ``Ideally we would like very much to implement the reforms at the
same pace recommended by the IMF, but it's a question of
practicality,'' he said, adding that the Egyptian government hoped
``Washington, as an ally and friend, would be more sensitive to our
political and social circumstances than a bank.''
   ``We regard the relationship with Egypt as extremely important,
both to us as well as to the interest of broader stability in the
region,'' Redman said.
   He said the aid, a portion of about $4.5 billion in economic and
military assistance approved for the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years, was
being held up because the legislation approved by Congress made it
contingent on ``the understanding that Egypt will undertake
significant economic reforms which are additional to those which
were undertaken in previous fiscal years.''

   The state Commerce Department estimated Wednesday
that $8 million in tourist dollars would be lost this week in
Florida because of the strike against Eastern Airlines.
   The state said it based its figures on an estimate that 10
percent of air tourists who had planned to visit Florida could not
get there.
   Meanwhile, competing airlines increased flights, and cruise lines
booked extra hotel rooms and delayed ship departures as the tourism
industry made do.
   The shock for travelers was lessened somewhat by the diversity of
airlines passing through South Florida, a brief lull in vacations
before Easter weekend and the weeks of warning about the strike for
travel agents and competing airlines.
   ``We really haven't felt it because there are so many airlines
going in and out of Miami,'' said travel agent Barry White. ``It
could be a shaking out that could make things more efficient.''
   Officials at Miami International Airport are seeing daily
adjustments as competitors take advantage of Eastern's misfortune.
Overall, the travel industry seemed to have adjusted to Eastern-less
skies over Florida and the Caribbean.
   ``Continental has increased operations from 17 to 34 (flights
daily). ... I know United has expanded, American has expanded
positions here,'' said Dick Judy, director of Dade County's Aviation
Department, which operates Miami International Airport.
   Caribbean travel is largely unaffected because most islands are
served by more than one carrier or can be reached through Puerto
Rico connections, Judy said.
   Eastern carried about 2 million passengers a year to 15
destinations in the Caribbean.
   A total of 413 passengers had Eastern tickets Saturday coming off
the 1,800-passenger Norway in Miami. They were taken to a hotel
while new arrangements were made.
   ``Some of them went to the pool and were enjoying the amenities
of the hotel. They were in pretty good spirits,'' said Fran Sevcik,
spokeswoman for Kloster Cruise Ltd., which operates Norwegian Cruise
Line and Royal Viking Line. ``Of course, getting off a seven-day
cruise helps.''
   But she said the strike altered the relationship between her
company and Eastern, which had been one of the top three airlines
carrying Norwegian cruise ship passengers in and out of Miami.
   ``Until all of their labor contracts are agreed upon, we would
not even consider using them now,'' Ms. Sevcik said Wednesday.
``We'd cross that bridge when we came to it.''
   Robert Joedicke, an airline specialist with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Eastern's competitors are making contingency plans
but won't make long-term adjustments until Eastern's future is
decided.
   Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, which relied on Eastern for up to 60
percent of its passengers, changed travel plans for 3,000 people,
spent more than $50,000 on hotel rooms, had full crews working
overnight on rebookings and were unable to accommodate only three
people last weekend, said spokesman Richard Steck.
   Norwegian's Norway left port 7{ hours late Saturday, but no one
canceled, Ms. Sevcik said.
   ``It gets easier and easier,'' Steck said. ``We're buying space
into the future to replace the Eastern space, but we have the luxury
of time on our side.''
   Carnival Cruise Lines, the industry leader, is ``putting all our
passengers, obviously, on non-Eastern flights,'' said spokesman Tim
Gallagher. ``We got them all here last weekend, and we're confident
we'll get them all here this weekend.''
   Service to Latin America is more difficult to adjust because of
treaty agreements, but Pan Am is competitive in several markets that
Eastern served, Judy said.
   ``Latin America has been one of the areas where Eastern has grown
tremendously in the last two years,'' said company spokeswoman
Virginia Sanchez, estimating the airline carried 700,000 passengers
last year.

<HEAD>Denver Voters To Decide Airport Issue May 16</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An election will be held May 16 to decide whether
to build a $3 billion Denver airport, Mayor Federico Pena announced
Wednesday.
   ``We have heard from hundreds and hundreds of Denver residents
who have indicated support for the airport, but want to vote on
it,'' the mayor said.
   Pena and several council members had opposed holding an election.
But this week, concerns mounted that a petition drive to force a
referendum could push back the project's construction timetable and
upset financing arrangements.
   Pena said the vote's outcome would be considered binding on city
government, even though the city is ready to break ground this
summer on the airport, the nation's biggest such project in 15 years.
   He said the referendum would not delay groundbreaking. Completion
of the airport is scheduled for 1993.
   The airport would be about 15 miles northeast of Denver and would
replace Stapleton International Airport, one of the nation's busiest.

<HEAD>Snake Expert, Recovering From Viper Bite, Released From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A herpetologist bitten by a deadly viper a
week ago was released from the University of Utah Health Sciences
Center Wednesday, but will be closely monitored, a spokesman said.
   William Haast, 78, has been bitten by snakes 148 times during his
career as a venom researcher. He has built up immunity to the venom
of dozens of snakes, but became ill after being bitten on the hand
Feb. 28 by a Pakistani pit viper.
   After treatment with antivenin flown in from the San Diego Zoo
was less effective than expected, a worldwide effort was launched,
with the help of the Bush administration, to obtain more antivenin.
   Serums came from England, Iran and the Soviet Union, but were not
used because doctors feared possible side effects and because Haast
appeared finally to be recovering.
   ``He will contintue to be treated and seen by physicians on an
out-patient basis,'' hospital spokesman John Dwan said.
   Haast is director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
university's nearby research park. He keeps an estimated 1,000
poisonous snakes at the lab, where venom is extracted for research
and the manufacture of antivenins.

<HEAD>Soviets Accept World Court Authority In Human Rights Treaties</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs with details, comment from U.S. official.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced on Wednesday
that it will accept the authority of the World Court in major human
rights treaties, ending 40 years of resistance to the court's
jurisdiction.
   State Department officials hailed the move as a step toward an
eventual agreement under which Moscow would join Washington in
accepting the court's rulings in all but the most sensitive
political and national security cases.
   The U.N. legal office released a letter from Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar withdrawing Soviet reservations to human rights treaties.
   The Soviet Union had signed the treaties but added the
reservation that it did not accept World Court authority in disputes.
   The World Court, formally known as the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, is the main judicial body of the United
Nations. It has no powers of enforcement, but its rulings carry a
major moral impact on world opinion.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union would recognize the binding
jurisdiction of the court in these human rights treaties:
   _The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide;
   _The 1949 Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in
Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitutions of Others;
   _The 1952 Convention on the Political Rights of Women;
   _The 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination;
   _The 1979 Convention on the Elimination All Forms of
Discrimination Against Women;
   _The 1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or
Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
   Shevardnadze's letter suggested the Soviet Union will agree to
the court's authority in all human rights cases.
   He noted that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1988
suggested before the General Assembly that ``all states recognize
the binding jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice with
respect to the interpretation and application of human rights
agreements.''
   A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, noted that Soviet legal writers previously said the Court
is dominated by Western influences.
   Shevardnadze's letter ``may indicate their seriousness in
accepting the court's jurisdiction in a greater range of cases,''
the official said. ``It is a major step.''
   The United States has been suggesting that the Soviets, Britain,
France and China join it in agreeing to accept the court's
jurisdiction except in cases involving national security or the use
of force.
   That would avoid cases like Nicaragua's 1986 dispute with
Washington, in which the Sandinista government contended the United
States was illegally mining its harbors and supporting the Contra
rebels. The U.S. government refused to honor a World Court ruling
that sided with the Sandinistas.

<HEAD>N.C. Nuclear Plant Shuts Down Unit After Small Radioactive Gas Leak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operators at the McGuire nuclear plant
shut down one of the plant's two units after a small amount of
radioactive gas leaked into the air from a steam generator tube.
   The company said Wednesday the leak never posed a threat to
employees or the public.
   ``Things are well under control,'' said Mike Mullen, a spokesman
for Duke Power Co., which owns the plant. ``We're still under a
state of alert purely as a conservative measure until the
temperature (of the water inside the unit) can be cooled down.''
   An alert, the second-least serious emergency classification, was
declared at 11:45 p.m. Tuesday at the plant by Duke officials, who
began shutting down Unit 1 a minute later. Duke alerted state and
local authorities at 12:01 a.m.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said all safety systems
functioned normally during the event.
   Mullen said the leak occurred at 11:37 p.m. Tuesday, apparently
in one or more of the 4,600 tubes inside each of the four steam
generators that are used to make electricity in the plant's two
nuclear units.
   The leak contaminated an undetermined amount of water and allowed
a small amount of radioactive gas to escape from an auxiliary
building adjacent to the turbine building, he said.
   The gas leak lasted less than 10 minutes, Mullen said.
   Mullen said minute releases of radioactive materials occasionally
occur at nuclear power plants and are strictly monitored by federal
officials. The amount released Tuesday night was well within those
guidelines, he said.
   Mullen said the leak was under investigation.
   The unit could be shut down for weeks as the expensive repairs
are made, said Mullen. ``This will require cleaning up the secondary
side where the contamination occurred,'' he said. ``We also will
have to repair the tubes.''
   The biggest job Wednesday afternoon was cleaning up the
contaminated water, the spokesman said.
   The NRC said it was sending a team to investigate the incident.

   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
approved legislation Wednesday to gradually raise the minimum wage
$1.30 an hour to $4.65 after rejecting a Bush administration plan
for a smaller increase coupled with a reduced ``training wage.''
   President Bush has said he would veto legislation raising the
minimum above $4.25 an hour and told GOP leaders Wednesday that, in
the words of press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, his proposal ``is
fair and firm and his last offer.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, the labor committee chairman, said he was
hopeful ``we can reach a compromise that is fairer to the working
poor and that President Bush will sign.''
   Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said the full Senate could
consider the measure next week. ``We're all set to go to the floor
right away,'' he said. ``I think we'll have strong support.''
   The minimum wage, now $3.35 an hour, has not been raised in eight
years.
   Kennedy said he is ``glad to listen'' to Republican calls for a
sub-minimum wage, but only if it is coupled with specific
requirements for training and education.
   Kennedy predicted a veto would be overridden.
   ``We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' he said. ``If
it's the judgment that (Bush will) veto it, we'll override it,''
Kennedy told reporters after the meeting.
   The committee approved the $1.30 increase on an 11-5 vote, with
Republican Sens. David Durenberger of Minnesota and James Jeffords
of Vermont voting with the panel's nine Democrats. The approval came
after Democrats, joined by Durenberger, rejected the White House
proposal to raise the hourly minimum 30 cents each year for three
years, to $4.25.
   The House subcommittee on labor standards has scheduled a
Thursday meeting to draft legislation similar to Kennedy's bill.
Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee, plans to have the full panel consider the $4.65 an
hour minimum wage, which he has said he strongly supports.
   Bush's proposal, long opposed by Democrats and organized labor,
would establish a ``training wage'' of $3.35 an hour, the current
minimum for all workers, and allow employers to pay newly hired
workers at that rate for their first six months on the job.
   While opposition to the sub-miminum wage has softened, Kennedy
said Wednesday that such a category would have to be sharply limited
from what the administration wants.
   ``I'm not going to see the corruption of the minimum wage by
using the words `training wage' to throw older workers out of work
and displace those who want to work 40 hours a week,'' Kennedy said.
   ``I'm open to listening, to having the educational components
outlined,'' he added. ``There was nothing in the administration
proposal that had an educational component.''
   He said such a plan would also have to be limited to first-time
workers and be for a shorter duration than six months.
   Kennedy, while noting the administration's threatened veto,
agreed that Bush's call for an increase in the minimum wage had
boosted chances that some increase will soon be approved.
   ``This administration has been more forthcoming than the previous
eight years,'' the senator said.
   The committee approved three amendments to the bill Kennedy
introduced.
   The first mirrors a provision in the White House plan to raise
the level at which small businesses are exempted from minimum wage
provisions from gross annual sales of $362,000 to $500,000.
   Another proposal, also supported by Bush, would raise from 40
percent to 50 percent the so-called tip credit. Employers are
allowed to count a certain percentage of tips toward the reported
salaries of workers covered by the minimum wage.
   The committee also accepted a proposal to extend federal minimum
wage standards to Puerto Rico.

<HEAD>Communist Party Calls for Investigation of Stalinism in Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist party leaders have ordered an
evaluation of Stalinist crimes in Poland and an analysis of the
``cult'' that surrounded Poland's 1950s leader, Boleslaw Bierut, the
state news agency said Wednesday.
   The leaders also called for ways to eliminate remnants of
Stalinism and urged ``political and moral compensation for actions
of lawlessness and wrongs sustained by citizens in the Stalinist
era,'' PAP reported without elaborating.
   PAP said the comments were made at a Tuesday meeting of the
Politburo, which ``deemed it necessary to make a comprehensive and
in-depth analysis of postulates concerning the activity of Boleslaw
Bierut and the symbols of his cult.''
   Bierut, a slight mustachioed man who was installed as the Polish
leader on Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's orders, directed the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party from 1948 until his death in Moscow
in 1956 after attending the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union.
   Bierut became ill at the congress, where Stalin, his mentor who
died in 1953, was denounced by then-Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
   After Bierut died, he was replaced by a populist communist
leader, Wladyslaw Gomulka, who introduced a political thaw and
released thousands of people jailed for alleged political crimes
while Bierut was in power.
   The victims included many members of the underground resistance
army that fought the Nazi occupiers during World War II.
   In recent weeks, in line with the attacks on Stalinism in the
Soviet Union, there have been increasingly critical articles about
Bierut in the official press and proposals to rename Bierut
University in Wroclaw and the Bierut Steel Mill in Czestochowa.

<HEAD>NOAA Scientists Detect Minor Storm from Solar Flare</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A magnetic wave spewed from the sun on Monday
during a massive solar flare was detected Wednesday on Earth, but
federal experts said it arrived as a ``minor storm'' that should
have only small effects on communications.
   Forecaster Norman Cohen, at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Space Environment Services Center in Boulder,
Colo., said instruments detected a proton event, rapidly followed by
a geomagnetic storm starting at about 12:30 p.m. EST.
   He said both events originated from the solar flare that occurred
on the eastern edge of the sun on Monday. Cohen said the radiation
and geomagnetism from the flare were small, from the Earth's
perspective, because of the angle of emission from the sun.
   ``Had the flare been in the western half of the sun, it could
have caused serious problems,'' he said.
   The sunspot region that spawned the flare, however, is moving
farther west as the sun rotates and should be in a position by
Monday to pose a greater radiation hazard to Earth if another
eruption occurs, said Cohen.
   ``If it blew up on us then, it could be quite exciting,'' he said.
   NOAA experts said the sunspot region that produced the large
flare continues to be active and that there is a 50 percent chance
that another flare will occur before the region rotates out of view
over the western limb, or horizon, of the sun.
   Cohen said the proton event, which had been forecast for Tuesday,
arrived at Earth later than expected because of the eastern location
of the flare on the sun. Protons originating from flares are high
energy particles that can damage electronics on satellites. Cohen
said the event detected Wednesday was too small to cause such
problems.
   Warnings were sent, however, to power and telephone companies
about the geomagnetic storm, he said. He said the storm, though
classified as minor, could cause a slight electrical surge on long
utility lines at high latitudes.
   Geomagnetic bursts also can trigger brilliant displays of the
aurora, or polar lights, and Cohen forecast, ``There should be
increased activities at both poles.''
   Monday's flare was classified as an X-15, the largest since April
1984. X-rays from the flare were so powerful that they overloaded
instruments on NOAA satellites that measure solar activity up to a
level of X-12. A small flare, classed as an X-1, occurred Tuesday.
   Solar flares are eruptions that burst suddenly from the face of
the sun, sending waves of electromagnetic radiation and charged
particles out into space.
   A burst of X-rays, which crosses the nearly 93 million miles
between Earth and the sun in just eight minutes, was detected about
9:05 a.m. EST Monday. It disrupted a Coast Guard Loran navigation
system and some short wave radio communications, officials said.
   Goddard Space Center officials said the Solar Max Satellite,
monitored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, also
detected the flare on Monday. No problems were reported on any of
the 21 satellites monitored by Goddard.
   The sun goes through phases of intense activity. It passed a low
point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in
intensity later this year or early in 1990.

   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., proposed
legislation Wednesday that would set a $1,000 fine and a one-year
term in jail for anyone displaying the American flag on the floor or
ground.
   The proposal by Montgomery, chairman of the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, would expand a 1968 law providing penalties for
publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling the
flag.
   Montgomery said he was angered by a Chicago art exhibit.
``Citizens throughout the country desire that the flag be treated
with great respect,'' he said. ``It certainly does not belong on the
floor.''
   An exhibit at the School of Art Institute in Chicago consists of
the flag, a wall display of pictures of flag-draped caskets, South
Koreans burning the flag and a ``Yankees go home'' sign; and a
ledger for comments on a shelf below the photos. Veterans say the
exhibit invites viewers to trample the flag as they go to the ledger.

   Four plant workers and two subcontractor
employees at a uranium processing plant showed high levels of
uranium contamination in urine samples last year, the U.S.
Department of Energy said.
   However, U.S. Rep. Thomas Luken questioned the validity of the
urine tests and asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to
return its inspectors to the plant at Fernald.
   The EPA yanked the inspectors from the plant last December after
independent urine tests showed that they, too, had been contaminated
by uranium.
   The plant 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati processes uranium for
the Energy Department, which uses it elsewhere to make nuclear
weapons.
   Pulling the inspectors, Luken said, needlessly alarmed some plant
workers and prompted the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and
some companies which serve the facility to pull out their
representatives.
   Luken received a letter Tuesday from James A. Reafsnyder, the
Energy Department manager at the plant. It said the four plant
workers and two subcontractor employees were the only ones who
showed high levels of uranium contamination among 7,300 people who
were tested at the plant.
   The letter said the six showed readings above 35 micrograms of
uranium oxide dust per liter, a level considered a health hazard.
Subsequent urine samples did not show unhealthful levels, Reafsnyder
said.
   He also told Luken that 20 plant workers had test results showing
uranium levels which were lower but still above safety levels. Those
workers were reassigned to other areas.
   In his subsequent letter to the EPA, Luken said the agency's
``partial quarantine'' was an arbitrary decision and told EPA
Administrator William Reilly the ban should be lifted at once.
   ``EPA has been cavalier in advising its own employees to stay
away and leaving everyone else in a quandary,'' said Luken.
   EPA spokeswoman Anne Rowan in Chicago said the agency is still
reviewing results of tests on the two inspectors and plans to
announce early next week whether it will allow its inspectors to
return to the plant.
   The agency also has asked a new laboratory to conduct future
tests.
   Meanwhile, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that internal memos
show that underground ponds of radioactive water have formed beneath
three more buildings at the Fernald plant, posing a threat to water
supplies as well as to the buildings.
   Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, which operates the plant for the
Energy Department, said it has begun efforts to remedy the problems.
   Graham Mitchell, Fernald team manager for the Ohio EPA, said the
information was no surprise. The underground pools could seep
through the ground and contaminate drinking-water supplies for a
wide area, Mitchell said.
   Reafsnyder said that clay under the plant seems to have confined
the contamination.

<HEAD>Arafat Lays Cornerstone For Palestinian Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat laid the cornerstone of a Palestinian embassy in
Pakistan on Wednesday. President Hafez Assad of Syria denounced the
PLO chairman's new peaceful image, declaring that concessions never
``win back rights.''
   Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's defense minister, said attempts by
radical PLO factions to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon were
``clear-cut terror'' despite remarks to the contrary attributed to
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   A senior Palestine Liberation Organization official said in
Amman, Jordan, the Israeli army should expect retaliation for
attacks on Palestinians. He added, however, that the PLO will
continue the moderate position it has taken since Arafat renounced
terrorism in December and recognized Israel.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the only Arab country to make
peace with Israel, begins a three-nation European tour Thursday
focused on Western Europe's role in Middle East peace efforts and
its economic aid to Egypt.
   Pakistan was the first country to recognize the independent state
declared in November by the Palestine National Council, which acts
as the PLO legislature.
   Aafat said to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, the first woman to
lead a Moslem country: ``We know for freedom there is a very high
price. As you have paid for your freedom, we will continue to pay
for ours.''
   More than 100 foreign diplomats and dignitaries attended the
ceremony.
   Assad, in Damascus, did not mention Arafat by name, but declared
in a clear reference that ``the policy of free concessions never led
anyone to win back his rights.''
   ``Whatever such concessions produce they will never achieve
anything because in the end Syria will say no,'' the president said.
``The policy of concessions is very far from our political and
doctrinal thinking.''
   He was addressing a rally for the 26th anniversary of the Baath
Socialist Party's rise to power. Assad, an air force captain in
1963, became president in 1971.
   Assad has opposed previous efforts by Arafat to negotiate with
Israel and has feuded with the PLO chairman since 1983.
   Syria is prepared to attend an international peace conference on
the Middle East, he said, but accused Israeli leaders of
``deliberate intentions of perpetual aggression.''
   Rabin told reporters at an army base in northern Israel the
guerrillas who tried to enter Israel did so ``with the purpose to
inflict damage, killing, maybe taking hostages.''
   ``What we have experienced in the last few months is clear-cut
terror,'' he said. ``If this is not terror, I don't know what is
terror.''
   A senior State Department official quoted Baker on Tuesday as
concluding the attempted raids were not acts of terrorism requiring
a break in American contacts with the PLO.
   ``We make a mistake if we define that too closely,'' he said of
Baker's view about the PLO and terrorism.
   Washington began a dialogue with the PLO after Arafat's
declaration in December.
   Mahmoud Abbas, a member of the PLO executive committee, said
raids from Lebanon are aimed at military targets and do not violate
the renunciation of terror.
   ``We did not mean that armed struggle is a form of terroris,'' he
said in the Jordanian capital. ``The Israeli army, which is killing
our children and raiding our camps, should expect retaliation.''
   He added, however: ``We will not go back on our political
position.''
   Mubarak's tour begins in Belgium and includes visits to the
Netherlands and West Germany.
   In the Netherlands, he will attend a conference on atmospheric
pollution and confer on the side with a major participant, President
Francois Mitterrand of France.
   Osama el-Baz, his chief political adviser, said Mubarak has ``two
major aims: to benefit Egypt's development, economic reform and
bilateral ties and to give a new push to peace efforts.''

<HEAD>New Orleans Symphony Resumes Concerts After One-Year Layoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New Orleans Symphony, silenced more than a
year ago with a nearly $4 million debt, set the premiere of its new
season Wednesday with a sold-out concert under the baton of
conductor Maxim Shostakovich.
   ``Fanfare For A New Beginning,'' composed by orchestra member
Richard Harrison, will launch the program.
   Also set for the opening were a balloon drop, a party and
fireworks.
   ``I think it's out of danger now,'' said Ronald W. Jones, who
took over in December as president of the symphony board. ``We have
a new emphasis on fund raising and marketing. The symphony has put
together a premier organization.
   ``In a way, the closing of the symphony focused everyone's
attention on the problem and made people determined to keep it from
happening,'' said Jones, who is also president of Louisiana
Coca-Cola Bottling.
   The symphony suspended operations Jan. 16, 1988, almost $4
million in debt.
   The financial crisis had been building for years, blamed on
mismanagement before a professional manager was hired in 1986.
Despite desperate ``save the symphony'' fund drives, musicians
walked out in 1985 and 1987 when they weren't paid, and drastic
budget cuts led to dwindling public support.
   After the 1988 spring season was canceled, a new symphony
organization took over.
   Donations of $225,000, earmarked for the symphony if it reopened,
will pay off the remaining debts and leave the books in the black
Thursday morning, Jones said.
   The symphony's home, the ornate Orpheum Theater, was sold to
eliminate $2.4 million of the debt. The buyers, whose names have not
been made public, have agreed to let the symphony play rent free for
the next five years.
   Lending encouragement to symphony officials was an unexpected
surge in public support. Two-thirds of the season tickets for the
12-week spring program have been sold, although officials had
considered a one-third sale a mark of success.
   It is the 53rd season for the symphony and the third as music
director for Shostakovich, son of the late Russian composer Dmitri
Shostakovich.

   In a bittersweet tribute to the start of the
Northeast Shuttle, Eastern Airlines on Wednesday made a desperate
attempt to lure passengers back to the service they pioneered in
1961 by offering $12 one-way weekend fares and $49 one-way weekday
fares.
   ``This is a move to generate revenue right now for Eastern
Airlines,'' said George Brennan, vice president for marketing. ``We
have to breathe the life of passenger revenues into that operation.''
   The fares recall the $12 ticket offered in happier times 18 years
ago when Eastern introduced the original concept in commuter air
travel between major cities in the Northeast. The current fare is
$99 one-way on weekdays and from $69 to $99 one-way on weekends.
   The company will run full-page newspaper ads, as well as radio
spots, in Boston, New York and Washington this week in hopes of
bringing customers home.
   Competitor Pan Am Corp. said it would not slash fares to match,
and spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon reacted to Eastern's play on its old
fare: ``We've definitely got a 1989 product.''
   She noted that most shuttle passengers are business travelers who
aren't sensitive to fare changes. ``It is a businessman's market;
it's a must-go market.''
   Brennan denied the action was aimed at protecting the pending
$365 million sale of the shuttle service to New York developer
Donald Trump.
   He said Eastern wants to at least keep its 62 daily shuttle
flights, which normally carry 6,500 to 8,000 passengers, operating
during the Machinists strike, which began Saturday and nearly shut
down the airline because pilots have honored picket lines.
   The public's confusion has resulted in some Eastern shuttle
flights this week with as few as six passengers.
   ``I can guarantee you we're not making money at $12, but I can
tell you at no dollars we're making less,'' he said.
   The newspaper ads invite people to: ``Fly the original shuttle at
the original price _ $12 one way. We're back.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said shuttle passengers are not at
risk of being stranded by a bankrupt airline because bankruptcy is
still a last resort.
   Another spokesman, James Ashlock, said Eastern has pulled
television ads and canceled other promotions since the strike.
Advance bookings are ``near zero,'' said Joseph Leonard, executive
vice president.
   Besides its shuttle, Eastern's only other service is a
thrice-weekly roundtrip between Miami and the South American cities
of Buenos Aires and Santiago. That route requires little promotion
even in normal times because of limited competition.

<HEAD>Israeli Think Tank Calls For PLO Talks, Possible Palestinian State</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with five grafs to UPDATE with government reaction, quotes.
Picks up 3rd pvs, `The study...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An Israeli think tank on Wednesday urged
the government to negotiate with the PLO and said that with adequate
security arrangements, a Palestinian state would not pose a deadly
threat to Israel.
   The report set off a ruckus in the government. The right-wing
Likud bloc and the center-left Labor Party have governed Israel in
an uneasy coalition since elections in July 1984 and again in
November 1988 ended in stalemates.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the Likud, said the
study undermines Israel's efforts to resist U.S. and European
pressures to talk with the PLO, Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimeir said.
   But Finance Minister and Labor Party leader Shimon Peres called
the study ``intelligent'' and said Israel must speak to Palestinian
representatives, Israel television said.
   Joseph Alpher, director of the 20-member team that produced the
study and a separate paper of recommendations, said, ``Israel can
set conditions on its agreement, but it is going to have to talk to
the PLO to solve the problem under the present circumstances.''
   The study by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   In the peace proposal entitled ``Toward A Solution,'' the
independent think tank proposed a lengthy period of autonomy for the
1.7 million Palestinian residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip as a precursor to possible statehood.
   ``We are talking about a 10- to 15-year process that begins with
a series of confidence-building measures and new concepts on the
part of both parties,'' Alpher said.
   The 24-page proposal conflicts with government policy ruling out
talks with the PLO and rejecting any possibility of a Palestinian
state. The proposed transition period is considerably longer than
the five-year interim period suggested by the 1978 Camp David
Accords.
   Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat advocates
an immediate turnover and predicted in a recent interview that a
Palestinian state would emerge in two years.
   The center recommended Israel should not commit itself to a
Palestinian state in advance. But it urged Israel not rule out the
possibility, noting that with proper security arrangements the
concept of a Palestinian state was not a ``mortal danger'' to the
Jewish state.
   To win Palestinian confidence, Israel would have to offer
comprehensive self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, give up
control over most state land in occupied zones and stop building
Jewish settlements.
   Palestinians would have to cease violent acts and terrorism
against Israeli targets and accept that Palestinian refugees would
not be able to return to Israel.
   In an interview, Alpher said the PLO also would have to agree to
Israel keeping some Arab land seized in the 1967 Middle East war and
to limitations on the sovereignty of a new state, including Israel's
control of its airspace.
   The 235-page study said 2.2 million of the world's 4.6
Palestinians live in Arab states, half of them in teeming refugee
camps.
   It says the sudden and unplanned movement of refugees to a new
state posed a serious danger of economic collapse, social chaos and
renewed guerrilla insurgency against Israel.
   The center proposed that during an interim period Arab states
begin resettling the camp residents on their own territory and that
only a portion of the refugees move to a new Palestine state.
   The study says the sudden separation of Israel and the West Bank
would cause economic hardship for both sides, with Israel losing
workers and an export market while 100,000 Palestinians would lose
their jobs in Israel.
   An initial investment of up to $2.5 billion would be needed for
building basic industry, electricity, roads and a port in Gaza.
About $2 billion would be needed annually for several years to
prevent a drop in living standards, it said.
   The study says Israel, which receives about $3 billion annually
in U.S. aid, would need additional funds. Up to $10 billion would be
needed to resettle 20,000 Israeli settlers, withdraw Israeli troops,
relocate military facilities and erect an electronic border fence.
   The report's authors included an ex-director of military
intelligence, a former head of the military government in the West
Bank and a well-known conservative scholar.

<HEAD>Convention Leaves Open Rights of Unborn</HEAD>
<UNK>By HANNS NEUERBOURG ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.N. Human Rights Commission on Wednesday
approved a draft convention on the rights of children that leaves
open the legal status of the unborn.
   A Red Cross spokesman said the wording of the convention, which
is subject to approval by the U.N. General Assembly, would weaken
international laws against employing children in war-related
activities.
   Approval by the 43-nation panel came without a vote after many
speakers welcomed the draft but also listed reservations. Poland's
Adam Lopatka, who headed the negotiations on the project since they
began in 1978, told the commission it was the ``product of
compromises.''
   He cited specifically the draft's definition of a child. Article
1 defines as a child everyone below age 18 unless legal adulthood is
attained earlier under national law. Another article has signatories
recognizing that ``every child has the inherent right to life.''
   The preamble of the draft refers to a 1959 U.N. General Assembly
Declaration on the Rights of the Child ``before as well as after
birth.'' Ireland and West Germany led the fight for including the
preamble.
   But Lopatka said no consensus was possible on whether to include
a reference to the unborn child in the convention's articles. He
said negotiators faced ``principal divergence of views on this
issue'' and decided to leave it open to national legislation.
   In daylong debate, West Germany's Richard Jaeger said it was
``the first time that the rights of the unborn child are recognized
in an international convention.'' China's Li Zuomin said his
government interpreted the definition of a child as ``not including
a fetus before birth.''
   Several speakers expressed concern at another key article which
commits signatories to ``take all feasible measures to ensure that
persons who have not attained the age of 15 do not take a direct
part in hostilities.''
   Australia, Belgium and Sweden were among those criticizing that
this offers less protection than existing international norms,
including an additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions which
says that children under 15 ``must not be allowed'' to take part in
hostilities.
   The observer of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
speaking last, said the draft's article ``even weakens international
humanitarian law and introduces ambiguities.''
   The draft's 54 articles include many basic human rights already
laid down in other internationally binding accords. Specific
provisions commit signatories to protect children against ``all
forms of sexual exploitation'' and to prevent ``the abduction, sale
of or trafficking in children.''
   One article includes a reference to children's right to ``receive
and impart information of all kinds ... through any media of the
child's choice'' but adds that this right may be ``subject to
certain restrictions.''
   The West German delegate commented that ``a clarification taking
into account parents' rights would have been urgently required
because I am sure that no one in this room believes that children
should be allowed to watch TV for unlimited hours.''
   Australia's Quentin Bryce said that concern voiced by some
parents that the accord may undermine their relationship with their
children was unfounded. ``The convention makes abundantly clear the
primary responsibility of parents for their children,'' she said.
   The General Assembly will have to decide on funds needed for
setting up a special committee that is to monitor implementation of
the convention.

<HEAD>Meryl Streep, Apple Industry Trade Barbs Over Alar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Meryl Streep and the Washington
apple industry squared off in a bicoastal battle Wednesday over the
movie star's talk show appearances warning against eating
Alar-treated apples.
   Ms. Streep has little scientific knowledge about the chemical
daminozide, sold under the name Alar, and should not go on
television denouncing it, said Chris Schlect, a Washington fruit
industry lobbyist based in Yakima.
   The Academy Award-winning actress, a founder of the group Mothers
and Others for Pesticide Limits, has appeared on the ``Today'' and
``Donahue'' shows and other programs recently denouncing the use of
Alar.
   ``She is not a Ph.D. from Harvard,'' said Schlect, head of the
Northwest Horticultural Council. ``She is not knowledgeable about
why (farmers) use products or what would happen if they were not
(used).''
   Ms. Streep acknowledged her lack of scientific training in an
interview Wednesday, but said that was not the issue.
   ``I'm not a scientist so I have to go with the best information
available,'' Ms. Streep told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview from her agent's office in New York. ``I eat them and I
feed them (to her three children) so I am involved in the apple
issue.''
   ``I'm not interested in beating up on farmers. I'm interested in
farmers being supported to grow in ways not threatening to health,''
said Ms. Streep, whose group is tied in with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, a Washington-based non-profit consumer watchdog
agency.
   Although the safety of Alar has been debated for years, the
latest flareup began Feb. 26 when the CBS news program ``60
Minutes'' aired a story on a report by the NRDC titled ``Intolerable
Risk: Pesticides In Our Children's Food.''
   The NRDC released the report the next day, saying that 5,500 to
6,200 preschoolers were projected to get cancer sometime in their
lives as a result of childhood exposure to six to eight chemicals
used in fruits and vegetables.
   The report found the greatest risk from UDMH, a breakdown product
of daminozide, also known as Alar. Preschoolers consume six times
more fruit than the average adult, and the NRDC estimated that the
average preschooler's cancer risk from exposure to UDMH in their
first six years was approximately one case for every 4,000
preschoolers exposed.
   That report touched off an uproar in the apple industry and also
among some scientists and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
who said it was misleading and alarmist.
   Alar is not a pesticide. It is a chemical growth regulator that
is sprayed on apple trees after they blossom. It works internally to
improve the color and firmness of apples, mainly by keeping them on
the tree longer. That extends shelf life and also gives growers a
longer harvest time, which can be critical in times of labor
shortage.
   The EPA proposed a ban on Alar earlier this decade, although it
did not go through with that. However, the EPA announced earlier
this year that it planned to take steps towards banning Alar by 1990
because of the results of preliminary cancer tests on rats.
   To combat the TV blitz by Ms. Streep and the NRDC, the Washington
Apple Commission, a grower-financed group, announced Wednesday that
it had spent $1 million on full-page ads that will appear Friday in
New York, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles papers, as well as USA
Today.
   ``It's unfortunate she's using the emotions she can evoke in
consumers ... against products and making opinions not based on
fact,'' commission spokeswoman Vicky Scharlau said of Ms. Streep.
   Washington is the nation's leading apple producer, growing about
half of the nation's supermarket apples.
   Also Wednesday, the head of the American Council on Science and
Health said groups calling for an end to chemicals in farming are
naive and ``a major national threat to security.''
   Dr. Elizabeth Whelan of the New York-based group of 250
scientists said abandoning chemicals would leave the nation's food
supply vulnerable to the whims of nature.
   ``Meryl Streep is not going to tell them (the public) the
consequences of not using Alar,'' Ms. Whelan said, adding that
nature is full of carcinogens and that Alar has not been proven to
cause cancer.
   The earlier Alar controversy had prompted the apple industry to
severely cut its use of Alar, fearing a consumer backlash. The Apple
Commission has said only about 5 percent of the total apple acreage
is treated with the chemical.
   Ms. Streep said the 5 percent figure may not be accurate.
   She noted that Consumer Reports magazine found Alar in 23 of 32
apple juice samples it tested last year, although all the producers
contended they use Alar-free apples.
   Schlect argued that the Alar content in the apple juice samples
was below the allowable federal limits and was left-over traces from
past Alar use.

<TEXT>
   The National Electoral Board on
Wednesday recognized Paraguay's most popular opposition party,
ending a 12-year ban and allowing its participation in national
elections set for May 1.
   Since it was founded in 1977, the opposition Authentic Radical
Liberal Party was denied legal status by the government of Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner, who was deposed by Gen. Andres Rodriguez in a
Feb. 3 coup.
   ``We are euphoric,'' said the party's political secretary,
Adalberto Mongelos. ``It's a step in the right direction.''
   The Authentic Radical Liberal Party is one of three parties in
the opposition coalition National Accord, which has yet to decide
whether it will participate in the May 1 elections.
   Members of the National Accord are urging the government to
revoke an electoral statute that allows the party receiving the
majority of votes to automatically be granted a two-thirds majority
in the house of deputies and senate.
   The coalition also seeks equal representation on the Electoral
Board, whose nine members include six representatives of the ruling
Colorado Party and three members of two token opposition parties
that have particpated in previous elections.
   The president of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Domingo
Laino, is considered a likely presidential candidate to run against
Rodriguez, who named himself provisional president on Feb. 3 and is
all but certain to be the candidate for the Colorado Party.

   President Bush said Wednesday he will nominate
John Tuck, a longtime associate of former White House chief of staff
Howard Baker, to be undersecretary of energy.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Tuck would succeed Donna Fitzpatrick,
who Bush said he will nominate to be assistant secretary of energy.
   Tuck came to the White House with Baker when he became chief of
staff in 1986. Tuck worked as director of the office of the chief of
staff and executive assistant to Baker.
   From 1977 until 1986, Tuck worked in the Senate for Baker and the
Republicans, and prior to that was a GOP aide in the House.
   Bush also said he will nominate David W. Mullins Jr. to be an
assistant secretary of the treasury. Mullins was a professor of
business administration at the Harvard University graduate school of
business administration.

   A change in federal regulations is being
proposed to allow swine from China to be imported in 1989 for
research purposes, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The proposal would incorporate procedures in the current
regulations so that the department's Agricultural Research Service
can import the Chinese hogs. Officials said the changes, or
protocol, could be used later by other importers.
   Under the plan, the Chinese swine would have to undergo extensive
quarantine at the department's animal import center in Key West,
Fla., to be sure the animals are free of disease, including
foot-and-mouth disease, which is present in China.
   After quarantine, the swine will be released to the USDA agency,
Iowa State University and the University of Illinois. By
crossbreeding U.S. swine with the Chinese animals, researchers hope
to improve the productivity of the American pork industry.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista newspaper claimed
Wednesday that U.S.-backed rebels based in Honduras are mobilizing
for attacks across the border.
   It cited unidentified sources ``close to the rebel leadership''
in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa. The Defense Ministry said it
had no information other than the report in Barricada, the official
newspaper of ruling leftist party.
   An estimated 11,000 of the rebels known as Contras, the bulk of
the U.S.-supported force, are in Honduran camps in the border area
with their families.
   In Honduras, Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said
Wednesday the rebel army should not be disbanded and its fighters
repatriated to Nicaragua until the Sandinista government fulfills
its promise of democratic reforms.
   That implied a longer period for dismantling the rebel force and
greater linkage to reforms in Nicaragua than suggested by an
agreement the presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras and Nicaragua signed Feb. 14.
   Lopez Contreras urged the United States to continue humanitarian
aid to the Contras while they remain in Honduras.
   ``An armed group devoid of humanitarian assistance and
concentrated on our border is a great danger to the security of
Honduras,'' he told a news conference.
   The rebels are in the border province of El Paraiso in camps near
Yamales, about 280 miles from Tegucigalpa.
   A $27 million U.S. humanitarian aid package runs out March 31.
Some members of Congress have proposed linking more aid, which
President Bush says he will request, to the Central American summit
agreement. The United States halted military aid in February 1988.
   Central American presidents agreed at the February 13-14 summit
in El Salvador to develop a plan for dismantling the Contra force
and repatriating its members or relocating them, presumably outside
the region.
   They called for international verification of the accord, which
contains provisions for early elections and democratic reforms in
Nicaragua.
   Morris Busby, special U.S. envoy to Central America, met with
Lopez Contreras and President Jose Azcona Hoyo on Tuesday night and
told them the United States wants the Contras to return to
Nicaragua, the foreign minister said.
   ``Repatriation would benefit the Contras,'' Lopez Contreras said.
``It would benefit Nicaragua because it could achieve democracy as
the condition for repatration. And Honduras wouldn't have any more
armed groups or Nicaraguan refugees in its territory. So everyone
wins.''
   Barricada said Tuesday the Contras were moving deeper into
Honduras to avoid detection by international observers, who have not
yet been deployed. Contra leaders in Miami denied the report.
   On Wednesday, the paper said 6,000 Contras commanded by former
Col. Enrique Bermudez had moved out of the jungle camps to strategic
points on the border.
   It said they were preparing for ``offensive actions'' against
Nicaraguan targets, not demobilization. The Contras have not agreed
to the summit demobilization plan.
   Bermudez said during the summit that some rebels might return to
Nicaragua and continue the war even without U.S. military aid.
   The Contras and Sandinistas signed a temporary cease-fire a year
ago and comparatively little fighting has been reported since.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan said Wednesday he would ``readily reverse'' his decision to
forfeit nearly $300,000 in severance pay if Congress and the White
House determine the money would raise no ethical concerns.
   A Senate committee is looking into the matter with the White
House after members expressed concern that Sullivan was making an
undue sacrifice by his decison not to take the payment to avoid any
potential conflicts of interest.
   ``I would readily reverse that decision because, as some of them
put it, I'm not a wealthy man,'' Sullivan said in an interview with
The Associated Press.
   ``Certainly that's a benefit that's accrued over 13{ years that I
would certainly love to be able to enjoy, especially at this
particular time in this town.'' said Sullivan, whose annual salary
dropped from $172,000 last year to $89,500 in the new job.
   But Sullivan said he would not reverse his decision until the
after the Senate Finance Committee completes its review.
   The severance pay was earned under Sullivan's contract with the
Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, which he founded. Upon his
confirmation to the Bush Cabinet last week, he stepped down as the
school's president and took an unpaid leave of absence as a
professor of medicine.
   He had asked permission to take a paid sabbatical while at HHS,
but the White House determined the school's policy on paid leave did
not meet government ethical standards.
   The Office of Government Ethics found no ethics problems with the
severance payment, but Sullivan decided to give up the money before
the White House position was formalized.
   Sullivan said his decision was in reaction to news reports at the
time that were raising questions about his request for a paid leave.
   Last week at Sullivan's confirmation hearing, members of the
Senate Finance Committee said the sacrifice was unnecessary, unfair
and could discourage others from taking government jobs.

<HEAD>Dubcek Speaks Out Against Treatment of Dissidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the former Communist
leader of Czechoslovakia, attacked his country's recent jailing of
dissidents and said no reform in Czechoslvakia is possible unless
the events of 1968 are reviewed.
   As Communist Party chief, Dubcek led the liberal reforms known as
``the Prague Spring'' which were crushed by a Soviet-led invasion in
August 1968.
   In an interview broadcast Tuesday night, Dubcek was quoted as
telling the British Broadcasting Corp. and Voice of America radio:
``It is impossible to start out on a new road unless you have looked
at everything behind you.
   ``This refusal to look the truth about 1968 in the eye is
preventing the party and maybe the leadership ... from recognizing
that it is not possible to move forward with perestroika
(restructuring of society and the economy) until you fill in the
blank spots of history.''
   Dubcek was interviewed on Feb. 24 in Czechoslovakia. A transcript
of his remarks was made available Wednesday by the BBC in London.
   He was also quoted as criticizing the jailing of playwright and
human rights activist Vaclav Havel and others after anti-government
protests were put down by police in the Czechoslovak capital in
January.
   Dubcek called the unrest a ``surface phenomenon'' caused by ``the
burden of the last 20 years,'' according to the transcript.
   Havel was given a nine-month sentence on Feb. 21. Seven other
dissidents were tried that week. One was sentenced to a year in
prison, one to nine months, and five received suspended sentences
and fines.
   All seven were charged with hooliganism after they tried to lay
flowers in memory of Jan Palach, a Czechoslovak student who burned
himself to death in 1969 to protest the 1968 invasion and the death
of reform in his homeland.
   ``There is a serious issue here and that is that this legal
system here does not adhere to the democratic rules of the game or
to the democratic rules of law,'' Dubcek reportedly said.
   On Thursday, cultural activists Ivan Jirous and Jiri Tichy face a
court in the Moravian town of Jihlava in Czechoslovakia on charges
of anti-state activity that could jail them for up to five years.
   Milos Jakes, the current Communist Party leader, and other
prominent members of the Czechoslovak leadership continue to say the
1968 invasion was justified because Dubcek's reforms threatened the
socialist system.
   The refusal to re-evaluate was reiterated in an interview
published last month in the Soviet weekly Moscow News with Zdenek
Horeni, editor of the Czechoslovak party newspaper Rude Pravo.
   Moscow News editor Yegor Yakovlev had asked pointedly whether the
time had come to re-evaluate the events of 1968.
   ``Those events are over and done with. We will not return to
their reappraisal _ at any rate our generation,'' Horeni replied.
``There is no inner need for this.''
   Indications have grown in Soviet news media of some impatience in
Moscow with Prague's refusal to introduce more reform and with its
handling of the unprecedented week of anti-government protests in

<HEAD>US Says Mozambique Rebels Get Aid from South Africa</HEAD>

   Rebels fighting the Marxist government of
Mozambique are still getting aid from South Africa, a State
Department official said Wednesday.
   But Alison Rosenberg, deputy assistant secretary for Africa, said
she didn't know the source of the money or how much was being sent.
   ``We've done our best to publicize our views in Mozambique and
we've told the South Africans of our concern,'' Ms. Rosenberg told
the House Foreign Affairs African subcommittee.
   The Mozambique National Resistance, known by its Portuguese
acronym of RENAM0, has been fighting the government for 12 years,
starting shortly after the nation won independence from Portugal.
Thousands of Portuguese colonists fled Mozambique to neighboring
South Africa and many support RENAMO.
   The Mozambique news agency AIM says 600,000 people, most of them
children, have died as a result of the fighting. Refugees estimated
at 800,000 to 1 million have fled to Malawi.
   Mozambique and Malawi are among the world's poorest countries.
The average citizen earns about $150 a year, according to the World
Bank.
   But Edward V. K. Jaycox, the bank's vice president for Africa,
listed both among the African countries where incomes are beginning
to improve after a decade or more of decline. At a news conference
Wednesday, he singled out Malawi for what he called a tremendous
performance despite the burden of caring for the refugees.
   South Africa, where the average annual income reached $1,890 in
1987, is among the most prosperous African countries.
   In 1984, Mozambique and South Africa agreed that South African
aid to the rebels would cease and Mozambique would expel guerrillas
of the African National Congress who attack South Africa.
   ``We support the accord,'' Ms. Rosenberg said.
   The Mozambique government has charged South Africa with violating
the agreement.
   Last month, U.S. officials welcomed a call by South African
Foreign Minister Pik Botha for the United States to mediate the
fighting. E. Gibson Lanpher, the State Department's top official for
southern Africa, said he wanted to find out if Botha's proposal
included RENAMO.
   Botha said he envisioned negotiations like those of last year on
southwest Africa. They included representatives of Cuba, Angola,
South Africa and U.S. mediators and resulted in an agreement that
South Africa would begin the grant of independence to Namibia on
April 1.

   Women in Europe and the Philippines protested sexual violence and
demonstrated in favor of abortion and job opportunities to mark
International Women's Day on Wednesday.
   Turkish and Greek women in war-divided Cyprus were prevented from
having their first meeting in 15 years.
   In Rome, about 4,000 people, mostly students, marched through the
historic center with banners urging passage of a sexual violence law
approved Tuesday night by the lower house of Parliament.
   Other signs demanded the resignation of Health Minister Carlo
Donat Cattin, a Christian Democrat who wants a stricter abortion law
that would permit fewer abortions.
   In Calabria, Italy, students and older women rallied to show
their disappointment that the rape and murder of a teen-ager in that
southern region last year have yet to yield a conviction.
   Pope John Paul II, at his weekly general audience at the Vatican,
said he hopes for better appreciation of women in building society
and the Roman Catholic Church. He noted the ``active presence'' of
women in political life around the world.
   Despite his encouragement of women's participation in the church,
the pope has staunchly opposed permitting women to become priests.
In September he issued a major document about women that condemned
sexual discrimination but upheld the ban on women priests.
   In Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on Wednesday
blocked plans for the first meeting since the 1974 Turkish invasion
between 60 representatives of Greek and Turkish Cypriot women's
organizations.
   The Greek Cypriot women's group said in a statement that the
Turkish Cypriot women informed them through the United Nations force
sponsoring the meeting that the Denktash government in the northern
Turkish-occupied part of the island refused to allow them to attend.
   There was no immediate comment from Denktash, who with President
George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader, is engaged in
U.N.-sponsored negotiations aimed at reunifying Cyprus.
   Despite heavy rain, 2,500 Norwegian women marched in downtown
Oslo Wednesday night. They carried signs calling for six-hour work
days and a minimum annual wage for women of $19,500.
   Activists complained that wage differences between men and women
have increased during the 1980s, despite a Norwegian equal rights
law. They also defended laws allowing women to choose abortion and
lesbians' efforts to come out of the closet, NTB said.
   In Kristiansand, Norway, pro-abortionists were met outside the
city cathedral by counter-demonstrators carrying a crucified doll
and banners saying: ``Yes to Jesus, No to Abortion.''
   In Manila, about 2,000 women marched to the presidential palace
Wednesday to denounce President Corazon Aquino for allegedly failing
to improve conditions that force thousands of Filipino women to work
as maids, strip-tease dancers and prostitutes.
   ``The poverty and oppression of Filipino women all over the world
have only worsened in the three years since Cory Aquino was
installed in office,'' said a statement distributed by marchers.
   Many of the marchers, who included farmers' wives, students and
urban professionals, carried signs demanding ``Land, homes, jobs and
equality for women.'' Some signs said ``No to AIDS, No to U.S.
Bases.''
   About 300 helmeted police armed with truncheons stood behind two
firetrucks and a row of barbed wire.
   March 8 was declared Women's Day in 1910 during an International
Socialist Women's Conference in Copenhagen and adopted by the United
Nations in 1975.

<HEAD>Gregg Says Sununu Not To Blame For State's Cash Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMA LOVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unpredictable economy, not the
stewardship of former Gov. John Sununu is responsible for New
Hampshire's cash crisis, Gov. Judd Gregg said Wednesday.
   ``I was left with a very strong state, an extremely positive
fiscal situation,'' Gregg said.
   Gregg commented in response to reports that Sununu, now White
House chief of staff, left Gregg with the same financial problems
for which Sununu denounced Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis during
the presidential campaign.
   Sununu forecast a $10 million budget surplus in his departing
speech to the Legislature in January. Five days later Gregg warned
of a potential $13 million deficit when he cut most state spending 3
percent.
   The sudden turnaround prompted Democrats to accuse Sununu of
masking a deficit to make himself look good and Dukakis bad.
   The potential deficit was based on revenue projections that are
still in debate. Also, the Legislature under-funded several programs
last spring when it wrote a supplemental budget for 1989.
   Legislative leadership said then that better revenue and cost
estimates would be available in January to use in adjusting the
estimated $571 million general fund budget. A supplemental spending
bill to ensure the state ends the year in the black is still under
consideration.
   When it appeared agencies were spending more than legislators
estimated out of their 1988 budgets, Sununu privately twisted arms
last spring to produce $24 million in lapses, appropriated but
unspent funds.
   That left the state with a $13 million surplus last July 1.
   Usually criticized for being overly cautious in his revenue
estimates, Sununu says early receipts made him feel confident the
state would take in more revenues than estimated by the Legislature
in April. Gregg's January estimate also was lower than Sununu's.
   Sununu's estimate of how much agencies would return to the
treasury on June 30 also was higher than Gregg's.
   When Gregg announced the turnaround, he deducted for under-funded
programs and used revenue and lapse estimates that were $13 million
less than those projected by Sununu.
   Gregg said in an interview last month that Sununu ``still could
have been optimistic into December'' that his estimates were correct
``and if I were a departing governor, I suspect I would have been.''
   A key element in the equation are the lapses. In his six years in
office, Sununu's taskmaster style of management produced the results
he sought.
   In an interview last week, Sununu said he felt ``we still would
have been able to manage it'' and that based on revenue estimates
when he left, a small surplus would have been left even after those
bills he felt had to be paid were deducted.
   Though he warned aggressive management would be required to
ensure any of the $10 million was left on June 30, Sununu didn't
mention the debts when he talked about a surplus.
   Critics say that painted too rosy a picture, but Sununu says they
weren't listening closely.
   ``For folks to say I didn't say revenues were tight is just not
true,'' he says. ``I was the one who said it was going to be a
tough, tough biennium.''
   Gregg reiterated Wednesday that Sununu wasn't to blame.
   ``I don't point the finger of blame at anyone,'' he said. ``I
think we are caught in a situation where revenues are falling. It
was an unpredictable situation. I don't think it was poor
management.''
   Gregg praised fellow Republican Sununu and New Hampshire's
Republican-controlled Legislature for prudent use of state funds
during Sununu's three terms as governor.
   ``We had very good stewardship over the last six years,'' he said.
   Gregg said Sununu's criticism of Masschusetts was justified.
While New Hampshire spent supluses on one-time projects, such as the
land conservation program, Dukakis spent large sums on new programs
that have to be funded or cut in lean times, he said.
   Gregg predicted the universal health care program enacted by
Massachusetts ``is going to bankrupt that state in my opinion.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Parental Leave Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee gave party-line approval
Wednesday to legislation that would require large employers to
provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to take care of
newborn or seriously ill children.
   The bill, a major part of congressional Democrats' domestic
agenda, also would require companies with 50 or more employees to
grant similar leave to workers who need extended time off to take
care of ailing parents.
   And it would require them to give up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave
for the workers' own serious illness.
   In each instance, the only direct cost to the employer would be
to continue whatever company-paid health benefits were in force at
the time the worker requested leave.
   However, many private and public employers, including the
National League of Cities, oppose the measure on grounds it would be
overly disruptive to their operations to hold jobs open for workers
requesting such extended leaves even though the direct financial
cost might be minimal.
   The measure cleared the House Education and Labor Committee on a
23-12 vote at the end of a daylong meeting in which the panel beat
back about two dozen Republican-sponsored amendments.
   The bill is expected to be scheduled for floor debate in May
after facing review by the House Post Office and Civil Service
Committee.
   Only two major amendments were adopted Wednesday _ one to include
congressional offices and another to exempt public elementary and
secondary schools from some of the measure's provisions.
   The amendment applying to public schools was sponsored by Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who offered it at the urging of the National
School Boards Association.
   She read panel members a letter from the association in which it
agreed to drop its opposition to the overall bill if the amendment
it sought was adopted.
   Arguing that whatever was fair for public schools was fair for
private schools, Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, attempted to amend
Ms. Roukema's amendment to spell that out.
   He was defeated, 25-10.
   Later, Bartlett attempted to have the bill spell out that the
same special considerations that public schools could apply to
teachers on leave _ mainly special leeway in offering them
equivalent work, rather than the same work _ would extend to police
and fire departments and public health agencies.
   Again, he was defeated, 25-10.

<TEXT>
   The justice minister appealed to
Parliament on Wednesday for a system of checks and balances to be
enshrined in Hungary's new constitution and repeatedly cited the
U.S. Constitution as an example.
   In presenting the main principles of the new constitution,
Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar said the drafters of the U.S.
Constitution faced many of the same pitfalls Hungary confronts today.
   The constitution, which would mark a significant break from the
current 1949 constitution modeled after the Soviet one, is to
guarantee civil and human rights and the existence of various
parties.
   Parliament, which began its session Wednesday, also was told by
Premier Miklos Nemeth that the government will consider calling a
referendum on its highly controversial Danube power project.
   It was the first indication Hungary might consider withdrawing
from the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project, which it is building jointly
with Czechoslovakia and with Austrian financial backing.
   Environmentalists in Hungary argue that the project will cause
irreparable damage to the river.
   A new law on referendums is due in June. It is part of a package
of political reforms designed to complement the new constitution,
which is to be adopted by referendum early next year.

   A high-speed rail link from London to the Channel
Tunnel will be built underground and through deep surface cuttings
for two-thirds of its way because of environmental protests, British
Rail announced Wednesday.
   The state network bowed to a furious campaign by residents in
southeast London and picturesque Kent, who said demolition along the
68-mile route and the noise of trains would devastate their lives.
   The changes will increase the cost of the rail link project from
$2 billion to $2.9 billion, British Rail said.
   The route won't be ready until the late 1990s, so existing
railway tracks and lower speeds on the England side will have to be
used when the Channel Tunnel now being built to link England and
France opens in 1993.

Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlantic storm packing gusts of up to 60 mph gnawed at
portions of the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Wednesday as cold,
wet weather covered most of the Eastern Seaboard.
   Cold temperature records were broken or tied in at least eight
cities in the Northeast, the South and Southwest.
   Snow fell over southeast New England, and freezing rain spread
ice over southern New Jersey and from southeast Virginia to
northeastern South Carolina.
   Snow also extended along the western portion of Lake Superior and
northeast Minnesota, and from western Wyoming across western Montana
and the Idaho panhandle.
   Rain reached from the northern half of California into southwest
Oregon.
   In North Carolina, where the eastern storm hit hardest, the end
of a motel toppled into the surf and about 40 cottages were damaged
on the Outer Banks, where beachfront residents were urged to move
into emergency shelters Wednesday night.
   A layer of ice covered much of the state, making roads so slick
that salt trucks were stopped in their tracks.
   ``This has the makings of being another Ash Wednesday storm,
which was the most severe storm on record for the Outer Banks,''
said Wally Piland of Dare County Emergency Management. The Ash
Wednesday storm hit in March 1962.
   At least three fatalities were blamed on ice-covered interstate
highways in the eastern part of North Carolina, and water sloshed
over sections of state route 12, the main route along the Outer
Banks.
   Winter weather warnings were in effect for much of North
Carolina, portions of eastern South Carolina and southeastern
Virginia.
   An advisory for snow was posted over Rhode Island.
   Advisories for snow also were posted over the higher elevations
of Calfornia's northern Sierra Nevada.
   Snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 1
inch at Duluth and Hibbing, Minn., and Missoula, Mont. Heavier
rainfall during the same six hours included about one-third of an
inch at Goldsboro, N.C.
   Record low temperatures were recorded in Albany, N.Y. (2 below
zero), Binghampton, N.Y. (2), Galveston, Texas (37), Harrisburg, Pa.
(9), Lake Charles, La. (29), Waco, Texas (26) and Williamsport, Pa.
(8).
   The low temperature for the nation was 28 below zero at Fort
Kent, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 86 at Gila Bend, Ariz.
   The national weather forecast for Thursday called for rain along
the central Atlantic coast and from the Georgia coast across
east-central Florida. Rain, with snow in higher elevations, will
extend from the northern two-thirds of the Pacific Coast across the
Great Basin and northern plateau.
   High temperatures were expected in the 30s and 40s from Maine
across North Carolina, over the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes, the
upper Mississippi Valley, the southeast half of Missouri and
northern South Dakota, North Dakota and northeast Montana.
   Temperatures were expected in the 70s over the southern Florida
peninsula. Highs in the 70s and 80s were forecast from western Texas
across New Mexico, southern Arizona, southern Nevada and much of the
southern half of California, reaching near 90 degrees through the
desert Southwest. High temperatures over the remainder of the nation
were expected to be in the 50s and 60s.

   The world within a world that biologist
Abigale Alling entered Wednesday is landlocked, high and dry in the
spectacular landscape of the desert.
   But organizers of her five-day test run in the self-contained
environment believe it could lead to the stars.
   ``I feel like a pioneer in here,'' Ms. Alling said in a
videotaped hookup with reporters in a nearby conference room. ``It
is another world, and a world apart from where you are. It is a
remarkable feat.''
   Her experiment will be the longest test so far of the airlock, a
human-inhabited module independent of the air, water and nutrients
of Earth.
   The experiment is the first major test of plans for the much
bigger Biosphere II, the largest closed ecosystem ever attempted.
Eight ``biospherians'' intend to enter that structure in 1990 for a
two-year stay.
   If the $30 million project succeeds, Space Biospheres Ventures
plans to sell versions to governments and researchers to preserve
endangered species or for research or space colonization, said
spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr.
   Ms. Alling's abbreviated module, stocked with flora and fauna, is
a steel-framed greenhouse with a 20-foot ceiling over a
23-by-23-foot base. Its 15,000 cubic feet would be about the size of
a two-story, two-room house.
   Biosphere II, by contrast, will have 5 million cubic feet under
glass, or about 2{ acres.
   Lack of room forced planners to omit chicken, fish and goats from
the test, and Ms. Alling will not be able to eat the full array of
fruits and vegetables of the larger experiment. But Ms. Dyhr said
she would take in 2,500 calories a day from 29 plant species,
including potatoes, beans, carrots, strawberries and papayas.
   Other members of the animal kingdom in the five-day test are
snails, insects and two fish.
   Air circulation works on a system similar to Biosphere II's: Hot
air will rise over the desert section of the module, pick up
moisture, then fall as rain. Solar fans and a turbine will send air
back over the desert to begin the cycle again. Plants will exchange
oxygen for the carbon dioxide given off by humans.
   Ms. Alling, a 29-year-old marine-mammal scientist with a master's
degree from Yale University, is a coordinator for Biosphere II. She
will monitor systems inside while project managers outside do the
same, as well as record Ms. Alling's heart and respiration rate and
other vital signs.
   Her living quarters will be kept private through use of blinds
will consist of an efficiency kitchen, bathroom with shower, bed and
a desk in a study area.
   Ms. Alling said she would be on a tight schedule each day, rising
at 7 a.m. to harvest and cook her food, then doing computer work on
Biosphere II, which will feature a 35-foot-deep ocean as one of its
seven separate environmental systems.
   She will be in touch with the outside through a telephone and
computer electronic mail, and the study has books and a
videocassette recorder.
   ``I'll even be able to watch Saturday night movies,'' Ms. Alling
said.
   She said that during preparation, she had learned to enjoy the
enclosed environment. ``It has the wonderful smell of a rich
tropical rain forest,'' Ms. Alling said.
   Eight ``biospherians'' are scheduled to enter Biosphere II in
1990 for a two-year stay.
   The aim of Biosphere II is to see if humans can exist in a
self-regulating world with its own climate. It has desert, ocean,
farmed land, marsh, savanna, jungle and human habitats in a
six-story building resembling a mosque.
   ``Basically it's an experiment to test the systems in terms of
maintaining the environment, the atmosphere particularly,'' said
Dyhr.
   There have been 2{ years of unmanned studies in the test module,
and there was a three-day manned study.

   Mayor-elect Peter Clavelle promised
Wednesday to continue pushing the agenda of retiring socialist Mayor
Bernard Sanders, though perhaps with a lower voice.
   Clavelle, the city's director of economic development, won
election Tuesday under the banner of Sanders' Progressive Coalition
party, defeating a Democratic rival by a 53-to-42 percent margin.
   ``I think what the people of Burlington have said yesterday is
that we've had Progressive government for the past eight years, and
it's been good government,'' Clavelle said at a news conference.
   While eschewing the socialist label that made Sanders something
of a celebrity, Clavelle said in an interview that he favors such
leftist goals as workplace democracy and a shift from military to
social spending.
   ``Those who have the money and those who have the power tend to
represent themselves pretty well,'' Clavelle said, adding that he
sees the job of mayor as being the one who ``tips the scales just a
little bit'' toward those without money and power.
   Clavelle showed surprising strength in traditionally Democratic
and Republican wards in his victory over Democrat Nancy Chioffi. He
received 5,626 votes to her 4,400 votes.
   Two minor party candidates split a few hundred other votes.
   Clavelle, 39, is the grandson of French-Canadians who came south
to work in the woolen mills of neighboring Winooski. He said he gets
his politics from his working-class background, not from Marxist
theory.
   His term begins April 1.
   Sanders, 47, who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986 and for
Congress last year, announced in December that he would leave
politics to teach and write. He doesn't rule out another try for
elective office.
   He was first elected mayor in 1981 and won three subsequent
two-year terms. He is the only avowed socialist mayor in the nation.

   Two British soldiers were killed
and six others injured when a guerrilla land mine exploded under
their jeeps Wednesday night in Londonderry, Northern Ireland's
second-largest city, police reported.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army, fighting British rule in Northern
Ireland.
   Sgt. John Brown, a police spokesman in Belfast, said the soldiers
were in a patrol traveling north out of the city in two armored Land
Rover jeeps shortly before midnight when a massive land mine
exploded.
   He said the second of the two jeeps took the main force of the
blast.
   Security forces sealed off the area after the blast.
   No other details were immediately available.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland
under socialist rule.
   Earlier Wednesday, the IRA issued a statement saying two elderly
men killed a day earlier in a triple murder at a gas station were
slain by mistake. It said the targets were three Protestants
allegedly questioned by police about recent attacks on Roman
Catholics.
   In London, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said the IRA plans a
bombing blitz in Britain using large quantities of explosives and
arms supplied by Libya.
   Hurd's warning followed discovery of an arms and explosives cache
at Scarborough, northeast England, that caused speculation the IRA
will try to kill Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher during a
Conservative Party conference there March 17-18.
   Party leaders confirmed Wednesday the meeting of the party's
national council would be held as planned at the Spa Conference
Center in Scarborough. Government sources said Mrs. Thatcher and
other Cabinet ministers were determined to defy the threat.
   An IRA bomb attack Oct. 12, 1984, at the annual Conservative
convention in the south coast resort of Brighton killed five people,
but Mrs. Thatcher was not hurt.
   While answering questions in the House of Commons, Hurd said:
``The Provisional IRA have a substantial amount of arms and
explosives which they got from Libya.
   ``These arms and explosives are concealed. They are being found
quite regularly in Ireland, north and south. Now they are being
found in London and north Yorkshire.''
   He said it was too early to tell if the arms were linked to an
IRA bomb factory police discovered Dec. 21 in Clapham, south London.
   Tom King, the Northern Ireland secretary, said: ``The intention
of the IRA is to kill, maim and murder wherever they find easy
targets and where carnage can be created.''
   He cited the latest discovery in proposing the annual renewal of
tough anti-terrorism measures for Northern Ireland. The vote to
renew was 239-118.
   In its statement about Tuesday's killings in Coagh village,
County Tyrone, the IRA said violin-maker Austin Nelson, 62, and
pensioner Ernie Rankin, 72, were shot down in the ``general
confusion.'' It said they had no paramilitary connections.
   The third man killed, station owner Leslie Dallas, was in the
Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed Protestant paramilitary group,
the IRA said.
   Two other men dived safely for cover. Police denied those men and
Dallas had been questioned about Protestant attacks, and said the
men named as the other two targets were not at the scene.

<HEAD>China Says VD Cases Quadrupling Every Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of venereal disease cases in China has
quadrupled annually in recent years because of increased
prostitution, sexual freedom and contacts with the outside world,
China's official news agency said Wednesday.
   Xinhua News Agency said the problem is particularly serious
because the sexually transmitted diseases were practically
non-existent in China for decades, and few doctors know how to
diagnose or treat them.
   The report did not give any nationwide figures, but it said
National Disease Prevention and Research Center statistics showed an
average 312 percent annual growth in VD cases in recent years. It
did not say how many years.
   It said Canton, China's most open city because of its proximity
to Hong Kong, recorded 10,000 VD cases between 1984 and September
last year.
   The semi-official China News Service said Wednesday that a
1-day-old boy in Canton recently was found to have been born with
gonorrhea contracted from his father. It said he was the ninth child
in the city confirmed to be suffering from VD.
   According to statistics from venereal disease centers in 16
cities, 70.5 percent of sufferers are male. About 77 percent are
gonorrhea cases, while 16.77 percent are syphilis.
   The return of VD was attributed to greater sexual freedom that
has broken barriers against premarital sex, more contacts with the
outside world and the ``rampancy of prostitution'' in some areas.
   Xinhua quoted the daily Health News as saying some women are
becoming prostitutes simply to make money, while others are forced
into prostitution by gangs and some are frustrated in love and
ignorant about sex.
   Before the Communist takeover in 1949, an estimated 10 million
people in in China had VD, 500,000 in Shanghai alone.
   But the Communist government eradicated prostitution in the early
1950s, and in the early 1960s it claimed that VD no longer existed
in China.
   Health News said that because China was VD-free for so long,
chapters on the diseases were left out off medical books and doctors
are not able to recognize or treat them. Fake medicine dealers and
charlatans are exploiting some people afraid to go to hospitals with
their problems, it said.
   In the past few years, China has set up 192 treatment and
prevention agencies throughout the country and established a
national center in Nanking.

   A 4-year-old boy playing with a heater
accidentally set a fire Wednesday that engulfed a wood frame house
and triggered an explosion that killed one firefighter and
critically burned two others, officials said.
   Authorities said the ``flash over'' _ a detonation of gases
produced by combustion _ pushed the temperature in the house to over
1,000 degrees, melting the clothes and protective gear off the three
firefighters.
   Firefighter Jeffrey N. Lindsey, 23, a four-year veteran whose
brother helped fight the same fire, was the first Oklahoma City
firefighter to die while fighting a fire since 1950, Fire Chief Tom
Smith said.
   Bennie D. Zellner, 44, and Jimmy L. Ayers, 46, were hospitalized
in critical condition with second- and third-degree burns covering
70 percent to 90 percent of their bodies, officials said. Two other
firefighters sustained minor injuries.
   ``The heat was so bad it disintegrated everything they were
wearing,'' said Dr. Peter Silverstein of the Baptist Medical Center
burn center, who estimated their exposure at 1,000 degrees. Smith
said the temperature was probably even higher.
   ``These guys are young, healthy men, and we expect that their
vital organs will give us a good fight and keep going,'' Silverstein
said. ``Physiologically they stand the best chances of anybody of
surviving.''
   The fire in a frame house in southwest Oklahoma City was started
in a closet by a child who was playing with wood in an open-faced
heater, fire officials said.
   Smith said the child's mother tried to put the fire out with
water before going to neighbors' homes to call the fire department.
   The fire chief said the three firefighters were wearing full
protective gear, but that the explosive intensity of the fire was
too hot for it to prevent the burns.
   ``There is nothing on the market that would have protected them
under those conditions,'' he said.
   Officials said American and state flags at all the fire stations
were lowered to half-staff Wednesday in honor of Lindsey.
   Smith said funeral services have not been scheduled for Lindsey,
who is survived by his wife Melissa Lindsey, who is expecting their
first child.

   Declaring that she must ``do everything
right from here on in,'' Susan Butcher prepared to leave here late
Wednesday afternoon in her quest for a fourth consecutive victory in
the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
   Butcher reached McGrath, 407 miles into the race, at 8:17 a.m.
Wednesday, about 15{ hours after Joe Runyan of Nenana became the
first musher to arrive in the Kuskokwim River community.
   Butcher was followed by four-time Iditarod winner Rick Swenson in
the No.3 position at 10:05 a.m. Dee Dee Jonrowe and Martin Buser
completed the top five, arriving in McGrath at 10:11 a.m. and 11:03
a.m., respectively. Another 10 mushers in the field of 45 pulled
into McGrath by late afternoon.
   Runyan said he would stay in the village for the 24-hour layover
required in the course of the 1,168-mile race from Anchorage to
Nome. Completing the layover meant Runyan was unable to leave
McGrath before 4:43 p.m. Wednesday.
   Twelve of the mushers still in the race Wednesday had not taken
their layovers. Many, including Butcher, completed them at Rohn.
   Butcher said the number of teams leading among the 45 still in
the race hadn't thinned as much as she expected. She also said she
believed the frantic pace Runyan set had sapped his dogs.
   ``It took him 15 hours to cross the (Farewell) Burn,'' she said.
``It took me only 10.''
   Forty-nine mushers left the Iditarod starting line Saturday in
Anchorage. Three dropped out relatively early in the race and a
fourth, David Aisenbrey, added his name to the scratch list
Wednesday. Officials at the Iditarod headquarters in Anchorage said
they did not know the reason for Aisenbrey's withdrawal.
   The annual Iditarod began 17 years ago and was inspired by a 1925
relay of serum to Nome during a diphtheria outbreak. The race, which
carries a $250,000 purse, is put on largely by volunteers.
   Gov. Steve Cowper has been among them, but he said Wednesday that
he no longer has the time to offer his services. Nonetheless, he
made it to Nikolai, the checkpoint before McGrath, to see some of
the activity.
   ``A lot of the mushers are pretty good friends of mine from way
back,'' Cowper said. ``I love this race and I'd do anything I can to
promote it.''
   The governor said musher and Iditarod founder Joe Redington, No.
14 in the rankings Wednesday afternoon, has offered to provide him
with a dog team if he wants to compete some year.
   ``That may be a little ways down the trail, as they say,'' said
Cowper, who is serving his first term. ``It probably won't work
until I leave my present employment.''

   Police reported on Tuesday the discovery of an arms
and explosives cache near the northeast seaside resort of
Scarborough, where Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is to address a
political gathering next week.
   The newspaper The Independent said in its Wednesday issue, early
copies of which were available Tuesday night, that police believe
the discovery may have foiled a new attempt by the Irish Republican
Army to kill Mrs. Thatcher.
   The Times of London described the find as ``a substantial IRA
terrorist cache.'' It said the discovery highlighted police fears
that the IRA had re-established on the British mainland with plans
for an extensive campaign.
   Mrs. Thatcher survived an IRA bombing on Oct. 12, 1984 in which
five people died at the Conservative Party's annual convention at
the south coast resort of Brighton. The blast partly demolished the
hotel in which Mrs. Thatcher, many of her Cabinet members and many
prominent Conservatives were staying.
   North Yorkshire police said guns, ammunition, 25 pounds of Semtex
explosive and other bomb-making materials were found on Monday
buried in woodland near a road by a man gathering leaf mold for his
garden.
   Deputy Chief Constable Frank Morritt said he could not discount a
link between the find near Scalby village, two miles outside
Scarborough, and Mrs. Thatcher's visit to Scarborough for the March
17-18 national council conference of her governing Conservative
Party.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland. It wants to unite the Protestant-led province with
the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   Security forces dragged Tibetans from their
houses Wednesday as thousands of Chinese troops took up posts around
Lhasa after three days of anti-Chinese riots, travelers said.
   By official count, 12 people had been killed and more than 100
wounded in violence since Sunday when Tibetans marched in Lhasa,
demanding an end to nearly four decades of communist rule and the
return of their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Travelers quoted
Tibetans as saying the actual death toll was much higher.
   The Dalai Lama's government-in-exile in India offered to hold
talks with China to discuss the future of Tibet. The Chinese Embassy
in New Delhi refused comment.
   China on Thursday accused Tibetan separatists living abroad of
smuggling weapons into Tibet and instigating riots in Lhasa, the
Tibetan capital. In a commentary, the official Xinhua News Agency
also defended China's human rights record in Tibet, saying it is
those opposed to Chinese rule who trample on the rights of the
Tibetan people.
   Foreign witnesses to this week's rioting said they saw no
Tibetans with weapons.
   China also announced further martial law orders: all foreigners
must report to police; Tibetans harboring criminals must turn them
in, and People's Armed Police will continue to suppress and root out
separatists.
   No reports surfaced of further demonstrations or gunfire on
Wednesday and early Thursday, but Westerners in Lhasa said troops
filled the streets.
   Beginning at midnight Tuesday, trucks with loudspeakers drove
through the city of 70,000 announcing martial law was in effect and
ordering Tibetans to stay inside, said foreign travelers, most of
whom spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The foreigners gave the following account:
   Dozens of trucks packed with soldiers entered the city and troops
_ some drinking beer _ set up checkpoints 15 miles outside Lhasa and
at nearly every block in the city. Soldiers stopped all but official
vehicles and arrested Tibetans in the streets.
   ``They were just collaring people ... and stuffing them into
jeeps,'' said an American.
   Tibetans screamed with fright as Chinese troops pulled them from
their homes.
   ``These were women's voices,'' said an Australian. ``The truck
kept coming back. They would pick up a couple people, drive off with
a half-dozen militia holding them down, then come back.''
   It was not known who the people were, why they were picked up or
how widespread the roundups were because the foreigners were
confined to their hotels. But foreigners contacted at several hotels
said they saw police raiding the homes of ordinary Tibetans along
the streets in front of their hotels.
   Mobs led by Tibetan youths ransacked Chinese shops in three days
of rioting through Tuesday, and a European traveler said not one
Chinese-owned shop in the old quarter of the city escaped damage.
   The estimated 150 foreigners in Lhasa have been ordered to leave
the city by noon Thursday, but they were forbidden Wednesday to
leave their hotels to buy tickets.
   Tourists said they were given a choice of going to Nepal by bus,
going to other cities in Tibet or flying to Chengdu.
   One traveler said soldiers stopped her and five others from
catching a chartered bus for Nepal. Officials later told her they
had arranged another bus to the border but wanted $4,185, three
times the previous price, she said.
   ``They can shoot people and arrest people, but getting you a
ticket and helping you change money is beyond their capacity,'' said
one American.
   The travelers spoke in telephone interviews from Lhasa to
Chengdu, the capital of neighboring Sichuan province and one of the
few points of entry to the remote Himalayan region.
   Police detained two British reporters overnight. Jasper Becker of
the Guardian newspaper said he and a reporter for the Reuters news
agency were released Wednesday after being questioned, with
authorities most concerned about photographs.
   One Swiss who refused to turn over his film Sunday said police
beat him and pointed a gun at his head. He said the police still had
his camera and passport and wouldn't return them until he hands over
the film and pays a fine. He said he was not injured.
   Three Swedes and an American who also took pictures were given
back their cameras and passports after they paid fines.
   The imposition of martial law marked the first time Chinese
authorities had taken the step anywhere since the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution.
   Authorities apparently took the measure to prevent demonstrations
on Friday, anniversary of the failed uprising that led the Dalai
Lama to flee to India in 1959.
   The violence that began Sunday was the fourth clash in 18 months
between Chinese security forces and Tibetans. Troops were not
deployed in the previous episodes, in which at least 40 Tibetans and
police were killed.
   China claims Tibet has been part of China since the 13th century.
But many Tibetans maintain the territory was an independent nation
before the communists took over in 1949.
   In New Delhi, the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile said it was
ready to work for a peaceful solution to the unrest.

   The organizers of a college basketball
tournament stand to lose up to $50,000 this week because a measles
outbreak has forced them to hold the games in an empty 15,000-seat
arena.
   Officials at the host University of Hartford have juggled
schedules, canceled events and asked fans to donate the cost of
their unused tickets. But despite their efforts, the event's winners
_ who must bear the greatest share of the loss _ could be financial
losers.
   ``If I was to put ink to paper right now, I'd estimate those
losses are going to be $30,000 to $50,000,'' University of Hartford
Athletic Director Don Cook said Wednesday.
   The tournament, to pick the winner of the East Coast Athletic
Conference's North Atlantic Conference, is scheduled to start
Thursday and end Sunday.
   A Hartford basketball player's case of measles and an outbreak of
the highly contagious disease on the campus of Siena College,
another NAC member, prompted the spectator ban.
   Hartford, as host, is fronting the money for the tournament. Any
losses will be reimbursed from proceeds the winning team receives
from the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The winner
receives an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament worth just more
than $250,000 this year, Cook said.
   The first priority in distributing the $250,000 is
administrative. The winning team gets 50 percent of the balance, and
the remaining 50 percent is shared by the other nine member schools.
   Cook said organizers would have a better estimate of losses once
they know how many of Hartford's 2,000 season ticket-holders ask for
refunds on their $18 tournament tickets.
   ``We've had people who have donated their tickets or their
money,'' he said. ``We've had others that ask for refunds.''
   Meanwhile, tournament organizers have done their best to see that
no one else gets the measles.
   Players will be met by a tournament delegate at their hotel and
led through a service entrance into the Civic Center, where the
games will be played, Cook said.
   Reporters covering the tournament will be asked to prove they've
been immunized against the disease; if not, they'll receive
vaccinations on the spot.
   For fans, it will be a bleak three days, with just one bit of
consolation: Saturday's championship game will be televised on ESPN.

<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou on Wednesday
denied any involvement in a financial scandal rocking the country
and called it an international conspiracy to topple his Socialist
government.
   In a 15-minute televised address to the nation, Papandreou also
said he will sue the U.S. news magazine Time for defamation, both in
Greece and abroad, over an interview it carried with the fugitive
banker George Koskotas.
   ``I felt the need to communicate with you because for the first
time in my political life my character is being doubted. ... I want
to make clear that not a trace of the mud that is flying from all
quarters involves me,'' the 70-year-old leader said.
   In the magazine report, Koskotas, the former chairman of the
privately-owned Bank of Crete, accused Papandreou and other senior
Socialist leaders of demanding and receiving millions of dollars in
payoffs from his bank.
   The 34-year-old banker, who rose to fame creating a publishing
empire in just four years, fled the country in November after being
indicted in the $200 million fraud, forgery and embezzlement scandal.
   Time ran the story in its March 13 issue following a series of
six interviews with the financier in a Boston prison, where he is
awaiting an extradition hearing scheduled for March 16.
   ``Time is a magazine of the American establishment. ... Now we
can see clearly which forces are hiding behind the attempts to
uproot democracy in our country,'' Papandreou said in the address.
   Papandreou added that the attempts to overthrow his government
will continue up until the June 1989 general elections.
   The Koskotas affair has spurred both the Conservative and
Communist opposition parties to call for the leader's immediate
resignation.
   The government has also come under increasing attack from members
of the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) for its
handling of the scandal. In the five months since the scandal first
emerged it has triggered the resignations of seven Cabinet members.
   Although the government has maintained from the start that the
allegations were part of a domestic and foreign-inspired plot to
usurp Papandreou from power, it has avoided naming the forces behind
it.
   Recent opinion polls have indicated that Papandreou's popularity
has declined sharply in the past six months because of his highly
public extramarital liasion with a former air hostess.
   The premier, who underwent open heart surgery in London last
fall, made the address from his suburban home in Kastri. He has been
living with his 34-year-old girlfriend in a nearby villa since his
return from the British capital.
   Papandreou's televised address was delayed when journalists went
on a three-hour strike. The walkout was called by the Union of
Athens Journalists at the two state-run television channels to
protest the government's alleged monopoly of the medium and the
behavior of state officials toward the news media.

<HEAD>Vandals Mistake MIA `Rescue' Group for Anti-Abortion `Rescue' Organization</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vandals targeting an anti-abortion
group also have been hitting an organization with a similar name
that is dedicated to gathering information on servicemen missing in
Southeast Asia.
   The office of Operation Rescue Inc., the missing-in-action group,
and the office of Operation Rescue of Southern California, the
anti-abortion group, were vandalized late Sunday night or early
Monday.
   The vandals left wire coat hangers, silhouettes of people in red
spray paint and leaflets stating ``Operation Rescue Operation
Death.''
   ``They think we're this other group,'' said Krista Eppley,
spokeswoman for the MIA group, Operation Rescue Inc., which was
founded in 1983. She said there have been other misdirected
hostilities over the last two months.
   ``The phone messages have been all fairly radical, real ugly and
threatening,'' she said Monday.
   Police Lt. Stuart Finkelstein said the vandals have not been
identified, and said the damage was under investigation as malicious
mischief.
   Operation Rescue of Southern California, part of a national group
that demonstrates at clinics where abortions are performed, opened
an office here in January.
   Ms. Eppley said she's asked the anti-abortion group to change its
name.
   ``We've been around for a long time; it's not like we're some new
kid on the block,'' she said. ``I don't want to have to worry about
some weirdo shooting at me.''
   Kenneth Tanner, the anti-abortion group's director, apologized
for the other group's distress but said the name would not be
changed.
   He said the telephone company has been asked to clarify the
directory listing and that the group is also planning to move to
another city.
   ``We sympathize with them and feel really bad,'' he said.
``Hopefully, whoever is responsible for this will realize what a
foolish mistake they made.''

   Harry Andrews, a craggy, jut-jawed character actor
who specialized in military roles, died Monday at age 77.
   Andrews made his stage debut at age 21 and had many Shakespearean
roles, including Horatio in ``Hamlet'' in New York in 1936. He made
his first movie in 1952, opposite Alan Ladd in ``The Red Beret.''
   Andrews' is most remembered as the tough warden of a British army
prison who played opposite Sean Connery in the 1965 film ``The

he also showed a comic flair as the campy older man in 1970's
``Entertaining Mr. Sloane.''

   Four more Democratic senators turned down the
White House on Wednesday and declared their opposition to John Tower
to be defense secretary, but Republican leader Bob Dole tried to
stave off defeat by proposing an extraordinary six-month trial
confirmation.
   Dole said the trial period would let senators judge whether Tower
lived up to his no-drinking pledge. Senate Democratic Leader George
Mitchell expressed ``immediate serious concerns'' over the proposal,
but promised to consider it overnight.
   Dole made his dramatic bid to salvage the nomination at the end
of the fifth day of a draining Senate debate, and it followed the
decision by four more Democrats to vote against Tower, giving
opponents of Tower a majority.
   Dole conceded it would ``take a miracle to win confirmation.''
   Under Dole's proposal, Tower would be confirmed, but would submit
a letter of resignation to President Bush dated Oct. 1, 1989. If
Tower's performance were satisfactory, there ``probably'' would be
no need to reconfirm him, Dole said. Otherwise, ``he probably
wouldn't be the nominee.''
   Dole said he offered his proposal after discussing it with Tower.
It came as the Senate neared a climax in its bitter struggle over
the nomination.
   Lloyd Bentsen of Texas became the third Democrat to endorse
Tower's confirmation, but his speech was bracketed by declarations
of opposition from Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Bennett Johnston
of Louisiana, Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Charles Robb of
Virginia _ Democrats who had been lobbied hard by the Bush
administration as potential pro-Tower votes.
   An Associated Press survey found 51 Democrats and Republican Sen.
Larry Pressler of South Dakota either solidly opposed or leaning
against confirmation with 41 Republicans and three Democrats either
supporting or leaning in favor of the nomination.
   Democrats hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate.
   Dole made his extraordinary proposal to deal with Senate concerns
over Tower's history of drinking. ``I think we ought to give him a
second chance that many of us have had,'' said Dole, who was
seriously wounded during World War II but has risen to a position of
power and prominence in the Senate.
   ``It gives this Senate a second opportunity. It addresses the
concerns raised by the chairman and the majority leader and by
others at the same time it gives President Bush his choice for
secretary of defense,'' Dole said.
   Earlier, Dole suggested Tower be permitted to come to the Senate
and answer the allegations against him, but did not immediately
press the issue when Mitchell objected.
   There was little doubt that Dole's maneuverings were his final
bid to save the nomination. Earlier, he conceded it would ``take a
miracle'' to do so, and Johnston's speech seemed to deflate
Republican hopes.
   ``In the nuclear age we can't afford to take a chance on the man
who holds the future in his hands,'' Johnston said on the Senate
floor.
   The Louisiana Democrat said he was troubled by Tower's drinking
habits and noted that alcohol altered the former senator's judgment.
``There seems to be a personality change that occurs in Senator
Tower,'' Johnston said.
   Earlier, Bentsen became the third Democrat to support the
embattled nomination, saying, ``I hope that when I get the next
chance to talk with John Tower about the tough job of keeping this
country strong, it will be while he's in his new office at the
Pentagon.''
   ``I'm both honored to have his prestigious support, and grateful
for his humane understanding of what my family has endured,'' Tower
said.
   Despite Bentsen's decision, Mitchell repeated his claim the
Senate will reject the nomination, and he led a chorus of Democrats
who called for a quick vote.
   Mitchell said he was ready to vote ``as soon as possible. A
reasonable time would be tomorrow.''
   Tower, who served in the Senate from 1961 to 1984, has been
dogged by allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing as well
as questions about his lucrative defense consulting contracts since
retirement from government service.
   Bentsen's decision to support the nominee was high drama.
   The former vice presidential candidate praised the work of fellow
Democrats who have opposed the nomination _ Mitchell and Sam Nunn,
the Georgia senator who chairs the Armed Services Committee, but
said he would support the a man with whom he served in the Senate
for 14 years.
   Bentsen noted that in January he had introduced Tower to the
Senate Armed Services Committee and said he was qualified to be
defense secretary. Since then, he said, he has read the FBI report
and heard the accusations against Tower.
   ``I found most of the allegations about John Tower's personal
life without enough basis to deny a president his choice,'' said
Bentsen, the influential Senate Finance Committee chairman who had
been courted by the White House after the nomination ran aground.
   Bentsen conceded that the nomination process, which has been so
difficult for Tower, has been equally painful for himself.
   ``In the passion of debate, pundits writing in the isolation of
their own offices, can forget that public figures have feelings,''
Bentsen said. ``We have seen every imperfection in an essentially
good man dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights while
his daughters sat listening.''
   After Bentsen made his announcement, Nunn, who has led the fight
against Tower's confirmation, walked over and shook his hand.
   Watching the Senate proceedings were Tower's daughters, Jeanne
Tower Cox and Marian Tower. Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., ushered the
two women outside the Senate gallery and Bentsen greeted each of
them with a hug.

   President Bush is trying to dispel an
impression that ``nothing is happening'' in his young
administration, saying it hasn't been stalled by his struggle to win
confirmation of John Tower as defense secretary.
   Bush on Tuesday responded to news reports that his administration
is adrift by recounting actions he has taken such as developing a
savings and loan rescue plan, meeting with foreign leaders and
presenting a budget package to Congress.
   ``My response is it's not adrift and there isn't malaise,'' he
said. ``I would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be
bubbling around, that nothing is happening. A lot is happening. Not
all of it good, but a lot is happening.''
   Bush, in an impromptu news conference, also reiterated his
opposition to White House intervention in the Eastern Airlines
strike. He said pilots threatening a slowdown to support the
striking machinists should not ``make the innocent traveling public

   The Justice Department's antitrust chief is
promising tougher enforcement of laws to preserve competition in the

   Assistant Attorney General Charles F. Rule said in a speech
Tuesday that the antitrust division would take a harder look at
mergers than did the Transportation Department, which gave up its
authority to review airline deals at the end of 1988.
   ``Perhaps somewhat overlooked by DOT in the course of
deregulating the airline industry, the antitrust laws have a
valuable role to play to ensure that a competitive environment does
not sow the seeds of its own demise,'' Rule told the International
Aviation Club.
   ``The antitrust division intends to use its new-found authority _
as well as pre-existing authority _ to apply those laws with
appropriate care in order to ensure that U.S. airline markets remain
competitive in the years to come,'' Rule said.

   ``Home, Sweet Home'' is a cruel illusion for
millions of women not just in the United States but also in
countries around the globe, according to an analysis of violence
against women worldwide.
   ``If a person is murdered because of his or her politics, the
world justifiably responds with outrage. But if a person is beaten
or allowed to die because she is female, the world dismisses it as
`cultural tradition,''' says the report from the Worldwatch
Institute in Washington.
   Africa and the Indian subcontinent are identified as particular
problem areas by the report, which was written by Lori Heise, a
senior researcher with the institute. But no society or
socioeconomic group has been spared the problem, she says.
   Before the sun goes down today _ International Women's Day _
thousands of women worldwide will have been beaten in their homes by
their partners and thousands more will have been raped, assaulted
and sexually harassed, according to Heise's figures.

   On a television sitcom, the permanent sets
must be more than a place for the characters to hang out.
   ``Any designer can design a standing set,'' said Roy Christopher,
a four-time Emmy-winning production designer.
   ``But to do that and reinforce the vision of the writer and tell
the audience about the character is absolutely necessary. Anything
else is decor.''
   The CBS show ``Murphy Brown'' required three permanent sets, the
television office and studio where Murphy (Candice Bergen) and the
others do ``FYI,'' the Washington bar where they meet after work,
and Murphy's townhouse in Georgetown.
   He said the job of the production designer is to ``design
everything you see on the screen except people.'' The designer also
coordinates the wardrobe, special effects, props and set decoration.
   Christopher obtained pictures and background material from the
research library at Warner Television, where the show is made.
   ``I looked at the pictures of television offices but I wanted
more glamor,'' he said. ``I finally found what I needed in pictures
of the offices of the newspaper USA Today. I wanted a high-tech
slickness.
   ``Candice Bergen called me to say hello. She said, `Please don't
put any orange carpet on the set.'''
   Her townhouse seems to be in a permanent state of re-decoration.
Eldin, the painter, has become a fixture on the show.
   ``Colleen Dewhurst liked the show and asked to be on,'' said
Christopher. ``They wrote a part for her as Murphy's mother. She
said she had only one request. We thought, `Oh, no, here comes the
request for Jack Warner's old office as her dressing room.' But what
she wanted was a scene with Eldin the painter.''
   Two Christopher-designed shows are coming up. On Friday, PBS will
present ``In the Mood: The Glenn Miller Band Reunion.'' On Sunday,
CBS will telecast ``The People's Choice Awards.''
   ``I wanted a 1940s big band look for the Glenn Miller show,'' he
said. ``It's almost art deco black and white. I put in two balconies
over the stage for people to sit. That harks back to the days of the
Macambo night club.
   ``In an awards show, you go for glamor and short entrances for
the winners and presenters. The first awards show I designed it took
15 seconds for the entrances. With entrances like that a show could
take 16 hours. So, you go for short entrances and good backgrounds.
Half of my job is glamorizing show business.''
   Christopher has designed five Academy Award shows, five Emmy
shows, three Grammy shows and four TV Academy Hall of Fame telecasts.
   He recently designed the upcoming ABC series ``The Robert
Guillaume Show'' and ``Ghost Writer,'' a pilot for Anthony Perkins.
He is currently working on another pilot about a fashion model
called ``The High Life.''
   ``I like to do sets like `Chico and the Man,' which was an old
garage. Or I like to do those that are lush and expensive,'' he said.
   When he designed ``Our Town'' it presented a challenge because
it's done on a bare stage.
   ``I painted the whole stage like a Grant Wood painting,'' he
said. ``Then I suspended scrims to represent roof tops. From up high
it gives the illusion of being a town. But when you get down to
ground level you see it's a bare stage.''
   Christopher, who lives in a loft in downtown Los Angeles that he
and his wife, Dorothy, a set decorator, designed, works for
television and the stage, but stays away from feature films.
   ``Most of them are done on location,'' he said. ``I like to sit
down and design stuff. I like to create an illusion of reality.
Feature films just re-create reality.''

<HEAD>PBS Viewers Can Catch Oscar-Nominated Olmos Performance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public television viewers can get a look at
Edward James Olmos' Oscar-nominated performance in ``Stand and
Deliver'' this week on PBS' ``American Playhouse'' series.
   Olmos, who won an Emmy for best supporting actor playing taciturn
Lt. Martin Castillo on NBC's ``Miami Vice,'' is up for an Academy
Award this year as Best Actor for his brilliant performance as
tough, playful, real-life mathematics teacher Jaime Escalante, whose
offbeat style of teaching inspired his disadvantaged East Los
Angeles students to go on to higher education.
   The film also stars Lou Diamond Phillips (``La Bamba'') as one of
the students. It airs Wednesday on ``American Playhouse'' on PBS.
   Olmos has displayed his acting range before in an ``American
Playhouse'' film, ``The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez.'' He played the
title character, a quiet, law-abiding south Texas horseman who has
to flee an unjust accusation of murder after a fatal
misunderstanding over a simple Spanish word.
   In ``Stand and Deliver,'' Olmos goes in the opposite direction as
the charismatic Escalante, who badgerd and cajoled even barrio gang
members to sign a ``contract'' promising to spend 30 hours a week on
homework, stay after school and take extra classes in the summer.
   Olmos even submitted to treatments to make his hair thin so he
would resemble the balding Escalante.
   The Bolivian-born Escalante gave up a successful career in
electronics to teach high school. He was supposed to teach
computers, but when he arrived at the school, there were no
computers. There were, however, students, and Escalante began to
teach them calculus.
   The movie centers on the students in Escalante's 1982 class, 18
of whom took an advanced placement test in calculus. They did
remarkably well. But the testing service became suspicious when
their wrong answers were too similar, and they were accused of
cheating and disqualified. Escalante believed the students' scores
would never have been challenged had they not had Hispanic surnames.
   The film does suggest in one subtle scene that a glitch in
Escalante's teaching methods might have been the reason the students
all made the same minor mistakes.
   Phillips plays one of the toughs in Escalante's class. He is
smart enough to understand what Escalante is offering him _ a way
out of poverty. But he has to save face with his gang, so he asks
for an extra book. See, he can't be seen carrying schoolbooks
around, so he'll keep one at home and one at school.
   Some of the other students are played by Virginia Paris, Mark
Eliot, Ingrid Oliu, Karla Montana, Richard Martinez and Mark Everett.
   The film was co-written by Ramon Menendez (``Borderline'') and
Tom Musca (``Nikita''). Menendez directed.
   ``Stand and Deliver'' is an example of a financing arrangement
through which PBS helps pay production costs in exchange for
television rights. The deal has resulted in some of the most
talked-about independent films in recent years, including
``Testament'' in 1983, ``El Norte'' in 1984, ``Smooth Talk'' in
1985, and last year's critically acclaimed documentary ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' which recently led to the overturning of a murder
conviction. It will appear on ``American Playhouse'' next season.

   CALL HIM `RICK' _ Ricky Schroder, whose character Newt became a

according to a CBS release on Schroder's new TV movie. The child

   WRITING CREDITS _ Independent filmmaker John Sayles has penned a

tossed out of his big, fancy law firm. Sayles wrote last year's
critically acclaimed ``Eight Men Out.'' His other movies include
``Matewan,'' ``Brother From Another Planet'' and ``The Return of the
Secaucus Seven.'' ... Joan Tewkesbury, perhaps best-known for
writing director Robert Altman's critically acclaimed film
``Nashville,'' has been signed to turn the Olive Ann Burns'
best-selling novel ``Cold Sassy Tree'' into a film for the TNT
network. Production is scheduled to begin this spring. Faye Dunaway

   That commission hunting for a politically
blameless way to deal with budget deficits had to give up the search
_ but it did leave some advice on better ways for the government to
make spending decisions.
   That's something Congress has been seeking since it went into
business, 200 years ago. In a way, the process almost came full
circle.
   The first Congress passed a single appropriations bill and
entrusted specific spending decisions to the White House. After all,
if you couldn't trust George Washington. ...
   By the 1980s, the appropriations process had become so cumbersome
and contentious that Congress twice despaired of passing individual
money bills and piled everything into a single mammoth resolution,
full of detailed orders and restrictions.
   President Reagan signed under protest, accepting items he opposed
in order to get others he wanted, and to keep the government going.
He'd vetoed one catchall appropriations resolution during his first
term, producing a temporary government shutdown rather than accept
spending he said would bust his austerity budget.
   President Bush says he will not accept a single, catchall money
measure. ``I am going to refuse to sign another omnibus spending
bill,'' he said as a candidate. That may be put to the test.
   Congress managed to pass all its money bills on time during the
last budget year because of an agreement reached under the pressure
of the 1987 stock market crash. With no crisis to enforce
discipline, that performance will be difficult to match.
   While it expired without a bipartisan consensus on deficit
reduction measures, the National Economic Commission did agree that
any plan to cut deficits will have to include changes in the way
government spending decisions are made.
   ``The balance of power on budget issues has swung too far from
the executive and toward the legislative branch,'' the commission's
Republican majority said.
   The panel's Democrats didn't go quite that far. After all, these
days legislative equals Democrats and executive equals Republicans.
Historically, though, the issue has involved the powers of two
branches of government rather than competition between the two
parties.
   The commission's 14 members were unanimous on one specific change
in the system, suggesting that the government move to two-year
budgets instead of enacting a new one each year.
   They also agreed that budget goals should be drawn more clearly
and enforced more stringently.
   The modern budgeting process dates from 1921, when Congress began
requiring presidents to submit detailed annual budgets. That put the
executive branch in charge, and Congress has been whittling at its
authority ever since. The current congressional budget system was
installed in the name of reform in 1974, setting a series of
legislative timetables Congress seldom manages to meet.
   That law limited the power of presidents to withhold money
Congress appropriates, a device that had been used by presidents of
both parties, but one that became most bitterly disputed when
Richard M. Nixon used it to block increases in more than 100
domestic programs. Presidents have been trying to get around that
barrier ever since.
   Under the law, a president cannot withhold appropriated funds
unless he advises Congress and gets its permission within 45 days.
``At the very least,'' Bush said in his first budget message, ``when
a president proposes to rescind federal spending, the Congress
should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by
inaction.''
   Bush also seeks the line item veto, authority for a president to
knock a single spending item out of an appropriations bill without
rejecting the whole bill. That won't happen easily, if at all,
because it would undo one of the ways Congress can force a president
to accept what it wants done. When an entire appropriation is
hostage to an unwanted provision, presidents often sign rather than
fight.
   Reagan had sought the same thing, and the economic commission
majority said presidents should have authority either to veto line
items or to rescind appropriations once they have become law.
   Commission Republicans advocated a constitutional amendment to
require a balanced budget and, in a bow to Bush's no-new-taxes
pledge, said it should include a ceiling on revenues that can be
collected.
   They also recommended what would amount to a permanent system of
appropriations, proposing that Congress set up spending resolutions
that would continue automatically at the previous year's dollar
levels, with no increase for inflation.
   Congress is a lot better at setting deadlines than at meeting
them, so that might be the most significant change of all were it to
happen. It won't.

<TEXT>
   The coffee shop on Bleecker Street where Ed
O'Neill had wanted to meet was jam-packed with soggy tourists
seeking refuge from the sudden downpour.
   O'Neill pushed his way through the crowd and suggested a quick
sprint to his apartment a block away. Inside the fourth-floor
walkup, O'Neill checked the refrigerator for vittles and extracted
white bread, mayonnaise and cold turkey, which he graciously offered
his guest _ no thanks _ who was busy removing drying sweatsocks from
the back of the vinyl dining-room chair.
   While slathering mayo on bread, O'Neill considered comparisons of
the show on which he stars, Fox's ``Married ... With Children,'' and
ABC's new sitcom, ``Roseanne.'' Both are centered on
lower-middle-class families with kids.
   O'Neill plays Al Bundy, a hapless shoe salesman with a primping,
stay-at-home wife (Katey Sagal) and two borderline
juvenile-delinquent kids (Christina Applegate and David Faustino).
   On ``Roseanne,'' plump protagonists Roseanne Barr and John
Goodman struggle valiantly, if sardonically, against the financial
realities of the blue-collar '80s, surrounded by a halo of family
love.
   ``I like the idea that they (`Roseanne') have people who aren't
typically real good-looking, you know, television-type people,
character people, and that's nice, I think. I think that's part of
the appeal of it, it's just kinda like folks,'' said O'Neill who
grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, the son of a truck driver.
   On ``Married ... With Children,'' it's a little more work to find
any evidence of familial love. It is suggested to O'Neill that the
humor on his show is, well, kind of mean.
   ``The thing I like about our show is that we are mean-spirited a
lot of times,'' he said. ``We don't even try to hide it or make
excuses for it.''
   No kidding. A couple of major sponsors recently pulled
advertising from ``Married ... With Children'' because of a letter
campaign by a Detroit housewife who said she found the show
anti-family. Fox says it has a waiting list for commercial spots
nevertheless.
   In a recent episode, the Bundys gleefully hied to a fancy
restaurant to blow the pittance a deceased relative had left them.
When the bill came, Al realized he had left his wallet at home. The
kids, sent to fetch the money, were faced with a moral dilemma _
return to bail out the folks, or purchase tickets to that night's
Tears and Vomit concert. The kids split with the cash.
   Such no-holds-barred slaps at typical sitcom family life have
found an audience for Fox. ``Married ... With Children'' is pulling
a network-quality share of the Sunday audience and has become a
force to be reckoned with by the big guys at ABC, CBS and NBC.
   O'Neill, a serious New York stage actor who had found some
success guesting on network shows and starring in a couple of
pilots, heard about the new Fox network on a trip to Los Angeles.
   ``I read it, and I was laughing,'' he recalled. ``And I went in
and read for them (executive producers Ron Leavitt and Michael
Moye), and they were such funny guys. They were such off-the-wall
characters, I immediately thought, `I like this.' ... I had, like,
this connection to the character.''
   Back in New York, his agent advised to pass on the sitcom, since
he was ``hot'' at NBC, having starred in the made-for-TV movie
``Popeye Doyle.''
   ``So I said, `OK, pass.' So about 20 minutes later, I'm just
sitting here, thinking, `I like that.' So I called L.A. I said, `All
right, if they'll give me $4,000 more a week, tell 'em they have a
deal and I'll be there in the morning.'''
   Now O'Neill has become something of a latter-day Ralph Kramden.
Fans, who know him as ``Al,'' stop him on the street.
   ``Somehow they identify with the guy. They relate to him some
way. And I know I did when I read the pilot. It just reminded me of
a couple of my uncles. It's a self-deprecating humor. People that
don't have a lot going for them, the ones that always interest me
the most are the ones who can laugh at their situation a lot as sort
of a way through it, and I saw that in the character.''

<HEAD>Tissue from Aborted Fetuses at Center of Scientific, Ethical Debate</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of aborted fetuses is redefining the ground rules of
medical research, pitting scientists who hope to alleviate suffering
against ethicists who fear the specter of Nazi-style experimentation
on unwilling subjects.
   Critics of fetal tissue research envision abortion-for-profit
from tissue sales and foresee organ ``parts shops'' in hospitals.
Proponents counter that researchers are steering a morally neutral
course.
   Can science separate the use of human material from the way it
was obtained? That central ethical question of the Nuremburg medical
trials following World War II is being raised again over fetal
tissue research, a new frontier of medicine.
   ``The only answer to this obviously is the answer ... which our
whole culture is in anguish over: Are these people (fetuses) human
beings?'' said the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus, a Lutheran theologian
who was among more than 500 signers of an interfaith letter urging
the federal government to ban funding for research using
intentionally aborted fetuses.
   ``If we learned anything from the medical trials at Nuremberg, it
is that science is not in itself good. It can be used for good or
evil,'' said Richard Doerflinger, associate director of the Office
of Pro-Life Activities of the U.S. Catholic Conference. ``Our point
is, the way science is implemented has to respect human dignity.''
   On the other side there are human concerns, too.
   For decades, a 52-year-old patient of Dr. Curt Freed has suffered
from degenerative Parkinson's disease but now, after implants of
fetal tissue to the brain, the man is improving, said Freed of the
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver.
   The implants may alleviate the sudden loss of function and other
symptoms that Parkinson's sufferers endure. ``They may find
themselves frozen sitting in church, for example,'' Freed said. ``It
would be that kind of phenomenon, eliminating freezing episodes.''
   A special National Institutes of Health advisory committee
decided last December it would be ``acceptable'' for the federal
government to back medical research involving the transplant of
tissue of intentionally aborted fetuses.
   And a month later, at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, Stanford University
President Donald Kennedy classified right-to-life advocates who
would ban all research with fetal tissues as among ``the enemies of
scientific progress.''
   Researchers hope that transplanting fetal cells into people with
diabetes and Parkinson's disease may provide an effective treatment,
and also see the potential such research has for similarly treating
other serious diseases such as Alzheimer's.
   Tissue can be obtained elsewhere, including from the patient's
own body, but some experts say fetal tissue has the advantages of
eliminating the need for surgery on the patient to gather the tissue
and its immaturity may make it more adaptable.
   ``We must separate the issue of abortion from medical research,''
said the chairman of the NIH advisory committee, retired federal
appeals Judge Arlin M. Adams of Philadelphia.
   The committee recommended guidelines such as prohibiting profits
from the sale f fetal tissue, but the panel's majority opinion was
that the ethics of where the tissue was obtained largely should not
be considered.
   If not used, fetal brain cells and other tissues would simply be
discarded, say many researchers who see no reflection of the moral
abyss of the Nazi era.
   ``From my perspective, the bottom line is, once a woman decides
she's going to have an abortion ... I just don't understand why it
(fetal tissue) shouldn't be used,'' said Dr. Myron Genel, a
professor of pediatrics and an associate dean of the Yale School of
Medicine.
   ``I say this as one who had a substantial number of my family
destroyed in the Holocaust.''
   To others, it's impossible to distance the act of abortion from
the use of resulting fetal tissue.
   ``It's as separate as me being here and you being there and we
being held together by only the one bullet which I have just
fired,'' said the Rev. James Burtchaell, a member of the NIH panel
who dissented from its report. ``It's an absurd claim.''
   Burtchaell, a professor of moral theology at the University of
Notre Dame, said government sponsorship of fetal tissue research
would be the most powerful expression of public approval of abortion
since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade.
   The ambivalence and misgivings that make the abortion decision so
painful for some women ``could easily be relieved by the
rationalization, yes, this is a tragic thing, but some good could
come out of it,'' Burtchaell said.
   If the research becomes profitable, ethical concerns may be
forgotten, Neuhaus added.
   ``Health is big bucks, superbucks, mega bucks. ... There are few
things Americans are willing to pay more for than health for the
prolongation of life,'' he said. ``The commercial dynamics are
powerfully on the side of blocking out moral reflection. It is not
in any way far-fetched to envision that in not too many years every
hospital will have a parts shop.''
   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at
the University of Minnesota, sees a ``vexing moral problem'' with
using aborted fetal tissue and believes research must be closely
regulated.
   Fetal tissue should be handled, he said, through a third-party
system like that used for organ donations.
   Such donations are regulated to separate the physicians awaiting
the organ from the patient's treatment, in order to assure the
patient, as Caplan put it, ``I'm not trying to kill you to get your
parts.''
   It also is no longer simply academic speculation that someone
might create life to destroy it for valuable tissue, Caplan said.
``I know of three people who have been willing to get pregnant to
donate tissue either to themselves or a family member.''
   Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committe, who serves on
the New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, finds compelling
arguments on both sides.
   Rudin said he has no objection to the use of fetal tissue for
medical research, but he is worried that the practice may encourage
abortions and eventually may lead to poor women selling fetal tissue.
   ``I was raised where science was going to answer all our
problems,'' Rudin said.
   But science per se is neutral, Rudin said. ``Our moral and public
policy guidelines are just now catching up with what we're capable
of doing.''

<HEAD>Mutual Fund Taxes: A Matter of Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For mutual fund investors who don't keep careful
records, tax time can bring some big-league headaches.
   Like anybody else, fund investors can turn the labors of filling
out the forms over to a hired expert familiar with all the twists
and turns of the tax code.
   But even an accounting wizard can't do much for them if they
don't have the proper records of all their activity.
   Suppose you cashed in half of a $10,000 holding of fund shares in
1988 to treat yourself to a hard-earned vacation. How much of that
$5,000 is subject to tax?
   It depends on your ``cost basis'' for those shares, which can be
computed in several different ways.
   The cost basis includes not only the cash you used to buy into
the fund but any dividends and capital gains distributions that were
subsequently reinvested in additional shares.
   ``Investors sometimes sell fund shares without realizing that
reinvested dividends have raised their total cost basis,'' observes
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in its weekly advisory publication, The
Outlook. ``So they pay taxes on the income a second time.''
   Let's assume, for the sake of illustration, that you began
investing in Hypothetical Fund several years ago with $5,000. Over
the five subsequent years, the fund paid dividends and capital gains
distributions totaling $2,500.
   Even though you had the payouts automatically reinvested in
additional shares, you were obliged to report them as taxable income
in the year they were made.
   Then suppose that last year, at a point when your investment was
worth $10,000, you wearied of the ups and downs of the stock and
bond markets and switched it into a money fund.
   Such switches are considered tantamount to selling one investment
and buying another, creating what accountants call a ``taxable
event.''
   If you thought of your cost as only your original cash outlay,
that left you with a capital gain of $5,000.
   But if you had kept a file of statements from the fund over the
years, you would be able to determine, and to substantiate, that
your cost basis was actually $7,500, thus cutting your taxable gain
in half.
   In the real world, of course, even modest mutual fund accounts
are rarely as simple as that example, with its convenient round
numbers. Many fund investors make multiple purchases over time in
their efforts to accumulate a nest egg.
   All that, however, only makes good record-keeping more important.
The right records are essential if you want to take advantage of a
system called the ``actual cost'' method of determining your tax
liability when you sell.
   Let's say you made purchases of a fund at times when its net
asset value stood at $10 and $14, and now you want to redeem some of
your shares with the net asset value back down at $12.
   If you can identify the shares in your redemption letter as those
you bought for $14, and get confirmation from the fund that it
followed your instructions specifically, that allows you to claim a
capital loss that may be deductible on your tax return.
   ``The key to this method is detailed and accurate record
keeping,'' says Donoghue's Moneyletter, an advisory publication on
matters of personal finance.
   ``You have to accurately document what you buy or sell, when and
for how much. But your effort is well worth it.''

<HEAD>USDA Foreign Attaches Not Noted for Linguistics, Says GAO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In most cases, says a federal review, the
people hired by the Agriculture Department to be the eyes and ears
of American farmers in foreign countries can't talk turkey unless
the conversation is in English.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative agency of
Congress, found the language gap in the Foreign Agricultural
Service, which has maintained an overseas network of agricultural
attaches for more than 30 years to help promote U.S. farm
commodities.
   During the 1988 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30, the
service _ primarily at U.S. embassies _ operated 65 posts and 14
agricultural trade offices overseas with 103 attaches responsible
for representing U.S. farm interests in more than 100 countries.
   The agency also employs about 160 foreign nationals to help
attaches in those offices. Last year's budget for those foreign
operations was $24.8 million.
   Rep. E. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, asked for a review of the attache system. The
GAO report was submitted to him last month.
   Historically, the report said, the criticism of the USDA agency
has focused on requirements that the attaches make too many reports
that take time away from market development functions. Recent
changes have helped ease that situation, but further improvements
should be made.
   One of the most glaring deficiencies in the Foreign Agricultural
Service involves language skills, the GAO said, which are necessary
``to effectively communicate'' in host countries.
   ``The service has not formally set minimum proficiency levels for
the principal language of the country to which the attache is
assigned,'' the report said. ``The service believes that a
speaking-reading proficiency level of 3 (based on a 0 to 5 scale) is
sufficient to perform the general business activities of attaches
but that a higher proficiency level is required to conduct sensitive
or technical negotiations.''
   Among 93 attaches assigned as of September 1987 to countries with
non-English languages, only 24 _ 26 percent _ had at least the level
3 proficiency, the report said.
   By comparison, a list of 1,021 State Department employees
assigned to Foreign Service jobs showed that 676, or 66 percent,
showed at least a level 3 language proficiency.
   The FAS told investigators that some of the attaches (which
included trade officers and higher-ranked agricultural counselors
for purposes of the review) had not yet completed five years of
foreign service, the minimum time allowed for achieving language
proficiency.
   Others had been commissioned as attaches in languages different
from that required in posts at the time of the review, and sometimes
under different standards prior to current requirements.
   Also, the agency said, ``foreign service nationals,'' or FSNs,
can readily provide translations needed to gather and read
information in a foreign language in the overseas posts.
   The GAO report concluded that attaches ``generally appear to
possess acceptable levels of education and experience'' when they
are accepted as overseas candidates but that ``the majority of
attaches seem to fall short in their ability to communicate
effectively in the principal foreign language practiced in their
host countries.''
   Thomas O. Kay, administrator of the Foreign Agricultural Service,
said in a letter responding to the GAO report that the agency
``fully concurs'' that language efficiency should be improved.
   ``And we are already doing more,'' he said. ``We have designated
five languages _ Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Arabic and Russian as
hard languages _ and we are now providing a year's language
training.''
   Kay said the agency's policy is to rotate overseas staff back to
Washington more frequently before going out to another job and that
this will also help ``assure that they get more adequate language
training.''
   But Kay said that ``due to personnel and monetary restraints''
the agency cannot provide extensive training in seldom-used
languages that attaches would be only expected to serve once in
their careers, or in posts where English is widely used.
   Kay included a list of U.S. posts in countries where a foreign
language is not required. Those are: United Kingdom, Australia, New
Zealand, Canada, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, South
Africa, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines.
   In addition, the agency operates in five overseas posts ``where
English will suffice'' for attaches: Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark,
Rome and Geneva.

   In theory, the Supreme Court is insulated from politics. But that
isn't stopping the opposing sides on the abortion issue from
mounting intense lobbying campaigns as the justices prepare to hear
a controversial Missouri case that could end the country's current
era of legal abortions.
   The Supreme Court is expected to hear the appeal, Webs, which favors
abortion on demand.
   ``Our people want the Supreme Court and President Bush, who's
pushing the court on this issue, to know just how they feel,'' she
said. ``We are co-sponsoring what promises to be a massive march in
Washington on April 9th and I won't be surprised if a quarter of a
million demonstrators show up; our people are furious.''
   O'Dell, who is coordinating NOW's role in the march, said she
thinks a big turnout won't go unnoticed at the court.
   ``Whatever the decision is,'' she said, ``it will be couched in
legal terms but, in fact, it is a political question that, like
Prohibition, ultimately will be decided by public opinion.''
   Judie Brown, president of the American Life League which opposes
legalized abortions, said she, too, thinks political considerations
will weigh heavily in the Supreme Court's decision.
   ``Public opinion means everything to the court,'' said Brown, who
says her organization includes 200,000 families around the country.
``We feel all forms of expression will impact on the court.''
   The American Life League's most expensive form of expression will
be a series of full-page advertisements in USA Today, The Washington
Post and The Washington Times. The ads will run during the week
before the opposition's April march and will cost $150,000.
   ``They will include just-released information we've taken from
the file of the late Justice William O. Douglas during the debate on
Roe vs. Wade,'' she said. ``It's clear from these files that a small
but very vocal minority was able to influence the decision which
made abortion legal in this country.''
   In Roe vs. Wade, the court held that while a woman's right to
privacy gives her the right to have an abortion, the state may
regulate or prohibit abortions once the fetus is viable.
   Since the 1973 decision, there have been relatively few
third-trimester abortions even though that same court, in Doe vs.
Bolton, said the mother's life or health should be an overriding
factor in the decision of whether to permit an abortion even after
the fetus is viable.
   In case to be in April, the Missouri Legislature passed a 1986
statute banning abortions at public hospitals or any other public
facilities unless the woman's life is in danger. The act, whose
preamble states that viability begins at conception, also forbids
public funds from being used for abortions or for abortion
counseling except when the mother's life is threatened.
   The statute was challenged immediately by two abortion clinics,
Reproductive Health Services of St. Louis and Planned Parenthood in
Kansas City.
   In March 1987, a federal district judge in Kansas City declared
the major sections of the statute to be unconstitutional
infringements of Roe vs. Wade. In July 1987, the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the bulk of the lower court's decision.
   Last year, William Webster, Missouri's attorney general, asked
the Supreme Court to review the case. He also asked the court, if it
should side with the appeals courts, to then consider whether Roe
vs. Wade itself is constitutional.
   The Supreme Court announced in January it would consider the
case, setting off a flurry of planning and activity on both sides of
the issue.
   ``We've already raised most of the $150,000 for our upcoming
newspaper ads,'' Brown said, adding that $150,000 is an
exceptionally large expenditure for the American Life League.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League already has spent more
than $500,000 on newspaper advertising. The full-page ads, which
feature a coat hanger, a reminder of the days of back-alley
abortions, first ran on Jan. 22.
   ``We're running them in some of the major newspapers across the
country,'' said Kate Michelman, NARAL's executive director. ``We're
also doing radio and TV ads and making ourselves available to the
media for interviews and talk shows and the like.''
   So far, she said, there has been a tremendous response to the
ads, which ask for pledges of support.
   ``We've had more than 30,000 responses to the January ads,'' she
said. ``The ads cost $300,000 and we took in $350,000.''
   Michelman said while NARAL sees a drawn-out fight over the
abortion issue, she feels the Supreme Court can be influenced.
   ``There's no doubt we're in trouble, given the changes in the
court since Roe vs. Wade,'' she said. ``But the Supreme Court
doesn't act in a vacuum; it is sensitive to the political and social
climate of the country.''
   Because of this, said David Andrews, acting president of the
Planned Parenthood Federation of America, his group is trying to
mobilize mainstream Americans.
   ``There's no question this is a political issue and, while the
Supreme Court can't be lobbied directly, it can influenced by a
great outpouring of voices,'' he said.
   Barbara MacGear of Operation Rescue, a Binghamton, N.Y.-based,
pro-life group which has helped stage protests at abortion clinics
around the country, said, ``We plan keeping with our agenda'' of
demonstrations and civil disobedience.
   ``Frankly,'' she added, ``I don't know whether the Supreme Court
can be swayed by what happens in the streets but we're watching
closely. What we're really hoping for, though, is a right-to-life
amendment to the U.S. Constitution.''
   Douglas Johnson, legal director of the National Right-To-Life
Committee, acknowledged that the court's acceptance of the Missouri
case and the resulting news media focus have ``provided an unusual
forum.''
   He said he has been ``kind of amused'' by some of the efforts to
get the Supreme Court's attention.
   ``In our view,'' he said, ``these efforts are unlikely to
influence the case. Our legal brief certainly isn't going to talk
about the Harris Poll, it talks about the Constitution.''
   Then, he added, ``but Roe vs. Wade was a political decision, an
act of judicial lawmaking.''

<HEAD>Italian Financier Denounces Report of Money Laundering, Mafia Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Giancarlo Parretti, the Italian financier
trying to assemble a Hollywood movie powerhouse, denounced news
reports suggesting he has been involved in money laundering and has
ties to the Mafia.
   Parretti, who with a partner has in recent months bought
controlling interests in the Cannon Group Inc., New World
Entertainment Inc. and Pathe Cinema of France, said in a news
release that the money for the purchases came from legitimate
sources.
   Reports in the trade and financial press have questioned the
source of Parretti's money, as he and his partner, Florio Fiorini,
invest with the avowed goal of becoming a significant force in
Hollywood.
   A Business Week magazine article March 13 quoted unidentified
associates of Parretti and Fiorini as saying the pair's network of
foreign holding companies include money-laundering operations. The
magazine said associates of Fiorini have warned him that Parretti
has ties with Sicilian crime families.
   ``The article makes untrue and baseless accusations of money
laundering,'' Parretti said in his news release Monday, citing
outside audits of his companies. ``The suggestion of supposed `close
ties with Sicilian crime families' is slanderous and totally false.''
   The magazine's editor in chief, Stephen B. Shepard, responded in
a statement: ``We have nothing to add except to note that Business
Week already printed Mr. Parretti's denial in our story.''
   Parretti, through an employee, refused an interview request
Tuesday.
   Parretti, born in Orvieto, Italy, has been charged with criminal
offenses twice in that country and jailed briefly, according to
Business Week and an article last week in the Wall Street Journal.
   He was acquitted of charges that he defrauded a bank that failed
in Palermo and is awaiting trial on charges stemming from alleged
misstatement of the balance sheet of his soccer team, Siracusa
Calcio in Sicily, the magazine said.
   Additionally, Parretti was arrested in Rome in 1986, but the
extortion charge was dropped, Business Week said.
   Parretti says he and his partner intend to assemble their various
movie assets into an entertainment conglomerate under the name Pathe
Entertainment. It will be headed by moviemaker Alan Ladd Jr., who
brought ``Star Wars'' to the screen, they say.
   Through holding companies, Parretti and Fiorini control Melia
International, a Spanish travel agency, and Renta Inmobiliaria, a
Spanish real estate firm. Separately, Fiorini is part-owner of
Sasea, a Swiss merchant bank.
   They recently bid $22 million for De Laurentiis Entertainment
Group Inc., which is in Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy proceedings,
and have hinted interest in MGM-UA Communications Co. Reported
prices for the pair's recent acquisitions include $150 million for
Pathe of France and $138 million for New World.
   Financing for the recent acquisitions was arranged through Credit
Lyonnais of France and public and private equity and revenue from
the pair's various firms, Parretti said.

   A federal judge refused to order Eastern Airlines
pilots back to work, although Eastern warned it couldn't otherwise
survive the 4-day-old Machinists strike. A spin-off job action by
pilots nationwide failed to clog airports as feared.
   Earlier Tuesday, Eastern sent 2,500 more non-union workers home,
blaming pilots for leaving it with ``no business on the books.''
   Company attorney David Ross warned during a court hearing that
Eastern was faced with bankruptcy without its 3,600 pilots, who have
firmly refused to cross picket lines the Machinists union set up

   EDITOR'S NOTE: Business Writer Marcy Gordon, covering the Eastern
Airlines strike in Miami, flew to New York on Tuesday, the first day
of a pilot job action to strictly follow safety procedures.

<TEXT>
   For patrons of the heavily traveled Atlantic
Coast air routes, a by-the-book pilot job action to support Eastern
Airlines strikers had little effect, but that didn't stop people
from talking and griping about it.
   The travails of the airline industry seemed to be on many
passenger minds Tuesday, the first day of the job action by the Air
Line Pilots Association in response to what the union called safety
concerns raised by the Eastern strike.
   If a Miami-Atlanta-Washington-New York itinerary was any
indication, there were delays of up to an hour for reasons that
ranged from bad weather to luggage-loading, runway deicing and
overbooking. That could be any typical flying day during the winter
on one of the nation's most congested air routes.
   But when a nearly full Delta Air Lines flight from Miami to
Atlanta was waylaid for what the cockpit crew called a cargo delay,
many passengers immediately suspected the pilots were behind it and
weren't pleased.
   ``I think it's in poor taste. Nobody wins,'' said Melton
Johnston, a merchant marine captain en route to Bermuda. Another
passenger, Franco Lizenzi, a Miami engineer, said, ``I think they're
doing it more out of sympathy.''
   At a layover in Atlanta's sprawling Hartsfield International
Airport, Eastern counters were eerily empty, their erstwhile patrons
swarming to alternate flights on Delta, the region's dominant
airline.
   Eastern pickets walked peacefully, saying they weren't surprised
at their employer's decision to ground most flights in response to
the refusal by pilots and flight attendants to honor a strike by the
Machinists union.
   ``Finally, the company was truthful with the American flying
public,'' said Vince Garland, a 10{-year Eastern pilot. He said the
pilot slowdown ``demonstrated that ALPA is united in our support of
the Machinists' position.''
   Later, on a fully booked Atlanta-Washington Delta flight, the
plane was delayed half an hour at the terminal because of what
agents called a delay at Washington's National Airport for runway
deicing.
   Shortly before the plane began its descent, the cockpit crew
informed passengers the plane would have to circle because of an
unspecified air traffic problem at National.
   ``We really can't adequately explain the delay,'' the flight
captain said. That riled some business passengers already miffed
about the earlier stall.
   ``The pilots are antagonizing the public,'' said a company
executive, who spoke with a reporter but didn't want to be quoted by
name. ``They're making me upset right now and that's stupid.''

<HEAD>Drexel Chief Executive Cites Government Pressure To Fire Milken</HEAD>

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. opposed part of the
Wall Street firm's landmark securities fraud settlement but went
along with it out of fear the government would bring more serious
charges, Drexel's chief executive is quoted as saying in court
papers.
   Drexel agreed to dismiss bond trader Michael Milken and withhold
his pay depite the company's disagreement with the terms, Chief
Executive Frederick H. Joseph said in a separate filing Tuesday.
   It was the first time Drexel publicly asserted that the firm
opposed parts of the $650 million criminal plea agreement reached in
December.
   Lawyers for Milken said Joseph told employees that Drexel settled
because the government planned to bring charges under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corruption Organizations act that could
have frozen billions of dollars of the firm's assets.
   The documents were filed in Manhattan federal court as part of a
challenge by Milken and his brother, Lowell, also a Drexel
executive, to provisions of the criminal settlement that capped a
two-year investigation of securities law violations.
   ``They were going to indict us under RICO ... (and) there would
be a multihundred-million-dollar forefeiture,'' Joseph said Jan. 6
in a telephone hookup with employees, papers filed by the Milkens
stated.
   ``We ultimately concluded the bottom line was the firm absolutely
had to settle _ that a financial institution cannot stand up to a
RICO indictment,'' he stated, according to the court papers.
   The plea agreement forces Drexel to dismiss Michael Milken and
withhold his more than $100 million in 1988 pay and keep at least
half of Lowell Milken's pay and fire him if he is indicted.
   Joseph said in an accompanying affidavit that the Milken
provisions ``were initiated by the government and inserted in the
plea agreement at the government's request.''
   He said Drexel opposed the action but took them ``in order to
reach an overall agreement with the government.'' He said Drexel
would be willing to pay the Milkens if not for the pact.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said the government would
have no comment on the filings. A hearing on the Milkens' motion is
set for March 14.
   One week ago, Joseph filed a supporting affidavit for the
government in the same case, admitting that Drexel ``entered into
the plea agreement voluntarily and without coercion after consulting
with counsel.''
   The government has said the possibility of indictment on more
serious charges does not constitute coercion and that Drexel was not
threatened with RICO charges during negotiations.
   The Milkens are asking U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to reject
or modify the settlement, under which Drexel has agreed to pay $650
million in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies,
because it violates the Milkens' rights.
   To show Milken was under contract with Drexel, his attorney
Tuesday submitted a 1975 agreement _ still in effect last year _
stating the high-yield ``junk'' bond trader is entitled to a minimum
of 15 percent of any profits under $1 million to 35 percent of
department profits over $8 million.
   Michael Milken is one of the biggest targets of a federal
securities fraud crackdown and is expected to be indicted on fraud
and racketeering charges. He was named in a civil suit filed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission against Drexel last September but
faces no criminal charges and has denied any wrongdoing.
   The criminal plea cannot take effect until the SEC settles civil
charges with Drexel. Negotiations are continuing.

<HEAD>Favorable Ruling In England Boosts High Voltage Takeover Hopes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A favorable ruling by the London Stock Exchange
won praise from High Voltage Engineering Corp. but was dismissed as
``an interesting sidelight'' by the company's takeover target,
Universal Foods Corp.
   The London exchange decided Tuesday that Berisford International
PLC, a British food company financing High Voltage's $643 million,
$35-a-share bid for Milwaukee-based Universal Foods, does not have
to ask its shareholders to approve its role in the takeover.
   ``We're very excited,'' said Clifford Press, deputy chairman of
High Voltage.
   Press said that, in light of the decision, High Voltage and
Berisford are considering changing a provision under which a change
of ownership of High Voltage or Berisford would allow the other to
purchase the stake in Universal Foods.
   Press said the attempt to bring Berisford into the takeover
action has been ``a complete sideshow, a desperate effort (by
Universal Foods) to avoid dealing with us. We're pleased it's been
put to bed.''
   But Paula Norton, a Universal Foods spokeswoman, discounted the
impact of the Berisford decision.
   ``Berisford's problem with its shareholders is an interesting
sidelight,'' she said. ``But it's just that; it's peripheral to the
issues being decided by Judge (Joseph) Stadtmueller.''
   She was referring to High Voltage's effort to get Universal
Foods' anti-takeover defenses overturned in U.S. District Court in
Milwaukee.
   High Voltage launched the takeover attempt for Universal Foods in
December. The Burlington, Mass.-based company is owned jointly by
Berisford and two New York investors.
   Universal Foods, seeking to have the High Voltage takeover
attempt halted, has argued that Berisford failed to reveal its exact
role in the takeover bid, in violation of the requirements of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Universal Foods stock closed Tuesday at $34.75 a share, up $1.50,
on volume of 514,800 shares.
   Berisford also said Tuesday that it hopes to renegotiate its
partnership with Hyde Park Holdings of Massachusetts. Berisford and
Hyde Park own equal stakes in High Voltage.
   The decision to seek changes in the partnership accord was
Berisford's first public response to complaints from Associated
British Foods PLC, which owns a 24 percent stake in Berisford.
   Associated British Foods argues that the partnership accord may
constitute a so-called poison pill that would discourage any company
considering a takeover of Berisford.
   Associated British Foods also has sought to have Berisford submit
details of its role in the Universal Foods bid for shareholder
approval.

   Wall Street analysts have dismissed rumors that
Time Inc. might receive a takeover bid more lucrative than the media
giant's planned $18 billion merger with Warner Communications Inc.
   But investors were captivated by the idea of a possible outside
offer, and bid Time stock up $9.25 a share Tuesday to $116.75 in
heavy New York Stock Exchange trading. Warner, meanwhile, rose 62{
cents to close at $48.87{.
   Time has been the target of persistent takeover rumors, but the
analysts rejected the latest talk and predicted the company's plans
to merge with Warner through an exchange of stock would go through.
   ``It would be puzzling that anyone would necessarily (make a bid)
now, because of the discount value (Time has) traded at for years,''
said Mary Kukowski, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``There's
been a window of opportunity and no one did it before, so why do it
now?''
   Jay Nelson, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman Inc., said
``the odds are better than 50-50'' against a bid, partly because of
the anti-takeover atmosphere in Washington after the late 1988 wave
of multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts.
   Members of Congress and the Bush administration have suggested
steps be taken to curb takeovers following the record $24.53 billion
buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Big buyouts financed through heavy borrowing, such as the RJR
Nabisco deal, are seen as un-American, Nelson said, while Time and
Warner ``are positioning the deal as pro-America and pro-business.''
   ``If I read Congress correctly, they would prefer to see someone
run the business and not break it up and lay off employees,'' Nelson
said. Time and Warner say no jobs will be lost as a result of their
merger, and that the combined company will be better able to compete
with other international media giants.
   Although investors focused Tuesday on Time, they continued buying
stock in other media companies, whose stock prices rose sharply
Monday in industry-wide takeover speculation.
   Gulf &amp; Western Corp., owner of Paramount Pictures Corp., rose
$1.25 to $47.12{ a share Tuesday, while MCA Inc. rose $1.25 to close
at $54.25.
   CBS Inc., which soared $6 on Monday, finished down $2.12{ at $170
on Tuesday.
   Other questions about the Time-Warner merger lingered, such as
the possible opposition of Chris-Craft Industries Inc., Warner's
largest shareholder.
   When the Warner board voted 12-0 with one abstention to approve
the merger, Chris-Craft Chairman Herbert J. Siegel was the
abstaining director, according to a Warner source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Siegel, who has bickered with Warner Chairman Steven Ross for
years, has kept an uncharacteristically low profile since the
Time-Warner deal was announced. He did not return a reporter's
telephone calls seeking comment on the merger.
   Chris-Craft acquired its stake when it helped Warner fight an
unwanted takeover by media giant Rupert Murdoch in 1984, but Siegel
tried to stop Warner's recent acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures
Corp. In the past, he and Ross argued about the makeup of the Warner
board and the size of Ross' salary.
   But analysts, noting that Siegel's power will be diluted in the
merger, said he won't be able to stop the deal.
   Warner officials say Siegel's stake in the new company will
decline to 6 percent to 7 percent from his current 11 percent Warner
share, while the amount of shareholder votes he controls will drop
to 14.2 percent from the 17 percent he controls at Warner.
   Chris-Craft stock closed down 12{ cents a share at $33.37{
following a $3.75-a-share rise on Monday.

<HEAD>Critics Say Time Warner Merger Could Reduce Variety on Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed merger of the media giant Time Inc.
and entertainment producer Warner Communications Inc. could lead to
fewer programming choices on their huge cable system operations,
critics say.
   Both companies own cable systems that are among the five largest
in the nation. The combination would rank second behind the biggest
cable operator, Tele-Communications Inc.
   The proposed Time-Warner combination could ``diminish the free
flow of information,'' said Andrew Schwartzman, executive director
of Media Access Project, which describes itself as a public interest
law firm.
   He said Tuesday that the combined cable operations may turn to
the programming produced by sister businesses at Warner _ which has
major movie and television production operations _ rather than buy
it from independent producers.
   ``It will affect the prices paid for programming and the variety
and diversity of programming that is available and impair the
ability of other companies to come in and compete effectively,''
Schwartzman said.
   Tom Rogers, president of NBC Cable, the General Electric Co.
division that is preparing to launch a new cable network, Consumer
News and Business Channel, said the merger could make it tougher to
get a big audience for CNBC.
   Rogers said cable systems with 12.5 million subscribers already
have signed up for CNBC, ahead of earlier projections for the
service's launch.
   But he said Time has refused to put the service on its cable
systems, adding that could be because Time has the right to take
over another cable service, Cable News Network, if CNN's owner,
Turner Broadcasting Corp., is sold.
   ``If Warner is merged into Time, that is 5.5 million subscribers
that are outside CNBC distribution,'' he said.
   Michael Luftman, a spokesman for Time's American Television and
Communications Corp., said it was premature to speculate how the
combination would affect programming choices.
   But he said that once the merger is completed, the cable systems
will be run fairly autonomously even though one person will oversee
both of them.
   Paula Greer, an analyst for the media research firm Paul Kagan &amp;
Associates of Carmel, Calif., said the combined cable operation
probably would be able to command a cheaper rate for programming
than the systems paid as separate entities. She said there also may
be economies of scale in combining some of their administrative
operations.
   She said the combination extends a trend toward consolidation in
the cable business, which has raised concerns that the operators,
who have been freed from federal rate regulation, will boost their
prices.
   Those fears were not borne out last year, the first year of full
rate deregulation, when the average basic cable rate rose about 10
percent, down from a 19.7 percent rise the previous year, she said.
   Time owns 82 percent of American Television, based in Stamford,
Conn. It is the second-biggest cable system operator, with about 4
million basic subscribers.
   Warner Cable Communications, based in New York, has about 1.5
million basic subscribers and ranks fifth among operators.
   But a combined Time Warner cable company still would trail
Denver-based TCI, which has about 9.7 million subscribers. That
figure includes its share of subscribers to systems in which it has
a part interest, Kagan said.
   Officials of Time and Warner told securities analysts earlier
this week that they anticipated no serious antitrust problems with
their merger, which was announced Saturday. The merger requires
stockholder approval.
   They said Time Warner may have to sell American Television's
cable system in Southern California, which has 30,000 subscribers,
because of Warner's minority interest in BHC Inc., which owns
television station KCOP in Los Angeles.
   The government prohibits companies from operating a television
station and a cable system in the same market.

<HEAD>Checks Given To Ford Workers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty-two Ford Motor Co. employees got a
little extra along with their profit-sharing checks _ a brief chat
with the company's vice chairman.
   Harold Poling dropped by Ford's sprawling Rouge complex on
Tuesday to hand out profit-sharing checks of about $2,800 apiece to
workers at the Dearborn assembly and stamping plants.
   Poling chatted briefly with Betsy Cole, a Ford employee for 16
years, who's been at the Dearborn assembly plant for 13 of them.
   ``I told him I was going to put it down on a new car,'' she said
after talking with Poling. She said she hasn't decided which car she
would buy, but it definitely would be a Ford.
   A little further down the line, Joe Hines got his check and told
Poling it would go for his daughter's college tuition. Hines, 62,
has been a Ford employee for 35 years.
   And before heading to the line, Poling gave a check to Fred
McNulty of Garden City, who's been working at Ford's Dearborn
assembly plant for 25 years.
   ``I already put it in a money market account,'' he said. ``I've
always have put it in a money market.''
   Poling said that if a Ford employee had been around to collect
all six profit-sharing checks the automaker has issued, the worker
would have received about $12,200.
   ``Despite my reputation as a cost-cutter, I'm a strong believer
in profit sharing, count on it,'' he said before his stroll by an
assembly line on which new Mustangs rolled past.
   More than 152,000 workers received their checks Tuesday. The
amount was the second-highest in auto industry history and far
outpaced those of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp., which
will distribute their profit-sharing checks later this month.
   GM has said its typical worker will receive $254, while
Chrysler's average check will be about $720.
   Profit-sharing among each of the nation's Big Three automakers is
based on financial performance in their North American operations.
Profit for those activities must reach certain levels for
profit-sharing to kick in.
   Ford and GM began distributing profit-sharing checks in early
1984, and Ford has continued every year since.
   GM, which will mail this year's checks March 14 to about 450,000
hourly and salaried workers, had no profit-sharing payments in 1987
or 1988.
   Chrysler will distribute its profit-sharing checks Friday to more
than 82,000 hourly and salaried workers. The No. 3 automaker didn't
begin profit-sharing payments until this year, but handed out $500
checks to employees in each of the past two years in lieu of profit
sharing.
   Last year, Ford provided about $3,700 per employee in
profit-sharing, the largest in the five-year history of the payments
by automakers. The lowest amount Ford workers have received was
about $400 each in 1984.
   While some Ford employees celebrated this year's profit-sharing
checks with dinners or long-planned purchases, others never will see
the money.
   Last year, in an agreement between Ford and the Wayne County
Friend of the Court, the company withheld profit-sharing checks for
more than 2,300 employees who were behind more than $500 in
child-support payments.
   For the most part, though, Tuesday was a happy day at Ford
factories.
   ``It makes the whole year worth it,'' said Reginald White, a
quality upgrader at the Dearborn assembly plant.

<HEAD>Stocks Down On News Of New Scandal Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index fell today
after word of new arrests in a major stock-profiteering scandal, and
the dollar fell against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 61.08 points
Tuesday, fell 100.28 points, or 0.31 percent, closing at 31,837.66.
   After gains in early trading, news of the arrests discouraged
investors, said a dealer with Nomura Securities, Japan's largest
brokerage.
   Prosecutors today arrested former Labor Ministry official Takashi
Kato, 58, for allegedly receiving bribes from the employment
information conglomerate Recruit Co. Former Recruit executive Masao
Tatsumi, 46, was arrested for allegedly offering bribes.
   This brought to 12 the number of arrests in the case.
   The scandal, uncovered last fall, has shaken the government of
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Three Cabinet ministers, including
Finance Minister Kiichi Mitazawa, have resigned in connection with
the affair.
   ``The news of Wednesday's arrests contributed to the downtrend
because trading already was becoming unstable without incentives for
buying,'' the Nomura dealer said.
   ``Institutional investors, who have big influence on the
direction of trading, lost buying interest, which caused the losses
in the afternoon,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Investors also were waiting for February's U.S. unemployment
figure, due to be announced Friday, the dealer added.
   In active trading, with sell orders outweighing buy orders,
volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1.2 billion
shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar ended at 128.73 yen,
0.30 yen lower than Tuesday's 129.03-yen finish. The dollar opened
at 128.68 yen and ranged between 128.65 yen and 128.90 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate has hardly moved since around 10 a.m.,''
said a dealer with Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo, also requesting
anonymity.
   He also cited caution before announcement of the U.S. jobless
figures.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a news
conference today that he did not see foreign exchange rates as
likely to fluctuate widely, but added that the central bank was
prepared to ``take appropriate measures'' if rates showed
significant changes.

   The dollar was little changed in light European
trading early today.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow
range for the rest of the day.
   ``It's purely a technical market today,'' said a trader at a
major West German bank in Frankfurt. ``The dollar is desperately
searching for a trend, but can't find one.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 128.73 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 128.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8527 West German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.5830
Swiss francs, down from 1.5847; 6.2952 French francs, down from
6.3000; 2.0905 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0945; 1,361.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,362.37; 1.2005 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1985.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7225 from $1.7220 late
Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $391.75 a troy ounce, up
from $391.45 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $393.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $392.70, up from $390.90 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.74 to close at a bid $388.21.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $5.89 a troy
ounce, up from $5.88 bid late Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on the bench less than three
months has until Friday midnight to decide two questions that could
determine the outcome of the Machinists' strike again Eastern.
   One question: Does the Machinists' right to picket railroads,
including Amtrak and Metro-North, mean the railroads' own employees
have a right to observe those picket lines, even if their bosses
order them to work?
   The other: What's the difference between trains and planes?
Specifically, does the fact that this case involves two industries
distinguish it from a 1987 Supreme Court decision involving two
railroads?
   The man on the spot is U.S. District Court Judge Robert P.
Patterson Jr. He was elevated to the bench Dec. 20.
   ``He's ruling in an arcane area of labor law, he's under rea time
pressure, and he's going to have to make new law,'' says a
management labor lawyer speaking on the condition of anonymity.
``This case is out at the edge of where the law is.''
   ``This is arcane stuff even for labor lawyers and veteran
judges,'' said another lawyer who spoke on the same terms. ``This
judge has got some learning to do.''
   In an apparent attempt to force federal intervention, the
Machinists last week announced plans to picket railroad stations as
part of their strike against Eastern.
   But on Sunday, Patterson _ who was spending the weekend upstate
at his country home, Fair Oaks Farm _ issued an order that barred
railroad union members from striking until 3 p.m. Wednesday, and set
a hearing an hour earlier. On Tuesday, he extended his order until
midnight Friday.
   The key decision to which Patterson will be referring is
Burlington Northern Railroad vs. Maintenance of Way Employees, in
which the Supreme Court ruled that the Railway Labor Act of 1926,
which covers railroads and airlines, does not prohibit secondary
strikes. Such strikes are prohibited in most industries by the
Taft-Hartley Act.
   The railroads concede the Machinists' right to picket rail
stations but argue that the railroads have the right to order their
employees to cross those picket lines.
   The railroads' contracts with their unions don't contain explicit
no-strike clauses, which would override the unions' right to honor a
secondary strike. But Robert Bergen, a lawyer for Metro-North, says
his commuter railroad's labor contracts contain ``an implicit
no-strike pledge'' because they stipulate that all disputes be
subject to arbitration.
   Jay Roth of Burbank, Calif., a co-chairman of the American Bar
Association's Railway and Airline Law Committee, disputed that. He
said that unless a labor contract specifically bars a secondary
strike, it is a ``protected act'' under federal law. ``You either
have the right or you don't,'' said Roth, who represents unions.
``I'm at a loss to explain the judge's decision'' to grant the
restraining order.
   The importance of the second question _ Are airlines and
railroads separate industries? _ stems from the fact that years ago,
the fledgling airline unions got themselves covered by the Railway
Labor Act. It subjects railroad workers to a separate body of labor
law from other workers.
   In the Burlington Northern case, the court held that the Railway
Act, by not mentioning secondary strikes or boycotts, implicitly
permitted them. But that case involved several freight lines. Does
the fact that this one involves an airline and several railroads
significantly distinguish it?
   The cross-industry issue may be important for another reason.
With some exceptions, including those outlined in the Taft-Hartley
Act, federal courts lack jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labor
disputes. But the law that established that principle, the Norris-La
Guardia Act, established an exception of its own: cross-industry
secondary strikes.
   That legislation reflected Congress's conviction that strikes
should be economic battles, not political ones, and thus fought only
by unions and companies in the same industry. Whether this applies
to Eastern, Amtrak, Metro-North and company is for Patterson to say.

<HEAD>Soviets Boosting Sales of Nuclear Fuel to American Utilities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department says growing Soviet sales
of nuclear fuel to U.S. electric utilities are costing the federal
government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told Congress the Soviets are
grabbing customers by offering lower prices, and that erosion of the
Energy Department's nuclear fuel program by foreign competition
posed a threat to national security.
   ``With excess capacity and a need for hard currency, the Soviet
Union has been receptive to opportunities to sell enriched uranium
to U.S. utilities both directly and indirectly through brokers,''
Watkins said in a written response to a variety of questions from
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   A text of Watkins' responses was made available Tuesday at the
committee's offices.
   As recently as 1974 the United States was the only supplier of
enriched uranium to nuclear power plants throughout the
non-communist world. Last year the U.S. share of the world market
had plummeted to about 45 percent, Watkins said.
   The Energy Department runs the country's uranium enrichment
operations at plants in Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky. These
plants increase, or ``enrich,'' uranium-235 atoms beyond their
natural concentration for use in nuclear reactors.
   Watkins said the U.S. uranium enrichment operations lost more
than $170 million in sales over the past three years to the Soviets,
who have made about 30 percent of their enrichment capacity
available for foreign sales.
   The United States stands to lose another $1.7 billion to foreign
competition over the next nine years, he said.
   ``Based on proprietary and government confidential commercial
information, the department is concerned that sales of Soviet
enrichment services to U.S. utilitie do in fact pose a very real
threat to DOE's market share,'' Watkins wrote.
   He said the Soviets had succeeded in grabbing new foreign sales
of its enrichment services by offering prices as much as 50 percent
below the U.S. price. He said about half the Soviet sales are made
to U.S. utilities through brokerage firms.
   Watkins provided no further details about specific Soviet
transactions with U.S. utilities.
   Watkins said the Bush administration was preparing a legislative
proposal to create a government corporation that would take over the
Energy Department's uranium enrichment operations in order to
restore their competitiveness.
   ``The department does not have the flexibility or discretion to
compete effectively in the tight world market which has developed,''
Watkins said, adding that maintaining a healthy uranium enrichment
business ``has important energy security and national security
implications.''
   The plants also supply enriched uranium for the government's
defense nuclear reactors.
   A 1985 Congressional Budget Office study attributed the loss of
U.S. dominance in nuclear fuel sales to concern in foreign countries
about the reliability of U.S. supplies. Many nations also objected
to restrictions on nuclear fuel use that were enforced through U.S.
enrichment contracts, the study said.
   Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., introduced a bill last month that
would prohibit U.S. utilities from directly or indirectly purchasing
Soviet enrichment services. She expressed concern that the United
States could become too dependent on the Soviets for nuclear fuel,
posing a potential threat to national security.
   Watkins also said the Bush administration is committed to
completing a program designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a
new technology for enriching uranium. The technology, called the
Advanced Vapor Laser Isotope Separation process, would allow the
United States to compete with the lower Soviet prices.
   Watkins said the department needed $500 million between 1989 and
1991 to complete the demonstration program. He said the process
could be put into operation by 1996. The administration has
requested $148 million for it for the coming budget year.

<HEAD>Committee Advances Bill to Push Bush on Eastern Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are moving to force
President Bush to intervene in the Eastern Airlines strike, but
spokesmen for the company say it may not survive long enough for the
bill to pass.
   A subcommittee voted 21-12 Tuesday to advance the bill directing
Bush to call a presidential emergency panel to mediate the strike,
now in its fifth day.
   But Clark H. Onstad, senior vice president of Eastern's parent
company, Texas Air Corp., told the panel that Eastern's survival is
``open to question'' if pilots continue to honor striking
machinists' picket lines.
   The strike has stopped all but a few Eastern flights and caused
the company to nearly shut down, laying off all but 1,500 of its
nearly 11,000 nonunion employees.
   The battle pits Bush against Democrats and organized labor, which
sent its top official, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland, to testify
Tuesday in support of the bill to force the president to call an
emergency panel to mediate. Creation of the panel would end the
strike for up to 60 days.
   Kirkland suggested that Bush's failure to act gets him off to a
bad start with labor, but Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
said he would recommend a veto if the measure passes.
   The Public Works' aviation subcommittee voted to send the bill to
the full committee which is expected to take it up on Thursday.
   House action is expected by the middle of next week. The bill
also would have to pass the Senate. If the president vetoes it, a
two-thirds vote of both houses would be required to override.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, said after the subcommittee vote that the Eastern
strike is the ``wrong issue for organized labor.''
   He said the bill would have a rough ride in the Senate, where
rules allow any opponent to tie it up. Even if it passes both
houses, he said, there are not enough votes to reject a veto.
   ``Organized labor is almost certainly in a power struggle it will
lose to the president,'' said Gingrich.
   All 19 voting Democrats on the subcommittee, along with
Republican Reps. Sherwood Boehlert and Guy Molinari, both of New
York, supported the bill which directs Bush to call an emergency
panel. On Tuesday, Bush reiterated his determination to let the
machinists' union and Eastern settle the dispute without federal
action.
   Although the Railway Labor Act gives a panel 30 days to mediate
and imposes an additional 30-day cooling-off period, subcommittee
Chairman Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., indicated he might support a
shorter period for mediating the dispute.
   Oberstar said even if Bush vetoes the measure, it would send the
message that Congress wants the strike settled.
   The bill as passed by the committee also calls on the panel to
mediate Eastern's negotiations with its pilots and flight attendants
even though contract negotiations for them have not reached the same
impasse as the machinists' dispute.
   ``We want to stick it all into the same bag, settle it all at
once,'' said Oberstar.
   In Miami, an Eastern attorney told a federal judge the airline
could not operate more than 48 to 72 hours without pilots. But the
judge refused to compel pilots to return to work.
   Onstad told the congressional panel that if the airline had to
pay the wages it was paying before the strike, that too could
quickly kill Eastern.
   ``I don't think Eastern has the cash to survive two weeks of a
presidential emergency board,'' he said.
   Since the airline began bargaining with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, he said, it has
reduced its demand for $200 million in wage reductions to $125
million. The union wants $50 million in raises.
   Onstad declined to say how much Eastern was losing as a result of
the strike but he said losses totaled $1 million a day before Feb. 1
and had increased since then.
   He said, however, the airline could still continue operations if
its pilots would return to work and agree to a plan that would
increase their productivity by $64 million without cutting wages.
   He said the company could pick up between $190 million and $375
million in revenue from gradual recovery of the business it was
losing and from planned programs to attract new passengers. That, he
said, would be enough to avoid bankruptcy.

<HEAD>With Eastern Weakened, Pan Am Launches `Shuttle War'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am marshaled its ammunition as the Eastern
Airlines strike loomed: More planes. More free coffee. Crates of
laminated luggage tags. Stacks of frequent-flier sign-up forms.
   And when the Machinist union walked, the Shuttle War was on.
   ``This just gives us a golden opportunity to get those Eastern
die-hard passengers,'' Perette Ross, a Pan Am marketing director,
said Tuesday. ``Hopefully they'll become loyalists to the Pan Am
shuttle.''
   ``When Pan Am was struck in 1985 we did the same thing, going for
their routes,'' shrugged Eastern's Joe Scott. ``It's a dog-eat-dog
world.''
   But the dogs were fighting over a particularly big bone this
week: the immensely profitable Boston-New York-Washington shuttle
business, in which Eastern and Pan Am are the only competitors.
   Eastern, after meeting just half its shuttle schedule Saturday
and Sunday and 60 percent Monday, struggled to restore its presence
Tuesday, throwing its strike-diminished work force into the effort.
   ``Fly Us With No Reservations,'' Eastern declared in full-page
newspaper advertisements. Seeking to reassure time-pressed business
travelers, the text pledged: ``Our No. 1 priority is to keep the
shuttle flying.''
   But ridership was low at Eastern, which has operated the shuttle
for 27 years and made about $30 million on the service last year.
Most of Tuesday's flights carried only 15 to 20 passengers,
according to a company source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Pan Am, moving aggressively, reported as much as double its
normal shuttle business. The Pan Am shuttle has grown since its
inception in 1986 to about 5,000 passengers each weekday, or nearly
half the market.
   Since Eastern's strike began Saturday, Pan Am has doubled its
rush hour service, put on a bigger airplane to Boston and
aggressively promoted its frequent-flier program to shuttle
passengers. It has gone so far as to laminate travelers' business
cards into free luggage tags at its terminals.
   Airline analysts gave the effort its due. ``Pan Am has an open
shot at this market right now,'' said Louis Marckesano, a vice
president of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., a Philadelphia brokerage
house.
   ``The hardest thing in any marketing business is to get somebody
to try your product,'' Marckesano said. ``If Pan Am indeed is able
to provide a good product, there's a good chance they'll be able to
keep at least some of the additional traffic they've taken from
Eastern.''
   The problem may not be Eastern's for long: It is selling its
shuttle for $365 million to developer Donald Trump. Bruce Nobles,
president of the Trump Shuttle, said he was ``not the least bit
worried'' about losses to Pan Am.
   ``We're not just taking over the Eastern shuttle. We are starting
a new airline,'' said Nobles. ``So the condition of the Eastern
shuttle at the time we close is really not material.''
   Trump's agreement with Eastern could be canceled in a case of
``material adverse change'' to the property, Nobles said. But no
revenue level or market share was set, he said, adding, ``We are
going to close this deal.''
   Still, some analysts suggested that the strike, if it led to
bankruptcy for Eastern, could endanger the sale. And others simply
said Trump will be buying a tarnished property.
   ``It's just that instead of starting out as Number 1,'' said
Marckesano, ``he may start as Number 2.''

<HEAD>Ex-Labor Official Arrested In Widening Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Authorities today arrested a former government vice
minister on charges he took bribes from a Japanese conglomerate, the
latest bombshell in a widening stock scandal that has tainted the
highest echelons of power.
   The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors' Office arrested Takashi
Kato, 58, the former vice minister of labor and the highest-ranking
public official yet arrested in the scandal.
   Kato was charged with accepting bribes from Recruit Co. in 1986,
when he bought bargain-priced stocks in Recruit-Cosmos Co., a
subsidiary. He allegedly earned about $56,000 in profits when he
later sold the stock after the company went public and share prices
skyrocketed.
   Prosecutors allege that Kato, in return for the stock deal,
influenced a ministry decision on publishing employment information
that would benefit Recruit, an information conglomerate.
   Prosecutors today also arrested Masao Tatsumi, 46, a Recruit
executive, who they claimed conspired with Recruit's founder and
former chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe, in bribing Kato.
   The arrests brought to 12 the number of scandal-related arrests.
Ezoe was apprehended Feb. 13 on bribery charges.
   Two minor Recruit Co. officials were released Tuesday and
prosecutors have yet to decide whether charges will be formally
filed against them.
   Kato's arrest had been widely anticipated since prosecutors last
month arrested Shigeru Kano, a junior officer to Kato, on bribery
charges. Prosecutors today also searched Kato's residence in
Yokohama along with several Recruit branch offices in Tokyo.
   The stock scandal, in which more than 150 politicians, public
officials and business leaders were offered bargain shares in
Recruit-Cosmos and earned handsome profits, has rocked the
administration of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita since last summer.
   Many politicians, including Takeshita and former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been linked to the widening scandal after it
was revealed their aides had purchased thousands of the low-priced
shares.
   Three Cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, have already stepped down after their involvement in the
scandal was revealed.
   Meanwhile, opposition parties stalled deliberations in the Diet,
the Japanese parliament, on the nation's budget and demanded the
Takeshita administration resign en masse or summon Nakasone to the
Diet for questioning on his involvement.
   ``Without Nakasone appearing in the Diet, we cannot participate
in the session,'' said Shun Ohide, an official of the Japan
Socialist Party, the nation's largest opposition group.
   ``You must resign now, Mr. Takeshita,'' said Socialist Party
Chairman Takako Doi at a speech in northern Japan on Tuesday night.
``If you can't resign en masse, you must dissolve the Diet and
appeal to the confidence of the people by calling for an election.''
   Takeshita repeatedly has called for political reform in efforts
to leave the scandal behind, but almost daily developments have
caused the administration's popularity to plunge in media polls.
   The newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported Thursday that of 2,211
adults polled, just 21.3 percent said they supported the Takeshita
administration, down 6.1 percentage points from a similar poll in
January.
   The January poll's findings marked first time below 30 percent
for Takeshita since he became prime minister in November 1987.

<HEAD>Unions Approves Agreement With Los Angeles Herald Examiner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing reporters, truck
drivers and janitors at the Los Angeles Herald Examiner has accepted
by a five-vote margin a contract offer that includes a 14 percent
pay increase over three years.
   The Communications Workers Union voted 164-159 to accept the
contract, and the results were met with cheers and moans when they
were announced at the Hollywood-Roosevelt Hotel.
   Voting occurred Tuesday during a six-hour, closed-door meeting.
   ``We almost had a riot,'' said reporter Deborah Hastings, who
related that the anger was directed at union leadership for reaching
the tentative contract just hours after union members voted to
authorize a strike.
   Graphic Communications Union negotiator David Grabhorn was at
times pelted with dog biscuits, said reporter John Chandler. When
the company's final offer was described to employees, disenchanted
workers urged negotiators to ``throw the bone back.''
   ``It was a zoo,'' Chandler said.
   ``Our mission now is to continue to publish the bright, lively
and reliable newspaper our readers and advertisers have come to
expect,'' said Herald Examiner chief operating executive John J.
McCabe.
   Reporter Alina Tugend said Herald Examiner workers will receive
wage increases of 5 percent effective immediately, 4 percent the
second year of the contract and 5 percent the third year of the
three-year pact. The contract also improved health benefits for
families of employees.
   The union represents about 500 of the paper's 800 union members.
The union had compared the pay scale at the Herald Examiner, a
money-losing operation for several years, to its sister paper in the
Hearst Corp., the San Francisco Examiner.
   Under the old contract, top-scale Herald Examiner reporters
received $563 a week, compared to an $801 weekly salary paid to San
Francisco's top reporters.
   The Herald Examiner's circulation is 235,000.

   Share prices were higher in calm dealings at midday
Wednesday, as shares were boosted from the outset by a buy program.
   Dealers also noted strong buying in futures, which inspired a
good deal of confidence in the overall cash market.
   ``People are obviously prepared to pay a high price because they
believe we're on the way up,'' one dealer said.
   ``The market feels healthy,'' another market maker said.
   ``We've risen for the last six days on some not-so-good news so I
think all we need is one moderately favorable development to kick us
really higher.''
   By about 12:15 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was 4.9 points, or 0.2 percent, higher at 2,088.4, and below
its midmorning best level of 2,092.1. The index began the day at its
2,085.5 low point.
   Volume amounted to a modest 324 million shares by midday,
compared with 357.1 million shares at the same time Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   ``Tired of the nine to five grind? See more of
the world in a month than most people see in a lifetime,'' the
help-wanted ad said.
   The job? Flight attendant at Eastern Airlines.
   Never mind that the nation's seventh-largest airline has
furloughed 9,500 employees, grounded almost all of its flights and
is teetering on the brink of ruin.
   Approximately 20 young men and women showed up at a Washington
hotel on a cold, snowy Tuesday to answer the ad that appeared in
Sunday's Washington Post.
   The Eastern official who did the interviewing, Jeff Bowen,
insisted the ad was not placed in anticipation of the strike that
hit the airline Saturday.
   ``What we are doing is trying to fill the commitment we made in
the newspaper ads, rather than lock the door. We had no idea we
would be faced with this situation,'' Bowen said.
   Members of Local 533 of the Transport Workers Union, which
represents the flight attendants, scoffed at the claim.
   ``They're hiring scab flight attendants to replace us,'' said
Teal Carter, a stewardess with Eastern for five years, as she
picketed outside the hotel.
   Judy Coughlin, secretary-treasurer of the local, said Eastern
conducted similar interviews in Miami on Sunday and Monday and in
Boston on Tuesday and planned to do so in New York today.
   ``We are meeting these people at every hotel,'' Ms. Coughlin
said. ``We have had great success in convincing people to turn away.
We handed them a flier and told them about other airlines that were
hiring flight attendants and would pay them more money, and we said
please come back some day when things are better at Eastern.''
   The pickets drew the support of Local 25 of the Hotel and
Restaurant Employees Union, which represents workers at the
Washington Hilton hotel, where the interviews were held.
   Ron Richardson, executive secretary-treasurer of the local, said
he telephoned William H. Edwards Jr., general manager of the hotel,
Monday night and ``asked him to throw Eastern out of there.''
   ``His response was that they had already rented the place, and
they couldn't legally get out of it, but that it was just that one
morning, and he did not think they would be back,'' Richardson said.
   ``It is strange for a union company to hold a meeting of that
nature in a union hotel,'' said Edwards. ``It was a situation that
they could have avoided. I don't foresee it happening again.''
   Peter Chatilovicz, labor counsel for the Washington Hotel
Association, said he spoke with Eastern's lawyers about the matter
Tuesday.
   The job-seekers, meanwhile, were mostly oblivious to the furor
over Eastern.
   ``I want a job,'' said a young woman who would identify herself
only as Barbara. ``I really didn't know about the controversy that
was going on.''
   She said company interviewers did not talk to her about the union
or tell her that people were being laid off. She also said she was
not given encouragement that she would get a job.
   Dennis Jones, an unemployed Washington resident, said he was not
aware that Eastern had been struck and was furloughing employees. He
said he just wanted to work for an airline.
   ``We are not passing out applications,'' said Bowen. ``We are
just trying to get an idea of those individuals who would be
interested in working for Eastern in the event that we had to do
some replacement of flight attendants.''

<HEAD>Chief of PS Group Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Barkley, the president and chief executive
of PS Group who helped guide Pacific Southwest Airlines through the
deregulation of the airline industry, announced that he will resign
in April.
   ``It's time to give it to another generation,'' Barkley said
Tuesday. ``I had a contract that said I could go home when I was 60.
I will be 60 next month, so I'm going home.''
   PS Group's board of directors named George Shortley as Barkley's
successor. Shortly, 48, joined PSA in 1968 as controller and
currently serves as executive vice president of the firm.
   Barkley will remain a member of the board of directors of PS
Group and chairman of its exeucitve committee.
   PS Group was the parent company of PSA until it sold the San
Diego-based carrier to USAir last year. PS Group then emerged as a
``liquid investment company'' that is building one of the nation's
largest travel networks as well as leasing aircraft and selling fuel
to U.S. airlines.
   Barkley ``quietly led the company and kept it stable during the
deregulation period,'' said Russell Ray, former PSA president who is
now the vice president for commercial marketing for Douglas Aircraft
Co.
   ``I'm happy for the calm, but it certainly isn't the same world''
as the heated days of cut-throat competition in the deregulated
airline industry, Barkley said. ``It was a tough business to be in,
but it was exciting and dramatic.''
   The most difficult year in PSA's history was 1978, the year that
deregulation was announced, he said.
   A collision over San Diego that year involving a PSA jet and a
private plane killed 144 people, including 37 PSA employees.
   Fuel prices began to climb in 1978, prompting PSA to make the
tough choice of buying a new fleet of aircraft for short flights to
replace its gas-guzzling 727s.

   Tortellini, ravioli and manicotti will soon
be added to the cookies, crackers and snacks sold by Keebler Co. if
the proposed buyout of a Toluca-based frozen pasta manufacturer goes
through as planned.
   Keebler has signed a letter of intent to purchase Bernardi
Italian Foods _ a family business which traces its roots to 1932 and
a small restaurant run by the son of Italian immigrants.
   Today, Bernardi employs about 120 people in the production of
about 40 varieties of fresh and frozen pasta which it distributes
nationally and in Canada.
   ``They are going through our books right now and we're supposed
to close the deal in mid-April,'' Jerry Bernardi, chief executive of
the pasta company, said Tuesday.
   Terms of the proposed sale were not disclosed.
   ``But nothing is going to change here,'' Bernardi said. ``It's
going to be business as usual and everything will remain under the
Bernardi label. We will be a subsidiary of Keebler, operated
independently. My son, Dick, and I are even going to continue to run
it.''
   Keebler spokesman Stuart Greenblatt, at company headquarters in
the Chicago suburb of Elmhurst, said the purchase of Bernardi was
tentative and requires the approval of Keebler's parent company,
United Biscuits (Holdings) PLC of London.
   Greenblatt said the acquisition would give Keebler, which ranks
second to Nabisco with $1 billion annual sales of cookies, snacks
and crackers, a foothold in the lucrative and growing pasta food
market.
   ``I wouldn't say we're looking to get into frozen pasta,''
Greenblatt said. ``Bernardi's is a good fit with our current food
service operations. And we have a frozen snack bread product so
we're already into frozen foods.
   ``But this would be our first pasta operation.''
   Bernardi's interest in the pasta business dates back to 1932 when
his father, Nildo ``Mona'' Bernardi, opened a restaurant in Toluca,
a town of 1,500 located about 40 miles north of Peoria.
   Bernardi, 58, joined his father in the restaurant and in 1969, he
bought a machine that automatically makes the family specialty:
tortellini.
   The machine allowed Bernardi to replace five women who produced
about 150 pounds of tortellini each week by hand _ production the
machine could match in one day.
   Bernardi began mass-production of the pasta in an old
meat-packing plant and in 1980 entered the frozen-food business,
marketing his product under his father's nickname ``Mona's.''
   Along with frozen tortellini, Bernardi's menu includes
pre-cooked, filled pastas, such as ravioli and manicotti. Other
items include lasagna and rotini and raw pastas such as egg noodles,
fettuccine and gnocchi.
   The company also sells its own line of entrees with sauces.
   Bernardi originally sold tortellini and other pasta primarily to
area restaurants, school cafeterias and private institutions.
   ``Italian food and pasta has become extremely popular,'' Bernardi
said. ``In the last two years, the growth has been tremendous.''

   When biologist Abigale Alling steps inside
an airlock, she'll begin a stay in what eventually will be a new
world on Earth.
   Starting late today, Ms. Alling is scheduled to live for five
days inside a self-contained environment _ a completely closed
ecosystem independent of the air, water and nutrients of Earth,
which researchers call Biosphere I.
   Her five-day stay in the module is a precursor to a two-year stay
in a larger and more complex version of the airlock, or Biosphere II.
   Project spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr said researchers hope Ms.
Alling's five days in the airlock will have no startling
developments.
   In similar but shorter experiments, ``nothing dramatic happened,
which is exactly what we wanted,'' she said. ``Nothing unusual goes
on, and then that's normal.''
   Ms. Alling, a 29-year-old design coordinator for the Biosphere II
project, will be monitoring and studying the various systems that
control the environment inside the sealed 15,000-cubic-foot
glass-and-steel space-frame structure. Project managers on the
outside will be doing the same.
   Ms. Alling's heart and respiration rate and other vital signs
also will be monitored during her five-day stay.
   ``I will be breathing air that is apart from Earth. Water
recycling will be apart from Earth. This is really a milestone,''
Ms. Alling said.
   The nearly 2.5-acre, 7-million-cubic-foot Biosphere II is under
construction, and in September 1990, eight researchers called
``biospherians'' will be sealed inside for two years.
   The aim will be to see whether man can exist in a complex and
evolving but completely enclosed world. Biosphere II will have seven
separate environmental systems, including a tropical rain forest,
marsh, and desert. About 3,800 plant and animal species are being
selected for the project.
   ``Learning how to do a better job of stewardship of Biosphere
I,'' will be the ``big payoff of Biosphere II,'' said Carl Hodges,
director of the University of Arizona's Environmental Research
Laboratory and a consultant on Biosphere II. Such global problems as
air pollution, acid rain and the greenhouse effect would be some of
the issues studied, he said.
   The $30 million Biosphere II project is being undertaken by Space
Biospheres Ventures, a private company funded largely by Texas
oilman Edward P. Bass.
   There have been 2{ years of unmanned studies and a three-day
manned study in the test module.

   The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
said it would support the Bush administration's so-called fallback
financing plan for insolvent savings and loans.
   Only two weeks ago, directors of the San Francisco bank had
voiced opposition to the plan to offer emergency funds, fearing
insolvent S&amp;L's might not be able to pay back the money.
   But a spokeswoman for the bank said Tuesday that ``directors had
been talking with Washington to get clarification on the plan and
today that clarification was received.''
   The bank said in a brief statement that it ``has agreed to
participate with other Federal Home Loan Banks in the shared lending
program with the Federal Reserve Banks.''
   Under the plan, the U.S. Treasury, the nation's 12 Federal
Reserve banks and the 12 Federal Home Loan banks would make the
loans if there were a run on desposits at insolvent thrifts.

   The stock market was narrowly mixed today as
traders awaited new government figures on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.61 to 2,292.32
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 274 up, 339 down and
414 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.50 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were playing it cautious awaiting the
employment report for February from the Labor Department on Friday.
   Wall Streeters hope the data will show a slowing of economic
growth, providing a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and
a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates.
   But evidence of that kind has been slow in coming for many months
now, leaving many market participants leery of any surprises in the
data.
   Brokers also noted that enthusiasm for stocks seemed to cool a
bit on Tuesday after the Dow Jones industrial average made a run
past the 2,300 level and then fall back.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose [ to 45; American
Express gained \ to 30|, and Boeing fell } to 64|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks stood
at 165.28, unchanged from Tuesday. At the American Stock Exchange,
the market value index was down .34 at 328.49.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.11 to
2,290.71.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
693 up, 736 down and 509 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 172.50 million shares, against 168.88

   Microsoft Corp.'s stock plunged nearly 14
percent in heavy trading after the personal computer software
publisher announced it expects lower sales and profits for its third
quarter, ending March 31.
   The stock sank $8.50 a share to $53.50 Tuesday and was the most
actively traded over-the-counter issue, with more than 5 million
shares changing hands.
   Microsoft blamed the lower forecast on delays in shipments and
overstocking by key distributors.
   ``This came as a nasty surprise. We can't tell how serious it is
yet,'' said James Mendelson, a stock analyst with Morgan Stanley &
Co. in New York.
   Microsoft President Jon Shirley said, ``Customer demand for our
broad range of products remains good,'' and better results are
expected in the final quarter.
   Buck Ferguson, director of administration and investor relations
for Microsoft, said investors overreacted.
   Bill Whitlow, a securities analyst with Dain Bosworth, and Teresa
Lotzgesell, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie Inc., agreed.
   ``None of this is a reflection of the company's position or its
products,'' Whitlow said.
   In heavy over-the-counter trading, Microsoft was off $8 a share
at $54 late in the session, a drop of nearly 13 percent.
   In a news release, Microsoft predicted third-quarter sales of
$180 million to $200 million, down from the $200 million to $215
million expected by many market analysts.
   Microsoft had sales of $161.8 million for the third quarter of
last year and profits of $37.3 million. The company said it expected
profits for the current quarter ``to be somewhat less than a year
ago.'
   Shipments of Microsoft's new versions of its word-processing
program, Microsoft Word 4.0 for Apple Macintosh and Word 5.0 for
IBM-compatible computers, were delayed and strong demand caused the
company to run out of stock for current versions of both, Microsoft
said. It said the new versions should be shipped next month.
   Overstocked distributors are reducing their inventories, and
demand for other Microsoft products remains good, said Microsoft
President Jon Shirley. ``The shipping of both new Microsoft Word
versions and the inventory reductions will improve our results in
the next quarter,'' he said.

<HEAD>Affidavit Details Extortion Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An affidavit filed in a case stemming
from a $10 million attempted extortion of the Du Pont Co. shows
stolen documents detailed company secrets for its spandex fiber.
   In the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court, FBI Special Agent
Charles Flagg said the documents ranged from ``blueprints for the
construction of the Du Pont Lycra manufacturing plants'' to the
company's specific process for manufacturing the spandex fiber,
``including mixtures, formulas, pressures, operating temperatures,
plant maintenance and all necessary related technology.''
   In the affidavit, Salim M. Ibrahim of Geneva, Switzerland, who
directs Du Pont's worldwide Lycra business and helped develop the
spandex fiber process, told Flagg, ``a knowledgeable individual or
chemical company would be in a position to duplicate the Lycra
manufacturing process'' if they had access to the documents.
   Lycra is primarily used in swimming suits, sportswear and
stockings.
   Four former employees at the Du Pont Lycra manufacturing plant in
Mercedes, Argentina, were arrested Feb. 28 in Geneva after an
aborted meeting at which they were to pick up the $10 million in
exchange for more than 1,000 documents stolen from the plant.
   A fifth suspect, also a former employee, remained at large
Tuesday.
   All are charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to
extort, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Edmond Falgowski.
   If the suspects fight extradition, it could take up to two months
to have them returned to the United States, Falgowski said, adding,
if they waive extradition, they could be in Delaware in about a week.
   The affidavit alleges Isaac Assa, a Mexican citizen who
manufactures spandex in Mexico City, hired Bruno Skerianz, who in
turn enticed three employees of the Argentina plant to work for him.
   Skerianz, who worked for Du Pont 20 years ago, was among the
Argentine nationals arrested last week.
   Raul Armando Giordano, 36, former superintendent of Lycra
operations, and Antonio Ruben Inigo, 39, former maintenance
supervisor of Lycra production at the plant, were allegedly
recruited by Skerianz and arrested last month.
   Maria Ines Lorenzo de Bianchini, 39, former custodian of the
technical records at the plant with access to the documents, was
also arrested. The affidavit says she was drawn into the scheme by
Inigo, who allegedly was her lover.
   Jose Maria Peterosino, 44, a former engineer on the Lycra
production line, remains at large. He too, was allegedly recruited
by Skerianz.
   The affidavit says Assa's first contact with Du Pont came in a
meeting Nov. 10 and a second meeting the following day at company
headquarters in Wilmington with Ibrahim and Paul G. Gillease, who
directs Du Pont's textile fibers division.
   Assa told them he had hired Skerianz to gather technical
information about spandex to make his company more competitive and
that Skerianz had Du Pont secrets. Assa said Skerianz was
negotiating to sell the information to the Italian fiber maker
Ridici, the affidavit says.
   Skerianz met in December in Wilmington with Ibrahim and Gillease,
demanding $10 million for the documents and promising the former
employees would not open a competing spandex operation for five
years, the affidavit says.
   Skerianz met again with Ibrahim and Gillease in Wilmington on
Jan. 9. The Du Pont executives were accompanied by an undercover FBI
agent, the affidavit says.
   After examining the documents Jan. 27 in Milan, Italy, Gillease
called Skerianz to agree to the $10 million payment.

   Another McDonald's is opening for business today
but this one has the bragging rights of being the biggest in Texas
where customers can munch on a Big Mac and fries.
   What also sets this 10,000-square-foot, two-story restaurant
apart from others is that patrons can monitor the New York Stock
Exchange on an electronic ticker at the restaurant, receive
telephone calls at their tables or fax their orders to pick-up
through a double drive-thru.
   ``We're anticipating to do big business at this restaurant and we
have every reason to believe it'll be the most successful ever
opened,'' said Brenda Duncan, senior marketing manager for
McDonald's Corp., which owns and operates the new 156-seat
restaurant in the Galleria business center.
   The hamburger palace is the first fast-food restaurant in the
predominantly business area and was opened with the businessman's
needs in mind, Ms. Duncan said.
   ``We're always looking into innovative ways to fill the needs of
our customers and this is just one of those ways at the Galleria,''
she said.
   A McDonald's on New York's Wall Street has a ticker tape and a
Los Angeles restaurant has telephones at tables, but the new
Galleria restaurant is the only one to incorporate all the
amenities, including the facsimile machine.
   What patrons will find at the new restaurant is an upscale
interior of teal blue, mauve, gray, silver and black with marble
accents instead of the bright red and yellow found at the other 134
McDonald's restaurants in Houston.
   ``We are targeting the business people that work there by putting
amenities in the store that appeal to them _ the ticker tape and
telephones at selected tables. This way the businessman can continue
to do work and eat their favorite McDonald's meal,'' she said.
   Aside from the usual menu of Big Macs and fries, the restaurant
also will offer fruit-filled breakfast tortes, soup of the day,
freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and a low-calorie whipped
dessert.
   The new restaurant ``represents McDonald's largest investment in
the state of Texas and it shows how we feel about Houston. There's
confidence here that Houston is rebounding,'' she said.
   Despite the bragging rights as the biggest McDonald's restaurant
in the state, the new restaurant will be minus a huge ``Golden
Arches'' sign.
   McDonald's officials originally wanted to place the sign on a
42-foot pole near the building to attract motorists from nearby
Interstate Loop 610, but the hamburger chain yielded to pressure
from area businessmen who complained the sign was too big.
   And although the restaurant is the biggest McDonald's in Texas,
it's just a small fry when compared with the chain's largest outlet
_ a 26,000-square-foot restaurant in Vinita, Okla., that spans the
Will Rogers Turnpike.

<HEAD>Sale Of Coleco Explored</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleco Industries Inc.'s board of directors has
authorized management to explore a sale of the toy company as a
means of solving its financial problems, but no potential purchasers
have been identified.
   J. Brian Clarke, president and chief executive officer of the
Avon, Conn.-based company, said the board took the action two weeks
ago. The committee representing Coleco's creditors in its bankruptcy
case has also approved exploring a sale, Clarke said Tuesday.
   Morton E. Handel, Coleco's chairman, said no purchase offers have
been received. He wouldn't say whether any talks with interested
bidders have been held.
   Testifying in U.S. District Court in New York on Tuesday, Clarke
said selling the company is an alternative to proceeding with the
debt repayment plan Coleco has proposed.
   Coleco, which filed in January for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, has proposed a plan for
repaying some of its $540.3 million in debts. The creditors'
committee is fighting the plan, saying it would give most creditors
only 10 cents of every $1 Coleco owes them.
   U.S. District Judge Prudence B. Abram put off a decision until
April 4 on Coleco's request for approval of the plan's disclosure
statement, which explains how much the company is proposing to pay
each group of creditors.
   Abram's approval is needed before the plan can be sent to
creditors for a vote, which is necessary before Coleco can emerge
from bankruptcy protection.
   Abram, saying Coleco shouldn't be surprised that most creditors
object so strongly to its plan, reminded those in the courtroom of a
popular 1960s song called ``Wipe Out.''
   ``That's exactly what the unsecured creditors perceive the plan
offers them,'' the judge said. ``I can't think of another plan where
I've seen the unsecured creditors so wholly wiped out as they are in
this case.''
   Many of those unsecured creditors are investors who own about
$335 million in Coleco bonds.
   The creditors' committee on Feb. 14 filed a lawsuit against Isaac
Perlmutter and Bernard Marden, New York financiers who are the only
secured Coleco creditors, meaning they are first in line for
repayment.
   Coleco's reorganization plan proposes that Perlmutter and Marden
be repaid with stock and cash worth $70 million of the $80 million
they are owed, effectively giving them control of Coleco.
   The lawsuit questions business dealings the two had with Coleco
in the past two years and claims the men owe the company $71 million.

   Amoco Corp. did something that Michelangelo
didn't, and the oil company could wind up paying some $80 million
for its artistic blunder.
   Amoco used white Italian marble sheathing on the outside surface
of its 80-story headquarters building in downtown Chicago. But the
marble has weakened over the years.
   So all 43,000 of them will be replaced with granite during a
facelift that begins next month.
   ``Carrara marble, which is what's on the building, is
beautiful,'' says Chicago architect Walter Netsch. ``Michelangelo
used it. But Michelangelo didn't leave his work outside.''
   The repair job could cost up to $80 million before its completion
in three years, said Shelby C. Pierce, manager of engineering for
Amoco.
   Stainless steel strapping was installed last year to hold the
350-pound marble panels in place, even though the clips that attach
the slabs to the building have never failed, a company spokesman
said.
   In late 1973, a winter storm caused a construction scaffold to
hit a slab that fell and demolished a car, said the spokesman Mike
Thompson. But he said that was before the building opened in 1975,
and no pieces have fallen since.
   ``We decided to bite the bullet rather than continue forever on a
maintenance program,'' Pierce said Monday of the replacement
project. `We decided to get it over with.''
   The replacement granite has a salt-and-pepper look up close, but
will be whiter than the marble when viewed from afar, he said.
   At 1,136 feet, the structure was the fourth tallest in the world
when it was completed. It's still the tallest marble-faced building
anywhere.
   The marble was hauled from near Carrara in north central Italy at
the direction of John Swearingen, then company chairman, and his
socially prominent wife, Bonnie.
   Now the company says it was a blunder to use the marble, which
has badly deteriorated over the past two decades.
   ``Tests show conclusively that many of the marble panels have
lost strength and must utimately be replaced,'' said Pierce.
   The old marble cannot be reused in building construction and no
decision has been made as to what to do with it once it's removed
from the building.
   It's too weak for buildings and too warped for countertops. Until
a buyer is found, the marble will be piled up outside the
headquarters, said Pierce.
   The granite comes from a quarry in Mt. Airy, N.C., which is one
of the world's largest suppliers of gravestones.
   ``This granite is very strong and stable,'' said Pierce. ``I
wanted to make sure that 15 years from now someone doesn't have to
go through what I'm going through.''

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher told
Congress today that private industry, and not the government, must
take the lead in developing high-definition television production in
this country.
   Mosbacher said HDTV sales in this country could reach $140
billion in the next 20 years and that the impact of HDTV will go far
beyond entertainment uses. He cited potential advances in education,
retailing and the military and said the United States must take a
leading role in this developing industry.
   But the private sector should remain ``pre-eminent'' in this
effort, he said, and any U.S. funds that are expended for research
in HDTV should go to the domestic industry and not to foreign
competitors.
   ``In my view the private sector must take the lead...and we're
the ones who will be getting the hindrances out of the way,'' he
said.
   He suggested the government role could include tax incentives and
possible antitrust exemptions for U.S. manufacturers of HDTV
products. He said development of a government policy in this regard
has the ``highest priority'' at the Commerce Department and that he
expects to be able to make a recommendation to Congress on the
government role in the next two months.
   A private study released Tuesday said the United States must move
aggressively into the new high-definition television and flat-screen
display industries or lose more than 2 million jobs annually and
suffer a $225 billion trade deficit in electronics by the year 2010.
   If the United States does not compete effectively with the
Japanese and other nations in the high-technology arena, the
personal computer and semiconductor industries alone could have
respective deficits of $114 billion and $76 billion early in the
next century, the report from the Economic Policy Institute said.
   Its author, Robert Cohen, said: ``Our nation stands at a critical
juncture. If we do not create a strong industrial base centered on
development of HDTV and flat-display screen technology, it will not
only weaken our industrial base, but also reduce the numbers of
skilled jobs that are needed to make us more competitive.''
   Proponents of HDTV claim it can provide motion picture-quality
images on flat television or computer screens using digital
components.
   Japan expects to have an HDTV system in full operation by the
mid-1990s, whereas the U.S. telecommunications industry has barely
begun testing of HDTV technology.
   The U.S. Defense Department is soliciting bids for companies to
share in a $30 million HDTV research and development program.
   Cohen said HDTV technology will improve the entire ``food chain''
in the electronics industry.
   ``HDTVs will be used in the home, as display screens for personal
computers, and by the nation's businesses to improve controls over
automated production in auto, steel and manufacturing plants, to
integrate video and print media in newspapers, and for the
collection and transmission of important medical results such as
X-rays and computer tomographs,'' Cohen said.
   He said he based his study on findings recently released by the
American Electronics Association. According to the AEA study, a
``strong'' scenario represents a case in which 50 percent of the
U.S. market for HDTV is controlled by U.S. companies. In a ``weak''
scenario only 10 percent of the U.S. market would be controlled by
U.S. concerns.
   Cohen said that with a strong HDTV base the U.S. personal
computer industry would attain an estimated $176 billion in sales by
2010, in contrast to an expected $44 billion in sales with a weak
HDTV sector.
   In the semiconductor industry, sales would be $99 billion in a
strong U.S. HDTV industry compared with $25 billion in a weak
industry.
   The trade imbalance in electronics could range from an estimated
surplus of $10 billion under a strong HDTV program to a $227 billion
deficit with a weak HDTV program, Cohen said.
   In the employment area, the personal computer industry could have
588,000 employees in 2010 under a strong HDTV scenario, or 147,000
employees under a weak HDTV program, he said.
   In all related industries, including HDTV receivers and VCRs,
automated manufacturing equipment, personal computers and
semiconductors, there could be nearly 1.1 million jobs under a
strong scenario and 274,000 jobs under a weak program.
   Cohen said spinoff employment from a strong HDTV program could
create another 1.1 million jobs _ even more if flat-screen display
technology is used extensively in retailing, education or in
automobile assembly.
   The Economic Policy Institute is a labor-backed think tank based
in Washington.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were trading
mostly lower this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
slack demand and forecasts for milder weather in the Midwest and
Great Plains.
   Pressure on the soybean market also stemmed from lower cash
prices domestically and lower values for soybean meal and oil on
overseas markets. But analysts said losses in the soybean oil market
were limited by perceptions that Morocco and Pakistan may be in the
market for U.S. soybean oil.
   The corn and wheat markets also declined amid slow export demand
despite rumors of new Chinese or Soviet buying interest in wheat.
   An expected warm-up to springlike conditions in the nation's
midsection also weighed on grain futures by reminding traders that
spring planting and increased barge shipping are not far away.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.33 a bushel; corn was \ cent to
1} cents lower with March at $2.76{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower
across the board with May at $2.13} a bushel; soybeans were { cent

<HEAD>Pepsi Changes Plans To Run Madonna Ad On MTV</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsi-Cola Co. changed its plans to run its new
two-minute commercial with pop star Madonna on MTV last weekend
after the cable network started running the singer's potentially
controversial new music video, a source close to the soft drink
maker confirmed Wednesday.
   The Pepsi ad with Madonna, which was dubbed ``Make a Wish'' and
included an abbreviated verision of her new song ``Like a Prayer,''
debuted last Thursday on what Pepsi said were top-rated television
shows in 40 countries.
   The next day, the cable network MTV began running a separate
music video designed to herald the launch of the singer's new song.
   The video shows Madonna in a black slip, dancing among burning
crosses and seeking refuge in a church where she kisses a statue of
a saint who comes to life.
   Pepsi had planned to run the two-minute ad last weekend on MTV,
but withheld it while the video is running, according to the source
who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   The source said the change in plans was motivated by a desire to
avoid competing for attention with the video and not by worries
about the controversy that could be stirred by the video.
   Carole Robinson, a spokeswoman for MTV, said the network has
received no complaints about the video, which has been running since
last Friday.
   Liz Rosenberg, a spokesman for Warner Brothers Records, Madonna's
record label, said the record company had received no complaints
here about the video.
   She said a state-run television network in Italy delayed its
plans to carry the video last weekend after a Catholic group
objected to what it had heard may be in the video. But she said the
network has since reviewed the video and plans to begin airing it
within the next 10 days.
   Tod MacKenzie, a spokesman for Pepsi, declined to comment on
whether the Pepsi ad was withdrawn from MTV but said the company had
not changed its overall ad campaign plans.
   He said those plans were to air the two-minute version of the
commercial before the song was released and then air shorter
versions of the two-minute ad after the singer's record had begun to
rise on the record charts.
   The single of Madonna's song was released earlier this week, and
the album is due out later this month.
   MacKenzie said he could not say when the shorter ads will begin
appearing.

   Some of America's largest electronics concerns,
and some of their biggest foreign competitors, have filed
applications for start-up money from the Defense Department to
develop high-definition television technology, the Pentagon
announced today.
   All told, 87 proposals for funding were properly filed before the
Feb. 27 deadline and will be evaluated over the next few months, the
Pentagon said.
   ``We are gratified by the extremely strong response from
industry,'' said Craig I. Fields, the deputy director for research
of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.
   ``Many of the proposals are of impressive quality and they demand
a careful evaluation,'' he said.
   The Pentagon said the first contract grants could be awarded as
early as April. Roughly $30 million in government grants is being
set aside for the research effort.
   Despite some scattered congressional and industry opposition, the
Pentagon announced in January it would not bar foreign-owned
companies from submitting requests for research funding.
   The department cited federal procurement rules that call for fair
and open competition, and the fact that it is too early to assume
that all of the necessary research andt to stay
on the ground, but in this modern age that is impractical for many.
...
   The questions that must be asked and answered now are these:
Should airlines be forced to retire their old ... airliners when
they reach a certain age, rather than continue to repair them? What
should be the criterion for an airliner's retirement? And does the
aviation industry react quickly enough to correct the problems of
aging aircraft once they become known?
   For years, the industry has argued that age alone is no reason to
ground a plane permanently, provided it is properly inspected and
maintained. But now ... airline engineers are correctly having
second throughts. ...
   The awful reality is that the FAA's tardiness actively
contributes to the fear _ not to say the danger _ of airline
travelers already alarmed by these midair calamities involving older
aircraft.
   That has to change, and change quickly, before more lives are
sacrificed to the truly worrisome combination of ignorance and
procastination.

   Bangor (Maine) Daily News on John Tower:
   The controversy over the John Tower confirmation has been
stripped of all pretense that it is driven by lofty motives.
   It is a power play by Senate Democrats, and it deserves a tough
response from President Bush, who should take his case for Tower to
the American people.
   On Monday, the president made his strongest pitch yet for Tower,
taking off one of his gloves at a Washington speech before the
Veterans of Foreign Wars to warn that he is ``sick and tired of the
rumors and innuendos'' that have proved such an obstacle to his
appointee.
   Although such spunk ... is refreshing ... it clearly is time for
the president to go beyond such a limited audience, take off the
other glove and sell the public on his extreme unhappiness with the
Senate confirmation process.

   Amarillo (Texas) Daily News on speaking fees for members of
Congress:
   Many panic-stricken members of Congress who voted down a 51
percent raise now seem to think they no longer are obliged to ban
the acceptance of hefty speaking fees paid to them by lobbying
organizations.
   They are dead wrong, from an ethical as well as a political
standpoint.
   One of the reasons for the huge proposed pay increase was to make
it more palatable for lawmakers to stop padding their individual
salaries with tens of thousands of dollars supplied to them by
interest groups in the form of speaking fees.
   Such payments _ totaling more than $10 million a year _ are an
insidious form of legalized bribery and congressional leaders
acknowledged as much when they intiated steps to abolish speaking
fees in exchange for the raise. ...
   The chairman of President Bush's new Commission on Federal Ethics
Law Reform, retired federal judge Malcolm R. Wilkey, reflects the
unsparing view of most voters: ``The practice (of speaking fees) is
evil.''
   Joining a host of other ethics-minded groups, the presidential
panel has unanimously recommended that speaking fees and other
outside payments from special interests be abolished, irrespective
of the question of a congressional raise.
   This is the only step that will quell the voters' justifiable
wrath.

<HEAD>Sponsor of Connecticut Ad Tax Proposal Rates Its Chances as Slim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDD EVERHART</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief sponsor of a bill that would
impose the state's 7.5 percent sales tax on advertising says it has
little chance of becoming law.
   But Sen. William A. DiBella said he wants to keep all options
open with the state facing huge deficits.
   ``There wasn't much support for it, was there?'' DiBella,
D-Hartford, joked after a day-long hearing on the issue Tuesday.
   The proposal is not being given serious consideration as
Democrats look for hundreds of millions of dollars to erase this
year's deficit and balance next year's budget.
   DiBella, co-chairman of the tax-writing Finance Committee,
estimates that such a levy would produce $120 million a year for the
state.
   DiBella rejected arguments that the tax would hurt the economy,
saying it would simply be passed on to customers in the form of
higher prices for products, as most other taxes are.
   Under his proposal, newspapers, television stations and others
accepting advertisements would collect the taxes from advertisers
and pass them along to the state.
   Connecticut faces a $195 million deficit in the current year, and
Democrat Gov. William A. O'Neill has called for $737 million in new
taxes to balance the 1989-90 budget taking effect July 1.
   O'Neill's tax package didn't include the advertising tax, but he
said again Tuesday that he is willing to look at any proposal.
   If the tax is enacted, it would be the only one in the country.
Florida imposed an advertising tax in 1987, but it was repealed
later that year after a storm of protest from retailers and the
media. The Florida experience was repeatedly mentioned during
Tuesday's hearing.
   The committee heard hours of testimony from scores of people on
the proposal, and not one favored it. A committee vote on the
proposal could come as early as Thursday.
   Most of those testifying said it would be self defeating and cost
Connecticut jobs. They also said it would be difficult to administer
and collect and would hurt new businesses competing for customers.
   Michael Fisch, a vice president of The Hartford Courant speaking
on behalf of the 21-member Connecticut Daily Newspaper Association,
told the committee that ``advertising is the spark plug of the
economy.''
   Susan Weiner, senior vice president for advertising for the May
stores, including G. Fox, Caldor, Lord &amp; Taylor and Filene's, said a
tax on advertising ``will depress advertising and related sales and
will result in a decrease in sales tax revenues.
   Warren Gould of the painters union in New Haven, whose members
paint billboards, said the tax would almost certainly result in
layoffs.
   Typical of the media opponents was William J. Pape II, editor and
publisher of the Waterbury Republican and American.
   ``A tax on advertising would seriously and adversely affect the
Waterbury newspapers, the retailers and businesses which rely on us
to present their merchandise and services to the public, and the
public itself, which would receive a diminished amount of
information on which to base its buying decisions,'' Pape said.
   ``Inevitably, sales tax receipts of the state will be reduced,''
he said.

<HEAD>Radioactive Leakage Formed Underground Pools, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three buildings at the Fernald uranium
processing plant stand over previously undisclosed radioactive
ponds, which may pose a threat to drinking water supplies, a
newspaper reported today.
   Officials of Westinghouse Materials of Ohio, which has operated
the Feed Materials Production Center for the U.S. Department of
Energy since 1985, said efforts to address the problem have already
begun.
   Plant memorandums from 1965 through 1968 indicate that up to five
gallons a minute of uranium-bearing water mixed with nitric acid ate
through brick flooring and drain systems of Fernald's Plants 2 and 3
and the Pilot Plant, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.
   The underground pools discovered beneath the three plants add to
the problems of a production center already plagued by a
25,000-gallon radioactive pool under Plant 6 and six toxic and
radioactive waste storage pits.
   The memos describing the leakage were discovered among thousands
given by the Energy Department to attorneys involved in a $300
million class-action lawsuit neighbors filed against Fernald.
   Graham Mitchell, Fernald team manager for the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency, said the information was not surprising.
   ``We've had general knowledge that the refinery (Plants 2 and 3)
dealt with many more liquids than Plant 6 did,'' he said. ``Plant 6
was kind of a surprise, because it didn't deal with many chemicals,
so we had the feeling it wasn't the only one.''
   The danger of the underground pools is that the radioactivity
could seep into drinking water supplies, Mitchell said. But James
Reafsnyder, the Energy Department's site manager at Fernald, said
clay under the plant seems to have confined the contamination.
   He said there is a plan to drill wells to assess the
environmental risk.
   Fernald, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, processes uranium for
the federal government's nuclear weapons program.
   Energy Department officials have refused to close the 1,050-acre,
37-year-old plant, saying its operations do not endanger residents
or the environment. But the department has begun a 10-year, $500
million cleanup and modernization effort.
   The plant is one of 16 nationally that produce nuclear materials
for the Department of Energy. Several other plants are in various
states of shutdown while health and safety problems are investigated.

   The stock market headed higher today as traders
awaited new government figures on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.83 to 2,300.54 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 657 up, 563 down and
577 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were playing it cautious awaiting the
employment report for February from the Labor Department on Friday.
   Wall Streeters hope the data will show a slowing of economic
growth, providing a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and
a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates.
   But evidence of that kind has been slow in coming for many months
now, leaving many market participants leery of any surprises in the
data.
   Brokers also noted that enthusiasm for stocks seemed to cool a
bit on Tuesday after the Dow Jones industrial average made a run
past the 2,300 level and then fall back.
   Time Inc. slipped { to 116\ after jumping 9\ points on Tuesday.
The big gain was attributed to speculation that the company, in
reaching its weekend agreement to merge with Warner Communications,
might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from some other
direction.
   But some analysts quoted in press reports today said they were
skeptical that that would happen.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Express, up { at
30~; International Business Machines, up ] at 120\; Ford Motor, up [
at 51[, and Philip Morris, up 2 at 113|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.41 to 165.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .02 at 328.85.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.44 million shares at noontime,
down from 83.40 million at the same point Tuesday.

   Three members of a prominent Chicago Mercantile
Exchange broker group and another floor trader have been fined a
total of $400,000 and suspended for up to one month following
allegations of violating Merc rules, according to their lawyer.
   The Merc charged that the brokers prearranged trades to
circumvent limits on trades among members of the same broker group.
The violations occurred in the pit where futures contracts are
traded on Eurodollars, attorney Jeffrey Cole said today.
   Richard Lowrance, who resigned from the exchange's board of
governors last month, was fined $200,000 and suspended for 30 days,
Cole said. Lowrance stepped down before an appearance before the
Merc disciplinary committee in the case.
   David Rothner received a $75,000 fine and a 10-day suspension.
Patrick Maloney was fined $25,000 and barred from trading for five
days. Floor trader Brian Elliott, who was accused of serving an an
intermediary in the violations, was fined $100,000 and suspended 30
days, according to Cole.
   The penalties were imposed in an agreement reached late Tuesday
under which the brokers neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
   Broker groups are teams of floor traders who fill public orders.
They are legal, but have come under scrutiny by an FBI investigation
into suspected fraudulent trading at the Merc and Cgation, he said.
   ``There is no doubt the fines were as high as they were because
of the climate in which traders currently find themselves because of
the federal investigation,'' Cole said.
   Last June, Maloney was fined $1,000 for exceeding limitations on
customer order filling in Eurodollar futures. Rothner was fined
$1,000 for a similar violation in Eurodollar contracts in April 1988.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers for striking Eastern Airlines machinists
argued today that a federal judge improperly barred railroad workers
from honoring picket lines that could close down Amtrak and New
York's commuter railroads.
   The order by U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson ``violated
the clear command of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,'' Joseph Guerrieri
Jr., lawyer for the machinists, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
   That law says federal courts cannot issue injunctions in labor
disputes, except in cross-industry secondary strikes.
   Patterson ``was wrong in enjoining unions from engaging in
secondary boycotts,'' said Guerrieri. ``The unions are free to
engage in a full range of secondary activities.''
   Patterson on Tuesday extended until midnight Friday his temporary
orders barring strikes at Amtrak and New York's commuter railroads
in sympathy with the Eastern Airlines walkout. He scheduled a
hearing for today on whether to issue a long-term ban on sympathy
strikes.
   An aide said the judge extended his temporary orders _ which
would have expired at 3 p.m. today _ to allow himself time to rule.
   Before Patterson's hearing, the appeals court heard an appeal by
the International Association of Machinists and the Brotherhood of
Railroad Signalmen of his temporary order.
   The IAM has said it may set up picket lines at the railroads, and
rail workers' unions have said they would honor such lines. That
could severely disrupt rail transit.
   The unions asked the appeals court to consolidate the three
lawsuits brought by the various railroads into one case and delay
Patterson's restraining order or order him to throw it out.
   But Bernard M. Plum, a lawyer for Metro-North Commuter Railroad
and the Long Island Rail Road, argued that their employees are
required to honor their labor contract until they have exhausted all
non-court remedies under federal railroad laws.
   ``Those contracts require people to come to work every day.
That's a basic obligation,'' said Plum.
   Plum said that under the Railway Labor Act, ``The question is
that they first had to go to (those procedures) before it was
determined if they could honor picket lines.''
   Appeals court Judge Irving R. Kaufman noted, ``Whatever we do,
really, is meanigless because you're going to right to the Supreme
Court _ either side _ won't they?''
   Plum conceded the parties probably would ``given what is at
stake.''
   The appeals panel, which included judges George C. Pratt and
Richard J. Cardamone as well as Kaufman, said it would issue a
decision later today.
   Amtrak, the LIRR, Metro-North and New Jersey Transit sought and
won the temporary orders from Patterson forbidding walkouts.

<HEAD>Witnesses Call for Changes in Crop Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLIOTT MINOR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Richard Ray, a witness at the first
of 15 hearings on the federal crop insurance program, said the
program is wasteful and fails to provide farmers with fair and
equitable protection.
   ``Our country is in tough times right now,'' the congressman said
Tuesday. ``We're looking for a decade of economic stagnation. Our
debt of $2.8 trillion and our interest payments ... have gotten us
in such a situation that we must not waste dollars. The bureaucratic
way in which the federal crop insurance group was put together
causes us to waste a lot of federal dollars. We need to refine
that.''
   Ray, a Democrat who represents Georgia's largely rural 3rd
District, was among 27 witnesses who lined up to testify before the
Commission for the Improvement of the Federal Crop Insurance
Program. The 25-member commission, created by Congress to protect
more farmers from droughts and other disasters, will hold hearings
in 14 states.
   Ray noted that crop insurance reform has the backing of key
Georgia lawmakers, including Sens. Sam Nunn and Wyche Fowler, and
said he is optimistic such legislation could win congressional
approval.
   Kellye Eversole, the commission's executive director, said 50
crops, including peanuts, tobacco, soybeans and peaches, are
eligible for crop insurance. Growers can select policies that cover
50 percent, 65 percent or 75 percent of their average yields.
   Ms. Eversole said concern about the nation's record budget
deficit could mean farmers will have to rely more heavily on crop
insurance, rather than disaster payments.
   ``We're trying to find out what is wrong with the crop insurance
program and why participation is so low,'' she said, noting just 17
percent to 27 percent of the nation's farmers opt for crop coverage.
   Wilbur Gamble, chairman of the Georgia Peanut Commission, said
the two chief objections of Georgia's 10,500 peanut growers is that
crop insurance penalizes growers who have had low yields because of
disasters and forces growers to insure all of their crops, rather
than acreage that faces the greatest risk.
   ``The risks in farming are great, and government rules and
regulations are constantly changing,'' he said. ``These factors have
led to higher costs of production and low prices. We believe it is
extremely important to ... help farmers bear the unpredictable risks
of farming.''
   Johnny Deal, a vice president of the Sea Island Bank in
Statesboro, said his bank requires borrowers to have crop insurance
on at least some of their crops.
   ``In many instances we will have insurance only on peanuts or in
some cases tobacco,'' he said. ``Only a small percentage of our
farmers carry federal crop insurance on corn, wheat, soybeans or
cotton. Their reasoning is that the premium is too high for the
dollar amount of coverage they receive.''
   Another banker, Sam Way, president of the Planters Bank in
Hawkinsville, said banks may decide to grant fewer agricultural
loans unless the crop insurance program is improved.

<HEAD>Japanese Spend Record $16.54 Billion On U.S. Property In '88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese investment in U.S. real estate rose
nearly a third last year with California attracting more investment
than any other state and Los Angeles more than any other city, a
study says.
   Japanese investors spent a record $16.54 billion on U.S. real
estate in 1988, up from $12.77 billion in 1977, to boost their
holdings to a total of $42.88 billion, according to the study by
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., an accounting firm.
   California ranked first among the states with $5.62 billion in
Japanese investments in 1988, followed by New York at $2.8 billion
and Illinois at $1.87 billion, according to the study, released
Tuesday.
   Los Angeles topped all cities with $3.05 billion, with New York
City in second at $2.8 billion, according to the study.
   Among the major Japanese investments in Los Angeles were the
former Wells Fargo office building for $147 million, the Century
City Marriott for $85 million and a 49 percent interest in the
Riviera Country Club.
   The Leventhal figures were more than double the 1988 Japanese
investment total of $7.1 billion reported last week by Salomon
Brothers Inc., New York investment bank.
   But Salomon Brothers analyst Susan R. Jordan said its estimates
were lower because the firm does not include projects under
construction, as does Leventhal.

by a lack of incentive to trade ahead of Britain's budget next week.
   The slowness reflected little movement in the pound and in
British government bonds, which had the effect of leaving the market

<HEAD>Norway's Economic Cure Working Despite Side Effects, Bank Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Norwegian state bank said Wednesday the
country's economic health appears to be improving following tough
government measures but that rising unemployment is a
worse-than-expected side effect.
   ``There has been signficant progress,'' Norges Bank said in its
quarterly report Wednesday.
   The central bank praised recent negotiated and legislated wage
limits but said unemployment, which doubled in one year to 3.9
percent in February, was higher than expected. Another 2 percent of
the jobless were employed in extraordinary government programs.
   ``There is no simple way to reduce unemployment, but it is vital
that the measures used do not undermine efforts to turn the
Norwegian economy around,'' said the report.
   Central Bank President Hermod Skaanland said he did not foresee a
prompt decline in unemployment but that state intervention will
probably not overstimulate domestic demand.
   Income from Norway's North Sea oil fields, now pumping 1.44
million barrels per day, plummeted with the 1986 oil price collapse,
at the peak of a domestic spending and borrowing spree.
   Such earlier measures as interest rate hikes and legislated wage
limits, now extended to March 31, 1990, helped turn Norway's trade
deficit into a January surplus of 3.7 billion kroner, or $552
million, and reduce 1988 consumer spending by 1.6 percent.

   The chairman of the House Banking Committee
today rejected suggestions from the savings and loan industry that
banks be forced to help pay for the S&amp;L crisis.
   S&amp;L lobbyists are urging Congress to combine the separate
insurance funds for commercial banks and savings institutions.
President Bush, under his plan to revitalize the industry, would
maintain separate funds administered by one agency.
   ``I believe one drowning man is enough,'' Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, told reporters.
   Industry representatives also received little sympathy Tuesday
from either Senate Banking Committee members or from representatives
of banking groups.
   Bush would increase the deposit insurance premiums paid by
savings and loans and force their owners to invest more of their own
money, or capital, within two years.
   Barney R. Beeksma, president of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, the largest S&amp;L trade group, told the Senate committee
that the Bush plan, by burdening healthy S&amp;Ls, means ``less mortgage
money will be available and housing will be denied to millions of
households.''
   ``We seek to make our contribution at a level that will not be so
burdensome as to weaken our institutions and thus exacerbate further
the current ... crisis,'' Beeksma said.
   ``The lynch-mob mentality is rampant today, unjustly threatening
the innocent majority (of S&amp;Ls) along with the handful of
scoundrels,'' he said.
   Both Beeksma and Bud Koch, president of the National Council of
Savings Institutions, asked senators to phase in the stricter
capital standards over five years, instead of two, arguing that most
institutions could meet the standard over time.
   ``The current timetable ... is totally unrealistic,'' Koch said.
   Mary-Liz Meany, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers
Association, called the league's proposal to make commercial banks
pay for S&amp;L problems ``a deadly prescription for a dangerous
disease.''
   ``They seem crazy with desperation,'' she said. ``Their backs are
against the wall and they're not thinking straight.''
   The bankers group supports the Bush plan.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said S&amp;L groups, by asking for more time
on the capital standards, ``invite us ... by ignoring the lessons of
history, to relive it.'' Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev., characterized the
industry's position as ``let's have business as usual.''
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., saying the league had in the past
tried to play down S&amp;Ls' poor condition, told the lobbyists, ``You
have no credibility here today.''
   ``I'm sure you all have lots of friends here, but less than you
used to,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
   However, Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., said he would press for
provisions to ease capital requirements for smaller savings and
loans, such as those in his state.
   Bush last month proposed spending about $150 billion over 10
years _ half of it from taxpayers _ to close or sell insolvent S&amp;Ls.
He also would restructure the regulatory system by giving the
Treasury Department control over the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
Critics have charged the industry with exerting too much influence
over the S&amp;L agency.
   The league, but not the national council, opposes Bush's effort
to exert greater administration control over S&amp;L regulators.
   Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, the senior Republican on the committee,
said industry influence on regulators could be reduced without
turning over control to what he called ``the gnomes of Treasury.''

   Eastern Airlines today endured the fifth day of its
Machinists strike with a major court defeat that keeps its pilots
out of its planes, but a federal appeals court refused to allow
sympathy strikes at commuter railroads in the New York area.
   The pilots' union said its members at other airlines would follow
all safety rules to the letter again today, at whatever cost in
service delays. The clearest effect on travel, however, was at
Eastern, which was forced to lay off 9,500 employees this week and
ground most flights because of pilots' support of the 8,500-member
Machinists union strike over Eastern's demand for contract
concessions.
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis denied Eastern's
request for a temporary injunction forcing the airline's 3,600
pilots to return to work, despite warnings from Eastern's attorney
that the company faced imminent bankruptcy proceedings if pilots
weren't forced to cross picket lines.
   The airline flew just 57 flights of its Northeast Shuttle on
Tuesday, and 41 flights were used to return stranded planes to home
bases from South America and other points, Eastern spokesman Jim
Ashlock said today. Before the strike, Eastern had more than 1,000
flights daily.
   Eastern, which has only 1,500 employees of a pre-strike work
force of 31,200 still working and contends it has ``no business on
the books,'' said it planned to file an appeal this afternoon with
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the option to file for
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws remains ``a
course of last resort.'' However, some union leaders have contended
that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern owner Texas Air Corp., has
planned all along to tear the carrier apart.
   ``Mr. Lorenzo has obviously not got the trust and confidence of
his company. A company doesn't work unless it's a team,'' U.S.
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said today on CBS' ``This
Morning.''
   ``Congress can't get involved and the president can't get
involved. You don't create a working relationship between a company
and its employees by congressional act and you can't keep letting
the situation deteriorate,'' Skinner said.
   The pilots union reported that Eastern management called its
negotiators Tuesday evening to try to set up new talks for their
contract, which expired in June 1988. Union spokesman J.B. Stokes
said today that the contact ``was just a telephone conversation, a
contact. We're officially supposed to meet March 9.''
   The ruling in Miami against Eastern, is ``a victory for labor in
general,'' Eastern pilots' leader Jack Bavis told a raucous rally of
nearly 3,000 striking employees gathered downtown Tuesday night for
a teleconference beamed by satellite to 11 other groups across the
country.
   ``All of us or none of us!'' chanted the crowd of strikers who
jammed Miami's Knight Center.
   Earlier, about 200 non-union workers, most of them among those
laid off this week, demonstrated on company property across from
pickets, shouting ``We want our pilots back!''
   About 60 percent of the 40,000-member Air Line Pilots Association
on Tuesday followed its request that rule books be stringently
observed, said Capt. Roger Hall, a union spokesman.
   The job action began Tuesday and could cause major flight delays
around the country, but Hall said, ``the reports we have are that
there has been no effect on operations.''
   There were minor delays in arrivals at La Guardia Airport in New
York this morning that might have been caused by a pilots' slowdown,
said Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey. This morning, no major delays were reported at
O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.
   ``There have been sporadic requests for special handling by
flight crews,'' said FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein. ``The number is
very few. ... It hasn't disrupted the system.''
   President Bush, meanwhile, refused to budge from his opposition
to government intervention to halt the walkout that the Machinists
union, representing mechanics and ramp service workers, began
Saturday.
   A U.S. House panel, however, approved a bill that would compel
Bush to appoint an emergency board to study the 17-month contract
dispute and issue a recommendation. The action would include a
cooling-off period of up to 60 days in which striking employees
would return to work.
   Pilot leaders were trying to get support for the bill, which is
not expected to reach the House floor before next week. Lawmakers
concede there are not enough votes in Congress to override an
expected presidential veto.
   Bush told reporters the strike at Eastern, the nation's
seventh-largest airline, should be settled through bargaining. And
the president said if the Machinists try to shut down rail service
later this week, he will ask Congress to ban such secondary boycotts.
   Secondary boycotts, particularly in the New York metropolitan
area, could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people.
   Unions representing workers at three suburban New York rail lines
have appealed a federal judge's order issued last weekend barring
them from honoring any Machinist picket lines set up at railways.
The judge has extended his order, originally set to expire this
afternoon, through Friday.
   A three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals heard
arguments this morning and later refused to lift an order barring
commuter railroad workers in the New York area from honoring any
picket lines set up by striking Machinists.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson ``was wrong in enjoining
unions from engaging in secondary boycotts,'' said Machinists lawyer
Joseph Guerrieri Jr. ``The unions are free to engage in a full range
of secondary activities.''
   Appeals court Judge Irving R. Kaufman noted, ``Whatever we do,
really, is meaningless because you're going right to the Supreme
Court _ either side _ won't they?'' The lawyer for two of the
railroads conceded that was likely.
   Eastern, which carried 100,000 passengers on 1,040 flights daily
before the strike, has continued operating only its shuttle between
Washington, New York and Boston, and three round trips weekly
between Miami, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile.
   The airline wants $150 million in concessions; the Machinists
want $50 million in raises. Eastern has said it lost more than $1
billion this decade and $1 million a day before the strike.

without direction in dull European trading Wednesday, with the
market lacking any fresh news on which to trade.
   Gold prices rose.
   ``The market is slightly favorable toward the dollar, but there
is a lack of conviction over what extent the dollar should rise,''
one London dealer said.
   Another London dealer said: ``No one knows what's going to happen
next. There's an equal spread of people who think the dollar will
rise and those who think it will fall.''
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.7200 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7220 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.8585 West German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.5865
Swiss francs, up from 1.5847; 6.3080 French francs, up from 6.3000;
2.0930 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0945; 1,362.20 Italian lire, down
from 1,362.37; and, 1.20155 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1985.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 128.73 yen. Later, in
London, it also was quoted at 128.73 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $393.80 a troy ounce,
compared with $391.45 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, gold closed at a bid of $394.75 compared with $390.90
bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.74 to close at a bid of
$388.21.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.91 a troy ounce, compared with
$5.88 bid late Tuesday.

   Consolidated Oil and Gas Inc., recently taken over
by a group of disgruntled investors, has filed for Chapter 11
reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado.
   In its filing Tuesday, Consolidated listed assets of $38.6
million and liabilities of $51.5 million.
   The company has been under financial pressure in recent years
because of slumping oil and gas prices. In 1987, it reported a $9.3
million loss, compared with a loss of $21.5 million the previous
year.
   A group of investors headed by Maryland-based Energy Recovery
Fund and Texas-based Investment Limited Partners reacted by
launching a proxy fight for control of the company.
   The investors captured control of Consolidated late last year,
ousting existing management, including founder and chairman Harry
Trueblood.
   During the takeover bid, the investor group accused Trueblood and
the company's board of directors of milking the Consolidated assets
for their benefit.
   Consolidated officials did not immediately return phone calls
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Soybeans Break Sharply On Farmer Selling, Brazil Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as speculators were unnerved
by the looming Brazilian harvest and an increase in farmer selling.
   Grain futures fell in sympathy with soybeans.
   Soybean growers in Brazil, the world's second-largest producer
after the United States, are preparing to harvest their largest crop
ever.
   The movement of Brazilian _ and then Argentine _ soybeans into
the global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that has
contributed to the market's recent firm tone.
   The Agriculture Department has estimated Brazil's 1988-89 soybean
crop at 20 million metric tons compared with 17.8 million the
previous year. On Wednesday, a widely watched private weather
service raised its Brazilian soybean estimate to 20.7 million metric
tons from 19.6 million.
   ``I think the real qustion is not whether it's going to be a
record, but how much of a record,'' said Ted Mao, a grain specialist
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Mao said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days had
prompted more selling of stockpiled beans by U.S. producers.
   At the close, wheat was 1} cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.30 a bushel; corn was } cent to
2} cents lower with March at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to
5 cents lower with March at $2.05 a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents
to 11{ cents lower with March at $7.56 a bushel.

   The stock market gained ground today as traders
awaited new government figures on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 14.65 to 2,305.36 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 800 up, 548 down and
581 unchanged.
   Analysts said investors were growing more optimistic awaiting the
employment report for February from the Labor Department on Friday.
   Wall Streeters hope the data will show a slowing of economic
growth, providing a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and
a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates.
   That theme also seemed to catch on in the foreign-exchange
market, where the dollar rose, and in the credit markets, where
interest rates declined a bit.
   Traders also seemed to be impressed when the Dow Jones industrial
average broke through the 2,300 level at mid-session. The average
made a run past 2,300 on Tuesday but then fall back.
   Time Inc. slipped { to 116\ after jumping 9\ points on Tuesday.
The big gain was attributed to speculation that the company, in
reaching its weekend agreement to merge with Warner Communications,
might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from some other
direction.
   But some analysts quoted in press reports today said they were
skeptical that that would happen.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Express, up { at

Electric, up { at 45|, and Philip Morris, up 2} at 114].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was up .36 at 329.19.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 134.69 million shares with an

   Weirton Steel Corp. officials say a
vote to sell stock outside the company will help the employee-owned
steelmaker continue its $650 million modernization program.
   The employee owners voted by a 4-1 margin Tuesday night in favor
of selling stock to outside investors.
   Company officials and union officers of Weirton Steel announced
the voting results at Tuesday night's annual meeting held in
Steubenville. Approximately 8,000 employee owners cast ballots,
officials said. An exact tally was not immediately available,
officials said Wednesday.
   Weirton Steel officials announced Monday the rank and file of the
Independent Steelworkers Union had voted by a better than 3-1 ratio
to cut back the percentage of profit-sharing from 50 percent of
after-tax income to 35 percent.
   Both changes are designed to help the Weirton, W.Va., company
finance a $650 million modernization program that includes
renovation of the hot mill and the introduction of new continuous
casting facilities.
   Employee owners also have approved amendments to company bylaws
that will keep control of Weirton Steel in employee hands despite
the sale of stock on the open market.
   Weirton Steel celebrated its fifth anniversary as an
employee-owned company in January.

<HEAD>Christian Pilots Group at Eastern Appeals to Lorenzo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some Eastern Airlines pilots aren't as quick as fellow strikers
to vilify boss Frank Lorenzo with shrieked epithets and shredded
effigies _ they want to reach him through Christian dialogue and the
Scriptures.
   A group of pilots and other employees at strike-torn Eastern are
praying that ``someone sends Christian witness to Frank Lorenzo,''
said Bob Fuhrman, who has flown for Eastern for 16 years.
   ``We need some dignity; we need our voices to be heard,'' Fuhrman
told a reporter as he stood on a picket line Tuesday in the empty
Eastern terminal at Atlanta's sprawling Hartsfield International
Airport.
   Fuhrman, 43, said there are about 1,000 members in Eastern's
branch of the Fellowship of Christian Airline Personnel, including
about 100 pilots. The other members include Eastern flight
attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers and ticket agents.
   Many angry Eastern workers have screamed ``Down with Lorenzo!''
on airport picket lines up and down the East Coast. On the first
night of the walkout, strikers outside the airline's Miami office
tore up Lorenzo effigies and held placards reading: ``Frank Lorenzo:
We are Your Worst Nightmare!''
   Fuhrman has a quieter message for the chairman of Eastern's
parent, Texas Air Corp.:
   ``Mr. Lorenzo, I hope that you know the love of Jesus Christ and
if you don't, I hope that the Holy Spirit guides you to knowing the
love of Jesus Christ. We pray that if we can find that common bond
and we can stand in God's love and wisdom, we can run Eastern
Airlines.
   ``We need the dignity and we need the respect and we need your
love, Mr. Lorenzo.''
   Efforts to reach Lorenzo for comment weren't successful. He has
remained largely out of sight since the strike began. A Texas Air
spokesman, Ned Walker, did not immediately return telephone calls
from The Associated Press.
   Eastern's rival Delta Air Lines has succeeded where Eastern has
failed partly because Atlanta-based Delta ``has a Christian
philosophy,'' Fuhrman said.
   ``I think they run the airline by Christian philosophy at Delta.
They're there for the family; if someone has a problem, they're
there,'' said Fuhrman, who was furloughed as a pilot for 4{ years
starting in April 1973 and spent some of the time as an airline
cleaner. His wife Brenda has been a flight attendant at Eastern for
12{ years.
   Fuhrman wrote President Bush in mid-February asking him to
intervene in the Eastern dispute by extending the 30-day cooling-off
period that ended at midnight last Friday, triggering the strike.
   ``President Bush, I know we both share a faith in the Lord Jesus
Christ,'' Fuhrman's letter read. ``I ask of you in God's Wisdom to
consider my request, so that we might know the Mind of God
concerning the situation at Eastern which affects the lives of so
many people.''
   Fuhrman said he didn't receive a reply from Bush, who has stated
several times he wouldn't intervene.

<HEAD>Grand Met Sells Pillsbury Unit For $431 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and
liquor concern that acquired Pillsbury Co. earlier this year,
announced Wednesday the sale of the company's Steak and Ale and
Bennigan's restaurant chains to a management-led investor group for
$431 million.
   Grand Met said the investors included senior management of the
operating company for the two Dallas-based chains, S&amp;A Restaurant
Corp., and DJS-Inverness and Co., a New York-based private
investment partnership.
   Financing for the deal is to be provided by Citicorp Capital
Investors Ltd. and other sources, Grand Met said in a statement.
   Grand Met announced its intention to sell S&amp;A in January, after
the British conglomerate acquired Pillsbury for $5.7 billion,
because U.S. laws prohibit liquor companies from owning outlets
which sell alcoholic beverages. Grand Met's businesses include
liquor distilling.
   Wednesday's announcement followed a move Monday in which Grand
Met said it would lay off 550 of the 2,350 employees in Pillsbury's
Minneapolis headquarters, citing an ``overlap of functions'' and
desire to streamline the company.
   The layoffs affected all job classifications, from clerical
support employees to managerial and staff-level functions.
   Last week, Grand Met announced it had eliminated Pillsbury's
affirmative action office and created two new units, Grand
Metropolitan Foods Europe and Pillsbury International, to aid
international expansion of Pillsbury's food brands.
   Ian Martin, chairman of Pillsbury and a Grand Met director, said
proceeds from the restaurant sale would be invested in the growth of
its Pillsbury Foods and Burger King units ``to enhance our
shareholders' investment.''
   ``We received several expressions of interest,'' he said, but the
deal from the investor-led group was the only one to be ``clearly in
the best interests of the Pillsbury Co., Grand Met shareholders and
S&amp;A employees.''
   Stephen Carnes, an analyst at the investment firm Piper, Jaffray
&amp; Hopwood, said the sale should have positive effects for Pillsbury.
   ``The long-term winner is obviously Burger King,'' he said.
   In the year ended May 31, S&amp;A had operating income of $50 million
on sales of $716 million. It employs about 33,000 people with 159
Steak and Ale outlets in 24 states and 221 Bennigan's in 32 states.
   Grand Met is a real estate, liquor and gambling conglomerate. Its
U.S. holdings include Alpo dog food and Pearle Vision Centers, and
its liquor brands include Smirnoff vodka and J&amp;B scotch.
   Pillsbury makes Pillsbury flour, Green Giant vegetables, Haagen
Dazs ice cream and a variety of other products.
   Grand Met reported sales of more than $11 billion in fiscal 1988.
Pillsbury had sales of $6.2 billion.

<HEAD>Rising Car Inventories And Strong Production, Can They Mix?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers are likely to relay more on sales
incentives than on production cuts to reduce swollen inventories of
unsold cars, analysts say.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have been
maintaining production levels that have led to a big rise in the
number of automobiles on hand.
   The authoritative Ward's Automotive Reports said that at the end
of January, there was an 85-day supply of of cars made by U.S.-based
companies in inventory, up from 67 days at the end of December.
   Although incentives tend to cut into the automakers' profits,
they are more appealing to customers and autoworkers, who want to
keep production high.
   ``It's becoming increasingly clear that if you can maintain
production volumes at a fairly steady pace, it's easier to control
raw materials, your work force is happy and, ultimately, your
warranty costs come down,'' said analyst John Kirnan of Kidder,
Peabody &amp; Co. of New York.
   ``I think they're going to hesitate on the (cutting) production
route as long as possible and rely heavily on incentives,'' Kirnan
said Wednesday.
   GM's inventory was reported at 95 days, Ford's at 80 days and
Chrysler's was at 89 days, the weekly journal said.
   Higher inventories early in the year aren't particularly
worrisome to automakers, since January and February sales typically
are slower than other months and companies sometimes build up their
supplies before the usual spring sales rush.
   However, there is some concern on Wall Street.
   ``To the extent that inventory stays up and sales go down,
something has to give,'' said analyst Carol Verschell of Moody's
Investors Service Inc. of New York. ``Eventually, there will have to
be an adjustment, cut production or increase incentive programs.''
   GM has done both.
   Earlier this week, the nation's No. 1 automaker extended some
existing incentives into April and May and created new ones in an
effort to lure buyers to dealers' showrooms. Last week, GM doubled a
two-week shutdown of its Doraville, Ga., Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme
assembly plant because, as plant manager F. Thomas Brady said,
``We've got too many cars out in the field.''
   Chrysler did not immediately match GM's new incentives, but its
existing enticements have no time limits. On the same day GM issued
its new incentives, Ford Vice Chairman Harold Poling said his
company would remain competitive with other car makers' marketing
schemes.
   Ford is in better shape. For months, the No. 2 automaker has been
producing more than 15 percent of its vehicles on overtime, meaning
Ford can withstand a sales slump and still remain at full production.
   Chrysler, meantime, has been struggling in sales as a number of
its factories change over to new models or begin ``ramping up''
production of newly introduced cars.
   Last week, Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald said the Big
Three would be tested this month, when sales are expected to rise
from January and February levels amid continued reliance on
incentives.
   Car sales by the Big Three are down 10.6 percent during the first
two months of this year compared with January and February of 1988.
February car sales for GM, Ford and Chrysler were 14.4 percent below
the pace for the same month last year.
   Verschell and Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. wondered whether the usual spring buying surge
would be enough to shrink inventories to levels easing pressure to
boost incentives or cut production.
   ``There are just so many cars out there fighting for the same
consumer,'' Verschell said.
   ``I don't think it's going to be enough to reduce it,'' Heaney
said.
   But Kirnan was more bullish about spring sales, saying, ``The
inventory problem will probably disappear by late March and early
April, and production schedules are probably going to be maintained
for the second and third quarter.
   ``I just don't the,'' Kirnan added. ``I think thee degree that
some people believe,'' Kirnan added. ``I think the traditional types
of incentives are going to continue to do some magic.''

   Energy futures prices rose Wednesday, driven by
market rumors and technical factors.
   The April contract for the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
West Texas Intermediate, settled 24 cents higher at $18.54a barrel,
regaining some of the ground lost Tuesday when the contract fell 37
cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
April contract for wholesale home heating oil settled 0.29 cent
higher at 51.37 cents a gallon, after falling 0.35 cent the previous
session.
   April unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.18 cent on Tuesday, rose
0.44 cent to 51.85 cents a gallon.
   ``Having settled on a sour note Tuesday night ... the market has
really turned around,'' said Mary L. Haskins, a vice president at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Some of incentive for the turnaround came from reports
circulating in the market of a conflict between Iran and Iraq.
   Before details of the reported conflict filtered fully through
the market, energy futures rallied temporarily with dealers buying
in speculation that tensions between the two Persian Gulf countries
might cause supply disruptions. The buying lost momentum once it
became clear in the market that the conflict referred to an incident
that occurred in mid-February.
   But at the same time, the rally drove crude past technical price
thresholds that triggered more buying, Haskins said.

   The dollar strengthened Wednesday against all
major currencies in moderate trading as some traders concluded that
the Bush administration was showing flexibility on a tax increase to
reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Gold prices declined after rising overseas. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a bid of $391.90 a troy ounce of gold around
4 p.m. EST, down $1 from Tuesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rally Wednesday to a
report quoting Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council
of Economic Advisers, as saying the administration ``has not ruled
out a discussion'' of taxes as part of a formal budget negotiation.
   Boskin also said the administration has not abandoned its
opposition to higher taxes. His statements were consistent with
those of other administration officials in recent weeks.
   Nevertheless, the market chose to interpret Boskin's testimony as
good news for the dollar. Robert Ryan, senior currency trader for
Irving Trust Co., said, ``Bush is now conceding that he may allow
higher taxes.''
   Dealers said there were reports of the Federal Reserve selling
small amounts of dollars to stem its rise Wednesday but that most
market participants saw that intervention as more symbolic.
   ``I think they just wanted to remind us that they were still out
there,'' Ryan said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.30 Japanese yen to a closing 128.73 yen. It also
was quoted at 128.73 yen in London, and later, in New York, it rose
to 129.225 yen from 128.825 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound in London, where it
cost $1.7200 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7220 late Tuesday.
Sterling fetched $1.7155 in New York, down from $1.72155.
   Other later dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.86325 West German marks, up from 1.85525; 1.5910
Swiss francs, up from 1.5845; 1.20145 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19825; 6.3230 French francs, up from 6.3030; and 1,366.875 Italian
lire, up from 1,362.625.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday: 1.8585
West German marks, up from 1.8520; 1.5865 Swiss francs, up from
1.5847; 6.3080 French francs, up from 6.3000; 2.0930 Dutch guilders,
down from 2.0945; 1,362.20 Italian lire, down from 1,362.37; and,
1.20155 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1985.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $393.10 a troy ounce, down from $393.30 late
Tuesday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $393.80 an ounce,
compared with $391.45 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid of $394.75 an ounce, vs. $390.90 Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $4.74 to close at a bid of
$388.21 an ounce.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery settled at $5.865 a troy ounce, down
from $5.874. Silver rose in London to a late bid price of $5.91 an

nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
785 up, 629 down and 556 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 167.62 million
shares, down from 172.50 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 198.36 million shares.
   Analysts said investors were growing more optimistic awaiting the
employment report for February from the Labor Department on Friday.
   Wall Streeters hope the data will show a slowing of economic
growth, providing a favorable portent for the inflation outlook and
a possible easing of upward pressure on interest rates.
   That theme also seemed to catch on in the foreign-exchange
market, where the dollar rose, and in the credit markets, where
interest rates declined a bit.
   With all that, however, the late pullback meant that, for the
second straight session, the Dow Jones industrial average turned
back after it crossed the 2,300 level.
   Time Inc. dropped 1~ to 114~ after jumping 9\ points on Tuesday.
The big gain was attributed to speculation that the company, in
reaching its weekend agreement to merge with Warner Communications,
might have opened itself up to a takeover bid from some other
direction.
   But some analysts quoted in press reports today said they were
skeptical that that would happen.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 2[ at
113}; DuPont, up \ at 99}; Procter &amp; Gamble, up ] at 88}, and
General Electric, up \ at 45].
   However, International Business Machines slipped \ to 119| and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was down ] at 30{.
   Schering Plough rose 1\ to 63[. Late Tuesday the company said it
was expecting a 20 percent increase in earnings this year, and would
invest $340 million in research and development.
   Texas Air, the most active American Stock Exchange issue, climbed
| to 13[. The machinists' union that has been striking the company's
Eastern Airlines subsidiary since last Saturday said it wanted to
revive talks with Carl Icahn, chairman of Trans World Airlines,
about a possible deal to take Eastern over.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $2.91 billion, or 0.10
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.17 to 165.45.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .26 to 339.81, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up .21 at 294.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .22 to 406.40. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 329.15, up .32.

<HEAD>Mexico Said Seeking To Slash Foreign Debt Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ISAAC A. LEVI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico has told the International Monetary
Fund it aims to slash payments on its huge foreign debt to get its
stagnant economy growing again, two leading newspapers said
Wednesday.
   The privately owned El Financiero and the government newspaper El
Nacional said President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration
informed the IMF in a draft-letter of intent that it plans to reduce
payments to 2 percent from 5 percent of the annual gross national
product over the next three years.
   El Financiero said the letter was drafted after an IMF team
visited Mexico City last week to evaluate an application for $500
million in ``special drawing rights'' to bolster the country's
foreign currency reserves. Special drawing rights, or SDRs, are a
type of international money created by the IMF for use in settling
international payment imbalances.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe toured Mexico's principal creditor
nations in February, unsucessfully seeking $100 million in fresh
loans from private banks, together with a reduction in the paper
value of the country's debt.
   Quoting unnamed government sources, the two newspapers said the
debt situation was analyzed by Aspe and other members of the
cabinet's economic team at a meeting with Salinas Tuesday night.
   Government spokesmen refused to talk about the debt situation.
``In due time, we shall make the appropriate information public,''
Treasury Department spokesman Rafael Diaz de Leon replied in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   Salinas wants to use money saved on debt payments to spur
economic growth to about 4.5 percent annually, El Nacional said.
   After two decades of 6 percent growth, the economy completely
stagnated under Salinas' predecessor, President Miguel de la Madrid,
in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep up with
debt payments.
   Despite efforts to encourage non-petroleum exports, reduce
government deficit spending and cut inflation, the economy has
remained in the doldrums.
   Salinas _ de la Madrid's budget secretary _ has been warning
since he took office in December that Mexico may be forced to
suspend debt payments if it fails to wrest timely concessions from
foreign creditors.
   Officials have been saying Mexico wants to cut its annual service
costs by about $7 billion from the $14 billion in principal and
interest paid last year and the $16 billion scheduled for 1989.
   The World Bank estimates Mexico's debt was $106 billion in
December. Deputy Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria on Tuesday
denied the debt had gone up to $108 billion and said it was actually
on $100 billion.
   Gurria said in a television interview that the public sector
foreign debt currently stands at $81 billion, the short-term
inter-bank debt at $7 billion, the private sector debt at $7
billion, and the International Monetary Fund is owed another $5
billion.
   El Financiero quoted the eight-page letter to the IMF as saying
the ``present (debt) situation is not acceptable or sustainable''
and ``it is urgent the Mexican economy start growing again'' in
order to check growing unemployment.
   From 1982 to 1988 the economy failed to grow, per capita income
dropped some 15 to 20 percent, the purchasing power of wages was
halved, the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
   The letter said Mexico needs to create 1 million jobs annually
just to take care of new entries in the job market, but created only
1 million jobs over the six-year period.
   On the positive side, the letter noted that inflation was reduced
from 159 percent in 1987 to 52 percent in 1988 and is projected at
no more than 20 percent this year.
   The letter said that during that period, Mexico's nonpetroleum
exports have jumped from $3 billion to $14 billion last year,
roughly equaling the income derived from crude oil, according to the
newspaper.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders filed three suits in
Delaware state court Wednesday to block the planned $18 billion
merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications Inc.
   One of the suits, filed by four Warner shareholders against Time
and Warner, Warner's board of directors and Warner Chairman, Steven
Ross, alleged the merger and a planned preliminary exchange of stock
between the two companies _ known as a lock-up transaction _ would
prevent an outsider from making a possibly higher bid for Warner.
   In the lock-up, Time will exchange 12.5 percent of its stock for
12 percent of Warner's shares. Such transactions commonly are
undertaken by companies planning to merge as a defense against
unwanted takeovers.
   ``The merger and lock-up transaction are nothing more than a plan
and scheme by the director-defendants to entrench themselves and to
make it much more difficult and highly unlikely that Warner will be
subject to an outside takeover,'' said the class action suit, filed
in Delaware Chancery Court.
   The suit asked the court to declare the merger void or
alternatively prevent the defendants from proceeding with it.
   The merger, which would be accomplished through a stock swap,
would create the world's largest communications concern, Time Warner
Inc.
   Spokesmen for Time and Warner said their companies had no comment
on the suit.
   Court papers for the other two suits were not immediately
available, and it was not immediately known who filed the actions or
who the defendants were.
   The suits were filed in Delaware because Time and Warner are
incorporated here.

<TEXT>
   If a student in the Big Apple wants to give
teacher a little apple, it will have to come from home. Fresh apples
have been pulled from school cafeteria menus because of worries
about carcinogenic pesticides.
   The Board of Education, which feeds students in 1,200 public and
parochial schools under a federal program, barred the sale of apples
last month, at least until it receives advice from the Environmental
Protection Agency, said Kevin Gill, director of support services for
the board.
   The Washington-based National Resource Defense Council has
reported that the pesticide diaminozide, which is known by its brand
name Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children who
drink a lot of apple juice.
   Apple growers contended only about 4 percent of all apples sold
in the United States show any traces of Alar and those amounts are
well below EPA standards.
   Alar is used to maintain firmness and resist bruising in fruits
and vegetables.
   Gill's program sells or hands out about 13 million apples a year.
He said students had not been complaining about the fruit's
disappearance. ``It's only been a few weeks, and we offer a wide
variety of fruits,'' he said.
   Applesauce and apple juice are harder to replace and will
continue to be served, he said.

   A New York investor group that has agreed
to buy Worlds of Wonder Inc. announced Wednesday it plans to appoint
the former president of Mattel Electronics as president and chief
executive.
   The group named Joshua W. Denham, who served as president of
Mattel Electronics from 1979 to 1983 and most recently was president
of Wonder Products in Bosler City, La.
   Denham will assume responsibility for operating the company after
confirmation of a bankruptcy reorganization plan.
   Worlds of Wonder, which at one time had $300 million in annual
sales with toys like Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag, filed for Chapter
11 protection in December 1987.
   The investor group agreed Feb. 20 to purchase Worlds of Wonder
for an undisclosed amount. The group is led by Eli Jacobs and
includes Franklyn S. Barry Jr., former president of Fisher-Price
Toys, and David Edelman, former president of Ingram Software.
   The acquisition still must be approved by the federal bankruptcy
court. The group expects confirmation of its reorganization plan in
mid-May, according to a Worlds of Wonder statement.
   Following confirmation of the reorganization plan, the current
president and chief executive officer of the company, Stephen J.
Hopkins, will return to the Connecticut management consulting firm
Nightingale &amp; Associates Inc., the statement said.

   Natural gas from Wyoming will flow to California
under an agreement announced Wednesday between Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. and a unit of Houston-based Coastal Corp.
   Coastal's Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. said PG&amp;E has agreed to
withdraw its opposition to WyCal's proposal to provide new
interstate natural gas pipeline capacity to California.
   WyCal will provide interstate shippers on WyCal's proposed
pipeline system with the option in California of utilizing WyCal's
pipeline or a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-regulated
expansion of San Francisco-based PG&amp;E's existing facilities for
transportation within California.
   In January, the regulatory commission authorized WyCal to
construct and operate a 650 million cubic feet per day natural gas
pipeline system from the Overthrust producing region in Wyoming to
Kern County, Calif. Through interconnections with other pipelines,
the WyCal system also can transport Canadian natural gas.
   Under either alternative, shippers would be assured of FERC
regulation of their transportation contracts for up to 25 years.
After 25 years, jurisdiction would be subject to regulation by the
California Public Utilities Commission.
   PG&amp;E has been granted the right to purchase 50 million cubic feet
a day of firm transportation capacity on WyCal's system for 20
years. If PG&amp;E exercises that right, it can acquire a 25 percent
ownership interest in the WyCal system.

<TEXT>
   Multimillionaire financier Michael Milken is
planning his first speech here since Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
agreed to fire him as part of a securities fraud plea deal with the
government, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   Milken is scheduled to deliver the keynote address next week at a
financial industry black-tie dinner honoring the ``chief executive
officers of the decade'' as selected by Financial World magazine,
spokesman Kenneth Lerer said.
   Milken was named in a Securities and Exchange Commission civil
suit against Drexel last September in connection with securities
fraud charges that included insider trading. He is expected to be
indicted on criminal fraud and racketeering charges.
   Milken has headed Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., ``junk'' bond
financing department since the mid-1970s and is credited with
turning the low-cost, high-yield securities into a $175 billion
annual market. The bonds often are used to finance takeovers and the
growth of small- to medium-sized companies.
   Lerer said Milken last spoke in New York at a business luncheon
in December, several weeks before terms of Drexel's plea deal with
the government settling criminal charges against were announced.
   Under the deal, Drexel agreed to pay $650 million in fines and
restitution and plead guilty to six felonies. The deal is pending a
separate settlement with the SEC on civil charges.
   Milken, who has denied any wrongdoing, recently asked a federal
judge in Manhattan to modify or throw out the agreement on the
grounds it violates his rights. Drexel agreed in the deal to dismiss
Milken and withhold his 1988 compensation of well over $100 million.
   Lerer said Milken is working part-time at Drexel while preparing
his legal defense. He said Milken also regularly attends charity and
financial community dinners. He is not scheduled to receive an award
at the New York dinner.

   The volume of help wanted advertising declined in

   The business-supported financial research organization said its
Help Wanted Index declined to 155 in January, compared with readings

   In January 1988, the index, which measures the volume of

is considered sensitive to changes in demand for labor, stood at 152.
   The Conference Board said the volume of help wanted ads rose in
New England and in the West North Central and East North Central

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell as much as 10} cents a bushel
Wednesday, erasing much of the past week's gains as speculators
unnerved by the looming Brazilian harvest and an increase in farmer
selling backed away from the market.
   On other markets Wednesday, energy futures posted strong gains on
signs of renewed tensions between Iran and Iraq; precious metals
retreated; copper futures fell; and livestock and meat futures
finished mostly lower.
   Grain futures followed soybeans lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Wheat settled 1} cents to 4 cents lower with March at $4.30 a
bushel; corn was } cent to 2} cents lower with March at $2.75{ a
bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 5 cents lower with March at $2.05 a
bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 10} cents lower with March at
$7.55{ a bushel.
   Soybean growers in Brazil, the world's second-largest producer
after the United States, are preparing to harvest their largest crop
ever.
   The movement of Brazilian _ and then Argentine _ soybeans into
the global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that has
contributed to the market's recent firm tone.
   The Agriculture Department has estimated Brazil's 1988-89 soybean
crop at 20 million metric tons compared with 17.8 million the
previous year. On Wednesday, a widely watched private weather
service raised its Brazilian soybean estimate to 20.7 million metric
tons from 19.6 million.
   ``I think the real question is not whether it's going to be a
record crop, but how much of a record,'' said Ted Mao, a grain
specialist with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   U.S. soybean growers harvested 1.54 billion bushels last year, or
about 41 million metric tons.
   Mao said said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days had
prompted more selling of stockpiled beans by U.S. producers.
   Oil futures rallied on the New York Mercantile Exchange following
a report that Iran's United Nations ambassador had accused Iraqi
soldiers of killing five Iranian soldiers on Feb. 17.
   The incident would mark the bloodiest clash between the Middle
Eastern nations since the beginning of their 7-month cease-fire.
   The energy market's rally also was seen as partly a reaction to
Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report, which showed
declines in U.S. stocks of gasoline and distillates, although
crude-oil supplies increased.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 45 cents
higher with April at $18.54 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent to
.97 cent higher with April at 51.37 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .44 cent to .83 cent higher with April at 51.85 cents a
gallon.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange, selling off late in the session after gold for April
delivery encountered resistance at $398.80 a troy ounce.
   Bernard Savaiko, a metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New
York, said April gold's failure to close above $396 an ounce
indicated ``the recent rally is tiring.''
   Gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with April at $395.40 an
ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.8 cents lower with May at $5.947 a
troy ounce.
   Copper futures also finished lower on the Commodity Exchange
after initially rising. Analysts said the decline reflected
perceptions that physical demand for copper has slowed with the
metal's rise in price during the past month.
   Copper settled 2.9 cents to 4.1 cents lower with May at $1.404 a
pound.
   Weakening cash markets contributed to a late slump in cattle
futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Most pork futures
retreated on ideas that Wednesday's increase in hog marketings would
result in lower cash prices on Thursday.
   Live cattle finished .25 cent to .45 cent lower with April at
77.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with March at 81.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with April at 44.10 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .12 cent higher with March at
38.85 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices for Mexican crude oil exports to the
Far East rose by 23 cents per barrel in February over January
levels, the government oil monopoly Pemex said Wednesday.
   Exports of Pemex's light Isthmus crude sold in the Far East at
$15.08 a barrel last month, up from $14.85 in January, Pemex said.
The monopoly's heavy Maya grade sold at $12.43 a barrel in February,
up from $12.20, Pemex said.
   ``These price increases for Mexican export crudes reflect the
favorable evolution of the international petroleum market,'' Pemex
said.
   Mexico has announced it will cut its exports April 1 by 5
percent, or 68,600 barrels a day, to buttress producers' efforts to
shore up prices on the international market. Mexico's base level of
exports was 1.35 million barrels per day in 1988.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed last
year to cut its members' production by 4 million barrels a day, to
around 18.5 million barrels. Mexico, the world's sixth-largest oil
producer, does not belong to the 13-nation cartel but closely
monitors its pricing and production guidelines.
   Most Mexican crude exports to the Far East market are purchased
by Japan, Mexico's third-biggest customer last year, Pemex said.
Japan will buy 180,000 barrels per day of Mexican crude in 1989.

Fuji will have an equal stake in the venture, he said.
   The 75,000-square-foot plant, designed to serve the North

its kind in the world,'' Howland said.
   An estimated 375 million 3.5-inch floppy disks with a retail
value of $600 million will be sold in North America this year. By
1991, the market is expected to grow to 600 million units with a
retail value of over $1 billion, Howland said.
   Among the joint venture's competitors are Sony, Maxell, TDK, 3M
and Eastman Kodak Co.'s Verbatim. BASF Corp., headquartered in
Parsippany, N.J., is a division of BASF AG of Ludwigshaven, West
Germany. Fuji's parent is Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd. of Tokyo.

<HEAD>Mesa Airlines Forms Skyway Airlines to Serve Eight Midwest Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Airlines Inc. has formed a
subsidiary, Skyway Airlines, that will begin flights April 17
between eight Midwest cities and Milwaukee, company officials said
Wednesday.
   Skyway initially will have three twin-propjet 1900 Beechcraft
airplanes serving Green Bay and Appleton, Wis.; Des Moines, Iowa;
Saginaw, Grand Rapids, Flint and Muskegon, Mich.; and Rockford, Ill.
   Larry Risley, Mesa's chairman and chief executive officer of
Mesa, said the company signed a code-sharing agreement with Midwest
Express Airlines, based in Milwaukee.
   Such an agreement, usually between a major carrier and a commuter
airline, allows a traveler to book a flight from a city served by
the first airline to one served by the second with just one
reservation.
   Mesa services 25 communities in New Mexico, Wyoming, Arizona,
California, Colorado and Texas.
   Midwest Express, a subsidiary of Kimberly-Clark Corp., has 11
DC-9 jetliners serving Washington, D.C.; New York City; Newark,
N.J.; Boston; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Dallas; Detroit;
Philadelphia; Grand Rapids; Madison, Wis.; Appleton and Denver from
the company's Milwaukee hub.

   Eastern Airlines slashed its shuttle fares and sold all its gates
in Philadelphia in the fifth day of a Machinists strike Wednesday,
and its sister carrier Continental Airlines took up the lucrative
New York-Miami run.
   Eastern, in a desperate attempt to lure back customers to its
ailing Northeast shuttle service, said it will reduce one-way fares
to $12 on weekends, from $69-$99, and $49 weekdays, down from $99.
   Pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safety
rules, but for a second day there was little evidence of a backup on
runways.
   Houston-based Continental announced it would begin daily nonstop
flights from New York City's LaGuardia Airport to Miami on Thursday.
Continental said it will run four daily round trips.
   ``This is not a direct result of the Eastern strike,''
Continental spokesman Ned Walker said of the new routes. ``What this
is, is a response to market demand of what we've seen in the past
few days.''
   In Philadelphia, USAir announced it had closed a $70 million deal
with Eastern, after months of talks, to acquire all eight of the
airline's gates at Philadelphia International Airport, third-largest
of the airline's four hubs.
   USAir said it will use the counter space, along with baggage and
related services, for operations of Piedmont Airlines, which will
merge with USAir this year.
   Eastern picked up $15 million more in a separate deal, selling
USAir its Philadelphia-Tornonto and Philadelphia-Montreal routes for
$15 million.
   USAir said both deals would require court approval if Eastern
declares bankruptcy.
   The labor dispute rested Wednesday with courts in New York,
Philadelphia and Atlanta, where Eastern went to court to appeal a
judge's refusal to order union pilots back to the cockpits.
   Eastern contends it is near collapse, losing at least $2 million
a day. Its lawyer said in court Tuesday the nation's seventh-largest
carrier cannot survive the week if its pilots maintain their support
for the Machinists.
   The airline is running just 4 percent of its flights and says it
will consider bankruptcy court, though as a last resort. It sent
9,500 workers home this week and has just a skeleton staff of 1,500
remaining.
   The 8,500-member Machinists union walked out Saturday, and with
the support of pilots and flight attendants soon nearly shut down
Eastern. Eastern is seeking $125 million in concessions; the union
wants $50 million in raises.
   The Machinists also threatened to disrupt commuter rail traffic
with secondary boycotts, which it contends are legal under the 1926
Railway Labor Act. But the union held off when a federal judge in
New York over the weekend temporarily barred rail workers from
honoring Machinists picket lines.
   Among developments:
   _ The Machinists have asked Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl C.
Icahn to seek control of the carrier, and he said he is willing to
talk with them.
   ``I would be willing to speak to the unions only if Eastern
permits me to, because I do not want to be accused by Eastern of
interfering with the collective bargaining process,'' Icahn said in
a statement.
   Icahn had mulled a bid for Eastern a few months ago, when its
boss, Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, was considering
selling. But Icahn and the unions couldn't agree on terms for a
worker stake in a merger of TWA and Eastern, and talks broke off.
   Eastern had no comment. Charles E. Bryan, president of Machinists
District 100, would not comment on Icahn's statement but said in
Miami: ``If there is willingness (by Eastern) to sell, there are
certainly interested parties. ... It would be a tremendous
opportunity to see the phoenix rise from the ashes.''
   _ In Miami, Eastern marketing vice president, George Brennan
denied that reduced shuttle fares were a move to protect the pending
$365 million sale of the shuttle service to New York developer
Donald Trump. Competitor Pan Am Corp. said it would not match the
fares.
   _ In New York City, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused
to allow commuter rail workers in the New York area to honor any
Machinists picket lines. But the judges said they expect the dispute
to go to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   _ U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson, who issued the initial
ruling, heard arguments Wednesday evening on whether to make
permanent his ban, covering Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road,
Metro-North Commuter Railroad and New Jersey Transit. The railroads
carry hundreds of thousands of commuters.
   Patterson, after 7{ hours testimony, recessed the hearing until
10 a.m. Thursday. He was not expected to rule immediately; his
orders barring strikes at Amtrak and the other railroads expire at
midnight Friday.
   _ Eastern lawyers filed notice with a federal appeals court in
Atlanta on plans to continue efforts to force pilots to work. ``I
don't expect our brief to be filed until tomorrow morning,'' said
Eastern attorney David Ross.
   _ In Philadelphia, a federal judge Wednesday issued a preliminary
injunction, extending a temporary restraining order that prohibited
rail unions from honoring pickets set up by Machinists at
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority facilities, which
carry 100,000 passengers daily.
   _ The Air Lines Pilots Association, whose contract with Eastern
expired in June, said the airline has asked to set up talks. Union
spokesman J.B. Stokes said a meeting was set for Thursday.
   _ President Bush has resisted calls from organized labor and some
members of Congress that he appoint an emergency panel to mediate.
But he has also said he will not tolerate disruptions throughout the
transportation industry.
   ``The president believes that in a free enterprise system workers
in business should work out their differences without congressional
or governmental interference,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel K.
Skinner said Wednesday on CBS' ``This Morning.''
   If Bush intercedes, an emergency panel could impose a 60-day
cooling-off period.
   Some union officials have said throughout the 17-month dispute
that Eastern and Lorenzo want to dismantle the airline.
   ``Our people have recognized from the very earliest days of this
dispute that that kind of a result (bankruptcy) could be
forthcoming,'' said Machinists union President William Winpisinger.
   ``They are so fed up with the way they have been treated, so fed
up with the environment on the job, that they're willing to walk
away and if that is the result they'll accept it,'' he said on the
CBS program.
   Airports reported no problems on the second day of a work-to-rule
action by union pilots around the country.
   ``We're operating close to normal,'' said Mort Edelstein,
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. ``There have been
sporadic requests for special handling by flight crews,'' such as
having instructions repeated.
   ``There are no problems,'' John Braden, spokesman at Hartsfield
Atlanta International Airport. ``We've got so much air space we're
looking for new carriers.''
