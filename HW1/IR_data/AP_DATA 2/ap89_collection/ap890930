<HEAD>Hungary Refuses to Sign Paper at International Communist Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary refused to sign a final
statement at a meeting of communist officials from 12 countries,
saying the document made false accusations against West Germany, a
news report said.
   Geza Kotai, secretary for international affairs of the Hungarian
Communist Party, said Friday his delegation disagreed with charges
of ``revanchism'' and ``neo-Fascism'' gaining ground in ``certain
countries,'' the state news agency MTI reported.
   Kotai said his delegation considered these were references to
West Germany. ``We refute them,'' the agency quoted him as saying.
   Hungary angered East Germany earlier this month by opening its
borders to East Germans emigrating to the West. Other hard-line
communist nations, such as Czechoslovakia and Romania, have joined
East Germany in condemning Bonn.
   Kotai also said his delegation to the three-day meeting in
Varna, Bulgaria could not accept the document because it referred
to strengthening state ownership of property, since Hungarian
communists advocate a market economy.
   It was believed the first time that a communist delegation
refused to sign the final communique at a meeting.

   Suspected paramilitary forces dragged three
men from their homes and killed them, and three people were slain
in other attacks blamed on rebels, police and witnesses said.
   The craftsmen were taken from their homes Friday by four men in
military clothing and armed with assault rifles and revolvers in
Ayacucho, a rebel stronghold about 230 miles southeast of Lima,
according to a victim's daughter.
   The four men shot the victims in the head and fled, said
Inocenta Viga.
   The incident occurred during an army-enforced curfew imposed 10
days ago, after the assassination of Ayacucho's mayor by suspected
Maoist Shining Path rebels.
   In the last year, paramilitary death squads have appeared,
slaying suspected backers of the leftist Shining Path.
   In another incident Friday, police said five Shining Path
guerrillas entered a primary school in the jungle town of San
Martin de Pangoa, 160 miles east of Lima and opened fire with
sub-machine guns, killing the school's principal and a teacher.
   In the town of Marcara, 220 miles northeast of Lima, Shining
Path rebels shot and killed an agronomist and wounded the town's
former Marxist mayor.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in
insurgency-related violence since 1980, when the Shining Path
launched its struggle against Peru's elected government.

<HEAD>Senate Balking at Bush's Capital Gains Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's capital gains tax cut, which
won a bitter fight in the House, may face trouble in the Senate
because of concerns that it is ill-timed and gives too large a tax
savings to the nation's richest people.
   The Senate has traditionally leaned strongly toward such
reductions, but some senators who have favored capital gains cuts
in the past find the new proposal unacceptable because of the
current budget deficit and its tilt to the wealthy.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and
longtime backer of lower taxes on capital gains, said he will
recommend that a capital gains cut not be included when the
committee begins work Monday on a deficit-reduction plan.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, said Friday that an incentive for saving and
investment is needed, but a temporary cut followed by an increased
rate ``would destabilize the markets. It's sheer budget gimmickry.''
   Instead, Bentsen is proposing that tax-deductible Individual
Retirement Accounts be made available to more workers to encourage
saving.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., a member of the committee, said the
panel is likely to reject the capital gains reduction and accept
the IRA alternative.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said ``I
think there is a reasonably good chance we'll be able to prevail''
in the Senate and defeat the capital gains cut.
   If that happened, tax-writers from the House and Senate would
have to negotiate some kind of compromise that could include both a
capital gains reduction and liberalized IRAs.
   In a hard-fought vote Thursday, the House accepted a plan
supported by Bush that would reduce capital gains tax rates for 27
months. The maximum rate, now 33 percent, would be cut to 20
percent. On Jan. 1, 1992, the top rate would be raised to 28
percent and investments ``indexed'' so that profits caused by
inflation would not be taxed.
   There is general agreement that cutting the rates would
encourage investors to sell assets before the rates rose again,
generating about $9.4 billion in new revenue over three years.
Bentsen insists ``this yo-yo effect'' would do nothing to encourage
long-term investment.
   But the strongest political point about the capital gains cut is
that by any reckoning, most of the tax saving would go to those
with the greatest wealth.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the reduction would
simply be ``mailing a check for $25,000 to every Republican
contributor in the last campaign.''
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that people with
incomes above $200,000 who report capital gains would get tax cuts
averaging $24,906 apiece.
   ``It is hard for me to understand why this whole discussion has
to reach the level of rich versus poor,'' Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady told a Senate Finance Committee hearing Friday.
   ``The rich are getting richer in this country and the poor are
getting poorer,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``You'll have to
forgive us for bringing it up.''
   The joint-committee staff, which provides tax expertise to the
House and Senate, estimates 80 percent of the tax saving from the
capital gains cut would go to couples and individuals with incomes
above $100,000 a year.
   Brady contends that figure is misleading because the
over-$100,000 category includes many people of relatively modest
earnings who, once in a lifetime, sell a small business or a home
and show greater incomes in that one year.
   The secretary estimated that 47 percent of capital gains are
realized by people whose other income _ not including the gains _
is less than $50,000 a year.
   But Bentsen said the joint-committee staff found that only 18
percent of the gains were taken by people who reported just one
capital gains transaction _ including sale of a home or business _
a year.
   Brady also said more than 80 percent of the tax saving from the
IRA expansion proposed by Bentsen would go to workers with incomes
above $50,000 a year.

   Police fired on crowds protesting the
arrest of a separatist leader in northern Jammu-Kashmir state,
killing at least five people and wounding 75, officials said.
   Authorities imposed a curfew and deployed soldiers in Anantnag,
where three people were killed by police gunfire Friday, a
government spokesman said. Protesters set fire to official jeeps
and threw homemade bombs at government buildings, he said.
   A fourth person was shot dead by police gunfire during protests
in Sopore town, and a fifth died and 15 were wounded when police
fired on crowds in Srinagar, the spokesman said.
   Demonstrators were protesting the arrest of Shabir Ahmed Shah,
leader of the People's League, the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   The People's League is an underground group calling for the
state to secede from India and join Pakistan. Shah, who calls for
armed struggle to achieve the group's aims, was arrested Thursday,
the spokesman said.
   India and Pakistan both claim Jammu-Kashmir and have fought
three wars over the state since both countries gained independence
from Britain in 1947. Jammu-Kashmir is India's only mainly Moslem
state.

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators are telling
federal arts agencies not to give any money to obscene art, but
they're backing away from stronger standards proposed by Sen. Jesse
Helms.
   Under a compromise reached Friday, the National Endowment for
the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities would receive
budgets in the 1990 fiscal year provided they implement new
standards in giving grants.
   The provision is a weakening of a Senate-passed measure backed
by Helms, R-N.C., that called for banning federal aid for art that
is ``obscene or indecent'' or that ``denigrates'' a religion, race,
ethnic background, age group or handicap.
   Instead, grants would be denied to art that depicts
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or ``individuals engaged in the sex act.''
   And, borrowing from a Supreme Court ruling on obscenity, the
conferees said the art works denied funding would have to be
``utterly devoid of'' significant literary, artistic, scholarly,
scientific or political value.
   The agreement cleared the way for House and Senate agreement on
a bill to provide about $11 billion for federal land and cultural
programs for the next fiscal year, which begins Sunday.
   The agreement sought to end a controversy over what arts groups
say is close to censorship. Helms and his backers said it was a
matter of whether works considered by many to be obviously
offensive should be getting taxpayer money.
   ``I don't know if it's a victory for anybody,'' said Rep. Sidney
Yates, D-Ill., the chief House negotiator.
   ``I'm not fully pleased, but it's a way of resolving differences
between the House and Senate,'' said Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho.
   The Senate, by 65-31, voted Friday to urge the negotiators to
adopt the toned-down prohibition on federal assistance.
   A day before, the Senate had rejected Helms by a surprisingly
wide margin, voting 62-35 against a resolution backing his stand.
Helms' amendment had been adopted July 26 by voice vote with few
lawmakers in the chamber.
   Yates said the compromise probably wouldn't have a significant
impact on what art gets federal backing.
   ``The endowment hasn't been known to approve very adventurous
art in the past,'' he said.
   The endowments for the arts and humanities would get $250,000 in
the bill to form a commission to study how grants are awarded and
determine whether criteria are needed for works to qualify for
grants.
   Negotiators also agreed that grants this year to the two
organizations that displayed the art works that sparked the
controversy will be subjected to congressional review.
   Senators had sought a five-year ban on funding to the
Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
and the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University of
Pennsylvania.
   The North Carolina center exhibited a photograph by Andres
Serrano depicting a crucifix in a jar of urine. The Pennsylvania
group showed photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe depicting children
in erotic poses and homosexual and sadomasochistic themes.

<HEAD>Strong Hole Develops Over Antarctica; Could Get Worse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists say a strong hole in the Earth's
ozone concentration in the stratosphere is developing over
Antarctica and could get worse as the South Polar winter continues.
   The ozone levels over Antarctica have been decreasing by about
1.5 percent per day through September, scientists at NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said Friday. A week before,
the ozone concentration had decreased by about 30 percent from the
beginning of the month, officials said.
   Dr. Arlin Krueger of NASA said the rate of decrease in ozone is
almost equal to the rate of decline in 1987 when a record ozone
depletion was observed on Oct. 5.
   ``The ultimate depth of this year's ozone hole will depend on
how long the current rate of decrease is maintained,'' said Kruger.
   Officials said a powerful polar vortex formed over Antarctica in
August, with extremely cold temperatures. These conditions are
ideal, according to current theory, for the formation of polar
stratospheric clouds, which are thought to increase the depletion
of ozone.
   Holes in the ozone above the Antarctic develop only during the
winter months when conditions are right. Depletions also have been
detected over the Arctic region during the cold season, but they
generally are less severe. Normal levels of ozone seem to restore
themselves with the change of season.
   Ozone in the stratosphere forms a protective layer against
ultraviolet rays from the sun. An excess exposure to UV radiation
is thought to be a major cause of skin cancer. Some studies also
have found that an increase in UV radiation also can harm many
plants and can depress the immune system in some animals, including
humans.
   NASA scientists have been monitoring ozone levels over the
southern hemisphere using an instrument on board the NIMBUS-7
satellite for more than 10 years.
   Earlier studies have indicated that stratospheric ozone can be
broken down through a chemical action initiated by some manmade
chemicals, principally cholorfluorocarbons. These compounds, called
CFCs, are used for refrigeration and for making some plastics
products.
   Some U.S. manufacturers and users of CFCs have announced plans
to stop making the chemical compound or to guard against releasing
the chemicals to the atmosphere.
   Ozone, a major component of smog, is an atmospheric pollutant at
ground level, but it forms an important part of the radiation
protection belt surrounding the Earth in the stratosphere, which
begins about 9{ miles above the Earth and extends upward to about
39 miles.
   Ozone is a substance composed of three atoms of oxygen. It is
created naturally during thunderstorms. Common atmospheric oxygen
is composed of two atoms.

<HEAD>FDA Raises Concerns About Grain Used in New Cereals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration wants two
companies to explain their claims that grain used in three new
breakfast cereal can help lower cholesterol.
   The FDA said Friday that it has ``serious concerns'' about the
amounts of grain General Mills and the Kellogg Co. are using in the
cereals and asked them to submit scientific data showing the levels
of grain are safe.
   General Mills makes Benefit cereal and Kellogg makes Heartwise
and Bran Buds.
   The cereals contain husks of psyllium, which contains soluble
fiber, which the companies say is safe and has been shown to help
reduce cholesterol. Benefit also contains sugar beet fiber, and the
FDA asked General Mills to submit data showing it also is safe.
   Spokesmen for both companies said their cereals are safe and
that they would submit the requested data.
   Bran Buds has been on the market for a year, Benefit is being
sold in selected test markets, but Heartwise is not on the market
yet.
   Proctor &amp; Gamble Co., which uses psyllium in its Metamucil
laxative, raised the question of whether psyllium is a drug or food
additive. The company had asked the FDA to pull Benefit off the
market because the cereal had not been subjected to drug-testing
requirements.
   Proctor &amp; Gamble had asked the FDA to let it make
cholesterol-lowering claims for Metamucil but was told more study
was needed. ``We hope the FDA will take further action to eliminate
the inconsistency in allowing these new cereals to make
cholesterol-reduction claims while Metamucil cannot,'' company
spokesman Bill Dobson said, reacting to the FDA's action.
   The FDA outlined its concerns in separate letters to General
Mills and Kellogg.
   ``We recognize that recent recommendations concerning diet
emphasizes the need for consumers to increase their intake of
fiber-containing foods,'' the FDA letters said. ``We generally see
no problem when this increase is accomplished by the consumption of
foods high in naturally occurring fiber.
   ``In the case of an ingredient that is intended to be added to
various food products to increase the levels of fiber in those
foods however, we believe there are some serious concerns that
should be considered first.''
   The FDA said there are ``well known safety concerns'' associated
with use of psyllium, including possible allergic reactions. The
agency noted that Geneal Mills has warned on its label about this
possibility, provides instructions for its use on the package label
and advises consuming the cereal with adequate liquids and
restricting consumption by children.

<HEAD>USDA: Farmers Selling Products for Less</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average prices farmers receive for their
raw products are continuing to decline from last year's record
heights, the Agriculture Department says.
   The department's price index hit an 11-month low in September,
falling 0.7 percent from August to leave the monthly average also
0.7 percent below the level a year ago, the USDA said in
preliminary figures released Friday.
   Lower prices for cattle, hogs and potatoes were mostly
responsible for the decrease from the August average, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report.
   Higher prices for oranges, milk, lettuce and applies partly
offset the decline for the other commodities during the month.
   ``Compared with a year earlier, lower prices for soybeans, corn,
tomatoes and oats more than offset higher prices for milk, cotton,
potatoes and eggs,'' the report said.
   Milk prices gained for the fourth consecutive month, winding up
in September at the highest level since February 1985.
   ``Feed grain prices were mixed, but corn, the major component of
this index, increased three cents (per bushel) from August,'' the
report said. ``An 18-cent (per bushel) decrease in the price of
soybeans moved the oil-bearing crop index lower.''
   No change was reported in the prices farmers pay to meet
expenses. Those are adjusted every three months, and the next will
be reported in October. The July ``prices paid'' index was up 0.6
percent from April and 3.5 percent from July 1988.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers _ gross
cash income minus cash expenses _ is expected to decline 5 percent
to 13 percent from last year's record of $59.9 billion.
   The 1988 drought forced commodity prices up, and many producers
were able to sell harvests at the higher prices, thus more than
offsetting reduced production. Also, many farmers had grain stored
from previous crops and were able to cash in as prices rose.
   Economists say the cash income decline this year is expected to
stem from farmers' larger cash expenses as they boost plantings,
and also because of lower federal subsidies.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA to rise an average of
5 percent to 7 percent this year, following a 4.1 percent increase
in 1988.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the September price index for
livestock and livestock products as a group decreased 1.9 percent
from August but averaged 3.3 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 0.8 percent from August but averaged
5.9 percent less than in September 1988.
   The all-fruit price index for September was up 22 percent from
August and was 6.4 percent above a year ago, the report said.
Rising prices for oranges had the greatest impact on the index,
followed by apples, peaches, strawberries, lemons and grapefruit.
   Prices of commercial vegetables dropped 10 percent from August,
averaging 16 percent below a year ago, the report said.
   The overall index of prices paid to farmers in September
averaged 143 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison, down from
144 percent in August. That was the lowest for the index since
October 1988.

<HEAD>Mubarak Urges Israel to Negotiate with PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, saying a
historic opportunity for peace in the Middle East is at hand,
called on Israel to open talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In an address Friday before the U.N. General Assembly, he also
urged Israel to swap territory captured in Mideast wars for peace.
   Israel has steadfastly refused to negotiate with the PLO,
calling it a terrorist organization dedicated to destruction of the
Jewish state.
   Mubarak called the PLO ``the sole, legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people.'' He said the organization had adopted
positive attitudes toward a peace settlement and ``deserves all
welcome and support from the international community.''
   In another major speech to the 159-member General Assembly
Friday, President Virgilio Barco of Colombia said drug barons are
at war with the world.
   He appealed to all nations to sign the Vienna Convention on
narcotics trafficking, which provides penalties for drug users and
dealers including seizure of ships on high seas and confiscation of
properties.
   ``A new world war is being waged by an aggressor unrestrained by
the traditional rules of engagement or by the responsibilities of
national sovereignty,'' Barco said.
   Barco is under death threats from Colombian cocaine cartels.
Security precautions for his U.N. appearance included sharpshooters
atop buildings, bomb-sniffing dogs and reinforced U.N. police.
   Barco said the demand for narcotics must be blocked.
   Those who consume cocaine are contributing to the assassination
of the Colombian people by criminals, he said. ``No doubt, somebody
a few blocks from this General Assembly hall, in one of this city's
fashionable neighborhoods, taking cocaine in the civilized calm of
his living room, would balk at this description.''
   He said that person is as guilty as the trigger men who have
murdered Colombian judges and policemen.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Friday that
Mubarak's peace plan for the Middle East is negotiable.
   ``The real question is what position the government of Israel
takes when the Cabinet meets next week,'' Baker told a news
conference at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.
   ``The Egyptian 10 points is not a competing proposal, it is
simply a method of trying to get implementation of the Shamir
proposal,'' Baker said.
   He referred to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his
right-wing Likud bloc.
   Likud rejects the concept of trading land for peace while its
uneasy partner in the coalition government, the center-left Labor
Party, has indicated it would accept some territorial concessions.
   In May, Shamir proposed elections among Palestinians to choose
representatives to negotiate with Israel for limited
self-government in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``The name of the game right now, it seems to me, is to ... get
Israelis and Palestinians talking to each other,'' Baker said.
   Mubarak offered to host preliminary Israeli-Palestinian talks in
Cairo to pave the way for Shamir's election plan.
   ``Letting the existing opportunity slip by will be a grievous
mistake exceeding all errors made in the past, which led to loss of
historic opportunities to contain the conflict and avoid its
aggression,'' Mubarak said.
   Egypt is the only Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel and Mubarak has been acting as a mediator, dealing primarily
with moderates in both the Arab and Israeli camps.

   A woman who said she was inspired by President
Bush's anti-drug speech received two years probation for setting
fire to a vacant trailer she believed was a crack house, a
prosecutor said.
   Jessie Mell Gross, 54, was sentenced to two years deferred
adjudication in connection with the Monday fire that destroyed the
trailer, prosecutor Kathy Braddock said Friday.
   Judge Jimmy James declined to fine Ms. Gross a $500 fine
requested by the prosecutor, Braddock said.
   Police had responded several times to complaints about fights
and disturbances at the trailer park, but only Ms. Gross complained
about alleged drug use at the vacant trailer, Ms. Braddock said.
Police weren't able to determine if the trailer was used as a crack
house.
   Ms. Braddock said that Ms. Gross told authorities she was
inspired to do something to stop drug use after watching Bush's
speech earlier this month.

   Twenty-four junior high school students in
Spanish Harlem received a promise from talk show host Geraldo
Rivera: Stay in school, and he'll pick up the tab for college.
   Rivera said Friday that he made the promise to a ninth-grade
class at Junior High School 45 ``to put them on a better course
than their buddies might have in the same neighborhood.''
   Rivera befriended the students last year through the Board of
Education's Adopt-A-Class program, in which companies and
individuals monitor and encourage students' development.
   He has provided book and clothing allowances so far, but admits
that sending the students to college ``could get pretty pricey,
especially if one of them goes to Harvard.''
   ``I feel one person can make a difference in the choices people
make,'' said Rivera, host of the syndicated show, ``Geraldo.''

   Actor David Carradine, perhaps best known as
the Buddhist monk in the hit 1970s television series ``Kung Fu,''
pleaded no contest to drunken driving, officials said.
   Municipal Court Commissioner David Stephens on Friday sentenced
Carradine, 52, to three years' summary probation, a 48-hour jail
term, 100 hours of community service and 30 days' work for the
California Department of Transportation, city attorney's spokesman
Ted Goldstein said.
   In addition, Carradine must attend a drunken driving awareness
meeting and complete a one-year alcohol rehabilitation program.
   Stephens imposed the harsh sentence because Carradine is a
second-time offender, Goldstein said.
   Carradine was arrested Sept. 8 after an officer noticed him
stopping repeatedly at green traffic lights, Goldstein said.

   A teacher is hoping for a
brief reunion with Mick Jagger after living with him in London 30
years ago.
   ``Well, I didn't actually live with him,'' Gillian Bloom said,
laughing. ``I lived as a boarder in his parents' house for about a
year.''
   Bloom remembers the then-16-year-old Jagger well. He played his
guitar in the garage at all hours, she said.
   ``I was 20 at the time and studying at Dartford College to be a
physical education teacher. Mick's parents were always telling him
to turn down the volume so I could study.
   ``Isn't that laughable? To think I might have killed Mick
Jagger's career by studying too much!''
   Bloom hopes to meet Jagger when the band performs at B.C. Place
Stadium in Vancouver Nov. 1 and 2.

   Luciano Pavarotti canceled six performances at
the Metropolitan Opera in January so he can be treated for sciatica.
   The opera superstar canceled his performances of Enzo in
Ponchielli's ``La Gioconda'' at the Met to undergo treatment of the
painful condition that affects the hip and thigh, the theater
announced Friday.
   Pavarotti will sing the Duke in a new Met production of Verdi's
``Rigoletto,'' with six performances in November and three in
February.
   On Aug. 31, Pavarotti canceled opening night of the Lyric Opera
of Chicago's season in September and five later performances as
Cavaradossi in Puccini's ``Tosca.''
   Ardis Krainik, general director of the Lyric, said Pavarotti
won't be invited back. He said Pavarotti had canceled 26 of his 41
scheduled appearances since 1981.
   Breslin said that cancellation also was due to Pavarotti's
sciatica.

   Former CIA and KGB spies agreed
after a remarkable meeting that one man's terrorist isn't another
man's freedom fighter, and called for a U.S.-Soviet effort to
combat ``morally reprehensible'' violence.
   ``Practical steps must be taken to combat the danger of
international terrorism and eliminate the conditions under which it
has operated with impunity,'' Lt. Gen. Fjodor Sherbak, former
deputy chief of the Soviet KGB's Second Directorate, said Friday at
the end of the weeklong conference.
   Ray Cline, deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency
from 1962 to 1966, agreed.
   ``We have a common interest in knocking this thing off. ... This
very dangerous phenomenon is tearing at the fabric of international
civilization,'' Cline said.
   The meeting of more than 20 members of the private U.S.-Soviet
Task Force to Prevent Terrorism was held behind closed doors at the
Rand Corp., a Santa Monica-based think tank.
   The group also included U.S. and Soviet academics and
journalists, as well as William Colby, a former CIA director, and
Maj. Gen. Valentin Zvezdenskov, former counterterrorism chief of
the KGB, the Soviet secret police and intelligence agency.
   Participants announced 30 recommendations they will pass to
their respective governments for future cooperation.
   ``We reached common ground that there are some forms of violence
that are absolutely unacceptable,'' said Augustus Richard Norton, a
professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.
   ``The old line that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom
fighter is absolutely wrong,'' he said. ``One man's terrorist is
another man's terrorist.''
   Cline said there are clear definitions of illegal terrorist acts
_ hijackings, the taking of hostages and bombings of planes, for
example.
   Such acts are ``wrong legally, and morally reprehensible,'' he
said.
   ``We recognize there is such a thing as acts of terrorism that
are directed against universal human values: international
relations, national sovereignty, and the greatest value of all,
human life,'' said Evgeny Ljakhov, an official of the Soviet
Ministry of the Interior, which is roughly equivalent to the U.S.
Justice Department.
   A complete list of the task force's recommendations was not
released because they are in draft form and many will be more
effective if they are privately conveyed to both governments, said
Brian Jenkins, a Rand Corp. expert on terrorism.
   But a news release and conference participants said they
included:
   _Expansion of existing U.S.-Soviet nuclear crisis control
centers to exchange information and deal with terrorist threats to
use biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons.
   _Increased cooperation to prevent and investigate airplane
bombings and aid the release of hostages held by terrorists,
particularly in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.
   _Agreement by both nations to refuse to train terrorists or
provide non-government groups with plastic explosives, nuclear
materials, surface-to-air missiles or other weapons useful to
terrorists.
   _Cooperation to restrict the laundering of drug money; to
exchange information on drug production, smuggling and distribution
in Latin America and Southwest Asia; and to explore providing
assistance to Peru, Colombia and other nations on the front lines
of the war against ``narcoterrorism.''
   _Joint efforts to restrict the ability of terrorists to cross
international borders and gain access to funds.
   _Greater cooperation in international law enforcement, including
a U.S.-Soviet agreement on extradition and prosecution of
terrorists.
   ``People are being killed every day,'' said Gleb Staroushenko of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He said the U.S. and Soviet
governments must take specific steps ``to eliminate the scourge of
terrorism.''
   The task force said that next year it wants to sponsor a joint
Soviet-U.S. exercise in which high-level officials of both nations
would participate in fighting a simulated terrorist crisis.
   The meeting was sponsored by Search for Common Ground, a
nonprofit public interest group in Washington, and by
Liternaturnaya Gazeta, one of the Soviet Union's largest
newspapers. The task force first met last January in Moscow.

<HEAD>Baker Tells Israelis, Congress of Tanks Deal With Saudis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration intends to sell 300
tanks to Saudi Arabia in a move certain to renew strong debate in
Congress over the sale of American arms to Arab countries.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III announced the plans
Friday, saying the administration will go ahead with it despite
Israeli objections.
   Baker said the administration, which has been trying to bolster
its ties to Arab countries it considers moderates, will still try
to find a basis for negotiations between Israel and Palestinian
Arabs.
   Israel registered its objections after Baker notified Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance
Minister Shimon Peres of the intended sale, Israeli Embassy
spokeswoman Ruth Yaron said in Washington.
   The deal could complicate U.S. negotiating efforts in the Middle
East and touch off a fight in Congress, which has the power to
block the Saudi purchase.
   U.S. arms sales to the Arab world usually raise security
concerns in Israel and among its congressional supporters. The
purchase would go through after formal notification unless a
majority of both the House and Senate voted to kill it.
   The tanks deal could be worth up to $1 billion depending on the
equipment included with the improved version of the M1A1 intended
for the Saudis.
   Congress over the years has turned back several U.S. arms sales
to Arab countries out of concern for Israel's security.
   Baker played a key and successful role as White House chief of
staff in 1981 when the Reagan administration's sale of advanced
radar surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia cleared the Senate by a
narrow vote.
   Pro-Israel lobbyists have shown little inclination lately of
confronting the White House on projected Arab arms sales. But the
purchase of modern tanks could set off alarm bells.
   Baker and his aides are arguing that the Saudis are politically
moderate and would purchase tanks from other Western countries if
they could not get them from the United States.
   But Mrs. Yaron said her government urged the administration not
to sell arms to Arab countries that are officially still at war
with Israel.
   Mrs. Yaron said that after the White House formally notifies
Congress, she was certain the House and Senate ``will consider the
element of security for Israel.''

   Senators say that failure to provide the money
to pay compensation to an estimated 60,000 Japanese-Americans
interned during World War II would amount to another act of
injustice.
   ``If we don't act, we will have committed another act of
incivility _ passing a law and then doing nothing,'' Sen. Pete V.
Domenici, D-N.M., said Friday in supporting a bill to waive budget
restrictions and grant the money for reparations.
   The Senate voted 74-22 to waive the budget restrictions, keeping
a promise made last year by making the compensation an entitlement
under law.
   Congress last year authorized reparations for Japanese-Americans
who had been interned during the war, but appropriated no money
because of the budget crunch.
   The $500 million reparations program will make $20,000 payments
available to each of the eligible Japanese-Americans at the
beginning of the 1991 fiscal year, Oct. 1, 1990.
   No funds are provided for fiscal 1990, which begins Sunday.
   Last year's legislation authorized $1.25 billion for the
payments, but limited the amount that could be appropriated in any
single year to $500 million.
   The reparations payments were made part of a pending $17.3
billion appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments, which was approved by voice vote. The money is not
included in the House bill, so House-Senate conferees will have to
work out the difference.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., tried to block the Senate action.
   ``We can't afford to make these payments,'' he said.
   ``Mistakes are made in every war,'' Helms said, dismissing
arguments that the United States must make the payments to correct
a mistake that harmed an entire class of U.S. citizens.
   But other senators said guaranteed compensation was essential to
rectify an injustice.
   ``There are times here when we deal with fiscal reality, but
there are also times when we have to set fiscal reality aside and
look at what is the right thing to do,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., one of the principal authors of the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction act.
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, who is of Japanese-American
descent, told the Senate he had only rarely spoken in behalf of
compensating the internees ``because of my own ethnic background.''
   However, he said that because of that reluctance, ``I may have
done many of those Japanese-Americans with whom I served in World
War II a great disservice,''
   Inouye lost his right arm in combat in Italy during service with
a Japanese-American infantry regiment and was awarded the
Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second highest award for
valor.
   He said many of the men in his unit came from families who were
detained in U.S. internment camps and who ``volunteered to defend
their country from behind barbed wire.''

<HEAD>Conference Committee Approves Compromise</HEAD>

   Lawmakers from the Northwest say a compromise
on logging in old-growth forests will protect the spotted owls that
live in the forests and satisfy lumber interests.
   ``We protected habitat and jobs,'' Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said
after a tense day of closed-door negotiations produced agreement in
a House-Senate conference committee Friday.
   ``I would say environmentalists came out with a pretty deal as
well as the workers in the timber community,'' said Sen. Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore.
   Both the House and Senate could act next week on the $11 billion
appropriations bill for the Interior Department and related
agencies that includes the compromise.
   Lawmakers have been searching for a way to ensure Northwest
mills of a steady supply of timber from the region's old-growth
forests while the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decides whether to
declare the northern spotted owl an endangered species.
   Such declarations require federal agencies to protect the
habitats of the species in question. The spotted owl lives almost
exclusively in old-growth forests and each pair requires a very
large area.
   The compromise provides that:
   _Federal timber sales in the region would be set at 9.6 billion
board feet over the next 12 months, about 1 billion board feet
below current levels.
   _The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management would be
required to ``minimize fragmentation of significant old-growth
forest stands'' and no sales would be allowed in areas already
identified as spotted owl habitat.
   _Court challenges to individual timber sales would be allowed,
but they would have to be filed within 15 days of the sale offering
and the courts would have to decide within 45 days.
   _Roughly half of the 2 billion board feet in sales currently
enjoined by federal courts would be released.
   Hatfield said the compromise would assure the industry of a
steady supply of timber over the next year by insulating it from
lawsuits and appeals which at one point had tied up half the sales
planned in the region during the current fiscal year.
   Jim Bloomquist of the Sierra Club said the compromise appeared
to be something environmentalists could accept. He cited a smaller
harvest, more protection for owls and virgin timber and elimination
of a Senate provision that would have imposed a 12-month ban on
federal court orders blocking timber sales.
   ``It is a positive response to many of the concerns we had with
the Senate legislation,'' Bloomquist said.
   While AuCoin, Hatfield and other members from the region
acknowledged the there still may be layoffs in the industry, they
said the legislation would minimize the economic damage to the
region.

   Shannon Chevrier hoped to get federal
aid to help cover the losses she suffered from Hurricane Hugo, but
instead she got a packet full of paperwork and was told it might be
two months before she saw any money.
   ``I expected something a little bit quicker,'' Miss Chevrier,
24, said Friday after visiting a Federal Emergency Management
Agency center set up to help hurricane victims.
   ``We don't need help two months from now. We need it right
away,'' she said. ``I'm out of work, I'm out of money. I'm angry.''
   The Charleston woman, one of hundreds of people who sought help
at one of five emergency centers, has not worked since the
hurricane hit Sept. 21. The bookkeeping firm that employs her has
been closed because the city is largely without power.
   She called the government response ``too little, too late. I
would expect in something like this the federal government would
respond quicker.''
   President Bush toured the storm-damaged areas for two hours
Friday, and acknowledged afterward that ``there's been a critic or
two'' of the federal relief effort. ``To the critics, I simply say:
I understand. We are trying very hard,'' he said.
   FEMA set up the centers to help residents apply for cash grants,
low-interest loans and jobless benefits. They can also seek answers
to questions about insurance claims, how to claim losses on tax
forms and register complaints about gouging.
   But for many, cutting through a tangle of government red tape is
just the latest hardship spawned by the storm that crashed into
Charleston with 135 mph winds.
   There have been complaints that there are too few centers and
that the process is too slow. The first centers did not open until
Thursday _ a full week after the storm hit.
   ``I thought they were kidding about the paperwork. It's
ridiculous,'' said Genie VanBenschoten, 26, holding a packet of
forms she needed to fill out and return.
   Those who came to one center Friday were given applications and
scheduled for an appointment. Some will not be seen until Oct. 10.
   ``Most of these people have lost everything. I feel for them but
this process is necessary,'' FEMA manager Shirley Caraway said.
   FEMA can provide loans of up to $100,000 to repair or replace
homes; up to $20,000 to replace personal property and up to
$500,000 for businesses.
   Also available are funds for temporary housing, rental
assistance and individual and family grants for needs not covered
by insurance.
   FEMA said 2,071 people had applied for federal aid at five
disaster relief centers in Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Sumter,
Myrtle Beach and Georgetown by Friday afternoon. Another 5,710 made
appointments to return next week.
   Five more centers were scheduled to open over the weekend in
Lancaster, Manning, Camden, Kingstree and Monck's Corner.
   Ron Ruffennach, a FEMA spokesman, said individuals' income is
used to determine whether they are awarded grants or low-interest
loans.
   One FEMA center is handling about 60 people every two hours and
officials said that by today they would handle 90 people within two
hours.
   Those who need immediate help are referred to the Red Cross or
Salvation Army, which have representatives at the center. The Red
Cross can issue vouchers for food, clothing, shelter, towels, soap
or other necessities.
   Some people expected immediate help from the government, but
FEMA officials said claims must be processed and verified before
taxpayers dollars are released.
   People filing emergency unemployment claims may wait for two to
three weeks. Officials would not say how long it might take for
small business loans to be forthcoming.
   ``You don't come in today and get a check tomorrow,'' said Jean
King, of the South Carolina Employment Security Commission.
   ``Rumors and misinformation have been rampant,'' said Kathryn
Kidd of the University of South Carolina Sociology Department, who
was assisting FEMA.
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. was an early critic of the
federal response.
   ``We really need more disaster assistance centers,'' Riley said.
``They were slow getting started, and I think that shows maybe some
weakness in the system.''

   The Soviets once called crime a product of
capitalism, meaning it wasn't their problem. Now, officials
acknowledge the Soviet Union has the fastest-growing crime rate in
the world and say they are alarmed.
   Lawbreaking was up 50 percent in some areas this year. To cope,
the KGB secret police has been enlisted to combat racketeering and
lawmakers endorsed an emergency anti-crime program.
   In crime increases,``lamentably, the Soviet Union is now No.
1,'' said Gennady V. Dashkov, an official at a Moscow-based
research institute affiliated with the state prosecutor's office.
   In the Central Russian city of Gorky, workers created vigilante
groups called ``workers militias'' to combat crime. In Moscow, new
French-built armored cars now pick up the day's receipts from large
stores and savings banks.
   Despite such measures, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the
Supreme Soviet legislature Monday that the increase in crime
continues.
   ``One cannot fail to see that although law enforcement bodies
have begun to operate more boldly and actively, and the public has
begun to support them more, it is too early to speak of a
turnaround,'' Gorbachev said. ``Crime is still on the rise.''
   Soviet newspapers are peppered with the litany of offenses: the
firebombing of a Moscow restaurant _ allegedly by racketeers _ bank
heists in Armenia and Moscow, and bands of roving toughs who beat
up well-dressed Muscovites.
   Soviet car owners have long removed windshield wipers to thwart
petty thieves, but drivers report brazen robbers now steal the
windshields themselves for resale on a black market in car parts.
   The crime wave is a shock to many, in part because the
government's long-time penchant for distorting or concealing the
seamy details of Soviet life makes public acknowledgement of any
problem the more startling.
   In addition, officials say the uncertainties and shifting social
and economic rules of Gorbachev's domestic reforms are a direct
cause of the growing crime problem.
   ``World practice shows that this situation is typical of any
society living through a transitional period,'' the nation's top
policeman, Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin, told the official
Soviet news agency, Tass, recently.
   Bakatin's deputy, Vasily Trushin, went on state television
earlier this month to tell people the problem is nationwide and
that crime is increasing in each of the country's 15 republics.
   In the first eight months of 1989, more than 1.5 million crimes
were reported in the Soviet Union, a 33.2 percent jump over the
same period last year, Trushin said.
   In the Baltic republics of Lithuania and Estonia, where crime
had been rare, reports of lawbreaking were up 50 percent, he said.
   Most worrisome to Soviets is the leap in ``grave crimes,''
including violent offenses such as murder, rape and robbery that
once were considered afflictions of the United States and other
Western societies.
   In the first eight months of 1989, ``grave crimes'' increased
40.8 percent, even faster than the overall Soviet crime rate,
Trushin said.
   He said crime statistics are influenced by other social forces,
which for years were contained by the police state but are being
vented in the less repressive climate instituted by Gorbachev.
Ethnic strife, for instance, has had a dramatic impact on crime
statistics.
   Trushin said that in one week in the Nagorno-Karabakh district,
scene of a long-running jurisdictional dispute between the
republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia, 16 attacks on cars were
registered, along with one murder, six cases of arson and 60 bodily
injuries.
   The official alarm about crime contrasts starkly with
Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy about the origins of illegal behavior.
   In 1987, two years after Gorbachev came to power, the Soviet
book ``Fundamentals of Criminalists'' declared, ``Having appeared
under exploitation of man by man, crime can be eliminated only
after doing away with exploitation. ...Hence in the U.S.S.R. there
are realistic objective conditions for eradicating crime.''
   Soviet criminologists have now discarded that thinking, perhaps
in part because the present rise in crime could imply that
Gorbachev's economic and political reforms permit more exploitation.
   ``A man kills his wife, say out of jealousy,'' Dashkov said in
an interview. ``That's going to exist under socialism just like
under capitalism.''
   Like Gorbachev, he and other researchers at the All-Union
Research Institute on the Problems of Strengthening Legality expect
the trend to continue.
   ``The rise will stop when Soviet people are certain that
tomorrow will be better than today, that they won't be unemployed
or without a place to live,'' Dashkov said.
   Two government periodicals squabbled last month over whether the
United States or the Soviet Union has a worse crime problem.
Interior Ministry Lt. Col. V. Prokopenko said statistics showed the
dubious honor still belongs to the Americans.
   There are only 5.9 murders per 100,000 Soviets, compared to 8.9
per 100,000 in America, Prokopenko told the official weekly
Arguments and Facts. He said there were 91,000 rapes in the United
States last year, or more than five times the 17,600 rapes reported
in the more populous Soviet Union.

   Boots, wallets and belts, the
conventional results of Florida's annual alligator hunt, have made
room for a more imaginative batch of byproducts ranging from
freeze-dried gator heads to gator spread.
   With the end of the second state-sanctioned alligator hunt
tonight, taxidermists, hunting stores and souvenir shops are trying
to outdo each other in providing an ever-widening array of gator
knickknacks.
   ``You would be amazed,'' said Ernie Santo of an Orlando shop

exclusive, and more and more popular.
   ``That's mainly because Florida and Louisiana are the only
places to get gators,'' Santo said. ``People love this stuff.''
   A popular item carried by Gatorland is the freeze-dried gator
head, which sells for $79.95.
   Just what anybody might want to do with such an off-beat item is
left up to customers' imagination.
   In Clewiston, the heart of the month-long hunt on the shores of
Lake Okeechobee, the Field and Stream shop has a gator-foot back
scratcher for $24.95, and the Skip Shop in Waldo offers key chains
made from gator toes for $9.95 apiece.
   State-licensed gator trapper Mike Rafferty says he couldn't keep
up with demand for gator bric-a-brac after last year's hunt.
   This year, he has expanded his product range.
   ``I've come out with a gourmet food line,'' he said. ``I've got
alligator spread, smoked alligator and alligator fritters.''
   Alligator meat, he explained, is low in fat and high in protein.
   ``They're good for you,'' Rafferty concluded.
   The booming business in alligator byproducts represents a
radical change for the reptile which only a few years ago was
considered a prime candidate for Florida's state animal.
   But in 1982, the Florida alligator lost out in that contest to
the endangered Florida panther. And while it remains against the
law to kill a panther, gators have become fair game for selected
hunters across the state every September.
   The principle reason for that turnaround is that the gators have
flourished under their protected status in recent years.
   ``They're a renewable resource,'' according to Lindsey Hord of
the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission in Okeechobee.
``And as long as they are, there's absolutely no sense in the
people of Florida not taking advantage of it.''
   ``It's my belief that's why (gators) were put here,'' Hord said,
``for us to use _ and people sure are using them.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Guerrillas Expect Complete Halt In Aid From Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   El Salvador's leftist guerrillas expect a
complete halt in aid from Nicaragua after last month's Central
American peace accords, but say they will maintain themselves as a
fighting force anyway.
   ``We expect the Nicaraguans to comply with the peace accords not
100 percent, but 101 percent,'' Miguel Saenz, of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front's political-military commission
said in an interview Friday.
   Nicaragua's President Daniel Ortega and the four other Central
American presidents signed a peace accord on Aug. 7 in which they
agreed that no irregular forces would be allowed to operate from
their territories.
   The accord also called for disbanding Nicaragua's U.S.-supported
Contra rebels in exchange for democratic elections and other
reforms inside Nicaragua.
   ``The Sandinistas have to abide by the accords they've signed.
They have a lot to gain,'' Saenz said.
   Saenz and Salvador Samayoa, another Front official, also said
they expected Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani to offer an
immediate, unconditional cease-fire when he speaks to the United
Nations General Assembly on Monday.
   They said a cease-fire in El Salvador was impossible without
agreement on measures to advance democracy and protect leftist
activists.
   ``If there are no guarantees, a cease-fire is a fiction,'' said
Salvador Samayoa, a member of the Front's political-diplomatic
commission. ``They will keep imprisoning our activists, there will
still be violence. It's all a kind of show.''
   The two officials said peace talks earlier this month in Mexico
City went well, and that they were optimistic about a second
session on Oct. 16 to 17 in Costa Rica, even though they felt
Cristiani's rightist government is stalling.
   ``They really believe we depend on the Nicaraguans,'' said
Samayoa. ``They figure if they stall the talks, time is on their
side, we'll get weaker and they'll win.''
   ``If they stick to that, we will have to show that their
analysis is wrong through more confrontation,'' Samayoa said. The
two officials noted that the Front launched an offensive this week
that has affected 10 of the nation's 14 provinces.
   Salvadoran guerrilla sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, have said there are 150,000 weapons available for
purchase in Central America, and that the guerrillas have the
resources to buy them.
   Among the sellers, these sources say, are the gradually
disbanding Contra guerrillas who have been fighting the Sandinista
government in Nicaragua since 1981.
   Samayoa said that even if the Front cannot win El Salvador's
10-year-old civil war militarily, that does not mean a victory for
the government.
   ``Supposing we can't win, we can guarantee they won't be able to
carry out their programs,'' said Samayoa. ``It's not just a
question of winning, but a question of governing and of
reactivating the economy.''
   The war in El Salvador has taken more than 70,000 lives and
wrecked the economy in the nation of 5 million, despite a total of
$3.8 billion in U.S. economic and military aid.
   In a peace proposal made in Mexico City, the rebels demanded
judicial reforms, an end to repression, maintenance of economic,
especially land, reforms made since 1980 and a cleansing and
shrinking of the army.
   They also asked for democratic constitutional reforms and
clearly defined cease-fire lines. In a notable change from previous
proposals, the guerrillas did not demand a power-sharing
arrangement in advance of a settlement.

<HEAD>Operation Rescue Leader Convicted on Charges Stemming From Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted the leader of the Operation
Rescue anti-abortion group of charges resulting from a protest at a
health clinic during last year's Democratic National Convention.
   Randall Terry was convicted Friday of criminal trespass and
unlawful assembly charges.
   The state then asked Judge John Bruner to impose the maximum
sentence of 12 months in prison and a fine of $1,000 for each of
the two counts. At Terry's request, though, the judge postponed
sentencing until Thursday.
   Terry, who remained free on a personal recognizance bond, told
reporters that the trial had ``been a classic example of a
miscarriage of justice ... a kangaroo court.''
   ``How could I expect justice in a court that protects
murderers?'' he added, a reference to repeated rulings from the
judge that abortion was not on trial.
   Chief Assistant Solicitor Robert Lee O'Brien, who prosecuted the
case, told Bruner after the verdict that Terry's conduct throughout
the trial led the state to believe ``he will continue engaging in
unlawful activities of this nature.''
   He urged the judge to impose the maximum combination of jail
time and fines, but said that if he intended to waive a jail
sentence, the judge should order that the fines collected before
allowing Terry to leave the court's jurisdiction.
   Terry appealed for a delay before sentencing ``to allow me time
to get my house in order.'' He promised to return, saying, ``I'm a
national leader. There's no place to run. I wouldn't want to run
anyway. It would be a disgrace to the cause.''
   In closing arguments, Terry _ who represented himself without a
lawyer _ said he was a would-be rescuer of unborn children. O'Brien
called him a man intent on pressing his own moral values on others.
   Terry is among 60 anti-abortion demonstrators on the trial in
Fulton County State Court, but only a handful are expected to be
tried in the next few weeks.
   More than 1,200 arrests were made during at least 20 protests at
various abortion clinics organized by Operation Rescue during the
summer and fall of 1988.

<HEAD>Army Frees Soldiers Convicted of Beating Palestinian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE OLSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three soldiers convicted in the beating of a
Palestinian were released early in a case viewed as a test of the
army's commitment to punishing troops who use brutality against the
Arab uprising.
   The Palestinian, Hani El-Shami, later died in a second beating
by other soldiers, a military court said. His case has been one of
the most contentious and publicized in the 21-month-old Palestinian
revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied lands.
   The government announced the pardon on Friday, just hours before
the start of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year. The soldiers, who
were sentenced to nine months for brutality, had three more months
to serve.
   Israeli liberals warned that releasing the three men could
encourage further abuse by soldiers faced with the task of putting
down the revolt.
   ``It's a sign to other soldiers that this act is not really so
bad,'' Yossi Sarid, a Parliament member from the leftist Citizens
Rights Movement Party, told Israel radio.
   Maj. Gen. Matal Vilnai, chief of the army's southern command,
cut the soldiers' sentences, resulting in their immediate release.
He barred them from returning to the elite Givati infantry brigade
in which they had served.
   ``The action is only a reduction of the actual prison time,'' an
army statement said. ``(Vilnai) does not erase the crime and the
conviction, which remain attributed to these soldiers.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who reportedly asked Vilnai to
cut the soldiers' sentences, told Israel radio that bad publicity
over the case had hurt army morale.
   The three men and a fourth soldier initially were charged with
manslaughter in the death of El-Shami, 42, who was beaten with
rifle butts and a broomstick at his home in the Gaza Strip's
Jabaliya refugee camp on Aug. 22, 1988.
   They were found innocent of the charge in May by a military
court, which ruled El-Shami died after a later beating by other
soldiers. The defendants were convicted of brutality, and no
charges have been brought against any other soldiers in the case.
   The fourth defendant was freed earlier after completing his
six-month sentence.
   The soldiers contended they were following orders.
   Also Friday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in a newspaper
interview that ``Israel can live with the intefadeh,'' the Arabic
word for the uprising that began in December 1987.
   Shamir told the Davar daily the government has not used all its
means to crush the revolt.
   ``If Israel is always convinced that it cannot compromise or
give in to these demands, it will continue to stand in this fight
and it can continue for a long time. We are stronger, they are the
sufferers,'' he said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Shefta Khalil Abu Tarr, 70, was
beaten to death in the town of Khan Yunis by fellow Arabs who
accused him of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab
reporters said.
   The killing brought to 122 the number of Arabs killed by other
Palestinians as suspected collaborators. Since the uprising began,
575 Arabs have been killed by Israeli soldiers or Jewish settlers
and 40 Israelis have been slain.

<HEAD>Beer Baron, Ballclub President August A. Busch Jr. Dead at 90</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   August A. Busch Jr., the beer baron and
baseball club president who was the city's best-known ambassador,
has died after a brief illness. He was 90.
   Busch died Friday at his home on Grant's Farm in suburban St.
Louis, according to a statement from his family.
   The patriarch of the world's largest brewing dynasty, Busch also
was remembered as St. Louis' biggest fan and a person who would
invite visitors into his home to have a beer and talk about his
team _ the St. Louis Cardinals. ``He was Mr. Anheuser-Busch, Mr.
Budweiser, Mr. Cardinal and he was Mr. St. Louis ... ,'' said Fred
Kuhlmann, chief operating officer of the Cardinals.
   Busch was hospitalized on Aug. 29 for routine tests and returned
home about two weeks ago. He had been suffering from pneumonia, but
his family declined to give the cause of death.
   Busch made Anheuser-Busch the brewing giant it is today, and he
built the Cardinals into one of baseball's most successful teams.
   At the time of his death, he was the honorary chairman of the
board of Anheuser-Busch, president and chief executive officer of
the Cardinals and a civic leader.
   At the start of each baseball season, Busch would ride atop the
Budweiser beer wagon around Busch Stadium by eight massive
Clydesdale horses.
   As the wagon emerged from the Cards bullpen with Gussie, as
Busch was called, waving a red cowboy hat, the organist would play
the Budweiser anthem, ``Here Comes the King.''
   ``We mourn his death while celebrating his many
accomplishments,'' baseball commissionier Fay Vincent said.
   In 1953, Busch convinced the company's board of directors that
it should purchase the team and renovate old Sportsmans Park.
   Later, when developers ran out of money for the new Busch
Stadium in downtown St. Louis, Busch helped raise the additional $3
million needed. The company now owns the stadium.
   ``He was clearly one of the legendary leaders of St. Louis,''
said Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. ``His vision and his drive that
resulted in bringing Busch Stadium into downtown St. Louis formed
the basis for three decades of growth in downtown St. Louis. He
will be sorely missed.''
   Busch took a small, ailing brewery in 1946 and turned it into
the world's largest by the time he retired in 1975.
   The brewery grew under his direction from producing three
million barrels of beer annually to a record 37 million barrels at
the time of his retirement. Last year, it produced 78.5 million
barrels, 38 million more than its nearest competitor.
   In 1922, he went to work for his father, August Anheuser Busch
Sr., cleaning vats and sweeping floors at the south-side brewery
started by his grandfather, Adolphus A. Busch, and Eberhard
Anheuser.
   Two years later, Busch was named general superintendent of
brewing operations just in time to face one of the company's
greatest crises _ Prohibition.
   Busch, his father and elder brother, Adolphus Busch III, kept
the company in operation despite the fact that its chief product
had been proclaimed illegal.
   The company diversified into other areas, producing yeast, corn
and salt syrup, refrigeration cabinets, soft drinks and car and
truck bodies.
   With the death of August A. Busch Sr. in 1934, control of the
company passed to his two sons. Adolphus Busch III died of cancer
in 1946 and Busch became president of the corporation.
   In 1957, Anheuser-Busch took first place among America's
brewers, a position it has held since.
   Busch, who was married four times, is survived by 10 children,
including August Busch III, current Anheuser-Busch chairman; a
sister; 27 grandchildren; nine great grandchildren; three nieces;
and two nephews.
   His fourth wife, Margaret Rohde Busch, died last year.
   Funeral services will be private and memorial arrangements are
pending.

<HEAD>Washington's Infant Mortality Rate Escalates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The infant mortality rate in the nation's
capital jumped nearly 50 percent during the first half of this year
because more babies were born to women addicted to cocaine, a
published report says.
   ``It is like a bomb has gone off,'' said an unidentified health
official who participated in a meeting on infant mortality with
Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry this week. ``No one in this
area knows what to do. I don't know what to do about social
pathology and decay in half the city.''
   Preliminary data that health officials presented to the mayor
shows that 169 infants died during the first six months of 1989,
sources told The Washington Post in a story published in today's
editions. That translates to an infant mortality rate of 32.3
deaths per 1,000 live births, triple the national average of 9.9
deaths per 1,000 in 1988 and highest in the country.
   The District of Columbia's infant mortality rate during 1988 was
23.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to the National Center
for Health Statistics.
   City officials predicted in January that infant mortality would
continue to rise because of the epidemic use of crack cocaine,
which causes the uterus to contract, cutting off oxygen and
inducing premature labor.
   Top private medical professionals asked Barry for more city
assistance in caring for babies abandoned in hospitals by
drug-addicted mothers, as well as help for the women themselves and
other children affected by illegal drugs.
   Health officials said the cutoff last year of congressional
funding for abortions in the city can be blamed for some of the
increase because many cocaine-addicted mothers continued
pregnancies they might have aborted.
   Before the funding cut, the city was paying for more than 3,000
abortions annually. The 1990 district budget recently approved by
Congress would restore the city's right to fund abortions, but
President Bush has threatened to veto the measure.
   ``We find the argument that abortion prevents infant mortality
incomprehensible,'' Douglas Johnson, a spokesman for the National
Right to Life Committee, said Friday. ``Abortion is infant
mortality.''
   The mayor declined to discuss the details of the meeting.
Participants included city Public Health Commissioner Reed V.
Tuckson, John Dandridge Jr., executive director of D.C. General
Hospital, and representatives of some of the district's private
hospitals.

<HEAD>Court Says Thornburgh Can't Challenge Secrecy Rulings</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: RECASTS lead to clarify.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will have to
take action to drop criminal charges against an Iran-Contra figure
if he wants to protect secrets from being disclosed at the man's
trial, according to an appeals court ruling.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Richmond, Va., on Friday rebuffed Thornburgh and said he could not
otherwise intervene to challenge secrecy rulings in the case
against Joseph F. Fernandez, a former CIA agent.
   The appeals court held that only independent counsel Lawrence E.
Walsh could appeal rulings allowing the disclosure of government
secrets in the trial.
   The court said Thornburgh's only recourse to protect the secrets
would be to exercise a politically unpalatable option the attorney
general had sought to avoid _ filing a motion that could lead to
the dismissal of charges.
   Thornburgh had sought to intervene to prevent the disclosure of
the location of CIA facilities in Central America that the trial
judge held could be made public as part of Fernandez's defense.
   The appellate panel said Thornburgh can still file an affidavit
blocking the release of the documents in open court, a move that
could force dismissal of the charges against Fernandez by U.S.
District Judge Claude Hilton of Alexandria, Va.
   The appellate court agreed with Walsh's contention that allowing
the attorney general to appeal secrecy rulings in the case would
undermine the independent counsel's ability to prosecute the case.
   ``We are, of course, gratified by their decision, and we will
proceed with the case,'' Walsh said in a statement.
   Thornburgh's spokesman, David Runkel, said, ``We're reviewing
the various options which the department has at this time.''
   Those options include seeking a rehearing of the case by the 4th
Circuit or appealing the ruling to the Supreme Court, Runkel said.
In addition, ``There is the option of discussing this with the
independent counsel to see if he could resolve the issue there,''
he said.
   Fernandez, who headed the CIA's station in San Jose, Costa Rica,
is accused of lying to agency superiors and a presidential
commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair about his role
in helping North set up a covert arms supply network for the
Nicaraguan Contras.

<HEAD>Feds Find No Evidence `Mystery Pilot' Involved In Drug, Gun Running</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug investigators found no
evidence that pilot Thomas Root was involved in drug smuggling or
gun running when his plane crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after a
mysterious 800-mile flight, a newspaper reported today.
   ``In view of his explanations, no further investigative efforts
will be generated by our office,'' Mario Perez, spokesman for the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Washington field office,
told the the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale reported in today's
editions.
   Perez on Friday said the DEA, the supervising agency for the
federal drug enforcement task force, decided to close the
investigation after Root was interviewed by a DEA agent Sept. 21.
   The investigation began two days before Root set out on his
odyssey July 13 that ended when his plane, flying on autopilot, ran
out of fuel and crashed in the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas.
   ``All of his answers were plausible,'' Perez said.
   Root's wife, Kathy, reached at the family's Alexandria, Va.,
home Friday, expressed relief that her husband had been cleared of
wrongdoing in the federal drug probe.
   ``We're certainly glad that what his friends and family knew to
be true all along has been determined to be the case by the federal
government,'' she said.
   She said her husband has never used drugs.
   Root was not available for comment. He underwent a second
operation around midday Friday in connection with the mysterious
gunshot wound he suffered to the abdomen during the flight.
   Also Friday, a National Transportation Safety Board official
said that his agency had concluded its investigation into Root's
crash. But Jorge Prelezzo, NTSB regional director for Florida and
the Caribbean, could not say when a final report would be completed
and made public.
   Paul Miller, spokesman for the Miami field office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, said the FBI is continuing to pursue its
11-week-old probe into Root's activities in the days preceeding his
flight.
   The FBI inquiry began after doctors treating Root at Hollywood
Memorial Hospital following his rescue discovered he had been shot.
Root, 36, says he became ill and blacked out about an hour after
leaving Washington National Airport July 13, and does not know how
he suffered the gunshot wound.
   Two days before Root set out on his flight, the multi-agency
task force of federal, state and local law enforcement officials
discussed opening up an investigation on Root, based on a search
April 24 of his airplane hangar. That search resulted from a tip
that Root had stored a cache of drugs, guns and drug paraphernalia
in his hangar.
   But the search turned up no drugs, and all of the guns seized in
the search had federal or state licenses.

<HEAD>HUD Says No To Cleveland Grant For Rock 'N' Roll Hall Of Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has rejected
Cleveland's request for $6.9 million to help build a Rock 'N' Roll
Hall of Fame, but city officials say it's too soon to declare an
end to its music fantasy.
   Development officials Greg Shumate and Chris Johnson say they'll
quickly review funding commitments _ including those dependent on
the Urban Development Action Grant, or UDAG, request rejected
Friday _ and ask backers to stay behind the $48 million project.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, called the Department of Housing
and Urban Development's decision the result of a misunderstanding.
   ``There's so little money to go around they're not going to give
you the UDAG if they think you can raise the money nationally,''
she said. ``But the (Rock 'N' Roll Foundation) board in New York
said none of the construction money could be raised nationally.
   ``They didn't understand that at HUD,'' she said.
   Cleveland, where late-night disc jockey Alan Freed introduced a
generation of teeny-boppers to the music of Fats Domino and the
term rock 'n' roll, beat out other aggressive contenders to win the
right to build the hall of fame.
   But the designation came with strings attached, including a
requirement that the city line up $40 million in construction money
by Nov. 15, 1989.

<NOTE>Food Stamp Recipients Get Cost-of-Living Hikes</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of low-income families that use
government food stamps will get cost-of-living increases beginning
Oct. 1, the Agriculture Department says.
   Ann Chadwick, acting assistant secretary for food and consumer
services, Friday said the monthly food stamp allowance will be
increased about 10 percent. Also, she said, income eligibility
levels will go up abut 4 percent, meaning a family can have more
income and still qualify.
   Department budget officials estimate that more than 18 million
people share in the program, which is estimated to cost around $13
billion a year.
   Eligible people get the monthly coupons free of charge and can
exchange them like cash at grocery stores.
   Chadwick said the increase will boost the monthly allocation for
a family of four to $331 per month from the current level of $300
per month.
   Gross income levels, which help determine eligibility for
households that do not include an elderly or disabled member, will
be raised to $1,311 per month for a family of four from the current
$1,263.

<NOTE>China Resumes Subsidized Wheat Purchases</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought U.S. wheat under a price
subsidy program for the first time in almost six months, the
Agriculture Department says.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Friday that five private
exporting companies made the deals for a total of 270,000 metric
tons under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Dickerson said the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized
to China under the program last Feb. 27. Beijing used about 1.1
million tons of the new authorization and then switched to straight
commercial deals for U.S. wheat.
   After the deals reported Friday, China will have 640,000 tons
remaining to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 9.9 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by the department at $3.68 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $36 million.
   Under the Export Enhancement Program, private exporters can sell
U.S. commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $10.95 per ton, or
about 30 cents per bushel.

   South Carolina desperately needs to
build 65 miles of protective sand dunes in just over two weeks to
prevent further damage to a coastline already devastated by
Hurricane Hugo, Gov. Carroll Campbell said.
   ``If we don't do this now, I'm afraid we're going to forego the
coast,'' Campbell said Friday. ``It's mind-boggling, but we can do
it.''
   The state faces a race to beat a once-in-a-decade high tide that
begins in mid-October. The high tide is expected to cause more
beach erosion and further damage to already fragile structures
along the coast.
   Carroll and legislative leaders discussed the coastal plan after
President Bush brought sympathy and part of a $1.1 billion federal
aid package during a two-hour tour of storm-damaged areas.
   Bush bypassed Charleston and toured the suburb of Summerville by
car, seeing decimated trailer parks, dozens of roofless buildings
smashed cars pine forests mowed down by Hugo's winds. Later, he
rode a helicopter over the coastline and over some of the hardest
hit areas of downtown Charleston.
   The hurricane ``was tough. It was devastating,'' Bush told
reporters.
   ``But the spirit of the people of South Carolina came through
loud and clear,'' he said. ``You couldn't help but be impressed to
hear people say, `We're going to bounce back.'''
   The president acknowledged that many residents have criticized
the federal government's relief effort as too slow, but said, ``We
are trying very hard.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush directed the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to open four more
disaster-relief offices in Charleston. Mayor Joseph Riley had
criticized FEMA for having only two offices in the city.
   Of the $1.1 billion in Hugo-related emergency assistance Bush
signed shortly before arriving, $200 million will go to South
Carolina.
   The governor said he discussed the dune project with Bush.
Federal funds would cover three-fourths of the $65 million needed
for the project.
   From Oct. 14-17 and again from Nov. 12-15, daily high tides will
be more than 7 feet above the average low tide level, or 2 feet
higher than usual. That's because the moon is making its closest
approach to the Earth in years.
   ``The world thinks our coast is gone. That's what they see on
television. We've got to restore the beach and get it up for next
summer,'' Campbell said.
   If the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Carolina
Coastal Council say the project is feasible, ``We're going to
launch it right away,'' Campbell said. Much of the work could be
done by 2,000 members of two U.S. Army engineer battalions in South
Carolina, he added.
   The state Department of Corrections, meanwhile, turned down an
appeal from soul singer James Brown to be released from prison to
give a benefit concert to raise money for relief efforts,
corrections spokesman Francis X. Archibald said Friday.
   ``I simply want to do what I can to help restore these people's
lives, feed the hungry and house the homeless,'' Brown said in the
statement issued from the State Park Correctional Facility near
Columbia, S.C., where he is serving a six-year sentence for
aggravated assault and failing to stop for police.
   Offers of food and supplies continued to flood in from around
the country, meanwhile, and Charleston cut back its curfew by two
hours a day, leaving it in effect from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Co. said 2,000 workers from 33
power companies in nine states were helping to restore power. But
nine days after the storm hit, about 200,000 residents remained
without power, about half of them in Charleston.

   When Mark Metzger asked Janet Egelston
to marry him, he never thought he'd have to get the blessing of the
state Legislature.
   But the two partners in a brewery and restaurant found out that
marriage could be the end of a beautiful business relationship
thanks to a state law dating back to the end of Prohibition.
   ``You could never imagine, I mean it would never enter your head
that when you wanted to get married it would put your whole
business and your future in jeopardy, but it did,'' Metzger said.
   The couple, co-owners of The Northampton Brewery, got engaged
more than two years ago. Then they discovered that if they got
married they'd have to give up their brewery and restaurant
business because of a state law forbidding joint ownership of a
beer manufacturer's permit and a pouring license.
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Tuesday signed into law a special
bill allowing Metzger and Egelston to get married and keep their
business.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Metzger said Friday.
   Metzger and Egelston, who plan to get married July 7, said
they've been so busy running the business they haven't had time to
worry about the situation.
   ``Some people said we had the best of both worlds,'' Metzger
joked. ``We wanted to be married but we couldn't.''

   No offense, but one of the more popular
candidates for homecoming king at the University of North Texas is
a real dog. And a well-liked nominee for queen is a little
squirrely.
   But because they don't have good grades, they will never get a
chance to strut on the homecoming court.
   Hector the mascot dalmatian dog and Agnes, a popular squirrel
who hangs out by the physics building, were among the candidates
for college royalty when students went to the polls Tuesday and
Wednesday. Ten men and nine women also were in the running.
   But the animals were disqualified because candidates must
maintain a 2.5 grade-point average.
   Student Association member Wade Duchene, Hector's campaign
manager, has not given up.
   ``They didn't notify Hector and Agnes in person, and Hector and
Agnes were not given the chance to defend themselves,'' Duchene
told the North Texas Daily student newspaper. ``Hector's very
dogged about this.''
   The king and queen will be crowned during halftime of the Oct.
14 football game between North Texas and Stephen F. Austin. The
winners have not been announced.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor, convicted of battery
for slapping a police officer and two other misdemeanor charges,
said her fame and outspoken self-defense led to the verdict _ which
she called ``ridiculous.''
   ``I know it's Zsa Zsa Gabor _ the diamonds. She loves to talk
up, she's not a milquetoast,'' said the actress, whose courtroom
outbursts and often outrageous out-of-court commentary on such
topics as police brutality and lesbianism had attracted news media
from around the world.
   The jury returned guilty verdicts Friday against Miss Gabor on
charges she slapped a motorcycle officer during a traffic stop and
was driving without a valid driver's license and with an open
container of alcohol in her car.
   The Hungarian-born star of such movies as ``Queen of Outer
Space'' and ``Picture Mommy Dead'' was acquitted on a fourth count
of disobeying Beverly Hills police Officer Paul Kramer as she drove
away while he was still checking her motor vehicle record on June
14.
   ``I can't believe in a country as great as ours that a 6-foot-4
policeman can beat up a lady of 5-foot-4, uses dirty language like
you were a streetwalker. ... I think Russia can't be worse than
this, or Communist Hungary either. I think it's ridiculous.''
   But juror Kevin Goodman, a 29-year-old Los Angeles attorney,
said, ``We felt a lot of weight as jurors in coming to the right
decision. We weren't in a deal-striking mood. There was no
compromise.''
   Municipal Court Judge Charles Rubin, who tried to limit
publicity by imposing what Miss Gabor called a ``gagging order,''
commended the jury for its work and hailed the trial as a model of
American justice.
   The trial was scheduled for one week, but took three.
   Miss Gabor, who claims to be 66 years old, faces up to 18 months
and five days in jail and a fine of $3,500. Sentencing was set for
Oct. 17.
   Rubin also fined Miss Gabor $500 for violating his gag order by
telling reporters that Kramer's fellow officer, Scott Thompson, had
lied on the witness stand while testifying for the prosecution.
   Thompson was called to buttress Kramer's account of the
incident, which began after he pulled Miss Gabor over for expired
registration tags on her white Rolls-Royce Corniche. As he checked
for other violations, she drove off.
   Miss Gabor admitted she slapped the officer after he stopped her
a second time. She said she reacted in self-defense when he pulled
her from her car, but he said the attack was unprovoked.
   The actress dismissed the possibility Friday that she would be
incarcerated.
   Prosecutor Eldon Fox also said he would not recommend the
actress be jailed. He said he would ask that Miss Gabor be ordered
to pay Los Angeles County for the cost of her trial, estimated at
$30,000.
   ``I want the $30,000 restitution to the court for this media
circus,'' he said.
   The star often arrived for the trial in the $215,000 Rolls that
had caused her so much trouble in the first place. On the first
day, she brought her hairdresser with her.
   At one point she told throngs of reporters her mother feared she
might be sent to jail, adding, ``Besides, they are all lesbians in
jail. And I'm so scared of lesbians. Can you imagine being in jail
with all those women?''
   She later apologized for the remark.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was hope that 2,600 East Germans
confined to Bonn's embassy in Czechoslovakia might be allowed to
live in more tolerable conditions until they can flee to the West,
the government said.
   But there were no indications that they and 600 other East
German refugees waiting in Bonn's embassy in Warsaw, Poland would
be given permission to emigrate any time soon.
   ``The West German government, encouraged by the recent
expressions of the Prague government, expects at least a bearable
compromise in the humane interests of those involved,'' Klein said.
   He referred to prospects for alternative housing in Prague but
declined to give details, ``in order not to damage these very
difficult negotiations.''
   Since Sept. 10, more than 23,000 East Germans have fled to the
West through Hungary after that East bloc country opened its border
to Austria. West Germany offers automatic citizenship to East
Germans.
   But Czechoslovakia has said it will not allow the same kind of
mass migration westward. Poland has pressed the two Germanys to
work out a solution rather than following Hungary's action, which
has stirred conflict in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski said Friday that
a solution to the refugee situation in Warsaw could come ``very
soon.''
   He talked to reporters after meeting with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher in New York, where both were
attending the U.N. General Assembly session.
   Health conditions have deteriorated at the embassy in Prague,
where refugees sleep three to a cot in tents jamming the muddy
compound. Many refugees, including hundreds of children, are
suffering from colds, flu and other weather-related illnesses.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher said no serious
infections were reported yet, but swift measures were needed.
   Klein said pictures of the embassy grounds appearing worldwide
testified to the ``human tragedy'' of thousands of East Germans
driven to flee by the hard-line leadership in East Berlin that has
rejected calls for reform.
   More than 100,000 East Germans have fled to West Germany so far
this year.
   Botho Sayn-Wittgenstein, president of the West German Red Cross,
returned from Prague on Friday. He said authorities were showing
willingness to deal with the crisis in a humanitarian spirit.
   Prague is considering an appeal to house refugees in other
buildings.
   Prague government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said the embassy
situation ``has slowly become a problem of public order in the
Czechoslovak capital.''
   ``We cannot overdramatize or build refugee camps while awaiting
other resolutions,'' Pavel said. But he said emergency shelter was
being considered.
   The more liberal Polish government has allowed East Germans in
Warsaw to move about the city freely.
   East Berlin lawyer Wolfgang Vogel visited Prague and Warsaw this
week and offered assurances the refugees could emigrate later if
they first returned to East Germany. But fewer than 10 percent of
refugees took up his offer.
   East Germans need no special permission to visit Prague, and
would-be emigrants _ disillusioned with widespread shortages and
harsh restrictions on travel and free expression _ appealed to the
West German Embassy to help them.
   West German border authorities said 447 more East Germans
arrived in southern Bavaria state in the 24 hours before Friday
noon, and 200 to 300 register daily in Budapest for travel to West
Germany.
   The number of refugees in Warsaw rose from 400 to 600 in one
day. Many have risked daring escapes across the Oder and Neisse
rivers.

<HEAD>Bakker: God Gave Him Vision Of Retreat</HEAD>

   Jim Bakker testified that his dream of a
Christian retreat was a vision from God, but the demands of fund
raising turned it into a nightmare.
   ``In the middle of the night I woke up,'' Bakker said Friday in
his first day on the witness stand for his fraud trial. ``It was a
vision or a dream, I don't know. God gave me the concept of the
Heritage Grand Partner Center and I began to sketch it.''
   The PTL founder said his biggest burden was raising funds to
build the Heritage USA retreat and theme park near Fort Mill, S.C.,
but he denied overselling partnerships in the project.
   Prosecutor Deborah Smith asked Bakker why he told television
viewers in 1984 that 50 percent of the 25,000 partnerships at the
Heritage Grand Hotel were taken when computer records showed fewer
than 4,000 had been bought.
   ``You were creating a false sense of urgency, weren't you, Mr.
Bakker?'' Ms. Smith asked.
   Bakker said PTL's computers typically ran six months behind,
adding: ``If you believe the computer records of Heritage USA, I
could sell you land under water in Florida.''
   Bakker is accused of fleecing followers of $158 million by
overselling ``lifetime partnerships'' at the ministry. The $1,000
partnerships entitled bearers to three nights lodging annually in
PTL facilities.
   Defense attorneys have claimed that the partnerships were not
sales transactions and that the money paid for them were gifts to
the ministry.
   Earlier in the trial, the prosecution presented several PTL
partners who said they sometimes were turned away when they tried
to use their lodging benefits. Prosecutors contend Bakker pocketed
$3.7 million of proceeds to fund his lavish lifestyle.
   On Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter said Bakker
did not have proof to back up his calculations that there was room
for 211,062 lifetime partners. The judge refused to allow a chart
displaying the calculations to be presented to the jury.
   Bakker faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than $5
million if found guilty on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
   The evangelist often responded to prosecutors' questions by
saying he could not recall, had not been informed or that he
believed what he told television viewers.
   When Bakker said he could not recall getting a $50,000 Christmas
bonus in 1986, Smith said, ``Had your lifestyle become so
extravagant that you wouldn't have noticed a $50,000 bonus?''
   ``I did not look at my checkbook for several years,'' Bakker
said.
   Bakker also testified that fund raising at the ministry became a
nightmare.
   ``I think fund raising was my most burdensome job,'' he said.
   ``It never left me. You never ever, ever get away from the
pressure that you have to raise funds for next week, next month,
next year,'' he said.
   Bakker, who was briefly hospitalized during the trial after he
was reported to be suffering from hallucinations, took the stand
after his lawyers had presented more than 70 witnesses in his
defense.
   Neither his wife, Tammy Faye, nor his two children were in the
courtroom.
   In a low voice, Bakker described the roots of his PTL ministry,
which he resigned in a sex and money scandal in 1987. He then
described his vision to build the 2,400-acre Heritage USA.
   Bakker testified that he ``had confidence in God'' to supply
money for Heritage USA. When he left PTL, he said, the ministry's
budget was $160 million a year, ``which I think boils down to $3
million a week.''
   He also described his supervision of PTL's television network,
the Inspirational Network. ``When I left PTL, it was the largest
Christian network in the world,'' he said.
   ``TV is the most powerful medium in the world today,'' he said
at another point. ``I felt the message of Jesus Christ should be
propagated over that medium.''

   In all of Zsa Zsa Gabor's roles,
from the movie ``Queen of Outer Space'' to TV's ``Merv Griffin
Show,'' nothing quite compared to the performance she delivered in
her cop-slapping trial.
   At times indignant, other times irrational, the temperamental
Hungarian actress' theatrics riveted crowds of reporters for 15
days.
   In the end, though, her courtroom dramatics didn't convince the
jury of her innocence. Miss Gabor was convicted of three of four
misdemeanor counts on Friday.
   From the start _ her curbside arrest and handcuffing on June 14
for slapping motorcycle policeman Paul Kramer _ Miss Gabor couldn't
believe she would be treated like common folk instead of the
``princess'' she insisted she was.
   After all, she said, she's a Hollywood glamor queen, actress and
housewife.
   When she struck Kramer in the slap heard round the world, she
asked, ``Who do you think you are?'' Kramer responded, ``Who do you
think YOU are?''
   ``I am the daughter of a freedom fighter,'' the flamboyant
actress told reporters during her trial. ``I am a horsewoman,'' she
frequently intoned. ``I am a princess. I am Zsa Zsa.''
   ``Every Girl Should Have One'' in 1978 was Zsa Zsa's last film
role. Other movie credits include ``Moulin Rouge,'' ``Boys Night
Out'' and ``Picture Mommy Dead.''
   Television viewers are familiar with Miss Gabor's frequent talk
show appearances, as one of the celebrity squares on ``Hollywood
Squares'' and on ``The Munsters'' reruns. She'll be on this
season's first episode of ``The Munsters Today.''
   Miss Gabor, believed older than the 66 she claims, has a
cosmetics and jewelry business, commands about $5,000 for her TV
appearances and has extensive real estate holdings.
   She pulled out all the stops throughout her trial, drawn to
microphones as if they were diamonds.
   She blasted the prosecutor's ``Napoleon complex,'' insulted gays
and lesbians, dismissed witnesses as punks or drug users, and
pulled courtroom antics that ranged from sobs and laughter to
stomping out of court in a huff.
   Among the highlights:
   _After Deputy District Attorney Elden Fox characterized Miss
Gabor as a spoiled aristocrat who didn't know the meaning of truth,
Miss Gabor burst into tears and left the courtroom. The actress
said she was going to Europe.
   _When the jury began deliberations, the prosecutor said he was
offended by the behavior of the media. Reporters converged daily on
the unpredictable Miss Gabor for her latest observation.
   ``It did bother me,'' Fox said. ``It's sort of like an unsavory
symbiotic relationship between the media and the defendant in this
case. It's sort of like they feed on each other.''
   _Miss Gabor said in the first week of her trial that she was
afraid to go to jail because jails are filled with lesbians. The
controversy lingered throughout the trial, with Miss Gabor
attempting to clarify the remark and insisting she didn't mean to
offend gays.
   _She also talked often about ``that gorgeous'' officer, Kramer,
but didn't conceal her dislike for him.
   ``He's a vulgar policeman and he's a liar,'' she said. ``I
should have scratched his eyes out. I think that cop is not too
bright. I think he must be very spoiled because he's very sexy.
He's gorgeous. He's sexy, but I don't like that man.''
   _Kramer was hospitalized during the trial after crashing his
motorcycle into a police car while chasing suspects through Beverly
Hills. Miss Gabor suggested the crash was a staged sympathy ploy.
   _Miss Gabor's husband, who told a reporter it would be OK to
call him prince or Freddy, got into a spat with the actress over
her constant reference to Kramer as gorgeous. Miss Gabor slapped
her husband-prince and broke his glasses.
   ``German men love to suffer,'' she said.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts Five in `Skinhead' Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Justice Department officials say grand jury
indictments of five reputed members of a neo-Nazi ``skinhead''
group are a warning that lawmen are giving highest priority to
crushing crimes of hatred.
   The indictments involved allegations of vandalism at a Jewish
temple and the Jewish Community Center in Dallas, and attacks
against blacks and Hispanics at Robert E. Lee Park. The alleged
attacks occured last summer and fall, officials said.
   James P. Turner, acting assistant attorney general in the
Justice Department's civil rights division in Washington, announced
the indictments on Friday. Four of the five men are in custody,
federal authorities said.
   The five belong to a Dallas-based group called the Confederate
Hammerskins, officials said.
   The skinhead subculture emerged in London in the 1960s. Segments
of the movement took on Nazi overtones in 1985 and since have been
supported by and associated with the white supremacist Aryan Youth
Movement and White Aryan Resistance.
   ``These indictments involve interference with basic civil rights
because of a person's race, religion, national origin or ethnic
background,'' Turner said. ``Racial hate crimes are crimes against
the very idea of American freedom and democracy.''
   Turner added that ``President Bush and Attorney General (Dick)
Thornburgh have made it clear that these prosecutions of this type
rank right up there with the war on drugs as a federal law
enforcement priority.''
   The indictments bring to 16 the number of Confederate
Hammerskins associates charged in the grand jury investigation that
began in February following months of hate crimes in north Texas
and surrounding areas. Seven have pleaded guilty to charges in
connection with violence last summer and fall.
   The white supremacy group first appeared in Dallas less than two
years ago when Sean Christian Tarrant, one of the defendants,
formed the Hammerskins.
   The three-count indictment names Tarrant, Jon Lance Jordan,
Michael Lewis Lawrence, Christopher Barry Greer and Daniel Alvis
Wood. It alleged two separate conspiracies to commit acts of
violence.
   Each of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of 10 years
imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
   Lawrence, Jordan and Wood also were charged with using a firearm
in a violent crime.
   Jordan remained at large Saturday, said Barry Kowalski, an
attorney with the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Mark Briskman, Dallas regional director of the B'nai B'rith
Anti-Defamation League, said he believes that the federal
prosecutions ``will drive a stake into the heart of the vampire.''
   ``I think that this sends a very clear message to bigots and the
organized hate community that these kinds of activities are not
going to be tolerated,'' he said.

<HEAD>Followers Brace for Another Saga: Where to Bury Marcos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINE DONNELLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of Ferdinand E. Marcos was expected to
be the end of a saga for his followers, but they say it's turning
into the beginning of another one _ when and where he'll be buried.
   ``President Marcos' death is not the end of the story for me,''
said aide Arturo Aruiza, a colonel in the Philippine Army who
advised Marcos for more than 20 years. ``My job is with the
president. Now I must stay with his body.''
   Long before the chronically ill former Philippines president
died of cardiac arrest Thursday at the age of 72, the 20 or so
members of his staff were pondering life without him.
   Some, such as Aruiza, hoped to return to the Philippines. Others
are seeking residency in the United States or staying on with
Marcos' widow, Imelda.
   But now, with the fate of Marcos' body uncertain, many employees
said they had put their plans on hold.
   ``What will I do? I'll wait for my appeal,'' said spokesman
Leoni Tan, who has appealed an immigration judge's denial of his
request for political asylum here. ``It looks like I'll have plenty
to do for Ma`am,'' he said, referring to Mrs. Marcos.
   Marcos' corpse has been lying in a bronze casket in the living
room of the family home since Thursday. Hundreds of people have
viewed the body, with the novena to continue through Friday.
   There are no plans for burial. Mrs. Marcos says it's the only
way to ensure it would return to the Philippines if the opportunity
arises.
   ``My plan has always been to bring him back,'' she said. ``I
have committed myself to what is Ferdinand's right to rest in peace
in his motherland.''
   Initially, President Corazon Aquino said Marcos' return _ even
dead _ could destabilize the administration she's headed since a
popular revolt ousted Marcos in 1986.
   But later, Mrs. Aquino softened her rhetoric slightly, saying
she might consider the return later if political conditions were
right. She also said she might consider allowing Mrs. Marcos and
her three children to return.
   ``There is nothing that would prohibit the temporary display of
a body in a private home if it does not create a health hazard or a
nuisance,'' Hawaii Attorney General Warren Price said. A court
ruling might be required to define ``temporary,'' he added.
   Neighbors in the usually tranquil neighborhood of Makiki Heights
hope Marcos is buried _ somewhere _ soon.
   ``We don't mind an appropriate memorial service. Two weeks is
fine, two years is too long,'' said John Steelquist, chairman of
the neighborhood board.
   Steelquist said the neighborhood was worried Marcos' would end
up like his mother, Dona Josefa Edralin, who died in the
Philippines in May 1988 but has never been buried because Marcos
could not return to preside over the funeral.
   Several pro-Marcos Filipino arrived Friday to pay their
respects. Others, such as Joan Still, a tourist from Cleveland,
Tenn., visited ``out of curiosity.''
   ``Mrs. Marcos was very warm, I offered my prayers and she
thanked me for coming,'' Mrs. Still said. ``I feel like he did
wrong, but maybe he asked God to forgive him.''
   In the Philippines, officials said Marcos' death might encourage
his family and former associates to settle claims made by the
Philippine government out of court to avoid costly legal battles.
   Marcos attorney John Bartko said the family remains anxious to
resolve the dispute, since it could allow their return to the
Philippines. However, he said there were no plea bargaining talks
taking place regarding Mrs. Marcos' U.S. criminal case.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent in a New York court to federal
racketeering charges alleging she and her husband stole nearly $200
million from their impoverished country and stashed it in the
United States.
   A lawyer for the Philippines said a $5 billion civil fraud and
racketeering lawsuit brought against Marcos in Los Angeles would go
forward.

<HEAD>Romania Urged Defending Socialism When Solidarity Premier Nominated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hours after President Wojciech Jaruzelski
nominated the East bloc's first non-communist prime minister,
Romania's leader proposed Warsaw Pact action aimed at ``defending
socialism,'' documents show.
   The documents, published Friday in the Polish press, said
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu summoned Poland's ambassador
at midnight Aug. 19 and told him: ``As a Communist Party, a
socialist country, we cannot consider this an internal affair of
Poland alone.''
   In a response sent to Romania after the meeting, the Polish
Communist Party rejected Romania's protest as ``unfounded'' and an
``unjustified attempt at undermining our country's credibility as
an ally,'' a document said.
   Two documents, one appearing to be a Polish diplomatic report
about the incident and the second, the response of the communist
Polish United Workers Party, were published by the pro-Solidarity
Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. They were picked up by the Polish news
agency PAP.
   Poland's Communist Party criticized publication of the documents.
   On Aug. 19, Jaruzelski nominated Solidarity journalist Tadeusz
Mazowiecki as prime minister. Czeslaw Kiszczak had resigned from
the post after a futile three-week effort to form a communist-led
government.
   ``Making it possible for Solidarity to come to power is
discordant with the scientific, revolutionary concept of socialist
construction and serves the most reactionary circles,'' said a
statement read to Polish Ambassador Jerzy Wozniak in Bucharest by
Romanian Communist Party secretary, Ion Stojan.
   Romanian communists turned that same night to leaders of the
other Warsaw Pact Communist Parties ``to express grave concern and
to jointly act in favor of preventing a serious situation in
Poland, in favor of defending socialism and the Polish nation,''
PAP said.
   There was no indication what type of united action Ceausescu
envisioned. A similar justification was used in the 1968 invasion
of Czechoslovakia, in which Soviet bloc troops crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms of Alexander Dubcek. Romania was the only member
of the bloc that did not join the invasion.
   The late Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev had invoked the Brezhnev
Doctrine, allowing Moscow to intervene militarily if the Kremlin
considered communism ``in danger'' in other Warsaw Pact countries.
   Warsaw Pact countries did not move to interfere with
Mazowiecki's government. Soviet leaders said the naming of the new
government was a matter of internal Polish politics.

<HEAD>Report: Flight Recorder Differs From Voice Recorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flight recorder of the USAir plane that
crashed at LaGuardia Airport last week indicates that the plane's
rudder was misaligned before the aborted takeoff, a newspaper
reported today.
   The cockpit voice recorder shows the pilots, while conducting a
pre-flight checklist, found the cockpit gauge showed the rudder was
properly centered, The New York Times reported in today editions.
   Citing unidentified industry sources, the Times said the
conflicting evidence raised the question of whether the discrepancy
was due to a mechanical problem or whether the crew made a mistake
in reading the gauge.
   The flight recorder steadily records data on 70 of the plane's
conditions, including the position of the rudder.
   The rudder position on the 737-400 has become the focus of an
investigation of the Sept. 20 crash in which two passengers were
killed and 45 of 61 on board were hurt, the paper said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board earlier this week said
the trim actuator _ operated from the cockpit and which helps
position the rudder _ had been found in the extreme-left position
on the wreck.
   That would have made the plane veer to the left during takeoff
as has been reported by the captain of the jet.
   The pilot has said the veer and an unusual vibration he felt led
him to take over the controls from the co-pilot and abort the
takeoff.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze sent PLO chief Yasser Arafat a message suggesting that
a dialogue between the PLO and Israel could take place in Moscow, a
Palestinian news agency said.
   The Palestinian news agency WAFA said the message from
Shevardnadze was passed to Mahmoud Abbas, a member of the executive
committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, by the Soviet
charge d'affaires in Tunis.
   Arafat received it on Friday, the agency said.
   Shevardnadze made a similar proposal Thursday at the U.N.
General Assembly in New York.
   Abbas termed the offer an important step in the peace process
and urged ``the Israeli government to respond favorably and without
preconditions,'' WAFA said.
   The Israeli government has refused to meet with the PLO, which
it considers a terrorist group.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has proposed that a meeting
between Israel and the PLO on ending the 21-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied territories be held
in Cairo.
   At least 575 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have died in the Arab
revolt.

<HEAD>300 Sinhalese Extremists Surrender, 3 Die In Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 Sinhalese extremists
have surrendered in the army's 4-day-old cease-fire, but other
radicals launched more attacks and killed three people, the
government said today.
   A government statement said the extremists had surrendered since
Wednesday, when the military halted operations against the People's
Liberation Front hoping to persuade the ultranationalists to
initiate peace talks.
   The cease-fire was to expire early today, but President
Ranasinghe Premadasa extended it until 6 a.m. Tuesday. The Front
has rejected the truce.
   The statement said Front members killed at least three people,
including a security force member, on Friday and early today in
central and southern Sri Lanka.
   The deaths brought to 17 the number of people killed since
Wednesday by the Front, which opposes the Sinhalese-dominated
government's peace plan granting limited autonomy to Tamils in the
island's northern and eastern areas.
   Tamils want a separate nation and complain of discrimination by
the majority Sinhalese in jobs and education.
   The Sinhalese extremists also burned 12 post offices, 11 other
government buildings and three government vehicles over the past
four days, the government said without elaborating.
   On Friday, 14 government offices, 10 state-owned buses, seven
post offices and a factory were reported burned by the extremists
who have waged a 2-year-old battle to overthrow the government.
   The Sinhalese war and the military's counter-operations have
cost more than 5,000 lives since 1987, the year the government
reached the peace agreement with the Tamil minority and invited
Indian troops to help disarm Tamil rebels.
   Ultranationalist Sinhalese launched their campaign of
assassinations and terror that year, accusing the government of
making too many concessions to Tamil secessionists. The Front also
protests the deployment of Indian peacekeeping soldiers, saying
they compromise the country's independence.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent and dominate the government and the
military.
   At least 11,000 people including 1,000 Indian soldiers have been
killed since the Tamil separatist war began in 1983.

<HEAD>Investigators Saying Little On Fatal Train-Firetruck Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CATLETT, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The collision between an Amtrak train and a
firetruck was the third in five years at a rural crossing, but one
official said the crash that killed two firefighters was
``unavoidable.''
   State and federal investigators declined to speculate on the
cause of Thursday evening's wreck, but they said there was no sign
the train crew was at fault.
   ``There is no indication that there was any improper action on
the part of the train's crew that in any way led to the accident,''
Amtrak spokesman Michael Stewart said.
   The Amtrak Crescent, carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20,
was en route from New York to Atlanta and New Orleans when it
struck a Catlett Volunteer Fire Department truck about 50 miles
southwest of Washington, D.C.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and the state police
are investigating the accident, in which 12 of the train's 16 cars
and two locomotives derailed.
   The track was reopened Friday afternoon.
   A preliminary investigation by Amtrak showed the train was
traveling at 77 mph at the time of the collision, just below the
speed limit of 79 mph, Stewart said.
   Local authorities said it was the third collision in five years
at the crossing on a private road near Virginia 28. The previous
two did not cause any injuries.
   The crash highlighted the danger of the crossing, authorities
said. There is a railroad crossing sign at the junction, but no
crossing bar or warning light.
   ``It was an unavoidable accident,'' Fauquier County Deputy
Sheriff Robert Mosier said. ``The crossing sits on a steep grade,
so the driver couldn't stop to look. He had his lights on and the
siren running next to his ear, not to mention the sound of the
truck's motor.''
   State police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said the firetruck
carrying five firefighters was responding to a report of a car fire
near a home on the other side of the tracks.
   Stewart said the train sounded its horn when it approached the
crossing.
   Firefighters Mark Miller, 23, the driver of the truck, and Matt
Smith, 22, the front-seat passenger, both of Catlett, died at the
scene.
   ``It really shakes you. It's devastating,'' Catlett Fire Chief
Clyde Lomax said. ``We're just trying to stay together, talk this
thing out.''
   Seven people _ two firefighters and five passengers _ remained
hospitalized early today.
   One firefighter, Ernest Colbert, was listed in serious condition
at Fairfax Hospital. Another, Michael S. Kirk, 21, was in fair
condition at Washington Hospital Center.
   The fifth fireman, Frankie Herndon, was treated at a local
hospital and released.
   Caldwell said a total of 68 train passengers and 10 crew members
were sent to hospitals, as well as the three firefighters. Another
80 or so passengers were treated for minor injuries at the scene,
she said.
   Kirk, interviewed by telephone from his hospital bed Friday,
said he could not recall the crash.
   ``I don't remember anything,'' Kirk said. ``The last thing I
remember I was mowing the grass ... then I was here.''
   Last year 594 people were killed and 2,344 were injured in 5,820
grade-crossing wrecks nationwide. In Virginia, six people were
killed and 41 were injured in 110 crossing crashes in 1988.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for neighbors of the Fernald uranium
processing plant says he hopes a judge's approval of a $78 million
settlement leads to early monitoring of health risks in the area.
   ``If early detection of cancer saves even one life, it's worth
it,'' said Stanley Chesley, who led lawyers for 14,000 plaintiffs
in the 4-year-old class-action lawsuit.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel filed an order Friday
saying he found fair and reasonable a settlement to the suit
offered by the U.S. Department of Energy, owner of the Feed
Materials Production Center. The settlement will support long-term
medical studies of residents within five miles of the plant.
   The 38-year-old facility located 18 miles northwest of
Cincinnati processes uranium for use in nuclear reactors and
weapons.
   The Energy Department offered June 30 to settle a $300 million
claim by neighbors who said radioactive pollution from the plant
inflicted emotional suffering and reduced their property values.
Spiegel ruled that the settlement is limited to those two issues.
   Chesley has said lawyers expect medical monitoring to last 30 to
40 years and track such ailments as lung cancer and kidney disease.
   Claims by individual residents were certified as a class-action
lawsuit in September 1986.
   Spiegel rejected the government's contention that the settlement
protects the Energy Department from claims by neighbors for the
cost of cleaning up radioactive contamination of their property. He
said the neighbors are free to file such claims.
   Henry Gill Jr., the Energy Department's chief lawyer in the
case, declined to comment Friday from his Washington office, saying
he had not seen the judge's order.
   Spiegel dismissed objections to the settlement by Ruetgers-Nease
Chemical Co. and Delta Steel Corp., commercial neighbors of the
Fernald plant. Spiegel ruled that the companies lack legal standing
to object to the settlement because they don't own the property on
which they operate in the five-mile radius set as a requirement for
participation in the lawsuit.
   William Kennedy, a lawyer for Ruetgers-Nease, also declined
comment from his Philadelphia office, saying he hadn't seen
Spiegel's order.
   Spiegel appointed three people to serve as court-supervised
masters and trustees to oversee implementation of the settlement.

   Despite optimism over prospects for a superpower
treaty to cut long-range nuclear weapons, the chief U.S. delegate
said hundreds of disagreements must still be resolved.
   Talks on the treaty resumed Friday and Ambassador Richard Burt
told reporters after a one-on-one meeting with his Soviet
counterpart Yuri Nazarkin that the ``spirit of Jackson Hole has
moved to Geneva.''
   He referred to last weekend's talks in Wyoming between Secretary
of State James Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze. Those meetings ended with senior aides on both sides
saying a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was within reach.
   Burt said, however, his team must read the ``fine print'' of the
Soviet proposals that prompted the optimistic assessments.
   Detailed negotiations begin Monday with a full meeting of both
delegations.
   The new round of talks is the 12th since negotiations began in
March 1985.
   Asked about prospects for completing the treaty by the
superpower summit _ scheduled for late spring or early summer next
year _ Burt replied that it ``would be a major mistake for us to
negotiate against an artificial deadline.''
   He said Shevardnadze's remarks in Wyoming ``apparently'' mean
that Moscow dropped its linkage between a treaty and an accord on
defense and space issues.
   The Soviets said in Wyoming that they would drop a demand that
the United States curb work on a space-based missile defense
program before a treaty on long-range missiles is completed.
   ``We need to understand very clearly what the Soviets are and
are not proposing here,'' Burt said.
   He made plain that Washington was not enthusiastic about the
Soviet offer to take the issue of submarine-launched cruise
missiles out of a treaty. The United States does not believe these
missiles can be effectively monitored, he said.
   ``We have heard some Soviet ideas and as Secretary Baker has
said, our first reaction is positive. Our job here is to read the
fine print and fully understand what the Soviets are telling us.''
   The draft treaty text covers more than 450 pages, he said.
   ``There are hundreds of disagreements on a range of issues. Some
of them are big, important questions and some are small technical
disputes,'' Burt said.

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three more ethnic groups in the East bloc gained
representation in the PEN international writers association, and
Soviet delegates attended the association's meeting for the first
time.
   Concluding its weeklong congress Friday, PEN accepted Ukrainian,
Czech and Slovak chapters as members.
   A 65-year quarrel ended in May with the admission of the first
chapter from the Soviet Union, based in Moscow. PEN had kept out
the Soviet Union, citing that country's persecution of writers and
other intellectuals. Moscow had regarded the authors' group as
anti-communist.
   For the first time, two Soviet delegates from the Moscow chapter
attended the Canadian congress, held in Toronto and Montreal.
   The Ukrainian chapter will be based in Kiev in the Soviet
Ukraine but, based on language, will accept Ukrainian writers from
anywhere. Mykola Vingranovsky, its representative, said in a
statement that the chapter will work to keep the Ukrainian language
alive in modern life.
   A Lithuanian chapter also was admitted in May to join Latvian
and Estonian chapters that existed in exile.
   PEN's international secretary, Alexander Blokh, said the Baltic
chapters are not considered part of the Soviet Union for PEN's
administrative purposes.
   ``It is not a country that is represented; it is a literature,''
he said in an interview.
   The Czech chapter, dormant since the 1968 Soviet intervention,
was reactivated and the new Slovak chapter was recognized
separately at its request.
   Czech playwright Vaclav Havel, a rights activist sentenced to
nine months imprisonment in February, said in a message to the
congress that the separation was in the interest of both
literatures, no matter how close they might be.
   Czechoslovakia denied Havel a passport. He was represented by an
empty chair Thursday at a discussion to which he had been invited.
   Bulgarian, Hungarian, Polish and East German chapters also exist.
   While PEN expressed cautious optimism about the new contacts, it
expressed concern about threats to freedom of expression in the Far
East.
   Thomas von Vegesack, chairman of the International PEN Writers
in Prison Committee, told the congress, ``We have had a long, long
list of writers and journalists who have been jailed in China.''
   He said the latest word was 33 new cases of writers imprisoned
in China since the pro-democracy demonstrations.
   A resolution passed this week said PEN was appalled by the
events of Tiananmen Square and reports of torture routinely used
against those arrested.
   Von Vegesack reported that his committee had a list of 358 cases
throughout the world, with 78 people released and 127 new cases
since March.
   ``This is the highest figure the committee has had on its list
in five years,'' he wrote.
   He noted that before glasnost, Europe was the continent with the
most cases. ``Today, most of our new cases are in the Far East,''
he wrote.
   Von Vegesack told reporters he knew of 41 writers and
journalists arrested in South Korea.
   A resolution passed by PEN said it was distressed by reports of
the ``disappearance'' of dissidents and asked the Burmese
government to cease what PEN views as the persecution of writers.
   PEN, founded in 1921, has about 11,000 members in more than 90
chapters organized along language lines. It is an international
association of poets, playwrights, editors, essayists and novelists.
   The association is holding its convention in Canada for the
first time. The Canadian English-speaking chapter acted as host in
Toronto. The group then traveled to Montreal on Wednesday where the
French-speaking chapter was host.
   A PEN resolution expressed ``anxiety'' that a possible
plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political future ``as drafted up to now
ignores the linguistic and cultural reality of the Puerto Rican
people.''

<HEAD>Police Say Two Gunmen Arrested After Their Guns Jam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men attempted to fire into a crowd
with an Uzi submachine gun and a semiautomatic pistol but their
guns jammed, police said.
   ``If their guns hadn't jammed, we'd of had a bloodbath, a real
massacre,'' Chief Inspector John Griffin said Friday.
   Arthur Little, 19, and Daniel Hampton, 21, both of New York
City, were arrested and charged with criminal attempt at murder,
conspiracy to commit murder, possession of narcotics with intent to
sell and altering the serial numbers of guns.
   They were held on $250,000 bond and were scheduled to be
arraigned Monday.
   The incident Friday night in this city 80 miles northeast of New
York City probably was drug-related, Griffin said. The men
apparently were after someone they argued with a few days ago, he
said.
   About a dozen people, including several pregnant women, were on
the street when the two gunmen appeared, police said.
   ``They walked up to the crowd and pulled out the guns. People
heard the guns being cocked and began running. Both weapons jammed.
The guys ran off,'' Griffin said. ``We were lucky, very lucky.''
   Police said they caught the men in the darkened basement of
nearby home with a jammed Uzi submachine gun and semiautomatic,
.38-caliber pistol.
   The guns, which had live bullets in their chambers, were taken

<HEAD>Refusal On Marcos Burial May Cost National Unity, Says Laurel</HEAD>

   President Corazon Aquino's refusal to
allow Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in his homeland may cost her
the chance for national reconciliation, Vice President Salvador
Laurel said today.
   The vice president also said lawyers for Marcos and his family
will ask the Supreme Court on Monday to reconsider its decision
dismissing the former president's petition to return home.
   ``I feel sorry that she is wasting a very good opportunity to
unite the country and our people,'' said Laurel, who heads the
opposition Nationalista Party. ``This is a very good chance to
achieve true national reconciliation if she will allow the body of
former President Marcos to come home.''
   ``But her stubbornness and strict refusal to allow Marcos' body
back could create deeper resentment among our people,'' Laurel said
at a news conference. ``Let justice be done. I don't think two
wrongs will make right.''
   The 72-year-old Marcos died of cardiac arrest Thursday in
Honolulu. Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly rejected appeals for Marcos
and his family to come home, claiming his return would trigger
domestic unrest.
   In an 8-7 vote, the Supreme Court on Sept. 15 dismissed a
petition by Marcos asking for his return. The court agreed with
Mrs. Aquino that the former president's return ``poses a serious
threat to national interest.''
   Laurel said the tribunal may reconsider its decision now that
Marcos is dead.

<HEAD>Phoenix Mayor's Reelection Bid Could Be Hurt by Unpopular Ventures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard's bid for a fourth
two-year term could hinge on his opponents' ability to capitalize
on the popular mayor's support for unpopular projects.
   Those projects include an amphitheater that neighbors opposed, a
Grand Prix auto race that snarled downtown traffic for weeks and a
multibillion-dollar mass-transit project rejected by voters earlier
this year.
   But a Phoenix Gazette poll two weeks before Tuesday's election
showed Goddard had the support of 54 percent of the city's
registered voters, with only 10 percent for Republican Party
chairman Burton Kruglick, the strongest opponent. About 32 percent
were undecided.
   The son of former Gov. Sam Goddard, who heads the state
Democratic Party, the 42-year-old mayor burst onto the political
scene early in the decade when he led successful campaigns against
a state gasoline tax and for district elections for City Council
members.
   First elected mayor in 1983, Goddard has gained national stature
in recent months as president of the National League of Cities.
   But his challengers _ Kruglick and Norris Inman, a real estate
broker _ claim Goddard has supported grandiose plans that taxpayers
neither want nor can afford.
   Kruglick, 64, said his research showed nearly half the voters
``felt that the city had no direction, was too political and was
high-handed.''
   Goddard scoffs at the idea of a voter backlash.
   ``There are a few people who want to stand up on a street corner
and shout, but believe me, most people I talk to are neutral or
very enthusiastic about what we've done,'' he said recently.
   The city election is legally non-partisan, but Kruglick,
recently endorsed by President Bush, maintains that a Republican
challenger was needed because Goddard is a high-profile Democrat
with designs on the governor's office.
   Inman, who never has held public office, was defeated by a 2-1
margin in his only other campaign, a bid for the City Council in
1987.
   Goddard's support for a proposed amphitheater in a northwest
Phoenix neighborhood that wanted no part of it was defeated when
the City Council rejected the proposal.
   A proposition on Tuesday's ballot would prohibit future councils
from spending more than $3 million for amphitheaters or sports
arenas without voter approval.
   Goddard also was on the losing side when voters resoundingly
defeated multibillion-dollar proposals to expand the
mass-transportation system and to develop the dry Salt River bed
through Phoenix.
   Goddard supports city financing of a downtown baseball stadium,
another issue on the ballot.
   Voters will decide whether the city should spend no more than
$100 million toward the cost of either a football-baseball stadium
or a baseball-only stadium. If the measure is approved, property
taxes would be raised a maximum of 10 cents per $100 valuation.

<HEAD>North Carolina Refuses KKK Offer to `Adopt-a-Highway'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state refused the Ku Klux Klan
permission to join an Adopt-a-Highway clean-up program that would
have allowed the group to post its name on signs along a stretch of
road running through a black neighborhood.
   State Transportation Secretary Jim Harrington said Friday he was
denying the request from the Rockingham County chapter of The
Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to adopt a section of
U.S. 158, about 100 miles northwest of Raleigh.
   Under the program, the state puts up eye-catching,
green-and-white road signs naming the group or business that has
pledged to clean the adopted stretch of road four times a year.
   The Klan asked for a 3.4-mile stretch of road through a
predominately black neighborhood that leads to its rally site.
   Rockey Chapman, a leader of the Klan chapter, vowed to fight the
decision, and he was supported by the state branch of the American
Civil Liberties Union.
   ``Here we are trying to do something civic, and they slap us in
the face,'' Chapman said. ``I strongly feel that I have not been
given my constitutional rights. I do want this road, and I won't
stop until I get it.''
   ``For government to adopt censorship is to do a Klan-like thing
and literally give the victory to the Klan,'' said Jim Shields,
executive director of the North Carolina branch of the ACLU.
   The state has 4,756 volunteer groups participating in the
clean-up program.
   ``I don't understand why they are refusing me,'' said Chapman,
identified as the Exalted Cyclops of the Klan's Reidsville Southern
Alliance.
   ``I've got the same intentions behind me that everyone else
does, it's just the name that's scaring them, and it shouldn't,''
Chapman said. ``We are trying to help humans in the world today _
white humans.''

<HEAD>Principal Suspended Over Students' Boxing Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A middle school principal who says he put boxing
gloves on two brawling eighth graders to let them blow off steam
and avoid suspension has himself been suspended by irate
administrators.
   Principal Frank Romero said last week's boxing match followed a
spate of fights between the two students over the past month. The
brief bout was a ``healthy and therapeutic'' release of aggression
designed to keep them from being suspended from Stockard Middle
School in Dallas, he said.
   But his superiors in the Dallas Independent School District said
the 27-year educator violated discipline policies by allowing the
fight. They suspended him for six days with pay.
   Romero said he was told after the fight that district policies
required him to paddle the students or suspend them, not let them
box. But he was unrepentant.
   ``There's nothing in the policy books that says you can't have
the kids box,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to hurt kids. I'm trying
to save kids. It's easy to expel them. But it's difficult to keep
them in school after that.''
   At a school board meeting this week, five parents rallied to
defend the principal, who has been recognized for having rid the
school grounds of drug dealers.
   ``I think what he did was right,'' PTA president Sarah Vargas
said.
   Chad Woolery, assistant superintendent for secondary education,
declined to comment on Romero's suspension except to say it
involved ``questions over following policies.''
   Romero, 56, said he feared a recent rash of fights between the
two boys would escalate into a gang war. He said two assistant
principals and a teacher witnessed the after-school boxing match
Sept. 20.
   ``I brought them into the office, and they had another fight in
the office as soon as we turned our backs,'' he said. ``I asked
them if they wanted to box. They said yes.''
   Both boys began boxing with regulation gloves for what was
supposed to be two rounds of two minutes each, but they tired in
less than a minute, Romero said. Both 14-year-olds displayed a
changed attitude immediately, he said.
   ``They shook hands. They hugged. Their dignity was not marred,''
said Romero, who will return to work Monday.

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanese legislators who have survived
a 14{-year-old civil war gathered today for peace talks, but they
divided over the deployment of Syrian forces and Moslem demands for
greater political power.
   King Fahd, in an opening address read by Foreign Minister Prince
Saud al Fasisal, called on the Christian and Moslem lawmakers to
set aside their differences and end fighting that has killed more
than 150,000 people.
   ``Now that the situation has shifted from the arena of warriors
to the negotiators' table, it is high time we moved from trading
artillery shells and accusations to hasten the peacemaking,'' the
king's message said.
   Fahd is a member of a three-nation committee mandated by the
22-member Arab League to end the bloodletting and reconcile
Lebanon's feuding factions.
   An Arab League-sponsored peace plan included a Sept. 22
cease-fire that ended the latest round of fighting between Syrian
forces and Christian army units under Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads
the Christian Cabinet. More than 920 people have died in the last
six months of intensive shelling in Lebanon.
   Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid
of Algeria formulated the seven-point peace plan that includes a
``national reconciliation charter'' of political reforms that the
Lebanese parliamentarians will debate.
   The Fahd speech delivered at the Conference Palace in this
mountain resort said the blueprint is ``a realistic and practical
basis for a solution'' to the conflict that broke out in 1975.
   The Taif meeting is the first by Lebanon's parliament outside
the country.
   By holding the talks on neutral ground, the Arab League has
sought to reduce sectarian pressures on the legislators which have
been a major factor in the collapse of earlier initiatives.
   The Fahd message to the parliamentarians said: ``The night of
Lebanon's tragedy has gone on much too long, and the dawn ... will
come sooner or later. The decision is up to you. Lebanon and all
Lebanese will be the winners if you agree among yourselves. The
world is closely following your historic meeting.''
   Some of the Lebanese deputies who arrived in Taif late Friday
said the meeting would last three-to-10 days.
   Conference sources said 63 of Lebanon's 73 surviving legislators
_ 33 Christians and 30 Moslems _ were attending the Taif
conference. Three Shiite Moslem and seven Christian deputies failed
to show up.
   ``No one has refused to come, but some gave medical reasons for
not attending,'' Saud said.
   Twenty-five of the deputies in the 99-seat Parliament have been
killed or died of natural causes since the last elections in 1972.
Another seat was held by Amin Gemayel, whose six-year term as
president expired on Sept. 22, 1988. The war has prevented
elections since then and Lebanon has no head of state.
   Christian-Moslem differences split the government into the rival
camps.
   Before the deputies left the Lebanese capital Beirut on Friday,
Lebanon's acting prime minister, Salim Hoss, said the Taif meeting
``could be the last chance for peace in Lebanon.''
   Parliament Speaker Hussein Husseini told reporters upon arriving
in Taif: ``We are determined to reach a unified concept on the
issue of political reform to achieve national reconciliation.''
   While agreeing to the meeting, Christians said they would not
discuss political reform unless Syria agreed to a timetable for
withdrawing its 40,000 troops from Lebanon. They arrived under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate but soon allied with Moslem
militias in fighting the Christians.
   Syria has said it will not consider a withdrawal until a united
government emerges in Lebanon and the Moslems are given a larger
share of power in constitutional reforms.
   The proposed reforms call for Lebanon's Maronites, the dominant
Christian sect, to surrender the privileges they have held since
independence from France in 1943. They would share power equally
with the country's Moslems.
   In 1943, the Christians were considered the majority. But
Moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of Lebanon's 4 million
people.
   The latest outbreak in fighting began in March, when Aoun
blockaded illegal militia-run ports saying they deprived the state
of more than $100 million yearly in lost revenues. The
Syrian-Moslem alliance responded by blockading the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave in and around Beirut.

<HEAD>Muted National Day Celebrations Begin in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese today began a long holiday weekend
celebrating the 40th anniversary of Communist rule, but most were
barred from festivities in Tiananmen Square which remains closed to
the general public.
   Many Chinese said they had no special plans for the four-day
weekend.
   ``I've borrowed a whole stack of books. I'm going to read and
sleep in,'' said a college student.
   ``We'll spend the weekend resting, just like everybody else,''
another student said.
   Some private entreprenuers said they would work as usual.
   Unlike previous years, most Chinese will not be allowed into
central Beijing's Tiananmen Square to see the elaborate, colorful
flower arrangements.
   In past years, the square teemed with people admiring the
displays and posing for souvenir snapshots. This year, however,
only groups who have permission are allowed into the square.
   Tiananmen has been closed to the general public since June 3-4,
when troops shot their way into the capital to crush the popular
pro-democracy movement and retake Tiananmen from the students.
   This morning thousands of people, including foreign tourists and
low-level officials from the countryside, arrived at the square in
a caravan of buses. Kindergarten children played games amid the
flower arrangements while men flew long kites in the warm autumn
breeze.
   Rows of red flags fluttered in the square and atop the landmarks
that border Tiananmen: the Great Hall of the People, the wall of
the Forbidden City and the history museum.
   Throughout the city, colored flags and China's national flag _
red with five stars _ flew on rooftops, and long red banners
encouraged people to ``warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.''
   Massive flower arrangements with patriotic slogans such as
``socialism is good'' have been placed at main intersections.
Official reports say about 1 million pots of flowers have been set
out throughout the capital.
   China's top leaders planned a reception tonight for foreign
diplomats, businessmen and journalists, and Chinese model workers
and dignitaries.
   This year's festivities have been drastically cut back from the
activities that were expected to celebrate four decades of
Communist rule.
   A military parade, which was to have been the first in five
years, was canceled without explanation. The main activities will
be dances performed by thousands of workers and students on Sunday
morning in Tiananmen Square and a massive fireworks show in the
evening.
   This afternoon, 300 students at Beijing Normal University, one
of the hotbeds of student activism this spring, practiced dances
one last time.
   A second-year economics major sitting in the bleachers watching
her classmates practicing in large circles in the field below said
the dancers were selected on the basis of their dancing ability and
political purity.
   But nearly the entire school was involved in the seven-week
pro-democracy movement, and the student, who did not give her name,
said there were at least a few among the dancers who had
participated in the movement.
   Students at the Normal University and other schools in northwest
Beijing's university district said the campuses had little of the
holiday atmosphere of past National Days.
   At Beijing University, also a center of student activism this
spring, a second-year law student said with a sigh, ``Last year we
celebrated National Day with such enthusiasm.''
   A sign at the school's announcement board area, which this
spring was plastered with hundreds of big-character poster calling
for democracy and other reforms, said a dance would be held tonight.
   But the law student, who also did not give her name, said no
other activities were planned because the semester has not yet
started.
   Classes were delayed at Beijing University until mid-October,
partly to avoid any disturbance during the National Day festivities.

   Non-communist guerrillas said
they launched a major offensive in Cambodia that captured two towns
and 10 other positions from the pro-Vietnamese government.
   The claim came soon after Vietnam said its last troops had
pulled out of Cambodia, where they fought the guerrillas for more
than a decade. The battle is now being waged by soldiers of the
government Vietnam installed.
   Also today, a Vietnam News Agency report monitored in Bangkok,
Thailand, said Cambodia's government in Phnom Penh plans to hold
general elections at the end of the year whether or not a political
solution to the insurgency is found.
   A spokesman for the Khmer People's National Liberation Front,
Abdulgaffar Peang-Meth, said 5,000 guerrilla fighters attacked five
towns and other positions along Highway 69, which parallels
Cambodia's western border.
   Gen. Dien Del, acting commander of the front, said his fighters
knocked out tanks, overran 10 army positions flanking the highway
and seized a district capital, Thmar Puok. The Vietnamese army left
that town six days ago.
   At the town of Banteay Chmar, which Dien Del said was also
seized, the front captured a warehouse with 1,000 weapons, he said.
   Dien Del said the attackers sustained light casualties and
inflicted heavy losses on Cambodia's forces, estimated at 4,500
soldiers. He said one Soviet-built T-54 tank was destroyed, two
disabled and a fourth captured.
   His claims could not be independently verified.
   ``Our intention is to test the strength of the government of
President Heng Samrin and force Phnom Penh to the negotiating
table,'' the general said.
   A Western diplomat said that if true, the fall of Thmar Puok
would be a ``major victory'' for the front.
   A Western relief official based in the border town of
Aranyaprathet said heavy shelling could be heard near the key
border town from early morning.
   He said the front's vast refugee camp of Site 2, 30 miles to the
north, was closed to relief workers for fear of possible
retaliation by government gunners. Site 2 is the largest camp on
the border, housing 140,000 people.
   ``We will know more in the next couple of days,'' the relief
official said. ``At the moment it is difficult to judge how much is
true and how much is propaganda.'' He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The general also discussed the assault on Sisophon, located at
the junction of highways 69 and 5 and at the southern end of the
38-mile-long and 10-to-25-mile deep area the front says it is
attacking.
   He said Sisophon was listed as among the five major objectives
of the offensive and was attacked for ``psychological warfare
reasons.''
   He said there would be no attempt to capture it. Earlier, front
officers said their troops had already entered Sisophon. The
northernmost town is Banteay Chmar. The other targeted towns are
Svey Chiek and Kandoun.
   The diplomat said the front may have timed the push with drives
by its guerrilla coalition partners _ the communist Khmer Rouge and
a group loyal to resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk _ in
other areas along the Thai-Cambodian border.
   The front claims to have 16,000 fighters. The strongest
guerrilla group, the Khmer Rouge, fields up to 40,000, according to
Western estimates.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge in
late 1978, said it completed withdrawal of its troops on Tuesday.
But the guerrillas say thousands of Vietnamese have stayed behind.
   Some diplomats say the poorly trained and equipped Cambodian
army may not be able to beat back the guerrillas without Vietnamese
support.
   The Khmer Rouge has recently claimed a series of battle
successes against Cambodian army units, which they say were
supported by Vietnamese troops.

   The legislature of the Baltic republic Lithuania
has ordered government officials to negotiate with Moscow to permit
youths to perform their military service close to home, an activist
said today.
   Rimantas Kanapenas, head of Sajudis political movement's press
center, said in a telephone interview that the resolution seeks to
have all Lithuanian military recruits serve in their home republic
or one of the two other Baltic republics beginning next year.
   Under the resolution approved Friday, the republic's Council of
Ministers, or Cabinet, is required to open talks with the Soviet
Defense Ministry, he said.
   The issue of having Baltic recruits serve close to home has been
raised by Sajudis and other People's Front organizations in the
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, which are clamoring for
sovereignty from Moscow in their political and economic affairs.
   Soviet Defense Ministry officials have scoffed at the idea,
saying the county needs a unified defense rather than one based on
regional interests.

   Senate Votes to Bar Counting of Illegals in Census
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau would be barred from
counting illegal aliens in next year's census under a measure
approved by the Senate in a decision that could affect the
redrawing of congressional districts.
   ``An occupying army would qualify'' for being counted in the
census under current rules, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Friday
as the Senate approved the legislation on a voice vote and attached
it to a $17.3 billion money bill for the Commerce, State and
Justice Departments.
   A move to table, or kill, the measure was defeated, 50-41
   The 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be
reallocated among the states following the 1990 census, with the
most populous states as always getting the most seats.
   Thus lawmakers from states with few illegal aliens would like to
see them omitted from next year's count.
   The measure sponsored by Sen. Richard C. Shelby, D-Ala., would
bar the use of funds contained in the Commerce Department
appropriation for counting the illegals in the census.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said some states would
lose congressional seats because they have few illegals.
   ``This policy simply does not make any sense,'' Dole said.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said, however, that a number of
urban areas are making sizeable expenditures on schools and health
care because of their high concentration of illegal aliens. Federal
aid to these areas would be decreased if they were not counted,
Wilson said.

<TEXT>
   The Justice Ministry will extradite a
Colombian woman to Florida next week to face federal drug
trafficking charges there, the Bogota newspaper El Tiempo reported
today.
   The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the report
with the Justice Ministry, which was closed today.
   The drug trafficking suspect, Ana Helena Rodriguez, 37, was
handed the extradition notice Friday, and she has until Oct. 6 to
appeal, the newspaper said. She was arrested last month.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in
Miami, said today that Ms. Rodriguez is one of several defendants
in a drug importation conspiracy case in Miami. She did not have
details of the charges.
   Ms. Rodriguez would become the second Colombian extradited to
the United States since President Virgilio Barco declared war on
drug traffickers Aug. 19.
   The first was Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was sent to Atlanta
Sept. 6 to face federal charges of money laundering.
   Neither is on a list compiled by the U.S. Justice Department of
12 most wanted Colombian traffickers being sought for extradition
to the United States.
   Seven bombs exploded Friday night in Colombia, five in Bogota
and two in the western city of Cali, the national police said in a
communique.
   Four of the bombs in Bogota were at public schools and one at a
bank, the police said. In Cali one bomb exploded at a department
store and another at a small grocery store near a Colombian air
force base, the police said.
   The seven bombs injured seven people slightly, including two
children at one of the Bogota schools, the police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bombs.
   The government's security forces have assumed that a wave of
bombings that began last month are the work of drug traffickers.
   There have been 125 bombs with 10 deaths and 148 people hurt. To
combat the wave of bombings, police have stepped up car searches at
Bogota checkpoints.
   On Friday, Barco made a speech at the United Nations in New York
calling for a worldwide effort to seize traffickers' assets.
   Drug barons began their offensive in response to a government
anti-drug crackdown announced hours after the leading presidential
candidate was assassinated by traffickers on Aug. 18. Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan had led a crusade against drugs in Medellin, the
nation's cocaine capital.
   Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana said in a televised speech late
Thursday the army and police were stepping up security in the
capital to try to catch terrorists before they can deliver bombs.
   On Friday, security forces searched cars at various points in
the city of 6 million, then moved on to set up new checkpoints.
Pastrana said there would be up to 120 checkpoints at any given
time.
   In the last two weeks, with only a few checkpoints, Bogota
security forces have inspected 12,330 vehicles and have found 363
pounds of dynamite, 145 guns and 17,153 rounds of ammunition,
Pastrana said.
   In his speech to the 159-nation U.N. General Assembly, Barco
urged all nations to sign the Vienna Convention on narcotics
trafficking, which provides penalties for users such as seizure of
ships and confiscation of property.
   ``A new world war is being waged by an aggressor unrestrained by
the traditional rules of engagement or by the responsibilities of
national sovereignty,'' Barco told the world body. ``There must be
no safe haven for the narco-terrorists,'' he said to loud applause.
   Barco spoke under extraordinary security precautions that
included sharpshooters perched atop buildings, bomb-sniffing dogs
and a legion of U.N. police aided by bomb squads.

   The world's biggest cocaine bust prompted
renewed calls for more anti-drug aid to southern California, which
the region's top federal narcotics agent called ``the cocaine
capital of the United States.''
   The 20 tons of cocaine was worth $2 billion wholesale and could
have brought up to $20 billion on the street if heavily diluted and
sold in smokeable ``rocks,'' authorities said Friday.
   That would be more than double the $9.4 billion the Senate
approved this week to fight the war on drugs next year _ and enough
dope to provide the 3 million residents of Los Angeles a ``rock'' a
day for three months.
   Authorities speculated that the huge size of the haul could
indicate that Colombia's crackdown on drug lords may have forced
them to combine their distribution networks.
   The raid Thursday night, at a warehouse in a quiet
light-industrial area 25 miles northwest of downtown, also yielded
at least three arrests, extensive records of dealers and at least
$10 million in cash stuffed in boxes.
   In addition to the three men arrested in Los Angeles, the Las
Vegas Sun reported today that three others were arrested by DEA
agents at an expensive Las Vegas hotel Friday in connection with
the drug seizure. The men, one of them a former Mexican customs
official, were arrested for investigation of importation and
distribution of narcotics, the newspaper said.
   DEA night duty officers in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.,
said they could not comment on the report, and Las Vegas police
said they had no information about any additional arrests.
   ``I've been on this job for 25 years, and I've never seen so
much dope in one place. I couldn't believe it,'' said John M.
Zienter, the Drug Enforcement Administration's special agent in
charge for Los Angeles.
   ``This narcotics seizure of the largest amount of cocaine in the
world should put to rest any further speculation about whether or
not Los Angeles has in fact become the cocaine capital of the
United States,'' Zienter said.
   DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said the seizure ``is an example of
the tremendous magnitude of the cocaine problem throughout the
United States.''
   But he and other officials in Washington said it was unclear if
most cocaine now enters the country through Los Angeles.
   Local officials renewed their call for more federal drug agents.
The Los Angeles DEA office has 110 agents; Miami and New York have
more than 300 each.
   ``Hey, Washington, listen to us: We need your help,'' Police
Chief Daryl Gates said. ``We want you to send double the number of
DEA agents out here. We need more customs. And we need more border
patrol.''
   Mayor Tom Bradley said Los Angeles had beefed up its police
force to the highest levels ever and still needed help.
   ``The federal drug agents who uncovered this drug house should
be applauded,'' Bradley said. ``Now it's time for the government to
send even more personnel to wage a winning war.''
   The 40,000-pound seizure, packed in cardboard boxes, easily
topped the previous U.S. record of about 8,700 pounds in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., in 1987. It also surpassed the world record, a
12-ton seizure in Colombia.
   By comparison, a total of 18.4 tons of cocaine was seized in
Miami in the nine months ended June 30, and 2.2 tons in Los
Angeles, DEA spokesman Frank Shults said.
   Many mysteries remained, including why so much cocaine from
rival Colombian drug cartels was found in the same warehouse.
   ``The transporters were moving both Cali and Medellin dope,''
DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said. ``That's unheard of in large
shipments like this.''
   He speculated that Colombia's crackdown on drug lords might have
forced the two former competitors to team up.
   ``The two cartels could be forming an alliance to use on
particular channels through the border,'' he said. ``It could be a
sign of their trying to regroup from what's going on in Colombia.''
   The three men arrested were to be arraigned Monday on drug
charges. They were not identified, and Lochridge said that although
they claimed to be Mexican, their accents were South American.
   Lochridge said more arrests were expected, but he declined to
elaborate.
   Drug agents said they were led to the warehouse by an
unidentified person. Some reports said a witness saw trucks
unloading at the warehouse.
   The cocaine seized would have been distributed across the
country by Los Angeles-based drug gangs, said Ira Reiner, Los
Angeles County district attorney. He added that the seized records
offered a list of leads that was ``endless.''
   ``These aren't just drug runners,'' Reiner said. ``These are the
major drug dealers. They don't get any bigger than this until you
get to Colombia.''
   Gates said the bust would dent the local narcotics traffic.
   ``But the unfortunate part of it is, it won't be a major dent.
That gives you some sense of the flow of narcotics coming in and
how much work there is to be done in stopping that flow,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An anti-papal activist threatened today to disrupt
the first visit to the Vatican by the Anglican church leader,
Archbishop Robert Runcie.
   The activist, the Rev. Ian Paisley, delivered a written protest
about Runcie's trip shortly after the Anglican leader held his
second meeting at the Vatican in two days with Pope John Paul II.
   ``If I spoil the party, I'll have done very well,'' Paisley told
reporters as he gave the protest to the archbishop's press
secretary at the English College residence for seminarians, where
Runcie is staying.
   Paisley is a Northern Ireland loyalist and head of the Free
Presbyterian Church in Northern Ireland, which is vehemently
anti-Roman Catholic.
   Paisley, who is also a member of the British and European
parliaments, refused to say what kinds of protests he planned
during Runcie's four-day visit, which ends Monday.
   Last year, Paisley interrupted a speech by Pope John Paul to the
European Parliament by screaming, ``I renounce you as the
anti-Christ.''
   Runcie, spiritual head of the state Church of England and leader
of the world's 70 million Anglicans, met for 55 minutes this
morning with the pope, head of 850 million Roman Catholics.
   They were expected to discuss efforts to reunite the churches
that split in the 16th century over the Vatican's refusal to annul
the marriage of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.
   No details were released about the talks, which also involved
Runcie's advisers and members of the Pontifical Council for
Promoting Christian Unity.
   Later today, the pope and Runcie were to pray together at
vespers and deliver speeches touching on reunification efforts,
which have been troubled by the Anglican church's ordination of
women.
   In the letter to Runcie, made available to reporters, Paisley
said: ``Your endeavor to de-Protestantize the Church of England and
make it a mere annex of Rome strikes at the constitutional liberty
of the United Kingdom and is destructive to the integrity of the
throne, the position of the queen and the Protestant succession.''
   The letter accused Runcie of ``high treason'' for the Anglican
leader's recent remarks that the Church of England might recognize
papal authority in a united church.
   Runcie's statements on papal leadership echoed a view stated
several years ago by a Vatican-Anglican commission working on a
framework for church unity.
   Nonetheless, the comments drew fire from Evangelicals in the
Church of England, who base their teaching strictly on the Bible
and oppose unity with Rome.
   In a brief speech today, Runcie told John Paul he was wearing a
ring that was given by Pope Paul VI to Anglican Archbishop Michael
Ramsey in 1966. He described it as ``a sign not unlike an
engagement ring.''
   ``It is a token of commitment,'' Runcie said. ``I wear it today
as we rededicate ourselves to the search for visible and
sacramental unity between Anglicans and Roman Catholics throughout
the world.''
   In his brief remarks, the pontiff noted the progress in
Anglican-Catholic relations in recent years, but said: ``We must
face our differences honestly.''
   Runcie gave the pope a painting of St. Augustine landing in
Britain to convert the English in the 6th century. The pope
presented the Anglican leader with a reproduction of an 11th
century illuminated book of Benedictine prayers.
   Runcie follows his three predecessors in visiting the Vatican.
The first visit to Rome by an archbishop of Canterbury, the head of
Anglicans worldwide, occurred in 1960.
   Runcie and John Paul have met previously in Africa, India and
Assisi, Italy.

<HEAD>Mother Says She Would Go Back to Jail to Protect Daughter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Dr. Elizabeth Morgan enjoys her first days
of freedom after 25 months in jail in a bitter parental visitation
rights battle, her ex-husband is stepping up efforts to locate
their daughter.
   ``I'm catching my breath now, and I'm beginning to adjust to
being out,'' Morgan says. ``But things like the weather _ noticing
the weather, that's just one thing I couldn't do when I was in
jail.''
   Morgan, 42, was jailed on civil contempt of court charges in
August 1987 for failing to produce her daughter, Hilary, for
court-ordered visits with Dr. Eric Foretich, her 46-year-old
ex-husband and the girl's father.
   Morgan alleges that Foretich sexually abused the girl, now 7;
Foretich, who denies those charges, claims that Morgan is mentally
ill.
   Hilary remains hidden at an undisclosed location, and Morgan has
vowed that she will go without seeing her daughter until the girl
turns 18 if necessary to protect her.
   On Wednesday, Foretich announced that he was establishing a fund
to pay for efforts to search for his daughter, and he once again
called upon Morgan to produce the child.
   ``Hilary is the ultimate loser in all of this,'' Foretich said.
``I want to see her safe, returned, with her rights restored.''
   Foretich says he is establishing the fund because the costs of
his extensive legal battle with Morgan and fees charged by previous
private investigators have left him financially strapped. He also
claims that his once-thriving oral surgery practice has dropped
off, and he blames negative publicity surrounding the case.
   Morgan was freed on Monday, after President Bush signed a bill
designed to limit civil contempt of court jailings in district
child custody cases. The legislation moved at lightning pace
through the House and Senate as lawmakers responded to Morgan's
plight with an urgency like that reserved for matters of national
emergency.
   But the bill contained a provision that calls for it to pass out
of existence after 18 months, which means Morgan could wind up in
jail again, particularly if Foretich makes good on his pledge to
keep fighting for his visitation rights.
   ``I would go back to jail,'' Morgan says. ``Not to be cavalier,
but after this experience, I could do it again, though of course I
wouldn't want to.''
   After Morgan was freed Monday, Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's
attorney, said future legal action against Morgan is likely.
   ``She remains in contempt of court, and this law doesn't change
that,'' Mittleman said. ``That's not being vengeful, that's just
what the law is about.''
   Meanwhile, Morgan has had her hair styled and been to the
dentist since her release, scheduling those mundane chores around
interviews with scores of reporters.
   She says she is restricted to the Washington area for the next
week because her fiance, federal appeals court judge Paul R.
Michel, has a heavy workload.
   After that, she says, ``We plan to disappear, to take some time
together.
   ``We both need that.''
   Foretich, in contrast, can only plot his next legal move and
hope that private investigators he has hired can come up with a
clue to his daughter's whereabouts.
   He is also anxious, like Morgan, to drop out of the harsh glare
of public scrutiny.
   ``I do not have any desire to be a media person,'' Foretich said
at his press conference. ``I would like to return to private life,
and I hope that this is once of the last times that I have to talk
to you.
   ``We need to get over this episode of heinous allegations...and
get back to family, love, caring, the things that are really
important.''

<TEXT>
   Shaken by a series of traumas culminating
in the indictment of former Premier Andreas Papandreou, Greece is
careening toward elections in November with no political party
clearly in control.
   An unlikely alliance of conservatives and Communists has been in
charge since early July, when voters ousted Papandreou's
scandal-tinged party but left no other group with enough votes to
form a government.
   Since then, the interim governing coalition has devoted nearly
all of its time to cleaning up scandals from Papandreou's
eight-year government. The coalition, shackled by fundamental
disagreements over economic and foreign policy, has been able to do
little else.
   Conservative New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis, the
main power behind the government, says the Cabinet will resign Oct.
6 and hold elections on Nov. 5. He said a caretaker Cabinet will
take the country into the elections.
   Mitsotakis has been pressing for quick balloting in the hope his
party, which won the most votes in the July balloting but was
unable to form a government, will win the majority in Parliament.
   The slaying of his son-in-law and conservative party spokesman,
Pavlos Bakoyannis, by a shadowy leftist urban guerrilla gang on
Tuesday may strengthen Mitsotakis' bid.
   The killing brought an outpouring of grief from all parts of the
political spectrum. It could help the 71-year-old Mitsotakis gain
the support of many undecided voters, who represent more than 10
percent of the electorate.
   Papandreou's situation should also help the conservatives. He
will have to campaign while under indictment and facing the
possibility of imprisonment if found guilty by a special court of
Supreme Court judges.
   Papandreou, 70, former dean of the economics department at the
University of California at Berkeley before returning to Greece to
enter politics 26 years ago, has denied any wrongdoing during his
tenure as head of a Panhellenic Socialist Movement government.
   He is accused of authorizing a $210 million embezzlement at the
Bank of Crete and of creating an illegal wiretapping network that
monitored the phones of his political friends and foes.
   The government has been cautious not to appear vindictive.
   Premier Tzannis Tzannetakis, a New Democracy deputy, said in an
interview with the liberal daily Eleftherotypia it was ``not at all
pleasant'' that the former premier would stand trial.
   ``But what could we do? Certain things were discovered ... could
we just let them go by?''
   In an address to Parliament on Wednesday, Papandreou said the
charges were based solely on the testimony of the bank's former
chairman and owner, George Koskotas.
   Koskotas is in a U.S. jail, where he has been fighting
extradition since he fled Greece last November. In interviews from
prison, he has charged that Papandreou blackmailed him in 1987 into
embezzling from the bank and funneling the money to the former
premier's socialist party.
   Papandreou, indicted along with four of his Cabinet ministers,
has been silent since Thursday. But his spokesman, Telemahos
Hytiris, said Papandreou remained ``politically combative.''
   ``He will participate in the election campaign and believes
sincerely that the results will be beneficial to (his party),''
Hytiris said.
   Despite health and legal problems, Papandreou has made it clear
he will not step down as the party's leader.
   When he was still in office and under fire for his alleged role
in scandals, Papandreou's government spokesman said he would be
president of his party for life. Papandreou told Parliament
Wednesday that only he can ``guarantee the continuation and unity
of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement.'' The business world has
reacted with optimism despite the scandals and coming elections.
The stock market surged to a record high Friday with a 10 percent
increase during three days of trading.
   ``The wretched performance of Papandreou and (his party) in
Parliament and the conviction that New Democracy will win an
outright majority in the elections contributed to this,'' said
financial consultant Constantine Harokopos.
   In contrast with Papandreou's socialist experiments and foreign
policy, New Democracy advocates a free market policy and closer
ties with NATO and the United States.
   The government announced in September that the public debt would
represent 105 percent of the gross national product in 1989 and
that servicing the $53 billion debt would cost more than a fifth of
the GNP.
   Inflation is running at 15 percent, almost four times the
European Community average.
   Mitsotakis has said that if his party wins a majority in the
300-member Parliament, he would negotiate a new defense agreement
with the United States to maintain U.S. military installations in
Greece. He said he also would extradite suspected Palestinian
terrorist Mohammed Rashid to the United States.
   A previous defense treaty has expired and the U.S. bases must be
removed by mid-1990 unless a new agreement is reached.
   Rashid's extradition has been approved by the Greek Supreme
Court but the final decision rests with the justice minister. That
post is held by leftist lawyer Fotis Kouvelis, who has said he will
not be responsible for such a decision.
   The United States charges that Rashid was responsible for the
in-flight bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Hawaii in 1982. A
Japanese teen-ager died in the blast and 15 other passengers were
injured.

<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam and Cambodia, two
nations joined by bloodshed and a border, share the same
aspirations for ending their isolation from the rest of the world.
   In Vietnam there is a fresh burst of optimism. The government
says its troops have finally ended a decade of fighting in
Cambodia, and people here believe they may be entering the first
period of peace in half a century.
   In Cambodia, there is only more dying and a grim realization
that the killing will probably intensify.
   ``I'm happy that our troops have come home so no more of our
soldiers will die,'' said a sales clerk in a Vietnamese store.
``But I'm worried there may be more unrest in Cambodia as a
result.''
   Cambodians fear a standoff between the three guerrilla groups
and the forces of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   Cambodian officials say Phnom Penh residents are stockpiling
food because of worries that the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the
guerrilla groups, may cut supply lines to the capital as they did
in 1975, when they encircled the city and overthrew the
U.S.-supported government.
   ``It's complex,'' said a Cambodian government technician in
Phnom Penh whose older brother was killed by the Khmer Rouge. ``I'm
glad we're taking responsibility for our own defense, but I'm also
nervous about what will happen.''
   In the long run, however, Vietnam's military pullout from
Cambodia could force a host of countries to re-evaluate their
policies toward Indochina and lift Hanoi and Phnom Penh out of
years of diplomatic and economic isolation.
   China and many Western nations cut ties with Vietnam after it
invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and removed the Khmer Rouge from
power. They refused to recognize the government Vietnam installed
in Phnom Penh.
   During its 3{-year rule, the Khmer Rouge murdered hundreds of
thousands of people in an attempt to ``cleanse the old society''
and create a radical Communist state.
   Evidence that all of Vietnam's troops have left Cambodia would
boost the growing credibility of the Hun Sen government and remove
the chief reason that China, Thailand and other nations give for
supporting the guerrilla coalition.
   Vietnam insists its last 26,000 soldiers withdrew from Cambodia
on Tuesday, leaving only a few advisers, but Chinese and Thai
officials charge that thousands of Vietnamese soldiers remain,
disguised as settlers or Cambodian troops.
   No internationally accepted group monitored the withdrawal
because a conference in Paris last month failed to agree on
arrangements for a team of observers.
   Gen. Pat Akkaniput of Thailand's Supreme Command says there are
well-founded suspicions of a continuing Vietnamese military
presence in Cambodia.
   ``Let this game (of withdrawal) finish and then we will watch,''
he said in a Bangkok interview.
   Thailand's position is crucial for the future of the guerrillas,
who are based along the Thai-Cambodian border and armed largely by
China. Thailand sees the Khmer Rouge as the main buffer between
Thailand and Vietnamese forces.
   Pat said his nation will stop aiding the insurgents only after
the Vietnamese withdrawal is verified, all outside military aid is
halted and a cease-fire is called. Until then, he said, Thai policy
is to maintain military pressure on Phnom Penh while keeping
communication open with Hun Sen open.
   Some analysts disagree with Pat's charge that Vietnamese troops
remain in Camobodia.
   They say Vietnam is staking its credibility and its future
economic growth on the claim of withrawal and that it is unlikely
Vietnam would do otherwise.
   ``I frankly don't think it would be possible to send troops back
because the (Vietnamese) people would oppose it,'' said a
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Before, troops could be sent by orders from the top,
but now too many people are against it.''
   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on Thursday, Vice President Dan
Quayle called for increased support for Prince Norodom Sihanouk and
Son Sann, leaders of the two non-Communist factions in the
guerrilla coalition, but declined comment on whether the United
States had begun providing them with military assistance.
   Earlier in the week, U.S. State Department officials said it was
still too early to normalize relations with Vietnam.
   Vietnamese leaders say supporters of the insurgents now should
reduce their aid to the guerrillas.
   ``We have created a favorable condition for a political
settlement by withdrawing from Cambodia,'' said Gen. Vo Nguyen
Giap, a key strategist during Vietnam's war with the United States.
``Now other countries must stop their military support.''
   Vietnam says the Khmer Rouge forces numbered 170,000 when it
invaded Cambodia in 1978. Now, it says, the three guerrilla groups
field a total of 50,000 fighters, including 17,000 Khmer Rouge.
   Western analysts estimate 30,000 to 40,000 Khmer Rouge are
facing 150,000 Cambodian government troops. The Khmer Rouge are
generally regarded as far better trained and more experienced than
the government troops. The guerrillas have little popular support,
however.
   Despite the resignation of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot from his
last official post in June, many believe he still holds power and
that the group has not changed its murderous ways.
   Vietnam says 23,000 guerrillas have entered Cambodia from Thai
bases in recent weeks to launch an offensive near the gem-mining
region of Pailin in western Cambodia.
   Hun Sen has acknowledged the insurgents have captured some
territory in the area. Although heavy casualties have been reported
in the fighting, Hun Sen told reporters he did not see any
possibility of Pailin falling to the insurgents.

<HEAD>US Looks to Step up Military Role in Singapore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has offered to step up
its military cooperation with the strategically located Asian
city-state of Singapore, Pentagon officials say.
   ``We've told them that we're prepared to send a small number of
fighter aircraft there on a temporary basis,'' said a high-level
Pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be identified by
name.
   Singapore, with a population of 2.6 million in an area about the
size of Chicago, is positioned on one of the world's most strategic
waterways, the Strait of Malacca, with access to both the Indian
Ocean and the South China Sea.
   The United States has strong economic ties with the increasingly
influential nation, which has a predominantly Chinese financial
center.
   The U.S. offer comes as the administration is preparing to enter
potentially difficult talks with the Philippines on extending the
lease of six U.S. military bases. The pact is due to expire in
September 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino said Thursday she has accepted
President Bush's offer to begin the talks, but she said there can
be no certainty the negotiations will produce agreement.
   Any agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate, where opposition is strong. At least 12 senators have
called publicly for the bases to be closed, while others have
demanded that U.S. payments increase dramatically.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said during his visit there this past
week that he was confident the two sides would reach agreement and
guarantee the ``longtime involvement'' of the United States in the
Philippines.
   The Pentagon official stressed that the United States has no
interest in replacing its Philippine bases with those in Singapore,
primarily because the facilities there are limited by the size of
the tiny nation.
   About 40,000 American troops, civilian employees and military
dependents are stationed at the six U.S. Philippine installations,
including Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay naval base.
   ``Singapore would make available facilities on a military base
that is being vacated by New Zealand,'' the official said.
   The United States would use the facilities to position aircraft
there, make ship calls and do some repair work, the official said.
   It would involve ``a small number of people _ 100 or less,'' the
official said.
   The United States is aware that such a development is not
necessarily desired by Singapore's neighbors, Malaysia and
Indonesia, the official said.
   However, even the small amount of cooperation is expected to
please the Singapore government, the official said.
   ``It's really not as much as they would like,'' the official
said.
   Singapore said publicly over the summer that it was interested
in hosting the Americans.
   In June, a military survey team visited the island and submitted
a report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other agencies on the
feasibility of increased military cooperation.
   The two nations have a military agreement, allowing for U.S.
Navy ships to make port calls and Air Force planes to refuel. Some

<HEAD>India Launches First Homemade Submarine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOMBAY, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
flipped an electric switch on Saturday and a 211-foot black
cylinder splashed into the sea, the first submarine built in India.
   The sub is a version of two other vessels built for India by the
West German firm Howaldtswerke Deutsche Weft. The first two were
built in Germany, but a contract called for Saturday's sub and one
more vessel to be built in India.
   Gandhi and his wife, Sonia, were among the dignitaries present.
The prime minister said ``technology must not only be borrowed. It
must also be improved and improvised lest we be saddled with
outdated equipment.''
   The $94 million vessel was named the Shalki, after a fish.
   The contract with the German firm has been steeped in
controversy. News reports have alleged that an Indian agent was
paid a $23 million kickback for the contract.
   Defense Minister V.P. Singh announced he had launched a probe
into alleaged kickbacks in defense contracts. Singh resigned from
the post April 12 after members of Gandhi's Congress Party accused
him of attempting to embarrass the government with the
investigations.
   Singh subsequently formed his own party and is now running for
the prime minister's post in general elections that must be held by
the end of the year.

   You now have just one year to cash your
federal government check.
   Until now, a government check was good indefinitely. But a new
law going into effect Sunday requires recipients to cash their
checks within 12 months.
   ``Americans are sitting on more than $2.5 billion of U.S.
government checks'' more than a year old, according to Andy
Montgomery, a spokesman for the Treasury Department's Financial
Management Service.
   ``There are nearly 6 million of those checks out there _ in
boxes, desk drawers, attics, you name it,'' he said. ``Some are
decades old.''
   The Financial Management Services said that 427 pre-1956 checks
averaging $65.42 were presented for payment during 1988. Many of
them, it said, were found by recipients or their estates who came
to the service to determine whether the checks were still ``good.''
   The oldest check was issued to a woman in Nebraska on April 15,
1919, for $1.01 in interest on World War I Liberty bonds. She was
not identified.
   The largest check was made out to a Michigan man for $8,606 in
unspecified compensation on April 9, 1954. The smallest was a
2-cent tax refund issued to a Massachusetts man on April 19, 1946.
   To remind recipients of the new time limit for cashing
government checks, checks dated Oct. 1 and later will bear the
phrase, ``VOID AFTER ONE YEAR.'' The new law also requires that
checks written prior to Oct. 1 be cashed no later than Sept. 30,
1990.
   The Financial Management Service emphasized, however, the time
limit does not affect the government's liability. But if the time
limit is exceeded, the person holding the cancelled check will have
to apply to the agency that wrote it for a replacement rather than
just take it to a bank and cash it.
   The new law also allows a one-year period during which a claim
involving a lost or stolen check may be filed.
   At the same time, the Treasury Department has 18 months to begin
recovery from a financial institution of funds involving a forged
or unauthorized check.
   Financial Management Service Commissioner W. E. Douglas said the
new law ``brings the federal government more in line with business
and local government practices.''
   ``Not only is it a poor business practice to keep the
government's books open `forever,' it is also expensive to maintain
the records,'' he said. ``And it's the taxpayers who have to pick
up that tab.''

   Hundreds of black and mixed-race
people picnicked and swam at whites-only beaches near Cape Town and
Port Elizabeth today as clergymen declared that God meant the sand
and water for everyone.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, wearing a yellow sun-hat with
the slogan, ``Free the Beaches,'' and a T-shirt saying, ``Just Call
Me Arch,'' confronted police who had initially ordered some of the
crowd of 1,500 to leave the beach in the conservative seaside town
of Strand, 20 miles east of Cape Town.
   Some families left during the discussion but most stayed,
opening their picnic lunches, swimming and wading in the water,
while 100 white people watched from the roadside. Police took no
action.
   ``I hope that the inhabitants of the Strand will realize that we
have liberated them,'' Tutu said. ``They don't have to watch
whether black people are walking on their beaches any longer. They
will enjoy the liberation of being able to share.''
   He said the black beachgoers were ``making sure they had staked
their claim properly. They walked around and wet their feet in
God's water.''
   About 1,000 people of all races gathered peacefully under heavy
police supervision in Port Elizabeth, in the eastern Cape province,
dancing and singing as a sign was erected declaring the end of
apartheid on Pollock Beach, reserved for whites for about 35 years.
   Seven buses brought black people from townships 10 miles north
of Port Elizabeth, where the City Council has asked that all
beaches under its jurisdiction be desegregated. The provincial
administrator, who is appointed by the National Party government,
has refused.
   Former Mayor Graham Richards erected the sign on a post in the
sand while a crowd gathered to hear prayers, speeches and poetry
readings. Other black and white beachgoers swam and sat in the sun.
   ``This mass non-racial picnic reminds us who we are, that we are
God's family. It is human selfishness and greed that makes beaches
for whites only,'' said the Rev. David Vika, of the
Interdenominational Ministers Association.
   The homemade sign, in black lettering on a white background, was
made to look like the nearby municipal posts which declare the
beach is for whites only. But the new sign said, ``We the people of
Port Elizabeth hereby declare Pollock Beach open for the use of all
people. By order.''
   A magistrate gave permission for the Port Elizabeth
demonstration, which was planned to last all day, but no approval
was sought for the protest at the Strand, and police initially
tried to stop the black and mixed-race families from getting to the
beach.
   Police pulled their vans up on the sand and gave the people a
few minutes to leave, then took foreign television crews and local
photographs away to a nearby police station, where they were set
free.
   Tutu told a news conference later he was afraid when police took
the journalists away they planned to use force against the crowd.
Tutu said that when thousands of blacks tried to get to the Strand
beach on Aug. 19 police used whips and dogs to drive them away.
   Police maintained a high profile, standing on the beach and
watching the crowds until the afternoon, but many began smiling,
and waved as they left, when the crowds thinned out, according to
the South African Press Association.
   On Friday, 20,000 anti-apartheid demonstrators marched in
southeastern King William's Town to protest apartheid and police
brutality. No violence was reported during the demonstration, which
received official permission.

   Lebanese lawmakers meeting in Saudi
Arabia seek to end more than 14 years of civil war in their
homeland, a task that has defeated would-be peacemakers since 1975.
   On the face of it, the meeting between Lebanon's Christian and
Moslem legislators appears to have as little chance of success as
earlier efforts to end a war in which more than 150,000 people have
been killed.
   The Maronite Catholics, the main Christian sect that has
dominated the government since independence from France in 1943,
say they will not agree to political reforms until there are
guarantees of a withdrawal by Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon.
   The Syrians, not party to the Saudi Arabian meeting but present
in spirit, say they will not pull out until the Christians share
power equally with the Damascus-backed Moslems.
   The Syrians entered Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab League mandate
to quell the civil war. They failed, but have used that
increasingly tattered mandate to justify staying in Lebanon.
   Even if the legislators meeting under Arab League auspices do
reach agreement, there are no guarantees that Lebanon's Christian
and Moslem warlords will heed any accord.
   To be sure, the initiative, the most intensive Arab effort so
far mounted to snuff out the civil war, has achieved a cease-fire
that halted six months of artillery battles between the Syrians and
Christian forces led by Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Many Lebanese are weary of a war that has dismembered their
country. But major obstacles that have been insurmountable in the
past remain. Key Lebanese leaders on both sides have criticized the
Arab League's peace plan.
   More significantly, there are the regional powers who have
repeatedly intervened in Lebanon, fanning the flames of war when it
suited their purposes.
   Syria, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Libya and the Palestinians have all
turned Lebanon into a proxy battleground for their feuds.
   It is this Gordian Knot of foreign meddling, as well as the deep
rooted hostility among Lebanon's militia leaders, that has stymied
the peacemakers in the past, leaving tiny Lebanon prey to the wider
strategies of more powerful states.
   Aoun, isolated and outnumbered, had little choice but to accept
the cease-fire, but believes there can be no peace while the
Syrians remain in Lebanon.
   He says he is prepared to make concessions but has pressured
Christian legislators to give nothing away until the Arab League
guarantees a Syrian withdrawal, something it has not been able to
do.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad, stubbornly determined to hold onto
Lebanon after a series of political setbacks that have undermined
his prestige, clearly stonewalled the Arab League into not making a
Syrian withdrawal an issue.
   ``It is glaringly obvious that the Arab League statement does
not even employ the word `withdrawal' in relation to future Syrian
troop movements,'' said Charles Snow, an analyst with the respected
Middle East Economic Survey.
   ``In this, as in virtually all its other proposals, the
initiative represents little more than an open-ended endorsement of
Syria's stated aims in Lebanon.''
   Syria, long the main power broker in Lebanon, considers its
neighbor to be vital to its strategic interests as a buffer on its
vulnerable western flank against Israel.
   Assad has also linked a withdrawal to a pullout by the Israelis,
who occupy a border strip in south Lebanon, and to the return of
the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967 and later annexed.
   All efforts to persuade the Israelis to abandon these
territories have failed and there is nothing to indicate that
anything has changed.
   Iraq, Syria's archrival in the Arab world, has backed Aoun for
no other reason than to take revenge on Assad for supporting Iran
during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war and to bog down the Syrians in
the Lebanese quagmire.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's objective is nothing less than
undermining Assad's prestige in the Arab world and within Syria,
where he faces severe economic woes, to bring him down.
   ``Aoun's Iraqi backers are doubtless willing to fight to the
last Maronite in Lebanon'' to cripple Assad, Snow commented.
   Saudi Arabia, a member of the three-member Arab League committee
mediating to end the Lebanese carnage, could pressure Assad to back
off because it is the only Arab state still bankrolling radical
Syria.
   But the Saudis remain suspicious of Saddam's revived regional
ambitions following the Persian Gulf cease-fire and look to Syria
as a counterweight.
   Druse Moslem leader Walid Jumblatt has declared that the
proposed reforms do not go far enough in stripping the Maronites of
their traditional powers.
   ``The military battle is not yet over,'' he declared.
   Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Moslem Amal militia and a
major Syrian ally, also says the proposed reforms are ``not
enough'' because they envision splitting power equally between
Christians and Moslems.
   The 1.2 million-strong Shiites, long downtrodden but now
Lebanon's largest sect, demand the greatest share of power.
   Syria has used its alliance with Iran to put pressure on Aoun.
   Tehran and Damascus have publicly proclaimed solidarity. But
Syria is a secular socialist state that has ruthlessly crushed
Islamic fundamentalist dissidents who have much in common with
predominantly Shiite Iran.
   The Tehran Times daily, which often reflects the thinking of
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, stressed that Syria must
``make sincere efforts ... to establish political justice'' in
Lebanon, a clear statement of support for the Shiites, or fighting
``with vaster dimensions'' would erupt again.
   ``The Syrians must admit that there is a difference between
fighting against Zionism and imperialism and occupying a
neighboring country,'' it declared.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, apparently
hopes to restore Iran's relations with the West and appears to be
trying to rein in revolutionary radicals who back Shiite militants
in Lebanon holding most of 16 Western hostages.
   The Americans hope Rafsanjani's emergence will herald the
release of eight U.S. captives and don't want to antagonize Iran or
Syria, much to Aoun's chagrin.
   Rafsanjani is supported by some Lebanese Shiites. But the
hardliners holding the hostages remain loyal to Tehran's
anti-Western radicals, who could use them to keep Lebanon on the
boil to jeopardize Rafsanjani's efforts.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is citing ``a threat
to presidential authority'' in a legal motion to block access by
private groups to White House records stored on computer tapes such
as those that figured in the Iran-Contra affair.
   The Justice Department said in its motion that a Sept. 15
decision by U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey permitting
citizens to sue the president to block destruction of the tapes is
``of extreme significance'' to the president's ability to carry out
his constitutional duties.
   In addition, department lawyers argued in the motion filed
Wednesday, the decision ``has far-reaching impact for the
government as a whole'' because of the widespread use of computers.
   ``Making that determination for literally hundreds of thousands
of computer entries is simply not feasible,'' the department said.
   At issue is whether such tapes might contain information that
must be preserved under the Presidential Records Act passed in
1978. The White House maintains that it gave employes adequate
guidelines to determine whether specific computer messages were
important enough to be preserved as presidential records.
   Richey, however, said that at least some of the messages that
had been slated for destruction ``may qualify for retention under
the pertinent recordkeeping statutes.''
   The department is asking Richey to have the decision sent
directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals instead of having further
proceedings in the trial court. which is hearing a lawsuit filed on
the next-to-last day of the Reagan administration.
   The National Security Archives, a Washington nonprofit group
that researches national security issues, sued to prevent the
scheduled destruction of 12 days worth of electronic messages in a
system used by more than 300 employee in the National Security
Council and other agencies of the Executive Office of the President.
   Investigators used such computer tapes to reconstruct evidence
in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Lawyers for the National Security Archives have said that if the
appeal is not granted, they will ask the White House to describe
the general contents of the tapes through the legal process of
discovery in preparation for a trial.
   If the appeal is granted and the appeals court overrules Richey,
the Justice Department said the parties would be ``spared the
burden of unnecessary and particularly troubling discovery.''
   The department said the stepped-up appeal process ``is
especially appropriate'' because of the ``threat to the president's
authority.''
   ``Requiring defendants to await a final decision after further
prolonged litigation would be disruptive of the president's
ability'' to carry out his duties under the Constitution, the
department said.
   The department lawyers said that as far as they could find out
this is the first case ever to consider whether the president is
subject to suit under the Administrative Practices Act, as Richey
said he is.
   The act has in the past been used to enable individuals to
challenge ``arbitrary and capricious'' actions by agencies of the
executive branch.
   The Justice Department said in its motion that the plaintiffs in
the case apparently seek to establish whether, for each computer
entry, ``each individual employee faithfully applied statutory
criteria to determine the `record' status of entries and then
preserved `record' information.''
   Other plaintiffs in the suit include the American Library
Association, the American Historical Association, the Center for
National Security Studies of the American Civil Liberties Union and
several individuals.
   The plaintiffs have until Oct. 9 to reply to the motion.

   A British soldier was charged
Saturday with leaking confidential photographs, names and addresses
of suspected terrorists, and was released on bail.
   Shaun Robert Cunliffe, 20, of the Air Defense Regiment Royal
Artillery, based at Dortmund, West Germany, was accused under the
Official Secrets Act.
   He was charged with leaking the photographs, names and addresses
of certain people entrusted in confidence to him between Sept. 17
and Sept. 21. Bail was set at $80 and he was released to the
custody of the army.
   Prosecutors did not indicate who received the documents
allegedly disclosed by Cunliffe. Lists of suspects have been sent
to newspapers and politicians.
   Cunliffe was the first person to face charges since a rash of
leaks of confidential police and army documents listing suspected
members of the Irish Republican Army.
   Persons claiming to be Protestant gunmen have claimed that they
used such documents to pick targets, including a Roman Catholic man
who was murdered in August.
   Two members of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a locally raised
unit of the British army, have been charged with that slaying.

<TEXT>
   A local television viewer wants so badly to
see ``The Last Temptation of Christ'' he is suing a cable company
that decided not to show the controversial film.
   Felix H. Olim of suburban Midwest City filed suit Friday in
federal court here to force Multimedia Cablevision to show the film
on Cinemax when it is telecast for the rest of the country. He also
wants $1 million in damages.
   Multimedia announced Monday it would not telecast ``The Last
Temptation'' in Oklahoma, Kansas and North Carolina when it appears
on the premium channel.
   The suit says Multimedia ``infringed upon the religious rights
of its 90,000 subscribers'' by deciding to pre-empt the program.
   ``Whoever wishes not to view this or any transmission, always
has the option of choosing another channel, or turning off his
set,'' Olim said.
   Cinemax will broadcast the movie nationwide Monday and on four
other dates in October.
   The Oscar-nominated ``Last Temptation'' sparked national
protests when it was released 14 months ago because it portrayed
Jesus as confused over his identity and purpose and subject to
human desires.
   Meanwhile, Oklahoma State University regents postponed a showing
of the film by a student group on the Stillwater campus while they
attempted to decide if it is appropriate for a state-funded campus.
Plans for the showing had prompted at least threat of violence.
   An American Civil Liberties Union attorney said the group would
sue the university if the showing of the film is blocked, and Gov.
Henry Bellmon has told the regents it would be inappropriate to
censor the film.
   But state Rep. Bill Graves warned showing the film might violate
a 1910 Oklahoma law prohibiting blasphemy.

   Quicker than Robin could say ``Holy Copyright
Infringement, Batman!'' counterfeit copies of the smash movie
surfaced in Thailand's black markets.
   Although Japan and Hong Kong have cracked down on video piracy,
the rest of Asia remains the world's hub for such counterfeits,
copyright experts said Saturday at a seminar sponsored by the Third
Tokyo International Film Festival.
   Video piracy, the illegal taping of copyrighted videos, cost the
U.S. film industry $740 million last year.
   Copyright experts and government officials from Japan and Hong
Kong reported recent successes in controlling video piracy within
their borders.
   But China, where a video-cassette recorder costs 22 times an
average worker's annual income, is only now beginning to face the
problem, said Dai Qun, director of the Office of the Film Bureau.
China has 26,000 theaters where videotapes are shown to the public.
It also has 26,000 legitimate movie houses.
   In Thailand, video piracy is uncontrollable because copyright
laws are not enforced, said Lursak Thavornvanit, director of the
Thai Intellectual Property Protection Organization.
   ```Batman' appeared on the Thai black market just days after its
U.S. release,'' he told an audience of 400 video makers and
distributors.
   ``It's very difficult for anyone to do a legitimate business
because the pirates are so good and so efficient at managing the
market, and no one can afford to pay for the legitimate tapes,'' he
said.
   Pirated videos, which first appeared in 1983, have been
illegally duplicated or dubbed, either from legitimate copies or
from movie or television screens. They are sold or rented in video
stores at a fraction of the cost of legitimate copies or shown in
public places such as hotels and restaurants without payment to the
copyright owners, usually the films' producers.
   In Tokyo, a legitimate video tape rents for about $7, while a
pirated copy costs about $2. Nevertheless, Japan's video watchdog
group says the number of shops offering pirated videos has
plummeted in the last two years.
   Between 60 percent and 70 percent of the 12,000 video stores in
Japan sold pirated videos in 1987, but that number has declined to
30 percent, mostly because of tougher enforcement of copyright laws
and a beefed-up law that makes it illegal to possess pirated tapes,
said Tomohiro Tohyama, legal director of the Japan Federation
Against Copyright Theft.
   The criminal penalties under the revised Copyright Law are
imprisonment for up to three years or a $7,200 fine, but no
violators have ever gone to jail.
   Still, Tohyama thinks the law has been effective. ``It is almost
impossible to find a shop these days stocked 100 percent with
pirated videos. That wasn't true two years ago.''
   Tohyama said his organization's main goal _ to halt all home
taping of videos _ could take as long as 20 years. ``The Japanese
public simply doesn't understand copying videos is stealing, even
though it is intangible property.''
   American movies are popular fare in Japan, the U.S. film
industry's largest export target. Last year, almost three times as
many U.S. films were shown as Japanese films, according to the
Motion Picture Association of America.
   The top four grossing films in Japanese history are ``ET,''
``Star Wars,'' ``Jaws,'' and ``Ghostbusters,'' according to
industry statistics.
   Elsewhere in Asia ``Rambo'' can be seen in isolationist Burma,
and ``The Last Emperor'' was widely shown in China.
   Some South Korean filmmakers are so threatened by the weighty
competition of American movies that they allegedly ordered the
release of snakes and tear gas into theaters showing U.S. films.
   Videotapes of such U.S. blockbusters a ``Rambo,'' smuggled in by
boat through Vietnam's long coastline, are popular black market
items there.

   Notwithstanding charges it is being too timid,
the Bush administration is resisting calls for the United States to
directly spend billions of dollars to aid Poland's historic attempt
to transform its economy from communism to capitalism.
   It's not that President Bush doesn't want the Poles to succeed.
   In an address last week to the 152-nation International Monetary
Fund and its sister organization, the World Bank, Bush hailed
developments in Eastern Europe as ``stunning.''
   ``There is no greater opportunity before us all today than the
challenge of Poland,'' he said.
   ``We must do more,'' he said.
   On the other hand, Bush mentioned no specific figure for U.S.
aid beyond the $219 million already announced.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., called the president's proposal
``pathetically timid'' and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said the ``administration's timidity ... is puzzling and
dismaying.''
   ``Bush is saying he wants to provide assistance to a newly
reformed system, but the bottom line is, `Where's the beef? Where
is the money?''' said Joseph Pelzman, professor of economics at
George Washington University.
   The president reportedly is considering additional U.S. aid, but
the administration seems inclined to channel most Western help
through the IMF and World Bank.
   The key word in Bush's speech last week was ``we.'' He was
speaking to the world, not just to Americans.
   ``The United States might kick in some more food aid from time
to time and put aside some scholarships, but in terms of cash aid,
it's going to work through the World Bank and IMF,'' said economics
professor Howard Wachtel of American University.
   A Treasury official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Friday, ``The Bush administration believes that the World Bank and
IMF have particularly important roles to play in supporting
economic reform in Poland, both through policy advice and financial
support.''
   Academic experts on the subject say there are a number of
advantages to this approach, both political and budgetary.
   ``It is a way to provide burden sharing and there is nothing
wrong with that,'' Pelzman said.
   Western European democracies have as much, if not more, reason
than the United States to help Poland succeed.
   Another advantage lies in the technicalities of how the IMF
raises its money. The fund assesses each member a quota, which the
countries supply from their reserves. The quota can be withdrawn on
demand, so it doesn't count as spending for U.S. budget purposes.
   Additional direct U.S. aid, unlike an increase in IMF quotas,
would mean the administration and Congress would have to cut
elsewhere to meet the requirements of the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   Indeed, IMF officials, who are seeking agreement by the end of
the year to double the fund's resources from $120 billion to $240
billion, are hoping U.S. desire to aid Eastern Europe will help
persuade the United States to accede to a substantial quota
increase.
   But, perhaps the most important factors in the administration's
thinking are political, both international and domestic.
   If the United States charges too strongly into Poland, it could
rattle the Soviet Union, already nervous about the Solidarity-led
government that took office Aug. 24.
   Also, Polish officials are beginning what at least initially
will be a jarring reform program causing widespread unemployment
and other disruptions as inefficient state-run enterprises are
forced to operate in a competitive system for the first time.
   The IMF, in exchange for its assistance, normally insists that
countries follow through on promised reforms. It acts as sort of an
international enforcer. That's in line with what the United States
wants, but the administration is not eager for the flak that
accompanies the tough cop role.
   One of the reasons Congress is so keen on aiding Poland is the
millions of Americans of Polish descent who closely watch
conditions in their native land.
   Having the IMF take the lead ``gives the United States political
cover. It puts the IMF out front. They take the flak if there are
criticisms to be taken,'' Wachtel said.
   ``You don't want to make the Americans look as if they are the
ones making the (Polish) population eat less,'' added Pelzman.
   But there's a danger in relying too much on international
organizations more accustomed to dealing with Third World countries
with underdeveloped free enterprise systems than with centrally
planned economies operating with no experience in free markets,
Wachtel said.
   ``The IMF and World Bank can make some very big mistakes if they
simply parachute in their standard program where it's not suited,''
he said.

<HEAD>One `Debugging' Option: Built Annex For Top-Secret Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James Baker III is close to
making his decision on the fate of the bug-riddled U.S. Embassy
building in Moscow, with one key option being to construct an annex
for top-secret business, officials say.
   But some members of Congress might balk at that idea as ``empire
building,'' said Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, a congressional
expert on the embassy debacle.
   ``It would look like we're rewarding the State Department for
exorbitant mistakes in the past,'' she said. ``They have to justify
the need'' for a new building, she said.
   Officials at the State Department said Baker's decision on the
multimillion-dollar fiasco could come this week.
   ``Baker is nearly ready to make a decision. The intelligence
community has signed onto a plan,'' said one department official,
speaking on condition he remain anonymous.
   But he said Baker has not approved the proposal, which would
then be sent to President Bush before it is transmitted to Congress.
   Baker's dilemma, which he inherited from the Reagan
administration, is what should be done with the bug-infested,
red-brick building that has never been used by American diplomats.
   Listening devices and eavesdropping equipment were discovered in
the building in 1985, 13 years after the United States and the
Soviet Union signed a construction agreement that allowed Soviet
builders to do the job.
   Over the past four years, State Department officials have
floated a number of possible options for the building, known in
Washington circles as the NOB, or New Office Building.
   They include razing the building and replacing it with a secure
facility; ripping out only the top floors to make them bug-free, or
constructing a new annex as a place for secret talks and
transmissions.
   In April, two key department officials, Ambassador Nicholas
Salgo and Ivan Selin, undersecretary for management, told Baker
that constructing an annex would be cheaper than the estimated $500
million that might be needed to tear down the NOB and replace it.
   The annex idea follows a recommendation by James Schlesinger,
the former defense secretary, who prepared a report on the embassy
for the Reagan administration. He also suggested making the top
three floors of the existing building secure.
   A month before Bush was elected, former President Reagan
advocated razing the building, saying the United States had ``no
choice'' but to do so.
   But congressional sources, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, say the annex solution now appears high on the
department's agenda.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, chairman of the House panel that
appropriates money for the State Department, said one possibility
being discussed is for the United States to buy the so-called
``change'' building _ the place Russian workers changed clothes _
that is situated between the old U.S. Embassy building and the new
building.
   The change building would be torn down and replaced with a
secure annex. The bugged building could then be used for other
purposes, perhaps a cultural center, a visa office or an office for
visiting American business executives.
   The department has not asked for additional money for the
embassy building in the 1990 fiscal year.
   If Baker endorses building an annex, members of Congress will
have some tough questions for the department, Snowe said. For one,
they will want to know what the department intends to do with the
extra space.
   ``What do we do with the existing building, what do we do with
the building they are in now?'' she asked.
   Another difficulty is the U.S.-Soviet reciprocity agreement that
would give the Soviets the right to demand additional space in
Washington, she said. The United States barred the Soviets from
occupying their new embassy in Washington after the Moscow problems
were uncovered.
   Other congressional sources said there are sure to be questions
about how to protect those who worked in the annex. Those dealing
with sensitive material would be easily identifiable, they said.
   Regardless of Baker's decisions, officials said it would take
several more years before the situation is resolved.

<TEXT>
   More than a week after a school bus careened
over the unguarded lip of a 40-foot-deep pit, killing 21 students,
visitors stop to pray and light candles at the site.
   Ernestina Garcia brought 20 candles, each in a paper sack that
glowed at the edge of the chasm, filled with about 12 feet of
stagnant water.
   ``We usually do this at Christmas, and I thought it would be a
nice thing to do for the kids,'' she said one evening last week.
   Her friend Rose Mary Rios was back the next morning, exactly a
week after the Sept. 21 crash, happy to see that the candles had
burned all night.
   Neither woman had children on the bus, but both knew victims in
the small, South Texas community of Alton, where the tragedy is
still too horrible for some to believe.
   ``It's going to take some time,'' said Mayor San Juanita Zamora.
``It will take time.''
   Activities at Mission Junior High and Mission High School, where
the victims and 59 survivors attended, were returning to normal by
the end of the week. Football resumed with a junior high game
Thursday afternoon.
   Then Friday, the community was shaken again when 15-year-old
Elizabeth Flores died at Mission Hospital, becoming the 21st
fatality. She had been in a coma and on life-support systems since
the accident.
   But Friday night's football games went on. Keeping the students
busy and moving ahead with life are the best remedies, said head
football coach Sonny Detmer of Mission High School.
   ``It's a terrible thing it had to happen, but at least it
happened during football season,'' the coach said. ``If it had
happened any other time of the year it would have been depression
until football season started again.''
   ``You can't tell them to forget it, because there's no way
they're ever going to forget it,'' Detmer said. ``You just tell
them to go on.''
   Counselors in the region mobilized and will continue to help the
students, their teachers and families and others in the grieving
community, officials said.
   ``We've had several teachers who I would say took it harder than
the kids,'' said John Abbenante, junior high principal.
   He started the week with an emotional talk over the school's
public address system, while tearful teachers and counselors
embraced shaken survivors and their friends.
   More and more survivors came back to school, some by bus, as the
week progressed, he said, but a few found it impossible to stay all
day.
   Juan V. Granados, 12, who escaped through a window in the bus,
has started going to school in his father's car, and didn't know if
he would become a bus rider again.
   ``Maybe,'' he said.
   Some of the scores of rescuers also have had trouble coping with
the sight of so many young people dying. A group counseling session
with the Charter Palms Hospital of McAllen helped, said Shawn
Snider, an emergency medical technician with the Alamo Fire
Department who cannot remember any of the dead children's faces.
   A dramatic Associated Press picture transmitted around the world
showed Snider and another rescuer as one of them tried to
resuscitate a student pulled from the murky waters. Snider said the
boy did not live.
   ``When I looked over that cliff and saw all that yellow (the
submerged bus), it was like somebody hit me with a 2-by-4, and I
started shaking,'' said Snider, who thought he was used to seeing
trauma victims. ``Everybody's dealing with it. Everybody's having a
hard time.''
   Red Cross volunteer Anna Rubio said the organization would be
around for a long time helping victims' families, citing a parent
``who has not worked for a week and will need gas money.'' The
organization is using a trailer at Alton Elementary for its
operations.
   Daniel Rodriguez, father of 16-year-old victim Ana Delia
Rodriguez, said his main concern was obtaining a headstone for his
daughter's grave.
   Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co., owner of the truck that went
through a stop sign and knocked the bus into the pit, offered to
pay funeral and medical costs for victims and survivors.
   At least one lawsuit has been filed against the company, with
others in the works, according to lawyers.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is winding down its
investigation but probably will not have a report out for nine
months, said chief investigator Bob Barlett. The NTSB has concluded
that the truck's brakes worked well enough to halt it at the stop
sign in Alton.
   No charges, however, have been filed against the truck driver,
25-year-old Ruben Perez of Mission, on administrative suspension
from his duties.
   No guard rail separated the pit from the roadway 20 feet away
and no road signs warned of its presence, but authorities said that
was not unusual in south Texas. The pit was one of thousands dug in
the Southwest to mine caliche, a sandy gravel mixture that occurs
naturally in desert areas and is used for construction.
   Hidalgo County officials are talking about ways to make the pits
safer.
   Residents are discussing a memorial at the site, which along
with candles has been marked by several wreaths. Other reminders of
the tragedy are a child's red tennis shoe, two T-shirts, the
remnants of notebook paper and a blue ballpoint pen floating on the
water's surface.

<HEAD>Colombia Reportedly Pressing Ahead With Extradition; Schools Bombed</HEAD>

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The government plans to extradite a second
drug trafficking suspect to the United States, Colombian news
reports said Saturday, and another reputed narcotics figure has
been arrested in Ecuador.
   Meanwhile, tougher security measures failed to halt the wave of
bombings blamed on cocaine barons.Police said five people were
injured in seven explosions Friday in the capital and the western
city of Cali.
   In Ecuador on Saturday, police said a leading Colombian drug
trafficker, Evaristo Porras Ardila, was arrested and will be
extradited to Colombia after an investigation is completed.
   A high-ranking police official in Quito, the capital, said on
condition of anonymity that Porras Ardila was arrested Thursday in
Tulcan, near the Colombian border.
   El Tiempo, Colombia's largest daily, reported Saturday that the
Justice Ministry on Friday told another drug trafficking suspect,
Ana Helena Rodriguez, that she will be extradited to Florida.
   The Associated Press was unable to confirm the report with the
Justice Ministry, which was closed Saturday.
   Ms. Rodriguez would have until next Friday to appeal. She faces
charges of cocaine trafficking and money laundering.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in
Miami, said Ms. Rodriguez was one of several defendants in a 1983
drug smuggling case but that she did not have further details.
   She said Colombian authorities previously identified Ms.
Rodriguez as the girlfriend of a well-known trafficker.
   Ms. Rodriguez would be the second Colombian extradited to the
United States since President Virgilio Barco ordered government
security forces to crush two powerful drug cartels six weeks ago.
   Eduardo Martinez Romero was flown to Atlanta Sept. 6 to face
charges of laundering drug money.
   Up to 80 percent of Colombia's cocaine is smuggled into the
United States.
   The U.S. Justice Department has said it wants about 80
Colombians extradited, including 12 major drug trafficking suspects
who allegedly run the Cali and Medellin drug cartels, named after
Colombian cities where they have headquarters.
   Porras Ardila, Martinez and Ms. Rodriguez are not among the 12
key drug figures.
   Barco ordered the crackdown on the cartels after Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan, a leading presidential candidate and outspoken foe of
drug trafficking, was assassinated Aug. 18.
   The traffickers responded by declaring war on the government,
and they said in a communique earlier this month that they would
prefer a grave in Colombia to a jail cell in the United States.
   In the past month there have been 125 bombings that have killed
10 people and injured 147. Terrorists stepped up the bombings last
week and started attacking hotels and schools.
   On Friday, security forces in Bogota stepped up their searches
of cars for guns and explosives, but four government-run schools
were bombed in the evening, the national police said in a
communique. The schools were closed, but the blasts injured three
passers-by, including a woman and two children, the police said.
   They said there was a fifth blast in the capital at a bank
branch. No injuries were reported.
   Many of the bombs have been thrown by passengers on motorcycles.
Mayor Andres Pastrana said Friday night in a communique that no
more than one person be on a motorcycle in the capital.
   In Cali, two people were injured when a bomb exploded at a
department store, police said by telephone. There was another blast
at a small grocery store across the street from an air force base
on the outskirts of the city, but no one was hurt, police said.

<HEAD>New Ukraine Party Leader Pledges to Get Republic Moving</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new head of the nation's second-largest
republic pledged in an interview published Saturday to attack acute
housing and food shortages that built up during the 17-year rule of
his conservative predecessor.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda also printed an interview with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in which he gave lukewarm thanks to
outgoing Ukrainian leader and conservative Politburo member
Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, indicating the differences that colored
the men's relationship.
   ``The tempo of renewal in various spheres of life in the
republic ... is clearly insufficient,'' new party leader Vladimir
A. Ivashko told Pravda in his first published comments since being
chosen Thursday to replace Shcherbitsky.
   ``The people are very dissatisfied,'' said the new chief of the
republic that is home to 50 million people, the Soviet breadbasket
and an important coal-producing and industrial area.
   He ticked off a half-dozen priorities that included improved
housing, food supplies, consumer goods, health care, the
environment and nuclear energy problems linked to the Chernobyl
nuclear power accident in 1986 and the construction of another
nuclear plant in the Crimea.
   Ivashko also pledged to allow the full development of Ukrainian
culture, a sign he is likely to be more inclined toward compromise
with those who are pushing for preservation of the Ukrainian
language and demanding more economic and political autonomy.
   The Ivashko, 56, seen as a supporter of Gorbachev's reforms,
said one of his main tasks will be to work out a program of the
Ukraine's economic independence within the framework of the Soviet
economy.
   Shcherbitsky, 71, the last Politburo holdover from the regime of
President Leonid I. Brezhnev, was intolerant of dissident.
   However, under Gorbachev's reform policy, Ukrainians began
making the same demands as other ethnic activists in the Soviet
Union, and in early September they held the founding meeting of the
Rukh political movement. The grassroots political movement
professes support for Gorbachev's reforms but that in some cases
goes further in demanding democratic reforms and local control.
   Echoing Gorbachev, Ivashko said one of his most important tasks
would be to strengthen the party so that it does not lose
initiative at a time when many informal political groups are
placing demands before it and the government.
   There had been many reports in the past several years that
Shcherbitsky was being forced out by Gorbachev, but he held on to
his job until he and two other Politburo members were eased out of
the country's ruling body on Sept. 20. Ukrainian party leaders
chose Ivashko in secret balloting on Sept. 28.
   In rather brief remarks about Shcherbitsky, Gorbachev told
Pravda the retired leader's many years of party work ``deserved a
high evaluation.''
   Gorbachev, who took part in the Ukrainian party meeting at which
Shcherbitsky retired, said party leaders praised the former leader
``as a person who worked very hard, and was not satisfied with what
was achieved.''
   Gorbachev indicated that Shcherbitsky's age and health were
among the reasons he was relieved.
   Shcherbitsky told Pravda that Ivashko had all the necessary
qualities to run the Ukraine and that he would justify the trust of
party leaders.

   Cambodian guerrillas claimed
Saturday to have scored their biggest victory in 10 years with the
capture of three towns and 10 other government positions.
   Specific claims could not be confirmed by independent sources.
But Western sources at the Thai-Cambodian border confirmed that one
guerrilla faction, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front,
made major gains against Cambodian government forces.
   ``We will know more in the next couple of days; at the moment it
is difficult to judge how much is true and how much is
propaganda,'' a Western relief official based in Aranyaprathet said
on condition of anonymity.
   The claims came less than a week after Vietnam said its last
troops had left Cambodia, where they fought the guerrillas for more
than a decade.
   Abdulgaffar Peang-Meth, spokesman for the Liberation Front, said
5,000 fighters launched attacks against five towns and other
positions along Highway 69, which runs parallel to the
Thai-Cambodian border in northwestern Cambodia.
   A second guerrilla faction, loyal to resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, said it had joined the Liberation Front in a
``general offensive'' and had taken part in some of the fighting on
Saturday.
   A Sihanouk spokesman, Bounthy Ung, said the Khmer Rouge _ the
Communist faction in the three-faction coalition _ had not joined
in the fighting.
   The groups are fighting the Cambodian government in a loose
coalition led by Sihanouk.
   The Western relief official said heavy shelling could be heard
during the day near Aranyaprathet, a key border town.
   The acting Liberation Front commander-in-chief, Gen. Dien Del,
said the insurgents damaged a number of tanks, overran 10 Phnom
Penh army positions flanking Highway 69 and seized the district
capital of Thmar Puok, which the Vietnamese army had left just six
days ago as part of its withdrawal from Cambodia.
   Bounthy Ung also said the fighters had taken Phom Srok, a
district seat about 40 miles inside Cambodia from the Thai border.
Dien Del said the insurgents also seized Banteay Chmar and found a
warehouse containing 1,000 weapons and other military hardware.
   The general said his forces were closing in on two other towns,
Svey Chiek and Kandoun, and had surrounded Sisophon, at the
strategic crossroad of Highway 69 and national Route 5, which leads
to Phnom Penh.
   Dien Del said the guerrillas intended to test the strength of
the Cambodian government and ``force Phnom Penh to the negotiating
table. Today is a very big day for the KPNLF. It is the largest
victory in 10 years.''
   He said the attackers suffered few casualties.
   A Western diplomat who requested anonymity questioned whether
the guerrillas would be able to hold onto their gains.
   The Liberation Front, reportedly using conventional war tactics
rather than guerrilla-style ones in the attacks, is armed with
light-infantry weapons and newly acquired 84mm anti-tank rockets.
   The Soviet-supplied Cambodian army has tanks and heavy artillery.
   ``We have less war material than (the government),'' Dien Del
said, ``but we have more experience, better morale and better
training. We have been fighting for 10 years.''
   The Liberation Front claims to have more than 16,000 fighters.
The strongest guerrilla group, the Khmer Rouge, fields between
30,000 and 40,000, according to Western estimates.
   Vietnam, which invaded Cambodia and ousted the Khmer Rouge in
late 1978, said it completed the withdrawal of all its troops from
the country on Tuesday. But the guerrillas say thousands of
Vietnamese have stayed behind.
   The Khmer Rouge recently claimed a series of battle successes
against Cambodian army units. Officials in Phnom Penh have admitted
some setbacks near the town of Pailin in western Cambodia but
insist their forces can keep control of the area.
   When it was in power between 1975 and 1978, the Khmer Rouge
killed hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to impose a
radical agarian society.

<HEAD>Speaker Tells Lebanese Lawmakers They Must Find Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The speaker of Lebanon's splintered
parliament told the assembly Saturday that they have no choice but
to find a way to end their nation's 14-year cycle of bloodshed.
   Christian and Moslem lawmakers, gathered in this mountain resort
for their first meeting in more than a year, are divided over the
presence of Syrian troops backing Moslem forces in Lebanon and
Moslem demands for greater power.
   Speaker Hassan Husseini, a Shiite Moslem, told the deputies that
failure to resolve their differences would mean ``a total loss of
hope'' in the devastated country, where fighting has been halted by
a fragile truce.
   ``We have no choice but to succeed,'' he told the
parliamentarians.
   King Fahd, in an opening address read by Foreign Minister Prince
Saud al Faisal in Taif's Conference Palace, called on the feuding
Christian and Moslem parliamentarians to cooperate in finding a
settlement to the conflict in which more than 150,000 people have
been killed since 1975.
   ``Now that the situation has shifted from the arena of warriors
to the negotiators' table, it is high time we moved from trading
artillery shells and accusations to hasten the peacemaking,'' the
king's message said.
   The Saudi monarch said Lebanese must rule their own nation.
   Most of Lebanon, except an 320-square mile Christian enclave
north of Beirut, is under the control of Syria, which has 40,000
troops in Lebanon. Israel occupies a ``security zone'' of Lebanese
territory along its border.
   Fahd is a member of a three-nation committee mandated by the
22-member Arab League to bring peace and reconcile Lebanon's
feuding factions.
   Fahd, King Hassan II of Morocco and President Chadli Bendjedid
of Algeria formulated a seven-point peace plan that calls for
political reforms which the Lebanese parliamentarians will debate.
   The Taif meeting, the first by Lebanon's parliament outside the
country, was designed to reduce sectarian pressures on the
legislators that have been a major factor in the collapse of
earlier initiatives.
   Lebanese deputies who arrived in Taif late Friday said the
meeting would last from three to 10 days.
   Before the deputies left Beirut Friday, Lebanon's Moslem
government leader, Moslem Salim Hoss, said the Taif meeting ``could
be the last chance for peace in Lebanon.''
   Conference sources said 63 of Lebanon's 73 surviving legislators
_ 33 Christians and 30 Moslems _ were in Taif in Saudi Arabia's
western mountains.
   Three Shiite Moslem and seven Christian deputies failed to show
up. ``No one has refused to come, but some gave medical reasons for
not attending,'' Saud said.
   Twenty-five of the deputies in the 99-seat parliament have been
killed or died of natural causes since the last general election in
1972. The fighting has prevented elections since then.
   A cease-fire in Lebanon took effect a week ago, halting six
months of fierce artillery battles between the Syrian Army, which
backs the Moslems, and Christian forces led by Gen. Michel Aoun.
   More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded in the
fighting that included some of the most ferocious bombardments of
the war. Most of the casualties were civilians.
   The cease-fire, and the lifting of blockades by both sides, was
the first phase of the ambitious, seven-point Arab League peace
plan.
   It envisages political reforms that will give Lebanon's Moslem
majority equal power with the Christians, led by Maronites, who,
under an unwritten agreement, have dominated the government,
parliament, judiciary and army since independence from France in
1943.
   The plan also proposed increasing the number of seats in
Lebanon's parliament to 128, divided equally among Christians and
Moslems. Since independence, the Christians have had a 6-5 edge in
the House.
   In 1943, the Christians were considered the majority. But
estimates now give Moslems at least 55 percent of Lebanon's 4
million people.
   The peace plan also proposes a Syrian pullback from Moslem areas
of Beirut to the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon within two years
provided political agreement can be reached. Complete withdrawal
would follow a security pact between Syria and Lebanon.
   Some Christian legislators, pressed by Aoun, have said they will
not discuss political reforms until Syria agrees to a timetable for
a complete withdrawal.
   Syria has its troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. Aoun claims the Syrians have abrogated that
mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   Syria considers Lebanon, its western neighbor, vital to its
security.
   The peace plan envisages the Lebanese legislators electing a new
president to replace Amin Gemayel, a Maronite whose six-year term
expired Sept. 22, 1988.
   In the dying minutes of his presidency, Gemayel appointed Aoun
to head a caretaker military government. By naming a Maronite as
premier, Gemayel broke the unwritten covenant under which the
president is a Maronite, the premier a Sunni Moslem and the
parliament speaker a Shiite.
   Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment and supported the

   The colorful case of the city of Beverly
Hills vs. Zsa Zsa Gabor adds a footnote to the history of a
favorite Hollywood genre: the real-life courtroom drama.
   Slapping a macho cop in a traffic incident hardly matches the
murder, rape and paternity charges against other celebrities in
past years. But the Beverly Hills shenanigans still commanded
worldwide media coverage.
   Miss Gabor's conviction Friday on three of four misdemeanor
counts runs counter to the trend in Hollywood trials, most of which
the stars have either won or walked away from with light sentences.
Miss Gabor's sentencing is set for Oct. 17.
   Juries are often awed by celebrities and wind up deciding in
their favor, court observers say.
   The prosecutor in the ``Twilight Zone'' case said he thought the
jury was overwhelmed by the defendants' celebrity and acquitted
producer John Landis and four others. Landis was tried for the 1982
helicopter-crash deaths of actor Vic Morrow and two small children.
   Six bailiffs were needed to shield Miss Gabor as she made her
way each day to the third-floor courtroom through an international
platoon of reporters eager to gobble up the actress' daily sound
bite commentaries on the trial and life in general.
   The prosecutor, deputy district attorney Elden Fox, called the
affair ``a media circus.''
   ``This sells newspapers or TV time,'' Fox said. ``There is a
great deal of public interest in finding out how their
(celebrities') cases are resolved as opposed to Richard Ramirez or
somebody else who doesn't quite have the celebrity status.''
   A Los Angeles jury is debating whether Ramirez, the convicted
``Night Stalker'' killer, should receive the death penalty. Jurors
will resume their work Monday.
   One indication of the movieland influence in the Gabor trial was
the stage marker on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse.
   The tape marking, spelling Zsa Zsa in red letters, showed the
defendant exactly where to stand before the battery of news cameras
each day to achieve the best angle and lighting.
   Hollywood's first notorious trial actually took place in San
Francisco. One of the silent screen's most famous comics, Roscoe
``Fatty'' Arbuckle, was charged with murder when a 25-year-old
starlet fell ill during a hotel booze party and died several days
later.
   After two hung juries, Arbuckle was acquitted in a third trial
on April 12, 1922. His career never recovered. He died at 46 in
1933.
   The 1935 divorce trial of Mary Astor and Dr. Franklyn Thorpe
caused a sensation because of an alleged diary which chronicled her
affairs with top movie figures. The diary was never introduced as
evidence, and the actress denied it existed. Miss Astor went on to
star in ``The Maltese Falcon'' and many other films.
   Swashbuckling Errol Flynn was charged in 1942 with statutory
rape of two teen-age girls. Accounts of the revels aboard Flynn's
yacht were trumpeted by newspapers. Famed Hollywood defender Jerry
Giesler won an acquittal for Flynn, whose career flourished with
the notoriety.
   Young Joan Barry came to Hollywood in 1940 to crash the movies
and ended up in Charlie Chaplin's bed. After Chaplin abandoned his
``protegee,'' she turned up at his house with a gun, and police ran
her out of town. This led to a paternity suit as well as federal
charges for infringing Miss Barry's rights.
   Even though tests proved he couldn't be the father, Chaplin was
ordered to support the baby. With Giesler's help, he beat the
federal charges. Largely because of the scandal and his
left-leaning politics, the federal government revoked Chaplin's
entry permit while he was on a trip abroad several years later, and
he exiled himself to Switzerland.
   When Robert Mitchum was arrested in 1948 for smoking marijuana,
Giesler again came to the rescue. Mitchum received two months in
jail and emerged to find his career was in like Flynn's.
   Producer Walter Wanger, a Motion Picture Academy president and
pillar of the film community, suspected his wife, actress Joan
Bennett, was having an affair with her agent and shot the man.
Warning that vigilantism was not tolerated in Beverly Hills, the
judge gave the producer a light sentence.
   In 1958, Lana Turner's daughter, Cheryl Crane, plunged a butcher
knife into her mother's lover, Johnny Stompanato, during a violent
argument between the two adults. Giesler was the first person the
actress called.
   Miss Turner gave her most dramatic performance before the
coroner's jury. The verdict came in 20 minutes: justifiable
homicide.
   Changing times have brought suits by homosexuals against their
famous lovers: Scott Thorson vs. Liberace; Marc Christian vs. Rock
Hudson's estate. The word palimony was coined with Michele Triola's
suit against her live-in lover, Lee Marvin, in the late 1970s. Miss
Triola received a small settlement.
   Coming palimony attraction: Sondra Locke vs. Clint Eastwood.

   He wore a blue suit, a white shirt and a
brilliant red tie that seemed to shout, ``USA Today.''
   He also wore a diamond-studded USA Today ring, third finger left
hand, which his first wife said was ``much more appropriate than
the simple little gold wedding band I put on his finger on June 16,
1946.''
   But Al Neuharth, the man who helped build Gannett Co. into a
giant and who designed and led the first general interest national
newspaper to profit, deserves to gloat a little.
   Neuharth, 65 and recently retired, paused somewhere between
``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and ``Donahue'' to talk about his
autobiography, ``Confessions of an S.O.B.,'' and explain why he
admits ``to some of the dumb things I did.''
   ``I spent a lifetime putting a microscope on other people. I
would have felt sleazy if I'd just written a book bragging about
everything that worked,'' he said. ``A lot of people said why show
all the warts. And I said the Bible says the truth shall set you
free. And I feel a lot freer.''
   The book makes no secret of Neuharth's hard-nosed business
tactics, such as taking advantage of a competitor's conversation he
overheard.
   ``I believe in practicing the S.O.B.'s Golden Rule:
   Expect others to do unto you what you would do to them.
   The modern translation: Cover your ass.''
   He still works on a typewriter, an old-fashioned Royal used to
beatings a word processor could not endure. He carried it with him
from college to The Miami Herald and the Detroit Free Press. When
he moved to Gannett and the Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester,
N.Y., it broke down.
   ``They couldn't get the damn thing repaired. So we put out an
all-points bulletin for this model and we got five of them for the
average cost of $11 apiece. They found them in old furniture stores
in little towns. We cannibalize them for parts.''
   When someone suggested he ask his two children, a journalist and
a lawyer, to write their impressions of him as a father, he took it
a step further and suggested his two wives write their own chapters
of him as a husband.
   They did. His first wife of 26 years, Loretta Helgeland, was a
cheerleader, like Neuharth, in high school in South Dakota. She
remembers when they had only 12 cents in the bank.
   A year and a half after their divorce, he married Lori Wilson, a
former Florida state senator. It lasted eight years. Her chapter
begins, ``Al Neuharth is a snake.''
   On the Winfrey show, scheduled to be broadcast this week, Ms.
Winfrey asks her, ``Why did you call him a snake?'' According to
Neuharth she replied, ``Well, I didn't want to insult a chameleon
by calling him a chameleon.''
   No, he says, he will not marry again. ``I've had two good
marriages.''
   With 100,000 copies on order, his book has entered a second
printing.
   Outspoken to the point some consider outrageous, Neuharth
recently wrote a column urging airlines to get ``aging women'' and
``flighty young men'' off their cabin crews and bring back shapely,
young ``sky girls.'' One veteran female flight attendant called him
a ``Neanderthal.''
   He's reticent on politics, though. He keeps his own votes a
secret and insisted his papers not take sides.
   When USA Today came out for one side in the Philippine
elections, Neuharth blew his stack. ``How dumb can you be?
Especially for a national newspaper. I think it hurts your
credibility.''
   In Florida, where he makes his home, one can register as
Democrat, Republican, independent or ``none of the above.'' When
George Wallace ran as an independent, he switched to ``none of the
above.''
   Retirement, he says, came easily because he planned for it.
   He has switched from gin martinis to vodka. He still plays
tennis, jogs, looks fit, relaxed. He remains as chairman of the
Gannett Foundation, which takes a couple of days a week, and is on
a committee to raise $40 million to restore Mount Rushmore.
   But even in retirement, Neuharth has four-color daily legacy in
his thoughts.
   ``I think there may be room for another national newspaper, but
it would have to be quite different from USA Today. I mean, we were
there first and the franchise was a little fragile for a while. But
after seven years and with the base we've got and unless our people
screw it up, we're in pretty good shape.''

<TEXT>
   Deciding that people-to-people aid works
faster than relief from the government, the town of Cary has
``adopted'' a small South Carolina town devastated by Hurricane
Hugo.
   Cary officials say the 1,170 residents of Summerton, S.C.,
between Charleston and Columbia, can't wait for federal and state
aid to come through.
   Four fire stations in the North Carolina town of 45,000 will be
collection points for donated goods in ``Operation Help Our
Neighbors.'' A convoy of town vehicles and volunteers' cars will
make the 220-mile trip to deliver the supplies and help clean up
and repair the town.
   ``South Carolina is wiped out,'' said Jonathan B. Graham, a Cary
construction management official. ``A lot of people here are
sitting at home saying, `What can I do?''' The worst the area
around Cary, in eastern North Carolina not far from Raleigh, got
from Hugo is some heavy rain and wind.
   Stan Godwin, Cary's construction superintendent, visited
Summerton on Saturday to see what equipment volunteers should
bring. The convoy is tentatively scheduled for next weekend, but
supplies could be sent earlier if enough donations come in.
   Summerton's plight came to Cary's attention through Helen and
Bert Miner, a Cary couple whose daughter and son-in-law live in
Summerton. The Miners already have made two trips to the South
Carolina town in a pickup loaded with food and other supplies.
   ``The Red Cross was putting all its efforts into Charleston,''
Mrs. Miner said. ``A lot of things go to the big places, and they
forget about these little towns.''
   When the Miners made their first trip to Summerton, 36 hours
after the storm, 30 people were waiting to unload their truck.
   ``They kept saying, `Thank you, thank you,''' she said.
   Two days later, back in Cary, the Miners got a call from Barbara
Carlton, Summerton's assistant to the mayor, saying the town needed
more food and clothing.
   The Miners returned to Summerton with about $1,000 worth of
donated groceries.
   Summerton endured four hours of 110 mph to 130 mph winds before
and after the eye of Hurricane Hugo came through town, Mrs. Carlton
said in a telephone interview last week. After the storm, she said,
help seemed slow to arrive.
   ``It took about four days, because Charleston and Sumter were
hit. We were just sitting here in between.''
   Summerton still needs canned goods, diapers, baby food, paper
products, candles, batteries, flashlights, yard tools _ ``just the
basic necessities of life,'' Mrs. Carlton said.
   Summerton was ``a poor town to begin with,'' she said, and many
residents are elderly, on fixed incomes.
   The town council approved Cary's role in the relief effort
Thursday, including the expense of transporting the supplies.
   ``We think we should try to do something quickly,'' Mayor Koka
E. Booth said. ``We're concerned that a small municipality has been
devastated and cannot wait for all the red tape and bureaucracy you
usually have to go through. They can't get enough help. We should
be good neighbors.''

   A man who murdered his father so he could
inherit his paper tissue factory was hanged Saturday in the main
square of the northern city of Aleppo, the government newspaper
reported.
   Bakri Youssef Shawa was executed in public along with an
accomplice, Abdul-Hamid Kala, a professional killer to whom Youssef
paid $750 to assist in the slaying of Youssef Shawa, the paper
Tishrin said.
   The two men stabbed and shot their victim repeatedly,
dismembered the body and then burned it, the paper said.
   ``Syria has not witnessed such a savage crime before,'' the
paper said.
   About three or four hangings per year occur in Syrian, which
usually reserves the form of execution for people convicted of
espionage or particularly gruesome crimes.

<HEAD>Salinas Makes First Visit To U.S. With Hopes For `Mature' Relationship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari begins
his first official visit to Washington at a time when U.S.-Mexican
relations are stronger than they have been in years.
   Salinas said he hopes the closer ties will translate into
economic gains.
   ``Mexican nationalism no longer has to feed on anti-U.S.
feelings,'' said an official close to the president.
``Anti-Americanism is no longer a valid issue in the Mexican
political debate.''
   Salinas and his wife, Cecilia, were to travel to Camp David on
Sunday as guests of President and Barbara Bush before official
visits to Washington and New York. He will receive an honorary
degree from Brown University before returning to Mexico on Oct. 6.
   Bush and Salinas are perceived in Mexico to have a personal
friendship unmatched in the history of relationships between U.S.
and Mexican presidents.
   ``There is a relation of mutual respect that allows
cordiality,'' Salinas said Thursday night.
   ``Bush has a very important characteristic that appeals to
Salinas. He is not an ideologue,'' the official close to Salinas
said on condition of anonymity. ``Bush has gone out of his way to
show special consideration for Salinas.''
   Mexicans see the invitation to Camp David as a special honor; it
will be only the third time a Mexican president has been there.
   Ten months into his term, Salinas has become the symbol of a new
image for Mexico: a country regaining self-confidence after nearly
eight years of economic crisis, a country eager to resume economic
growth and assume an international role in commerce and foreign
affairs.
   The Salinas and Bush administrations worked closely in July to
renegotiate a large part of Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt, and
the deal was closed after U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
lobbied commercial bankers in his office.
   The Mexicans hope for a respite through debt and interest
reductions that will make more money available for Salinas'
development projets. He also hopes for improved trade agreements
with the United States and more foreign investment.
   Salinas, 41, has gained respect here and abroad by his dramatic
blows against corruption, including the jailing of previously
untouchable labor bosses, and by ordering the arrests of several
top drug traffickers.
   U.S. officials have said they are very pleased by Salinas' war
on drugs even though many agree with Mexican officials, who say the
real problem is U.S. demand.
   Mexico has seized more than 24 tons of cocaine this year,
Salinas said at a news conference Thursday. He said the amount was
significant but that ``a lot of drugs are getting through.''
   In foreign affairs, Salinas has departed from the anti-American
position of previous administrations, a policy that appeals to
Mexicans who still remember that the United States took over half
of their nation's territory following the Mexican War in 1845.
   The Mexican government ``no longer feels inhibited from agreeing
with the United States in some foreign policy matters,'' said a
Salinas aide.
   Salinas has taken drastic steps to improve the economy _
reducing government controls, selling government-owned companies,
opening new fields to domestic and international investors and
forcing inefficient Mexican manufacturers to compete with
lower-cost foreign producers.
   Now he hopes that his campaign on drugs and economic reforms
will help him gain U.S. trade concessions.
   ``We want trade reciprocity,'' Salinas said, referring to the
opening of Mexican markets to U.S. products from refrigerators to
compact discs.
   He expects to return from his visit with bilateral agreements on
products such as textiles and steel, although U.S. officials have
said they're not sure those agreements will be ready for signature.
   Salinas also will meet with investors and top industrial
managers during his trip. He has invited foreign and domestic
investors to participate in companies previously run by the
government, such as the telephone system.
   Salinas claimed his economic policies have encouraged the return
of more than $2.5 billion held by Mexicans abroad and said his
government has approved new foreign investment projects worth $2
billion since March.
   Mexico's economy is growing this year at a rate of 2.5 per cent
_ far better than the 1 percent projected _ and inflation is
expected to be no higher then 30 per cent, a drop from 51.7 percent
last year, Salinas said.
   The president is much stronger politically than he was when he
took office Dec. 1, according to opinion polls in the capital,
where Salinas' Institutional Revolutionary Party lost by a wide
margin.
   However, his election was marred by charges of widespread fraud
and he still faces domestic pressure to approve electoral reforms
that could break the grip his party has had on Mexican politics for
decades.

   Hundreds of black and mixed-race
people declared the end of apartheid on two whites-only beaches
Saturday by picnicking, swimming, singing and praying under the
watchful eye of the police.
   Protesters at the Strand, a conservative seaside town 20 miles
east of Cape Town, made ``sure they had staked their claim
properly. They walked around and wet their feet in God's water,''
said Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   Wearing a yellow sun-hat with the slogan ``Free the Beaches,''
and a T-shirt saying, ``Just Call me Arch,'' the 56-year-old Tutu
jogged on the beach. He then held a prayer service after persuading
police not to use force on the crowd, which ignored police orders
over loudspeakers to disperse.
   Organizers had refused to seek permission to hold the
demonstration.
   Some families left after the police removed foreign television
crews and local photographers. But most stayed, opening their
picnic lunches, swimming and wading in the water as the crowd grew
to 1,500.
   About 100 whites watched from the roadside, many criticizing the
protest as they talked among themselves.
   Police took no action. Many officers even began smiling and
waving as they left when the crowds thinned in the afternoon.
   ``I hope that the inhabitants of the Strand will realize that we
have liberated them,'' Tutu told a news conference later. ``They
don't have to watch whether black people are walking on their
beaches any longer. They will enjoy the liberation of being able to
share.''
   Another 1,000 people gathered in the eastern Cape province city
of Port Elizabeth, where former Mayor Graham Richards erected a
homemade sign declaring Pollock Beach, reserved for whites for 35
years, was open to all.
   The City Council has tried to end beach segregation, but the
provincial administrator, appointed by the governing National
Party, has refused.
   The wood sign resembled nearby municipal signs declaring the
beach is for the use of whites only. The new sign said, ``We the
people of Port Elizabeth hereby declare Pollock Beach open for the
use of all people.''
   Seven buses brought black people from townships 10 miles north
of Port Elizabeth. Many black youths chanted and danced around the
beach, some carried banners and placards. Whites paid them little
attention and mixed freely on the sand and in the water.
   ``This mass, non-racial picnic reminds us who we are, that we
are God's family. It is human selfishness and greed that makes
beaches for whites only,'' the Rev. David Vika of the
Interdenominational Ministers Association said at a prayer service
after the sign was posted in the sand.
   A magistrate gave permission for the Port Elizabeth
demonstration, which was rained out by midafternoon.
   No approval was sought for the protest at the Strand, but police
had been quoted in the Cape Town newspapers as saying they would
take no action as long as the demonstration was peaceful.
   There was no explanation for their change of mind, when they
drove vans onto the beach and ordered the crowd to leave within
three minutes.
   Tutu said he was afraid that when police took the journalists
away they planned to use force against the crowd.
   On Aug. 19, Tutu recalled, when thousands of blacks tried to get
to the Strand beach, police used whips and dogs to drive them away.
   The Rev. John Freeth, Anglican archdeacon of the Athlone
mixed-race township, said Saturday evening:
   ``The police deserve credit for withdrawing. There were no nasty
incidents. It was a peaceful picnic against racial discrimination.''
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.

   A tractor-trailer loaded with steel coils
rear-ended a disabled tourist bus on a roadway Saturday, injuring
18 people, police said.
   The bus, known as the Lolly Trolley and designed to resemble a
trolley, was used to carry visitors on sight-seeing tours. It had
stopped because of mechanical problems in one of the lanes of the
``innerbelt'' freeway carrying traffic from Interstate 71 to I-90,
said Sgt. Kenneth Kirchner.
   He said the truck was unable to stop and struck the vehicle
around 11 a.m., pinning the driver inside his truck.
   Police said the injured _ Kirchner gave the number at 18 _ were
being carried to various hospitals in the city. There was no
immediate report of fatalities or information on the severity of
the injuries.
   Part of southbound I-71 was closed as a result of the accident.

<HEAD>DEA Says No Evidence Drugs Played Part in Mystery Flight Last July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal drug enforcement officials say they
have no evidence that drug trafficking played a part in the mystery
flight, crash and gunshot wound of Thomas Root last July.
   But a Miami spokesman for the FBI, Paul Miller, said the bureau
is continuing to investigate the activities of the Alexandria, Va.,
communications lawyer in the days preceding his bizarre odyssey,
according to the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Sun-Sentinel.
   Con Dougherty, spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said in Washington on Saturday that the question of
drug involvement ``obviously was looked into'' and ``nothing was
found to draw the interest of headquarters.''
   Root's Cessna crashed into the Atlantic near the Bahamas July 13
when it ran out of fuel several hours after takeoff from Washington
National Airport. After his rescue, hospital authorities discovered
a gunshot wound in his abdomen. Root said he had blacked out
shortly after takeoff, but didn't suffer the gunshot wound until
his pistol was accidentally triggered by the impact of the crash.
   The DEA interviewed Root after his fateful flight when it
learned that Virginia authorities had earlier discovered, under
warrant, several weapons and a quantity of ether which the lawyer
kept in the Manassas, Va., hanger that housed his single-engine
plane. But all the guns were licensed, no drugs were found, and he
was not charged with any crime as a consequence of that April 24
search.
   ``Just to clear the air, we wanted to talk to Mr. Root regarding
the receipt of that (search) warrant,'' said Mario Perez of the
DEA's Washington field office. ``His explanations were forthcoming.
We found none of the essential elements to continue an
investigation.''
   Perez said Root told the DEA that, as a gun fancier, he kept his
collection at the airport so as not to tempt the small children in
his home and neighborhood. Root has said publicly that he used the
ether, a medical compound sometimes used in processing cocaine, to
clean oil and residues from his plane.
   Root's wife, Kathy, expressed relief that her husband had been
cleared by the DEA officials. ``We're certainly glad that what his
friends and family knew to be true all along has been determined to
be the case by the federal government,'' she said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has yet to report on
its separate investigation into the crash, though the legwork has
been completed. And the Sun-Sentinel quoted Miller as saying the
FBI's 11-week investigation of Root's activities before the flight
would continue.

   A group of Atlanta physicians organized supplies
for a three-day mercy mission to St. Croix for the victims of
Hurricane Hugo, but said today that red tape held up their flight
to the Caribbean.
   ``We heard there were no medicines, and people were going into
comas,'' said Dr. William Osborne, medical director of Southside
Health Care Center, which is sending the team. ``So we volunteered
to go.''
   He said military officials in Washington and Puerto Rico were
trying to track down what happened to the military plane Osborne
thought he had arranged to carry the eight doctors, two nurses, a
respiratory therapist, a pharmacist and a social worker to St.
Croix.
   ``We're just trying to do something that's right and we're being
held up by all this red tape,'' he said. ``There's a possibility we
may not go if we can't get the plane this weekend. Some people have
other commitments.''
   Earlier today, Osborne said he thought bad weather in Atlanta
was delaying the military jet's arrival.
   He said if the medical team can't leave this weekend, he may
spend the week gathering more supplies and go next weekend to St.
Croix, where Hugo's fury killed four people and left most of the
island's 55,000 residents homeless, hungry and desperate.
   Osborne said Friday that the group had been planning the trip
since Monday. They expect to spend three days treating patients and
assessing the island's medical needs.
   ``If we do deem there is more need, we can come back and rally
the entire black community to assist in the efforts, with the
intention of returning at a later date,'' Osborne said. ``That is
our hope.''
   Kim Butler, a social worker at an Atlanta hospital and a native
of St. Croix, worked out details with civil defense officials in
Miami, who put her in touch with officials in St. Croix.
   The Southside staff spent Monday and Tuesday bundling up several
boxes of antibiotics, antiseptics, insulin, syringes, bandages and
gloves, and shipped the package off to St. Croix Wednesday.
   The team will take more supplies with them, including tetanus
immunizations and medication for heart and blood pressure
conditions, Osborne said.
   The group chose to go to St. Croix because members saw a greater
need there than in South Carolina, which also was raked by Hugo's
desructive winds.
   ``We felt enough people were helping in Charleston,'' Osborne
said. ``This island was totally devastated.''

   Below the Tillamook County landfill, an
algaelike mush lines a stream that slowly empties into what was
once Olof Hallstrom's dairy pasture.
   Hallstrom suspects the water is the source of health problems
that dogged his cows and eventually affected him, his wife and four
of their five children.
   Hallstrom's quest to right was he considers an injustice has
taken him to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear arguments
Wednesday in his lawsuit to force Tillamook County to clean up the
landfill.
   For the soft-spoken 59-year-old farmer and inventor, the
decision by the high court to hear the case is another step in a
persistent fight that began years ago with his father.
   ``He knows what's right and he's stubborn about it ... but he's
stubborn in a very gentle way. He smiles and doesn't move,'' said
Hallstrom's attorney, Kim Buckley.
   The case turns on a narrow point of law involving notice
requirements, but environmentalists who support Hallstrom's
arguments say it could have a broad impact on citizens' ability to
seek enforcement of the nation's environmental laws.
   Hallstrom and his wife, Mary, live on a hill overlooking the
Tillamook River on the rainy Oregon Coast. Spread out below is
what's left of the 200-acre dairy farm that Hallstrom's father,
Olof Sr., established in the late 1920s.
   And above the pasture on the hill opposite the Hallstroms' home
is the site where in 1980, the county developed a landfill on
ground residents had used for years as a dump.
   Hallstrom contends dead animals, transformers full of toxic oil,
herbicides, lead paint and other materials were left at the dump,
which was used for open burning in the 1940s.
   It wasn't until he read a 1973 issue of a dairy trade magazine
that Hallstrom suspected the landfill was causing his problems.
   ``I had lost quite a few cows and really not knowing what the
cause was,'' Hallstrom said.
   He began testing runoff and found toxic materials on his land,
including arsenic, selenium, boron, copper, cyanide, manganese,
zinc and phenols at levels exceeding state and federal standards.
   Doctors said exposure to such substances could be the reason he,
his wife and his grown children must take medicine every day for
thyroid conditions, and one daughter must take medicine for her
adrenal gland.
   Buckley said disease-causing bacteria _ salmonella, cholera and
others _ also have been found in water running into the Hallstroms'
pasture.
   Hallstrom said he gave up use of the pasture for dairy cattle,
and there never was any investigation of whether milk from his herd
was contaminated. Hallstrom now keeps a few beef cattle on his land
and owns a small manufacturing business.
   The county began drawing warnings from the state Department of
Environmental Quality about contaminated water flowing outside the
landfill soon after it opened. It was closed in January, because of
increasingly strict environmental regulations, said Jon Oshel, the
county's public works director since 1982.
   Oshel says nobody knows what was dumped at the site before it
became a county landfill, but that it's impossible to dispute
Hallstrom's contentions.
   ``Anyone who wanted to haul anything hauled it up there,'' Oshel
said.
   Hallstrom and his wife sued in 1982 under provisions of the
federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, one of at least 13
laws that give citizens the right to seek environmental enforcement.
   Included in the laws are provisions for giving enforcement
agencies 60 days' notice of the intent to file a lawsuit.
   Tillamook County challenged the lawsuit on the ground that the
Hallstroms failed to fulfill the law's requirement that they notify
the Department of Environmental Quality and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency. But a U.S. District Court judge in
Portland found the notice requirement was flexible and could be
modified.
   The lawsuit proceeded to trial and the Hallstroms won an order
that the landfill be cleaned up. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco reversed the ruling, citing the failure to
notify.
   The Hallstroms appealed to the Supreme Court, which apparently
agreed that differing interpretations of the notice requirement by
federal appeals courts around the country ought to be resolved.
   Also at stake is about $95,000 in legal and expert witness fees
the Hallstroms have amassed.
   The Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife Inc., the National
Audubon Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the
Wilderness Society have filed arguments supporting the Hallstroms.
The groups argue that rigid interpretation would impede citizens
seeking enforcement of federal environmental law.

   Faye Thompson went to a federal aid
center Saturday for a loan to rebuild her auto repair shop and
patch the roof of her house torn open by Hurricane Hugo. What she
got was an application and instructions to come back Oct. 12 to
fill out forms.
   ``My house won't be standing by Oct. 12,'' said Mrs. Thompson,
42, as a steady drizzle fell. ``I need help right now. There's too
much red tape. What good is this piece of paper going to do for my
roof?''
   Nine days after Hurricane Hugo passed, a political storm still
rages over how quickly the federal government responded to a crisis
in South Carolina, where damage has been estimated at $3 billion or
more.
   The anger has focused on the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which reports directly to the president and has a budget of
$600 million a year.
   A chief critic has been Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., who has
accused the agency of strangling aid attempts in red tape and has
called FEMA's hierarchy a ``bunch of bureaucratic jackasses'' who
would do best to ``get the hell out of the way.''
   President Bush, who flew to South Carolina on Friday for a brief
look at the damage, defended the administration's response to the
disaster, saying he was ``satisfied the federal government has
moved, and moved expeditiously.''
   Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., a Democrat, accuses the
agency of being slow to respond.
   ``The system is not designed to cope immediately and urgently
with a major disaster,'' he said. ``They didn't bring in enough
people, enough resources.''
   As one example, he said FEMA officials asked for a written
assessment of the need for portable generators, even though
everybody knew of widespread power outages.
   FEMA already was in the Caribbean attempting to assist victims
of Hugo as the storm roared toward the mainland, spreading the
agency a bit thin.
   Hugo killed 33 people in the Caribbean; 28 deaths on the U.S.
mainland are blamed on the hurricane and its remnants.
   In South Carolina, some 50,000 people were displaced by the
storm, 270,000 lost jobs, and at least 135,000 still had no
electricity Saturday.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell warned that the state must build 65 miles
of protective sand dunes to prevent further damage to the
coastline. The tide is expected to rise to 2 feet higher than usual
in mid-October, a once-in-a-decade high because the moon will be
unusually close to the earth. The tide could further erode beaches.
   The governor said he discussed the ``mind-boggling'' dune
project with Bush. Federal funds would cover three-fourths of the
$65 million needed for the project.
   Campbell requested federal disaster aid the day after Hugo
struck the state Sept. 21. A FEMA representative in Charleston took
an aerial survey of the coast and Bush signed the disaster
declaration before noon the same day.
   But the first FEMA office didn't open until Thursday, a week
after Hugo battered the region. One of the first five FEMA centers
is located in a former toy store and was opened before electrical
power was restored. Five more open this weekend.
   FEMA spokesman Bill McAda said the agency waits at least four
days before it opens aid offices to give victims time to contact
their insurance agents.
   The centers help people get grants for repairs to homes or
businesses and aid for those who lost jobs to the storm. Assistance
also can be given on tax questions, insurance claims and price
gouging.
   Under one program, FEMA reimburses individuals and families who
qualify for temporary housing for up to two years. Those who don't
qualify under that program can apply for up to $10,000 in grants.
   Those who need immediate help with food, clothing and shelter
are directed to the American Red Cross.
   Residents looking for help are disheartened to find that jobless
pay may take two to three weeks to process, and they may not
actually receive their loans for two months.
   ``We're doing the best we can,'' said FEMA manager Shirley
Caraway. ``I feel for the people, but this process is necessary.
It's something they have to go through. It's their tax dollars.''
   Local officials gave the federal agency mixed reviews.
   Richard Wern, mayor of St. George in the hard-hit rural county
northwest of Charleston, said he had no contact with FEMA and no
nearby aid center, though hundreds of people were waiting in line
in his town for food and water.
   ``They need money to repair their water systems and their
wells,'' he said. ``That would help them become more
self-sufficient more quickly.''
   But in coastal Georgetown, city administrator Mitch Sizemore
said FEMA's help in paying for repairs to the municipal power
system ``is going to be tremendous.''
   Sizemore said some of the disappointment in FEMA may be based on
unrealistic expectations among elected officials unfamiliar with
the agency's mission, calling it a ``reimbursement agency'' that
moves in after the initial response by local governments.
   Riley said the federal government should cross-train employees
in all departments to handle emergencies so thousands of workers
could be shipped to disaster areas to process requests. FEMA has
350 people in South Carolina handling claims.
   Gregg Chappell, whose department oversees FEMA's disaster
assistance program, admitted the scope of Hugo's destruction
overwhelmed the agency.
   ``We need to deal with this type of disaster, this huge
disaster, differently than we do the normal disaster,'' he told
CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday.''
   But the concession meant little to Ron Gibson, who has been
living out of one suitcase since his house and clothing shop on
Sullivan's Island was badly damaged in the storm.
   ``I haven't been able to work. I sit in the dark in frustration
and stand in these long lines,'' Gibson said. ``There has to be a
better setup. If it means expediting things quickly and settling up
later, do it.''

<UNK>Lava Pours From Europe's Most Active Volcano</UNK>
<DATELINE>CATANIA, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fountains of lava spewed Saturday from a
new crater on Mount Etna and sent a red-hot river of magma flowing
down the eastern slope of Europe's most active volanco.
   Scientists said the magma gushed from a 500-foot crater that
opened 8,500 feet up the mountain after a series of tremors on
Thursday.
   News reports said the river of lava was 15 yards wide and had
snaked down to the 4,500-foot level, still oozing forward at about
10 yards an hour.
   Mount Etna began its latest eruption on Sept. 11. Volcano
experts say there is no danger to any of the hamlets near the
mountain, which are protected by a series of peaks and valleys that
would channel the lava away from them.

<HEAD>Ecuador Captures Important Colombian Drug Trafficker ^With AM-Colombia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Colombian cocaine trafficker wanted
in the United States has been arrested in Ecuador and may be
extradited to Colombia within a few days, a senior government
official said Saturday.
   Evaristo Porras Ardila, regarded as a leader of the Medellin
drug cartel, was detained Thursday in Tulcan, a town on the
Colombian border, and turned over to Ecuador's drug police force,
the official said.
   ``We are going to extradite him to Colombia after the
investigation is completed,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   A spokesman for the Colombian Embassy said the United States
wants to extradite Porras Ardila and try him on unspecified drug
trafficking charges.
   But Porras Ardila's name is not on a list the U.S. Justice
Department compiled of the top 12 most Colombian traffickers being
sought by U.S. courts, and no information was immediately available
on charges pending against him.
   Another Colombian official, who also demanded anonymity,
described Porras Ardila as one of Colombia's ``eight most
important'' narcotics traffickers. He is said to have his base in
Leticia in Colombia's Amazon jungle region.
   Porras Ardila has been linked with the assassination of
Guillermo Cano, director of the Colombian newspaper El Espectador,
sources said. He has been arrested twice in Colombia but was
released by judges both times.
   Tulcan, the Ecuadorean town where Porras Ardila was arrested
Thursday, is 90 miles northeast of Quito.
   Earlier this month, Ecuador extradited to Colombia two drug
traffickers who entered the country illegally in a small plane with
$300,000 in cash.
   For the last two years Colombian drug cartels have increased
their presence in Ecuador, a small nation of 10 million people,
making it an important trans-shipment point for cocaine smuggled to
the United States and Europe.
   President Virgilio Barco of Colombia ordered a crackdown on the
drug cartels in his country after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading
presidential candidate and outspoken foe of drug trafficking, was
assassinated Aug. 18.
   The traffickers responded by declaring war on the government,
and they said in a communique earlier this month that they would
prefer a grave in Colombia to a jail cell in the United States. The
top traffickers sought by the United States are believed to have
fled Colombia to evade arrest.

   A woman charged with sending more than 5,000
threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox was ordered to stand
trial Oct. 12 on five felony counts of making terrorist threats.
   Tina Marie Ledbetter, 27, of Camarillo pleaded innocent Friday
to the charges. If convicted, she faces up to four years in state
prison.
   Her letters to Fox, star of the television series ``Family
Ties'' and the motion pictures ``Back to the Future'' and
``Casualties of War,'' began arriving at Paramount Studios in
February 1988, prosecutors said.
   The actor received nearly all of the letters over the course of
a year, with 800 arriving in July 1988, the month he married
actress Tracy Pollan.
   Usually signed, ``Your No. 1 Fan,'' the tone of the letters
became increasingly angry as Fox broke up with actress Nancy McKeon
and became engaged to Miss Pollan.
   ``You are a total (expletive) for marrying Tracy,'' one letter
said.
   Fox called the letters ``very frightening,'' at a preliminary
hearing, and said he feared for the safety of himself, his wife and
their baby.
   Ms. Ledbetter is being held without bail in the psychiatric unit
of the Sybil Brand Institute for Women.

picketing by musicians engaged in a contract dispute since summer.
   Leaders of Musicians Local 369 said Newton would be ``piercing

to the resort.
   Meanwhile, Bally's Hotel and Casino said Conway Twitty and
George Jones would play at that resort Oct. 3-8.
   Newton, who gave up $500,000 in performance fees while observing
the line the first two weeks of his current three-week engagement,
performed two shows Friday night and was scheduled to play through
the weekend.
   Musicians have been without a contract since June 1 in a dispute
over taped music in production shows _ shows with stable ensemble
casts rather than visiting stars _ and guaranteed work for
musicians playing for headliners.

   Former ambassador and publisher Walter H.
Annenberg has donated $25 million to art museums in Philadelphia,
New York and Washington.
   ``Whatever I do philanthropically, I regard as a citizenship
responsibility,'' Annenberg said. ``Support in behalf of others
should be in keeping with your own good fortune, and if you don't
understand that, you're really not much of a citizen.''
   Annenberg donated $15 million to New York's Metropolitan Museum
of Art and $5 million each to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and
the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
   Philadelphia museum director Anne d'Harnoncourt, whom Annenberg
called Thursday to announce his plans, described the gift as ``a
fabulous bolt from the blue.''
   ``This is something we not only weren't expecting, we weren't
even asking for,'' said museum president Robert Montgomery Scott,
who said he was ``absolutely bowled over'' by the donation.
   The Annenberg gifts to all three museums are earmarked for
acquisitions. The donation to the Philadelphia museum is in
addition to a $5 million gift in June to the museum's five-year
capital campaign by Annenberg, former ambassador to Great Britain.
   J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery, said
Annenberg's gift was ``a tremendous shot in the arm, because
acquisitions are increasingly elusive these days, given the prices
in the art world.''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `The Elks voted...', to CORRECT location of

<TEXT>
   When the national Elks lodge changed its
voting rules over the summer, people such as Thomas J. Montgomery
were supposed to find it easier to become members.
   But Montgomery, a retired state worker and decorated World War
II veteran, was rejected last month by the Elks lodge in the Los
Angeles suburb of Van Nuys in a vote many people blamed on racism.
   ``I feel like a small boy that stubbed his toe,'' said
Montgomery, 69, of Pacoima. ``It hurts too bad to laugh and I'm too
old to cry.''
   Two months after the Elks lodge abandoned what many considered a
discriminatory voting system, black applicants still find it
difficult to become members of the 121-year-old Benevolent and
Protective Order of Elks.
   Montgomery was one of three black applicants denied membership
in two California lodges in September, reigniting a controversy
over the Elks' membership practices. A lodge in Salinas rejected a
black police officer's application, prompting at least 20 Elks to
resign.
   Officials with the virtually all-white, 1.6 million-member
organization maintain that the Elks are not racist and that
applicants were turned down for other reasons.
   National Elks spokesman Robert Yothers called the rejections
``isolated incidents'' that have been ``blown out of proportion.''
He wouldn't say how many blacks are in the organization's 2,300
lodges, or whether other blacks in other states had been accepted
or turned down since the rule change.
   Earlier this year, a lodge in Lompoc, 140 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, rejected two black applicants. With community anger and a
state attorney general's investigation hanging over their heads,
lodge officials decided to join civil rights activists in
pressuring the national lodge to change the voting rules.
   Under the old rules, a prospective member could be rejected, or
``blackballed,'' by only three ``no'' votes, regardless of how many
members vote for approval. Critics said this system gave too much
power to a racist minority.
   The Elks voted at their national convention in New Orleans in
July to abolish the blackball system in favor of a two-thirds
majority. The lodge kept its secret ballots and its all-male status.
   The Lompoc lodge, on a second vote Sept. 12, accepted the two
black applicants who had been rejected. But on the same night, the
Van Nuys lodge turned down Montgomery and another black applicant,
Jules S. Bagneris. The lodge also rejected a white applicant, Jack
Sheffield.
   All three, sponsored by lodge member and state Sen. Alan
Robbins, were again rejected on a second vote Sept. 19, prompting
angry responses from local politicians and the threat of a city
investigation.
   State Rep. Howard L. Berman called on the Internal Revenue
Service to revoke the tax-exempt status of the Van Nuys lodge. He
said the public should not be forced to subsidize racial
discrimination.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley urged Robbins to resign from the
lodge. Robbins said he is staying at the behest of the men he
sponsored, who want to reapply after the mandatory six-month
waiting period.
   ``I recognize that in the process of trying to achieve any gain,
there's going to be some pain and struggle involved,'' said
Bagneris, 29, a minister and unsuccessful City Council candidate.
``I'm willing to go walk the road now so that in five years from
now it will be an easier road for someone else.''
   In Salinas, however, many Elks members decided not to stay and
fight after the lodge on Sept. 13 rejected policeman Brandon Hill.
   Among those turning in their membership were the lodge's exalted
ruler, Scott Erdbacher, along with the city's mayor, a municipal
court judge, a school superintendent and several of Hill's fellow
officers.
   ``They didn't want a black person in the lodge. That was all
there was to it,'' said Erdbacher, a lawyer. ``I am outraged by
this.''
   While Elks officials deny that racism was at work, Yothers said
that the group would look into the rejections in Van Nuys and
Salinas.
   ``If it is determined or can be determined that people were
rejected because of race and if we can identify who cast the
ballots against them, action will be taken,'' he said. ``But
rejecting somebody on the basis of race is clearly against
everything the Elks stand for.''

   The PEN international writers association plans
to increase its East-West contacts to take advantage of easing
political tensions brought about mainly by the Soviet Union's
political reforms.
   ``We have the feeling that we have now a historical moment,''
Alexander Blokh, PEN's international secretary, said at the
conclusion Friday of the organization's 54th World Congress.
   He said writers from Western and Eastern European nations ``now
can meet across what was yesterday the `Iron Curtain' in full
confidence, in full friendship.''
   The next PEN World Congress will be held in November 1991 in
Vienna, Austria. Before that the association plans to arrange
regular meetings in Vienna so that writers from the East and West
can exchange information they might have missed during the past 40
years of limited contacts.
   ``There might be new misunderstandings. We have lived very
different lives,'' Blokh said. ``We think we should use this
magnificent opportunity to get to understand each other in depth.''
   A Soviet Russian chapter based in Moscow was admitted to PEN in
May, ending a 65-year division with Moscow, and it sent delegates
to the Canadian congress.
   A second Soviet chapter, for Ukrainian writers and based in
Kiev, was accepted during last week's congress. Separate Czech and
Slovak chapters also were recognized.
   PEN, the International Association of Poets, Playwrights,
Editors, Essayists and Novelists, was founded in London in 1921 and
now has some 11,000 members in 95 chapters.
   But while optimism was expressed about Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, there also were words
of caution.
   Czechoslovak playwright Vaclav Havel, denied a passport by his
government to attend the congress, sent a message asking PEN to
care for ``the frail foundations of our reawakened Czech and Slovak
centers.''
   Havel also asked the association's members to ``hope with us
that the Czechoslovak authorities, who have so far approved, will
not change their mind'' about the PEN chapters.
   The association's Writers in Prison Committee reported that the
number of cases on its list has reached a five-year high.
   ``It is a tendency that is very dangerous and unhappy,'' Swedish
publisher Thomas von Vegesack, the committee chairman, said Friday.
   He said that in May 1987, just before the glasnost campaign
started, the continent with the most cases of jailed writers was
Europe but most new cases now are in the Far East.
   Von Vegesack said 78 releases and 127 new arrests have been
reported since March, bringing the number of cases to 358.
   He also said the committee's most recent information from China
was 33 new cases of writers imprisoned since the pro-democracy
demonstrations in June.
   Blokh called the absence of delegates from the three Chinese PEN
chapters ``the great sadness'' of the convention.
   A resolution called on the Chinese government ``to cease the
persecution of writers, intellectuals and others, to prohibit the
use of torture and ensure that current detainees are treated
humanely, to guarantee the internationally recognied right to
freedom of expression for all citizens, and to release immediately
and unconditionally those who have been imprisoned for exercising
that right.''
   The Canadian English-speaking PEN chapter hosted the congress in
Toronto until Wednesday when delegates moved to Montreal where the
French-speaking chapter served as host.

<HEAD>Apple Industry Bailout Defended Despite Record Gross</HEAD>

   Washington apple growers grossed an
estimated record $493.6 million in the past year despite the scare
over the chemical Alar, calling into question the $9.5 million
federal bailout of the industry.
   But industry leaders said the gross sales do not tell the full
story because wholesale prices to farmers often lagged below the
cost of production.
   Still, news of the record sales _ counting the $9.5 of the
bailout itself _ was a surprise to staff members of the Washington
congressional delegation who sought the bailout.
   The previous record was $488 million in 1986.
   ``That's the first we've heard they had a banner year,'' said
Gretchen White, a staff member for U.S. Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash.,
who represents the nation's largest apple-growing region in central
Washington.
   U.S. Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who also pursued the bailout,
plans to study the sales figures, said Doug Levy, deputy press
secretary.
   ``He feels very strongly that the right thing was done,'' Levy
said. ``There was no question a crisis followed the Alar scare.''
   Levy pointed out that the $9.5 million came from existing
federal funds kept in reserve to stabilize troubled agriculture
industries. The money comes from duties on foreign imports.
   The $493.6 million estimate was based primarily on marketing
figures reported in July, before the bailout payment was made, said
Mary Beth Lang, spokeswoman for the Washington Department of
Agriculture. However, it includes estimates of apples sales for the
final portion of the crop year ending in September, including those
apples sold through the buyout.
   Washington producers received about $9.1 million of the buyout,
with the rest going to growers in Michigan, New York and elsewhere
in the country, Ms. Lang said.
   She noted the department's January forecast had estimated a crop
worth $588 million, and said the Alar scare contributed to the
lower figure six months later.
   Washington produced the second-largest apple crop in its history
last year, about 65 million 42-pound boxes, and wholesale prices
were below the cost of production during much of the second half of
the year.
   ``We have been expanding production and have expanded cost
factors,'' said Chris Schlect, head of the Northwest Horticultural
Council, an organization of Washington and Oregon tree fruit
growers that lobbies Congress.
   He said that makes it inaccurate to look at raw sales figures
and make year-by-year comparisons.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture in August authorized the $9.5
million emergency purchase of apples stockpiled in warehouses in
six states. Under the program, warehouses diverted the fruit to the
poor or to charitable organizations and were paid.
   At the time, warehouses were bulging with record inventories of
fruit after summer sales slumped in the wake of the Alar scare.
   That controversy began in late February when a private consumer
group said eating apples treated with the growth regulator
increased cancer risk in children.
   The apple industry and federal Environmental Protection Agency
and the Food and Drug Administration disputed the report as an
exaggeration of the risk, but sales dropped. The EPA has proposed
new standards for use of the chemical.
   Industry officials argued they would not be able to sell the
stockpiled apples through normal channels in time to clear
warehouses for the 1989 crop, which is being harvested now.
   Schlect defended the program, saying it stablized the industry
and set up the prospect of a better 1989-1990 crop season.
   In terms of gross sales, apple growers made 42 percent more from
the 1988 crop than from the weather-plagued 1987 crop, which was
still the largest in history. The 1989 crop currently being
harvested is estimated to be the largest fresh-market crop in state
history at 75 million boxes. Washington will grow an estimated 60
percent of the nation's apples this year.

   More than 50 years ago, Edith Spargo picked
Leatrice Roy's name on a pen pal list secretly hoping Leatrice was
a boy's name.
   Even though Spargo was wrong, the friendship endured and the two
kept writing. They say they have no idea how many letters they
traded _ neither saved the letters, saying they didn't tell of
extraordinary events.
   For the first time in 45 years, they talked to each other in
person last week at Roy's home in a reunion that fanned memories
and brought tears.
   The correspondence began through a school program in October
1938. In her sixth-grade class in Belmont, N.C., Edith, then 12,
picked Leatrice's name from a list in a school newspaper.
   In her first letter, Spargo said, her first question was a
gender inquiry.
   If she was disappointed that Leatrice was a girl, the feeling
didn't last. Almost 51 years later, she still writes at least once
a month.
   ``It's just natural because we've done it so long,'' said
Spargo, 63, of Asheboro, N.C.
   Roy, 65, said she doesn't remember how her name got on the pen
pal list in North Carolina. When the two began writing, she was 14
and a pupil at Spring Street Junior High School.
   When the Spargos arrived last week, it was the first time the
women had seen each other since the July 4 weekend of 1944. At that
time, Spargo, then 18 and living in New Jersey with her husband,
came up to New Hampshire. Roy was 20 and not yet married.
   ``We cried,'' Roy said, her eyes filling again. ``I couldn't
believe it was happening. I couldn't believe finally we were
getting together.''

   Chilly Chuggers, Jumbo Burps and Double Gulps
are the contenders in a soda battle that convenience stores are
hoping consumers won't find hard to swallow.
   The Starvin' Marvin chain sells the 32-ounce Chilly Chugger and
at High's stores, customers are offered the 46-ounce Jumbo Burp.
Seven-Eleven, however, is the leader with the mammoth 64-ounce
Double Gulp.
   Even fast-food giant McDonald's has recognized the move toward
gluttony and introduced its Super-Size 32-ounce soft drinks.
   ``Convenience stores have been trying to widen their customer
base and the easiest way to do that is to get more out of the
customers you have,'' said Donna Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the
National Association of Convenience Stores in Alexandria, Va.
   While fountain drinks account for only 2.8 percent of sales at
convenience stores, they carry a 64 percent gross profit margin.
   Seven-Eleven introduced its 64-ounce serve-yourself Double Gulp
nationwide this summer. Even 7-Eleven officials aren't sure why
anyone would want to drink a half-gallon of soda, which is the
equivalent of more than five 12-ounce cans.
   ``It's an odd product,'' said Steve Barnickel, owner of a
Baltimore 7-Eleven franchise. ``It's just something we have in case
someone wants to buy it. ... I think it's too much soda.''

<HEAD>Body of 19th Century General Returned to Homeland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of Gen. Juan Manuel de
Rosas, whose 19th century rule left political anomosities that are
still present, was returned from France Saturday in a move to heal
today's divisions.
   The casket, wrapped in the blue and white Argentine flag and
with a red poncho and a cavalry saber on top, arrived aboard an air
force plane from Paris and was flown by helicopter to Rosario, 188
miles north of Buenos Aires.
   ``We cannot construct a true fatherland atop hatred between
brothers,'' President Carlos Menem said in a televised speech at a
Rosario monument marking the spot the Argentine flag first flew in
1812.
   Rosas, who exercised iron rule over a confederation of newly
independent and rebellious provinces from 1835 until his ouster and
exile in 1852, is considered a hero by nationalists and a tyrant by
liberals.
   ``In welcoming Rosas we are saying goodbye to an old, wornout,
anachronistic and absurd country, a country of failure, hatred and
false illusions,'' said Menem, who took office on July 8.
   Standing beside the president were some of Rosas' descendants,
government officials, Roman Catholic church leaders and military
officers.
   Menem said he was ``willing to pay all the political costs ...
so that we can join hands, open our hearts and put resentments
behind us.''
   Argentines are bitterly divided over Menem's announced plan to
pardon military officers accused of human rights abuses during the
campaign against leftists by military juntas that ruled Argenina
from 1976 to 1983.
   At least 8,900 people disappeared during the violent suppression
and it is believed virtually all of them were killed.
   Menem denied published reports that he would use the ceremonies
honoring Rosas to declare the pardons.
   ``That's not among my plans,'' he told a Buenos Aires radio
station. ``I already said (the pardons would be ordered) before the
end of the year, perhaps before the end of the month. I'm talking
about October, not September.''
   The pardons are fiercely opposed by human rights groups, who
accuse the former military rulers of genocide. Those groups, some
leftist political parties and a faction of Menem's Peronist Party,
launched a campaign Friday to obtain a million signatures opposing
any presidential pardon.
   Menem is expected to announce pardons for some or all of the 18
generals and admirals facing trial on charges of human rights
violations.
   Rosas, a wealthy landowner, headed the Federalist Party in 1828
when the United Provinces of the River Plate were trying to
organize into the country that would become Argentina.
   He was governor of Buenos Aires province from 1829 to 1831 and
was asked by the legislature to return in 1835. He ruled with
dictatorial powers until his removal in 1852.
   Defeated by Gen. Justo Jose Urquiza, Rosas sought refuge aboard
an English frigate and fled into exile. He died in 1877 at
Southampton, England, where he was buried. The body was exhumed
Sept. 21 for transfer to Paris and then Buenos Aires.

   Two days of racially charged hearings on police
brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the
nation's third-largest city show the new mayor must still heal some
old wounds.
   Richard M. Daley was elected mayor April 4 amid fears by black
activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late
father, Richard J. Daley, who was mayor for more than 20 years
before his death in 1976.
   The younger Daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his
spring campaign, and after defeating black challengers in the
primary and general election, he named minorities to 11 of his 21
Cabinet positions.
   But now Daley finds himself on the defensive. Some black
politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not
doing enough to stop it.
   The racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special
hearings called by a City Council committee to look into
allegations of police brutality against blacks.
   ``There's been no demonstrable change on the part of white
leadership in this city to end racism,'' said Bob Starks, associate
professor of inner city studies at Northeastern Illinois
University. ``It's the same stuff, and it's seemingly getting
worse.''
   But Daley maintains that what's getting worse is ``irresponsible
political rhetoric'' from black politicians who are looking ahead
to the 1991 mayoral election. Daley is filling the remaining two
years of the term of the late Harold Washington, the city's first
black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he
died in November 1987.
   Daley has denounced the alleged police brutality.
   ``I will not ever tolerate police brutality, bias or bigotry in
the city of Chicago,'' Daley said. ``Everyone should join together
... to help alleviate this problem.''
   Also last week, a human relations task force made up of business
and civic leaders released a report saying racism in Chicago was
fueled by ``a shocking lack of contact'' between the city's ethnic
groups.
   The report, based on a 15-month investigation of the city's race
relations, concluded that racial divisions ``threaten to make
Chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are
antithetical to the city's economic growth and prosperity.''
   At the City Council hearings Thursday and Friday, blacks who
alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers
_ most of them white _ of unprovoked beatings, false arrests,
intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs.
   Among them was a 55-year-old grandmother, Callie Bryant, who
testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven
white police officers who gave her ``the sign of the Ku Klux Klan.''
   Two teen-age boys testified that in August they were picked up
by white officers, roughed up, and then dropped off in a white
neighborhood where they were attacked by white youths.
   The poice department's record was defended by Police
Superintendent LeRoy Martin, a black appointee of Washington.
   ``I'm the head of this police department, and if this police
department is bad, it's because I'm bad as superintendent,'' Martin
said. ``When this police department is attacked, I must defend it.
When it's wrong, I must correct it.''

<HEAD>Desert Closure to Protect Tortoise Starts Sunday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An emergency quarantine aimed at protecting
the endangered desert tortoise goes into effect Sunday, closing 59
square miles of the Mojave Desert to off-road enthusiasts, hikers
and grazing sheep.
   ``We're losing about 50 percent of the adult tortoises a year
out there right now,'' said Lee Delaney, head of the federal Bureau
of Land Management's area office in Ridgecrest. ``If that
continues, it would be a few short years before we don't have a
tortoise population.''
   BLM workers and volunteers were out Saturday ringing the area
with signs to notify the public of the one-year quarantine, Delaney
said Friday.
   A number of factors are preying on the tortoise, which was
designated an endangered species in August by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. The quarantine will help researchers determine
how and if the problems can be alleviated, Delaney said.
   A respiratory disease is blamed for half of the tortoise deaths,
and more than half of the remaining adult population is showing
signs of the illness, Delaney said. It is hoped the closure will
prevent the disease from spreading.
   The endangered species designation for the tortoise affects
desert areas in Nevada and Utah as well as California.
   In Nevada, where the tortoise is the official state reptile, the
designation is wreaking havoc on the construction boom in Las Vegas.
   The city and several other parties have sued in federal court in
Washington, D.C., claiming restrictions on building should be
confined only to areas where the respiratory disease is a problem.
   Delaney said stress caused by noisy and intrusive all-terrain
vehicles also is believed to be taking a toll on the animals, and
vandals have been shooting them in large numbers.
   The tortoises also are suffering from poor nutrition because of
drought conditions that have reduced vegetation and made drinking
water scarce.
   Predatory ravens also have been picking off newborn tortoises,
Delaney said.
   ``You just wonder if the poor old tortoise isn't on his way out
and there isn't anything we can do about it,'' he mused.
   But he and Jim St. Amant, senior co-chairman of the nonprofit
Desert Tortoise Council, say the preservation effort is worthwhile.
   ``Once they're gone, we don't get a second chance,'' said St.
Amant, also a biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game.
   He noted that the tortoise's welfare is considered an indication
of the quality of the desert habitat, and losses of the reptile
could indicate other species are at risk.
   The tortoise population has dropped sharply since the 1970s,
when the density was estimated at about 250 breeding tortoises per
square mile.
   ``In some areas we're down to about 70 per square mile,''
Delaney said.
   The quarantine area is north of Mojave, a desert city 70 miles
north of Los Angeles. Bordered on the northwest by Koehn Lake, the
area includes a 28-square-mile desert tortoise preserve.
   People caught in the area will be cited for trespassing,
officials have said, and fines will vary depending on several
factors.
   Sheep will be barred from the area in an effort to help increase
vegetation and preserve the topsoil.
   Pilot projects also will be tried during the quarantine,
including one irrigation effort possibly involving pipelines run
from wells on private land.
   Delaney said he was surprised by the support the tortoise
preservation effort has garnered, even from off-road vehicle groups
affected by the closure. Members of one group have volunteered to
help post quarantine signs, he said.

<TEXT>
   With three days left before the Oct. 1 start
of the new federal budget year, Senate Chaplain Richard Halverson
began the chamber's deliberations Thursday with a timely prayer.
   ``Benevolent Lord, grant to thy servants, laboring under the
urgent necessity of the fiscal deadline, relief from tension,'' he
intoned.
   Few others detect a sense of urgency among lawmakers working on
spending and deficit-cutting legislation. Failing once again to
complete their budget work by the start of the new fiscal year,
members of Congress have demonstrated that they care little about
meeting fiscal deadlines.
   That attitude is widely expected to be demonstrated again Oct.
16. That day, the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will
automatically trigger spending cuts in many federal programs unless
$6 billion in savings are enacted into law _ an action that few
people believe Congress will take.
   Those automatic cuts _ split evenly between defense and domestic
programs _ were written into law with the belief that the slashes
would be so draconian that their mere threat would drive lawmakers
to settle their differences and finish their work.
   This year, fear of those cuts is hard to find.
   ``The talk around here is incredibly unfocused and unconcerned
about'' the cuts, complains Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   Many legislators believe that even if the cuts take effect, they
will eventually be rolled back _ as they have in the past _ and
noticed by few if any voters.
   ``There will be some bad publicity and some ill effect, but
ultimately it will be nullified and we'll move on,'' says Rep. Tim
Penny, D-Minn., a fiscal conservative who believes the process must
be made stricter.
   Technically, the cuts temporarily take effect Oct. 1. Defense
Department programs will have 4.3 percent of their budgets
withheld, while domestic agencies will be pared by 5.3 percent, the
difference arising because many domestic programs _ like Social
Security _ are exempted.
   If legislation is not enacted by Oct. 16 trimming the deficit to
$110 billion, those temporary cuts become permanent.
   But the permanent reductions do little to frighten lawmakers for
several reasons.
   The cuts can be rolled back by Congress at any time, as happened
in 1987 when they lasted two months.
   They would be barely noticed if they lasted only several weeks,
because agencies can juggle their budgets by delaying purchases or
hiring. And many lawmakers prefer them to the alternatives: the
capital gains tax reduction Bush champions, higher taxes that some
Democrats have suggested, or deep cuts in specific programs.
   ``People have said, `Let's have it and see how bad it is,'''
said Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., ranking Republican on the House
Budget Committee.
   Lawmakers clearly have higher priorities than obeying budget law
deadlines or avoiding spending cuts. Among them are enacting new
programs, and protecting favored existing ones from spending cuts.
   For example, the tax bill the House will continue debating this
week _ designed to save $16.6 billion _ would earn new revenues and
cut spending on some government programs.
   But it is also loaded down with provisions extending federal
child care services, restricting dial-a-porn companies, and other
pet causes sought by lawmakers. Many of these are so controversial
that they can slow _ or perhaps even kill _ the entire bill.
   Chief of these is the Bush capital gains plan, which Democrats
fought bitterly _ and unsuccessfully _ in the House last week and
will continue to oppose in the Senate. The fight has left deep
wounds.
   ``That poisons the well for the relations you need if you're
going to tackle this seriously,'' said House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   So far, Congress has sent Bush just one of the 13 annual
spending bills for fiscal 1990.
   Lawmakers are expected to spend the next few weeks on the
remaining 12 measures, and even longer on the tax bill.
   Their fearlessness about triggering spending cuts, and their
stubbornness to defend programs dear to them, will do little to
spur rapid work. It also leaves many people convinced that
budget-process reform would do little good.
   ``I can think of nothing I could do that would keep politicians
from doing what they think is politically imperative at any given
point in time,'' says Carol Cox, president of the Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan watchdog group.

<HEAD>Berlin Children Get Lesson About Cold War with Candy Bars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Air Force transport plane on Saturday made
a ``candy drop'' to sweeten a history lesson for about 100 German
children during a re-enactment of the Berlin Airlift 40 years ago.
   The airlift provided about 2 million tons of food, coal and
other goods to Berliners after the Soviets in East Germany cut off
overland access to west Berlin.
   The airlift began on June 26, 1948, and ended Sept. 30, 1949. By
the time the blockade was lifted more than 277,000 planeloads of
supplies had been delivered to Berlin.
   On Saturday, sacks attached to parachutes floated onto the
tarmac at West Berlin's Templehof Airport as a U.S. Air Force C-130
made a candy drop to mark the 40th anniversary of the last day of
the airlift.
   Candy bars and other treats were given to about 100 German
children present for the re-enactment, said Christina Goodwin, a
spokeswoman for the U.S. air base at Templehof.
   Candy and raisins also were dropped by Allied pilots during the
airlift, helping boost the morale of Berlin's children.
   About 250 airlift veterans from the United States attended
Saturday's ceremonies, according to Ms. Goodwin.
   ``They were really excited about being back here. It's a
terrific trip down memory lane for them,'' she said.
   The Americans included former pilots, crewmembers, ground crews,
radar control officials and others who had taken part in the
airlift, she said.
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, in his address, said the ``Cold
War must be forever past'' and that Berlin should become a ``region
of peace and good neighborliness.''
   The Soviets blocked Berlin's western sectors in 1948 during
disputes with the other occupying powers _ the Americans, French
and British _ over Western plans for close economic ties with West
Germany.

   When a farmer's corn and soybean fields are
separated by 500 feet of rushing water and the nearest bridge means
a 45-mile drive, there's only one way to go _ the Darwin Ferry.
   The ferry is believed to be the last one operating on the Wabash
River. It soon will be carrying combines and grain trucks across
the river between east-central Illinois and Indiana for the harvest.
   ``With the ferry, it's not that big a deal,'' said Danny Gard as
he piloted the ferry toward a muddy dock while taking his pickup
truck to Indiana to inspect fields. ``You don't really think about
farming on both sides of the river.''
   Gard drove off the ferry and through his fields, as a pair of
cranes stood in a small pond surrounded by sorghum, and dry soybean
leaves swirled into the air in the breeze. He eased his truck back
onto the ferry and headed for home.
   ``This is the hard part _ guiding it into the dock,'' said Gard.
``It never fails; there are 90 people there watching you (if you
miss).''
   It is difficult to hire a ferryman for the seasonal work, so
often the farmers have to operate the boat themselves.
   The ferry, a flat, yellow boat with a ramp on each end, usually
carries one piece of farm machinery at a time. During busy seasons,
farmers are lied up at the dock for the five-minute trip.
   Wires connect the ferry to overhead cables that span the river
from state to state. The cable system keeps the ferry from straying
off course in strong currents and brisk winds.
   Power is provided by a gasoline engine rescued from a tractor
more than 35 years ago. It is mounted on a small boat permanently
hooked to the side of the ferry. The little boat rotates 180
degrees so it can push the ferry forward or backward.
   ``I don't know how many times it's been in the river,'' said
Gard, firing up the gasoline engine. ``Whenever the old ferry sank,
the (push boat) sank right along with it.''
   There were plenty of mishaps with an old wooden ferry that
served until 1986.
   Former captain Clarence Lathrop recalled a time when the cables
snapped and the ferry was carried downriver.
   ``Somebody had to come and bring us back up,'' said Lathrop.
``It'd take a couple of motor boats.''
   A runaway grain truck once raced down the hill, over the dock,
across the returning ferry and into the water.
   A tractor and load of soybeans once was lost from the ferry, and
the unoccupied boat sank one winter and had to be repaired in the
spring.
   Finally in 1986, Gard said: ``It sank big time. The boat tipped,
the grain truck slipped off and the boat righted herself. But, she
sank before she got back. The grain was all gone but they pulled
out the truck and it didn't have a scratch on it.''
   The old ferry's remains were laid to rest in a weed patch above
the river; the nine farmers who own and operate the ferry service
had the new yellow steel boat built by a local contractor for about
$30,000 in 1987.
   ``We painted it,'' said Gard. ``We even christened it with a
bottle of champagne.''
   It would hardly seem like Darwin without a ferry. The first one
was put into the Wabash in 1818. Riverboats used to stop at the
town, which was once a bustling hub of commerce but now is home
only to a handful of people.
   Lathrop said at one time there were 50 ferries operating across
the Wabash, but all except the Darwin Ferry disappeared.
   Only the need to farm on both sides of the river saved it.
   ``Some people might not like to take big equipment on the ferry,
but I just don't worry about it,'' said Gard.

   Archbishop Robert Runcie, the head of the Anglican
church who is discussing unification with the Roman Catholic
church, called Saturday for all Christians to accept the pope as a
common leader ``presiding in love.''
   Runcie made his appeal at an evening prayer service midway
through his first official visit to the Vatican. There was no sign
at the service of the anti-papal militant, the Rev. Ian Paisley of
Northern Ireland, who threatened earlier in the day to disrupt
Runcie's four-day trip.
   Pope John Paul II, who attended the service, encouraged efforts
to unify the two churches but said Anglican ordination of women had
``seriously aggravated the differences between us.''
   Anglican leaders have said they expect to achieve unity with
Catholics in the 21st century, but the churches are still divided
over issues ranging from the meaning of the Eucharist to birth
control.
   Addressing a crowd at the 17th-century Church of St. Gregory,
Runcie said there was an urgent need to strengthen and spread
Christianity.
   ``For the universal church, I renew the plea,'' he said. ``Could
not all Christians come to reconsider the kind of primacy the
bishop of Rome (pope) exercised within the early church, a
`presiding in love' for the sake of the unity of the churches in
the diversity of their mission?''
   Runcie, who as archbishop of Canterbury is spiritual head of the
state Church of England and leader of the world's 70 million
Anglicans, did not detail the role he envisioned for the pope.
   However, Anglican leaders do not appear to want the pontiff to
exercise as much authority over their church as he does over his
own 850 million Roman Catholic followers.
   Anglicans, who broke with the Vatican in the 16th century over
the pope's refusal to give King Henry VIII an annulment, are
divided over whether to accept the pope even as a symbolic leader.
   In his address at the prayer service the pope encouraged a
commission created in 1982 to study creating a theological
framework for unity.
   ``But as we meet today, we cannot but acknowledge that events in
recent years have seriously aggravated the differences between us,
making the work of the commission more difficult,'' said the
pontiff.
   John Paul was referring to a decision by some of the Anglican
church's self-governing groups to allow ordination of women as
priests, a practice not permitted in the Catholic church. One such
church, the U.S. Episcopalians, ordained the first Anglican woman
bishop this year in Boston.
   Earlier in the day, Runcie held his second set of talks with
John Paul. Runcie's secretary for ecumenical affairs, the Rev.
Canon Christopher Hill, characterized the talks as ``extremely
warm, very frank.''
   Also Saturday, Paisley, who heads the anti-Catholic Free
Presbyterian Church in Northern Ireland, delivered a written
protest about Runcie's trip to Runcie's press secretary, Eve
Keatley.
   The letter accused Runcie of ``high treason'' for recent remarks
on the pope's leadership.
   Paisley told journalists he hoped to ``spoil the party'' but
refused to say what he would do.

   Israeli politicians on Saturday took an
optimistic view of prospects for peace with Palestinians as Jews
attended prayer services and festive meals for Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish new year.
   But violence continued in the Israeli-occupied territories,
where two Palestinians were reported killed and 12 wounded.
   Troops in the occupied West Bank shot to death a knife-wielding
masked man at a roadblock in the village of Meithalun, military
sources said. Arab reports said the victim was with a group of men
trying to block villagers from leaving for jobs in Israel. Leaders
of the Palestinian uprising had declared a general strike on
Saturday.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, soldiers shot to death
20-year-old Silham Mabruke and wounded six others during clashes in
the area, according to Arab reports. Other Arab reports from the
Gaza Strip said soldiers shot and wounded six Palestinians in
scattered fighting.
   The deaths brought to 577 the number of Palestinians killed by
troops or Jewish settlers in the 21-month-old uprising against
Israeli rule of the occupied lands. Forty Israelis have also been
killed, and 122 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators.
   Israelis observing the Jewish new year 5750 donned holiday garb
and set out on foot for synagogues across the nation. Security was
heavy.
   Rosh Hashana is one of Judaism's holiest days and many
non-observant Jews also attend prayer services on the holiday,
which began Friday at sundown and ends Sunday at sundown.
   ``The peace initiative is alive, fermenting, it is talked about
and argued about,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said in an
interview on Armed Forces radio.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak telephoned Shamir from New York
during a meeting in New York with Foreign Minister Moshe Arens on
Friday and Mubarak and Shamir agreed to continue their dialogue,
Israel radio reported Saturday. Israel radio initially reported
Mubarak and Shamir had agreed to meet but said later that was an
incorrect translation from Hebrew to English and the two leaders
had only agreed to continue their dialogue.
   Mubarak wished Shamir a happy new year in the rare conversation
and said he did not want to see the unity goverment of Israel
divided over a proposal the Egyptian leader put forth to promote
talks between the Jewish state and Palestinians, according to the
radio report.
   But Shamir rejected Mubarak's suggestion that Israel trade
territory for peace and negotiate with the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which Israel considers a terrorist group.
   ``Our peace initiative is based on the idea that the PLO will
not be a determining party, they will not be a factor in the area.
They will be a bothersome party, yes,'' Shamir said.
   Palestinians participating in the uprising in the occupied lands
are demanding an independent state.
   ``To whom should we return these territories? To the
Palestinians? Then you are favoring a Palestinian state,'' Shamir
said.
   Israel's peace initiative calls for Palestinian elections,
followed by interim self-rule and negotiations over the permanent
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, home to 1.7 million Arabs.
   Shamir said his Likud bloc and the rival Labor Party of Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Finance Minister Shimon Peres oppose a
Palestinian state.
   Labor does, however, favor some territorial compromise.
   A split developed recently between Likud and Labor, partners in
the coalition government, over Mubarak's invitation to hold talks
in Cairo with a Palestinian delegation including several Arabs
expelled from the occupied lands. Peres accepted the participation
of the deportees but Likud rejected it.
   ``The time has never been riper to start negotiations unless we
want to live always by the sword,'' Peres told Armed Forces radio
Saturday. He said Israel would not accept a PLO delegation as
partners for negotiations but that there was no harm in the PLO
approving the representatives.

<HEAD>Tourists Spent Less in Massachusetts in Summer of '89</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vacationers kept more of their money to themselves
this summer in Massachusetts, and tourism officials blamed consumer
jitters about the economy for the decline in spending.
   The Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism reported that two
out of every three attractions and museums statewide showed a drop
in visitors for an overall decline of 7 percent to 8.3 million
visitors, while hotel occupancy rates, a key indicator of travel
spending, dropped each month from March through July.
   ``Massachusetts had as many summer visitors as last year, but
travelers' concerns about economic conditions were reflected in
reduced spending throughout the state,'' tourism Director Richard
P. Rust said in a prepared statement issued with the recently
released report.
   ``The result was that many tourism businesses had a
disappointing season compared to last year's banner summer,'' he
said
   The dollar value of the declines in tourism was not included in
the report and could not be obtained Saturday.
   Hotels and motels saw fewer overnight guests. April showed the
sharpest decline, down 5.7 percent from last year.
   Attendance at state beaches declined 5.2 percent from 1988, to
5.6 million this year, while there were only 1.6 million visitors
at the state's parks, a 7.6 percent decline from last summer.
   Even sure perennials such as the Boston Tea Party Ship and
Museum suffered. The waterside diversion received 12.9 percent
fewer visitors _ a drop to 69,136 tourists from last year. The
attraction features a small museum and a full-scale replica of one
of the three ships from which rebellious colonists dumped tea into
Boston Harbor to protest the British tea tax.

   Mid-afternoon rain and thunderstorms also were reported in
Virginia, South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, the Florida
Panhandle, Alabama and Mississippi. Showers also fell in Montana,
Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and Arkansas.
   A flash flood watch was posted through the night over northern
Georgia, the eastern half of Tennessee, the western half of North

   The helicopter was returning from a mission on the northern, or
Atlantic, side of the Panama Canal to Howard Air Force Base when it
went down, according to Southern Command spokeswoman Mercedes
Morris.
   She said the identifications of the victims would not be

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has approved the Department of
Energy's $78 million settlement offer in a class-action lawsuit
filed on behalf of 14,000 people who live near the government's
Fernald uranium plant.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel ruled Friday that the
offer made by the Energy Department, which owns the Feed Materials
Processing Center, was fair and reasonable.
   The offer, which was made June 30, settles a $300 million claim
by neighbors who said the plant lowered their property values and
inflicted emotional suffering. The settlement includes money for
long-term medical monitoring of potential health risks to nearby
residents. It also calls for the government to deposit the money in
a court-supervised fund by Oct. 15.
   ``It was like everything fell into place, and it was really
good,'' said Lisa Crawford of the Fernald Residents for
Environmental Safety and Health, or FRESH.
   ``From the beginning we thought it was a good and fair
settlement. We never had any problem with it,'' Mrs. Crawford said.
   Mrs. Crawford and her husband filed the lawsuit in January 1985.
In September 1986, the lawsuit was certified as a class-action
claim representing the residents and businesses within five miles
of the plant.
   Spiegel rejected the Energy Department's contention that the
settlement relieves the government from other claims that the
plant's neighbors might make for reimbursement of property cleanup
costs. He said the neighbors are still free to file separate legal
claims.
   The 38-year-old plant located 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati
processes uranium for use in nuclear reactors and weapons.
   Stanley Chesley, the lead lawyer for the residents, has said
lawyers expect the monitoring will last 30 to 40 years and track
such things as lung cancer and kidney diseases usually associated
with uranium pollution. The monitoring must still be approved by a
court-appointed master.

   A United Airlines jet from Osaka, Japan,
blew eight of its 18 tires when it landed Saturday, but none of the
more than 300 people on board was injured, officials said.
   There was no warning before the tires, all on the right side of
the Boeing 747 jet, blew about 10:30 a.m. at San Francisco
International Airport, said United spokeswoman Deborah Jones at the
airline's headquarters in Chicago.
   The pilot of United Flight 810 did not lose control but was
unable to get the jet all the way off a taxiway, closing the runway
until shortly after 1 p.m., said airport spokesman Ron Wilson.
   The passengers were then taken by bus from the plane to the
terminal, he said.
   Wilson said 350 people were on board but Jones said there were
307, including 289 passengers and a crew of 18.
   The jet has eight tires on each side and two in front.
   ``It's not uncommon to have a tire blow, or two,'' Wilson said.
``But it's unusual to have eight go.''
   The plane was taken to United's maintenance base at the airport
for repair of minor damage, Jones said.

   President Alan Garcia on Saturday named
Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox to also serve as prime
minister.
   Larco Cox replaced Luis Alberto Sanchez who resigned Thursday as
prime minister to campaign for re-election to the Senate.
   Garcia said Larco Cox would continue in the post of foreign
minister and also carry out the duties of prime minister.
   It is the second time Larco Cox has served as prime minister in
Garcia's four-year-old government.
   Sanchez became prime minister last May 15. He was required by
the constitution to resign by Oct. 8 to be eligible for next
April's election.
   In a customary gesture, the other ministers in the 15-member
Cabinet offered their resignations after Sanchez resigned. Garcia
said he would name the new Cabinet within the next few days after
he confers with Larco Cox. Most of the members are expected to be
reconfirmed.
   Garcia's term ends July 28, 1990. He is barred by the
constitution from seeking re-election.

   The Toronto Blue Jays captured the American
League East title Saturday when they rallied with three runs in the
eighth inning to beat the Baltimore Orioles, 4-3.
   The Blue Jays ended their September duel with the Orioles,
winning for the second straight day with an eighth-inning comeback.
Mookie Wilson and Fred McGriff tied the score with run-scoring
singles before George Bell hit a sacrifice fly.
   The Orioles' hopes of becoming the first team to go from worst
to first in one season ended in the din of 49,553 screaming fans at
the SkyDome. Baltimore made the fourth-greatest single-season
improvement in history, but it wasn't enough.
   Toronto won its second division championship in five seasons and
will open the playoffs Tuesday night in Oakland.
   Starter Dave Johnson took a two-hitter and 3-1 lead into the
eighth, but left after a leadoff walk to Nelson Liriano. Kevin
Hickey walked Manny Lee and Mark Williamson, 10-5, relieved. Lloyd
Moseby sacrificed and then the Blue Jays' bats took over.
   Frank Wills, 3-1, pitched four scoreless innings and Tom Henke
got his 20th save with a perfect ninth.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and music critic
Virgil Thomson died at his home Saturday after a long illness. He
was 92.
   Thomson died in his sleep about 5 a.m. in the room at
Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel where he had lived almost 50 years, said
his secretary, Jay Sullivan.
   Thomson had a long career as a composer of operas, ballets,
orchestral and choral works, as well as film scores and incidental
music for plays by authors from Shakespeare to Truman Capote.
   He won the Pulitzer Prize for music for his score to the
documentary film ``Louisiana Story,'' in 1949 _ the only time the
Pulitzer has been awarded for a movie score.
   ``We all loved his music and rarely performed it,'' said
composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein. ``Most of us preferred
his unpredictable, provocative prose.
   ``But he will always remain brightly alive in the history of
music, if only for the extraordinary influence his witty and
simplistic music had on his colleagues,'' Bernstein said in a
statement.
   Joseph W. Polisi, president of The Juilliard School, said
Thomson helped give 20th century opera ``a very clearly American
accent.''
   In 1988, Thomson was one of 12 recipients of the National Medal
of Arts, an award created by Congress four years earlier at the
suggestion of President Reagan.
   He worked with several different styles, deriving inspiration
from such sources as Baptist hymns and 19th century popular music.
   Born in Kansas City, Mo., Thomson learned to play piano at age
5. He worked as a church organist as a teen-ager.
   In 1922, he graduated from Harvard University and moved to
Paris, where he studied with famed music teacher Nadia Boulanger
and met the iconoclastic composer, Erik Satie, who was a great
influence on him.
   While in Paris, he met Gertrude Stein and wrote one of his most
famous works, the opera ``Four Saints in Three Acts,'' with her as
librettist in 1928. It premiered in Hartford, Conn., in 1934 and
had a short but successful run on Broadway that same year.
   They also collaborated on ``The Mother of Us All,'' an opera
about Susan B. Anthony which received its first performance in New
York in 1947.
   He settled in New York in 1940 and joined the staff of the New
York Herald Tribune, where he was music critic until 1954.
   His newspaper pieces, described as stylish, bright and
deliberately provocative, were collected into four anthologies.
   In 1982, he won a National Book Critics Circle Award for ``A
Virgil Thomson Reader.''
   Thomson's latest book, ``Music with Words,'' is to be officially
released Oct. 18 by Yale University Press. Sullivan described it as
a ``how-to book for composers, people who are interested in setting
words to music or music to words.''
   ``He always said it was something I should have written 50 years
ago,'' Sullivan said. ``He was very happy he got to see it before
he died.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press before his 90th
birthday, the cherubic, white-haired Thomson said, ``I've got
nothing wrong with me except I'm deaf and overweight. You don't die
from those.''
   Thomson said the hearing problem kept him from enjoying musical
performances more than 10 years ago, but he continued to compose
and kept busy on the lecture circuit.
   He recalled that his first Tribune music review said violinist
Jascha Heifetz played ``silk underwear music'' but joked that when
some other critic is unkind about his own music, ``I'm convinced
the writer is an ignorant pipsqueak and probably in the pay of my
enemies.''
   Thomson, who never married, is survived by a niece, Betty
Stouffer, of Longwood, Fla. He will be buried in a family plot in
Slater, Mo., Sullivan said.
   A memorial service is planned at the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine in Manhattan on Nov. 25 _ what would have been Thomson's
93rd birthday.

   John Thomas Walker, dean of the Washington
National Cathedral and the city's first black bishop, died of heart
failure Saturday, the Episcopal Diocese of Washington said. He was
64.
   Walker had undergone triple bypass surgery at Georgetown
University Hospital on Friday.
   Walker was vice president of the national House of Bishops of
the Episcopal Church.
   An ardent spokesman for racial conciliation, he supported the
installation of women clergy members in the church.
   Walker joined the Episcopal Church in 1947 and came to
Washington in 1966 to work in a program aimed at the city's poorest
neighborhoods.
   The diocese said Rev. Ronald Haines, the suffragan bishop, would
conduct diocesan affairs until a new diocesan bishop is chosen. A
spokesman said a convention would be scheduled in coming months to
choose a new bishop.

   Federal agents made three more arrests in the
world's largest cocaine seizure, bringing to six the number held in
connection with the 20 tons found in a suburban warehouse, an
official said Saturday.
   Workers and business owners in the warehouse complex on an
upscale, tree-lined street said they were suspicious about the
establishment, called Adriana's Pottery Warehouse. Adriana's
prosperous-looking operators claimed to be in the velvet painting
business.
   But when authorities acting on a tip broke into the warehouse by
knocking apart a $6 padlock, they found 20 tons of cocaine, the
largest seizure in the world by a law enforcement agency.
   Its estimated value was between $2 billion and $20 billion,
depending on its final form for sale on the street.
   Three Southern California men were arrested Friday morning in
connection with the case. The other three, all from Los Angeles,
were arrested later Friday in their rooms at the Flamingo Hilton in
Las Vegas.
   A U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency source who requested anonymity
identified the men arrested in Las Vegas as Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68,
his son Hector Eduardo Tapia Ponce, 34, and Hector Tapia, 66, the
brother of Carlos.
   The source said Carlos Tapia Ponce is a former Mexican customs
inspector who had worked in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, for 15 years.
   The three were arrested for investigation of violation of
federal narcotics laws and were booked into the Clark County
Detention Center. Arraignment was set for Monday in U.S. District
Court in Las Vegas.
   The Thursday night raid, 25 miles northwest of downtown near the
San Gabriel Mountain foothills, also yielded extensive records and
at least $10 million in cash, bundled and stuffed in dozens of
boxes.
   ``It didn't seem like a good business,'' said David Barron, the
owner of a construction company that worked out of a warehouse next
door. ``They said they were dealing in paintings _ velvet
paintings. I didn't see a market for that in California.''
   Nonetheless, there were frequent truck deliveries to Adriana's.
Workers in the complex said they came as often as once a week in
the last six months.
   Employees from Adriana's would go from office to office, asking
people to move their cars to make way for the truck.
   Barron said he noticed Adriana's operators ``seemed to be making
an awful lot of money. They were too well-dressed to operate a
warehouse business.''
   Adriana's workers recently spread the word that the deliveries
might start coming twice a week. Barron said some business
operators discussed legal action, or complaining to the police.
   The 20-ton cache was apparently bound for markets across the
United States, but authorities said it already had traveled about
3,500 miles along a route known among law enforcement officials as
``the Trampoline.''
   ``The cocaine is moved from Colombia to Mexico and bounced up
into the United States,'' said Mike Holm, a DEA assistant special
agent in Los Angeles.
   The seizure easily topped the previous U.S. record of about
8,700 pounds recorded in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1987, and
surpassed the world record, a 12-ton seizure in Colombia.

<TEXT>
   The historic international
agreement to allow thousands of East Germans in Czechoslovakia and
Poland to go West underscores the deep political changes at work in
the Soviet bloc.
   In just one eventful night, hard-line Czechoslovakia and
reform-minded Poland have taken their places on the widening route
of East German refugees heading to West Germany.
   Goaded into changes and reforms by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the Warsaw Pact nations are taking a new approach to old
problems.
   In years past, East German refugees in Warsaw and Prague would
have had little hope of a successful exit. An escape from East
Germany often involved a desperate swim, a daring leap, a frenzied
dash, or a heart-stopping flight in a homemade glider across the
border.
   The scene was completely different this weekend. West German
television showed Czechoslovak police standing by idly Saturday
afternoon as refugees carried their few belongings in sacks to the
West German Embassy to prepare for the westward journey.
   Hungary, whose Communist leadership has called for multi-party
elections, first opened the floodgates on Sept. 11 by removing
border fences with Austria. That action launched an exodus that
sent nearly 24,000 East German refugees to West Germany and left
the hard-line Communist leadership in East Germany furious.
   Emboldened by Hungary's action, East German refugees gathered at
West German embassies in Warsaw and Prague, where their numbers
swelled to about 4,100. They dug in their heels waiting for
permission to emigrate.
   The unusual agreement Saturday came after weeks of diplomatic
maneuvering, including a round of talks that just ended in New York
during the U.N. General Assembly session, according to West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He called it ``the most
moving hour of my political work.''
   Genscher stressed the roles of the West German and East German
governments, tactfully leaving out mention of Czechoslovakia and
Poland.
   The issue was sensitive in both countries. Czechoslovakia had
pledged earlier to prevent the East Germans from going to the West.
Despite its reforms and the advent of a government led by a
non-Communist, Poland had balked at agreeing to the refugees'
demands for fear of angering East Germany, a Warsaw Pact ally.
   On Saturday, East Germany said it had agreed to the transfer for
``humanitarian reasons'' and had consulted with both Czechoslovakia
and Poland.
   The official East German news agency ADN wrote of 600 East
Germans in Bonn's embassy in Warsaw being ``expelled.'' ADN also
pointed out that East German trains would take the refugees across
East German territory before they would go on to West Germany.
   The route, a face-saving measure, permitted East Germany to say
that it had allowed the emigrees to go to West Germany from its
territory _ not from Czechoslovakia and Poland.
   Still unknown is what will happen to other East Germans who try
in the future to escape to the West by way of Warsaw and Prague.
East Germany said it expects West Germany to resume ``normal,
international customs'' at its embassies after the transfer.
   Another unanswered question is the amount of pressure West
Germany placed on East Germany to let the refugees go.
   The West Germans appeared to be playing hardball in New York
last week when Genscher skipped the usual niceties at a
face-to-face encounter with his East German counterpart, Oskar
Fischer.

   Anti-abortion activists staged rallies Saturday in several
states, including Florida where lawmakers are about to re-examine
abortion laws in a special session. Nearly 450 people were arrested
nationwide, police said.
   Protests were reported at women's clinics in Pittsburgh,
Milwaukee, Philadelphia, near Detroit, in south Miami, near Boston,
in Phoenix and throughout New Jersey, police said.
   In Pittsburgh, 190 anti-abortion protesters were arrested in
connection with three demonstrations, including one where 25
gallons of tar was spilled on the floor of a clinic's hallway,
police said.
   Six demonstrators forced their way past a worker into the
Women's Health Services Inc. clinic downtown and stood side-by-side
with their feet planted in tar-filled, five-gallon buckets, said
Sue Roselle, executive director of the clinic.
   The tar was spilled when police arrived and tried to take the
protesters to police wagons. The clinic remained open.
   Several hundred protesters also appeared at two clinics in the
city's East Liberty neighborhood, harrying police by repeatedly
moving from the Allegheny Women's Center to the Allegheny
Reproductive Health Center, about a block away.
   In Milwaukee, about 200 anti-abortion demonstrators, including
members of Rescue: Operation Milwaukee, picketed a downtown women's
clinic. Police arrested 134 people for blocking the entrance at the
Affiliated Medical Service Inc., officials said.
   Police in Philadelphia arrested 87 people who were protesting
outside a downtown abortion clinic. Protesters would be charged
with disorderly conduct, failing to disperse and obstructing a
highway, police said.
   In Lathrup Village, Mich., about 300 activists with Operation
Rescue, an anti-abortion group, protested at a suburban Detroit
clinic Saturday, resulting in 29 arrests for blocking doors.
   ``They were arrested for trespassing. They were restricting
people that wanted to enter the building from going in. They were
requested to move and refused,'' said Lathrup Village police Sgt.
Dan Broschay.
   About 1,000 anti-abortion protesters held demonstrations around
New Jersey as part of the fourth annual Pastors' Protest Against
Abortion, organizers said.
   Nobody was arrested in any of the protests at 12 hospitals, said
Dr. Alieta Eck, one of the organizers of the protest at the Robert
Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick.
   In south Miami, several dozen anti-abortion demonstrators
marched Saturday in front of two hospitals, gearing up for
Florida's special legislative session beginning Oct. 10.
   Florida's Legislature is the nation's first to call its
lawmakers together to re-examine its abortion laws following the
U.S. Supreme Court's decision this summer granting states more
freedom in restricting abortions.
   ``A hospital should be an institution of healing and not
killing,'' said Rev. Henry Patino, who led an anti-abortion group
marching in front of South Miami Hospital.
   Elsewhere, in Brookline, Mass., police reported no more than 20
people were staging a demonstration at a Beacon Street abortion
clinic.
   In Phoenix, about 300 demonstrators _ 175 anti-abortion and 125
pro-choice _ protested outside a Planned Parenthood office Saturday
morning. No incidents were reported and no one was arrested, police
said.
   In Glendale, Calif., about three dozen anti-abortion
demonstrators picketed for two hours outside Glendale Memorial
Hospital and left, said police Sgt. Karl Ward. The demonstration
was orderly and there were no arrests.

<HEAD>Court Orders Release of Girl Jailed For Not Testifying Against Father</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An appellate court has ordered the release
of a 14-year-old girl who was being held for contempt of court
after she refused to testify against her father in a sex abuse case.
   A three-judge panel of the appellate division of Superior Court
ordered the girl's release Friday after her lawyers argued that the
trial judge should have conducted a hearing on whether she was able
to testify when she refused.
   The panel set aside the order of Superior Court Judge David G.
Lucas, who sentenced the girl to serve 60 days at the Somerset
County youth shelter, said George N. Rover, a lawyer for the girl.
   Lucas imposed the sentence Thursday after the girl refused four
times in court to testify against her father at his trial on
charges of sexually abusing her.
   ``You have acted intentionally and you have acted with purpose
to defeat the functions of this court,'' Lucas told the girl after
she refused a fourth time to be sworn in as a witness.
   The girl has repeatedly recanted the allegations.
   The appellate court also ordered a hearing to determine if the
girl is competent to testify, Rover said. He said the girl would
live with her grandparents in Somerset County.
   The father is charged with two counts of aggravated sexual
assault and one count each of sexual assault and endangering the
welfare of a child. He is free on $25,000 bond.
   Timothy Van Hise, the assistant prosecutor trying the case, told
jurors during opening arguments Thursday that authorities learned
about the case in December 1987, after the girl told friends about
the alleged abuse. Van Hise said the father was arrested that day
and confessed to police.
   ``Her desire to stay with her father is not as important as his
egregious criminal conduct,'' Van Hise said. ``You don't press or
not press criminal charges because of the will of family members.''
   ``I have no quarrel with what Judge Lucas did. I think he was
compelled to take the action he took,'' Van Hise said.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 former members of a
notorious anti-guerrilla police unit were demobilized Saturday at
their closed base in northern Namibia, the South-West African
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Journalists were not permitted into the base at Oshakati where
an estimated 1,150 black and white officers of Koevoet _ which
means crowbar in the Afrikaans language _ marched and were counted
by members of a U.N. mission. The U.N. force is monitoring the
process leading to independence elections for South-West Africa,
now a territory administered by South Africa. The territory also is
known as Namibia.
   The South African Press Association said the former Koevoet
troopers had turned in their uniforms and weapons earlier.
   They had been confined to the Oshakati base since last month,
receiving retraining in ordinary police duties, but they were
allowed to go to their homes at night.
   Since April, when the United Nations began monitoring the
transition to independence, U.N. observers have been calling for
removal of members of the Koevoet unit from the police force.
   Many Koevoet troopers were accused of atrocities during the
23-year bush war between South Africa and the South-West African
People's Organization. SWAPO supporters in northern Namibia claimed
Koevoet members continued to harass and intimidate civilians after
a cease-fire went into effect in April.
   The United Nations, which is responsible for assuring that the
Nov. 7-11 elections are free and fair, adopted a resolution on Aug.
29 calling for the complete demobilization of Koevoet.
   Louis Pienaar, South African administrator of the territory,
disbanded Koevoet as a formal unit and confined them to base. He
suggested they be allowed to remain in the police force until they
were retrained, but his spokesman, Gerhard Roux, said the United
Nations rejected the proposal.
   Roux said Friday that Pienaar was concerned that if the former
Koevoet troopers were responsibile for illegal behavior as
policemen ``now they will be spread out around the country with no
one to control them.''
   Martti Ahtisaari, the U.N. special representative for Namibia,
said in July that 80 percent of the Koevoet members could not write
out a police report and were therefore unfit for normal police
duties. ``Their skills must lie elsewhere,'' he said.
   In another development, SWAPO President Sam Nujoma called on the
United Nations Saturday to take further steps to stop the
``emerging culture of violence'' in the territory. He spoke at the
funeral of Anton Lubowski, the organization's only white executive
member who was assassinated three weeks ago.
   Nujoma, who returned to Namibia recently after some 30 years in
exile, said the failure of police to formally charge anyone with
Lubowski's murder ``smacks of a cover-up.'' Police say they have
arrested an Irishman named Donald Acheson for questioning but no
charges have been filed.
   Lubowski's body was cremated at a private service a week ago.
About 500 people attended the funeral service Saturday at the
Katatura Lutheran Church in a black township near Windhoek, the
capital.

   A woman who underwent two liver transplant
operations while she was pregnant has given birth to a boy, Johns
Hopkins Hospital officials said.
   Martha Maynor, 21, gave birth Friday to Matthew James Maynor by
Caesarian section. Both were in good condition on Saturday, said
hospital spokeswoman Debbie Bangledorf.
   Matthew, 10 weeks premature, weighed 2 pounds, 10 ounces.
   Ms. Maynor was about 22 weeks pregnant when she had the first
liver transplant July 27. A second liver was transplanted three
days later when the first failed. Ms. Maynor's own liver was
destroyed by the Hepatitus B virus.
   Doctors said they had no way of knowing how the fetus would
respond to the anti-rejection drugs his mother was taking.
   Hospital officials said the baby was delivered after tests
indicated the fetus had stopped growing and complications were
likely if the pregnancy continued.

<TEXT>
   The remains of Montenegro's last king
were returned to his homeland Saturday for a ceremonial reburial
representing the first time Communist authorities have officially
recognized Yugoslavia's royal past.
   The ceremony will entail pageantry unseen in this former Balkan
kingdom since the 1860 coronation of the king, Nikola
Petrovic-Njegos. Royal family members scattered across Europe by
decades of turmoil received enthusiastic welcomes as they arrived
for the reburial.
   Nikola ruled Montenegro, today the smallest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, until 1916, when he was forced into exile by advancing
Austro-Hungarian troops.
   His state funeral and that of his queen, Milena, are scheduled
for Sunday. Her remains were returned with those of Nikola.
   The event represents a milestone in the official stance toward
the nation's history. Until recently, the king was regularly
denounced and ridiculed.
   ``If you had so much as mentioned the king 10 years ago, you
would have landed in jail,'' remarked a bus driver, Luka
Garlasevic, in an interview.
   Remaining in exile after World War I, Nikola died in Italy in
1921, and his mountain domain was incorporated into the
newly-established south Slav kingdom by his nephew, Serbian monarch
Aleksandar I Karadjordjevic.
   Montenegrin and Serbian media have given prominence to the
arrival of members of the former Yugoslav royal family and their
Italian relatives, who will attend the reburial.
   Members of Europe's aristrocracy not seen in Yugoslavia since
the abolishment of the monarchy and the Communist takeover in 1945
were at hand to observe the arrival of the king's remains Saturday.
They were brought to the southern Adriatic port of Bar in
Montenegro on an Italian military boat.
   Prince Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia of Italy, Prince Dimitri
Romanov of Russia and other relatives from elsewhere in Europe were
given warm welcomes on their arrival.
   Hundreds of onlookers crowded around three princesses of the
Karadjordjevic dinasty, which ruled Yugoslavia until the Communist
took power.
   However, Princess Jelisaveta Karadjordjevic told The Associated
Press that Crown Prince Aleksandar, pretender to the Yugoslav
crown, could not come from London ``because of unresolved political
questions.''
   She did not elaborate but apparently was alluding to
Communist-imposed restrictions on all male members of the
Karadjordjevic family.
   Over 20,000 people gathered at the harbor of Bar to welcome the
Italian warship ``San Marco'' with Nikola's remains. Several
Montenegrins in traditional caps ringed the cortege as the coffins
of the king and queen were driven off the ship by Yugoslav navy
vehicles.
   The reburial of the remains in nearby Cetinje, which served as
capital of Nikola's realm, was organized by Montenegro's Communist
authorities. They will be granting his last wish.
   The ceremony will be conducted by priests of the local Orthodox
church, which Nikola headed as bishop during his reign.
   Under Yugoslavia's Communist rulers, the Orthodox church, though
allowed to carry on its activities, has not been permitted any
voice in public affairs.
   The involvement of the church in the reburial appears to reflect
a desire of the new Montenegrin Communist leadership to gain broad
popular support after ethnic and economic protests last winter
forced the entire ruling elite to resign.
   Nikola's achievements still evoke pride among Montenegrins. In a
series of battles against Ottoman Turks, Nikola managed to triple
the area of his small realm and keep it independent.

   Thousands of people urging the legalization
of marijuana gathered Saturday outside the state Capitol in an
annual rally that features music, chanting and considerable smoking.
   ``We're here to exercise our First Amendment rights,'' a
protester told the crowd while waving what appeared to be a
marijuana cigarette.
   Capitol security chief Michael Metcalf estimated between 6,000
and 7,000 people participated. Police took a number of people into
the building, and citations were issued, Metcalf said.
   One protester carried a large American flag with a marijuana
plant outlined over the field of stars.
   The rally came one day after Gov. Tommy G. Thompson announced
his proposal for the Legislature to punish teen-agers caught with
narcotics, and to toughen the penalties against drug pushers.
   The governor said he wants to ``push the pushers into a corner,
to sweep them off the streets quickly and place them in lockup.''
   His plan would ``deal sternly with the users ... even the
so-called casual users,'' he said.

   Wounded soldiers, some wearing hospital
attire, were among the 1,500 people who gathered Saturday to mourn
the loss of three comrades killed in an artillery accident.
   Three pairs of boots, three helmets and three upside-down M-16s
with bayonets stood in front of the platform where three Fort Sill
privates gave eulogies for the soldiers.
   ``The emptiness of death is symbolized by the empty boots and
the empty helmets,'' said post spokesman Lt. Col. John Dobbs. ``The
upside down rifle signifies that a comrade-in-arms has fallen.''
   Pvts. 1 Jimmy McCain, 21, of Troy, Ala., and Edward Zastrow, 18,
of Lester Prairie, Minn., and Spec. Thomas Boyle of Ventura,
Calif., were killed Wednesday when an artillery round went nearly a
half-mile off course and exploded near the troops standing in
formation.
   Twenty-four soldiers were wounded. Some of the wounded were
released from the hospital to attend the memorial Saturday, Dobbs
said.
   The memorial, which lasted about 25 minutes, was held outdoors
among the buildings where the fallen soldiers of the A Battery, 2nd
Battalion, 80th Field Artillery, lived, ate and trained, Dobbs said.
   Four chaplains participated in the service, giving the
invocation, reading scriptures, leading a prayer and providing
words of comfort, Dobbs said.
   Battery commander Capt. Mark Wood also spoke.
   ``As we struggle to cope with this tragedy, we can take solace
in our belief that these three fallen soldiers were selfless,
decent men who must sure have found a special place by our just
Lord's side,'' Wood said.
   Seventeen soldiers remained in the hospital Saturday, Dobbs said.

   A woman who gave birth in an
airplane bathroom and stuffed the infant in a wastebasket won't go
to jail until December because she is expecting another baby soon,
officials said.
   Christina LoCasto of New York City was to begin a six-month jail
term Oct. 14, but a San Mateo County Superior Court judge decided
Friday that her sentence should begin after the birth of her fourth
child, which is due in mid-October.
   LoCasto, 25, pleaded no contest in May to a charge of felony
child endangerment in a plea bargain. She could have been sentenced
to six years in prison if she had been tried and convicted.
   The mother of two other children, LoCasto gave birth in the
bathroom of a United Airlines flight between Newark, N.J., and San
Francisco. The baby was found under the sink shortly after the
airplane landed at San Francisco International Airport on July 13,
1988.
   LoCasto told caseworkers last year she was afraid to tell her
husband about her third pregnancy because they were having marital
problems.
   A juvenile court judge awarded temporary custody of the baby,
named Alyssa, to her paternal grandparents. Another hearing on her
custody will be held Oct. 25.

   A Mormon Church apostle on Saturday
apologized for the leadership's human frailties, brought on by old
age, but issued a call for obedience to church decrees.
   ``We are sorry for our inadequacies, sorry that we are not
better than we are. We see, as you see, the erosion of age as it
limits and enfeebles his leaders before your very eyes,'' said
Elder Boyd K. Packer, 65.
   The 15 members of the governing First Presidency and Twelve
Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints average
69 years of age and serve under a system of apostolic succession
until death.
   Packer and other members of the Quorum of the Mormon Church
convened the faith's 159th Semiannual General Conference with calls
for obedience to revelation.
   ``There are those within the church who are disturbed when
changes they propose are not made, or when changes are made with
which they disagree,'' Packer said. ``They point to these changes
as evidence that the leaders are not inspired.''
   Such critics are ``always irritated by the word `obedience' and
always they question revelation. It always has been so,'' Packer
said.
   The remarks seemed aimed to counter criticism from George P.
Lee, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy and a Navajo, who
was excommunicated a month ago in a dispute over for the doctrinal
role of Indians in the faith.
   Members of the church's hierarchy also condemned drug use as a
form of murder, reaffirmed that women cannot hold the priesthood
and said the safety of thousands of young missionaries amid
political turmoil abroad is ``a paramount concern.''
   The Mormons' president, Ezra Taft Benson, attended the gathering
in the Tabernacle on Temple Square, but one of his counselors,
Thomas S. Monson, read the 90-year-old church's leader's address.
Benson praised the faith's elderly and counseled their families to
honor them.
   Elder James E. Faust of the Twelve said that while he and his
brethren make no claim to infallibility or perfection, their
responsibility is to receive revelation for the entire 6.7
million-member church.

<HEAD>Dissidents Call an End to Protest at Polish Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident parishoners of a
predominantly Polish Roman Catholic church say they have ended
their 41-week demonstration calling for the resignation of their
pastor.
   ``We're frustrated and it's time to stop,'' said Brian Syc, a
spokesman for the group.
   The protesters were calling for removal of the Rev. John Bambol,
pastor at St. Michael the Archangel Church. The group says it will
continue to withhold financial support from the parish and attend
other churches until its demands are met.
   ``This is not a happy occasion,'' Vincent Knapczyk, another
spokesman, said Friday. ``We accomplished something. We showed that
people could unite if they think something is important.'' For 10
months, demonstrators had gathered on the street outside the church
to sing and protest.
   When told about the end of the protest, Bambol said he didn't
care what the group decided to do, calling its demands senseless.
   ``I didn't pay attention to those people. They disturbed and
harassed people in the church. It will be a relief for the people
in church,'' Bambol said.
   The schism that divided the parish began in the summer of 1988
and exploded in December when Bambol called for the opening of the
church to non-Poles. His recommendation sparked an angry reaction
from some parishoners who said the proposal threatened the Polish
character of the parish.
   Shortly after the protests began, the Rev. Roman Palaszewski,
who was popular with many recent Polish immigrants, was ordered to
leave the parish by the Franciscan Order. Some parishioners blamed
Bambol for the priest's transfer and occupied the church for a week.
   The sit-in ended Feb. 18, when church authorities summoned
police to evict the demonstrators. The church then closed for three
Sundays.
   Palaszewski eventually was suspended by his superiors for not
returning to Poland as he was ordered to do. The priest went into
hiding and became the rallying point for the protesters.
   Since then, Palaszewski has traveled to the Vatican to plead to
stay in the United States. He remains in Poland awaiting a decision
on his request, Syc said.

   With cheers and tears, more than 800 East
German refugees in Warsaw heard a West German diplomat announce
Saturday night they could take a train to the West and ``go
tomorrow to the Octoberfest in Munich.''
   The announcement followed a highly unusual East-West accord that
also allows about 3,500 East Germans in Czechoslovakia to go to
West Germany. The latest East German refugees will be following
23,000 countrymen who emigrated this month through Hungary after
earlier diplomatic talks.
   The East Germans in Warsaw assembled late Saturday at the West
German Embassy to prepare for their trip. The embassy had been
closed for more than a week to prevent additional East Germans from
taking refuge there.
   Applause interrupted the West German diplomat at virtually every
sentence as he told the East Germans they would leave Warsaw's
Eastern Station by train at about 2:50 a.m. Sunday (9:50 p.m. EDT
Saturday) en route to their new lives in West Germany.
   And at 2:50 a.m. the train pulled out with 809 refugees aboard
for the journey to the West German border city of Helmstedt. The
trip was expected to take about 10 hours.
   The train would stop only once in East Germany, where the
refugees would receive their emigration papers, the diplomat said.
They were escorted by West German State Secretary Jurgen Sudhoff
and Franz Bertle, head of the West German mission in East Germany.
   The diplomat told the crowd of jubilant refugees they would
arrive in time to attend the traditional fall festival, the
Octoberfest, in Munich.
   Tears streamed down the refugees' faces as they hugged each
other and left the crowded embassy hall to pack their belongings.
   ``I am happy, I am happy'' one young man said, speaking through
the bars of the compound gates.
   The refugees arranged their overstuffed luggage, backpacks and
teddy bears. They bundled up their children against the chill, wet
evening and finished assembling the few possessions they would be
taking with them.
   Along the tree-lined streets a dozen buses from the state
tourism agency were parked to take the refugees to the train
station.
   Earlier in the evening, those refugees who had been allowed to
live near the embassy in a residential section of Warsaw were
escorted to the compound, where others had waited out the
diplomatic talks. Some had been there for more than a month.
   Poland, where Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has headed the
East bloc's only non-communist government since Sept. 12, had taken
a cautious approach to the delicate diplomatic problem.
   While the reform-oriented government wanted to see the East
Germans given passage to the West, Poland was sensitive to
straining relations with East Germany, its neighbor and Warsaw Pact
ally. When he took office, Mazowiecki pledged to respect Warsaw
Pact commitments.
   On Thursday, after negotiations with East German envoy Wolfgang
Vogel, about 50 refugees in Poland accepted their government's
offer to emigrate legally if they returned home.
   On Saturday, East Germany said it had agreed to let the refugees
in Poland and Czechoslovakia go to the West and that Poland had
been consulted in the decision.
   During their stay, the refugees in Poland ate food bought for
them at hotels and markets around Warsaw. Trucks from West Germany
brought in bunk beds and other supplies, and humanitarian agencies
made donations.

   A coral-encrusted battery and two
pieces of aluminum found off a South Pacific atoll did not come
from an aircraft, say members of a team searching for the wreckage
of Amelia Earhart's plane.
   Divers found the items Monday, leading to speculation they may
have come from Earhart's plane, which vanished 52 years ago with
her and navigator Fred Noonan aboard during an attempt to fly
around the world.
   The searchers reported Friday they had concluded the pieces did
not come from an aircraft, said spokesmen Tom Gannon, in telephone
interviews from Suva, Fiji.
   ``It's back to square one, I guess,'' said Gannon, a retired Air
Force navigator from this florida panhandle city.
   Gannon and Tom Willi, a retired Navy pilot, are at a
communications post in Fiji linked with 28 members of the
expedition on Nikumaroro Island, about 900 miles to the north in
the Phoenix Islands group.
   Willi and Gannon persuaded the International Group for Historic
Aircraft Recovery to search for Earhart's plane after they used
1930s navigational techniques to plot a course indicating the plane
may have gone down on or near Nikumaroro, a small, jungle atoll.
   Expedition leader Rick Gillespie contacted Willi on Friday with
a terse message saying that the items found were no longer
considered aircraft-related.
   Gillespie said he believed the battery was discarded by natives
who settled on the island in 1938, a year after the plane vanished.
The atoll was abandoned in the 1950s after the islanders'
British-sponsored attempt to develop a coconut palm industry failed.
   The searchers concluded that a 7-foot-long aluminum pipe was too
big and heavy to have come from an aircraft. And it seemed unlikely
that a solid, egg-shaped chunk of aluminum found was an airplane's
brake drum, as Gillespie first theorized, Willi said.
   Gillespie will continue the expedition and return with the
search vessel to Fiji on Oct. 10, Gannon said.

   A tractor-trailer loaded with steel coils crashed into a
disabled tourist bus in Cleveland Saturday, injuring 22 people. In
Iowa, a car rammed a school bus carrying band students in an
accident that injured 12, police said.
   No fatalities were reported in either accident, police said.
   In Cleveland, the bus, known as Lolly the Trolley and designed
to resemble a trolley, was used to carry visitors on sight-seeing
tours. It had stopped because of mechanical problems in one of the
lanes of the ``innerbelt'' freeway carrying traffic from Interstate
71 to Interstate 90, said Sgt. Kenneth Kirchner.
   The 18-wheel truck was unable to stop and struck the bus about
11 a.m., pinning the driver inside his truck, he said.
   Twenty-two people were taken to hospitals and five were
admitted, officials said. None was in serious condition late
Saturday, officials said.
   The truck driver, Noah Miller, 55, of Colon, Mich., was treated
and released at Lutheran Medical Center, said a hospital
spokeswoman.
   Miller was ticketed for failing to maintain a safe distance in
front of his rig.
   In Dubuque, Iowa, a car crashed into the bus that was carrying a
Wisconsin junior high school band, knocking it into a ditch. The
car then hit a truck carrying band equipment, officials said.
   There were 42 people on board the bus and three in the equipment
truck, said Dubuque County sheriff's deputy Jim Schmitt.
   Twelve people were admitted to hospitals. None of the students
was critically hurt, authorities said.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, saying a
historic opportunity for peace in the Middle East is at hand,
called on Israel to open talks with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In an address Friday before the U.N. General Assembly, he also
urged Israel to swap territory captured in Mideast wars for peace.
   Israel has steadfastly refused to negotiate with the PLO,
calling it a terrorist organization dedicated to destruction of the
Jewish state.
   Mubarak called the PLO ``the sole, legitimate representative of
the Palestinian people.'' He said the organization had adopted
positive attitudes toward a peace settlement and ``deserves all
welcome and support from the international community.''

   President Bush's capital gains tax cut, which
won a bitter fight in the House, may face trouble in the Senate
because of concerns that it is ill-timed and gives too large a tax
savings to the nation's richest people.
   The Senate has traditionally leaned strongly toward such
reductions, but some senators who have favored capital gains cuts
in the past find the new proposal unacceptable because of the
current budget deficit and its tilt to the wealthy.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and
longtime backer of lower taxes on capital gains, said he will
recommend that a capital gains cut not be included when the
committee begins work Monday on a deficit-reduction plan.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, said Friday that an incentive for saving and
investment is needed, but a temporary cut followed by an increased
rate ``would destabilize the markets. It's sheer budget gimmickry.''

   House and Senate negotiators are telling
federal arts agencies not to give any money to obscene art, but
they're backing away from stronger standards proposed by Sen. Jesse
Helms.
   Under a compromise reached Friday, the National Endowment for
the Arts and National Endowment for the Humanities would receive
budgets in the 1990 fiscal year provided they implement new
standards in giving grants.
   The provision is a weakening of a Senate-passed measure backed
by Helms, R-N.C., that called for banning federal aid for art that
is ``obscene or indecent'' or that ``denigrates'' a religion, race,
ethnic background, age group or handicap.
   Instead, grants would be denied to art that depicts
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children
or ``individuals engaged in the sex act.''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor, convicted of battery
for slapping a police officer and two other misdemeanor charges,
said her fame and outspoken self-defense led to the verdict _ which
she called ``ridiculous.''
   ``I know it's Zsa Zsa Gabor _ the diamonds. She loves to talk
up, she's not a milquetoast,'' said the actress, whose courtroom
outbursts and often outrageous out-of-court commentary on such
topics as police brutality and lesbianism had attracted news media
from around the world.
   The jury returned guilty verdicts Friday against Miss Gabor on
charges she slapped a motorcycle officer during a traffic stop and
was driving without a valid driver's license and with an open
container of alcohol in her car.
   The Hungarian-born star of such movies as ``Queen of Outer
Space'' and ``Picture Mommy Dead'' was acquitted on a fourth count
of disobeying Beverly Hills police Officer Paul Kramer as she drove
away while he was still checking her motor vehicle record on June
14.

   Former CIA and KGB spies agreed
after a remarkable meeting that one man's terrorist isn't another
man's freedom fighter, and called for a U.S.-Soviet effort to
combat ``morally reprehensible'' violence.
   ``Practical steps must be taken to combat the danger of
international terrorism and eliminate the conditions under which it
has operated with impunity,'' Lt. Gen. Fjodor Sherbak, former
deputy chief of the Soviet KGB's Second Directorate, said Friday at
the end of the weeklong conference.
   Ray Cline, deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency
from 1962 to 1966, agreed.
   ``We have a common interest in knocking this thing off. ... This
very dangerous phenomenon is tearing at the fabric of international
civilization,'' Cline said.
   The meeting of more than 20 members of the private U.S.-Soviet
Task Force to Prevent Terrorism was held behind closed doors at the
Rand Corp., a Santa Monica-based think tank.

   The Soviets once called crime a product of
capitalism, meaning it wasn't their problem. Now, officials
acknowledge the Soviet Union has the fastest-growing crime rate in
the world and say they are alarmed.
   Lawbreaking was up 50 percent in some areas this year. To cope,
the KGB secret police has been enlisted to combat racketeering and
lawmakers endorsed an emergency anti-crime program.
   In crime increases,``lamentably, the Soviet Union is now No.
1,'' said Gennady V. Dashkov, an official at a Moscow-based
research institute affiliated with the state prosecutor's office.
   In the Central Russian city of Gorky, workers created vigilante
groups called ``workers militias'' to combat crime. In Moscow, new
French-built armored cars now pick up the day's receipts from large
stores and savings banks.
