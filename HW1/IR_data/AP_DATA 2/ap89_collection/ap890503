   The U.S. Supreme Court refused
Wednesday to stay the execution of a convicted child killer
scheduled to die Thursday morning, after his attorneys lost similar
appeals in three lower courts.
   The emergency request by Aubrey Dennis Adams Jr. was denied by
the high court in a 7-2 vote. The justices also turned down his
formal appeal to review his death sentence.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose
the death penalty in all circumstances, voted to spare Adams.
   Earlier Wednesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta denied a request for a stay of execution for Adams, saying
it didn't ``find merit in any of the claims raised.''
   The 11th Circuit's decision Wednesday night followed rejection
of Adams' appeal by the Florida Supreme Court in the morning and by
U.S. District Judge John H. Moore II in the afternoon.
   The Supreme Court appeal was filed in anticipation of the lower
court rejections, said Larry Spalding, head of the state agency
that handles final appeals for inmates facing execution.
   Adams, 31, a former officer at Marion Correctional Institution
in Ocala, was originally scheduled to die Tuesday for the murder of
an 8-year-old Marion County girl, but the state Supreme Court
issued a 48-hour stay Monday.
   He is scheduled to die in the electric chair at Florida State
Prison near Starke at 7 a.m. EDT Thursday.
   If Adams is put to death, he will be the second man executed in
the state this year and the 21st since Florida resumed executions
in 1979. In January, Ted Bundy was executed for killing a Lake City
schoolgirl _ the last in a string a serial killings that started in
the Pacific Northwest.
   Adams is under his fourth death warrant for the Jan. 23, 1978,
murder of Trisa Gail Thornley, a third-grader last seen on her way
home from school.
   The girl's mutilated and naked body was found in a plastic bag
March 15, 1978, by hunters in a remote area about three miles from
her home.
   An obscene phone call to the girl's home was traced to Adams'
home, and he eventually admitted picking her up. He said he recalls
that she screamed at some point, he placed his hand over her mouth
to silence her and she suffocated.
   Adams and his wife, a teacher's aide, were friends of the
victim's parents.
   He had been scheduled to die in 1984 and twice in 1986 when
three psychiatrists ruled him mentally competent to be executed.
State law requires that inmates be able to understand why they are
being punished before they can be executed.

   A chemical fire in an electronics plant
Tuesday released an acid gas, and 19 people were hospitalized,
authorities said.
   The fire that started in chemical processing equipment at
Advanced Dielectrics Inc.'s circuit board plant filled the sky with
hydrogen bromide fumes before being brought under control around
4:30 p.m., said Cathleen Shonk of the Fremont Fire Department.
   Hydrogen bromide is an acid gas that is extremely irritating to
the nose and throat when inhaled, Shonk said. The cause of the fire
was being investigated.
   Orange smoke filled the plant's halls. The fire department
evacuated about 100 employees and 225 workers from the Sequoia
Institute, a training center next door to the factory in an
industrial park.
   The 19 injured were taken to hospitals in Fremont and Hayward,
cities along the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay north of
San Jose.
   Four people were listed in stable condition at Kaiser Hospital
in Hayward. The hospital would not disclose the nature of their
injuries.
   Nine patients were taken to Washington Hospital in Fremont,
where they were given 15-minute decontamination showers and awaited
examinations for possible respiratory damage, said spokeswoman
Patricia McAuliffe.
   Six people treated at Saint Rose Hospital in Hayward for
irritation to their eyes and throat were in stable condition and
were expected to be released Tuesday evening, said spokesman Robert
Thorn.
   Another 16 people were treated at the scene for smoke
irritation, said Shonk.

   A fire that started while a tank truck was
loading gasoline destroyed a fuel storage facility and 275,000
gallons of oil, burning the vehicle's driver critically, officials
said.
   The fire sent up a column of smoke that could be seen for at
least 20 miles.
   Five hours after the blaze broke out, flames still were shooting
50 feet in the air, but fire officials said the fire was under
control and would be allowed to burn itself out overnight.
   Firefighters planned to be on the scene into the morning, said
Clarke County Fire Chief James Hansford.
   The fire at Lay's Petroleum Products, a Shell Oil Co. facility
which has four above-ground storage tanks, apparently was started
by the truck, Hansford said.
   The driver, James Coile, apparently gunned his engine several
times as he backed toward a filling area, sucking fumes into his
exhaust pipe and touching off the blaze, Hansford said.
   Coile, 48, of Danielsville was taken to St. Marys Hospital in
critical condition and airlifted to Humana Hospital in Augusta,
said a St. Marys spokesman.
   Hansford said the tank truck exploded, but all of the storage
tanks held.
   Also destroyed were a motor home, a warehouse containing 5,000
55-gallon drums of oil and the company's office building, Hansford
said.
   There was no immediate damage estimate.

   A Picasso self-portrait, a town house by Philip
Johnson and Andy Warhol's ``Shot Red Marilyn'' are among the 4,529
artworks going on the block here during a 12-day, $600 million
auction frenzy that got under way Tuesday night.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, the city's biggest auction houses,
hope to ring up $572 million in sales, and Habsburg, Feldman, a
Geneva-based auctioneer, was expecting to bring in up to $30.5
million for 57 Impressionist and modern paintings.
   ``There is a tremendous amount of interest and purchasing power
around the world,'' said John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's
North America. ``There is heavy buying from Europeans and
tremendous interest from the Far East, especially Japan. Korean
buyers are now emerging. And I would not count the Americans out,
either.''
   Sotheby's and Christie's were to auction 4,472 works, starting
with contemporary art sales this week.
   Among the paintings sold Tuesday night at Sotheby's were two
major drip paintings by Jackson Pollock: ``Number 8, 1950,'' which
went for $10.5 million, and ``Number 19, 1949,'' which fetched $3.6
million.
   The price paid for ``Number 8, 1950'' broke the record for a
Pollock painting, $5.72 million last year for ``Frieze.''
   Jeffrey Deitch, who bought ``Number 8'' for an anonymous
collector, called the price ``very advantageous ... Sometimes you
just get lucky.''
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973 and
inspired by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer,
sold for $5.7 million.
   Five sculptures by Claes Oldenburg were sold: ``Ice Cream
Sandwich,'' $370,000; ``Plate of Meat,'' $360,000; ``Bacon and
Egg,'' $450,000; ``Cheesecake from Javatime,'' $47,500; and ``Green
Beans,'' $240,000.
   Andy Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which portrays a ruby-lipped
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as first lady in 1963, sold for $750,000
_ more than twice the presale estimate.
   ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964 depiction of Marilyn Monroe, will be
offered at Christie's on Wednesday. The estimate for the signed,
synthetic polymer silkscreen on canvas is $1.5 million to $2
million.
   Other Christie's offerings include ``Colored Alphabet,'' a
12-by-10{ inch oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns, estimated at
$1.5 million. The theme ``is, in fact, the alphabet. But it's in
vivid, overlapping colors: various shades of blue, yellow and red
with some black,'' said Roberta Maneker, a Christie's spokeswoman.
   A Sotheby sale next Tuesday features Gauguin's ``Mata Mua,''
circa 1892, completed during the artist's first trip to Tahiti.
Estimated at $20 million to $25 million, it is being sold by Jaime
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, and Baron Hans
Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a member of the advisory board of
Sotheby's Holdings.
   The same day, ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait done in Paris
during the artist's ``blue period,'' is expected to command $15
million to $20 million. The seller is Wendell Cherry, president and
chief executive officer of Humana Inc., the Louisville, Ky.,
hospital management corporation.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow, is expected to fetch $1.5
million to $2.5 million.
   A Sotheby's sale of 20th century decorative arts Saturday will
include the only town house designed by architect Philip Johnson.
The two-story minimalist house was commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III. Andy Warhol called it ``the original New
York loft.'' Real estate taxes on it in 1988 came to $14,414.
   A Christie's impressionist sale on May 10 and May 11 is expected
to bring in $109 million to $149 million.
   The paintings include five Monets, including ``The Trees,
Autumn,'' estimated at $6 million to $8 million; seven Picassos; 10
Renoirs, including ``The Logue,'' ($2.5 million to $3.5 million),
which depicts a model and Renoir's brother, Edmond, a journalist,
peering through opera glasses, and four by Degas.
   The private collection of late movie producer Hal B. Wallis,
including two Monets, will be auctioned next week.
   Sotheby's is shooting for total sales of $260.9 million to
$340.8 million; Christie's aims for $169.9 million to $231.3
million.

   The government on Wednesday rejected student
protesters' demands that it recognize their new independent unions,
setting the stage for more pro-democracy demonstrations.
   On Tuesday, student leaders gave the government 24 hours to
recognize their student union or they would take to the streets
again. Thousands demonstrated for democracy and freedom in Shanghai.
   The developments added new tension to a situation the government
has been trying to calm by holding talks with officially sanctioned
student unions.
   Last week's activism crested with a march of 150,000 students
and their supporters in China's capital.
   The official student unions took no part in the marches, the
biggest in communist China's history, and student activists say the
talks won't satisfy their yearnings for a freer and more open China.
   Beijing police announced they would close central Beijing's
Tiananmen Square on Thursday, the 70th anniversary of China's first
student protests, in what appeared to be an effort to head off a
new student march.
   The government also said unidentified non-students who oppose
Communist rule have been advising the student protesters from
behind the scenes, and suggested that leading dissident Fang Lizhi
might be one of them.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu told a news conference that these
people ``try to accomplish during disturbances goals that they
cannot attain in circumstances of political stability.''
   Yuan stopped short of directly accusing Fang, an internationally
renowned astrophysicist, of advising the student protesters. But he
questioned Fang's patriotism and said, ``The role Mr. Fang wants to
play in the current disturbances will be decided by his words and
deeds.''
   Fang, who previously has called Marxism a failure and called for
multi-party democracy, has not taken part in any of the student
protests that began April 15. Speeches he made on campuses in 1986
were blamed for stirring up 1986-87 pro-democracy marches, and he
was ousted from the party.
   Yuan refused to say what the government will do if students try
to march Thursday.
   The protest in Shanghai, China's most important trading and
industrial city, began in the early afternoon when about 6,000
students, carrying banners reading ``give us democracy and
freedom,'' blocked traffic in front of city government offices.
   Student leaders presented petitions demanding political reform
and the Xinhua News Agency said the protest ended about 10 p.m.
   An American teacher said a class boycott, which started in
Beijing and spread earlier this week to Tianjin, has moved to
Shanghai. About half of the students at Fudan University, the
city's leading school, are striking, said Jason Hurtado, of
Portland, Ore.
   He quoted student activists at Fudan as saying that student
leaders from Beijing helped organize the strike and the march.
Student leaders have also been sent to Beijing for more
coordination, he said. Earlier, students from Tianjin came to
Beijing for guidance with their movement.
   In Beijing, 65 student leaders from 33 universities bicycled
more than 7{ miles to deliver an ultimatum to the National People's
Congress, China's legislature; the State Council, its cabinet; and
the Central Committee of the ruling Communist Party.
   In a handwritten letter, the students demanded the government
recognize and hold talks with the United Association of Beijing
Universities, an independent association set up during their
2-week-old campaign for democratic reform. They want a free press,
freedom of assembly and publication and an end to official
corruption.
   Thursday marks the 70th anniversary of China's first student
demonstration, which turned into a movement for democratic and
scientific reforms.
   Beijing students already have marched five times to Tiananmen
Square since April 17, defying police warnings. An estimated 70,000
students at 41 colleges in Beijing also have been boycotting class
since April 24.
   After a march April 27 drew cheers and applause from tens of
thousands of bystanders, the government held a series of meetings
with invited students.
   However, most of those invited have been members of the
officially established student unions. The government has declared
the students' new association illegal.
   For its part the association has rejected the talks with the
government as a sham, accusing officials of trying to placate
students without agreeing to democratic reforms.
   Despite student complaints, however, the government does seem to
be responding to public pressure.
   On Saturday, Sunday and Monday, ministers of three government
bureaus along with the government's leading spokesman and the mayor
and party secretary of Beijing met with students.
   The meetings were unprecedented in a society whose leaders hide
from public scrutiny.
   The state-run press has softened its shrill editorial stance on
the movement and several in-depth reports on the talks and the
demonstrations have appeared.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Behind the red door on Makhoul Street in west
Beirut, there's a watering hole where the regulars huddle to share
a drink, seek shelter from the shelling, and maybe sing along to a
Sinatra tune. Here's what the ``war clientele'' were up to on a
recent night:

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunched over a beer in the Backstreet
Bar, the only tavern in west Beirut that has stayed open throughout
the Lebanon fighting, a doctor was decribing the horrors of the
casualty ward after recent ferocious shelling.
   Around the Lebanese doctor, a veteran of more bad nights than he
can recall in Lebanon's relentless bloodletting, the tavern was
filled with about 40 people drinking from Habib Ne'aimeh's
well-stocked bar during a lull in the shelling.
   Ne'aimeh has kept his bar open six nights a week during the
fighting.
   ``When the shelling gets heavy I turn up the music,'' he said,
standing behind his red and black bar on a recent night. ``These
people are not as relaxed as they try to appear. They're drinking
more.''
   The doctor works at the American University Hospital, once one
of the best medical centers in the Middle East. Now, after 14 years
of civil war, it's short of medicine and trained staff. It has
taken several direct hits in recent fighting.
   ``One night 15 people were brought in,'' he said, clutching his
beer tightly. ``Four of them were dead.
   ``There was a baby. We thought its mother was among the dead and
we didn't know what to do with it,'' said the doctor.
   ``Suddenly, this woman appears out of nowhere as one of our
people is trying to soothe the baby. Turns out it's the mother.''
   That story had a happy ending. But for thousands of other
Lebanese, the last seven weeks have brought only death, injury,
devastation or confinement in bunkers and basements.
   Nearly 300 people have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded
since March 8 in almost non-stop battles between army commander
Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian forces and an alliance of
Syrian troops and Druse Moslem militiamen.
   Ne'aimeh's coterie of customers, what he calls his ``war
clientele,'' regularly make it to the Backstreet through the
darkened alleys, past packs of dogs scavenging through rotting,
rat-infested garbage, to the red door in Makhoul Street.
   Shortages have forced Ne'aimeh to trim his menu to cold cuts,
cheeses and grilled steaks.
   His customers, flung together by the war, are a bizarre group of
people who for their own reasons have hung on in the Lebanese chaos
and the kidnappings.
   As more than 150,000 people have fled the city amid the carnage
in recent weeks, the Backstreet has become an oasis for this
disparate group.
   There are Swiss from the Red Cross, Spanish and Belgians from
the French-based Medecins Sans Frontiers agency, a couple of
Russians, the odd Bulgarian or two and some Lebanese.
   Ne'aimeh is a Greek Orthodox Christian, one of several thousand
who live in the Moslem sector. Most are leftists, with little in
common with the Maronite Catholics, who make up the vast majority
of the Christians trapped in their enclave in east Beirut and the
mountains and coastal strip running north.
   His only waiter is a Sunni Moslem _ the others refuse to leave
their underground shelters to go to work _ and the cook's a Shiite
Moslem.
   Despite their different religious preferences, they're a tight
team, a microcosm of what's possible in Lebanon if the warring
sects and factions could only get their act together.
   This night at the bar, everyone's having a good time, letting it
all out. But there's an undercurrent of apprehension. The laughter
sometimes has a brittle edge to it.
   Everyone knows someone who's been killed or wounded or lost a
relative, or whose home has been hit in the bombardments. They've
all wondered whether the next rocket or shell to fall will have
their name on it. Most are skeptical things will get better, and
many are trying to leave Lebanon.
   As the sound system belted out Frank Sinatra singing ``New York,
New York,'' everyone joined in the line ``I want to wake up in a
city that never sleeps'' _ enjoying the irony that the shelling
makes sleep a luxury few get in Beirut. At that moment, the bar's
generator sputtered and gave out.
   About 11 p.m., rockets began to arc across Beirut's dividing
Green Line, three miles of unrelieved devastation, where Christians
and Moslems have faced each other from sandbagged positions and
gutter apartment buildings for 14 years.
   ``Incoming or outgoing?'' a young woman asked as an explosion
thundered nearby.
   ``Incoming, I think. I saw the flash,'' a young man answered
hesitantly.
   ``Anybody got a radio?'' someone said. ``What's it say?''
   A Lebanese reporter working for a Western news organization
tuned his transistor radio to the Christian-run Voice of Lebanon.
   ``Shells hitting the Christian side,'' the reporter said. ``It's
outgoing.''
   ``That's OK then,'' the young man replied.
   Then the radio said the source of the shelling had been
pinpointed to west Beirut. The young man lost his poise, told
Ne'aimeh he'd pay his tab later, and left.
   He knew the Christian army gunners were probably at that moment
training their 155mm howitzers on the area around the Backstreet
Bar to retaliate.

<HEAD>Iran Buys New Weapons, Rebuilds Battered Military</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

   Despite severe economic problems, Iran is
spending up to $5 billion a year to rebuild its military now that a
cease-fire has been reached in the 8-year-old war with Iraq,
analysts report.
   Iran's relations with Moscow also are warming and the
fundamentalist Moslem regime is turning to the Soviet bloc
increasingly for arms, apparently paying for tanks, artillery and
other weapons with crude oil.
   On Monday, Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said
Iran soon would buy weapons from the Soviet Union and was
negotiating with countries he did not identify for advanced fighter
bombers.
   Iran must broaden its source of arms, he said, because ``if we
depend on one particular country or bloc, then they take advantage
of the situation. ... They want to impose their own ideology on
us.''
   Besharati did not say what kind of Soviet weapons Iran would buy
or what the cost would be.
   ``Strengthening the Islamic Republic's defense capabilities is
one of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period,''
President Ali Khamenei told senior military commanders at a recent
conference.
   Both belligerents have large forces along the cease-fire line
and, with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began,
Iran's rapid buildup is causing concern among Western officials.
   ``It's very worrisome. They're rebuilding much faster than we
expected,'' a senior official of the U.S. Defense Department told
The Associated Press, on condition of anonymity.
   Iraq also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces,
and both countries have been developing their own arms industries,
including missile production, since the cease-fire Aug. 20.
   Earlier this month, the Tehran daily Payam e-Enqelab said the
missile firepower of the Revolutionary Guards Corps will ``increase
five-fold in the near future'' using domestically produced weapons
with ranges of up to 100 miles.
   The American source said of the Iranian rearmament program: ``It
appears they're talking in the range of $20 billion over the next
4-5 years. They've got serious economic problems and yet they're
spending this kind of money on rebuilding their military. The
question is: to what end?''
   U.S. and other Western officials said Iran's major arms
suppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war, China and North
Korea, still are its main sources.
   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf region reported recently
that the Chinese are helping Iran build a plant to produce
surface-to-surface missiles.
   Al-Ittihad, a daily in Abu Dhabi, quoted military sources last
month as saying China would provide 40 new Silkworm anti-ship
missiles, a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of HQ-2J
surface-to-air missiles, the Chinese version of the Soviet SAM-2.
   Evidence increases, however, that Iran also is turning to
Eastern Europe for Soviet-designed weapons. U.S. sources said most
of the equipment is tanks, trucks, artillery and small arms rather
than high-technology weapons.
   Gulf newspapers have said Romania would supply nearly 500 tanks,
armored vehicles and tank transporters; help build a naval base on
Qeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz, and convert a tractor factory
in Arak to produce armored vehicles.
   Czechoslovakia will supply Iran with 180 T-54 and T-55 tanks and
help build a plant to make anti-tank weapons, the papers have
reported.
   No independent confirmation of the reports was available, but
Iran has made trade agreements with several Soviet bloc states,
including Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, providing for
payment in crude oil.
   It has a similar pact with Brazil, now the world's sixth largest
arms exporter.
   Iran's official media, monitored in Nicosia, said only that the
deals involve ``products and services,'' but analysts believe arms
are involved.
   ``The East bloc will be swimming with T-54s and T-55s because of
East-West force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that Iran
would be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter,'' said
Hans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist with the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
   In the U.S. source's view, arms deals with the Soviet bloc
``have obvious advantages, including all-land transportation
through Russia,'' Iran's northern neighbor.
   Tehran also has strengthened military links with its eastern
neighbor Pakistan, a Moslem nation. The Pakistanis are developing
their own arms industry and are advanced in the production of
missiles and some other high-tech weapons.
   Both Brig. Gen. Mansour Sattari, the air force commander, and
Ali Shamkhani, the Revolutionary Guards Corps minister, visited
Islamabad in recent weeks to meet with senior Pakistani military
officials.
   ``We'll soon see the fruits of these talks, which have defense
and other objectives,'' Shamkhani said without elaboration.
   Official Iranian media have reported a defense allocation
equivalent to $5.85 billion in this year's budget, described as
about half last year's total.
   Reselat, a Tehran daily, said Parliament also approved a secret
budget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher.
   Exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of the
secret budget. They said it included $4.9 billion for the Defense
Ministry and $3.6 billion for Revolutionary Guards.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, based in Iraq, also told The Associated
Press those figures did not represent Iran's ``entire planned
military spending,''
   Analysts have estimated that, on the basis of such needs as
combat jets, tanks, radars and missiles, Iran would spend about $5
billion a year on new weapons.

<HEAD>Israeli Children Play At The Uprising On Computer Screens</HEAD>

   The Palestinian uprising has produced a new
game that has Israelis battling stone-throwing Palestinians on
computer screens and getting burned _ either by firebombs or world
public opinion.
   Computer buff Shahar Melamed said the game is being passed
around by computer enthusiasts and is popular among children in
Rehovot, a town near Tel Aviv housing Israel's prestigious Weizman
Institute of Science.
   Melamed is a photo editor at the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot,
which printed a story on the game Tuesday.
   He said the program was signed only by ``Mike'' and added:
``Some details of the program indicate it was done in the United
States ... I don't know who wrote the program but he seems to be a
very good programmer.''
   The game is titled ``The Intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for
``uprising'' that is commonly used for the nearly 17-month revolt
against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Palestinian children have made up their own street game on the
uprising in which they take turns playing soldiers and
stone-throwers, shoot with plastic guns and even hold mock funerals
for ``martyrs.''
   ``The Intefadeh'' is much more sophisticated, with players
getting points for inflicting casualties _ but only with specific
weapons allowed by changing rules.
   These mirror real life, since Israeli soldiers face a complex
set of regulations on using tear gas, rubber or plastic bullets and
live ammunition in putting down riots in the occupied lands.
   The game has political implications. Players gain points for
helping to elect right-wing politicans. Players can lose points for
upsetting world public opinion, again reflecting reality. Israel
has drawn international criticism over the more than 450
Palestinian deaths in the revolt.
   One set of instructions for the game begins:
   ``You can use the wooden club you were issued on any rioter. Use
tear gas any time you feel it is needed. You are authorized to
shoot any rioter with rubber bullets. Shoot rubber or plastic
bullets at any rioter who throws Molotov cocktail. You are not
allowed to use live ammunition under any circumstances.''
   The screen then shows a typical street in a Palestinian village
or town, with a lone Israeli soldier facing protesters. The trooper
is pelted with rocks and firebombs and may respond with gunfire or
chase the protesters along narrow ``streets.''
   But the rules can change according to who is the ``defense
minister in charge,'' randomly chosen by the computer and listed at
the top of the screen.
   Under Moshe Arens, Israel's real-life foreign minister, live
ammunition cannot be used. But under Ariel Sharon _ a hawk forced
to resign as defense minister in 1983 during Israel's invasion of
Lebanon _ live ammunition is a must.
   Points are scored by inflicting as many casualties as possible
within a given time limit by using proper ammunition.
   An injured soldier is evacuated by an ambulance or bursts into
flames and is declared dead. The computer labels him ``just another
victim of Arab terrorism.''
   Palestinians injured by tear gas move in dizzy circles, but
intensify stone-throwing attacks later.
   At the end of the game, an ``Israeli Defense Forces evaluation
form'' is displayed on the screen, featuring the number of
protesters injured, killed or captured. A successful player is
congratulated for helping Israeli right-wingers win the national
elections.
   The game is made even more complex, however, by the presence of
the ``public opinion index.'' Indiscriminate shooting of protesters
can lead to a chilling judgment on the screen. One example:
   ``Performance: You have gone wild. Public opinion index: zero.
Your inefficiency in supressing the violence is appalling. You must
be sleeping on the job. The government lost the elections mostly as
a result of your inaction.''

   SIRISIAR BRIDGE, On the Indian-Nepalese Border (AP) _ A friendly
sort of friction has set in at this crossing point between India,
the political and military giant of South Asia, and Nepal, a tiny
and landlocked kingdom.
   For more than a month, Nepal has been defying and exasperating
India by refusing to renegotiate trade agreements on India's terms.
   As a result, India has imposed a partial blockade and Nepal is
suffering severe shortages of fuel needed to operate motor
vehicles, provide electrical power and cook food.
   Medicines, baby food and other essential goods also are in short
supply.
   The problem is as tangled as the traffic jam of bullock carts,
horse-drawn carriages and bicycle-powered rickshaws trying to
negotiate the narrow wooden bridge over the Sirisiar River without
getting stuck in the cracks between the creaking planks.
   The bullocks' long, pointed horns scrape and snag on the
rickshaws' cloth canopies, much as the government officials in New
Delhi and Katmandu are scraping and snagging in the political
impasse.
   India, population 880 million, perceives Nepal as an ungrateful
neighbor, seeking preferential treatment for itself while refusing
to grant India reciprocal privileges.
   Nepal, population 17 million, sees India as a bit of a bully,
trying to thwart Nepalese efforts to diversify its trading partners.
   Officially speaking, the Indian blockade is not total.
Practically speaking, its effects come close to being total.
   ``This is not a blockade. You can see the trucks are moving,''
customs collector Asit Mitra said in the Indian border town of
Raxaul as a score of vehicles lumbered over the bridge to Nepal,
hauling burlap bags of salt, cases of baby formula and brand new _
but empty _ tanks for cooking gas.
   ``The goods are coming in, but not as they were,'' said Mayor
Vimal Srivastav, three miles up the road in the Nepalese town of
Birganj.
   At the Birganj customs yard, the goods are unloaded from Indian
trucks. But the porters are sleeping in the midday heat atop the
cartons they normally would be transferring to Nepalese trucks.
   The diesel and gasoline to run the trucks 75 miles north to
Katmandu, the Nepalese capital, no longer arrive from India, itself
a net importer of petroleum products.
   ``It's like you get the torch (flashlight), but not the
battery,'' said Pashupati Shaha, a hotel owner in Birganj.
   When the bilateral trade and transit treaties expired March 23
with no replacements in the offing, India closed 13 of the 15
official crossing points on the 1,095-mile border. Only Raxaul and
Jogbani remain open.
   Nepal wanted to renegotiate the two treaties separately, one
governing trade with India, the other covering vital transit rights
from Calcutta to the border for non-Indian imports. India sought a
single treaty to safeguard its own trade with Nepal.
   Nepal has little to offer foreign trading partners, apart from
goatskins and a few spices. But it imports machinery, housewares,
textiles and food in addition to pharmaceutical and petroleum
products.
   For the last two years, about 40 percent of Nepal's imports were
Indian. Fifteen years ago, more than 80 percent were Indian.
   Especially of concern to India are recent Nepalese efforts to
expand trade with China, India's longtime regional rival and the
only other country with direct land access to Nepal.
   India's pique heightened last fall when Nepal purchased
anti-aircraft guns and other weapons from China, prompting two
questions in New Delhi: Why was Nepal making purchases from China,
and why did the tiny Himalayan monarchy, which has about 35,000 men
under arms compared to India's 1.4 million, need anti-aircraft
guns, anyway?
   Nepal considers its trade and defense needs its own business.
   ``Trade has its own nature,'' Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar
Upadhyaya told a reporter in Katmandu this week. ``Trade will
increase normally with any country with which we receive a fair
deal.''
   One more nettle is Nepal's decision requiring the 150,000
Indians in Nepal to obtain work permits, while India has made no
similar requirements of the estimated 5 million Nepalese in India.
   In addition, Birganj had long been a shopper's delight for
Indians, whose own country prides itself on self-sufficiency and
imports little of the Western and Japanese goods widely available
in Nepal.
   The Nepalese joke about their ability to sell just about
anything with a foreign label to Indian visitors.
   Shaha, the Birganj hotel owner, remarked, ``You can blame Nepal
for this. The Indians can find some of these things cheaper in
Calcutta and Madras, but they want to come to Nepal and buy. Some
merchants import saris from India, stamp `Made in Japan' on them,
and the Indians are very happy to buy.''
   ``The Nepalese will buy seven or eight times what they need of
something, import it through Calcutta, then smuggle it back across
the border to sell it in India,'' an Indian government official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   The surprise declaration by Sudanese rebels
of a monthlong cease-fire reprieves the Khartoum government's
beleaguered troops and boosts an international effort to save
100,000 people facing starvation.
   It also raises hopes for an end to six years of civil war that
drains $1 million a day from the coffers of one of the world's
poorest countries.
   Monday's announcement by John Garang, leader of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, comes at the height of his greatest
success of the war _ a six-month string of victories that has
government forces reeling.
   Rebel fighters also have been intensifying pressure on the
strategic southern capital, Juba. Its fall could have determined
the war's outcome by forcing the government from its largest
stronghold in the embattled south.
   But at least as important, the cease-fire could boost the United
Nations' struggling operation to transport more than 100,000 tons
of food and supplies to the south before heavy rains start this
month.
   Last year, relief officials say up to 500,000 southerners died
in the fighting or from war-induced disease and famine in villages
isolated by flooded roads and airstrips.
   Garang, a U.S.-educated renegade army colonel, said the
unilateral truce will hold only so long as the government refrains
from redeploying or reinforcing its troops. He said it could be
extended.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi welcomed the move. ``Each step taken
by Garang toward peace will be reciprocated by two steps from the
government,'' he said in a May Day speech.
   Only last month, Garang rejected a U.N.-proposed ``month of
tranquillity'' to allow the $132 million relief operation easy
access to 2.3 million war-affected southerners.
   Instead, he guaranteed safe conduct for specific relief convoys.
But attacks by unidentified armed groups, bureaucratic hassles,
inadequate transport infrastructure and bad planning have hampered
the operation. Only 37,000 tons of food was delivered in April.
   U.N. officials say they will continue until the rains cut
transport routes.
   ``I think the overriding reasons behind this decision are
political, but they are bound to be connected with the relief
effort,'' said Richard Reid, the regional director of UNICEF who
conducts most U.N. negotiations with the rebels.
   ``We're keeping our fingers crossed, but it ought to help the
operation if only by easing things and reducing the level of
anxiety,'' Reid said in a telephone interview from Amman, Jordan.
   Military experts in Khartoum interpreted the rebels' rejection
of the original truce as evidence of unwillingness to impede their
battlefield winning streak.
   Since then, Mahdi has come under army pressure and approved a
tentative peace plan, which the rebels welcomed with cautious
optimism.
   The cease-fire ``was the next logical step in the peace
process,'' said Peter Woodward, a lecturer at England's Reading
University and a specialist on Sudan who returned from Khartoum
last week.
   ``Now it's up to the government to arrange for further steps,''
Woodward said in a telephone interview.
   Garang's broadcast said all his forces will remain in their
positions ``to wait for the government to implement the
requirements of the Sudanese peace initiative.''
   A joint technical military committee then would work out a
comprehensive cease-fire, he said.
   The agreement's most politically sensitive clause calls for the
suspension of harsh Islamic laws in force since late 1983. The
mainly animist and Christian rebels took up arms against the
Moslem-dominated government a few months earlier, demanding
autonomy for the south.
   Mahdi, the leader of a Sudanese Moslem sect, approved the
suspension last month, leaving the way clear for a constitutional
conference.
   In the two years that the rebels have won an upper hand in the
war, southern civilians have suffered as both sides used food as a
weapon.
   Juba, a city of dusty streets and thatched-roof mud huts whose
population is swollen by refugees to five times its normal 30,000,
has been besieged for more than two years. Rebels intensified their
attacks these past few months.
   ``The SPLA's military successes created a very difficult
political situation for them,'' said Woodward. ``If they took over
the major towns in the south ... it would mean a de facto
separation of Sudan, and it would be much more difficult to try and
negotiate a peaceful settlement for a united Sudan. Now, they
negotiate from a position of strength.''
   Military sources in Khartoum say about 20,000 troops are holed
up in the middle of Juba.
   One source estimated the army's strength at 75,000 and the
rebels at 57,000. But government troops are outnumbered in the war
because only 10,000 soldiers remain in major southern towns other
than Juba.

   When Mayor Tom Bradley won a fifth term three
weeks ago, it should have been a time of celebration for the
71-year-old sharecropper's son. Instead, he found himself facing
what's become the political crisis of his career.
   After 16 years of an administration free of personal scandal,
the usually bland and steady Bradley is the subject of a
conflict-of-interest probe for accepting thousands of dollars in
consulting fees from banks that did business with the city.
   He says he was unaware of the business ties when he accepted the
money.
   Bradley also is under fire because his daughter was employed by
a project to which he helped funnel nearly $400,000 of city money,
the Task Force for Africa-Los Angeles Relations. He said he was
unaware she had been hired.
   The allegations, which began surfacing at the end of the
campaign, have tarnished the nice-guy image of Bradley, a former
police lieutenant dubbed the Teflon Mayor for his ability to escape
blame for the city's gang, growth and pollution problems.
   Other mayors have had bigger problems. Political allies of New
York's Ed Koch have committed suicide or gone to prison. San
Antonio's Henry Cisneros admitted a close personal relationship
with a woman not his wife. Detroit's Coleman Young has been slapped
with a paternity suit by a former city employee.
   But for Bradley, probably the blandest of big-city mayors, it's
a major embarrassment.
   For politically dull Los Angeles it's a rare taste of a scandal
at the very top.
   Bradley has scrambled to defuse the controversy by placing his
investments _ which range from an estimated $101,000 to $1 million
_ in a blind trust.
   He has established an ethics panel _ which announced Monday it
won't investigate Bradley and will instead rewrite the city ethics
code to restore public trust in city government.
   Bradley also has retained lawyers from Manatt, Phelps,
Rothenberg and Phillips, a law firm of Democratic political
insiders that is handling the ethics defense of House Speaker Jim
Wright.
   He is refusing comment until a city investigation is completed.
But allegations surface daily.
   On Tuesday, the Herald Examiner reported that Far East National
Bank was allowed to hold $600,000 in city money for three months in
1987 without paying interest. It said the account was set up by
Bradley. Two months after the situation was discovered, Bradley
started earning $18,000 a year as a consultant to the bank. He has
since returned the money, saying he was unaware Far East had
business ties with the city.
   Bradley, the city's first black mayor, won a fifth term April
11, barely escaping a runoff with challenger Nate Holden and
drawing the lowest turnout in decades.
   ``Unquestionably the issues that have been raised over the
course of the last three weeks have raised some doubts in the minds
of some people,'' Bradley said.
   Supporters predict, however, he will survive the controversy.
   ``He's a super-quality guy. He has never done anything the least
bit questionable on anything,'' said Richard Riordan, president of
the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission and a Republican who supports
the Democratic Bradley.
   ``He's so perfect that people want to knock him off his hill and
find his imperfections,'' he added.
   Holden, who made headlines by buying back semi-automatic weapons
from the public, said: ``I think the quicker we get to the bottom
of this matter the better everything's going to be. Business at
City Hall is stopped. It's at a standstill.''
   In addition to examining Bradley's relationships with Far East
and the African task force, investigators are focusing on Valley
Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association. Bradley was paid at least
$71,000 to serve on its board while it did business with the city.
He resigned the post the day after his election.

<HEAD>Bionic Duo Win Battle of Sunday Movies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC's bionic reunion garnered some bionic
ratings, outrunning ABC's critically praised ``My Name is Bill W.''
and the first installment of CBS' two-part Oliver North saga.
   The Sunday showdown was the first big movie faceoff of the May
sweeps, one of four months when network affiliates' local ratings
are measured to determine advertising rates.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co., NBC's ``Bionic Showdown: The
Return of the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Woman II''
ranked 11th among prime-time shows for the week, with a rating of
17.6 and a 28 share.
   ABC's ``My Name is Bill W.,'' the story of the founder of
Alcoholics Anonymous, had a 15.2 and 24 and ranked 24th. ``Guts &amp;
Glory: The Rise and Fall of Oliver North'' got a 14.0 and a 23
share to rank 31st.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 million homes
with television. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   ABC's ``Roseanne,'' even though a repeat, edged a new episode of
NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' for first place. ``Cosby'' had a slightly
lower rating, but a higher share. That apparently was due to
daylight-saving time's disadvantage for earlier shows. There are
fewer viewers in front of the set at 8 p.m. EDT when ``Cosby'' is
broadcast. ``Roseanne'' is on at 9 p.m.
   The rest of the top 10 last week were: ``Cheers'' NBC; ``A
Different World'' NBC; ``Murder, She Wrote'' CBS; ``Golden Girls''
NBC; ``Dear John'' NBC; ``L.A. Law'' NBC; ``The Wonder Years'' ABC;
and ``Empty Nest'' ABC.
   NBC racked up its 45th weekly victory in a row, with an average
rating of 13.7 to CBS' 11.7 and ABC's 11.4.
   The ``CBS Evening News'' tied ``ABC World News Tonight'' in news
ratings, each getting a 9.8 rating and 21 share. ``NBC Nightly
News'' had an 8.7 rating and 19 share.

   Educators hope a new program will make a
middle school a model for race relations and improved academics.
   The restructured school _ to be called the Prospect Middle
School Center for Multiracial, Multicultural and Multiethnic
Education _ is to offer programs to encourage students to respect
other races and teach staff members how to instruct students of
other races, officials said Tuesday.
   ``Perhaps it will improve race relations throughout the entire
city,'' said Principal Robert Pipkin.
   ``It will be the model where we develop programs, policies and
practices for district-wide use,'' Pittsburgh School District
spokeswoman Pat Crawford said.
   Ms. Crawford said no new students or staff members would be
added to the present Prospect Middle School in the city's Mount
Washington neighborhood. She said the new programs are to begin
next fall.
   School Superintendent Richard C. Wallace said the idea came from
principals and consultants who studied city schools last fall.
   He said concerns about racism stemmed from occasional fights in
schools and the disproportionate number of black students who are
suspended or referred to special education classes.
   ``I wouldn't say it's at this point a serious problem, a crisis
situation, but we don't want it to get to that level,'' Wallace
said.
   Of about 39,600 public school students in Pittsburgh, 52 percent
are black and 48 percent are white, officials said.

   The old Chinese habit of shunning banks has
caused an 82-year-old farmer to lose most of his life savings to
mildew, an official newspaper reported today.
   When Zhang Dexiang, who had buried his life savings of about
$1,200 in his courtyard five years ago, dug up the money recently
he discovered it was moldy ``almost beyond recognition,'' the China
Daily reported.
   The farmer in northeastern Liaoning province was only able to
salvage $400, which he exchanged for new bills at a local bank, it
said.
   China, which has a surplus of cash in its overheated economy, is
suffering from a shortage of funds for investment because many
people, fearing runaway inflation, traditionally refuse to put
their money in the bank.
   Personal caches like Zhang's account for an estimated $133
billion.
   The interest rate on one-year deposits was raised last year from
7.2 percent to 8.64 percent, but fails to keep pace with 36 percent
inflation.

   Some of the state's poor opened their monthly
benefit checks this week and got a surprise _ an extra check.
   But they can't cash in on the windfall because the extra checks
belong to another recipient of the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program. The program sends out 23,000 checks totaling $4.5
million a month.
   The problem likely was caused by a mail-sorting machine at a
company that has the contract for sorting mail and stuffing
envelopes for the program, said Kenny Whitlock, who directs the
Department of Human Services division that administers the program.
   If the suction cups of the mail-sorting machine come down on
computer holes on the checks, the suction picks up not only the
intended check but also the one behind it, Whitlock said.
   The problem has surfaced in at least six counties, but may be
more widespread, said Whitlock.

   Student protests from Massachusetts to California took aim
Tuesday at proposed budget cuts, tuition increases and union
recognition, and student pressure at a prestigious college led to a
ban on Coca-Cola products.
   In New York, thousands of protesting City University students
skipped classes and marched through lower Manhattan as a deadline
approached on a state spending bill that would reduce money for
higher education and force a tuition increase. Hours later, Gov.
Mario Cuomo vetoed the tuition hike.
   In South Hadley, Mass., Mount Holyoke College administrators,
under pressure from students to boycott Coca-Cola products because
of the company's ties to South Africa, announced a monthlong ban of
the company's soft drinks.
   In the central Massachusetts town of Granby, nearly 400 students
walked out of high school and into a heavy rain to protest budget
cuts the principal says could cost the school at least three
teachers and several programs.
   In Atlanta, students and others who met to discuss a decision to
ban a rap music concert Friday at Morris Brown College were
released without bond Tuesday after a hearing on felony trespassing
charges.
   Twenty-seven people, including students from several Atlanta
University Center colleges and some non-students, were arrested
Monday for refusing to leave a student center, said Cynthia Bell, a
Morris Brown College spokeswoman.
   At the University of California at Berkeley, teaching and
research assistants on Wednesday were to begin a two-day walkout
and picket the four major campus entrances to protest the school's
refusal to recognize their union.
   In New York, about 4,000 students stepped up protests that began
last week.
   Placard-carrying, chanting students from the university system
assembled in front of the World Trade Center, where Cuomo's New
York office is located. They blocked traffic for several hours,
then paraded through the streets past City Hall to the Wall Street
financial district.
   ``It's not just a matter of this tuition hike. If we let them
go, it will be more,'' said Armando Howard, a 29-year-old physics
student at Hunter College. ``It will cut out the opportunity for
people to rise.''
   Cuomo, who had until midnight to sign or veto the tuition
increase measure, had given no indication what his decision would
be. But one hour before the deadline, it was announced he had
vetoed the legislation, saying university officials hadn't proven
the need for the extra money.
   At Mount Holyoke, officials outlined immediate steps to replace
Coke USA products with beverages from companies with little or no
business interest in South Africa. The announcement came in a
one-page release that gave no explanation for the move.
   Students at Mount Holyoke and several other colleges in western
Massachusetts have pressed administrators for two months to remove
Coca-Cola products because, they say, the company is reaping
profits that benefit racially segregated South Africa.
   ``I think it's a monumental step. I think it shows some
responsibility on the part of the adminstration in terms of
listening to students,'' said Kuhusu Wanzu, a member of the Coke
Campaign at the American Friends Service Committee in Atlanta,
which organized the campus boycotts.
   In Granby, students who comprise virtually the entire population
of the little school stood for 45 minutes in heavy rain before
returning to class, said Principal John Cullinan.
   ``The students felt this was the only way they could get their
message across in a way that people would notice,'' the principal
of the Granby Junior-Senior High said.
   At Berkeley, neither the 3,200-member Association of Graduate
Student Employees nor university officials would predict how many
assistants would join the walkout.
   ``So far, our indications are that this could be more symbolic
than a significant disruption,'' said university spokesman Tom
Debley.
   The dispute is over the university's view that the assistants'
work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwined
with educational experience, said Debley. Assistants receive annual
stipends from the university or research institutions averaging
about $10,000.
   The association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as a
union, but the Public Employement Relations Board recently ruled
students do not have to be considered employees for the purposes of
collective bargaining. The association is appealing the decision.

   Say bye-bye to Bill The Cat, the drug-addled
feline who's smooched Jeane Kirkpatrick and swapped brains with
Donald Trump. Bill and the other residents of ``Bloom County'' are
soon to be history, the latest victims of funny-page flameout.
   Cartoonist Berke Breathed pulled the plug on the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Bloom County'' earlier this week, becoming the
third comic-page fixture to leave fans hanging in recent years.
   But while Garry Trudeau and Gary Larson put their characters on
vacation when cartooning became a grind, Breathed opted to off his.
   ``A good comic strip is no more eternal than a ripe melon. The
ugly truth is that in most cases, comics age less gracefully than
their creators. `Bloom County' is retiring before the stretch marks
show,'' Breathed said in explaining his decision.
   Readers of nearly 800 newspapers now will learn to live without
big-beaked penguin Opus, his buddy Milo and motley party animal
Bill The Cat; no longer will their lives intersect those of
Kirkpatrick, Trump or Lee Iacocca _ three public figures frequently
skewered by Breathed.
   But such bad news is becoming all too common for the discerning
comic reader, who in the recent years has lost Larson's ``The Far
Side'' and Trudeau's ``Doonesbury'' for extended periods while
their creators escaped the day-to-day drudgery.
   ``I need a breather. Investigative cartooning is a young man's
game,'' said Trudeau in announcing his hiatus from January 1983 to
September 1984 _ a move that was questioned by veteran cartoonists
such as Milton Caniff of ``Steve Canyon.''
   ``Another guy is waiting in the wings, and once you're out you
often can't get back in _ the space is filled,'' said Caniff, who
has since died.
   Similarly, Larson's syndicate editor, Lee Salem, explained the
cartoonist ``felt he needed to get away from the deadline situation
for a while so he could try to regenerate his cells.'' ``The Far
Side'' is due back in 1990.
   While Trudeau and Larson took breathers to escape burnout,
Breathed will resume his career with an entirely new Sundays-only
strip.
   Others in the business say they understand his decision; penning
a daily strip is anything but a million laughs for its creator.
   ``It's like pedaling a bicycle above a rotating blade, knowing
that if you stop you'll fall and get cut up,'' said ``Peanuts''
cartoonist Charles Schulz, whose strip is in its fourth decade.
   ``You can't plan like a novelist, where you have three or four
years to work,'' said Schulz. ``A cartoonist doesn't have time to
stop. It's go, go, go continuously.''
   Breathed's strip says sayonara Aug. 6, although there is hope
that one resident of ``Bloom County'' _ nobody's saying which one _
may survive its doomsday.
   The cartoonist's new characters will not resemble the old ones
``with maybe one exception,'' said William Dickinson, general
manager and editorial director of The Washington Post Writers
Group, which syndicates the strip.
   Opus, anyone?

<TEXT>
   Nevadans voted 3-1 Tuesday to approve a
$52 million mining tax hike, but balloting was close on a plan to
double the money Nevada can borrow for new state construction.
   With 25 percent of 609 precincts counted, the mining tax
proposal was favored 26,692-7,966. The vote on the construction
measure was 18,363 for and 17,051 against.
   Election officials around the state predicted low voter
turnouts, ranging from 30 to 40 percent of the more than 383,000
people eligible to vote.
   ``It's nothing great but it's steady,'' Carson City
Clerk-Recorder Alan Glover said of early voter turnout, which he
estimated at about 30 percent.
   Recent polls indicated the mining tax would win approval. Gov.
Bob Miller and key lawmakers warned that without approval of the
plan, the state would face fiscal chaos.
   Had the measure lost, officials said, the Legislature would be
in session an extra month slashing budgets and raising taxes to
make up for the loss of the anticipated mining tax revenues,
expected to be $52 million over a two-year period.
   The law would allow the state to impose a 5 percent tax on the
net proceeds of mines. The ballot question was the result of an
agreement struck during the 1987 Legislature between the mining
industry, lawmakers and then-Gov. Dick Bryan.
   The other question on the ballot would double the money Nevada
can borrow for new state construction. The governor's proposed
budget includes money generated by state bond sales for new prison
and university construction projects.
   Officials have argued that without doubling the constitutional
limit on bond debt to 2 percent of the assessed value of all
taxable land, Nevada will have to pay cash for such projects.
   But opponents argue that while Nevada needs the bond money,
lawmakers who wrote supporting and opposing arguments for the
proposal intentionally neglected to mention that the state must
repay new bond sales through higher property taxes.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of dead birds, snared in a giant
glob of sticky oil, line a beach 300 miles southwest of Valdez,
victims of the spreading crude that has devastated Alaska's coast
for weeks.
   While enviromentalists, government and Exxon officials trade
barbs over blame, the oil drifts inexorably, fouling the shoreline
and leaving dead, dying or dirtied birds, fish, otters, seals and
sea lions. Even Alaska's lumbering, powerful brown bears have been
seen prowling on oil-caked beaches.
   The oil is selective: It leap-frogs large stretches of coast,
then hits others with contamination ranging from a light film to
ankle-deep goo.
   ``We landed along a wide tidal basin, about six miles of
beach,'' said Ray Bane, superintendent of Katmai National Park.
``We found oil debris in large quantities throughout the tidal
zone. We saw 2,000 to 3,000 dead birds. ... You can't really tell
what they are. They're one big blob of oil.''
   Since March 24, when the tanker Exxon Valdez smashed into Bligh
Reef in Prince William Sound and leaked 10.1 million gallons of
crude through its shattered hull, the reports of destroyed wildlife
have multiplied steadily.
   The spill has reached Chignik, 525 miles southwest of Valdez,
and residents there are fearful the oil may interfere with their
salmon season, which begins next week.
   ``What we found, say in every 100-foot distance, was four to
eight dead murres on the average,'' Bane said of the sea birds.
``We also saw fresh bear tracks going back into the impacted areas.
There was evidence of foxes and other scavengers. We observed one
bear _ a sow and three yearlings _ that was in the contaminated
area, feeding on dead birds. ... We saw eagles carrying oil-covered
birds. We saw one eagle so coated in oil that it couldn't fly.''
   One state scientist said wind-whipped oil ``mousse'' was pounded
into a beach by wave action and buried a yard below the surface.
Another reported seeing otters surrounded by floating oil.
   Late Monday, Exxon offered a revised plan to clean up 364 miles
of tainted coastline by September, but environmentalists and Coast
Guard Adm. Paul Yost, the federal government's top official
monitoring the spill, immediately criticized it as inadequate.
   Dennis Kelso, Alaska's commissioner of environmental
conservation, said the proposal was ``a few pages of wishful
thinking ... (that) makes it appear as though cleaning those areas
is little more than a Sunday stroll on the beach.''
   Yost, who must approve the plan before it can go into effect,
called Exxon's strategy ``very thin.'' Yost briefly toured part of
the spill area Tuesday, visiting the USS Juneau, the Coast Gaurd's
command ship for the cleanup.
   Today, Yost was scheduled to take U.S. Transportation Secretary
Samuel Skinner on an inspection of the spill zone. At a speech
Tuesday in Washington, D.C., Skinner called the spill ``the most
significant environmental disaster this nation has ever faced.''
   On Thursday, he meets with Vice President Dan Quayle, who is
expected in Alaska after a 12-day tour of the Pacific.
   Exxon also faced a day of boycott Tuesday, as groups around the
country urged consumers to stop buying Exxon products. Consumer
activist Ralph Nader said in Washington that Exxon ``should not be
allowed to forget'' the spill and that a boycott would send the oil
giant a message.
   J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State
Gasoline Retailers Association in Billerica, Mass., said it was too
early to assess the boycott's impact.
   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said 10,000 of its 7 million
credit cards have been cut up and returned since the spill.
   In Anchorage, 400 chanting and sign-waving protesters rallied in
front of Exxon's Alaska headquarters, calling for a boycott.
   The Exxon Valdez is undergoing preliminary repairs in Prince
William Sound and is to be towed next month to Portland, Ore., home
of the only drydock on the West Coast capable of handling the
987-foot ship.

   Pop superstar Michael Jackson donned
a disguise to do a little shopping and all it managed to do was
attract attention.
   Police were called to a jewelry store after employees reported a
suspicious person was casing the joint. The suspicious person
turned out to be the Grammy Award-winning singer wearing a wig,
fake mustache, false teeth and eyelashes.
   Jackson and an unidentified 12-year-old boy had gone into the
store Monday to look at rings.
   ``I asked him `Why are you wearing a false mustache?''' said
H.N. Edwards, a security guard for the Sycamore Plaza shopping
center. ``He said `I have to _ I'm in disguise _ I'm Michael
Jackson.' When he told me this, my first thought was this guy had
gotten off the elevator between floors.''
   Police Sgt. Ken Tacke and Officer Gordon Weeks said they
questioned Jackson, and asked him to remove his disguise and show
his identification.
   ``He told the police he has to wear a disguise when he goes
shopping or he would be mobbed by the crowds,'' Edwards said.

   Less than two years after a life-saving bone

Carreras said he ``considered myself really discharged the day I

   That was in July, when his concert drew 150,000 wildly cheering
fans at a stadium in Barcelona, Spain, his birthplace and hometown.
Now, he is looking forward to his first post-surgery opera role in
``Medea,'' scheduled to open in July in Barcelona.
   He was in town for Thursday's benefit concert for the newly
established Jose Carreras International Foundation for the

   Businessman Harvey Mackay, whose first book,
``Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive'' sold more than a
million copies, says he enjoys the water so much he's diving in
again.
   Mackay said Tuesday he has sold world publication rights for a
second book to William Morrow &amp; Co. for hardcover and to Fawcett
Books, a unit of Random House, for paperback.
   Mackay said the new book will be broader and more in-depth than
``Sharks,'' in which he outlined his philosophy on how to become
successful and the insights he gleaned from his experiences in
building Mackay Envelope Corp. into a business with 350 employees,
sales of about $35 million and modern plants in Minnesota and Iowa.
   A person is never too old to achieve success, said the
56-year-old Mackay, who will address the subject of aging in the
new book.
   ``I don't believe in age,'' he said. ``Find something you love
to do, and you'll never have to work a day in your life. You find
people like that at any age level. Age doesn't limit people one
tenth of one percent.''

   A reputed mobster died Tuesday shortly after he
was found in a jail shower, his head encased in plastic bags and a
rope around his neck, authorities said.
   The shower door at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center
was locked from the inside. Gerald Scarpelli's death is being
investigated as a suicide, said FBI agent Bob Long.
   Scarpelli, 51, was awaiting trial on weapons charges and
allegations he was planning to rob a jewelry store in Bradley,
about 35 miles south of Chicago.
   Court documents indicate that on the day after he was arrested
last July, Scarpelli signed a handwritten statement about
participating in four gangland assassinations.
   Most of his statements remain sealed, but a summary of them
filed in federal court indicate that Scarpelli told the FBI a great
deal about the workings of the mob.
   However, his attorney, Jeffrey Steinback, said his client
``definitely was not cooperating'' with authorities. He said he did
not believe Scarpelli was murdered, but that ``pride'' drove him to
suicide.
   ``He was going through a very tough time,'' Steinback said.

   The countdown advanced smoothly
today toward Thursday's scheduled launch of Atlantis with five
astronauts and a robot probe to Venus.
   ``This time we're going to see if we can get it right,''
astronaut David Walker, who will command the flight, said Tuesday.
Four days earlier, a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds
before the planned liftoff.
   ``Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,''
Walker told reporters. ``We're extremely pleased the folks here at
the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready
to go again.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:48 p.m. Thursday.
   ``There are no major issues in sight,'' Robert Crippen, NASA's
deputy director of operations, said after a mission management
meeting Tuesday. ``We're pressing on.''
   Shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance
conditions would be favorable. The only concern was a threat of
crosswinds greater than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the
launch pad.
   Atlantis will carry into space the $550 million Magellan probe,
which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15-month journey to
Venus. The probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloud-shrouded
surface with a high resolution radar system.
   The launch attempt was halted on Friday because of a short
circuit in a fuel pump.
   Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a
suspect fuel line in half the time expected.
   Engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line, but tests
turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the
line, thought to be gas, might have been trapped air.
   Ronald Phelps, a shuttle test director, said the new countdown,
which started Tuesday, was compressed from three days to two by
eliminating some ``hold time'' that is built into the countdown in
case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the
first attempt.

<HEAD>The Country Closes Down for Lengthened Annual Holiday Week</HEAD>

   Japan has closed down for its annual weeklong
series of spring holidays, including one created by the government
this year just to encourage the industrious workforce to let its
reputation slide a bit.
   For many, the annual ``Golden Week'' started Friday, giving them
the rare opportunity to take up to nine days off in a row. For
others, time off began today, the first of three consecutive
official national holidays.
   April 29, which fell on Friday, has been a holiday for more than
60 years, marking the birthday of the late Emperor Hirohito. After
his death Jan. 7, its name was changed to Greenery Day.
   Constitution Day falls on May 3 and Children's Day on May 5.
This year, the government has made May 4 a national holiday also,
to encourage more people to take consecutive days off.
   ``It's different from foreign countries. Japanese generally
can't take several days of vacation at one time,'' said Reiko
Tomizawa of the Japan Travel Bureau, the country's largest travel
agency.
   ``People even used to work every other day during Golden Week
until the government made May 4 a holiday this year,'' Ms. Tomizawa
said. ``It's just the national character of the Japanese to work
hard without vacations.''
   But government officials believe the Japanese should devote more
time to leisure activities and spend more money on both them and
imports in order to reduce the nation's huge trade surplus.
   Earlier this year, the government instituted a shortened
five-day work week every other week for government employees. It is
enouraging private business to follow suit.
   A record 17.7 million Japanese, or 14.7 percent of the
population, are gong on trips of more than one night this week, and
an all-time high of 365,000 are taking advantage of the high value
of the yen to go overseas, according to a survey by the Japan
Travel Bureau.
   The most popular family destinations this year are Hawaii, Guam
and Hong Kong, the bureau said.
   Young, single ``office ladies'' are turning toward Canada and
Europe, the agency said. They usually save money by living at their
parents' home, and they have a reputation for being big holiday
spenders.
   Japanese are spending an average $2,107 on travel abroad, up 8.7
percent, and $394, up 8.9 percent, for domestic travel, according
to the agency's study.
   Many workers, however, see Golden Week as a time to lounge
around at home and avoid the jammed highways, hot springs, and
mountain resorts.
   ``It's too crowded and expensive to do anything,'' said Katsuya
Hirai, 33, who works in the sales department of a Japanese
automaker. ``And it's before our June bonus, so I don't have any
money right now.''
   ``I can afford to take the family for a day trip to a safari
park near Mount Fuji,'' he says. ``But my wife says she wants to
eat out every night.''
   Hotels across Southeast Asia report room shortages during the
week because of the Japanese influx, especially in popular
destinations such as Thailand, Hong Kong and even Singapore, until
recently suffering from a hotel glut.
   ``To make matters worse, some hotels in Southeast Asia are
becoming disenchanted with tour groups, the mode of travel
particularly favored by the Japanese,'' said the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, Japan's main economic newspaper.
   ``They are starting to focus on individual guests, where the
profit margins are higher and the noise level is lower.''

<HEAD>Panel Says Nuclear Plant Workers Were Paid Not to Testify on Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate investigators say they've discovered at
least two ``silence-for-money'' deals between builders of a Texas
nuclear power plant and workers who received payments in return for
dropping allegations of safety hazards.
   The Senate subcommittee on nuclear regulation said Tuesday it is
widening its investigation to determine the frequency and legality
of these secret deals.
   ``It's beginning to look like something that's throughout the
industry,'' said Bob Mann, an aide to Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the
subcommittee chairman.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses commercial
nuclear power stations and enforces safety rules, has not commented
publicly on the acceptability of agreements that limit a plant
worker's ability to raise safety issues.
   In private notices to all nuclear plant operators and vendors,
however, the commission last week said such restrictions were not
acceptable under any circumstances. It asked the companies to
notify the NRC of any such deals by July 31.
   ``It is not acceptable to include in settlement agreements for
discrimination matters ... or in any labor agreements or other
agreement ... any restrictions on employees or former employees
providing information to any members of the NRC,'' said the notice.
A copy was obtained by The Associated Press.
   Frank Ingram, a commission spokesman, said the letters were sent
in response to concerns raised by one of the Texas nuclear plant
deals cited by Breaux's panel.
   Breaux said such agreements hold frightening implications for
nuclear safety.
   ``It turns the licensing process into a sham if witnesses can be
paid money to withhold their testimony,'' he said.
   The panel has scheduled a hearing Thursday to hear from parties
to one of the Texas agreements, and from NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech
Jr., who was not involved in the deals. Breaux has blasted Zech and
other NRC commissioners for not publicly condemning the agreements.
   Subcommittee sources, speaking on condition they not be
identified further, said documents indicated Joseph J. Macktal, a
former electrical foreman at the Comanche Peak nuclear station,
received $35,000 for himself and his attorneys in a January 1987
agreement with the plant's builder, Brown &amp; Root. They said the
deal barred Macktal from testifying to the NRC regarding his
concerns about plant safety.
   Macktal contends in a new complaint with the Labor Department
that he signed the deal under duress.
   Brown &amp; Root, in a statement from its Houston headquarters, said
the payment to Macktal and his attorneys was in settlement of an
earlier complaint he made to the Labor Department that he was
forced to quit because he had questioned Brown &amp; Root's quality
controls at Comanche Peak.
   The payment was meant to limit litigation costs, the company
said.
   The company acknowledged that the deal prevents Macktal from
appearing as a witness before the NRC, but it said the intent of
this provision was to protect the company from ``the need to defend
against'' his Labor Department complaint in another forum.
   It said Macktal had ample opportunity to provide any safety
information to the NRC prior to signing the deal.
   The first of two reactors at Comanche Peak is 99 percent
complete and its owner, Texas Utilities Generating Co., is expected
to apply for a low-power license next year. The other reactor at
the site, near Glen Rose, is 85 percent complete.
   Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, said the Macktal agreement came to
light after the NRC's atomic safety and licensing board had ended
its Comanche Peak hearings last July.
   Subcommittee sources said the panel has documented another case
at Comanche Peak in which a worker who had raised safety concerns
received $30,000 as part of a deal with Gibbs &amp; Hill Inc., a
contractor at the plant site. They said the arrangement prohibits
the employee, Lorenzo Polizzi, from testifying before the NRC about
safety issues.
   At Gibbs &amp; Hill headquarters in New York, spokeswoman Debra Fay
said she was not familiar with the case and no company official was
immediately available to comment.
   The subcommittee also is investigating a contractor-worker
agreement involving the Millstone nuclear power station at
Waterford, Conn., the sources said. No details were provided.

<HEAD>EPA Putting New Limits on Cancer-Causers in Water</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of public water systems across the
country will have to improve their purification equipment to reduce
chemical contamination and comply with new Environmental Protection
Agency standards.
   The EPA on Tuesday proposed federally required ceilings on the
maximum amounts of 38 types of cancer-causing chemicals and other
pollutants allowed in drinking water.
   Michael Cook, director of the EPA office which deals with
drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already
meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification
equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems,
serving about 2 million people, mostly in rural areas.
   In some cases households will be paying higher water bills _
anywhere from $10 to $460 more a year _ as a result, officials
said, although the new requirements in many cases are unlikely to
go into effect until 1991.
   EPA said the size of consumer cost increases will depend on the
size of the water system and the contaminant and treatment
technology involved.
   Affected systems account for about 3 percent of all the public
water systems in the country, according to the EPA. Private well
water is not covered by the regulations.
   In addition, officials operating about 80,000 water systems
likely will have to increase monitoring activities to comply with
the new rules.
   The new regulations require that local water officials regularly
monitor the level of pollutants and make public whenever the levels
exceed the federal standard.
   The proposed regulations will not go into effect until a routine
comment period, likely about 90 days, and then the EPA will give
local water officials another 18 months before the tighter
requirements take effect. In some cases where economic hardship can
be shown, water officials will be given additional time to comply.
   The federal standards on the 38 chemicals, including many widely
used pesticides and other highly toxic carcinogens, would bring the
number of chemicals on which federal standards have either been
proposed or are in effect to 55.
   Three years ago Congress directed EPA to set maximum allowable
levels on 83 chemicals and other toxic pollutants, but agency
officials said Tuesday they will not be able to meet the
congressionally imposed June 1 deadline on 28 of them.
   Cook said development of federal standards on the remaining 28
is likely to take another year as maximum safe levels and water
treatment techniques are worked out.
   ``If we had more money and manpower we could have sped those
up,'' said Cook.
   The proposed standards announced Tuesday cover 17 pesticides
including alachlor, aldicarb and atrazine, which are widely used in
agriculture; 11 synthetic organic chemicals that have been found to
cause cancer or damage to the nervous system; and eight inorganic
chemicals, including asbestos, mercury, cadmium, nitrates and
nitrites; and two chemicals used to treat drinking water.
   The requirements ``are important steps in the continuing effort
to assure that Americans have the safest drinking water in the
world,'' said Cook.
   But some EPA critics maintained that the regulations, while slow
in coming, are also too weak.
   Jacqueline Warren, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the maximum levels required by the EPA are
significantly higher than ceilings already required by a number of
states.
   Furthermore, she said, the EPA is lifting some water pollutant
standards, including the ones for aluminum and silver. Both pose
health risks, she said.

<HEAD>Man Admits Killing Wife of 56 Years Because She Was Too Demanding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old man has pleaded guilty to
strangling his wife of 56 years, saying the ailing woman's demands
drove him to the breaking point.
   Harry Garfinkle pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter Monday
in the Jan. 21 death of his 84-year-old wife, Frances, in their
home.
   Assistant District Attorney Judith Rubino said she doubted
Common Pleas Court Judge Lisa Richette will sentence Garfinkle to
jail. No sentencing date has been set.
   ``I do not see the need for a jail sentence for this man,'' Ms.
Rubino said. Mrs. Garfinkle ``was very sick and he just snapped.''
   Garfinkle, a retired paperhanger who now lives in a retirement
home, said his last 26 years of marriage were torture. At the time
of her death, Mrs. Garfinkle was bedridden, deaf, and blind in one
eye. She continued to suffer the effects of a serious stomach
operation, which left her dependent on her husband.
   After pleading guilty, Garfinkle recalled his wife's demands:
``Complain, complain, complain. ... `Harry, give me this. Harry,
get me that.'''
   He also recalled that after strangling his wife with a necktie,
he told her, ``Frances, what did you make me do this for?''
   The judge gave Garfinkle a Bible and told him to read it every
night, but he said later he wouldn't because ``the letters are too
small.''
   ``I don't believe in anything anymore,'' he said. ``If there's a
Lord up there, why did he let it go on for so long?''
   Garfinkle said the couple's four children did not blame him for
the killing. At Monday's hearing, one son, Marvin Garfinkle, told
the judge his mother was ``extremely demanding, and, at the end,
she didn't really know how demanding she was.''
   The father said if he could live his life again, he would not
get married.
   The day of the slaying, he recalled, his wife's right foot was
severely swollen, she could no longer control her bladder and she
was in pain. She asked her husband when he was going to make
breakfast.
   ``That was it,'' Garfinkle recalled. ``I just exploded. You just
come to the breaking point. She drove me to it.''
   After strangling his wife, Garfinkle said, he swallowed 17
sleeping pills in an attempt to kill himself.
   At first, he lied to police, telling them Mrs. Garfinkle had
fallen out of her bed and that he had found her dead. Later, he
confessed.
   ``I pitied her so,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Urges US Allies to Denounce `Massive Election Fraud' in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is keeping his options open on
how to deal with Panama once it holds its election, which U.S.
officials predict will be rife with fraud.
   Bush on Tuesday urged Panama's neighbors and U.S. allies in
Europe to ``speak out against election fraud in Panama'' as he
stepped up the rhetoric against the country's defacto ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush's advisers have been working on policy options to employ
after Sunday's election, and ``no option has been ruled out,'' said
a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   However, this official and others have acknowledged that one
possibility is remote _ that of military intervention by the United
States, which maintains a hefty military presence along the Panama
Canal.
   They also say there is scant chance the United States will renew
the offer it made to Noriega a year ago _ to abandon federal
drug-trafficking charges against him if he leaves Panama. Noriega
has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Florida.
   The drug case began the slide in the once-cozy U.S.-Panama
relationship.
   Economic and trade sanctions instituted last year under
President Reagan have been extended by Bush but have failed to
loosen Noriega's grip on the country.
   On Tuesday, the president told a Latin-oriented business group,
the Council of the Americas that, ``It is evident that the regime
is ready to resort to massive election fraud in order to remain in
power. The Noriega regime continues to threaten and intimidate
Panamanians who believe in democracy.
   ``The United States will not recognize the results of a
fraudulent election engineered simply to keep Noriega in power.''
   While attempting to discredit the election ahead of time by
saying that Noriega has rigged it to ensure victory for his
presidential candidate, Carlos Duque, the administration has not
declared what post-election pressures it might bring to bear.
   ``Much will depend on what the Panamanians do,'' said the State
Department source. The official noted that an anti-Noriega fervor
that was building last year among the people seems to have lost its
momentum. Whether such sentiment is manifested again after the
election will no doubt influence the U.S. position, the official
said.
   In Panama, Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a spokesman for the pro-Noriega
Panamanian Defense Forces, said the opposition is demoralized ``and
they know they are going to lose the election.'' He said they sent
``an SOS to the White House.''
   Bush also on Tuesday criticized the election plans being laid by
the leftist Sandinista government of Nicaragua.
   He outlined guidelines by which the United States will judge
whether the Nicaraguan elections next February are free and fair,
saying the Sandinistas must allow outside observers to have access
to all election places and proceedings.
   ``It means a secret ballot on election day, the freedom to
campaign, to organize, to hold rallies and to poll public opinion,
to operate independent radio and TV stations as well,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Business Groups Complain About Workers' Insurance Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business representatives contend that American
workers would be better off if Congress repealed a new law aimed at
barring health-insurance discrimination against lower-paid
employees.
   ``We remain skeptical that it does anything to improve or extend
coverage of health care,'' James H. Gardner, a Californian speaking
for the National Federation of Independent Business, told the House
Ways and Means Committee Tuesday.
   Gardner said House legislation to revise the law would be an
improvement, but that the best course would be outright repeal.
   ``It will still be a new impediment and disincentive to
employers, especially smaller employers, to provide health
insurance,'' Gardner said.
   Similar objections were raised by other business representatives
who testified before the tax panel. But spokesmen for the Treasury
Department, the AFL-CIO and the accounting profession leaned toward
revising the law, known as Internal Revenue Code Section 89, rather
than repealing it.
   ``Prompt congressional action is needed to alleviate the
problems employers are experiencing in complying with Section 89,''
said Dana L. Trier, tax legislative counsel for the Treasury
Department. ``We believe the (revision) bill represents a major
step forward in achieving these goals.''
   He said Treasury advocates a complete revision of present law,
which he called a complicated mess.
   The law, enacted in 1986, aims to ensure that tax-deductible
health insurance plans do not discriminate in favor of higher-paid
employees. The statute requires employers to subject their health
plans to complex tests to determine whether they discriminate.
   Some employers say the complexity, paperwork and cost _ $50 per
worker, by one estimate _ are so onerous that they will find it
easier to drop their health plans rather than try to comply with
the law.
   Business has made repeal or modification of the law a major goal
this year. Congress has heard so many complaints that 300 House
members and close to a majority of the Senate have signed bills to
repeal the law. Most members of the Ways and Means Committee have
signed the revision bill, whose chief sponsor is Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   The complaints have been heard by the Bush administration, too.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady announced Monday that employers
would not have to test their health plans for compliance before
Oct. 1; the law originally had a Jan. 1, 1989, deadline.
   The federal government forgoes more than $30 billion a year in
taxes on the value of employer-financed health coverage.
   Rostenkowski's bill would eliminate most of the complicated
testing by requiring employers to provide to at least 90 percent of
their lower-paid workers health insurance costing the employees no
more than $10 a month for a single plan or no more than $25 for
family coverage.
   Calvin Johnson, legislative representative for the AFL-CIO,
praised Rostenkowski's bill but said the labor federation questions
whether it would make it possible for working families to qualify
for coverage. He recommended that a worker's out-of-pocket spending
for medical expenses be limited to $3,000 a year and that the
$25-a-week maximum premium under the bill be reduced.
   The committee was asked to provide special exemptions for state
and local governments, since such employers pay no federal taxes
and, thus, receive no tax deduction for the costs of workers'
insurance.
   Lee Cooke, mayor of Austin, Texas, speaking for the National
League of Cities, said at least 27 states require workers to pay
more than $10 a week for a single health policy or more than $25
weekly for a family plan.
   Overall, Cooke said, while congressional concern about the
$30-billion-a-year subsidy for health plans is understandable, ``We
believe that the burdens of the law far outweigh the benefits in
the public sector.''

<HEAD>Rehnquist Urges Congress to Raise Judges' Salaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist urged
Congress today to give the nation's federal judges an immediate 30
percent pay raise.
   Calling inadequate salaries ``the most serious threat to the
future of the judiciary,'' Rehnquist sought support for legislation
providing the raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments.
   ``This is not, in my view, fairly termed a pay raise,''
Rehnquist said in a prepared statement to the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee. ``This is instead a partial recapture of
the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected
judicial salaries over the last 20 years.''
   A 30 percent pay increase would boost the chief justice's annual
salary from $115,000 to $149,500. Salaries of Supreme Court
justices would rise from $110,000 to $143,000; appeals court judges
from $95,000 to $123,500; and trial judges from $89,500 to $116,500.
   There are about 700 active federal judges. About 300 others are
on senior status, meaning they do as much or as little work as they
wish. All receive the same raises.
   As chief justice, Rehnquist is a member of the Supreme Court,
heads the federal judiciary and chairs the policy-making U.S.
Judicial Conference.
   He said the Judicial Conference recognizes there was
``widespread public opposition'' to a defeated proposal for a 51
percent pay raise for senior government officials, including
members of Congress and federal judges.
   ``We believe, however, that a smaller increase of 30 percent for
federal judges is both publicly acceptable and fully justified,''
Rehnquist said.
   The chief justice also emphasized the importance of routine
cost-of-living adjustments in judicial salaries, which he said
``could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable `catch-up'
increases'' being proposed.
   Currently, federal judges receive the periodic raises given to
most federal employees by Congress.
   ``Congress' historical reluctance to increase its own pay levels
has often meant that cost-of-living increases for other senior
government officials have also been denied,'' Rehnquist said.
   Under the legislation backed by the Judicial Conference,
cost-of-living raises for judges would not be tied to similar
raises for Congress.
   Despite Rehnquist's complaint about infrequent cost-of-living
increases, federal judges have received them in most years since
1975. During that period, district court salaries have risen from
$42,000 to $89,500 and appellate court salaries from $44,600 to
$95,000.
   Last week, five Democratic and Republican members of the House
courts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that public
protests would likely block any judicial pay raise unless
non-working seniors judges were excluded. The judges opposed such
limits.
   The Associated Press earlier this year reported previously
unpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent of
the then-306 senior judges did no judicial work, including former
Chief Justice Warren Burger.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and Rep. Carlos Moorhead,
R-Calif., chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee,
subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other than
cost-of-living increases from senior judges who carry less than 25
percent of an active judge's caseload.
   But they also agreed, at the judges' request, to submit a bill
calling for the general 30 percent raise and annual cost-of-living
increases.
   President Bush has proposed a 25 percent increase along with a
ban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income. The
judges oppose both the ban and the limit.

<TEXT>
   The National Association of Broadcasters
concluded its annual gathering with a rousing call to arms by
outgoing FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick to resist government intrusion
into radio and TV.
   Patrick, who led the Federal Communications Commission's repeal
of the ``fairness doctrine'' that required broadcasters to present
opposing views of public issues, said Tuesday that broadcasting has
a constitutional duty to express opinions.
   ``You are all members of the press, no less than the editorial
boards of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal,'' Patrick
said. ``We, the members of the public, want to hear what you have
to say, we deserve to know your opinions.''
   But, he added, ``You are powerful, and for that reason we in
government have just cause to fear you.''
   At the same time, he said, government has ``no cause to attempt
to regulate your speech. Stand firm against any attempt to do so.''
   Even though the FCC lifted the fairness doctrine from
broadcasters in 1987, Congress is almost sure to reinstate it this
year, posing a veto fight with President Bush and a likely Supreme
Court test.
   Patrick's speech outlining the FCC's accomplishments was
interrupted a number of times by applause from the broadcasters and
exhibitors who descended on this gambling mecca for a four-day
meeting.
   NAB said there were a record 50,136 registrants this year, and
709 exhibitors plied a wide range of broadcasting hardware.
   High-definition television predominated, with more than 22,000
square feet of exhibit space and numerous technical and regulatory
panel discussions devoted to the multibillion-dollar television of
the future.
   Patrick thanked his audience for their ``unflagging support'' of
his policies against a hostile Congress and non-broadcast media
during his six years at the FCC.
   ``We have tried to foster competition at the FCC by lowering
barriers to entry, and by permitting broadcasters to compete as
freely as those with whom they compete _ namely cable,'' Patrick
said.
   Patrick announced last month he had resigned from the agency,
where he has been chairman for the past two years, but would stay
on until his replacement is confirmed.
   The 37-year-old California native said he would leave
government, but has announced no future plans.
   In addition to repealing the fairness doctrine, the FCC during
Patrick's tenure reinstated rules giving broadcasters exclusive
rights to programming in their broadcasting areas over cable
outlets, he said.
   He advocated further protection from the cable TV industry
through a requirement that cable systems pay for the over-the-air
programs they feed to their subscribers.
   Patrick noted how the FCC revised the means by which stations
renew their licenses to bar sham competitors who just want money to
drop their challenges to a station's license.
   And he noted the FCC's decision last year to make sure that a
U.S. standard for high-definition television will not render
obsolete the huge investment TV stations have in current equipment.
   American industry is racing to adopt standards with which to
build an HDTV system and stave off the expected appearance in the
next couple of years of foreign-made HDTV VCRs and movies.
   Patrick said broadcasters still faced many challenges:
fiber-optic cable and telephone entry into video programming;
competition from foreign media; further loss of audience; the
shifting of advertising from video to point of sales.

<HEAD>Business, Education Committee Calls for Cap on Liability Judgments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   States should set guidelines for awards in
damage suits because juries are blind to the impact their liability
judgments have beyond the courtroom, an organization of business
executives and educators said today.
   ``The benefits are immediate and visible: compensation to an
often tragically injured individual who is present in the
courtroom,'' the Committee for Economic Development said in a
176-page report by its Research and Policy Committee.
   ``In contrast, the magnitude of the costs and the bearer of
those costs are largely invisible,'' the CED said.
   The committee recommended adoption of statutory guidelines based
on such formulas as replacement of two-thirds of the plaintiff's
wages, which it said is roughly full replacement of after-tax
earnings.
   ``Future wage loss for children could be calculated at the
median annual earnings in the state,'' the panel said. ``Similar
general principles should be applied for calculating compensation
for medical, rehabilitation, and special educational expenses.''
   ``A fundamental flaw of setting the terms of a social insurance
program through the courts is that the jury has neither the
information nor the incentives to weigh the costs of its decisions
against the benefits,'' the committee said.
   It said one study showed that between 1960 and 1984, the average
jury verdict in California and Cook County, Ill., increased by more
than 300 percent in 1984 dollars after adjustment for inflation.
   The CED describes itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan and
nonpolitical educational organization of more than 200 business
executives and educators seeking to formulate policies to foster
economic growth and an improved standard of living.
   The panel said the current liability system ``neither
effectively deters nor efficiently compensates'' and the United
States should relay more heavily on alternative methods of dispute
resolution.
   In addition to increasing legal fees, court awards and insurance
costs, the present system results in indirect cots to Americans in
higher prices, withdrawn goods and services and damaged
international competitiveness, the study said.
   It called for a limit on punitive damages, a uniform federal law
on product liability, and more reliance on regulation to control
environmental and chemical hazards.
   It said workers' compensation should be revised and made the
sole recourse for injuries and diseases of the workplace.
   It also called for prohibiting lawsuits when a product complies
with regulation, except in cases of fraud or suppression of
evidence.
   It proposed a ban on liability for risks that could not be
anticipated at the time the product was manufactured.
   ``Punitive damages should be awarded only in cases of willful
misconduct and should be limited to a modest multiple of the
compensatory award,'' the committee said. It said this would
preserve ``incentives for prudent attention to risk'' while
avoiding exposure to ``unpredictable and potentially bankrupting
punitive awards.''

<HEAD>Bush to Use Commencement Speeches to Spell out Foreign Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will spell out the conclusions
of his wide-ranging foreign policy review in the next few weeks in
a series of commencement addresses dealing with East-West
relations, the Soviet Union and NATO, the White House says.
   ``Basically it will point out the Bush view of the world and the
United States' role in it and our attitude toward other
countries,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Tuesday.
   ``There will be some differences with existing policy although
the general thrust will not be too different,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``It's not clear to me there will ever be any written reports''
about the review, Fitzwater said. ``These speeches may in effect be
the most definitive enunciation of the results of that review.''
   Bush is scheduled to give five commencement speeches this month,
beginning with a May 12 address at Texas A&amp;M University. Fitzwater
said the topic of that speech will be foreign policy, although it
is not clear what the focus will be.
   A May 21 speech at Boston University will spell out Bush's view
of East-West relations and U.S. strategy for dealing with the
Soviet Union, the spokesman said.
   Then, Bush will use a May 24 speech at the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn., to discuss the strength of NATO and
the future of the 16-nation Western Alliance.
   Two days later, Bush will fly to Rome on the first leg of a
four-nation trip and a full NATO summit May 29-30. In recent days,
NATO has been shaken by a dispute over modernization of short-range
nuclear weapons stationed in West Germany.
   Bush's speeches will follow on the heels of next week's trip to
Moscow by Secretary of State James A. Baker III for talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze.
   Baker's trip is expected to produce a date for resumption of
negotiations to cut back long-range nuclear weapons and explore
possibilities for a summit sometime this year between Bush and
Gorbachev.
   The arms talks went into recess late last year and were expected
to resume in February, but were put off by Bush pending completion
of the foreign policy reviews.
   Fitzwater said the NATO summit and a seven-nation economic
summit in Paris in July will give further definition to Bush's
policies.
   With the first 100 days of Bush's administration completed,
Fitzwater said the next three months will concentrate heavily on
foreign policy objectives.
   Other commencement addresses by Bush this month will be on May
13 at Alcorn State University in Lorman, Miss., and at Mississippi
State University at Starkville on the same day.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Motorcades Tricky Business in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush travels to New York, he
gets there quicker than George Washington but slower than Ronald
Reagan.
   That's because Bush has eliminated one link in the trip used by
Reagan _ a fast helicopter ride into Manhattan from a nearby
airport, usually Newark.
   Instead, Bush prefers to travel within New York by motorcade.
   And that means he must land at the most distant of New York's
three major airports _ Kennedy.
   Closer-in LaGuardia won't accommodate Air Force One, a Boeing
707. And he can't use Newark, across the Hudson River in New
Jersey, for security and national defense reasons.
   A motorcade trip from Newark would require the president's
motorcade to pass through a tunnel under the river, and that would
put the chief executive out of radio contact with the rest of the
world _ unless special communications cables were laid through the
tunnel, deemed by the White House not worth the expense or effort.
   So Bush, who has been to New York twice as president, travels
through the nation's most populous city entirely by motorcade _
producing monumental traffic tie-ups as he goes.
   For last Sunday's trip, when Bush participated in a re-enactment
of Washington's inauguration 200 years before, Bush traveled by
motorcade all the way from Kennedy International Airport on Long
Island to Wall Street in lower Manhattan, a trip of about 35
minutes.
   Bush's decision not to use a helicopter to get into New York was
based on ``his preference to save money,'' said spokesman Stephen
Hart.
   ``At a time when we're facing budgetary constraints, it's one
way he could have an impact,'' Hart said.
   Hart said it was not clear how much was really saved by such a
step, however.
   Usually, four helicopters were involved when Reagan traveled
from Newark Airport into Manhattan, usually to a helipad at the
Battery _ one helicopter for the president and his top aides, one
for the Secret Service, another for lesser-ranking staff, and a
press chopper.
   At least some of the helicopters had to be flown up from
Washington.
   However, official motorcades through New York are, to say it
mildly, interesting.
   They are sometimes chaotic, hectic, frightening, exhilarating _
and always gridlock-forming.
   As president, Bush gets streets barricaded for him along the
motorcade route. That presents an unusual sight to anyone familiar
with New York's usually clogged streets _ block after block of
temporarily empty pavement.
   Of course, side streets and entrance ramps along the way become
hopelessly clogged with stopped traffic.
   As vice president, and as a candidate, Bush didn't always rate
such treatment, and his New York motorcades often had to vie with
and fend off other traffic.
   Sirens and flashing lights seem to have less effect on traffic
in New York than in other cities. Cars, buses and cabs frequently
dart in and out of the path of non-presidential motorcades.
   When a motorcade slows down too much, or too much of a gap opens
between cars, pedestrians and bicyclists often stream perilously
across the street between the gaps.
   During a campaign visit last spring, a vehicle in then-Vice
President Bush's motorcade struck a cab trying to edge into the
flow of traffic, crumpling its side. The motorcade kept moving, the
cab driver shaking his fist and hurling epithets.
   New York motorcades ``usually produce a higher percentage of
hand and finger gestures,'' asserts one White House staff member.
   Is saving the cost of helicopters worth the added cost of more
police officers along motorcade routes, and the jangled nerves of
those caught in traffic jams?
   ``You have to try to strike a balance,'' said Bush spokesman
Hart.
   And, he noted, Reagan only took choppers from the airport into
the city _ he still had to travel by motorcade within Manhattan.
   Although it takes Bush longer than Reagan to get to a New York
site, he's still a lot swifter than the nation's first president _
whose steps Bush retraced last Sunday.
   It took Washington a week in 1789 to travel from Mount Vernon,
in Virginia near what is now the nation's capital, to New York,
which was then the nation's capital. And he did it by horseback,
coach and barge.

<HEAD>Students Get Ideas From Both Soviets And Americans</HEAD>

   Students in China traditionally have looked to
the West for models of democracy, but this time they also are
inspired by currents of change across the border in the Soviet
Union.
   These Chinese see President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness, as an example they would like
their country's leaders to follow.
   China and the Soviet Union share similar histories of autocratic
government, state repression and socialist economic stagnation.
   In recent years, both countries have launched market-oriented
reforms aimed at modernizing their economies and raising living
standards to meet citizens' growing expectations.
   Economic liberalization under senior leader Deng Xiaoping has
brought relative prosperity to millions of Chinese.
   However, Deng has refused to imitate Gorbachev's political
reforms, which have allowed unprecedented open debate in the Soviet
Union over sensitive political issues.
   Only on the student-established ``free-speech platforms'' in the
streets of Beijing during the past two weeks have Chinese tasted
anything approaching glasnost. There, students and workers alike
have engaged in heated debates over China's political history,
economic problems and growing official corruption.
   Thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets
since mid-April and more demonstrations loomed after the government
today turned down a student demand that new independent student
unions be recognized.
   The students' demands that the government end official
privilege, nepotism and profiteering have especially struck a raw
nerve among many Chinese who are angered by 30 percent inflaction
and blatant displays of ill-gotten wealth.
   The workers who joined the students in last week's triumphant
march through Beijing's streets said the leadership's refusal to
enact democratic reforms and allow the press to freely speak out
against abuse of privilege are partly to blame for the country's
economic woes.
   ``Sure, there's been some improvement, and I do better than most
people,'' said taxi driver Zheng Jun. ``But the leadership's rotten
to the core, and it's incompetent too.
   ``There should be a way for the ordinary people to reach the
government with their problems,'' he said.
   Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi, in a recent essay, alluded to the
Soviet example when he called for ``use of open glasnost-style
means to root out corruption.''
   The Chinese Communist Party has said political reform, meaning a
shrinking of its role in government and business, will take a
decade, and that it will be at least 20 to 30 years before national
elections are possible _ a slow process the students want to
accelerate.
   ``The Soviets are ahead of us. At least they have elections,''
said another Beijing resident.
   ``Maybe when Gorbachev comes to China on May 15 we can
demonstrate and get his help,'' said Beijing University student
Wang Qiang.
   While they have turned to Moscow for support and ideas, the
students' concepts of democracy and freedom were inherited from an
earlier generation of Chinese intellectuals, many of whom studied
at the Sorbonne, Oxford and Harvard and returned to spearhead
protests in their homeland.
   Chinese who studied in the West played key roles in the May 4,
1919 student pro-democracy movement and in the Communist revolution.
   The t students, who want fundamental reform of China's
tightly controlled political system and an end to widespread
corruption, se Western democracies as models frotests,
freedom of speech and the press, and democracy _ views shared by
many Chinese.
   Numerous students said American student protests in the 1960s
against the Vietnam War inspired them to take to te streets,
despite the fact thamerica at that time was China's No. 1 enemy.
   ``Don't American students protest, too?'' they asked repeatedl   Few
expect concrete support for their efforts from abroad, but
they did welcome news of a U.S. State Departmtatement May 26
that said: ``The United States believes in and supports the right
of peaceful ly, including peaceful protest and the freedom onot only in
China but around the world.''
   The students repeatedly ask journalists to report the news of
thts accurately ``to let the world know what is happening
in China,'' one student said, ``and so other countries can support
us.''
   ``We want support from around the world,said another.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has quietly
rescinded a nine-year-old ban on U.S. military personnel attending
Soviet functions celebrating May Day and other occasions.
   The decision, disclosed Tuesday by defense sources and confirmed
by the Pentagon's chief spokesman, was announced in a memorandum
dated April 27 that was distributed throughout the U.S. military.
   The memo states Cheney had lifted ``restrictions on attendance
by Department of Defense personnel at Soviet receptions or other
functions in the United States to mark May Day or Victory in Europe
Day, imposed after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan'' in December
1979.
   Dan Howard, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, said the decision
simply reflected the Soviet Union's recent withdrawal of troops
from Afghanistan and nothing more.
   A similar restriction on high-level State Department personnel
was lifted in mid-February, according to administration sources.
That was why U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock viewed the May Day
festivities in Moscow on Monday from the official diplomatic review
stand _ the first time that has been done in 10 years, the sources
said.
   According to Cmdr. Mel Sundin, another Pentagon spokesman,
active-duty and civilian defense officials were specifically barred
in early 1980 from accepting invitations to functions tied to four
key Soviet military observances _ Soviet National Day in November;
Armed Forces Day in February; May Day on May 1; and Victory in
Europe Day on May 9.
   The ban was imposed by the Carter administration just after the
invasion and has been ``rigidly enforced ever since,'' said one
defense official who requested anonymity.
   The first change in that enforcement occurred last November when
some restrictions were relaxed governing Soviet National Day and
Armed Forces Day observances, Sundin said. At the time, the Soviets
had agreed under United Nations auspices to withdraw their troops
from Afghanistan.
   Now that the withdrawal is complete, ``Cheney has lifted all the
restrictions,'' Sundin added.
   Cheney's decision was disclosed just a few days after he made
headlines by predicting Kremlin chief Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
efforts to overhaul the Soviet economy would fail.
   Gorbachev, who got the Russian troops out of Afghanistan, is
likely to fail with his restructuring efforts and be replaced by a
leader ``far more hostile'' to the West, Cheney said in a TV
interview broadcast last Saturday.

   Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis is not the
frail, whispery-voiced woman the American people saw standing by
the side of President Kennedy, says the author of an unauthorized
biography of the former first lady.
   The real Jackie, says writer C. David Heymann, is a
strong-willed woman who was probably a principal designer of the
Kennedy administration's Camelot image.
   ``The image of this good Catholic husband with two beautiful
children and a beautiful wife posing on the White House lawn was
not the case,'' he said.
   In his book, ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' which went on sale
Tuesday, Heymann attempted to unravel the life and character of one
of the world's most admired, photographed and written-about yet
enigmatic women.
   ``Although there have been so many things written about her,
nothing I read really did the woman justice,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``Everything was based on gossip and innuendo.
I felt something along definite lines should be written.''
   His 631-page book is based on interviews with 825 people,
including friends, employees and family members, but none of the
Kennedys.
   The author, by appealing to the director of Presidential
Libraries in Washington D.C., gained access to the former first
lady's White House social files. Through the Freedom of Information
Act, he obtained thousands of pages of previously undisclosed FBI,
CIA and Secret Service files.
   Heymann's purpose was not to document the public successes and
failures of the Kennedys' years in the White House, but to
scrutinize their successes and failures as individuals _ as husband
and wife.
   Indeed, a good portion of the book is devoted to the slain
president's many alleged liaisons with women.
   ``A lot of this wasn't my original intention to go into his
affairs in such depth,'' said Heymann. ``I had merely heard all the
rumors and innuendo. But, as a result of digging into various
files, ... a lot of this became fact not merely rumor.
   Mrs. Onassis' spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman, has said Mrs.
Onassis would not comment on the book. A telephone message left at
her office Tuesday was not returned.
   According to Heymann, Kennedy once sneaked out of a New York
hotel for a sexual liaison without telling the Secret Service and
without taking the list of codes he needed in the event of a
nuclear attack.
   Langdon Marvin Jr., a former defense consultant to Kennedy who
had accompanied him on the jaunt, was quoted in the book as saying,
``The Russians could have bombed us to hell and back, and there
would have been nothing we could have done about it.''
   The date of the alleged incident was not given. Marvin died in
1987, according to Sandra Bodner, a spokeswoman for the publisher,
Lyle Stuart.
   Heymann wrote that Mrs. Kennedy, who married Kennedy in 1953,
responded to her husband's sexual dalliances by being ``glacially
cold'' toward him and going on spending sprees.
   ``It was at these junctures that she went on shopping binges,
disbursing thousands of dollars on jewelry, designer clothes,
paintings; whatever captured her fancy,'' he wrote.
   After the August 1963 death of the Kennedys' third child, when
the boy was just 3 days old, the couple seemed to grow closer in
their grief, Heymann wrote.
   But Mrs. Kennedy's life was shattered on Nov. 22, 1963, in
Dallas when her husband was assassinated while riding with her in a
motorcade.
   Heymann wrote that the first lady refused to take a sedative as
she waited in her blood-splattered outfit at Parkland Memorial
Hospital.
   ``I don't want a sedative,'' Mrs. Kennedy reportedly said. ``I
want to be with my husband when he dies.''

<HEAD>Explosives-Detection Bill Advances In House</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that would give airlines and airports
$270 million for devices to detect plastic explosives goes before a
House committee Thursday, after a subcommittee rejected Republican
efforts to make airlines pay half the cost.
   The legislation requires installation of the sophisticated units
in U.S. and foreign airports that are considered vulnerable to
terrorists. It does the same thing as a Transportation Department
order last month, which would have airlines pay the full cost of
the units.
   The bill, passed Tuesday by the House Public Works aviation
subcommittee, would take the $270 million from an aviation trust
fund without budgeting new money. The fund has accumulated more
than $6 billion in fees collected from airline passengers for
airport improvements.
   Republicans tried to amend the measure to require that U.S.
airlines pay half the cost, but the bill received no opposing votes
when it passed with full federal funding for the security devices.
   The Transportation Department last month ordered airlines to
install the sophisticated bomb-detection machines at high-risk
airports. Both the order and the legislation call for detection
systems such as thermal neutron devices that have been tested by
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Tuesday he expects
the first machine to be installed in July at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York and the second at an airport in
Great Britain. He said several more should be in place before the
end of the year.
   Skinner was in Europe last week meeting with officials of other
governments about aviation security as a result of the Dec. 21
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland that killed 270 people.
He said the administration feels the airlines should pay for
additional security, using revenue from security fees collected
with passengers' tickets.
   The legislation would provide up to 100 percent grants to U.S.
airlines and airports which would own, operate and maintain the
detection units expected to cost about $1 million each. The airline
grants also would cover installation in high-risk foreign airports.
   Subcommittee chairman Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., argued that
the government should pay for the devices that would examine
checked-in baggage because the government, not airlines, has been
the target of terrorists.
   Other governments will be paying for security units used by
their airlines, which would put them at a competitive advantage,
Oberstar said.
   Republicans argued that airlines have always paid for security
equipment at airports, and the subsidy could lead to other moves to
use federal money to help airlines.

   American agents are ``plugged into the
underworld'' of illegal diversion of deadly chemical weapons
materials, but their successes are being undermined by the courts,
says the U.S. customs commissioner.
   ``The penalties we have are there,'' William von Raab told the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee at a hearing Tuesday on the
illegal export of biological agents and other material used to make
chemical weapons. ``The problem is judges don't apply them.''
   The Customs Service, through informants and various sting
operations, has controlled to some degree the diversion of the
materials to terrorist nations, von Raab said.
   ``With the volume we're dealing with, I don't think we're losing
a lot,'' he said. ``We're pretty well plugged into the underworld.''
   However, the effort by the Customs Service, the State Department
and the Commerce Department has been thwarted by the judicial
system, which has failed to impose stiffer penalties, von Raab said.
   The commissioner described the case of Peter Walaschek, a West
German national arrested for purchasing three orders of
thiodiglycol, a precursor for mustard gas, from Alcolac
International Inc., of Baltimore, Md., for shipment to Greece and
Singapore. The shipments were re-exported to Iran.
   Customs agents, suspicious of Walaschek's third order, told
inspectors in Norfolk, Va., to seize the chemical and replace it
with water. The agents then tracked the shipment of water to
Singapore; Karachi, Pakistan; and then Bandar Abbas, Iran.
   Walaschek was arrested on July 27, 1988, in Maryland and pleaded
guilty to violating the Export Administration Act. He admitted that
he purchased the chemical at the request of Sayed Kharim Ali
Sobhani, an Iranian diplomat stationed at his country's embassy in
Bonn, West Germany.
   But under protests from the government, Walaschek was placed in
a halfway house. He later fled and is currently a fugitive in West
Germany.
   Von Raab said another part of the problem is that the criminals
give the impression of being average businessmen.
   ``They look normal, they've done normal things _ offering and
accepting merchandise _ but what they're dealing with is poison,''
the commissioner said.
   The chemical industry is the United States' largest
international trading industry with total shipments in 1988 at $238
billion, according to the Commerce Department. Current export
controls apply to 40 of an estimated 20,000 commercially traded
chemicals and chemical products.

<HEAD>Air Force Gives More Details on B-2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Air Force general has offered a
surprising amount of detail about the new B-2 stealth bomber,
disclosing it will have great range, an ability to land almost
anywhere and a payload of 25 tons of bombs.
   The plane's capabilities will be such that had the B-2 been
available in 1986, when American bombers attacked Tripoli, Libya,
``just three to four B-2s could have done the job direct from
stateside bases,'' said Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, the head of the
Air Force Systems Command.
   More than 100 combat and support aircraft from the Air Force and
Navy were used for that bombing mission. The B-2 would require at
most two tankers to fuel it during the mission, Randolph said.
   Randolph, in making his revelations last weekend, said little
about the cost of the B-2 or of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
recent budget decision to postpone the start of production by a
full year.
   But he asserted to a meeting of aviation reporters in Phoenix,
Ariz., that the B-2 was nothing less than a ``quantum leap into the
21st century'' that was essential to America's future strength,
thanks to its ability to slip behind enemy lines without being
detected on radar.
   Randolph appeared before the reporters on Saturday. A text of
his remarks was released later at the Pentagon.
   Not only is the B-2 destined to become a key part of America's
nuclear arsenal, but it offers a capability to deliver conventional
weapons that is unmatched among manned bombers, Randolph said.
   The Libyan bombing raid ``could have been conducted with greater
tactical surprise and vastly less risk of life,'' he said.
   Among Randolph's disclosures:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The B-2 will be capable of flying more than 6,000 nautical
miles _ or 6,900 statute miles _ without refueling. With one
mid-air refueling, it will be able to fly more than 10,000 nautical
miles or 11,500 statute miles.
   _The plane will have a maximum takeoff weight of more than
350,000 pounds and will be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of
either nuclear or conventional bombs. Specifically, it will be able
to carry 16 large nuclear weapons, 20 smaller nuclear bombs, or up
to 80 conventional 500-pound bombs. The B-52, the mainstay
strategic bomber, carries 60,000 tons of bombs.
   _The plane is designed to operate with minimal support equipment
and can land on any runway that's just 40 feet wide, meaning ``it
can operate from any airfield that can handle a 727 commercial
airliner.''
   ``With one air refueling, operating from just four bases _ two
stateside and two overseas _ the B-2 could cover any point on the
world's land mass on a non-stop radius mission carrying a full
conventional payload,'' Randolph said.
   ``Those possibilities could deter a great deal of adventurism.''
   Randolph also announced the first flight of the B-2 would
probably occur in about two months, but only when the Air Force was
convinced the plane was ready.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., is a
futuristic-looking gray-and black ``flying wing'' designed to evade
enemy radar and deliver nuclear weapons. It resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
a rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar, due to the extensive
use of exotic composite materials; its lack of sharp surface
angles; and a cross-section that offers a very small profile to
radar.
   Before Cheney's decision to slow production, the Air Force had
estimated 132 of the planes would cost $68.1 billion. Even if money
spent on research and development is set aside, that amounts to
production costs of $305 million per plane.

   Elections for borough offices never draw
long lines at the voting booth, but this year's contests set a new
standard for apathy.
   Candidates outnumbered voters in Monday's election, when only 21
people voted for the 22 candidates. Nearly all the voters were
either running for office or were relatives of the candidates.
   Every two years, the borough, which administers the center of
the southwestern Connecticut town, stages elections that generate
little opposition or interest. No political affiliations are noted
on the ballot. The positions include board of tax review, zoning
commission, fire inspector, tax assessor and tax collector.
   Jean St. Jean, a candidate for burgess, a borough council, said
a persistent drizzle may have kept the throngs home this week.
   The winners?
   Everyone.
   Even Clerk Ethel Connor, who forgot to put her name on the
ballot, kept her post. She received 13 write-in votes.

   The House budget document usually makes
for dry reading, but it's well-thumbed this year.
   Hidden among thousands of items are several gags. On page 243,
between spending for the Department of Corrections and salaries for
state employees, are 15 sports trivia questions. A word jumble
asking arcane questions is on another page.
   On the cover, a newspaper cartoon shows a threadbare pauper
examining his empty pockets _ a visual reference to the no-frills
spending plan the House Appropriations Committee approved Monday.
   ``There's not enough in there to take seriously. It's what's not
in there that's got everybody upset,'' said Appropriations Chairman
T.K. Wetherell. ``I thought everybody would read it this year for a
change.''
   The $22.7 billion spending plan also has buried in it an offer
of $10 and a free turkey dinner to the first member of the capital
press corps who finds it.
   The Miami Herald bureau chief, Mark Silva, was the winner but
declined the reward.

   What's in a name? In this rapidly
developing community, there're omelette makings for some.
   Huevos (Egg) Circle and Jamon (Ham) Lane are some of the street
names in the same neighborhood of Mission Viejo, which has grown
from scratch to 75,000 people in 23 years.
   The Spanish heritage of the area has inspired some fanciful
names for places and streets. The original Rancho Mission Viejo was
established under a Spanish land grant.
   ``The story was told that when they decided to have a Spanish
theme for the community _ Barcelona walls, Franciscan bells,
Spanish-themed architecture _ they decided all streets would have
Spanish names,'' said Wendy Wetzel, director of corporate
communications for the Mission Viejo Co.
   But Ronald Harmon, professor of Spanish and Portuguese at
California State University, Fullerton, said some of the names are
silly.
   ``Unfortunately people don't often have a clear sense of what it
means to use another language, so they use it
impressionistically,'' Harmon said. ``It just sounds `Spanishy.'
The other thing is that people have a tendency to seek the exotic,
and foreign names are exotic.''
   The race to name streets included one called Rabida, (rabid).
Other names: Via Fabricante (Manufacturer Street), El Charco (The
Puddle, near Lake Mission Viejo), and Via Remolino (Whirlpool
Street).

<HEAD>Jackson Supports Lucas Appointment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson says
``questions remain'' over the appointment of William Lucas to head
the Justice Department's civil rights division, but he supports
Lucas nonetheless.
   Jackson commented after meeting Tuesday with Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, who said later that he had made ``a pitch'' to
Jackson about Lucas, 61, whose nomination has been opposed by the
NAACP.
   Jackson revealed his attitude toward Lucas only in response to a
reporter's questions, and when asked directly whether he supported
him, Jackson said only, ``Yes.''
   ``I hope that he will honor the trust that the government is
putting in him,'' Jackson said. ``I have reason to believe he
will.''
   The nomination of Lucas, a black Democrat-turned-Republican who
lost a race for governor of Michigan in 1986, has been opposed by
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
nation's oldest and largest civil rights group.
   Also opposing the nomination is Rep. William H. Gray, D-Pa., who
said he was surprised by Jackson's support.
   ``I don't know why Mr. Jackson said what he said,'' said Gray,
the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.
   Lucas is ``an outstanding human being ... but his public service
has been in law enforcement,'' said Gray.
   ``He is better suited for deputy drug czar or deputy FBI
director, and not as chief policy maker on civil rights enforcement
in the Justice Department in light of no litigatory experience or
policy experience, unless you're making the assumption that anybody
with black skin has the qualifications,'' said Gray, who is black.
``I don't make that assumption and I find it offensive when people
do make that assumption.''
   Lucas, a Detroit lawyer, has been an FBI agent, sheriff of Wayne
County, Mich., and the chief executive for that county. Thornburgh
spokesman Dave Runkel said the assistant attorney general position
``is a law enforcement job and needs someone with a law enforcement
background and management background.''
   Among those supporting Lucas are some members of the
Congressional Black Caucus and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
   Rep. John Conyers, a black Democrat from Detroit, said a Senate
fight by civil rights groups to block the Lucas nomination ``would
be a useless one, maybe even counterproductive.'' He invited
members of the caucus to meet informally with Lucas on Tuesday
afternoon.
   The nominee spent more than an hour with seven members of the
23-member caucus.
   Jackson said one of the main reasons he visited Thornburgh was
to fight for the rights of sugar cane workers from Jamaica and the
British West Indies.
   ``Because the sugar cane growers have lobbied to exempt sugar
cane as a perishable product, they are less eligible to get their
green cards and are therefore denied access to citizenship in this
country,'' he said.
   Jackson also criticized public housing officials who, following
the leadership of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp, are evicting innocent people when one family member is
involved with drugs.
   ``I talked to a mother today who has lived in an apartment for
24 years and her son was arrested _ not arrested, indicted, tried
and convicted, just arrested _ and her furniture is on the
street,'' he said.
   Thornburgh told Jackson to talk with Kemp about the situation.
   A HUD spokesman said Kemp ``has been quite cautious in deciding
where waivers should be granted on federal administrative rules
regarding evictions. Those waivers will only be granted in those
states where the due process rights of the tenants will clearly be
protected.''

<TEXT>
   Folks in Zap still shudder when they
recall the day 20 years ago when 2,000 drunken college students
rioted on Main Street and set a bonfire, causing $3,000 in damage.
   Saturday, a new generation of students plan a sequel.
   But Denise Schlegel, organizer of Zip to Zap II, promises a more
sedate celebration, one she hopes can erase hard feelings that have
festered in the town of 300 people since 1969.
   ``I want to show them that people are different and things like
this can work out,'' said the 21-year-old junior at North Dakota
State University in Fargo. ``We are mending fences in a way.''
   The school newspaper, The Spectrum, organized the first Zip to
Zap for a spring fling. But chaos erupted that May day and the
National Guard was called in to disperse the rowdy students.
   Although many Zap townspeople are apprehensive about college
students again invading the quiet hamlet, Schlegel, the editor of
The Spectrum, believes Zip to Zap II not only will restore her
newspaper's image. It also will provide an economic boon to the
town about 90 miles northwest of Bismarck.
   ``It all started as a Spectrum picnic in Zap 20 years ago,'' she
said. ``We have gotten a bad rap from it, and I just want to show
that things can work out. People can get together in a gathering
and it doesn't have to be a disaster. ... I don't think the
drinking is the same as it was 20 years ago.''
   Schlegel harbors no fears that Zip to Zap II will get out of
control, calling today's college students more mature and less
radical than their 1960s' counterparts.
   ``I don't think we are going to be starting street fires,'' she
said.
   Schlegel expects up to 1,000 students from campuses across North
Dakota to descend on Zap for 11 hours of free rock 'n' roll plus
some volleyball games.
   Six bands have volunteered for the show, which starts at 1 p.m.
in a pasture near the town, she said.
   Zap is gearing up to handle 2,000 people, said Tammy Schmidt,
president of the Community Club, a civic organization with 20
active members.
   Schmidt, 29, barely remembers the May 10, 1969, event, when she
was living with her family in nearby Beulah, but said: ``Everybody
was scared, seeing it on television.''
   The Mercer County Sheriff's Department expects to have about 15
officers in Zap on Saturday and Highway Patrol officers also will
be around, Deputy Sheriff Dean Nodland said Tuesday. ``We really
don't foresee that ... it is going to get out of hand,'' he said.
   Townspeople in Zap are split on whether another batch of college
revelers should even be let into town, Schmidt said. Some want the
town barricaded. ``They harbor the bad memories,'' she said.
   She doesn't expect a repeat of the disturbance but remains
cautious.
   ``When people are intoxicated, moods swing. If we knew this was
an annual event, we would know what to prepare for. But with a
20-year gap in it, it leaves anything and everything up in the
air,'' Schmidt said.
   The town is hoping to cash in, however. At least seven portable
food stands will be set up, Schmidt said. And the Zap Community
Club had 500 souvenir T-shirts printed with the message:
   ``I Zipped to Zap and had a blast.''

<HEAD>Soviet Wheat Sale Plan Praised in Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's announced plan to sell 1.5
million metric tons of subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union was
praised in Congress, but didn't settle concerns about the future of
the export bonus program.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, who had pressed the president
to use export subsidies in the Soviet sale, said Bush's decision
Tuesday sends ``a strong signal America is playing to win in the
international marketplace.''
   ``This action is welcome news for our farmers,'' he said.
   ``I applaud it,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat who
chairs the House subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grain.
``But in announcing this deal the administration did not quell the
concern about the future of the Export Enhancement Program.''
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said
he talked to the president by telephone Monday night and urged him
to approve the deal.
   ``There should be grain sales to the Soviets,'' he said. ``I'm a
strong supporter of using the Export Enhancement Program when it
makes sense.''
   Competition in the international wheat market is strong, with
many other countries using heavy subsidies to lure buyers. The
Export Enhancement Program has been the U.S. response to the
competition, but its future has been in doubt.
   The Bush administration, following the lead of the Reagan
administration, has called for eventual elimination of all export
subsidies worldwide, though the president has said he would not do
away with EEP unless other countries did likewise.
   Nevertheless, no EEP sales have been processed since the end of
February and Congress has been after the administration to start
moving.
   ``They were reacting to congressional pressure,'' Glickman said
of the president's announcement.
   At a Senate subcommittee hearing last month, an Agriculture
Department official said the program had been suspended pending a
budget review.
   In a letter to Bush earlier this week, Dole said, ``It's clear
that any budget review of the program is not an appropriate reason
to suspend new offers at this time.''
   He said the Agriculture Department is required to use $770
million to finance EEP sales this year.
   Glickman said he still intends to find out what role the Office
of Management and Budget played in slowing down the EEP program.
   ``The fact of the matter is we are still operating under a cloud
started by the Reagan administration,'' said Glickman. ``What I
would have liked to have seen is a clear and unequivocal statement
about their support for the Export Enhancement Program.''
   ``We heard that OMB was arguing against this one,'' said Sen.
Robert Kerrey, D-Neb., a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee
who has been pressuring Bush's budget office for information about
the EEP slowdown.
   He applauded the decision to sell to the Soviets as good for the
United States.
   ``It also is a victory for those of us who look for ways to
encourage the reforms that (Soviet President) Gorbachev is pushing
for his nation,'' he said.
   The EEP program involves subsidies to U.S. exporters in the form
of surplus government-owned commodities. The exporters are able to
sell grain to a foreign buyer at a reduced price and then collect
government surpluses as ``bonuses'' or subsidies to make up the
difference.
   The Soviet Union and China have been major buyers under the
program, with the Soviets buying more than 4 million tons of U.S.
wheat for delivery in 1988-89. In addition, the Soviets have bought
about 14.6 million unsubsidized tons of corn for 1988-89.
   According to the Agriculture Department, since the subsidy
program began in 1985 it has helped sell more than 81 million tons
of grain to all foreign recipients, including about 60 million tons
of wheat, plus assorted other products such as frozen poultry, eggs
and dairy cattle. In all, the sales are valued at about $8.14
billion, with the subsidies costing more than $2.5 billion.

<HEAD>ABA Says no Deal with Thornburgh on Judicial Screening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh misstated the
position of the American Bar Association when he said its judicial
screening panel has agreed to stop considering the political and
ideological views of candidates for the federal bench, say two
leaders of the organization.
   ABA President Robert Raven and Harold R. Tyler Jr., chairman of
the Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, both disagreed Tuesday
with Thornburgh's description of what has been produced by
discussions with the attorney general about judicial screening.
   The issue is sensitive because Thornburgh's choice to be deputy
attorney general, Robert B. Fiske Jr., could face tough questioning
by conservative senators about the job he did running the ABA
screening committee.
   Also, there are some 50 vacancies on the federal bench.
   The two ABA officials said there is no agreement with the
Justice Department.
   Tyler said the panel has only ``expressed a willingness'' in
discussions with Thornburgh to delete a clause from the guidelines
that says political views and ideology are not considered ``except
to the extent that they may bear upon the other factors''
considered by the screening panel.
   ``I don't think we have reached any agreement on the exact
language'' of any change to be made, Tyler said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Thornburgh had told the House Judiciary
Committee that the ABA committee during this decade has begun
assessing the ``ideological or political views of prospective
nominees.''
   As a result of discussions, the attorney general said, the ABA
will ``restrict their examination and assessment only to those
areas where they have special expertise.''
   ``We are pleased that the American Bar Association standing
committee has seen fit to withdraw from an area not only
contentious but in my view improper for their consideration _ that
is to say the political and ideological views of the prospective
nominees,'' Thornburgh told the House panel.
   David Runkel, a special assistant to Thornburgh, said that he
understood the agreement was based on an ``exchange of letters''
last week following ``personal discussions between ABA leaders and
top aides to the attorney general.''
   He said the ABA has agreed to return to pre-1979 language that
said ``The committee does not attempt to investigate or report on
political or ideological matters with respect to the prospective
nominee.''
   Tyler said the only letter he is aware of was one he wrote April
4 to the attorney general summarizing their conversation that day.
   Fiske, Thornburgh's choice for his deputy, has not been formally
nominated by President Bush. But Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
charged in an April 17 letter to the president that Fiske shared
the names of prospective nominees with liberal groups,``thus
enabling those groups to target conservative candidates even before
their nominations were made public.''
   At Tuesday's hearing, Thornburgh said the agreement with the ABA
resulted ``through the efforts largely of Robert Fiske.''
   His remark appeared calculated to mollify Humphrey and other
conservatives.
   Tyler said he had discussed the issue and others with Fiske but
``I didn't realize I was in any negotiation.''
   The ABA has been accused by liberals and conservatives of
considering political views when rating a nominee's qualifications
for the judiciary. The rating is delivered during Senate
confirmation hearings.
   Charges from conservatives that the process was being
politicized surfaced in 1987 after the ABA committee disclosed that
four of its 15 members dissented from a recommendation that Robert
Bork was qualified to sit on the Supreme Court.
   Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in both political
parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the process. Some
senators have called for the ABA committee to reveal the sources of
its information about candidates and how each member voted on a
nominee.
   The Supreme Court is considering a legal claim that the Federal
Advisory Commission Act requires the ABA panel to meet in public.
   Such a requirement, the ABA says, would inhibit its ability to
gather information from professional peers of judicial candidates.

   Americans strongly support increased U.S.
financing for United Nations peacekeeping, disaster relief, food
production, population control and health programs, according to a
public opinion poll released today.
   The survey by the Roper Organization also found that 58 percent
of nearly 2,000 randomly chosen adults believed the United States
should abide by all decisions of the World Court, which has only
advisory powers.
   Fifteen percent said Washington could disregard the court.
   In 1984, Washington rejected the court's authority in a case
involving the U.S.-funded Contra war in Nicaragua.
   When conflicts break out among countries where the United States
has an interest, 49 percent said U.N. forces should be used to try
to accommodate all parties.
   Just 17 percent said Washington should use its troops to impose
its own solution; 20 percent said ``it depends,'' and 14 percent
had no opinion.
   Sixty percent said all U.N. members, including the United
States, should pay their full dues to the world body regularly
rather than withhold funds to force changes. Fourteen percent said
funds could be withheld; 14 percent said ``it depends;'' 12 percent
had no opinion.
   The Reagan administration and Congress have withheld more than a
$500 million from the United Nations to force fiscal reforms and
because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization.
   President Reagan finally vowed that the United States will pay
all its back dues if present reforms continue. President Bush also
made that pledge.
   When asked how much money the United States and other U.N.
member countries should spend on various U.N. projects, the
respondents favored more funds for social programs except in
economic affairs:
   _46 percent wanted more spending to bring peace to regional
conflicts; 11 percent favored less money, 31 percent said the right
amount is spent now, and 11 percent had no opinion;
   _53 percent wanted more spending to stop disease and improve
health care; 8 percent favored less money, 28 percent said the
right amount is spent, and 11 percent had no opinion;
   _48 percent wanted to spend more to slow population growth by
providing birth control information and devices; 11 percent said
``spend less,'' 30 percent were satisfied now, and 11 percent had
no opinion;
   _58 percent want more spent to increase world food production; 7
percent want to spend less, 26 percent were satisfied and 9 percent
had no opinion;
   _58 percent wanted to spend for environmental protection, 6
percent wanted to spend less, 26 percent were satisfied and 10
percent had no opinion;
   _53 percent favored more funds for disaster relief; 6 percent
said ``spend less,'' 32 percent were satisfied and 9 percent had no
opinion;
   _45 percent wanted to spend more to monitor human rights; 12
percent said less should be spent, 31 percent were satisfied and 12
percent had no opinion.
   However, 36 percent were satisfied with the current level of
spending to help manage the world's economy; 31 percent wanted to
spend more; 20 percent wanted less spending and 13 percent had no
opinion.
   The poll was paid for by the United Nations Association of the
United States of America, a New York-based non-profit, non-partisan
group with 20,000 members that studies ways to improve the
effectiveness of the world body.
   The Roper Organization conducted the poll in late March through
personal interviews with the adult respondents. The margin of error
was about 3 percent.

   The U.S. cultural center in the
provincial city of Kwangju, attacked 26 times by radical students
since 1981, will be moved and temporarily closed, news reports said
today.
   Gerald McLoughlin said the center that he directs would close
May 10 to move to an as yet undetermined location, according to
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   But officials at the U.S. Embassy denied that the center, 180
miles southwest of Seoul, would close even temporarily. A spokesman
said the question of a new location was still under study in
Washington.
   U.S. officials have been considering a move since early this
year after repeated attacks by radical students yelling anti-U.S.
slogans and hurling firebombs and rocks.
   Anti-U.S. sentiment is relatively high in Kwangju because of the
bloody military suppression of pro-democracy civil uprising there
in May 1980. About 200 people were killed and more than 1,000
others injured in the nine-day uprising.
   Many opposition and dissident figures claim the United States
shares responsibility for the bloodshed by acquiescing to a South
Korean government plan to ruthlessly quell the uprising.
   The United States denies the charges.

<HEAD>FDA Advisory Panel Urges OK of Drug to Treat AIDS-Related Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Food and Drug Administration advisory
committee has recommended approval of a drug used to treat an
AIDS-related condition that can lead to blindness.
   Tuesday's approval of the drug ganciclovir was the second AIDS
drug the committee has recommended for approval in two days of
hearings. On Monday, the panel recommended approval of the
aerosolized version of pentamidine to ward off initial and
recurring bouts of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which kills 60
percent of AIDS patients.
   The committee's decision was based on new data that found
ganciclovir is effective in treating cytomegalovirus retinitis in
AIDS patients.
   FDA approval of ganciclovir is expected this summer, and
approval of aerosol pentamidine is likely within weeks, said an FDA
source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Advocates of programs to fight AIDS have been pushing the FDA to
move quickly on approving the drugs.
   Ganciclovir has been widely available to AIDS patients since
November when the FDA approved use of the drug for treatment of
patients who were in the immediate, sight-threatening stage of
cytomegalovirus retinitis.

<NOTE>Bush Surprises Press, Calls It a Day</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A familiar-sounding voice boomed out over
White House loudspeakers Tuesday evening announcing the end of the
business day.
   It was President Bush, personally announcing he was going home.
   It was the first time in anyone's memory that the president
himself had performed the daily chore.
   ``Ladies and gentlemen of the press, the president having gone
home for the day, there is a lid on,'' Bush said. A ``lid'' is the
term used to tell reporters that no more paperwork or presidential
actions are expected.
   Bush made the announcement while walking from the Oval Office to
his residence in the White House. Noticing a gathering of reporters
hanging around the press office, Bush asked why they were still
there.
   They said they had to wait for him to leave and for the White
House to announce a lid. Bush asked what a lid was, and a reporter
explained the term.
   Usually a lid is announced by a press aide using a telephone
that is hooked up to a White House announcement system. Bush asked
for the telephone and made the announcement himself at 6:40 p.m.
EDT.
   He departed for his quarters as the press cheered his
announcement.

<NOTE>Third World Inflation Jumped to 58.3 Percent in 1988</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices paid by consumers in Third World
countries jumped an average 58.3 percent last year, up from 35.7
percent in 1957, the International Monetary Fund reports.
   The average rise in the United States and 20 other industrial
countries was only 3.3 percent, a rise from 2.9 percent.
   The figures come from a monthly report distributed Tuesday.
   Inflation figures for the Third World were heavily influenced by
Latin America _ Brazil's 682 percent, Argentina's 343 percent and
Mexico's 114 percent. These are the Third World's three biggest
debtors as well.
   Mexico reported a slowdown from last year's 132 percent but
Brazil and Argentina were moving up. Argentina's annual rate was
over 387 percent in December, and Brazil's 1,170 percent in January.
   Nicaragua surpassed them all with 10,205 percent for 1988 and an
annual rate of just under 24,000 percent in December but the
country is too small to count for much in the overall average.
   There was also a rise of inflation in Asia, to 11.6 percent from
7.3 percent. China's rate was up beyond 20 percent, compared less
than 9 percent in 1987.

<NOTE>Consumer Activist Calls For Boycott of Exxon at Gas Pumps.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. ``should not be allowed to
forget'' the Alaskan oil spill, says consumer activist Ralph Nader
in calling for a consumer boycott of the oil company's products.
   Nader joined representatives from several environmental and
consumer groups in denouncing Exxon for its failure to be prepared
for and rapidly respond to the oil spill that has fouled hundreds
of square miles of pristine water and shoreline along Alaska's
southern coast.
   ``Exxon should not be allowed to forget this oil spill,'' said
Nader, suggesting Exxon and the entire petroleum industry must be
made aware of public outrage over the spill.
   ``Americans can take action now by voting with their steering
wheel and dollars against all Exxon products,'' Nader said at a
news conference called in connection with a protest against the oil
company in several cities across the nation.
   An Exxon spokesman, Bill Smith, said in a telephone interview
from New York that more than 10,000 Exxon credit cards have been
turned in since the Alaska spill, but he could not speculate on how
the spill has affected Exxon sales.

   Paul H. Nitze, top arms control adviser in the
Reagan administration, says President Bush is missing a strategic
opportunity by refusing to open talks with the Soviets on
short-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
   In an interview in today's New York Times, the 82-year-old
veteran negotiator says talks on cutting back on missiles with a
range of less than 300 miles would actually be in the interest of
the West. They would provide an opportunity to eliminate a large
advantage held by the Soviet Union, he said.
   The Bush administration is pressing for development of a new
generation of short-range nuclear weapons while opposing the
U.S.-Soviet talks demanded by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Nitze terms the administration's approach ``politically
impossible for much of Europe.''
   Nitze has served in a number of national security posts,
including Navy Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense. In the
early part of the Reagan administration, he was the chief
negotiator of the treaty to ban intermediate-range nuclear forces
in Europe.

<HEAD>ABC Pulls `Crimes of Passion II' for Lack of Advertisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC says it didn't broadcast a special featuring
re-enactments of real-life crimes of passion because there were no
advertisers.
   An ABC executive said the lack of advertising reflected
corporate concerns about public opposition to sex and violence on
television.
   The show, ``Crimes of Passion II,'' had no advertisers as of the
day before its scheduled Saturday broadcast, the network said
Tuesday. ABC said ``in the best interests of the network and its
affiliates,'' the show was replaced with two 1988 comedy pilots.
   ``It happened because there is a sensitivity on the part of
advertisers to programs of this nature,'' said Ted Harbert, senior
vice president of programming for ABC. ``That's clear, that's
obvious and that's growing.''
   Executives at several major advertising agencies said they could
not recall any previous network program that had failed to attract
advertising and was removed from the schedule.
   A press release for the special, whose host was actor Bruce
Dern, said it ``explores real-life cases in which people have
committed an act of violence aimed against someone they love.'' The
program included two stabbings, a shooting and an incident in which
a man set fire to his wife.
   The first ``Crimes of Passion'' was broadcast in October and
garnered a 13.2 rating and 23 share in the Wednesday time period
now occupied by ``China Beach.'' By comparison, ``China Beach'' had
a 12.2 rating and 21 share last week, according to the A.C. Nielsen
Co. The rating is a percentage of the nation's 90.4 million
households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in
use.
   Though ``Crimes of Passion'' did reasonably well in the ratings
last fall, it was in a better time period than ``Crimes of Passion
II.'' It would have been broadcast on Saturday night, when ABC's
ratings are much lower. ``Livin' Large'' and ``Heart and Soul,''
the replacement shows, were among last week's lowest-rated shows.
   Had the show run without any paid advertising, it would not be
rated by Nielsen, and that would have hurt the network's affiliated
stations during the May sweeps period, when the ratings are used to
determine local advertising rates.
   Earlier this season, advertisers pulled out of NBC's Geraldo
Rivera high-rated special on devil worship and others backed off
NBC's satirical ``Saturday Night Live.'' A Michigan woman's
campaign against Fox's raunchy ``Married ... With Children''
received publicity earlier this year. Fox says the relatively
high-rated show remains sold out nonetheless.

   Arline Thomas, who became known as the ``bird
lady of Queens'' for rescuing and sheltering wild birds, has died
at age 85.
   Mrs. Thomas died of congestive heart failure Monday at
Huntington Hospital on Long Island.
   Mrs. Thomas treated 200 or more wild birds a year and until
recently was a member of the Audubon Society's volunteer
bird-saving corps. She held federal and state licenses to treat
wild birds. The licenses stipulate that the birds must be released
when they are well.
   She treated her first bird, a one-eyed nuthatch suffering from a
sprained wing, more than 30 years ago. Neighbors in the borough of
Queens soon began to bring her injured birds, and she learned to
care for them properly with help from the New York Zoological
Society's head birdkeeper.
   Between May and September, she would devote about 12 hours a day
to the birds. She had ducks in her bathtub, birds perched on the
edge of mixing bowls when she made cakes, and a bluejay that poked
cashew nuts into the ear of a pet rabbit.
   Mrs. Thomas wrote several books on the care of wild birds,
including ``Bird Ambulance,'' ``Mockingbird Trio,'' and ``Salty.''
   Survivors include a stepson.

<HEAD>Boycott Of Exxon Products Called Unfair</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE NANO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The one-day boycott of Exxon products around the country is the
start of a ``war of words and actions'' against the nation's
largest oil company over its huge Alaskan spill, environmentalists
and politicians say.
   The campaign Tuesday met with mixed results in scattered cities
and dissents from independent service stations who say they're
victims of the spill, too.
   ``I just think the end result is not going to be to hurt the
people who are responsible,'' said Evan Jaeger, who manages an
Exxon station in Elmwood Park, N.J. ``It's going to hurt the little
guy trying to make a living.''
   Exxon issued a statement calling the boycott unjust, and a
company executive defended the cleanup of the spill.
   ``We cannot undo what happened,'' said Exxon U.S.A. President
William D. Stevens in Houston. ``However, we can, and we are,
taking every possible action to limit the damage, clean up the
mess, and otherwise mitigate the impacts.''
   But consumer activist Ralph Nader said Exxon ``should not be
allowed to forget'' the nation's worst oil spill and that a boycott
was the way to send a message to the oil giant.
   Nader joined representatives from several environmental and
consumer groups in accusing Exxon of failing to be prepared for the
spill and not rapidly responding to the accident that has fouled
hundreds of miles of Alaska's coast.
   ``Americans can take action now by voting with their steering
wheel and dollars against all Exxon products,'' Nader said in
Washington.
   Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Johnson said 10,000 credit cards out of
7 million have been returned to the company since the March 24th
spill.
   Exxon said it had received no reports from dealers of a loss in
volume of gasoline sold as a result of the credit-card return or
from boycotts.
   Only about 5 percent, or 620, of the 12,400 Exxon brand stations
in the United States are owned and operated by the company. The
rest are independent.
   J. Edward Surette Jr., executive director of the Bay State
Gasoline Retailers Association in Billerica, Mass., said his group
did a statewide survey of dealers Tuesday but it was too early to
assess the impact of the boycott.
   ``The Exxon dealer had no more to do with that oil spill than
the barber who last cut your hair,'' said Surette, saying it was
unfair for consumers to vent their anger at dealers.
   Rallies supporting the boycott were held in Portland, Ore.,
Boston and Anchorage, where about 400 chanting and sign-waving
protesters rallied in front of Exxon's Alaska headquarters.
   ``We are beginning the war of words and actions against any oil
company that doesn't understand its responsibility to protect the
environment,'' declared state Sen. Carol Amick, lead organizer of
the boycott movement in Massachusetts.
   In Portland, more than 100 people rallied in the shadow of
Alaskan oil tankers being repaired at the shipyard where the
ruptured Exxon Valdez is scheduled to be inspected next month.
   In Eugene, Ore., three dozen protesters picketed an Exxon
gasoline station, chanting such things as ``Cut the card, save the
Earth.''
   ``We need to show Exxon that massive environmental destruction
is more than just bad public relations: It is bad business,'' Marc
Osten, of the State Public Interest Research Group, said in
Portland. ``We must boycott them until the Gulf of Alaska is clean,
until innocent victims are compensated and until we are assured
that this will never happen again.''
   The Alaskan spill and an explosion at a North Sea oil rig have
heightened concerns over gasoline supplies for the summer's peak
driving season. Crude oil prices have risen more than $7 a barrel
since January.
   Since the accident, gasoline prices have increased an average 10
percent nationally, while the Pacific Northwest saw surges as high
as 25 percent in less than a month, said Marla Rae, executive
assistant to Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer.
   The rise in prices since the spill prompted calls for a federal
investigation from Frohnmayer and state attorneys general in
Washington, Idaho and Utah, and U.S. senators from Nebraska.

   A spill of 100,000 gallons of sewage into a
flood control channel triggered a precautionary closure of 3{ miles
of beaches as waste trapped behind sandbag dams was pumped back
into sewers.
   Results of water samples from the beaches were due today, said
Toby Staheli, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services. ``We don't know what, if anything, got into the
ocean,'' she said.
   Beaches were closed Tuesday from the Venice pier south to
Dockweiler State Beach.
   The 100,000 gallons of sewage spilled when a power outage shut
down a pumping station in Inglewood on Monday night, said Don
Avila, a Sanitation Districts spokesman.
   Sewage flowed out of manholes for almost an hour until portable
generators put the plant back in operation, he said.
   The waste went into Centinela Creek, but a sandbag dam was
constructed in the channel to keep it from getting into Ballona
Creek, which flows into the ocean.
   Avila said about 1,000 gallons of waste may have gotten through
the sandbags but it was chlorinated as it passed through.

<HEAD>Mrs. Thatcher Reaches 10th Anniversary Of Election That Brought Her
To Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years ago today an election swept Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher to power, and she continues to prevail
over a divided opposition despite a recent poll indicating a lot of
voters are fed up with her.
   There was no word today from 10 Downing St. of any special
events to mark the anniversary, which television, radio, newspapers
and magazines have marked with numerous programs and articles in
recent weeks.
   Mrs. Thatcher, 63, is the century's longest continuously serving
British prime minister and the headquarters of her Conservative
Party has printed a glossy booklet called ``The First 10 Years''
glowing with praise for her.
   She is now midway through her third term following Conservative
victories in the 1983 and 1987 general elections. Despite
indications of growing dislike among many voters of her
strong-willed personality and right-wing policies, she has said she
plans to try for a fourth term.
   A series of polls released this week indicate most Britons want
Mrs. Thatcher to step down soon and think her right-wing revolution
has gone too far.
   But while they said they don't like her, the likelihood is they
will go on voting for her because they respect the woman who has
always led what The Economist weekly calls a ``reluctant nation.''
   The Economist noted, for example, that virtually throughout Mrs.
Thatcher's tenure, Gallup soundings have never registered more than
24 percent support for a basic Thatcher doctrine: tax cuts rather
than increased state spending, particularly on welfare.
   The soundings published Sunday and Tuesday are part of a
nationwide assessment of ``Thatcherism'' prompted by the
anniversary of the Conservative Party's 1979 election triumph over
Prime Minister James Callaghan's Labor Party government.
   Mrs. Thatcher took office the following day, May 4. Europe's
first woman prime minister had been elected by a nation weary of
strikes and inflation and yearning for strong government to reverse
national decline.
   In the opinion polls, she scored high for qualities such as
determination and courage. Her most popular policies, the polls
showed, are curbing the trade unions and allowing public housing
tenants to buy their homes.
   Britons see their country as having gained respect abroad, while
becoming a more aggressive, violent and selfish society.
   A leader who set out to wipe out socialism from Britain, Mrs.
Thatcher also appears in most soundings to be presiding over a
nation that has not taken her message to its heart.
   A Market and Opinion Research International poll published
Tuesday in The Independent, a London daily, showed only 30 percent
support for the notion that ``private interests and a free market
economy should dominate.''
   According to a Harris poll in London's liberal Observer
newspaper, 58 percent think 10 years of Mrs. Thatcher is enough.
And 66 percent agreed with the statement, ``Mrs. Thatcher has gone
too far in her policies.''
   But just 7 percent of the 1,040 voters questioned by Harris
actually expected Mrs. Thatcher to resign within the next few years.
   The soundings also showed a generally subdued reckoning by
voters of the Thatcher revolution. For example, just 37 percent of
the 1,001 voters questioned by Gallup for the conservative Sunday
Telegraph said they thought that overall Britain is now a better
place to live in.
   And while 67 percent dislike Mrs. Thatcher personally, 63
percent respect her.
   The polls also showed most Britons think the country has become
more violent, citing soccer hooliganism and street crime.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has won big majorities of around 42 percent
of the vote while the left-of-center is split, continues to be the
party leader most think would be the best prime minister. And when
it comes to casting a vote, she ends the first 10 years with 2 to 3
point lead over Labor in most soundings.

<TEXT>
   Ah, it's spring again, and college students' fancies are turning
to protests even as final exams loom.
   In at least four states, echoes of the '60s could be heard as
students took aim at proposed budget cuts, tuition increases and
union recognition.
   And at a prestigious college, student protests culminated in
getting Coca-Cola products banned.
   Thousands of protesting City University of New York students
skipped classes Tuesday and marched through lower Manhattan as a
deadline approached on a state spending bill that would reduce
money for higher education and force a tuition increase. Hours
later, Gov. Mario Cuomo vetoed the bill.
   At the University of California, Berkeley, teaching and research
assistants planned to begin a two-day walkout today and picket
campus entrances to protest the school's refusal to recognize their
union.
   Mount Holyoke College administrators in South Hadley, Mass.,
under pressure from students to boycott Coca-Cola products because
of the company's ties to South Africa, announced a monthlong ban of
the company's soft drinks.
   In New York, about 4,000 students stepped up protests that began
last week.
   Placard-carrying, chanting students from the university system
assembled in front of the World Trade Center, where Cuomo's New
York office is located. They blocked traffic for several hours,
then paraded past City Hall and to the Wall Street financial
district.
   ``It's not just a matter of this tuition hike. If we let them
go, it will be more,'' said Armando Howard, a 29-year-old physics
student. ``It will cut out the opportunity for people to rise.''
   Cuomo had given no indication what his decision would be. But
one hour before the midnight deadline, he vetoed it, saying
university officials had failed to prove the need for the extra
money.
   At Berkeley, neither the 3,200-member Association of Graduate
Student Employees nor university officials would predict how many
assistants would join today's walkout.
   ``So far, our indications are that this could be more symbolic
than a significant disruption,'' said university spokesman Tom
Debley.
   The dispute is over the university's view that the assistants'
work cannot be considered employment because it is so intertwined
with educational experience, said Debley. Assistants receive annual
stipends from the university or research institutions averaging
about $10,000.
   The association has been seeking recognition since 1983 as a
union so it can negotiate better pay and benefits and improved
working conditions. But the Public Employment Relations Board
recently ruled students do not have to be considered employees for
the purposes of collective bargaining.
   The association is appealing the decision.
   In Ohio, a two-day commemoration was to begin tonight at Kent
State University to mark the May 4, 1970, shooting deaths of four
students by National Guardsmen during an anti-Vietnam War
demonstration.
   At Mount Holyoke, a memo to students today outlined immediate
steps to replace Coca-Cola products with beverages from companies
with little or no business interests in South Africa.
   The decision came Tuesday after 60 protesters shouted anti-Coke
slogans outside school President Elizabeth Kennan's office and
chased a Coke delivery truck down the street.
   Students have pressed administrators for two months to remove
Coca-Cola products because, they say, the company is reaping
profits that benefit white-ruled South Africa.
   ``I think it's a monumental step. I think it shows some
responsibility on the part of the administration in terms of
listening to students,'' said Kuhusu Wanzu of the the American
Friends Service Committee in Atlanta, the Quaker group that has
tried to organize boycotts at several campuses.
   A Coca-Cola spokesman in Atlanta called the students misguided
and quoted from a letter by South Africa's Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, an anti-apartheid leader.
   ``I am sorry to hear that Coca-Cola is ... being accused of
aiding and abetting the apartheid regime,'' Tutu said in the April
10 letter, according to Coca-Cola spokesman Mark Preisinger.
``Nothing could be further from the truth.''
   Tutu continued: ``It is easy to sound more radical from the safe
and comfortable distance of 10,000 miles than those who bear the
brunt of the viciousness of the apartheid machinery close at hand.''

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, ``The owl ...' to CORRECT to `through' sted `threw'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWDEN, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A great horned owl swooped down and
scratched the face of a 6-year-old boy riding a bicycle, and
doctors fear he may lose his left eye.
   Tyler Tharp underwent several hours of surgery at University
Hospitals in Iowa City after Friday's attack, and doctors told his
family a decision will be made this week whether they can save the
eye.
   The youngster was listed in fair condition Tuesday.
   A family friend, Jean Oberholser, said Tyler was riding his bike
near his home in Lowden, an eastern Iowa town of 700 people, when
the owl struck.
   ``The owl hit him right in the face and a talon hit him directly
in the eye,'' Ms. Oberholser said. ``It made a T-shaped cut.
Originally, I don't think anyone thought they could save the eye,
but yesterday they said he could see light through it.''
   Craig Jackson of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources said
the attack probably was made by a female owl protecting her young.
   ``We can't verify it, but we assume there was a baby owl on the
ground when the youngster went by on the sidewalk,'' he said.
``Whenever young are around, animals become very protective. But
I've never heard of great horned owls attacking someone to this
extent.''
   Jackson said authorities destroyed both owl parents, not knowing
which one attacked and fearing the bird might attack again. He also
said officials were forced to destroy the offspring.
   Great horned owls, named for their large ear tufts, are
protected birds but are not considered endangered or threatened.

   Former Mayor Kenny Middleton defeated Evers, 390-248, in
Tuesday's Democratic primary. Middleton will face independent
William E. Smith in June's general election.
   ``I feel fine. I'm relieved,'' said Evers, who did not actively
campaign. ``It was time for a change. ... I could feel the people
wanted a change, but I didn't want to quit.''
   Evers' brother, Medgar, was shot to death in an ambush in

<HEAD>Search Of Archives Turns Up Evidence Of Missing Train</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A locomotive missing for more than 100 years in
eastern Colorado has been found, but not by the 300 volunteers who
searched for it in January with magnetometers and front-end loaders.
   It turns out the train was recovered months after it was buried
by a flood, said Craig Dirgo, spokesman for the National Underwater
and Marine Agency, a private organization that sponsored the search.
   ``The train isn't out there,'' said Dirgo. ``It was dug up at
the end of August 1878 by a second search party. The initial search
party quit.
   ``We know it was taken to Armstrong, Kansas, near Kansas City,
and was rebuilt.''
   The engine's ultimate fate, however, remains a mystery.
   Last January, best-selling author Clive Cussler, who founded the
agency, Dirgo and 300 volunteers used magnetometers and front-end
loaders to search a dry river bottom outside of Bennett, 30 miles
east of Denver, hoping to find the missing Kansas-Pacific railroad
locomotive.
   But that hunt, and another involving about 25 people the
following weekend, failed to turn up any sign of the train.
   The engine, 19 cars and a caboose fell 30 feet from a bridge the
night of May 21, 1878, when a flood struck the area.
   Twelve cars and the locomotive were reported to have been buried
in the sand. The front brakeman, fireman and engineer were killed.
The engineer's body was found about 10 miles downriver.
   Cussler, who wrote the book ``Raise the Titanic'' and lives in
Golden, has located 54 sunken vessels through his organization. His
book, ``Night Probe,'' was written with the missing locomotive in
mind.
   But on Monday, Cussler learned that the engine had been raised
more than 110 years ago.
   A friend, Don Snoddy of Omaha, Neb., found the information from
documents at a Union Pacific museum. Union Pacific bought Kansas
Pacific sometime after the flood.
   The documents Snoddy found indicated the locomotive was removed
from the river bed in the middle of the night in August 1878, Dirgo
said. It was rebuilt two years later and received a new number in
1885.
   ``We've been trying to figure out why it was covered up,'' Dirgo
said. ``It was removed late at night, and they denied for years
that it was uncovered.''
   Dirgo said he and Cussler originally thought the locomotive's
recovery might have been part of an insurance fraud because Kansas
Pacific had been in financial straits at the time of the flood, and
the engine was valued at $18,000. But that theory didn't seem
right, he said.
   ``I don't think it was insurance fraud,'' Dirgo said. ``In
talking to everybody, they didn't really have insurance back then.''
   Many Bennett residents, including 79-year-old Emma Mitchell,
whose father worked on the cleanup following the flood, had
staunchly believed the locomotive remained in a sandy grave.
   ``How they tricked an entire town for a hundred years,'' Dirgo
wondered.

<HEAD>Najib Says Afghanistan In Danger Of Becoming Second Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Najib says Afghanistan is in
danger of becoming a ``second Lebanon'' and has urged the West to
help end the war between his Soviet-backed government and
U.S.-armed Moslem guerrillas.
   ``It is in the interest of the West to ensure and maintain peace
and to establish a broad-based government through a multi-party
system, not through attempts to bring to power a small extremist,
fanatical group,'' Najib said Tuesday.
   Speaking to foreign reporters during an hourlong news conference
at the Foreign Ministry, Najib said Western countries should
embrace a ``new spirit of detente'' and do their utmost to help
reach a political settlement.
   Najib spoke after the United States spurned his government's
repeated calls for direct talks. Washington supplies most of the
weapons to Moslem guerrillas fighting to overthrow Najib's Marxist
regime.
   The United States and its allies say they will not deal with a
government installed by Moscow.
   Najib suggested that more fighting could turn Afghanistan into a
``second Lebanon,'' a reference to the sectarian battles that have
wrought havoc in Beirut for 14 years.
   ``The West must decide who the United States is aligning itself
with _ a band of cutthroats. Just look at beautiful Jalalabad,''
Najib said through a translator.
   He said the rebels are firing between 2,000 and 3,000 rockets
every day into the eastern city 40 miles from the Pakistani border.
   In Islamabad, Pakistan, the rebel Afghan News Agency said the
guerrillas killed at least 35 soldiers, captured 37, destroyed
eight tanks, and captured two others since Sunday in fighting south
of Jalalabad.
   Pakistani-based guerrillas began attacking the city three weeks
after Soviet forces on Feb. 15 ended nine years of involvement in
the civil war that began after an April 1978 communist coup.
   After initial gains by the rebels, the battle for Jalalabad
appears to have settled into a stalemate with casualties believed
to number in the thousands on both sides.
   The capture of Jalalabad would give the insurgents a badly
needed victory to bolster their predictions that Afghanistan's
Marxist rulers would fall soon after Soviet soldiers left.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, a fundamentalist faction leader who serves
as foreign minister of the guerrillas' self-proclaimed government,
called on the Soviet Union also to stop arming the Afghan
communists.
   His written statement, distributed Tuesday, said an end to
Soviet military aid would ``enable the real representative of the
Afghan nation to assume power in order to hold elections of a
representative government, which will work to normalize future
relations between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union.''
   In his remarks, Najib claimed that 65,000 rebels had agreed to
stop fighting, but he gave no details.
   Soviet forces entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help the communist
government battle the rebels. More than 100,000 troops were in the
country when the Soviets signed a U.N.-sponsored agreement in April
1988 to withdraw.

   Investigators trying to solve the second
reported baby abduction from the same family in three years have
released a cryptic bit of information about the likely, but so far
unknown, suspect.
   Police Sgt. Rick McCain said the FBI's National Center for
Analysis of Violent Crime came up with a psychological profile of
the person responsible.
   ``We've been led to believe that the perpetrator will suffer
severe anxiety as time passes,'' McCain said, ``and this will be
manifested in behavior the subject will be unable to control. It's
my feeling that it will make this person known to police.''
   McCain, the department's chief of detectives, refused to
elaborate on what kind of behavior might be expected or how
investigators might spot it.
   And he refused to say why police released that part of the
report.
   McCain said police still had hopes for the safe return of
6-week-old Heather Sims, whose parents, Robert and Paula Sims, said
she was abducted by a masked, armed intruder at their home Saturday
night.
   He said investigators have found no evidence disproving the
parents' story, that for the second time in three years a masked
gunman abducted their baby daughter.
   ``There's nothing to indicate that the Sims are anything but
victims at this time,'' McCain said.
   Their 13-day-old daughter, Loralei, disappeared under almost
identical circumstances in 1986.
   Loralei's body was found five days later, about 150 feet from
the couple's home in Brighton. No cause of death was determined and
no arrest was made in the case, although investigators at the time
said the parents were suspects.
   Dr. Janis Robinson, a pediatrician who examined Heather on April
22, said the baby had been in good health and there was nothing
unusual in the way Mrs. Sims had handled her.
   Detectives returned to the Simses' neighborhood Tuesday, asking
neighbors whether they had seen or heard anything that could help.
   ``We haven't found anyone who saw the alleged assailant, but
that doesn't mean there wasn't one,'' McCain said.
   The Simses have refused to talk to reporters.

<HEAD>First Anniversary Of Death With No Burial In Sight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials in the Marcos family's
hometown have a ``day of mourning'' for Thursday's first
anniversary of the death of Ferdinand Marcos' mother, whose body
still lies in an open casket.
   The Marcoses refuse to bury Josefa Edralin-Marcos, who died May
4, 1988, until President Corazon Aquino allows her deposed
predecessor to return from Hawaiian exile for the funeral.
   There's no indication the 95-year-old woman's body will be
buried anytime soon.
   Jesus Nalupta, mayor of this town of about 40,000 people that is
250 miles north of Manila, said today that the municipal council
declared the day of mourning because ``everybody is still
grieving.''
   But he said no special ceremonies were scheduled apart from
Roman Catholic Masses, which have been said nearly every day since
Mrs. Edralin-Marcos' body was brought last year from Manila, where
she died.
   Her body has been lying in an open casket in the Marcos
ancestral home, which has been turned into a museum.
   The wake has attracted an unusual assortment of Marcos
supporters, tourists, curiosity-seekers and a cult of religious
fanatics, who believe Marcos is ``the second son of God.''
   Mrs. Aquino has cited national security in refusing to allow
Marcos to return from Hawaii, where he has lived since he was
ousted in a popular uprising three years ago.
   Marcos has been hospitalized since January with heart and
bronchial ailments, and his followers say he is dying.
   Nalupta and many others here in Marcos' home province of Ilocos
Norte believe the former president should be allowed to return,
both to bury his mother and die in his homeland.
   ``We have given up all hopes that the Aquino government would
allow Marcos to come home,'' said Congressman Mariano Nalupta, a
brother of the mayor. ``We have given it to the will of God.''
   Frank Malabed, the Marcos family's mortician, said it has cost
the former president's family about $950 a month to continue the
wake, including charges for flowers, embalming supplies and changes
in clothing.
   Malabed said he inspects the body periodically and adds more
embalming fluid every two months. He said the lengthy, highly
publicized wake has been great for his business.

<HEAD>Scientist Use Poems, Visuals to Illustrate Cold Fusion Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicists are resorting to poems and visual
aids like a blade of grass to help illustrate the problems they
found in two chemists' claim of achieving nuclear fusion in a jar.
   ``Tens of millions of dollars are at stake, dear sister and
brother, because one scientist put a thermometer in one place
instead of the other,'' Walter Meyerhof of Stanford University
recited to reporters Tuesday at a meeting of the American Physical
Society.
   Meyerhof said the excess heat that the researchers attribute to
cold fusion was caused instead by incorrect temperature
measurements. He said the device the researchers used failed to
distribute temperature evenly.
   University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons and his collaborator,
Martin Fleischmann of Britain's University of Southampton, startled
the world March 23 by announcing they had achieved fusion at room
temperature.
   Most efforts to achieve fusion, the nuclear reaction that powers
the sun, have required staggeringly high temperatures. Cold fusion
could open the door to a clean, cheap and virtually unlimited
source of energy.
   Pons and Fleischmann said they did it by placing palladium and
platinum electrodes in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy water,
and applying electric current. Deuterium is a heavier isotope, or
cousin, of ordinary hydrogen.
   The researchers claimed the nuclei of the deuterium atoms fused,
releasing neutrons and producing four times more heat than invested.
   But in an informal show of hands, the scientists on a panel at
the American Physical Society meeting Tuesday voted 8-1 that they
were 95 percent confident the excess heat was not produced by
nuclear fusion.
   However, the panel also voted 6-3 against ruling out that
experiments in Utah and elsewhere had produced neutrons.
   ``The bottom line is we see nothing anomalous in any of their
experiments and have identified what we believe are serious errors
in the experiment,'' said Steven Koonin of the California Institute
of Technology.
   Koonin was part of a three-member Caltech team that tried to
duplicate the Utah experiments.
   Fred Skiff, a University of Maryland physicist, said that after
attempting to duplicate the results for two weeks he was certain
cold fusion had not taken place.
   ``It appears the work by Pons and Fleischmann is very sloppy,''
Skiff said. ``They should have presented their research in the
scientific community before going public with it,'' he said. ``The
public debate on this matter makes science look bad because of the
complicated process of verification.''
   One of the few physicists to hold out hope for cold fusion,
Brigham Young University's Steve Jones, said his experiments had
produced neutrons but at a level much lower than the University of
Utah experiment claimed. Cold fusion needs further study, but is
only a little understood effect, he said.
   He used a blade of grass to illustrate his point.
   ``I don't think it will grow into a tree,'' Jones said. ``I
think it will grow into a pleasant little flower in the garden of
physics.''
   Pons and Fleishmann have not responded in detail to this week's
criticism in Baltimore.
   But Pons did say: ``The absence of neutrons does not concern us
in the slightest. We couldn't be happier. We and other scientists
will soon tell them why this is so.''
   University of Utah officials also defended the research.
   ``It's difficult for me to believe people of Pons' and
Fleischmann's caliber could forget to put a thermometer in the
right place or something basic like stirring,'' said John Brophy,
the university's vice president for research. ``It doesn't shake my
confidence. It's never nice to be criticized. However, when you're
out in front, the wind can be cool sometimes.''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms in Texas, Chilly Morning In Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms moved across northern Texas today, dumping heavy
rain and hail, while Midwesterners awoke to another chilly morning.
   The most severe thunderstorms were near Ranger, Texas, where
funnel clouds were spotted Tuesday night. The town is about 70
miles southwest of Fort Worth.
   Baseball-sized hail fell near the town, the National Weather
Service said.
   Heavy wind blew over two semi-trailer trucks on Interstate 20
near Ranger, authorities said.
   Also in Texas, thunderstorm winds destroyed a barn in northern
Parker County, tore off a roof of a country club and overturned
several mobile homes in Comanche County. Winds were recorded up to
80 mph.
   Thunderstorms also were over southern Arkansas and central
Mississippi.
   Rain showers developed from Montana to central Colorado, and
showers fell over the lower Great Lakes region.
   Waco, Texas, had more than an inch of rain in the six hours
ending at 2 a.m. EDT, while Limestone, Maine, and Cleveland each
recorded nearly two-thirds of an inch in the same period.
   A high pressure system with a cold air mass was centered over
northern Missouri, creating chilly temperatures from the upper and
middle Mississippi Valley across the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley to the Appalachians.
   North Carolina's northern mountains had a frost warning today.
   The high temperature in the nation Tuesday was 102 in two
California communities _ Borrego Springs and Palm Springs.
   Today's forecast: showers and thunderstorms extending from the
lower Mississippi and lower Tennessee valleys across Oklahoma, the
central Plains, and western portions of the northern Plains to the
northern and central Rockies; showers from New England to western
Pennsylvania; snow showers in the higher elevations of western New
York and western Pennsylvania, where high temperatures were
expected in the 40s.
   Elsewhere, high temperatures were to be in the 50s from Michigan
to the northern and central Appalachians, and over Montana; in the
80s over Florida, Louisiana, much of Texas, New Mexico, central
Arizona and interior California; and in the 90s to near 100 over
southwest Texas and the desert Southwest. Much of the rest of the
nation was to have high temperatures in the 60s and 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29
degrees in Marquette, Mich., to 81 degrees in Glendale, Ariz.

<HEAD>Delta Found Not At Fault in Flight 191 Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first verdict dealing with
the carrier's liability, a jury cleared Delta Air Lines in the 1985
crash of Flight 191 that killed 137 people at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport.
   A federal jury decided Tuesday that the carrier wasn't
responsible for the crash because the plane's crew was unaware of
deadly wind shear before landing.
   ``This confirms our belief that neither Delta nor its pilots
caused the accident and shows that the pilots were not aware of the
dangerous storm they were flying into,'' the Atlanta-based airline
said in a statement.
   Other juries around the nation have ordered damage awards to
Flight 191's survivors and families of some of the 137 people who
died in the crash, but only the value of lives, not the question of
liability, was at issue.
   The suit that led to Tuesday's judgment was brought by the
family of Sidney Bernstein, 40, of Fort Lauderdale, who was killed
when the Lockheed L-1011 jet, en route from Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to Los Angeles, crashed
during a violent thunderstorm on Aug. 2, 1985.
   For Delta, the verdict strengthened its hopes in other cases
pending nationwide that are trying to establish that the company
was at fault.
   Tuesday's verdict also could affect a lawsuit brought by Delta
in Fort Worth against the federal government.
   Delta has claimed in its suit that meteorologists and
air-traffic controllers failed to inform the crew of the worsening
weather and wants the government to pay all or part of the claims
facing the airline.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has blamed the crash on
a microburst, a violent downward blast of air often associated with
severe thunderstorms.
   The non-jury trial in Fort Worth ended last week. U.S. District
Judge David Belew has said he may not rule for months on who was to
blame for the crash.
   Delta and its insurance companies already have paid more than
$66 million in death, injury and damage claims from the Flight 191
crash, and the total is expected to exceed $100 million.
   In those cases, survivors who brought lawsuits against Delta and
its insurance companies have waived the question of liability.
   Bernstein's family wanted Delta to admit responsibility for the
crash and to pay damages to the family for lost wages he would have
provided had he lived. The jury's verdict resulted in no damages
being awarded.
   The family's attorney, Stephen Walker, argued during the trial
that the plane's pilot ``willfully and intentionally'' flew into
the thunderstorm that caused the crash.
   But Delta attorney Howard Barwick said key evidence in the trial
came from a private pilot who landed at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport seconds before the Delta jet crashed.
   ``He said he was trapped and he had no indication of the
conditions he was flying into,'' Barwick said. ``The flight crews
were completely taken by surprise. I think the jury agreed with us,
that Delta and its crew were victims just like Mr. Bernstein.''

<HEAD>Emigration Highest Since 1979, But Less Bound for Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union in April
soared to its highest level in 10 years, according to figures
released today by an agency that helps to resettle the emigrants.
   However, the share of those bound for Israel fell to a new low.
   Regina Boucault, spokeswoman of the Geneva-based
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, said 4,129 Jews arrived
at the Vienna transit center from the Soviet Union in April,
compared with 3,893 in March.
   Only 87 of them, or 2.1 percent, said they wanted to go to
Israel. Most were heading for the United States, said Ms. Boucault.
   Last year the share of Soviet Jews bound for Israel was still
7.1 percent. In 1987, before the Palestinian uprising in the West
Bank and the Gaza strip it was as high as 24.4 percent.
   Since the beginning of 1989, 12,864 Jews have left the Soviet
Union, according to ICM figures.
   On Tuesday, the Washington-based National Conference on Soviet
Jewry reported an emigration total of 4,557 Jews for April. The ICM
figures only account for those Soviet Jews who pass through Vienna.
   The program for Jewish emigration from Soviet Union began in
1971 and reached a peak in 1979 when 51,328 were allowed to leave
the country. This dropped sharply when Soviet intervention in
Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.

<TEXT>
   Disagreement over a
multibillion-dollar plan to clean up the country's environment has
brought down the 7-year-old center-right government of Prime
Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   The Christian Democrat on Tuesday announced the resignation of
his Cabinet after a right-wing junior partner objected to his
proposal to end $325 million in income tax deductions for people
who drive their cars to work.
   Political observers predicted Lubbers would form a coalition
with the Dutch Labor Party, second only to the Christian Democrats
in the number of parliamentary seats it holds.
   Lubbers' action headed off a possible motion of no confidence
threatened by the junior coalition partner, the People's Party for
Freedom and Democracy.
   ``Environmental policy certainly needs to be paid for, but why
just by those who live at some distance from their jobs?'' said
Joris Voorhoeve, the right-wing party's leader in the 150-seat
Parliament.
   Lubbers' announcement came at the end of a tense 7{-hour
parliamentary debate on a $3.65 billion government plan to cut
pollution of the country's atmosphere to 30 percent of current
levels by the year 2010.
   ``If only we could motivate one in ten (car-driving commuters)
to change their habits ... that would have a very large effect on
the congestion, on mobility, on the environment,'' Lubbers said.
   The crisis also reflected years of irritation among Voorhoeve's
party at steadily losing decision-making power to the charismatic
Lubbers, who enjoys immense popularity in this nation of 14.6
million people.
   The 49-year-old prime minister said he planned to meet with
Queen Beatrix today ``to offer the resignation of all the
ministers'' in the Cabinet.
   In Dutch constitutional practice, the government will continue
in office with caretaker status until early elections later this
year. After the elections, it can take several months until a new
government is formed.
   Parliamentary elections had been scheduled for May 1990.
   The Christian Democrats have been in virtually every postwar
Dutch government and are likely to be the centerpiece of the next
one.
   Never in postwar Dutch history has a political party garnered
sufficient votes to govern alone.
   The 8-year-old Lubbers government has aimed to cut the $13
billion budget deficit and 11 percent unemployment rate.
   In recent months, the People's Party has accused Lubbers' party
of backing off from a pledge to cut corporate and private taxes and
slash social security, education and health care outlays.
   But the issue that prompted the government's resignation was a
Lubbers proposal to end the tax break for car-driving commuters in
a bid to reduce car exhaust fumes and highway congestion by forcing
motorists to take mass transit. Voorhoeve also objected to a
proposed $270 million increase in the tax on diesel fuel that would
mainly hit the trucking industry, one of the mainstays of the Dutch
economy.
   Under the anti-pollution plan, farmers also would have to pay
toward cleaning up deposits of manure produced by their livestock,
deposits that contribute to acid rain.
   The plan would set levies for polluting industries and contain
proposals for cleaning up hundreds of toxic waste dumps.
   Voorhoeve's move to topple the government had the support of the
52-seat Labor Party opposition, and the 54 Christian Democrats
would not have been able to hold off a no-confidence vote.
   The People's Party has 27 seats in Parliament, while 12 seats
are held by three opposition parties and five seats by three
right-wing parties that are generally supportive of the government.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Sets Conditions to Return to Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If the Vietnamese troop pullout from
Cambodia is independently confirmed and the constitution rewritten
to his satisfaction, Prince Norodom Sihanouk says he will return
home as head of state.
   Sihanouk, leader of the guerrilla coalition resisting the
Vietnamese-backed government, said today that he expects to decide
before November if his conditions have been met.
   He made the comments at a news conference on the second day of
peace talks in Jakarta.
   An international commission, to be named at a conference in
Paris on July 24-25, must first make sure the Vietnamese withdrawal
is genuine, Sihanouk said. Hanoi has promised to pull out its
remaining troops by Sept. 30.
   Sihanouk's other demands include a four-party interim government
in Phnom Penh until elections can be held, and constitutional
guarantees for a multiparty political system.
   The proposed interim administration would include the present
Cambodian government of Premier Hun Sen, Sihanouk's non-communist
followers, anti-communists from former Premier Son Sann's Khmer
People's National Liberation Front and the Communist Khmer Rouge.
   Hun Sen has been trying to persuade Sihanouk to abandon the
Khmer Rouge and return home as head of the the government he headed
until being ousted in 1970.
   The Khmer Rouge, which came to power in 1975 and was forced out
by the invading Vietnamese in 1978, is not represented at the
talks. Sihanouk said no support could be expected from them
following the Jakarta talks.
   ``The Khmer Rouge will reject everything because they are
interested in the continuation of the war,'' he said.
   The fanatical Khmer Rouge is accused of killing hundreds of
thousands of people during its bloody reign. Hun Sen, Sihanouk and
their allies insist that Pol Pot and other leaders of the original
``genocidal clique'' be barred from any future government.
   The Khmer Rouge, the largest Cambodian guerrilla group, today
rejected any conciliatory moves by the Vietnamese-installed
government, saying they should be thrown ``into the dustbin.''
   The Khmer Rouge radio was commenting on the constitutional
amendments the pro-Vietnamese government adopted Sunday.
   In concessions to Sihanouk, Hun Sen had changed the country's
name from People's Republic of Kampuchea to the State of Cambodia,
as well as changed its flag and anthem and promised several changes
to the constitution.
   These are merely part of efforts to legitimize the regime, the
Khmer Rouge broadcast said. A text of Tuesday's broadcast was
obtained today in Bangkok.
   The radio complained that the government had changed its outer
shell but ``the true nature remains a Vietnamese puppet, socialist
regime.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Tuesday that close ties with a future Cambodian government
would not be possible if it were heavily influenced by the Khmer
Rouge.
   Sihanouk said the Sino-Soviet summit in Beijing in mid-May
should be beneficial to his cause.
   He said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``may put some
moral pressure on Hun Sen'' and the Chinese leadership might apply
pressure on the Khmer Rouge to seek a settlement in the 10-year-old
conflict.
   China is the primary military backer of the Khmer Rouge.

<HEAD>Pope Visits Depressed Mining Region Of Zambia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KITWE, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II traveled today to the
depressed Copperbelt mining region of central Zambia, one of
Africa's poorest and most indebted nations.
   The pope conducted a two-hour, open-air Mass at an abandoned
airport at Kitwe, the second-largest city in this southern African
nation of 7.5 million people, three-fourths of whom are Christian.
   In the near distance, behind the Papal podium, smoke stacks at a
copper smelting plant billowed black smoke into clear tropical
skies.
   Church choirs sang hymns to the throb of African tribal drums as
the pontiff, in an open ``popemobile'' rode through a crowd of
100,000 pilgrims.
   A hymn, written for the Mass in the local Bemba dialect,
described the pope as ``our hero.'' With arms outstretched, John
Paul blessed groups of women chanting and ululating, a traditional
means of expressing joy.
   John Paul, his face reddened by the tropical sun, paid tribute
to white priests who set up the first Roman Catholic missions in
Zambia nearly 100 years ago. Today, there are 1.7 million Catholics
in Zambia.
   Tens of thousands of pilgrims, mainly from northern districts of
this nation, waved yellow-and-white Vatican flags and wore
sari-like cloths emblazoned with John Paul's portrait.
   Bishop Dennis de Jong of the Copperbelt diocese of Ndola that
covers Kitwe said in a brief welcoming statement that the pope is
visiting the mining region at a time of economic hardships.
   The fall in world copper prices left Zambia with ``an enormous
national debt,'' severe unemployment and social problems, he said.
   Copper prices slumped in the 1970s. Current foreign debt of $5
billion drains about two-fifths of all export income, 90 percent of
which is derived from sales of copper.
   On his arrival in Lusaka, Zambia on Tuesday, John Paul lashed
out at white-ruled South Africa's system of apartheid or racial
separation, describing it as an unacceptable system.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, in his welcoming speech, also
assailed apartheid and said the pope's visit would strengthen
Zambia's resolve to work for peace in southern Africa ``in a spirit
of dialogue and reconciliation and not confrontation.''
   Kaunda, 65, is chairman of the African Frontline States, a
grouping of six black countries spearheading efforts to end
apartheid.
   Leaders of the African National Congress, the main
guerrilla-backed movement fighting South Africa's government, have
said they would like to meet the pope while he is in Lusaka, the
ANC's external headquarters.
   Vatican officials said no talks were planned, but they did not
rule out the prospect of an informal meeting.
   The pope is on the third leg of a four-nation tour of African
and Indian Ocean states. He leaves Zambia on Thursday for
neighboring Malawi.

<TEXT>
   Colleagues of slain
anti-apartheid activist David Webster today offered a reward for
the arrest of his killers and advised police officials to look
within their own ranks for suspects.
   Webster, a university lecturer and outspoken critic of the
government's policy of detention without trial, was shot outside
his home Monday by an assailant in a passing car who fired a
shotgun from close range.
   Also today, six mortar bombs were fired at an army radar
installation near the border with Botswana, damaging living
quarters but causing no injuries.
   Regarding Webster, police have released sketches of three
unidentified white men suspected of involvement in the killing and
have offered a $4,000 reward for information leading to arrests.
   Today, the University of the Witwatersand, where Webster taught
anthropology, offered an additional $4,000 reward. Robert
Charleton, the chief administrator of the multiracial university,
said it was ``deeply disquieting'' that police had made no arrests
in connection with a series of previous attacks and vandalism aimed
at staff and students.
   Anti-apartheid activists who worked with Webster announced at a
news conference that his funeral would held Saturday.
   Max Coleman, a prominent human rights advocate, called for an
investigation into the possible existence of death squads formed to
kill government opponents.
   ``There may be no more profitable place to start such an
investigation than within the ranks of the police themselves,''
Coleman said. ``This is the body which has the expertise, the
information and the wherewithal to carry out such acts so
professionally.''
   Mohammed Valli Moosa, a leader of the banned United Democratic
Front anti-apartheid coalition, told the news conference that
Webster ``was a very carefully chosen target.''
   ``His cold-blooded murder is meant to serve as a warning to the
increasing numbers of whites who are daring to associate themselves
in word and deed with the oppressed people of this country,'' Valli
Moosa said. ``We fear that more and more of our leaders are going
to be assassinated.''
   ``The ordinary people of this country have a strong suspicion
that Comrade Webster's assassin is a member of the police force,''
he added.
   Webster was an authority on the tactics used legally and
illegally to repress or intimidate government opponents. He
recently completed an article discussing unsolved abductions and
assassinations of anti-apartheid activists.
   Numerous black activists have been slain in recent years. Many
white activists have received anonymous threats or have been
harassed but few have been attacked since the unsolved 1978 killing
of Rick Turner, a political scientist at the University of Natal.
   In north-central South Africa, security forces set off a land
mine while trying to catch those who fired the mortar bombs at the
radar installation, but the detonation of the mine caused no
injuries, the military said.
   It said the radar installation was near Mafikeng near the
Botswana border.
   There was no immediate indication who was responsible.
   There have been few attacks on army bases, and very few mortar
bombardments during the 28-year-old guerrilla campaign waged by the
outlawed African National Congress. South African officials have
contended that ANC guerrillas often infiltrate from Botswana to
carry out bombing and sabotage missions.

<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's
representative to Lebanon remained in a coma today but was reported
in stable condition a day after being shot in the head by a masked
gunman.
   Another guerrilla from Arafat's mainline Fatah faction was
killed today as he drove his motorcycle down a main street in
Sidon. Bassam Hourani, 30, ``died instantly from several shot
wounds in the head and chest,'' said a police spokesman. The gunman
escaped.
   A spokesman at Hammoud Hospital said Arafat's representative,
48-year-old Issam Salem, survived a five-hour operation to remove a
bullet that pierced the left side of his forehead in an
assassination attempt Tuesday.
   ``The operation was a success. Mr. Salem is in stable condition
but still in coma. However, we won't know if we can take him off
the critical list for at least 48 hours,'' the spokesman said. He
declined to be named.
   Salem was the second high-ranking PLO official to become the
target of an assassination attempt in Sidon within four days.
   Police said a lone assailant, wearing a plastic mask and armed
with a 9mm pistol, fired two bullets into Salem's head and shoulder
at a gift store in this port city's Fakhreddin Street.
   The gunman escaped through narrow alleyways leading to the
Palestinian refugee camp of Ein El-Hilweh on Sidon's southern
flank, according to police.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization security department and
the Nasserite leftist Moslem militia that governs Sidon said they
launched a joint hunt for the gunman. But spokesmen for both groups
said no arrests were made.
   There was no claim of responsibility for the attempt against
Salem or the rocket-propelled grenade attack Saturday on the house
of Zeid Wehbi, the PLO spokesman in Sidon.
   Arafat, on an official visit in France, called the attack on
Salem ``a message for us to put up our hands and stop helping our
Lebanese brothers.''
   That was interpreted by Christian-controlled radio stations in
Beirut as an accusation against Syria, whose forces have been
locked in heavy artillery duels with Christian units of the
Lebanese army in the past seven weeks.
   Wehbi, however, blamed Israel's secret service.
   He told reporters the attack was designed to ``deal a blow to
Lebanese-Palestinian coexistence in the Sidon region.''
   Wehbi charged Israel is launching ``a wave of assassination
attempts against our brethren.''
   Arafat, a staunch foe of Syrian President Hafez Assad, had
declared support for the Christians in the latest round of
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war that has claimed almost 300 lives.
   But Arafat's estimated 5,000 guerrillas who have returned to the
Sidon region after his evacuation from Lebanon during Israel's 1982
invasion have taken no active part in the fighting.
   Sidon, Lebanon's third largest city 25 miles south of Beirut, is
the PLO's main power base in Lebanon.

   A woman has charged Grand Ole Opry star
Bill Monroe with assault and battery, alleging the 77-year-old
entertainer hit her with a Bible, knocked her down and kicked her.
   Wanda Huff, of Birmingham, Ala., filed a criminal complaint in
Sumner County General Sessions Court on Monday.
   Monroe, known as the ``father of bluegrass music,'' was released
on his own recognizance pending a preliminary hearing next
Wednesday.
   Ms. Huff alleged that Monroe struck her when she went to his
farm to recover property that belonged to her, according to a court
complaint.
   ``While she (Ms. Huff) was there, defendant Monroe became angry,
hit her in the face with a Bible, knocked her down, kicked her in
the face,'' the complaint said.
   Tony Conway, an executive at Music Row's Buddy Lee Attractions,
which handles bookings for Monroe, said the singer told him that
Ms. Huff started destroying property at his house.
   ``He asked her to leave several times and she refused to
leave,'' Conway said. ``Mr. Monroe called the police, the police
came to the house, took statements from both parties, and I guess
she filed charges against him.
   ``He did state that he's totally shocked and that he's never
been arrested for anything in his life.''
   Sumner County Chief Deputy J.D. Vandercook said that Monroe
called officers to his home.
   ``Any citizen of Sumner County or of the United States has the
right to obtain a warrant,'' Vandercook said. ``Her testimony will
have to be weighed against his in General Sessions Court.''
   Reached at her home, Ms. Huff said she has known Monroe ``a
pretty good while. ... He's a wonderful musician and a wonderful
songwriter, but he's got a mean streak down his back.''
   No one answered a telephone call to Monroe's office this morning.
   Monroe won a Grammy award this year for ``Southern Flavor,''
under the first-time bluegrass music category. He is a member of
the Country Music Hall of Fame and has played at the Opry for 50
years.

   About 200 young people attacked stores and
restaurants following May Day celebrations in the Central Asia
republic of Turkmenia, and police arrested 100 of them to end the
rampage, Pravda said today.
   ``Those who were detained said they acted because of exorbitant
prices of cooperatives and the low quality of products and
services,'' Pravda said. ``But as a method of protest, as was seen,
they chose hooliganism.''
   About 200 young people gathered in Ashkabad, the capital of
Turkmenia, on Monday evening after May Day celebrations and began
attacking stores, parks and restaurants. They broke glass and
damaged some cars, Pravda said. Turkmenia is a southern Soviet
republic bordering the Caspian Sea, Iran and Afghanistan.
   The crowd was led by criminals, the Communist Party newspaper
charged. Police resorted to force after the youths ignored an order
to disperse. ``Not less than 100 lawbreakers were detained, and no
one was hurt,'' Pravda said.
   It quoted Interior Minister Vasily Grinin of Turkmenia as saying
that police had heard rumors there would be trouble but that they
managed to break it up without using tear gas or truncheons.
   The paper's specific reference to tear gas and truncheons
apparently was intended to assure readers that there was no repeat
of the violent clash between demonstrators and soldiers in the
Georgian republic on April 9.
   Soldiers there waded into a crowd of pro-independence
demonstrators with clubs and shovels, and used gas to disperse
them. Nineteen people were killed and one more young man was shot
to death later for violating curfew.
   There have been no reports of any previous such trouble in
Turkmenia, a republic of 3.5 million people, the most sparsely
populated of the five traditionally Moslem Central Asian republics.
There have been reports of religious and civil unrest in
neighboring Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   Pravda said Ashkabad has remained quite since the unrest was
quelled.
   Cooperatives are the small, privately-owned businesses permitted
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms to provide
goods and services the state-run economy cannot.
   Although the cooperatives are still only a fraction of the
official economy, many Soviets view them with suspicion, believing
their operators are interested only in a quick profit and that they
take materials out of the state-run economy. Soviet consumers are
being squeezed by shortages of consumer goods and food items and by
inflation.

   A Palestinian shouting ``God is great'' stabbed
to death two elderly Israelis waiting at a bus stop in downtown
Jerusalem today, police said. Three other Israelis were seriously
injured in the attack.
   Dozens of angry passers-by chased the short, stocky assailant
about 30 yards and caught him after a brief struggle. Police pinned
the Arab to the ground in a nearby flower shop to protect him from
the crowd.
   Police said the man, a 25-year-old resident of the West Bank
town of Ramallah, acted alone. Israel radio said the attacker was a
former member of a Moslem fundamentalist group, and police said he
had been questioned about unspecified ``terrorist activities'' in
the past.
   The attack came one day after PLO leader Yasser Arafat disavowed
the 25-year-old PLO charter, which calls for the destruction of
Israel. His announcement in Paris prompted protests from radical
Palestinian factions.
   The stabbings further escalated Arab-Jewish tensions in
Jerusalem, already at a breaking point after 17 months of
Palestinian rebellion against Israeli rule in the occupied lands.
Nearly 460 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have been killed since the
uprising began in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The stabbings occurred around 11 a.m. across from Jerusalem's
main post office on Jaffa Road, the main shopping street in Jewish
west Jerusalem.
   Police reinforcements, including mounted horse patrols, rushed
to the scene to control groups of angry Israelis who shouted
``Death to the terrorists!'' and ``Death to the Arabs!''
   About three hours after the stabbing, police fired tear gas to
disperse dozens of followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane's anti-Arab Kach
Party who shouted ``revenge, revenge.'' The group was en route to
the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, to stage a protest when
it was halted by police.
   Kahane, who is from Brooklyn, N.Y., and who founded the Jewish
Defense League in the United States, was arrested along with six of
his followers. They were charged with disturbing public order.
   Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev urged restraint. ``I hope it won't
prompt extremists from our side to react because that could bring
about a vicious cycle,'' Bar-Lev said on Israel radio.
   Romi Shimon, who was sitting in a Jaffa Road restaurant, said
the assailant was shouting ``God is Great'' when he attacked five
Israelis at the bus stop, four of them elderly. ``He was going
crazy and started stabbing people. We caught him at the end of the
street,'' Shimon told Israel radio.
   Sima Ozer, an employee in the Newman Flower Shop across from the
post office on Jaffa Road, said the short, stocky Arab was carrying
a blood-covered eight-inch knife as he was being chased.
   ``Then a policeman came and stopped the crowd from lynching
him,'' she said. ``Police threw him on the floor of the flower shop
... while people outside were shouting `kill him, kill him, death
to the Arabs.'''
   At one point during the chase, she said she heard a gun shot. A
reporter saw blood on the floor of the flower shop.
   Minutes later, the crowd chased a Palestinian teen-ager wearing
a white kaffiyeh headdress. Two policemen whisked him away to
safety.
   Vardi Kalman, 60, was taken to a nearby souvenir shop where he
later died of his wounds. Hundreds of onlookers crowded the shop
entrance, and the body, wrapped in a white sheet, was carried to an
ambulance.
   Nissim Levy, 91, died of wounds at Hadassah Hospital which was
also treating a woman in her 90s. Bikur Holim Hospital reported
treating two men, one 64 and the other a 25-year-old Jewish
seminary student, for stab wounds in the stomach and chest.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss said the assailant appeared to
have no accomplices.
   Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said the assailant had spent the
night praying at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque to mark Leilat al Kadr,
the night the Moslem holy book Koran was received by the Prophet
Mohammed. He said the man had a record of being detained and
questioned about anti-Israeli acts in the past.
   Police did not say if the attacker operated under orders from a
group or initiated the attack on his own.
   The army sealed the assailant's hometown, Ramallah, setting up
roadblocks on main roads, Arab reporters said. Troops detained
dozens of Palestinian youths after ordering them off buses and
taxis, they said.
   Arafat's announcement in Paris on Tuesday prompted immediate
protests from radical Palestinians, including the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine of George Habash. Slogans
painted on walls in the West Bank town of Nablus said, ``Down with
the betrayer Arafat.'' Last year, the United States opened talks
with the PLO after Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist.

   A man has been charged with beating to
death a 3{-year-old boy who police say lived ``a life of torture''
from almost daily physical abuse.
   A relative and two neighbors witnessed some of the abuse but
none contacted authorities, The Boston Globe reported in today's
editions.
   Neighbors and police said Randolph Scott, 38, beat the boy,
Hanif Sutton, with his fists, a belt or sneakers and forced the
child to stand in the bathroom for long periods in uncomfortable
positions.
   Scott was being held without bail in East Cambridge Jail today
on charges of first-degree murder, five counts of assault and
battery and one count of deriving support from a prostitute.
   Police said the abuse culminated in a beating Saturday. On
Monday, Hanif died at Children's Hospital in Boston of trauma to
the head. When he was admitted to the hospital on Saturday, he was
suffering swelling and bleeding of the brain, a ruptured spleen and
bruises, said John McEvoy, a Middlesex County assistant district
attorney.
   ``The baby was leading a life of torture,'' said Police Capt.
John Cullen.
   Cullen said Scott is a heroin addict whose habit was supported
by the boy's mother, Rosalyn Rochester, through prostitution. ``She
kept nothing for herself and nothing for the baby,'' Cullen said.
   A social worker from the state Department of Social Services
regularly visited the apartment where the boy lived. A spokeswoman,
Lorraine Carli, said the agency was concerned about neglect but was
unaware of any abuse of the boy. ``This is very frightening to us.
It is an unexpected, unpredictable explosion of violence,'' she
said.
   John Rivera, a neighbor living downstairs from Ms. Rochester and
her son, told the Globe, ``It goes back for months. He beat the kid
every day. I could hear the kid screaming and fighting.
   ``My old lady said tey were just wrestling, but when you wrestle
with a kid there is laughing and giggling. I never heard laughing.
I feel bad I never called someone ... but (Scott) was into dope and
I didn't want to get into trouble,'' Rivera said.
   Another neighbor, Brenda Martin, said Hanif was often beaten for
urinating in his pants, and an unnamed relative of Scott's said she

   Space shuttle technicians closed up
the engine compartment today as the countdown advanced smoothly
toward Thursday's scheduled launch of Atlantis with five astronauts.
   NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said the launch team completed
certification of two replacement parts in the fuel system and other
components and reinstalled access panels on the engine compartment.
   Also under way today was a check of the shuttle communications
system.
   ``We're humming right along,'' she said.
   ``This time we're going to see if we can get it right,''
astronaut David Walker, who will command the flight, said Tuesday.
Four days earlier, a launch attempt was called off just 31 seconds
before the planned liftoff.
   ``Looks like the vehicle's been turned around real well,''
Walker told reporters. ``We're extremely pleased the folks here at
the cape were able to do such a good and quick job getting it ready
to go again.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:48 p.m. Thursday.
   ``There are no major issues in sight,'' Robert Crippen, NASA's
deputy director of operations, said after a mission management
meeting Tuesday. ``We're pressing on.''
   Shuttle weather forecasters said there was a 70 percent chance
conditions would be favorable. The only concern was a threat of
crosswinds greater than 17 mph that could be dangerous if the
shuttle had to make an emergency landing on a runway near the
launch pad.
   Atlantis will carry into space the $550 million Magellan probe,
which the astronauts are to dispatch on a 15-month journey to
Venus. The probe is to orbit the planet and map its cloud-shrouded
surface with a high resolution radar system.
   The launch attempt was halted on Friday because of a short
circuit in a fuel pump.
   Technicians working around the clock replaced the pump and a
suspect fuel line in half the time expected.
   Engineers thought there was a leak in the fuel line, but tests
turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud seen spewing from the
line, thought to be gas, might have been trapped air.
   Ronald Phelps, a shuttle test director, said the new countdown,
which started Tuesday, was compressed from three days to two by
eliminating some ``hold time'' that is built into the countdown in
case of problems and by not repeating some tasks completed in the
first attempt.

   Sixty-three years after his death,
legendary escape artist Harry Houdini pulled off another one.
   He eluded efforts by magic lovers to contact him through a
seance conducted by Kreskin, an entertainer who says he has special
powers of mental telepathy.
   Locks jiggled and hands of seance sitters quivered Tuesday, but
neither Houdini nor his wife, Beatrice, spoke to the 25 people at
the American Museum of Magic hoping to hear from them.
   Despite about 30 minutes of hand-holding, nobody reported
hearing anything from either Houdini.
   ``Scientifically, we really have no evidence that we
communicated with the spirit world,'' said Kreskin.
   But Kreskin said he will try to remedy that in the future by
offering $1 million to anyone who can pass a test designed to
provide evidence of psychic phenomena.
   Museum owner Robert Lund, who organized the seance, said he had
hoped to get through to Houdini by first reaching Houdini's wife,
whom Houdini had promised to contact from the grave.
   Houdini died Oct. 31, 1926, in Detroit after his appendix
ruptured. His wife died in 1943.
   Nine people, including a retired judge and an assistant fire
chief, sat expectantly amid Houdini mementos _ photos of Houdini
and his wife, a will written by Mrs. Houdini on the train back to
New York with her husband's body and a large metal milk can from
which Houdini escaped during his act.
   A large poster of Houdini, dating to 1911, hung above their
heads.
   They closed their eyes, held hands and turned their palms up as
Kreskin slowly counted to 20 and urged them to think about Mrs.
Houdini.
   ``We're waiting for some sign, but that sign can be within us as
well as outside of us,'' he said, adding the signs could be shaking
hands or feeling a breeze.
   One woman said her left hand went numb, another woman felt cool
and a third said she felt hot. One man's hand shook, and a padlock
on Houdini's metal can jiggled.
   Kreskin and Lund had promised no trickery, but skeptics in the
audience contended the padlock jiggled only because the wooden
platform on which it was placed was unstable.
   Such physical reactions are unprovable and could be the result
of suggestion, Kreskin said.
   ``Darn it ... there is no way on the face of the earth of
proving spiritualistic phenomena,'' he said.
   Still, Lund expressed no disappointment.
   ``It was successful in terms of getting a lot of press attention
and people here. Whether it was successful in contacting Mrs.
Houdini, I don't know that we contacted Mrs. Houdini,'' Lund said.
   One thing he is sure of: Houdini would have liked it.
   ``I think he would have turned to (showman) George M. Cohan and
said, `Say, I really pulled it off, George. Do you think you could
do as well?''' Lund said.

   American education is stagnating by nearly
every measure in a new comparison of school performance across the
country, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said today in releasing
the discouraging report card.
   The sixth annual State Education Performance Chart shows a
decline in the national high school graduation rate and falling
scores on college entrance exams in half the states.
   ``We must do better. We must revitalize education in America''
by setting targets for improvement, Cavazos said in a statement
accompanying the report.
   ``We have not made any progress in the last three years,''
Cavazos elaborated in an interview on NBC's ``Today'' program.
``It's hard to say why. I still believe that we have not focused on
the fundamental issues of trying to get everybody involved in the
education of children. It's not a matter of dollars.''
   ``I'm going to write to every governor, to every school board
president, I'm going to communicate with the leaders, the
superintendents and all the people out there and say we must issue
a challenge'' to improve the schools, Cavazos said.
   Performance targets include boosting high school graduation
rates to 90 percent and cutting in half the number of children who
fail a grade.
   ``Today about 3,600 students will drop out of school ... I think
it's a disaster that we must turn around,'' Cavazos said.
   The performance chart, known as the ``wall chart,'' shows a
general lack of progress despite the continuing spate of reform
efforts and ever-rising education spending _ up to $3,977 per
student on this year's chart compared to $3,756 last year.
   National scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) fell from
906 to 904 (on a scale of 400 to 1,600) from 1987 to 1988. Fully 14
of the 22 states in which the SAT is the dominant college entrance
exam registered declines.
   Scores on the American College Testing Program (ACT), on a scale
of 1 to 36, showed a scant .1-point gain. And 11 of the 28 states
in which the ACT dominates posted decreases.
   Looking at trends since the first wall chart was issued in 1982,
one bright note was a continuous rise in the percentage of students
taking the Advanced Placement test qualifying them for college
credit, from 5 to 11 percent. The department attributed the climb
largely to doubled Hispanic involvement and an 83 percent increase
in participation by blacks.
   The high school graduation rate rose from 69.5 percent in the
first chart to 71.7 percent in 1985. But it fell slightly in 1986
to 71.6 percent and dropped to 71.1 percent in 1987, the latest
year for which statistics could be calculated.
   Minnesota ranked first with a high school completion rate of
90.6 percent, while the District of Columbia was last at 55.5
percent. Wyoming showed the most improvement, zooming from 25th in
1982 to second in 1987; Michigan did the worst, falling from 28th
to 48th.
   The Council of Chief State School Officers took a relatively
rosy view of the wall chart, saying the trend in the past few years
has been positive. The group noted that 44 of the 50 states have
made college entrance test gains since 1982 and 38 states have
improved their high school completion rates since then.
   But Gordon Ambach, executive director of the council, added that
``the task ahead is gigantic,'' particularly in light of ``the
urgent needs of our nation's economically disadvantaged youth and
those with limited proficiency in English.''
   The department noted that Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina
and the District, all with relatively high poverty rates, have
registered some of the largest increases in college entrance test
scores since 1982. It said this shows that states with large
proportions of disadvantaged sudents can make great progress.
   However, while South Carolina showed the most improvement of any
state, with a 48-point gain in SAT scores since 1982, it still
ranked dead last this year among the 22 states in which the SAT is
the dominant test, with a score of 838. The District was second
from the bottom despite healthy gains.
   Alabama tied for the top in ACT improvement, up nine-tenths of a
point since 1982, but was ranked 21st of the 28 states this year
where most students take the ACT. Mississippi was came up 28th or
last, with an average score of 16.2.
   Mississippi also ranked last _ this time among all the states _
in per-pupil spending. The state spent $2,350 per student in 1988.
Alaska was the highest at $8,010, followed by New York at $6,497.
   The wall chart also compares states on teacher salaries,
pupil-teacher ratios and education reform efforts. Alaskan teachers
were paid the highest in 1988, $40,424, while South Dakotans were
at the bottom with $19,758. The national average last year was
$28,008, up from $19,274 in 1982.
   Class size ranged from a low in Connecticut, with a
student-teacher ratio of just over 13-1, to a high in Utah, which
had 24.7 students for each teacher. The national average was 17.6.
   On the reform front, the department found that 23 states have
minimum competency testing for graduation and a dozen have tests
for grade promotion. Eight states have authority to intervene in
academically bankrupt districts. Forty-four states require or will
soon require new teachers to take a certification exam and three
require current teachers to take such a test.

   Students said today they will hold a ``great
protest'' for democratic reform now that the government has
rejected their demand for recognition of new independent student
unions.
   The government also claimed that unidentified non-students who
oppose communist rule have been advising student protesters from
behind the scenes, and it suggested that leading dissident Fang
Lizhi might be one of them. Fang denied involvement.
   The accusation seemed to herald government action against
liberal thinkers admired by students. Such action against Fang and
other leading independent intellectuals followed student protests
in 1987.
   ``Our protest tomorrow will show that Chinese democracy has
arrived at a new stage,'' said student leader Wu'er Kaixi of the
Beijing Normal College.
   Thursday is the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the
first pro-democracy student protests in China.
   ``Tomorrow we shall carry out a great protest with the support
of the people,'' Wu'er said. ``May Fourth is a people's holiday.''
   About 60 journalists for state-run newspapers announced plans
for their own protest Thursday to express anger over censorship,
especially tight controls over what they have been allowed to say
about the student protests.
   The protests began April 15 and are the biggest in 40 years of
communist rule, but most papers are limited to printing only brief,
understated reports on the events provided by the official Xinhua
News Agency.
   Tens of thousands of Beijing students have joined in marches,
sit-ins, pamphleteering and a class boycott to press their demands
for democratic reforms. Students in a half-dozen other cities have
held smaller marches; some students in Tianjin and Shanghai have
boycotted class.
   The general secretary of the Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang, today
addressed a handpicked audience of thousands of youths at a May
Fourth celebration in the Great Hall of the People. He praised the
1919 protests for their contribution to China's advancement, but he
said stability is what the country needs now.
   ``If stability is destroyed, what can be achieved?'' he said.
``Can science and democracy be achieved? They cannot. All that will
result is turmoil.''
   Police said they would close central Tiananmen Square on
Thursday, apparently in an effort to head off another demonstration
there.
   Last Thursday, about 150,000 students and their supporters broke
through police lines into the square, China's symbolic seat of
power.
   Students from several other cities also said they planned
marches Thursday in solidarity with the Beijing students' demands
for a free press, an end to official corruption and other reforms.
   Government spokesman Yuan Mu today rejected demands from the
students to recognize their new independent group, the United
Association of Beijing Universities, and meet with members. Protest
leaders had said if the government rejected the demands, they would
march.
   Yuan told a news conference he hoped the students would not
stage a protest, but he refused to say what action would be taken
if they did. He repeated the government's assertion that the
association and student unions set up on individual campuses are
illegal.
   ``Behind the students are a very few people ... Trying to create
social disturbances,'' Yuan said. ``They try to accomplish during
disturbances goals that they cannot attain in circumstances of
political stability.''
   He stopped short of directly accusing Fang, an internationally
renowned astrophysicist, of advising the protesters but he
questioned Fang's patriotism:
   ``The role Mr. Fang wants to play in the current disturbances
will be decided by his words and deeds.''
   Fang, who has called for multiparty democracy, denied
involvement in the protests.
   Yuan ``knows I have never been to Tiananmen Square, never been
to Beijing University in the last few weeks,'' he said in a
telephone interview.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some members of Congress hope to halt
President Bush's plans to co-produce a new jet fighter with Japan,
saying it would ``shut down American industries'' by giving vital
U.S. technology to the Japanese.
   But key congressional leaders said the votes may not be
available to override Bush's expected veto of any congressional
resolution disapproving the deal for production of the FSX fighter,
an advanced version of the F-16.
   Bush administration sources said the White House is ``reasonably
convinced'' that it has sufficient support in Congress to prevent
passage of the disapproval resolutions in the first place.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., has said that a two-thirds
majority probably cannot be mustered in the House to override a
veto, and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine said that
was likely the case in the Senate as well.
   ``It's a good deal for us and we're going to do our best to hold
the president's position,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole
of Kansas after a meeting at the White House.
   Dole said he believes there are at least 34 votes in the Senate
to sustain a presidential veto.
   Meanwhile, the General Accounting Office, the chief
congressional watchdog agency, has challenged one of the Bush
administration's arguments for going ahead with the FSX deal.
   The GAO has concluded that much or all of the technology the
United States is expected to receive from Japan is already well
known to the American aircraft industry, a congressional source
told The Associated Press last weekend.
   The GAO findings, which are being provided to legislators in
classified briefings this week, are expected to be reported in an
unclassified version at a hearing next Tuesday of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, The New York Times said today.
   Several senators and House members said they plan an all-out
attack on the co-production agreement.
   ``If this deal is not killed by Congress we are entering into an
agreement with a country that has made it a prime industrial policy
to shut down American industries,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.
   ``We have signed an agreement with a country whose government
and industries keep domestic prices high so the Japanese can sell
their products lower in our country,'' he said.
   In the House, Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said the FSX
arrangement will hurt U.S. competitiveness in aerospace by giving
the Japanese advanced U.S. technology on the integration of
aerospace systems.

<HEAD>Productivity Up 0.5 Percent For First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers in the
non-farm sector of the economy rose 0.5 percent in the first three
months of 1989, up 0.2 percent from the first quarter of 1988, the
government reported today.
   The Labor Department said output in the non-farm sector rose 3.6
percent during the first quarter while hours worked increased by
3.1 percent.
   Significant productivity gains were reported in the
manufacturing sector after a sluggish fourth quarter.
   The department reported productivity in manufacturing rose at a
3.8 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter,
with output rising a substantial 4.6 percent while hours of all
persons working increased just 0.8 percent.
   That compared to a revised productivity gain of 1.6 percent in
manufacturing in the fourth quarter of 1988 and was an improvement
over the 3.2 percent gain reported in the first quarter a year ago.
   In the non-farm sector as a whole, the Labor Department reported
that unit labor costs rose 5.2 percent in the first quarter, up
from 4.1 percent in the previous three months.
   In the manufacturing sector, hourly compensation increased by
4.1 percent but, in a sign that wage gains made by American workers
are lagging behind inflation, the department said real hourly
compensation for the sector dropped 1.2 percent when the increase
in consumer prices was taken into account.
   In the overall business sector _ which takes farming into
account _ productivity rose 3.5 percent in the first quarter, a
figure heavily influenced by the rebound from last year's drought.
Productivity had declined 1.0 percent in the overall business
sector in the final quarter of 1988.
   Today's productivity report contained a number of revisions of
previously reported data for 1988.
   As revised, the department said non-farm business productivity
rose 1.5 percent for all of 1988, with output growing by a revised
5.2 percent while hours worked increased by 3.7 percent. Also
reported was a revised increase in unit labor costs for the year of
3.1 percent.

<TEXT>
   The World Gypsy Congress said today
it had unconfirmed reports that about 50 Romanian Gypsies were
killed by Romanian border guards after they tried to escape to
Hungary.
   The incident purportedly took place a month ago. The secretary
of the Gypsy Congress, Rajko Djuric, said the claims prompted Gypsy
leaders to launch an international campaign to investigate the
report.
   ``We do not know exactly the date or the place, but several
different sources provided enough details for us to conclude that
the report about this massacre is true,'' Djuric told The
Associated Press.
   ``They came to the Hungarian border at night and crossed it
illegally. But, since they were anthropologically easily
recognizable _ for their darker complexion _ the Hungarians turned
them back,'' Djuric alleged.
   ``Once back on the Romanian side of the border they were mowed
down by Romanian armed border guards,'' he said.
   Djuric called for a commission of European parliaments to help
investigate the allegations and said he was alerting the United
Nations and the Helsinki Federation for Human Rights.

   Works by 27 contemporary artists fetched record
prices as the annual spring art-buying frenzy got under way at
Sotheby's auction house.
   Reflecting a trend in the art world, about a fourth of the
buyers Tuesday were Japanese, said Lucy Mitchell Innes, a Sotheby's
spokeswoman.
   Among the records was $11.5 million for a Jackson Pollock drip
painting that the buyer felt was a bargain.
   ``I was extremely pleased to get it at what many in the trade
feel is a very advantageous price,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, who
bought ``Number 8, 1950,'' for an anonymous collector. ``Sometimes
you just get lucky.''
   The previous record for a Pollock painting was $5.72 million
last year for his ``Frieze.''
   Tuesday's sale, with total receipts of $78.6 million, was a
record for a contemporary art auction.
   Tuesday's auction kicked off 12 days of selling at Sotheby's and
Christie's, two of the world's biggest auction houses. More than
4,400 artworks are expected to be sold for a total of $572 million.
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973, inspired
by the suicide of a close friend of the artist, sold for $6.2
million. The record for Bacon was $1.76 million in 1987 for ``Study
for Portrait II.''
   Five sculptures with tasty themes by Claes Oldenburg also sold:
``Ice Cream Sandwich,'' $407,000; ``Plate of Meat,'' $396,000;
``Bacon and Egg,'' $495,000; ``Cheesecake from Javatime,'' $52,250;
and ``Green Beans,'' $264,000.
   Andy Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which portrays a ruby-lipped
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as first lady in 1963, sold for
$750,000, more than twice the presale estimate.
   All prices include a 10 percent house commission.
   Next Tuesday, Sotheby's sale of impressionist and modern
paintings and sculpture will feature Gauguin's ``Mata Mua,'' circa
1892, completed during the artist's first trip to Tahiti. Estimated
at $20 million to $25 million, it is being sold by Jaime
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, and Baron Hans
Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, a member of the advisory board of
Sotheby's Holdings.
   The same day, ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait done in Paris
during the artist's blue period, is expected to command $15 million
to $20 million. It is being sold by Wendell Cherry, president and
chief executive officer of Humana Inc., the hospital management
corporation based in Louisville, Ky.
   Another Warhol portrait, ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964 depiction of
Marilyn Monroe, will be offered Wednesday at Christie's. The
estimate for the silkscreen work is $1.5 million to $2 million.

   Six riot police were killed and 10
critically injured today when they were set on fire by radical
students, and President Roh Tae-woo said he may impose emergency
measures to end violent protests.
   Roh, in a nationally televised speech, said the government is
determined to end a wave of protests that has hit South Korea in
recent weeks. He did not specify any action, but under the
constitution he may rule by decree or impose martial law if he
deems the nation is facing an emergency.
   ``If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future
of the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as
empowered by the constitution,'' Roh said.
   The officers were killed during a dawn raid at Dongui University
in Pusan, about 200 miles southeast of Seoul, as they tried to
break into a room on the seventh floor of the library to free five
officers held hostage.
   Militants set fire to a barricade drenched with paint thinner as
the policemen were climbing over it, police said. Several officers,
wrapped in flames, leapt out of windows while others were burned or
asphyxiated, said police officials who declined to be identified.
   National police headquarters in Seoul said it was the worst loss
of police life in recent years. Police said some of the 10
policemen critically injured were expected to die. One student was
critically hurt.
   All the hostages were released unharmed after professors at the
private college pleaded with students, police said. They said 88
students were arrested for questioning.
   National Police Chief Jo Jong-suk resigned. In South Korea,
senior officials often resign to atone for a disaster even if it is
not their fault.
   Also today, news reports said the U.S. Cultural Center in the
provincial city of Kwangju would be temporarily closed and moved to
an as yet undetermined location. The center is a frequent target of
radical students demanding the ouster of U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea.
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy denied the report by the Yonhap
news agency.
   Roh charged in his speech that radical students are trying to
stage a violent revolution and declared the government is
determined to crush them.
   ``It has become clear that behind the flames that took the lives
of young people, there are revolutionary groups which resort to
violence to achieve their goals,'' he said.
   Opposition parties also denounced the deaths today and called
for an end to political violence.
   Hundreds of radical students calling for Roh's overthrow battled
riot police around at least two Seoul campuses. Protesters cheered
at Sungkyunkwan University when several policemen were set ablaze
by firebombs, but colleagues quickly doused the flames and the
officers were not hurt.
   Protests here rarely result in deaths. Riot police normally are
armed only with tear gas and batons.
   Prosecutors said students implicated in today's deaths would
face charges of arson, which carry a maximum penalty of death.
Officials said no one had been charged.
   Stunned riot officers wept as the dead and injured were taken
away. About 150 police officers staged a sit-down protest at Pusan
police headquarters to complain that senior officers mishandled the
attack, Yonhap reported.
   Police officials said about 700 riot police raided the private
college after negotiations failed to free the hostages.
   Students seized the officers Tuesday after demonstrating against
the firing of warning shots by police at attackers who menaced a
police station Monday, police said. The students demanded police
exchange the hostages for an arrested student.
   The Education Ministry ordered the university closed
indefinitely while police investigate the incident.
   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent
weeks by radical students and dissidents demanding the overthrow of
Roh's government.
   The radicals lack public support because of their extremism and
violent tactics, but they have formed alliances with striking
workers to step up the protests.
   In a related report, police said today about 3,800 police have
been injured this year by firebombs, rocks, clubs and iron bars
while blocking violent protesters.
   Police said 9,950 police were injured in 1986 and 6,701 in 1987.

<TEXT>
   Presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr.
wants to leave the country with his fiancee, says assassination
expert Mark Lane, whom Hinckley has asked to represent him.
   Lane said Hinckley, 33, wants to start a new life abroad with
formal mental patient Leslie deVeau, who was found innocent by
reason of insanity in the 1982 shotgun slaying of her 10-year-old
daughter.
   ``Together they would like to go to some other country and
promise they'll never return,'' Lane said in an interview Tuesday
night. ``He wants to go abroad and try to live a normal life.''
   He said Hinckley, who was found innocent by reason of insanity
in the attempted assassination of President Reagan, did not specify
what country he wants to live in.
   Lane also said in the interview that he would not exploit
Hinckley if he decides to become his attorney, despite what a
hospital attorney argued.
   ``I've never written a book about any client of mine,'' said
Lane, author of books about the assassinations of President Kennedy
and civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King. Lane, who later
represented King assailant James Earl Ray, met with Hinckley for
two hours Tuesday.
   ``He's asked me to represent him, and I agreed that I would read
all of the files in his case at St. Elizabeths and tell him if it
would be appropriate for me,'' said Lane.
   Lane said Hinckley feels his proposal to leave the hospital
makes more sense than the hospital's policy of issuing weekend
passes to select patients and requiring them to stay in the area.
   Hinckley received permission from U.S. District Judge June L.
Green on April 20 to start negotiations to hire Lane. Previously,
Lane said, the mental hospital had barred him from meeting with
Hinckley.
   ``The attorney for St. Elizabeths told me the reason I was
seeking out his case and wanted to represent him was so I could
write a book about him and exploit him,'' he said. Lane emphasized
that Hinckley made the initial contact.
   In addition to his quest to leave the country, Hinckley has two
primary requests, Lane said _ to be returned from maximum security
to medium security and to be allowed to speak with the media.
   In 1987, prosecutors turned up evidence Hinckley was
corresponding with serial killer Ted Bundy, who was executed last
year. A cache of letters about actress Jodie Foster was uncovered
last summer, Lane said.
   ``Each time, St. Elizabeths administration was embarrassed when
he was taken to court,'' said Lane. ``They retaliated by placing
him back in maximum security.''
   Lane acknowledged that Hinckley told him ``it was actually
stupid of him to write to Bundy.'' In the case of the Foster
letters, Lane said Hinckley told him a ``guy'' kept writing him
asking if he'd like pictures of Foster, and Hinckley finally
requested the pictures in an effort to stop the letters.
   Prosecutors contend that Hinckley shot President Reagan and
three other men here on March 30, 1981, to impress Miss Foster.
   Asked if he was leaning toward representing Hinckley, Lane said,
``I think he needs assistance, and I think that his rights are
being violated.'' Lane said he would make a decision within two
weeks.
   Lane is the author of ``Rush to Judgment: A Citizen's Dissent,''
the best-selling book about the Warren Commission Report into
President Kennedy's assassination, and coauthor, with Dick Gregory,
of ``Code Name Zorro,'' a chronicle of King's assassination.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Begins Interviews of Wright's Fellow Investors</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 3 grafs new with depositions beginning, Myers comment; edits
to conform.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee today began tying
up loose ends in its 11-month probe of Speaker Jim Wright by
hearing from the first of a group of Texas investors in a gas well
that yielded huge profits for Wright.
   San Antonio financier Morris Jaffe was the first to go before
the panel, entering the hearing room in the Capitol basement with
his Washington lawyer, Stanley Brand. Jaffe and four others ``stood
up'' the committee a week ago when two members traveled to San
Antonio to interview them.
   ``I hope they will cooperate, for the sake of getting this task
completed,'' said Rep. John T. Myers, R-Ind., the panel's senior
Republican. Myers said the work of inquiring into the gas well
venture was tying up committee staff who otherwise could be
preparing for a disciplinary hearing for Wright, expected to come
late this month.
   The committee is seeking to clear up circumstances under which
Wright and his business partner, George Mallick, were brought into
the well venture in Sabine Lake near the Texas-Louisiana line, and
parlayed an initial cash outlay of $9,120 into a $340,000 profit in
less than five months.
   In a 23-page defense the investors issued Monday by Brand they
argued that the well was a legitimate business venture and not, as
ethics committee counsel Richard Phelan argued, a potential funnel
for gifts to Wright.
   The investors say they still plan to invest more into sinking
another well at the site in hopes of freeing millions of dollars
worth of gas and petroleum.
   Also subpoenaed were Jaffe's son Doug, president of the family's
companies; Marlyn Cherry, the Jaffes' bookkeeper; Doug Prestridge,
a geologist; and Dave Myers, who supplied the drilling equipment
for the well.
   In a related matter, Wright on Tuesday defended his use of the
Congressional Record to praise a video program his wife helped
develop, but a member of the House ethics committee said the panel
might have to look at the incident.
   ``I don't think there's anything improper about it,'' Wright
told reporters. ``I think it's a tempest in a teapot.''
   But Myers said the situation ``certainly does raise a question''
and could be discussed by the ethics committee. ``It's something
for the whole committee to decide,'' he said.
   In 1985, Wright used his position as a congressman to insert
into the official Capitol publication a column effusively praising
a family motivational video series produced by the Pacific
Institute. The column did not mention that his wife, Betty, was
then drawing a $36,000 salary from the company.
   House rules prohibit a lawmaker from benefiting financially
because of his official position, and guidelines advise that House
members not become too closely associated with any particular
business or make commercial endorsements.
   Also on Tuesday, Wright criticized the ethics committee's
process, saying he has been denied a chance to address the issues
that formed the basis for the 69 counts of House rules violations
he now faces.
   ``I thought I'd answered everything they had in mind,'' Wright
said, referring to his testimony to the committee last September.
But the ultimate charges were based on information that was
developed since then, he said.
   At the same time, Wright and his advisers continued to map a
plan for making the speaker's case both to the ethics committee, at
an anticipated disciplinary hearing late this month, and to the
public.
   Sources said Wright complained vigorously at a strategy session
Monday that he was being unfairly pilloried by the press and by the
ethics committee and voiced frustration that the story of his
public service career, from World War II on, was being obscured.
   Advisers also discussed how to handle the announcement of an
emerging defense team led by his current lawyer, William Oldaker,
and bolstered by the presence of Democratic patriarch Clark
Clifford and perhaps other attorneys with strong courtroom defense
experience.

<HEAD>Black Man Dragged To Death, Witness Testifies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white businessman tied a
black farm laborer to the back of his truck and dragged him more
than half a mile on dirt and tar roads until he died, a witness
testified at a murder trial.
   The witness, Michael C. van Rensburg, told the Supreme Court
that his employer, John A. Perreira, 53, tied laborer Molefe Tholi
Nzima by the neck to the tow bar of his truck. Van Rensburg said
his employer then drove the truck through water, down a dirt road
and along a paved road until he swung onto his own property, where
the victim's head slammed into a cement block.
   Van Rensburg testified in Witbank, east of Johannesburg, on
Tuesday.
   He said that on Nov. 18, 1987, he and Perreira were looking for
someone who had been stealing chickens from Perreira's farm in
Ogies, near Witbank, and had received permission from a white
neighbor to question his laborers.
   Perreira threatened a woman at Nzima's house with a gun, then
tied Nzima's arms, body and legs with nylon rope, winding the rope
four times around the man's neck before attaching him to the tow
bar, van Rensburg said.
   After Nzima's head hit the block, Perreira poured water on the
victim to revive him. But Nzima muttered something and died, van
Rensburg said.
   Nzima's bloodied body was taken to a police station. Van
Rensburg said Perreira told him to say Nzima had been stealing
sheep and cattle for about five years and that he died when he fell
off the truck. Van Rensburg said he told the police that story, but
the next day he returned to tell the truth.
   Perreira denies the charge and the trial continues.

<HEAD>Botha Announces General Election For September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha today said a
general election will be held Sept. 6. He is expected to retire
shortly afterward.
   The election will be the first in which white, mixed-race and
Asian voters cast ballots on the same day for Parliament's three
segregated chambers.
   South Africa's black majority has no vote in national affairs
and no representation in Parliament.
   September marks the end of the five-year term for the Asian and
mixed-race chambers, which were estabished in 1984 following widely
boycotted elections for voters of those racial groups.
   The most recent white general election was in 1987.
   Botha's National Party is heavily favored to retain its
overwhelming majority in the dominant white chamber, where it now
holds 130 of the 178 seats.
   Botha, 73, last month announced his intention to retire after
the elections, although he did not set a date for the balloting at
that time. He has headed the government since 1978.
   The new president is expected to be the national education
minister, F.W. de Klerk, 53, who succeeded Botha as National Party
leader on Feb. 2. Many Nationalists view de Klerk as more flexible
than Botha and more capable of breaking the country's black-white
political stalemate.
   While the National Party will seek to retain its majority, the
extreme-right Conservative Party and the anti-apartheid Democratic
Party will be vying to the largest opposition faction.
   The Conservatives currently have a two-seat edge over the
Democartic Party, formed last month through a merger of three
separate liberal parties.

   Abrasive talk show host Morton Downey Jr. has at
least one believer in his disputed account of a violent encounter
with skinheads in a San Francisco airport.
   ``I believe him,'' Phil Donahue said during recording of his
show Tuesday with Downey as a guest. The program was to be
broadcast today.
   Police and airport officials have said there was no evidence
such an attack took place and suggested the incident was staged.
   Downey told Donahue how he was attacked by skinheads who cut his
hair and drew swastikas on his face. He lifted a toupee to show the
bald spot.
   He acknowledged there are rumors that his show may be canceled
because of the publicity surrounding the incident. Downey's
producers and distributor have not publicly supported him.
   ``Sure I'm in professional jeopardy,'' Downey said. ``And if I'm
lying I'm in mental jeopardy and need a rubber room.''
   Donahue said he did not want Downey off the air.
   ``We'd have to find someone else,'' Donahue said. ``He not only
keeps us honest, he keeps us more aggressive.''

<TEXT>
   A fire at a high-tech company sent an
orange-brown cloud of poisonous gas mushrooming into the sky,
forcing an evacuation and sending 19 people to hospitals.
   Those taken to three hospitals from Tuesday's accident at
Advanced Dielectrics Inc. complained of burning lungs and skin and
shortness of breath. Hospital officials said no one was seriously
injured and most were released Tuesday night.
   More than 500 workers were evacuated from nearby businesses when
a dried resin containing the chemical bromine ignited in a
ventilation pipe and produced highly toxic hydrogen bromide gas,
officials said. The smoke from the fire contained nitrogen cyanide,
bromide, and carbon monoxide, officials said.
   ``You just go down your bad-news list and you'll find all these
substances there,'' said Inspector Larry Stephenson. ``The
materials can be deadly, depending on the combination of gases.''
   Advanced Dielectrics manufactures electronic circuit boards. The
fire was the second in as many days at a high-tech firm in Fremont,
which is about 30 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   A blaze on Monday at Trend Circuits Co. sent 13 employees of a
neighboring firm to the hospital when a solvent combined with
hydrogen peroxide and ignited. All 13 were treated and released at
Washington Hospital.

   Three Belgians have been arrested and charged
with possession of $4 million worth of Renaissance paintings stolen
at gunpoint from a Swiss art gallery last month.
   The nine paintings were among 21 taken in an April 12 armed
robbery at the Koetser Gallery in Zurich, U.S. Attorney Benito
Romano said Tuesday.
   The three people taken into custody were identified as Rene De
Grove, 54, Thierry Houze, 29, and Martine Wins, 26, officials said.
   De Grove and Houze were identified in court documents as two of
the robbers and Ms. Wins was identified as Houze's companion.
   All three were arrested Monday at De Grove's apartment by
undercover FBI agents.
   They were charged with possession of internationally transported
stolen goods, according to a criminal complaint filed at federal
court.
   ``De Grove voluntarily gave a statement in which, in substance,
he admitted that he was one of the three who robbed the Koetser
Gallery and that he had brought three of the stolen paintings into
the United States on or about April 29,'' said the complaint.
   The art gallery was robbed April 12. Three armed robbers who
bound and gagged a gallery employee got away with 21 works by
artists such as Jan Meartens, the Younger; Jan Steen; Willem Van
Aelst and Dirck Hals.
   If convicted, all three defendants face maximum penalties of 10
years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

   Assailants threw two bombs at a
U.S. Embassy warehouse, causing damage but no casualties, police
said today.
   Police officers on the scene said the attack Tuesday night was
presumably the work of leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed
government. But the rebels, in a communique broadcast on their
clandestine radio, denied that.
   The rebels called the bombing ``a blatant maneuver by the army
and Arena to complicate the visit of a delegation of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front to the United States.'' Arena is
the rightist party whose leader, Alfredo Cristiani, is to assume
the presidency June 1.
   The Farabundo front is the rebel army. Three representatives of
the front are in New York for talks with United Nations officials.
   The rebels repeated their pledge to refrain from attacking U.S.
personnel and U.S. economic and diplomatic institutions in El
Salvador.
   The bombs damaged a wall and the roof of the warehouse. There
was no immediate estimate of the cost of repairing the damages.
U.S. Embassy officials were not immediately available to comment on
the attack.

<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan immigrant who won a $5.3 million
lottery jackpot got more good news today as immigration officials
reversed themselves and granted his application for political
asylum.
   Justo Ricardo Somarriba, along with his wife and three children,
had faced the prospect of having to take the money back to
Nicaragua if the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service backed
a State Department finding that his political asylum claim was
frivolous.
   But today INS district director Perry Rivkind said he personally
had reviewed the case and granted the asylum.
   ``This has nothing to do with the jackpot,'' Rivkind said. ``He
was a teacher in the government education department, and he
resisted propagandizing on behalf of the Sandinista Marxist
government.''
   That could subject him to political persecution if he returned
to his homeland, Rivkind said.
   Even if he hadn't been granted asylum, state lottery officials
said he still would have gotten his half of last week's $10.6
million Lotto jackpot.
   ``Anybody who wins keeps the money,'' said Ed George, a lottery
spokesman in Tallahassee. In California, an illegal Mexican
immigrant was deported _ with his money _ after winning the lottery
in that state.
   Somarriba received the first of 20 annual checks for about
$264,000 at a ceremony Monday in Tallahassee.
   Somarriba, 30, from Masaya, Nicaragua, a rural town about 90
miles south of Managua, entered the country by crossing the Rio
Grande near Brownsville, Texas, on March 22, 1987, said Richard
Smith, Rivkind's deputy.
   He filed his application for asylum on May 6, 1987.
   ``We notified the State Department that his application was
considered frivolous on December 14, 1987. They approved and sent
it back to us on January 19, 1988. Since then it has been hung up
in paperwork,'' Smith said.
   Employees in the asylum unit are about 40,000 applications
behind, he said.
   Applications deemed frivolous are rarely approved on appeal,
Smith added.
   Somarriba lives in Miami with his wife, Maria Elena, and three
children, ages 9, 7 and 3.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   April 27
   Tucson (Ariz.) Citizen on abortion:
   The activists are so positive about abortion. They hide behind
their chosen ``pro'' words, protected against doubts. Pro-choice.
Pro-life.
   Caught between two extremes that have split the nation in a
moral civil war are the majority of thinking Americans, fed up with
simplistic shock rhetoric and self-serving doublespeak. Their
pro-word is protest. ...
   Pro-abortion groups warn of ``back-alley deaths'' by abortion
butchers if abortion is outlawed. They beg sympathy for the poor
unwed mother or rape victim for whom an abortion is the difference
between life and death of hope and opportunity.
   At the other extreme are the anti-abortion marchers who shock
with pictures of well-advanced fetuses. They describe women who
have abortions as murderers, and compare 1.6 million abortions each
year to history's most appalling genocide.
   Both sides tell sophisticated lies.
   If the Supreme Court allowed the states to decide ..., there
would be no need for back alley deaths. ...
   The Missouri law being reviewed by the Supreme Court doesn't
outlaw abortion. It restricts state support. Most abortions are
done in private clinics.
   And most women who obtain abortions are not rape victims, nor
are they poor. The implication that some see abortion as a
convenient birth control of last resort is morally repugnant, and
belies the stereotype favored by pro-abortion propaganda.
   But equally unjust is the ``abortion on demand'' cliche that
justifies state interference to halt alleged ``casual
carelessness'' with human life and let government make our moral
decisions.

   May 1
   Los Angeles Times on President Bush's environmental appointees:
   (President) Bush has made one outstanding appointment in William
K. Reilly as chief of the Environmental Protection Agency.
   But his selections for other critical nature-resource jobs raise
serious questions about the administration's pledge to safeguard
the nation's parks, wilderness and coastline. ...
   James Cason has been nominated as assistant secretary of
agriculture in charge of the U.S. Forest Service and Cy Jamison has
been selected to be director of the Bureau of Land Management. ...
   Cason is a former Oregon real estate developer who constantly
ran afoul of the nation's environmental organizations as deputy
assistant secretary of the interior. Jamison ... for the past eight
years he has been an aide to Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont).
   Bush's determination to build a strong environmental record will
be severly undermined _ or doomed _ unless he also has managers at
Interior and the Forest Service who are willing to put conservation
and protection of the nation's dwindling natural estate ahead of
the business-as-usual practice of commercial exploitation.
   The new appointees should be given a chance to demonstrate such
a commitment, but so far, the record is not encouraging.

   April 28
   Skagit Valley Herald, Mount Vernon, Wash., on the Bush-Quayle
first 100 days:
   Assessments of the first 100 days of the Bush-Quayle
administration, which have poured from Washington like a river ...,
have been nothing if not predictable.
   Read what President Bush or Vice President Quayle has to say
about the first 100 days: Just fine; gaining momentum; under
control.
   Read what conservatives say: competent if not spectacular.
   Read what liberals say: lack of focus, unimpressive.
   Funny, that's exactly what they were saying last year before the
election.
   The fact is, 100 days is too soon for anyone _ the president
included _ to make any meaningful assessment of a new
administration. In that short amount of time the president can do
little more than react to situations while he tries to put his team
together.
   Members of that new team, in the meantime, are still trying to
remember the way to the nearest restroom.
   The measure of a presidency is how successful it is at
accomplishing the goals it sets for itself, and how appropriate
those goals turn out to be. The voters will be making the final
assessment on that when they go to the polls in 1992.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on dismantling the
Pentagon:
   Little by little, piece by piece, the Reagan Revolution, insofar
as it affected the nation's armed forces, is being dismantled.
Money, more precisely a shortage of money, is at the bottom of it.
   With not enough money in a trillion-dollar-plus budget to go
around, not enough to sate the insatiable demands of politically
attractive social programs, not enough to begin to reduce the
crushing burden of accumulated debt, the Army, the Navy and the Air
Force become attractive targets for those with eyes focused less on
the stars than on the next election. ...
   Now, there is nothing inherently wrong in reasoned reductions in
the nation's armed strength to match reductions in perceived threat
_ indeed, were Congress and the administration to support
enormously expensive armed forces in excess of those actually
required to deter war, they would be no less guilty of malfeasance
than if the forces they funded were by design inadequate to the
task. ...
   We hope that President Bush and Secretary (Dick) Cheney, both
new in the job, have not gotten the horse before the cart. The last
thing we need is a return to the dreadful 1960s and '70s when our
armed forces were stretched to the breaking point and, some would
say, beyond.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on Mikhail Gorbachev:
   See Mikhail Gorbachev smile. Now see him bite.
   The Soviet president has purged a third of the ruling Communist
Central Committee.
   Officially, the departures were described as ``resignations.''
   Uhhhhhh-huh. Imagine 110 entrenched Communists deciding to
retire gracefully from powerful public office at precisely the same
moment.
   In fact, Gorbachev has accomplished what all Soviet leaders must
do. The alternative is to lose power to someone else. It's not
democratic, but it's effective. ...
   Americans should be neither totally naive nor completely cynical.
   The winds of revolution blow hard in the Soviet Union. When they
are warm, they are welcome. When they are cold, nations suffering
under communism feel the iron fist of power.
   Now it looks like an outstretched hand. But a hand can still be
a fist.

   Tampa (Fla.) Tribune on the USS Iowa:
   Many Americans' hearts fill with awe and pride at the sight of a
battleship. Others would respond similarly to the sight of a troop
of horse cavalry, but they can't.
   While the Navy still has battleships, such as the Iowa in whose
No. 2 gun turret an explosion April 19 killed 47 crew members, the
Army's horse cavalry is long gone, replaced by tanks. ...
   The explosion in its No. 2 turret is not a major reason for
mothballing the Iowa and its three sisters again, and for the last
time.
   The best reason has existed for decades, and it's a shame that
it took the deaths of 47 brave men to remind us that the
battleship, like the horse cavalry, has long since had its day.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on the USS Iowa:
   The USS Iowa, first launched in 1942, has served the United
States from a period that spans World War II to a 1988 tour near
the Persian Gulf.
   Former Navy Secretary Frank Knox once called it the greatest
ship ever launched by the United States.
   But weapons become obsolete.
   The time to retire the USS Iowa and the three other (World War
II-era) battleships may have arrived.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on the USS Iowa:
   The Navy has acted properly in convening a board of inquiry into
the explosion aboard the USS Iowa that claimed the lives of 47
seamen. ...
   While we may never learn the cause of the disaster, the Navy has
acted wisely, we believe, in imposing a moratorium on the firing of
all its 16-inch guns.
   It is now up to the Defense Department to go one step more and
conduct a thorough review of the need to retain these old ships
like the Iowa in service.
   What we have here is World War I technology aboard a World War
II ship attempting to defend a nation headed into the 21st century.
   The USS Iowa and its sister ships are nearing the half-century
mark. The technology of those 16-inch guns requires sailors to hand
carry 110-pound silk bags of gunpowder to load the guns.
   We do not question the unmatched capacity for sustained
firepower that these ships can deliver, but the question should be
asked if maybe they were better suited for helping contain
brushfire wars in various parts of the globe and be replaced for
general combat.
   For the billions of dollars we spend on defense, we think it's
time we think about retiring aging battleships that present a risk
of life for our own servicemen.

   The Journal, Providence, R.I., on East-West short-range missile
talks:
   As he slid deeper into political trouble this past week, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought relief by looking eastward,
not West. ...
   Kohl's new disarmament proposals, notably his urgent insistence
on short-range missile reduction talks with Moscow, will surely
throw the NATO allies into some confusion when they meet (in late
May).
   Both the United States and Britain are opposed to such early
discussions _ especially since the fine details of Mikhail
Gorbachev's suggestions are not yet fully understood, and the Bush

   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on same-day voter
registration:
   The New Jersey Rainbow Coalition is calling for same-day voter
registation in the state. In other states, this system has spurred
greater voter participation and no increase in election fraud.
   The Rainbow Coalition makes some other good points. For example,
why can't citizens register to vote at government agencies, as they
pay for water bills or renew a drivers license?
   Why must voters register before a 29-day cutoff? Why are
registered voters purged from the voting rolls if they haven't cast
a ballot over a four-year period?
   The United States ranks among the lowest in voter turnout among
the Western democracies, but our powers-that-be aren't too worried
about that. Why should they be? If the demographics of the voting
public ever changed, perhaps they'd become powers-that-were.
   We should all be concerned that such a large chunk of society _
made up largely of the underprivileged and undereducated _ doesn't
vote because of the red tape and bureaucratic hassles.

<HEAD>Report Says Releases Higher Than Expected at Ohio Uranium Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radioactive releases from a government uranium
processing plant in Ohio likely have been two to six times greater
than estimated, and internal documents reveal a history of
deceptive recordkeeping and inadequate pollution monitoring, a
consultant reported today.
   The findings involve a 1,050-acre Energy Department plant at
Fernald, Ohio, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, where federal
officials have acknowledged that significant amounts of uranium
particles over the years have been released into the air.
   The government has estimated that as much as 552,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the
plant, which has been producing uranium for nuclear weapons use for
nearly four decades.
   But the report by an engineering consulting firm indicates the
releases could be as great as 3.1 million pounds over 37 years, and
in any case was higher than the government's worst-case scenario.
   The report was prepared for lawyers pressing the $300 million
lawsuit against National Lead of Ohio Inc., which operated the
plant until 1985, on behalf of 14,000 people who live nearby.
   The suit, which alleges the plant has created a health hazard
and reduced property values, is scheduled to go to trial next
month. Chris Sankey, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said
the department would have no comment on the consultant's report
because of the litigation.
   The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research said it
based its higher release estimates on information provided by a
former plant supervisor in a court deposition and a computer
analysis of levels of radioactive contaminants found in soil
samples within five miles of the plant.
   ``The official estimates (cited so far by the government) of
cumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are based
in part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselves
describe as an `inherently deceptive' method of calculating'' some
of the releases, said Arjun Makhijani, the author of the study.
   Among the findings cited by the report:
   _Comments in a court deposition by Michael W. Boback, former
head of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant, during about
a dozen years stack filters at some buildings were not examined,
but ``zero loss'' entries were, nevertheless, made in release
records.
   _No adequate accounting was made of radioactive releases from
areas not specifically monitored, although internal documents show
such releases likely were significant. A spot check on such
releases during one month shows releaes greater than tabulated for
the plant's entire 37-year history in the government estimates.
   _Documents indicating that losses of uranium particles from
stack scrubbers were understated because the estimates were based
on highly efficient scrubbers, while internal plant memos show
scrubbers often malfunctioning or in poor condition.
   The engineering consultants also used a computer analysis of
soil samples within five miles of the plant showing average levels
of about eight times what would be expected if releases had been
limited to the estimates cited by the Energy Department.

   The judge in Oliver North's trial said today
he imposed a longer daily work schedule on the jury and said he
isn't surprised the panel is in its 11th day of deliberations
without reaching a verdict.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said in a court session that
he initiated the move to have the jury start promptly at 9 in the
morning, take a half hour for lunch and stay until 5 in the
afternoon. That schedule began Tuesday.
   Gesell said that due to health problems among some jurors early
in the deliberations, the panel had been working more limited hours
and ``they had gotten used to a shorter'' schedule. One panel
member was experiencing high blood pressure and a few others had
colds, but all are now in good health.
   The judge made the remarks in response to letters from
prosecutors and North's lawyers inquiring about various aspects of
deliberations.
   ``I felt there was time being wasted in the sense that when they
came in in the morning they were not starting as early as they
could have when they arrived,'' said Gesell. As for leaving at 4:15
in the afternoon, ``I felt I should indicate they should stay.''
   Gesell said he doesn't think it is surprising that the
deliberations are growing lengthy, in view of the fact that there
have been ``67 witnesses, 41 trial days and we are dealing with
over 250 exhibits.''
   ``We are running out of books'' to while away the hours,
prosecutor John Keker quipped, referring to the length of
deliberations.
   Gesell responded by saying he understood there is ``a movie you
could look at,'' referring to the TV miniseries on North's life,
``Guts and Glory,'' which concluded Tuesday night.
   The panel of nine women and three men deliberated 7{ hours
Tuesday, bringing the total spent at the end of the day since April
21 to 53.
   The jurors have put in six-hour workdays on three occasions
since that time, but hadn't gone longer than that until Tuesday.
   There has been no word from the jury since April 24, when the
last of eight notes was sent to Gesell. The notes ranged from
requests for paper clips to a plea for a nurse to monitor the high
blood pressure of a juror.
   Meanwhile, 10 news organizations including The Associated Press
said in a court filing they should be allowed to seek disclosure of
a document in the case.
   Gesell said in an April 22 ruling that the document is
classified. It summarizes highly sensitive intelligence on a
CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran in
November 1985.
   The document is being shown to the jury, but withheld from the
public at the request of the National Security Agency, the super
secret agency which collected the intelligence intercepts.
   Numerous court decisions ``have recognized that the press has
standing to assert rights of public access to proceedings and
records in criminal cases,'' said the court filing.
   Gesell has been directed by an appeals court to compile a record
spelling out national security concerns over possible disclosure of
the document. North's lawyers referred to the stipulation in
closing arguments, but the NSA says the document itself must remain
under seal.
   North used the stipulation to show CIA director William Casey
and deputy national security adviser John Poindexter knew at the
time that missiles were aboard the flight, yet agreed to cover up
their knowledge from Congress.
   The other news organizations seeking disclosure are Cable News
Network Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.; Dow Jones &amp; Co.
Inc.; National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National Public Radio; the
New York Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co. and The Washington Post.

   Doctors should spend more time counseling
their patients on how to lead healthier lives through diet,
exercise and other preventive means, a panel of health-care experts
says.
   The report Tuesday by U.S. Preventive Services Task Force also
questions the value of routine screening tests and says physicians
should reserve use of these procedures for high-risk patients.
   ``The key to improved health and disease prevention often lies
in lifestyle changes made by patients rather than in the broad
testing or sophisticated medical procedures performed by health
providers,'' Dr. Robert S. Lawrence, task force chairman and
director of primary care at Harvard Medical School, said upon
release the panel's Guide to Clinical Preventive Services.
   About 5,000 copies of the nearly 300-page guide are to be
distributed to medical educators and societies of health-care
professionals. It is expected to be available in medical bookstores
by summer.
   The guide recommends that physicians counsel their patients who
smoke on how to kick the habit, their sexually active patients on
how to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and all their patients
to engage in regular physical activity.
   Doctors should also provide periodic counseling on diet and all
patients should be urged to use seat belts and should be warned
about the effects of drugs and alcohol, the guide says.
   The guide also concludes that routine chest X-rays are
ineffective as a screening tool for lung cancer and that electronic
fetal monitoring _ currently used in more than half of all
deliveries _ should be used only for high-risk pregnancies.
   The panel said it is unclear whether fecal occult blood testing
is an effective routine screening tool for colorectal cancer or
whether digital rectal examinations are an effective test for
prostate cancer in men who have no symptoms of the disease.
   ``Our review of the data has shown that routinely performing a
uniform battery of tests on patients is often ineffective in
improving health and can potentially lead to large numbers of
inaccurate results,'' Lawrence said.
   Lawrence said that a greater emphasis on providing information
and patient counseling will require changes in the attitudes of
doctors and in the medical fee system. ``It's going to be a long,
hard struggle,'' he said.
   The report made no financial recommendations, but Lawrence said
insurance companies should change how they reimburse for physician
services, raising what they pay for information and counseling
services in relation to surgical services, which are generally
reimbursed at a higher rate.
   About 5 percent of federal health care dollars currently are
spent on preventive services, a Health and Human Services
Department official said.
   Dr. J. Michael McGinnis, deputy assistant secretary for health
at HHS, accepted the task force's report but offered little comment
on its conclusions, saying that Health Secretary Louis Sullivan
will ``need a little time to consider the vast array of
recommendations.''
   The task force, a 20-member panel of health-care experts, was
appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services in 1984.
It reviewed more than 2,400 scientific studies to assess the
effectiveness of more than 100 clinical screening procedures for
the prevention of 60 diseases and conditions.

<HEAD>Senate on Record Against Gasoline Tax Boost</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs with gas tax vote, picking up at pvs 4th graf, Debate
on</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>

   The Senate went on record today against
boosting gasoline taxes, as it pushed ahead with work on a budget
that complies with Congress' deficit-reduction agreement with the
White House.
   The anti-gas-tax amendment, approved by voice vote, expressed
the ``sense of the Senate'' that motor fuel taxes should remain
dedicated to improvements in the highway and transportation system.
   There is no specific call for such a tax in the trillion-dollar
spending plan now before Congress. However, sources have said the
administration is considering proposing to combine a gas-tax
increase with a reduction in the capital gains tax on investments
in the budget to be submitted next year.
   While Senate leaders accepted the non-binding gas-tax amendment
without a quarrel, Majority Leader George Mitchell said other
amendments might be used to undermine the White House agreement. In
those cases, the Maine Democrat said, ``a majority will prevail''
and the plan will survive.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, continued his criticism of the budget plan today,
although he now acknowledges he'll probably vote for it. The plan
contains ``those kind of assumptions that result in a budget that I
don't think has much realism to it,'' he said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   Debate on the $1.17 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990 began
Tuesday night in the Senate and was starting today in the House.
   The plan ``arrives here bloody, but I believe unbowed _ largely
because it represents the very best compromise reachable,'' said
Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee
that helped draft the blueprint.
   The agreement reached last month with the White House designed
to reduce the deficit by about $28 billion, to below the $100
billion limit of the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Critics of the agreement, and the budgets it has produced,
contend that the deficit reduction it claims is mostly illusory _
since billions of dollars in alleged ``savings'' are really just
accounting changes. For example, nearly $1 billion in payments to
farmers would be made early so they occur before the start of the
fiscal year.
   In addition, the resulting deficit projection is based on White
House economic forecasts that have been widely criticized as too
optimistic.
   But Sasser and others defending the plan said Congress should
focus on the positive.
   ``It's a first manageable step toward the ultimate deficit
reduction objective we all share,'' said Sasser, saying he hoped
for ``a strong vote for passage here on the Senate floor.''
   President Bush at the White House on Tuesday told congressional
leaders he hoped the budgets would be approved and lawmakers should
reject ``killer'' amendments. Several, including one to send the
whole deal back for further negotiations, were expected to be
offered.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said after the White
House meeting that the budget was ``close to what the
administration had asked for.'' He and the Democratic leaders were
working to make sure no amendments in their chamber would ``upset
the whole apple cart.''
   Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., senior Republican on the budget
panel, said those critical of the progress made in reducing the
deficit ``just don't know the facts.'' He cited projections of a
few years ago that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be
$300 billion, nearly twice what is now expected.
   ``What would a big deficit deal be?'' for next year, he asked.
``Taxes,'' he said, something Bush has promised to veto and the
Democrats don't want to embrace without presidential leadership.
   Actually, taxes are part of the current agreement. Both the
House and Senate budgets include the $5.3 billion in unspecified
new tax revenues that are in the White House agreement.
   The president contends most of that would be new revenue
generated by reducing the tax rate on capital gains, but Democrats
say they won't go along with that plan and suggest that alternative
levies acceptable to president must be found.
   The plans also include other new revenues, including $5.7
billion from selling off government assets and about $2.7 billion
in higher fees for government services.
   As called for in the White House pact between the president and
congressional leaders, both the House and Senate budgets envision
$299.2 billion in military spending next year, about the same as
the current year.
   The Pentagon would be given total spending authority of $305.5
billion, a figure which includes some outlays which stretch past
the end of the fiscal year.
   Foreign aid spending would be set at $17 billion.
   Entitlement programs would grow so individual benefits and
cost-of-living increases would escape cuts. However, a variety of
cost-cutting actions including some of those bookkeeping changes
would allow for $8.3 billion in total savings from Medicare,
agriculture, federal pensions, and other entitlements.
   In other domestic programs, the White House agreement set an
overall spending cap, but gave no specifics, and the House and
Senate budget committees took somewhat different approaches. The
House favored education, health and veterans programs compared with
more Senate emphasis on agriculture, energy and law enforcement.
   Once the House and Senate complete their budgets, the two
chambers must agree on a single resolution. The document then
serves as the guide for the annual spending and tax legislation
produced by the Congress.

<HEAD>Third Incident of Food Tampering Reported in Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third incident of food tampering in
less than a week has surfaced in central Illinois, as pinlike
objects were found in vending machine candy, authorities said today.
   A shoe-store employee at Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, just
north of Decatur, bit into a piece of candy and cut his mouth on a
sharp object Tuesday, said Sgt. Jerry Dawson of the Macon County
sheriff's police.
   Kevin Gentry, 26, spit the candy into a sink, Dawson said. After
waiting on customers he looked back into the sink and found metal
that could have been ``a broken-off straight pin or needle,''
Dawson said.
   A co-worker later found another pinlike object in a piece of the
candy-coated peanuts, Dawson said.
   Seven machines in the mall that serve up handfuls of the candy
were locked up pending investigation, Dawson said.
   Meanwhile, investigators say they believe that pins reportedly
found in Heinz baby food jars in Jacksonville and Springfield are
isolated incidents.
   The company's baby food was removed from store shelves in
Jacksonville Tuesday after a complaint Monday night. Springfield
grocers returned Heinz baby products to their shelves Tuesday after
an incident of food tampering was reported there last week.
   Nobody was hurt in either baby food case.
   Police in Springfield, about 35 miles east of Jacksonville, said
Monday that authorities had no objections to restocking because
there was no evidence the tampering occurred at the point of
production.
   Spokeswoman Beth Adams of Heinz U.S.A. in Pittsburgh, a division
of H.J. Heinz Co., said the criminal investigation in Springfield
is continuing, as tampering is a federal crime.
   There is a ``99-to-one'' chance that the Jacksonville complaint
will be found to be isolated and a ``copy-cat'' of tampering cases
in Great Britain, she said.
   Ms. Adams said Heinz U.S.A. has no connection to the Heinz
company affected by tampering in Britain, where some 300 cases of
contamination were reported, including food found with glass
shards, razor blades and caustic soda.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, visiting his
third Southeast Asian country in as many days, discussed economic
issues and the future of Cambodia in get-acquainted meetings with
Thai officials today.
   Quayle was greeted with a 19-gun salute when he arrived here for
a 1{-day stay that will include a tour Thursday of a border camp
for nearly 60,000 Cambodian refugees about 200 miles from Bangkok.
   The fate of Cambodia has been a dominant theme during the vice
president's 12-day tour of Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand. In Jakarta, Indonesia, he met with Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the Cambodian resistence leader whom the United States
wants to head a transition goverment after Vietnam withdraws its
occupation troops this fall.
   Quayle said at a news conference today that the United States
will not consider closer diplomatic ties with Vietnam until that
country ``removes itself from Cambodia.''
   Part of Quayle's responsibility on his trip is to gather ideas
from other Asian nations on Cambodia, and report back to President
Bush, whose administration is reassessing its policy towards Phnom
Penh. Among the options are providing military aid to the
non-communist factions seeking to take over in Cambodia.
   Quayle explained the basic U.S. position on Cambodia during a
50-minute meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and
also stressed the importance the United States places on protection
of copyrights _ perhaps the only major friction in otherwise strong
relations between the two countries.
   Earlier this year, the United States, Thailand's major export
market, denied the country $165 million in duty-free exports. The
action was taken after Washington complained the Thais had failed
to honor intellectual property rights, for instance copying
patented drugs.
   The United States is weighing whether to further blunt Thai
exports by imposing additional trade restrictions.
   Thai government spokesman Suvit Yoadmanee quoted Chatichai as
telling Quayle the United States should not take drastic action on
the issue because overall relations, including anti-narcotics
cooperation, were good. He noted that most recent negotiations had
gone well.
   Chatichai, according to Suvit, said the United States should
regard Thailand as a ``springboard'' for trade with Indochina and
Burma and noted there was room for increases in trade and joint
ventures between Thailand and the United States.
   Quayle also conferred with Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and
had an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The vice president
and his wife, Marilyn, were to be guests at a banquet tonight.
   While Quayle met with the prime minister, a half-dozen
university students attempted to hand to the vice president an open
letter protesting any implementation of further restrictions,
claiming it would amount to ``overt intervention of Thailand's
internal affairs.''
   Thai security kept the students from entering Government House,
where Quayle and Chatichai were meeting, and the students
circulated the letter among reporters and others.
   Deputy Prime Minister Pong Sarasin said he was ``more relaxed
than 30 days ago after having received reports about the latest
status of negotiations on trade-related issues.''
   Quayle arrived here from Singapore. He leaves Thursday for
Alaska where he will monitor clean-up efforts from the March 24
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound.
   In Singapore, Quayle met with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew during
a visit designed to strengthen ties between the United States and
the island republic.
   Quayle said Tuesday's meeting with Lee was fruitful and the two
discussed ``every single issue I can imagine.''
   He said he was impressed by Singapore's ``economic miracle ...
and booming economy.''
   Quayle also saw Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's defense minister and
deputy prime minister.
   At that session, Quayle raised the subject of the Singapore
government's restrictions on the circulation of the U.S.-owned
Asian Wall Street Journal and Far Eastern Economic Review,
according to Goh's private secretary, Tan Jee Say.
   ``I did bring this up,'' Quayle said afterward. ``We have a
difference of opinion on this .... We still hope that they will
change,'' but he added it was up to the Singapore government.
   Goh reiterated his government's position that foreign newspapers
are circulated in Singapore ``not as a right, but as a privilege
granted by the government on terms set by the government,''
according to Tan.
   The government allows papers to circulate in Singapore so long
as they do not engage in domestic politics, Goh said.
   In 1987, the Singapore government severely restricted the
circulation of both publications, a move that prompted the Far
Eastern Economic Review to shut down all distribution here.
   Editors from both papers have denied allegations by the
Singapore government that they meddled in local government.
   Restrictions on the press as well as human rights concerns have
strained U.S.-Singapore relations at times over the past years.
Last year, Singapore expelled an American diplomat, claiming that
he was interfering in domestic politics in his contacts with the
opposition.
   Washington denied that charge. It also has criticized Singapore
in the past for detaining political opponents.
   While in Singapore the vice president also played golf, his
second stint on the greens of his Asia-Pacific trip. The round was
cut short after five holes because of rain.

<HEAD>Novelist Says Science, by Ignoring Language, Is `Incoherent'</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release 8 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Walker Percy said Wednesday that
modern science is ``radically incoherent'' because it has failed to
bridge the gap between mind and matter by recognizing the
importance of human language.
   Delivering the 18th annual Jefferson Lecture of the National
Endowment for the Humanities, Percy urged creating a new ``science
of man'' that focuses on the words and meanings of language, the
only place, he said, where mind and matter intersect.
   ``We do not find it odd that there is only one science of
chemistry and neurology but, at last count, more than 600 different
schools of psychotherapy, and growing,'' Percy said in text of his
speech.
   ``We accept the explanation that, after all, the mind is vastly
more complicated than a molecule of sodium chloride or even a nerve
cell,'' he said.
   ``That may be true, but it doesn't explain why the physical
sciences are converging whereas the psychic `sciences' are
diverging; that is, getting nuttier,'' he said.
   Percy, an award-winning novelist from New Orleans and a former
physician, delivered his lecture, titled ``The Fateful Rift: The
San Andreas Fault in the Modern Mind,'' before 1,000 invited guests.
   The Jefferson Lecture, given by an eminent scholar every year
since 1972, is the highest federal honor for outstanding
achievement in the humanities. It carries a stipend of $10,000.
   Percy said science ignores or fails to deal with the relation
between the human mind and the physical world. Contemporary
psychology, he says, deals with visible, measurable entities such
as neurons and synapses and mental phenomena such as ``self'' or
``ego'' without linking them.
   However, he said, ``an increasing number of people are beginning
to know that a different sort of reality lies at the heart of all
uniquely human activity _ speaking, listening, understanding,
thinking, looking at art.''
   Percy said this reality, ``man's unique behavior of language and
symbol-mongering,'' eventually must be confronted by science as a
natural phenomenon that explains humanity.
   Art, poetry and novels ``ought to be taken very seriously
indeed, since these are the cognitive, scientific ... statements
that we have about what it is to be human,'' Percy said.
   ``The humanities, in a word, are not the minstrels of the age
whose only role is to promise `R &amp; R' to tired technicians and
consumers after work,'' he said.
   ``Rather are the humanities the elder brother of the sciences,
who sees how the new scientist got his tail in a crack when he
takes on the human subject as object and who even shows him the
shape of a new science.''

   Thursday is ``Tax Freedom Day.'' Once you put
in your eight hours, you'll be working for yourself the rest of the
year.
   The Tax Foundation calculates the average American will have to
work 124 days this year _ the same as in 1987 and 1988 _ just to
pay federal, state and local taxes. Thursday is the 124th day of
the year.
   Tax Freedom Day has never fallen later in the year. This year's
date is also the same as in 1981, before President Reagan and
Congress agreed on a 23-percent across-the-board cut in individual
income tax rates.
   Economists for the foundation, a nonpartisan Washington research
group, say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a
dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and
local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs.
   The foundation's calculations are based on the assumption that
all taxes, including those collected by businesses, ultimately are
paid by individuals.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez today ordered
pay raises of 30 percent to 70 percent for public employees and the
military after his overwhelming victory in presidential and
congressional elections.
   The salaries of brigadier generals will jump 70 percent, from
$448 to $761 a month. Captains' salaries will go from $248 to $421,
and sergeants will earn $209, up from $123.
   Rodriguez, who toppled dictator Alfredo Stroessner in a coup
Feb. 3, also announced 30 percent pay raises for public employees
and 49 percent increases for workers in clinics and hospitals.
   On Tuesday, Rodriguez announced the retirement of up to three
dozen army generals, some of them Stroessner loyalists, as part of
a shakeup to allow younger officers to move up in rank.
   ``Within a few days, or within the month of May, I'll give you
the list of those who have left (retired) and those who have been
promoted to general,'' Rodriguez told reporters as he left the
National Palace.
   The Central Electoral Board said today that of 898,829 votes
counted so far, Rodriguez received 667,434, or slightly more than
74 percent.
   His governing Colorado Party won control of Congress in the vote.
   ``I am pleased and happy that I have the affection of the
people, and they showed their confidence in me,'' Rodriguez said
when asked about the results.
   Some losers fumed about voting irregularities, but Paraguayans
seemed satisfied with the triumph of Rodriguez, a longtime
Stroessner aide who has respected civil liberties and promised
democratic reforms since taking power.
   ``You couldn't expect any other result because the people are
very grateful to him for putting his life in danger to bring us
freedom,'' said Susana Jara, 50, a fruit vendor in the public
market.
   ``Half of the vote for Rodriguez was a `thank you' for
overthrowing Stroessner,'' said Aldo Zuccolillo, editor of the
newspaper ABC Color that reopened last March after being shut down
five years ago by the former regime.
   Fernando Vera, presidential candidate of the Revolutionary
Febrerista Party, noted the election's many ``irregularities,'' but
said Rodriguez obviously won ``by a landslide.''
   Rodriguez has pledged to support reforms of the Constitution,
electoral law and the penal code. He also promised not to seek
re-election in 1993.
   The balloting was to choose a successor to finish the five-year
terms of Stroessner, who now lives in Brazil, and the Congress that
Rodriguez dissolved after the coup.
   The partial, official tally gave the governing Colorado Party
67.2 percent of the vote for the 36-member Senate and the 72-member
Chamber of Deputies. Unofficial tallies gave the Colorados, in
power since 1947, similar winning margins.
   The runner-up in the presidential balloting, Domingo Laino of
the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, has complained of ``shameful
irregularities'' in the voting. On Tuesday, he met with other party
leaders to decide whether to issue a protest.
   Flaws cited by international election observers and party
officials included lack of space for voting in private, lack of
indelible ink to prevent multiple voting, and apparently illegal,
last-minute registrations by the Colorados.
   ``The conduct of the elections was far from perfect,'' the
Washington-based National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs said in a statement.
   The group, an arm of the Democratic Party, noted the short time
to prepare and the country's history of authoritarian rule.
Widespread vote fraud occurred during the eight elections won by
Stroessner in his nearly 35 years of rule.
   The inauguration of Rodriguez and the Congress was set for May
15.

   These are troubled times for American apple
producers, says the Agriculture Department.
   Recent concern about apples treated with Alar and other
chemicals is part of the problem for growers, but so is the
expansion in apple production, both domestically and worldwide.
   ``Adding to the pressure, consumers could have cut demand for
apples as health concerns arose of the use of the pesticide Alar,''
says economist Amy Sparks. ``It remains to be seen if Alar use will
permanently curtail consumer demand.''
   Domestic demand for apples is ``relatively flat'' right now,
while competition in the international market is intensifying,
Sparks writes in the May issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   ``If demand does not increase, many U.S. producers may be forced
to leave the business,'' she said.
   The USDA, Food and Drug Administration and other government
agencies have declared the U.S. apple supply safe to eat. But the
recent Alar scare raised questions about the safety of apples
treated with the chemical, prompting a number of schools across the
country to temporarily ban apples from lunchrooms.
   Sparks, who works for the department's Economic Research
Service, said new plantings in the late 1970s and early 1980s are
pushing up U.S. apple production. A new planting comes into
production in 5 or 6 years and reaches nearly full capacity after 8
or 9 years.
   ``When the new plantings begin bearing at full capacity, output
will be comparable to 1987, the largest crop in U.S. history,'' she
said.
   Total production in 1987 _ the marketing year runs from July
through the following June _ was a record 4.8 million metric tons,
up from 3.6 million tons in each of the two previous years. The
preliminary estimate for 1988 is 4 million tons.
   Sparks said the decline for 1988 is due to the drought in some
areas, and because apples, like most tree crops, are cyclical.
After a year of high yields, production is smaller the following
year. Also, although new trees are coming into production, other
orchards are growing older and are yielding less.
   One factor has been a deterioration in the U.S. apple trade
balance, she said. Imports reached 121,000 tons in 1987-88, more
than double the volume of the mid-1970s. Part of the reason was the
sharp drop in the value of Chile's peso against the dollar, which
lowered the price of Chilean apples.
   Meanwhile, U.S. fresh apple exports rose to 305,000 tons in
1980-81 from 120,063 tons in 1976-77. However, exports declined
after 1980-81 when the dollar began rising against vitually all
U.S. apple importers.
   ``Exports for the 1987-88 marketing year, at 293,000 tons, were
70 percent higher than the previous year,'' Sparks said. ``This was
partly due to the low prices induced by the record crop and partly
due to the U.S. dollar's decline during 1985-87.''
   Sparks said that a number of countries, including Chile, New
Zealand and South Africa, have been boosting apple production and
exports. These Southern Hemisphere producers are able to export
fresh apples while the United States is drawing on its cold storage
supplies.
   The major export markets for U.S. apples are Canada, the
European Economic Community and the Far East, she said. In each the
United States faces comptition from the three Southern Hemisphere
countries.
   But some important markets are opening up for American producers
in the Far East, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand,
the Philippines and Japan.
   Sweden has agreed to open its market earlier for U.S. apples.
Previously, imports were allowed only when local supplies were
exhausted, usually by mid-December, Sparks said. In 1989-90, the
opening date will be Nov. 15, and in future years will be open year
round.

   Heavy rains have helped the western Corn Belt
and nothern Great Plains, but much of the sorely damaged winter
wheat area is still parched from lack of moisture, says the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility.
   Winter wheat was in ``mostly fair to poor'' condition during the
final week of April, particularly in the central and southern areas
of the plains, the facility said Tuesday in a weekly report.
However, rain helped improve winter wheat in the northern Great
Plains.
   The facility is operated by the department's of Agriculture and
Commerce. No yield estimates are included in the report's
assessment of crop and soil conditions.
   ``In Kansas, high temperatures and wind stressed winter wheat,''
the report said. ``Condition was mostly very poor to poor. Crop
development was poor in most fields. In Texas, winter wheat was
mostly fair to poor.''
   Lack of moisture continued to put stress on Nebraska's winter
wheat, and crop condition was reported as mostly poor to fair. Rain
improved the crop in Montana and South Dakota.
   Rain slowed planting of spring wheat, which was far behind the
normal progress for this time of season. In North Dakota, planting
was 16 percent complete, 23 percentage points behind normal.
   But corn planting spurted ahead sharply, reaching 25 percent
completion, a 17-point advance from the week before, the report
said. Producers planted over a third of their corn acreage in
Illinois, Kansas and Missouri during the week.

<HEAD>Artist Learns the Pitfalls of Crossing Political Barriers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louise Walsh tried to teach the
Belfast City Council about art, and instead learned about the
pitfalls of trying to work with all parties in Northern Ireland.
   The 26-year-old artist's first commission _ a bronze sculpture
commemorating the red-light past of downtown Belfast _ proved too
much for the city's Protestant elders, and it expired in a
political wrangle that fractured normal Protestant-Catholic lines.
   Councillor Rhonda Paisley, daughter of Protestant firebrand Rev.
Ian Paisley, liked it. So did Lily Fitzsimmons of Sinn Fein, the
party that supports the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army.
   But other councillors protested that prostitutes were being
glorified and sainted mothers insulted, or that the statue had been
hijacked by IRA supporters.
   ``I thought I'd done so well,'' said Miss Walsh who, dispirited
by the whole experience, found solace at the Crown, a grand old
gaslit pub near the place where her sculpture was to stand.
   Miss Walsh, a native of County Cork in the Irish Republic,
envisioned a bronze sculpture of two women, one 7 feet tall and the
other a bit shorter, both chastely dressed.
   The working-women theme would be expressed by making one figure
out of balls of wool, knitting, a scrub brush and clothespins, and
the other out of sewing machines, telephones, cash registers and
typewriters.
   She got her first inkling of trouble when councillor Frank
Millar reviewed a model.
   ``I was told,'' he said, ``that the figure showed the women's
breasts, but I couldn't say. It was made out of old bits of tin and
my eyesight's not so good.''
   Millar's opinion counted because he chaired the Parks Committee,
which would review the proposal. Sensing danger, Miss Walsh decided
to take her case to every party on the committee.
   ``I was innocently _ I mean, quite genuinely _ trying to explain
to people it was not a glorification of prostitution,'' Miss Walsh
said.
   She said she told the committee the sculpture aimed ``to comment
on women's work: both badly paid and unpaid. The 10 worst-paid jobs
in the United Kingdom are jobs traditionally done by women,'' and
such pressures could drive some women into prostitution.
   One councillor who agreed was Mrs. Fitzsimmons, who saw it as
``a tribute to working-class women.'' Miss Paisley, herself a
painter, also praised it.
   This uncommon agreement between a Paisley unionist committed to
Britain, and an IRA supporter pledged to driving Britain out of
Northern Ireland, was more than Belfast headline writers could
resist. At that point, as the Belfast political journal
``Fortnight'' put it, ``unionist knees jerked.''
   Millar's committee concluded that most people would see the
sculpture as a memorial to prostitution and an insult to working
women _ his mother among them _ who ``despite poverty retained high
moral standards.''
   That set the stage for Tuesday's battle in the council hall,
whose aisle separates 51 Protestant and Catholic councillors into
two arrays of factions which feud with each other as well as within
themselves.
   Hard-line Democratic Unionists like Miss Paisley sit with more
moderate Ulster Unionists like Millar, plus two Independent
Unionists, one Protestant Unionist and one Progressive Unionist.
The Catholics are divided among the moderate Social Democratic and
Labor Party, its avowed enemy Sinn Fein, and one member of the
radical left-wing Workers Party.
   A half-dozen members of the Alliance, the only mixed
Catholic-Protestant party, fit in where they can. Protestant
councillors have been known to blow rape whistles to drown out Sinn
Fein opponents, or to toss coins at each other as ``Judas''
gestures.
   Tuesday's session was mild by these standards, with Miss Paisley
excoriating Millar as well as Mrs. Fitzsimmons ``who sits with the
IRA-Sinn Fein scum.''
   ``I congratulate Louise Walsh for her work because it has
exposed the stench of religious hypocrisy surrounding the arts for
too long,'' Miss Paisley said.
   ``I would prefer,'' said Ulster Unionist Jim Kirkpatrick, ``to
see a statue of women bringing up children alone due to the
murderous activities of Sinn Fein.''
   Former Lord Mayor Sammy Wilson of the Democratic Unionist Party
said the debate ``has been full of cant and hypocrisy, and has more
to do with people looking for a cheap election gimmick.''
   Whatever Rhonda Paisley thought, Millar said her father had
joined three other ministers in signing a letter opposing the
sculpture.
   ``The letter made it quite clear it was opposed to the erection
_ that was the term they used _ of the statue,'' Millar said.
   A motion to support the statue, and condemn Sinn Fein in the
bargain, failed 22-13.

   Dozens of journalists for the official media
began a petition drive Wednesday and made plans to demonstrate in
an unprecedented open rebellion against government censorship.
   The reporters demanded the reinstatement of the editor of
China's most outspoken newspaper, who was fired last week.
   But they also called for a dialogue with government officials on
broader issues of censorship, reflecting increasing dissatisfaction
with a media system in which much of their work is never released.
   The reporters, many of whom are members of the ruling Communist
Party, said their action was prompted in part by tight government
limits on reporting of student protests over the past few weeks.
The students have called for press freedom and other democratic
reforms, but only a few newspapers have reported the scale and
popularity of their marches.
   ``We all know there is no press freedom in our country, and that
we reporters all want press freedom,'' a reporter for the Economic
Studies Weekly told a gathering of about 60 colleagues at the Lu
Xun Museum in Beijing.
   Lu Xun was a short story writer and essayist famous for his
sharp criticism of the government in the 1920s and 1930s.
   The reporters, from all of China's leading papers including the
party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, expressed anger over the
firing of Qin Benli, editor of the Shanghai-based weekly, the World
Economic Herald.
   Shanghai officials fired Qin for ``violations of discipline''
after he refused to alter the paper's April 24 edition. The issue
contained articles that called for a reassessment of late party
chief Hu Yaobang, who was ousted in 1987 allegedly for being too
liberal. Shanghai officials said the articles were ``likely to
cause disturbances.''
   Hu's death April 15 sparked marches, sit-ins and a class boycott
by tens of thousands of college students in the largest protest in
40 years of communist rule.
   The reporters drafted a letter to be sent to government and
party leaders demanding Qin's reinstatement, an open apology by
Shanghai officials and a dialogue with officials on ``illegal
interference'' in reporting.
   ``If we can achieve our goals regarding the World Economic
Herald, then we believe we will have advanced a step in our
striving for press freedom in our country,'' said the Economic
Studies Weekly reporter, who like many others did not want his name
used.
   The reporters at the meeting promised to collect signatures at
their workplaces.
   They also made plans to demonstrate Thursday outside the offices
of the state-run Xinhua News Agency, which generally sets the line
for other official media to follow in reporting sensitive stories.
   Thursday is the 70th anniversary of a 1919 student protest that
began what became known as the May Fourth Movement, a campaign
against foreign imperialism and for scientific and democratic
reform. It was China's first student protest.
   The current student protesters have carried banners declaring,
``The press should speak the truth,'' and shouted, ``The People's
Daily, complete nonsense!''
   ``It's exciting. The intellectuals in China won't stand more
pressure from the government,'' said a TV journalist. ``There is
strict censorship every day.''
   She said reports were held up for hours, sometimes days, by
``lots of officials who want to say yes or no'' on each one, even
if the content is not particularly sensitive.
   Science and Technology Daily was the first to break a media
blackout on the student protests when it said that students
gathered to mourn Hu also were chanting slogans for democracy and
freedom. The paper's editors agreed to publish the report only
after the reporters threatened to resign en masse.
   The Peasant's Daily, Beijing Youth News and Chinese Women's News
each have reported once on the protests with enough detail to give
readers an idea of the unprecedented size and daringness of them.
Other papers have carried only sparse, understated Xinhua reports.
   Dozens of Chinese reporters have covered the protests, but said
their editors have tossed out their reports.
   One photographer, asked at a protest why he was bothering to
take pictures, replied: ``For history.''

   America's people, statistically speaking, are
a just shade older than they've ever been before, with the median
age in the United States reaching a record 32.3 years, the Census
Bureau reported Wednesday.
   That means half of all the people living in the country were
older than 32.3 years, and half younger, as of last July 1. This is
up from the median age of 32.1 a year earlier.
   By states, in terms of the median age, Nebraska and North
Carolina are in the middle while the oldest Americans are in
Florida and the youngest in Utah.
   The maturing of the massive Baby Boom generation, born in the
years following World War II, is raising the nation's median age,
census officials and other analysts have noted.
   This group forms the largest segment of the population and as it
ages the median age is pulled along, Census demographer Ed Byerly
said in a telephone interview.
   After years of climbing gradually as life spans increased, the
median age reached 30 for the first time in the 1950 census, when
it was 30.2 years.
   But then the full force of the Baby Boom began to occur and the
large number of children in the population pulled the median down
for two decades.
   In 1980, the median edged back up to 30 again and has continued
climbing since then, as the Baby Boomers pursued careers and
education and postponed having families, creating what some
statisticians call a Baby Bust.
   In the last few years, total births have begun rising as aging
Baby Boomers began having children, but those numbers remain too
small to have a major impact on the national median, Byerly said.
   Retirement-haven Florida remains the state with the oldest
population, with a median age of 36.4 years, up from 36.3 years in
1987.
   Following Florida, the highest median ages were reported for the
large industrial states in the Northeast, with New Jersey second at
34.5 years followed by Connecticut and Pennsylvania at 34.4.
   Indeed, the Northeast has the highest median age of the four
regions at 33.9 years. Next is the Midwest at 32.3 _ same as the
national figure _ followed by the South, 32; and the West, 31.6.
   The state with the youngest residents remains Utah, where half
of the population is under 25.7 years, and half over. A year
earlier, Utah's median age was 25.5.
   Next lowest is Alaska, with a median figure of 28.7 years.
   Two states, Nebraska and North Carolina, match the national
median age, while the populations of 20 states and the District of
Columbia are older than the nation as a whole. The remaining 28
states have median ages younger than that of the country.
   Here is a look at the nation's median age through the years:

   A military jet crashed today during a
training flight, and the pilot died from injuries suffered when he
ejected moments before the plane went down, Marines Corps officials
said.
   The single-seat AV-8 Harrier crashed about 9 a.m. near a
training airfield at the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot near
Beaufort, Marine spokesman 1st Lt. Arnold John Kozloski said.
   The pilot died later at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Beaufort,
authorities said.
   The pilot, whose name was withheld pending notification of
relatives, was assigned to the 2nd Marine Aviation Wing at Cherry
Point Marine Air Station in North Carolina, Kozloski said.
   The pilot was one of 25,600 Marines and sailors participating in
the ``Solid Shield '89'' training exercise, which began today along
the East Coast and is scheduled to run until May 20.
   The Harrier jet, capable of vertical take-offs and landings, had
taken off from Page Field at Parris Island, Kozloski said.
   No weapons or explosives were aboard the jet, which crashed 100
feet from the end of the runway and sparked a fire, Kozloski said.
   No injuries were reported on the ground and the fire was brought
under control, Kozloski said.
   Three pilots have died in 14 Harrier jet crashes since May 1988,
said 1st Lt. Tamara Skipton at Cherry Point, where all the U.S.
military's Harrier jets are based.
   The jet's predecessor, the AV-8C, was introduced by McDonald
Aircraft Co. in 1969 and used by the British during the Falkland
Islands war.

   A parasitic worm that causes millions of dollars'
damage to livestock in the Americas has been found in North Africa
and threatens that entire continent, the Middle East and southern
Europe, a U.N. agency said Wednesday.
   Edouard Saouma, director-general of the Food and Agriculture
Organization, notified 37 countries the American screwworm ``could
have disastrous consequences to livestock, wildlife and perhaps
even human populations.''
   The agency said the screwworm is one of the most drastic insect
pests in the Western Hemisphere, costing farmers hundreds of
millions of dollars a year.
   The screwworm is the larva of a blowfly which infests wounds and
apertures like nostrils, breeding there and debilitating
warm-blooded animals. They can die without treatment.
   U.N. experts said they do not know how the parasite reached
North Africa.

   The third strong earthquake in less than a month
shook southwest China's Sichuan province on Wednesday, injuring two
road workers, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   It said the workemen were digging a ditch when they were hit by
a rockslide, but did not say how seriously they were hurt.
   The quake was centered near Batang County, which was the
epicenter of strong earthquakes on April 16 and April 25 that
killed 11 people.
   The latest earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale,
signifying a quake capable of causing severe damage in a populated
area. The scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. The two
earlier quakes each measured 6.7 on the scale.
   The highway linking Sichuan's capital of Chengdu to Batang was
blocked by a rockslide and two trucks carrying relief materials
were hit by rocks, Xinhua said.
   It said no one was killed in the quake because residents had
been warned to expect further temblors.
   China's worst earthquake in 12 years struck Yunnan province
south of Sichuan on Nov. 6 and killed 730 people.

<HEAD>Productivity Up 0.5 Percent for First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business productivity rose at an annual rate
of 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 1989, with manufacturing
workers significantly increasing their per-hour output, the
government reported Wednesday.
   Overall output in non-farm business rose at a rate of 3.6
percent in the first quarter while hours worked climbed 3.1
percent, leaving the half-percent productivity gain, the Labor
Department said. The department revised the fourth-quarter non-farm
productivity gain to an annual rate of 1 percent, up from the 0.1
percent initially reported.
   All of the figures were seasonally adjusted.
   The gains were marked in manufacturing: Productivity improved
3.8 percent in the first quarter from the final three months of
1988 because manufacturing workers increased their output by 4.6
percent while the number of hours worked grew by only 0.8 percent.
   The data essentially confirmed figures in the government's
recent reports on the gross national product and employment costs.
   Productivity _ output per hour for all workers _ is an indicator
of the efficiency of American business. Because of labor shortages,
particularly in skilled jobs, economists have been predicting wages
will rise faster and significant productivity gains will be needed
to curb inflation.
   Still, there were signs in Wednesday's report that wage gains
are not outpacing inflation in general.
   The Labor Department reported that hourly compensation in
non-farm business rose 5.7 percent in the first quarter but real
hourly compensation, which takes into account the increase in
consumer prices in that period, grew by only 0.3 percent. For all
of 1988, hourly compensation adjusted to factor in consumer
inflation rose a revised 0.4 percent, the department said.
   In manufacturing, real hourly compensation lagged 0.6 percent
behind inflation in 1988 and 1.2 percent behind in the first
quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 1988, according to the
government data.
   In a separate gauge, the government reported that unit labor
costs _ obtained by dividing compensation by output _ rose 5.2
percent in the first quarter from the previous three months and 4.9
percent compared to the first quarter of 1988.
   The improved productivity in manufacturing in the first quarter
included a gain of 3.6 percent for durable goods and 4 percent for
non-durables.
   The report included revised productivity data for 1988, with the
government reporting overall non-farm productivity improved 1.5
percent over the year as output increased 5.2 percent while total
hours worked grew 3.7 percent.
   The government reported overall business productivity _
including farming _ increased at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, but that figure is heavily influenced by the
agricultural rebound after last year's drought. Productivity had
declined 1 percent in the overall business category in the final
quarter of 1988.

   Thirteen infants died in a two-week period in an
Armenian hospital where cockroaches scuttled around the cabinets
and doctors set mousetraps under the operating table, a newspaper
revealed.
   In a blistering attack that accused officials of indifference,
incompetence and a coverup, the Armenian newspaper Kommunist said
25 children born at the Krupskaya Scientific-Research Institute in
the capital of Yerevan had died this year, including 13 alone in
the first two weeks of March.
   In another Yerevan maternity hospital, three children died
because they were given overdoses of medicine, according to the
April 29 edition of the newspaper that reached Moscow on Wednesday.
   A government commission established that many of the infants
died of infections caused by unsanitary conditions ``on the
operating table, in the birth area, in areas for premature babies,
on nipples, oxygen masks, breathing tubes, and even on medical
lamps.''
   ``Mothers say: cockroaches scuttle around the cabinets and under
the operating table there is a mousetrap,'' Kommunist reported.
   The commission determined that about half of the 13 children who
died in March were among the highest-risk group of newborns, but
that ``at least five or six of these children did not have to
die,'' the newspaper said.
   It said nothing about the 12 other children born at the
institute who have died this year.
   The paper said the institute was closed, its director, G.G.
Okoev, was fired, and other senior personnel were demoted.
   In an earlier interview, the paper said Okoev had blamed the
high death rate on the high-risk nature of its patients and a flu
epidemic among the mothers.
   Citing the case of the three other children who were given
overdoses of medicine, the newspaper demanded: ``Is this
coincidence, or is it the system? A deeper and more serious
discussion is needed here.''
   After many years of not publishing such statistics, the official
press said a year ago the infant mortality rate was about 25 per
1,000 live births. In some areas of Central Asia, it is as high as
70 per 1,000. The infant mortality rate in the United States in
1986 was 10.3 per 1,000.
   The report came after other reports of abuse and neglect in
recent months at maternity hospitals that shocked Soviets.
   Officials said in March that 49 mothers and babies had been
infected with the AIDS virus at a hospital in Elista by nurses who
used unsterile syringes.
   Soviet officials acknowledge the free system of health care
often is poor, and they are putting more money aside to improve it.
The Tass news agency Wednesday quoted Health Minister Yevgeny
Chazov as saying that much of that money would be targeted at care
for mothers and children.
   ``Considering the lag of mother and child care centers, it has
been decided to spend 40 percent of public health's capital
investments for the development of these institutions,'' Tass said.
   It said there has been a drop in infant mortality and infectious
diseases in the past two years.
   But Kommunist said the infant deaths at the Yerevan institute
were not so much caused by lack of good equipment as the
indifference of hospital and city health workers.
   ``Out of dozens of people in responsible positions, receiving a
salary precisely to spot dangerous infections on time, no one saw
it _ even when children started to die from it,'' the paper said.
   ``How could it happen that they didn't notice a group infection,
and in the end the deaths of a group of children, they didn't know?
Or maybe they knew, but kept silent? Maybe they simply were afraid
to lose their comfortable chairs, where it is very prestigious to
sit?'' it said.
   ``In any case, such inertia is deeply immoral, if not
criminal,'' it said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today played
down an apparent disparity between his assessment of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's chances of implementing reforms and
the opinion held by President Bush.
   ``The president and I were in a meeting yesterday and frankly
chuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on views
that we have expressed. We do not perceive a significant difference
in terms of our views of the situation with respect to the Soviet
Union,'' Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The defense secretary, who has been on the job for less than two
months, created a stir last week when he predicted that Gorbachev
would fail at instituting reforms in the Soviet Union and would be
replaced by a hardliner.
   ``If I had to guess today, I would guess ultimately he would
fail,'' Cheney said in a weekend television interview.
   He also said the United States should not take any unilateral
steps, such as removing any of the 324,000 U.S. troops stationed in
Western Europe, in response to changes in the Soviet Union.
   Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and White House
chief of staff John Sununu quickly offered more hopeful assessments
about Gorbachev's liberalization efforts, although they did not
publicly rebuke Cheney.
   The defense secretary conceded today that he ``responded
previously the other day perhaps with more candor than was
warranted about my view ... somewhat pessimistic concerning Mr.
Gorbachev's prospect for achieving his reforms.''
   ``The president has expressed the hope those reforms will be
successful. We don't see those ... as contradictory statements,''
Cheney said.
   Asked by Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
Armed Services Committee, whether there was a fundamental
difference between Bush's approach to defense and his own, Cheney
replied, ``This is his budget I presented today.''

   Desperate times call for desperate measures
in the Oral Roberts ministry as the elder statesman of television
evangelism struggles to raise more than $4 million by Saturday to
save his religious empire.
   Roberts said in late March he had five weeks to raise $11
million to pay past-due bills or creditors would ``start
dismantling'' the ministry. Richard Roberts, the evangelist's son,
said more than $4 million still is needed by Saturday, when Oral
Roberts University graduates nearly 1,000 of its 4,300 students.
   Roberts announced Tuesday he was pulling the university's
athletic teams out of NCAA competition and applying for admission
in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics to save
money. He estimated that would save $500,000 to $1 million a year.
   Roberts, who once said nationally ranked NCAA teams could help
showcase his evangelical university, said the decision was an
indication to supporters of the sacrifices necessary to save the
ministry.
   ``When they see that I've made this painful decision, I think
they will realize how serious our problem is and will come
through,'' he told the Tulsa World.
   The decision, effective immediately, ended the chances of
post-season tournament play for the university's 36-18 baseball
team, which had hopes of a regional playoff bid with six games left
in the season.
   ``To work that long and that hard and to have an outside force
come in and take it away from you, that's hard,'' said Brett Louis,
a sophomore catcher and designated hitter.
   ``We've been facing the worst financial crisis in the history of
this ministry,'' Richard Roberts said. ``We're not out here in
Tulsa crying wolf. We've got a sincere problem.''
   There have been other financial crises that forced cutbacks.
   Roberts dropped the university's law school in 1985 and dental
school in 1986, and turned over the City of Faith Medical Center's
clinic operation to an independent doctor's group in 1987. Last
year the ministry took its television programs off 125 stations and
the university scaled down an $8 million scholarship program for
medical students.
   ``Everybody misses one large point,'' said Mark Swadener, chief
financial officer for the ministry. ``They think we like to raise
money. It is absolutely the opposite. We don't like to come to you
and ask for money. We don't like to come to you because we don't
want to be your problem. We want to be your solution.''
   Roberts blames the well-publicized sins of fellow evangelists
Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart for his ministry's woes. Citing a
``spirit of skepticism'' that has discouraged the once-faithful,
Roberts claims donations have tumbled steadily since the 1987
scandal involving Bakker and his PTL ministry from $5 million a
month to $2.7 million.
   But Roberts has had his share of controversy in his 41-year-old
ministry, including claims of seeing a 900-foot Jesus, wrestling
matches with the devil and a life-or-death ultimatum from God to
raise $8 million for the medical school scholarship program in 1987.
   Nevertheless, the 71-year-old tent preacher who pioneered
television evangelism says he is willing to pay any price to bring
supporters back to his ministry.
   ``This is an awful thing for me to say, but I'd be willing to
lose my soul, I believe, to save Oral Roberts University,'' he said.
   Roberts, who built his $500 million evangelical kingdom on the
credo ``Expect A Miracle,'' has managed to meet the challenge more
than once in the last several years.
   He has raised more than $20 million in special appeals since
1986, including his controversial $8 million fund raiser that ended
in March 1987 after he said God would ``call me home'' if he failed.
   Richard Roberts said he believes the ministry will raise the
money it needs and he still plans to leave for the Soviet Union
next week on a six-day trip. ``I refuse to give up. I refuse to
turn loose,'' he said. ``I'm expecting a miracle for ORU.''

twice-a-day radiation, with or without chemotherapy, appears to be
one of the most promising approaches we have,'' Edward Shaw, a
radiation oncologist, told a seminar on smoking last weekend.
   The researchers have been studying the new approach for those
who are not good candidates for surgery since the summer of 1987.
   But the National Cancer Institute was hesitant Tuesday to
endorse the new treatment, saying the benefits must be shown to
outweigh the problems it could inflict.
   While ``it's definitely something that needs to be looked into
further,'' two-a-day treatments could disrupt patient's lives by
requiring them to remain hospitalized, said spokeswoman Kara Smigel.
   Those getting once-a-day treatment are usually outpatients and
can live relatively normal lives, she said.
   About 155,000 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 1989.
Of those, about two-thirds will not be good candidates for surgery.
   If patients receive two radiation treatments daily, lower doses
may spare the tissue surrounding fast-growing cancers, Shaw said.
Traditional radiation treatment for lung cancer calls for radiation
once a day, five days a week, for six weeks.
   That, said Shaw, will produce a 5 percent survival rate, meaning
5 percent of the patients receiving the treatment will be alive in
five years. Twenty percent will be alive after two years. The
average survival will be nine months.
   Most people die from the spread of the cancer to other areas,
such as the brain, liver and bones, Shaw said.
   ``I hate to get too excited too soon, but these people are doing
really well,'' Shaw said. ``This is probably the most exciting
potential development I have seen in inoperable lung cancer in
years.''
   A 20-patient pilot program using twice-a-day radiation will
begin in about six weeks. The next stage will be to compare
standard treatment with twice-a-day radiation and twice-a-day
radiation with chemotherapy. Researchers should have some idea of
the effectiveness of the treatment within four or five years.

   An adult community has won the
right to evict a toddler in a test of a federal law aimed at
preventing age discrimination in housing.
   Pasco Circuit Judge Lawrence Keough gave Vincent Malloy 30 days
to remove his son Johnny, who turns 2 this week, from Arborwood at
Summertree, a 289-unit community for adults 55 and older.
   After a three-hour non-jury trial, Keough decided Tuesday that
the subdivision fits exceptions to the newly amended Fair Housing
Act, which took effect March 12, and upheld the association's age
restriction as legal.
   The law includes exemptions for retirement communities if 80
percent of the households have at least one person age 55 or older
and if facilities and services are provided for them.
   Arborwood attorney Michael Brudny said the subdivision meets
both requirements.
   Malloy represented himself, saying he could have afforded a
lawyer but chose not to do so because others similarly affected
might not be able to afford one.
   ``To decide on their part, you're deciding against all the
people that Congress tried to protect with this law. And you're
also deciding against all the people 55 and up who like children,''
Malloy told the judge in his closing agrument.
   Malloy said he will honor the order and expects to move to
another home five miles away he has arranged to buy.
   He originally bought the $90,000 Arborwood home for his
80-year-old father, who died in December 1985 before the house was
finished. Malloy said he and his son moved to Arborwood last June
after he divorced the boy's mother. He said he lived there two
weeks before receiving notice from the homeowners group to move.
   Earlier this year, Keough rejected a bid by the association to
evict the child and said the subdivision's original restriction
against minors _ residents younger than 18 _ would become illegal
when the fair housing law took effect. The Arborwood association
amended its bylaws to become a 55-and-older community.

<TEXT>
   The former chancellor of the
University of California, Santa Barbara, continues to receive his
$6,800-a-month salary, 10 months after being convicted of
embezzling $250,000 in campus funds.
   A campus discipline review process has yet to decide the future
of Robert Huttenback, who was suspended indefinitely in September
as a tenured history professor.
   Many professors and students have expressed outrage that the
university continues to pay Huttenback.
   ``This year there are 2,400 freshmen who are unable to take
required freshman English courses because the university is too
short of money to provide those courses,'' said John Reiff, who
teaches freshman composition. ``So it's terribly puzzling and
distressing to pay a convicted felon for not teaching.''
   ``It's disgraceful that we continue to pay a man who has been
convicted of stealing from us,'' said student body President Javier
LaFianza.
   John Myers, chairman of the five-member Committee of Privilege
and Tenure, said the panel has not made a recommendation on
Huttenback because ``this is a very complicated matter that has to
be done with a great deal of thought.''
   Huttenback resigned as chancellor in July 1986 but continued to
teach history. He was later convicted of embezzlement and income
tax evasion in connection with embezzling school funds to make
repairs at his home.
   He was fined $60,000, placed on five years' probation and
ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service. He is
appealing his sentence.

<HEAD>Consultant Says Dust From Plant May Be Much Greater than Estimated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amount of radioactive dust released from a
uranium-processing plant in Ohio may be two to six times greater
than estimated because of ``inherently deceptive'' record-keeping,
a consultant said Wednesday.
   The consultant's report was prepared for a lawsuit to be heard
next month against the former operator of the Energy Department
plant at Fernald, Ohio, where the government says an extensive
cleanup effort will be required over the next decade.
   The plant, on 1,050 acres 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, has
processed uranium for nuclear weapons since 1952 during which the
government estimates as much as 552,000 pounds of radioactive
uranium dust may have been released into the air.
   But a report released Wednesday by the Institute for Energy and
Environmental Research said the government estimates are far too
low based on evidence gathered as part of the lawsuit from
depositions and internal plant documents.
   Arjun Makhijani, an engineer and co-author of the report, said
as much as 3.1 million pounds of uranium particles may have been
released from the plant since it opened in 1952. Even using
conservative estimates, the releases likely significantly exceed
the government estimates, he suggested.
   Chris Sankey, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said the
department does not necessarily dispute the group's figures, but
will not agree with them either. She said the department does not
want to discuss the new findings in detail because of the trial
scheduled to begin June 5.
   Officials of Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio, the plant's
current operator which officially took over operation in January
1986, declined comment on the consultant's report until the company
can get a copy and read it.
   The suit alleges that National Lead of Ohio, which had operated
the plant, created a health hazard and reduced property values near
the plant because of the release of radioactive particles.
   Makhijani said the higher estimates of radioactive releases over
37 years of plant operation are based on internal plant documents
and statements by officials and a computer analysis of
radioactivity levels in soil within a five-mile radius of the plant.
   ``The official estimates (cited so far by the government) of
cumulative releases of uranium to the air from this plant are based
in part on fabricated data and what plant documents themselves
describe as an `inherently deceptive' method of calculating'' some
of the releases, wrote Makhijani.
   The report cited a court deposition by Michael W. Boback, former
head of industrial hygiene and radiation at the plant, that stack
pollution filters regularly were not examined during long periods
of time, but ``zero loss'' of radioactive particles nevertheless
were entered into release records.
   The report said no adequate accounting was made of radioactive
releases from areas not specifically monitored, although internal
documents show such releases were much greater than estimated by
the government. One memo cites extensive concern about radioactive
dust leaking from equipment in areas not officially being monitored.
   ``A bucket was placed under the largest leak to help contain the
spilled dust'' from one piece of equipment, a memo says.
   A spot check showed releases from unmonitored areas in a single
month to exceed all releases attributed to such sources by the
government over the entire 37-year period, the report said.
   The report said releases from stack scrubbers were based on an
assumption that they were highly efficient and in good working
condition, although internal documents show scrubbers in disrepair
and corroding.
   ``We have long suspected that the stack and scrubber losses from
Plant 8 (one of the buildings at the facility) are far greater than
are reported by the Health and Safety Division,'' said a June 4,
1964, plant memo cited in the report. A 1970 memo referred to
problems with another scrubber which, it said, was ``badly corroded
and does not perform required scrubber functions.''
   A computer analysis of soil samples within five miles of the
plant, conducted as part of the consultant's investigation,
indicated levels of radiation on average eight times greater than
would be expected with the levels of release cited by the
government, said Makhijani.

<HEAD>Soviet: Importing Publications Just a `Commercial Issue'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Importing books and other publications to the
Soviet Union is ``purely a commercial'' proposition, unhindered by
political considerations, a high-ranking Soviet official said
Wednesday.
   Dmitry Mamleev, deputy head of the Soviet state committee for
publishing and the book trade, also said exchanges between
Americans and Soviets in the publishing world are booming thanks to
glasnost.
   ``There is no problem with political issues now,'' Mamleev said
at a news conference during a 35-nation forum on the flow of
information between East and West. ``This is purely a commercial
issue now.''
   Mamleev, who introduced himself as a journalist, said 12 joint
ventures have been created recently for distributing books. He
cited only Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Bulgarian examples of
cooperation, however.
   He denied that censorship existed in the Soviet Union, saying
the only ban was on publication of state secrets.
   Due to glasnost, the new Soviet policy of openness, all
publishing houses were ``independent,'' he said.
   Despite a paper shortage, he said, 2{ billion books and 84,000
new titles were being published every year.
   Speaking of exchanges with Americans, Mamleev said, ``two years
ago we started at a level below zero _ today I don't know how many
of my publishers are in the States, there are so many.''
   As part of the limited importation of foreign magazines and
newspapers begun last fall, he said 1,000 copies of Time magazine
recently went on sale.
   The newspaper USA Today is set to follow and his committee is
negotiating an exchange of the science magazine Omni for its Soviet
counterpart, Science in the U.S.S.R.
   Until recently, Soviet customs inspectors searched the bags of
arriving tourists to confiscate Western publications.
   On Tuesday, U.S. delegation member Judith Ingram criticized the
Soviet Union's decision to allow the public to attend the Moscow
International Book Fair in September for only two days of its seven
day-run.
   Ms. Ingram expressed U.S. concern that ``this period will not be
long enough to accommodate the many Soviet citizens who depend on
this biennial event to acquint themselves with world literature.''
   She also cited the case of Vladimir Ryabakon, a Russian Orthodox
Christian, whose religious literature was confiscated upon his
return to the Soviet Union in December, despite official Soviet
media articles announcing the lifting of all limitations on
importing such material.
   She said U.S. delegates hoped that the positive changes toward
freedom of expression seen in Poland, Hungary and ``to some
extent'' in the Soviet Union would also reach other East bloc
countries where they were needed, such as Bulgaria and Romania.
   The month-long conference, known as the Information Forum, ends
next week.

   President Bush today ruled out negotiations
with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear missiles, saying such
talks ``would be a mistake.''
   He said the weapons must be kept in West Germany and made more
powerful in order to deter Soviet attack.
   Bush outlined his position to Prime Minister Gro Harlem
Brundtland in an hour-long White House meeting. She stressed a need
to find ``commmon ground'' with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
who wants the missiles scaled back and eventually eliminated.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, suggested the disagreement
was not likely to be resolved before Bush, Kohl and the leaders of
the 14 other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries attend a
summit meeting in Brussels May 29-30.
   ``We will continue to discuss it but we are very firm in our
position,'' Fitzwater said.
   The centerpiece of the summit is celebration of the 40th
anniversary of the Western alliance. Fitzwater said ``we will have
a healthy debate'' if a solution remains elusive. But, he said, ``I
don't think it will damage the basic strength of NATO.''
   Quoting Bush, the spokesman said the president had told the
Norwegian leader that the short-range Lance missiles were
``essential'' to NATO's strategy of deterring an attack by the
Warsaw Pact and that ``such systems must be kept up to date.''
   Moreover, Fitzwater said, Bush told Mrs. Brundtland that
``entering into arms control negotiations on short-range nuclear
forces with the Soviet Union would be a mistake.''
   The statement appeared to rule out negotiations to eliminate the
Lances under any circumstances. Fitzwater said there could be no
consideration of such talks at least until after the Warsaw Pact
reduced its conventional forces in Europe.
   Mrs. Brundtland, taking an optimistic view, had predicted after
seeing Bush that the NATO allies would find a ``common ground''
between conflicting U.S. and West German positions on the
short-range nuclear missiles.
   ``I tried to listen very seriously to the concerns and the
positions of the American administration,'' the Norwegian leader
said.
   While Norway shares the U.S. view that the Warsaw Pact's edge in
conventional weapons should be trimmed, Mrs. Brundtland made it
clear her government is closer to the West German stand on the
missiles.
   ``I think he knows that,'' she said of Bush, whose hopes for a
successful first summit meeting with the NATO allies, scheduled for
Brusssels May 29-30, are clouded by differences with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Bush wants to more than triple the range of U.S.-built Lance
missiles in West Germany. Kohl, who is up for re-election next year
before a disarmament-inclined electorate, wants the program delayed
and negotiations held between the United States and the Soviet
Union to scale back short-range nuclear rockets.
   ``I think we will see the NATO summit will find common ground by
continuing discussions in the weeks before that meeting,'' Mrs.
Brundtland said.
   If not, the Norwegian leader said, the 16 allied leaders could
accomplish the task in Brussels. ``There is always something left
for political leaders to do,'' she said.
   Mrs. Brundtland said the elements of a compromise should include
a ``linkage'' between non-nuclear and nulcear weapons. ``We have to
be very clear in our requirements to the Soviets on reducing
conventional arms,'' she said.
   The prime minister said the Bush administration felt it had been
taken by surprise by the West German demand for speedy negotiations
over the Lance missiles. ``But these change are a fact and I think
we need to find common ground,'' Mrs. Brundtland said.
   U.S. officials said on Tuesday the Bush administration was
considering a compromise in which the United States would develop a
non-nuclear missile jointly with the West Germans.
   This would require a reversal of a decision by Bonn in February
to stop research and development on the FK90 missile, which was
classified as a tactical weapon with a range below 300 miles.
   A U.S. official said the missile could target Warsaw Pact
airfields and other military installations now targeted by the
Lances.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
development of the non-nuclear missile was under consideration at
NATO headquarters in Brussels and at the Pentagon. ``It would give
us greater flexibility,'' he said.
   Another option under discussion within the alliance is a
declaration at the Brussels summit meeting May 29-30 proposing to
scale back the Lance missiles _ but only after their range is more
than tripled and provided the Soviets reduce their short-range
rockets, as well.
   Mrs. Brundtland said at a news conference Tuesday that ``what we
need now is to look for the common ground, to look for what will be
a sensible and coherent way of addressing the issues both of arms
control and disarmament.''
   The prime minister said her government's position is that ``all
kinds of weapons'' should be on the table in arms control and
disarmament talks.
   Norway has lined up with West Germany in seeking a delay in
extending the range of the Lances to about 250 miles.
   Mrs. Brundtland said Norway also would like to see NATO's agenda
expanded to deal with environmental and energy problems. ``We will
all be hurt by climate and atmosphere changes wherever we live on
the globe,'' she said.

   Sometimes Vice President Dan Quayle's
trip to Australia and Southeast Asia seemed more like Wide World of
Sports than a diplomatic mission.
   Once, he kept Indonesia's minister of tourism waiting for nearly
two hours at the Jakarta airport because he and his wife, Marilyn,
wanted to squeeze in some last-minute tennis at a Port Douglas
resort in northeast Australia.
   Quayle's favorite sport is golf, which stood him in good stead
in golf-crazy Asia. After he played five holes in Singapore, Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew quizzed him on his golf backround.
   Quayle, a well-above-average golfer, said he first handled a
club when he was 10. By the time he was 20, he allowed, he knew
he'd never make pro.
   The Quayles also donned wetsuits and strapped oxygen tanks on
their backs to try scuba diving in the brilliant waters of
Australia's coral-rich Great Barrier Reef. They were so hooked on
the sport, they opted for a second dive.
   In Melbourne, Quayle jogged around the city's botanical gardens,
stopping to chat with the locals.
   And in an Indiana tradition, he started his 12-day trip with a 3
a.m. pickup basketball game at Hickam Air Force base in Honolulu.

   Quayle is vice president now, but the former Indiana senator
hasn't forgotten his Hoosier roots.
   Asked by an Australian reporter where the word ``Hoosier''
originated, Quayle responded: ``That's important. ... Let me answer
that ... I'll give you a little advertising here.''
   Launching into a description of the state - ``five-and-a-half
million people, we don't produce a lot of wheat'' _ Quayle gave one
of the many versions of where the word came from. He said the
Hoosiers were a family who worked on a railroad in Ohio in the
1800s.
   ``Anytime that they really wanted to get the job done, he (the
boss), would always say, `Give me my Hoosier gang,' which meant the
people from Indiana.''
   ``They were hard-working, effective, brilliant people like you
are seeing right here,'' Quayle said as the crowd roared.
   So, interjected the questioner, ``It's got nothing to do with
`Who's you mother?'''
   By coincidence, one of the movies available on the cable channel
where Quayle's staff stayed in Jakarta, Indonesia, was
``Hoosiers,'' spelled ``Hossiers'' on the schedule.

   While Quayle met officials in government buildings, his wife
often went her own way, visiting historic cultural sights.
   ``If you want to go out and see the country, go with Marilyn,''
Quayle told reporters at the start of his 27,000-mile trip. He was
right.
   Mrs. Quayle, traveling abroad with her husband for the first
time since he became vice president, toured a sultan's palace in
Jogjakarta, Indonesia; learned about aboriginal art at Australia's
national gallery in Canberra; gazed at the emerald Buddha inside a
gilded temple at the Grand Palace in Bangkok, and climbed to the
top of the 9th century Buddhist temple at Borobudur in central Java.
   There, she stuck her arm though a stone cage to touch the hand
of a carved Buddha inside.
   ``It's for success in life,'' she proclaimed.

<TEXT>
   Quayle, 42, prides himself on his stamina, but he acknowledged
he felt the effects of his ``if it's Wednesday, it must be
Bangkok'' trip at times.
   On his second day in Australia, the vice president was asked
what surprised him most about the place.
   ``I suppose the most surprising thing, and I've only been here
less that 24 hours, was how tired I was last night,'' he responded.
   Later, Quayle said he'd taken sleeping pills the first couple of
nights of the trip to cope with jet lag.
   Counting four brief stops in cities in U.S. territory before he
reached Australia, Quayle was visiting 13 places in 12 days, flying
27,000 miles.
   His itinerary: Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Pago
Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Port Douglas, Jakarta,
Singapore, Bangkok, Site B refugee camp Alaska, Washington.

   The Quayles seemed to survive their trip without any noticeable
cultural faux pas. Not that there weren't chances.
   For example, the visitors' guide to Thailand, prepared by the
U.S. Embassy and handed out to Quayle's entourage, advised the
following:
   ``Don't stand over a seated Thai when talking to him.''
   ``Don't touch a Thai on the head.''
   ``Don't point or shake your finger at someone. When sitting, do
not allow your toes to point directly at another person.''
   ``Do stand up when the king's anthem is played at the movie or
other public gatherings.''

<HEAD>More Than 3 Million Aliens Apply for Permanent U.S. Residency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after the amnesty application deadline
for illegal aliens, immigration authorities are preparing to
process 3.1 million requests from foreigners asking to become
permanent U.S. residents
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is gearing up for the
second phase of the amnesty program amid charges from advocacy
groups that it is not doing enough to inform aliens of their
obligation to apply for permanent residency if they want to stay in
the United States legally.
   But INS officials say 60 percent of those already eligible to
apply for permanent residency have done so and they expect 97
percent to do so by the end of the program.
   Some advocacy organizations contend that INS should do a better
job of notifying eligible aliens they must apply for permanent
residency or face deportation.
   ``There is a big concern that people will unwittingly lose their
chance for permanent residency because they don't know they have to
take the next step,'' said Arthur C. Helton, an attorney for the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
   But a year after it stopped taking amnesty applications for
temporary residence on May 4, 1988, closing the 12-month
application period, the INS says it is well prepared to process the
papers of the millions of aliens who will eventually become
eligible to apply for permanent residency.
   The INS has received 3.1 million applications for amnesty under
the general legalization and the special agricultural worker
provisions of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.
   So far it has approved nearly 1.8 million applications for
temporary residency, while denying about 70,000.
   Legalized aliens become eligible to apply for permament resident
status 18 months after their temporary residency is approved by the
INS.
   The aliens then have a year to submit their applications and
could become subject to deportation if they do not file the
necessary papers on time.
   At a briefing Wednesday, INS Commissioner Alan Nelson told
reporters that ``applications for permanent residency are on the
rise,'' with about 269,000 returned so far.
   Nelson said the process is being simplified to allow those with
temporary resident permits to submit their applications at any time
rather than waiting 18 months.
   ``This provides additional time in which to file for permanent
residency and removes any possibility of confusion,'' Nelson said.
   INS officials also dispute contentions that its notification
program is insufficient.
   The elaborate $11 million public relations campaign waged two
years ago to announce the amnesty program was necessary because
``we were trying to hit a target behind a smokescreen,'' said
Richard E. Norton, associate INS commissioner for examinations.
   With computerized mailings, however, general advertising appeals
are no longer necessary because ``we are reaching out directly to
these people,'' Norton said.
   Of the people who became eligible to apply last November for
permanent residency, 70 percent have submitted their applications,
he said.
   Overall, the application rate is 60 percent. The INS projects
that 97 percent of eligible aliens will eventually apply to stay in
the United States, Norton said.
   Nelson credited sanctions against employers who hire illegal
aliens with what he called a significant drop in arrests along the
U.S.-Mexican border.
   In the year before the immigration law was enacted, INS and U.S.
Border Patrol agents arrested 1.6 million illegal aliens trying to
cross the southern border.
   The arrest rate is about one-third lower this year than last,
when 940,670 people were stopped at the border.
   The trend ``continues to demonstrate that the law is working,''
Nelson said.
   So far, the INS has issued 4,016 citations to companies alleged
to have hired illegal aliens and has assessed more than $7 million
in fines, he said.

<HEAD>Study Says Alternate Fuels for Cars Could Boost Risk of Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Using fuels such as methanol instead of
gasoline to power cars could boost the risk of global warming,
according to a study given to automotive engineers Wednesday.
   The study said that stringent government controls on emissions
of carbon dioxide and other gases contributing to warming of the
Earth, combined with policies discouraging travel by car, could
lessen the impact of alternate fuels on the climate.
   The study by independent consultant Michael Walsh was presented
at the annual meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers.
   Alternate fuels such as methanol are derived from coal, natural
gas and plants and are used instead of gasoline to fuel cars.
Vehicles able to burn such fuels have been built as prototypes by
major U.S. automakers.
   However, some alternatives to gasoline create high levels of
carbon dioxide when burned. That gas, along with others, can
inhibit the movement of the sun's heat from the atmosphere back
into space.
   Some scientists have predicted that if present trends continue,
the Earth's atmosphere will have warmed on average by several
degrees by the middle of the next century, with possible
devastating effects on agriculture and the environment.
   Alternate fuels ``could increase carbon dioxide emissions
substantially,'' the study said. ``The reason is that coal could be
used as a feedstock to manufacture methanol, and if it were to do
so, overall carbon dioxide emissions would approximately double per
mile driven, assuming that vehicles achieved the same energy
efficiency as with conventional fuels.''
   Moreover, the adoption of methanol commercially would encourage
continued use of fossil fuels and discourage research into
electrical power plants and other alternatives, the study said.
   The study said the increased carbon dioxide output could be
countered by adopting standards to lower emissions by the world's
vehicles by 20 percent in the short term and 50 percent over a
longer term.
   Also, the study said energy prices should be gradually increased
significantly to hold down growth in the number of vehicles and to
``encourage individuals to purchase highly efficient vehicles and
fuels and to make (a) lifestyle decision which will tend to
minimize vehicle travel as well as other energy uses.''

<HEAD>Orange County Asks Disney to Pay $32.5 Million for Roads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange County wants Walt Disney World to
pay $32.65 million to help improve roads heavily used by tourists
traveling to the entertainment empire.
   Disney called the request ``unacceptable'' but agreed to
negotiate with county officials Wednesday under a growth management
agreement with its major host county.
   ``Disney's research says that everyone goes to Disney,'' said
County Commissioner Bill Donegan, adding that it's time for the
company to ``ante up.''
   The five-year road improvement plan proposed by County Attorney
Harry Stewart is the latest effort to get Disney to pay for service
demands the county contends are primarily caused by a construction
boom at the 43-square-mile tourist resort.
   Disney pays no impact fees for roads or services because of a
special state law giving it autonomy from state or county
regulations. Unlike other commercial developers, it does not have
to submit its building plans for state or county review.
   Disney officials contend its huge complex _ which contains Magic
Kingdom, Epcot Center, the new Disney-MGM Studios and numerous
hotels, restaurant and shops _ is self-contained. It builds and
maintains its own roads and operates its own sewage and water
systems and fire and security services.
   Disney said the $22 million it pays in property taxes to the
county each year is sufficient because it needs few, if any, county
services.
   The county attorney said the $32.65 million would represent
three-fourths of the expenses for widening and improving four
sections of two roads leading to the resort.
   The county would pay $11.5 million for construction because some
of the traffic is not heading to Disney, Stewart said.

<HEAD>Pope Says Children Dying as Countries Try to Repay Debts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday lamented
that children are dying in Africa and elsewhere in the Third World
because their governments are forced to spend their scarce cash on
debt repayment.
   In a speech to diplomats, the pope appealed for ``new and
courageous'' action by creditor nations to ease the
multibillion-dollar debt burdens of the world's poorest nations.
   The pope also kept up his attack on apartheid, appealed for
international support for the plan for Namibian independence and
urged solidarity with refugees.
   On the sixth day of his nine-day African pilgrimage, the pope
also flew to the depressed Copperbelt mining region in central
Zambia, and warned youths in Lusaka's sports stadium about
materialism and marijuana smoking.
   On the debt problem, John Paul urged ``mutual understanding and
agreement'' between the debtor and creditor nations. He stressed
that creditor agencies should show sensitivity to the hardships
faced by debtors.
   ``Is it merely a rhetorical question to ask how many infants and
children die every day in Africa because resources are now being
swallowed up in debt repayment?'' he said.
   ``Now is the time for a new and courageous international
solidarity, a solidarity not based on self-interest but inspired
and guided by a true concern for human beings.''
   John Paul said efforts by developed and creditor countries to
relieve debt repayment burdens were ``a step in the right
direction,'' but that ``much more remains to be done.''
   The pope's message is particularly relevant in Africa. The
continent, comprising 28 of the world's poorest nations, recorded
an external debt of $230 billion in 1988. Zambia alone has $5
billion in foreign debts.
   Turning to southern Africa, the pope said the ``world looks with
hope'' to the U.N.-backed plan for independence of Namibia, which
has been under South African control for 74 years. In a related
accord, South African and Cuban troops are to be withdrawn from
Angola.
   While Namibia began a transition period toward independence on
April 1, the plan was jeopardized when black nationalist guerrillas
crossed the border from Angola, leading to new fighting.
   ``To all those who head hear my voice I make an appeal that
Namibia, the latest country in Africa to become independent, be
fully accepted into the family of nations, that it be sustained in
its independence and given every assistance on the road to
economic, social and political autonomy,'' the pope said.
   John Paul, who had denounced apartheid on Tuesday, returned to
the issue, describing South Africa's system of racial separation as
a ``moral problem.''
   ``Discrimination must be overcome not through fresh violence but
through reconciliation,'' he said.
   The pope also lamented the ``tragic situation'' of those who are
forced to flee their homelands because of famine, war or terrorism.
   ``The plight of millions of refugees in different continents is
a festering wound which typifies and reveals the imbalances and
conflicts of the modern world,'' he said.
   The pope praised Zambia and Malawi for caring for refugees from
surrounding countries.
   He also celebrated Mass at an abandoned airport in Kitwe, the
country's second-biggest city. Once a thriving region, the
Copperbelt declined after copper prices dropped in the 1970s.
   John Paul moved through the crowd of 100,000 in his
``popemobile'' as church choirs sang Bemba-dialect hymns. In the
distance, a copper smelting plant billowed black smoke into clear
tropical skies.
   John Paul paid homage to the European missionaries who brought
Christianity to Zambia nearly 100 years ago, and he blessed the
foundation stones of six new churches.
   After returning to the capital, he addressed tens of thousands
of youths at Independence Stadium, named for Zambia's independence
from Britain in 1964.
   ``True progess is not to be measured by a greater number of cars
or radios,'' the pope said, ``but by the way in which the poor and
neglected are treated ... Jesus does not offer you a `quick deal'
or flashy clothes.''
   Referring to the marijuana plants commonly found in Zambia, he
said, ``Dagga smoking is an escape.''
   The pope, who earlier visited Madagascar and the French Indian
Ocean island of Reunion, leaves Thursday for Malawi. He returns to
Rome Saturday.

<HEAD>Study Questions Beliefs About How `Biological Clock' Set</HEAD>

   A study questions the conventional view of how
mammals keep the biological clock in their brains synchronized with
the 24-hour day, researchers say.
   The so-called circadian clock governs a host of body processes,
and disruptions lead to such conditions as jet lag and some cases
of insomnia.
   Scientists generally believe that in most mammals, the brain
maintains the clock's 24-hour rhythm chiefly by monitoring light
and darkness in the environment.
   But the new study found that onset of darkness failed to exert
its usual effect in hamsters if the animals were immobilized. So
the real clock-setting mechanism may be the physical activity that
darkness usually causes in hamsters, researchers suggested.
   The work is presented in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature by Fred Turek of Northwestern University and O. Van Reeth of
the Free University of Brussels in Belgium.
   The paper ``is going to generate considerable controversy over
the next year,'' commented Dale Edgar, director of the
chronobiology and behavioral pharmacology laboratory at the Sleep
Research Center of the Stanford University School of Medicine.
   But he said its relevance to humans was not clear. The
experiment has only been done in hamsters, he stressed. He also
said that in humans, social interaction and the scheduling of
mealtimes strongly influence the setting of the clock.
   He said previous research, including his own, has shown that the
scheduling of physical activity can reset the clock in animals.
Nobody knows whether that strategy can affect the human clock, he
said.
   In the Nature paper, Turek and van Reeth reported that
unrestrained hamsters showed the usual changes in their 24-hour
activity schedules in response to darkness or injections of the
sleeping-pill drug triazolam.
   Either treatment causes a burst of physical activity in
hamsters, and can advance or delay the clock setting, depending on
the time in the 24-hour cycle at which it is given, they said.
   In contrast to its effect in humans, triazolam increases
physical activity in hamsters, as does darkness. Either treatment
can advance or delay the clock setting, depending on the time in
the 24-hour cycle at which it is given, researchers said.
   But when animals were immobilized, the effect of darkness was
eliminated and the impact of triazolam was largely absent, they
reported. Hamsters were immobilized by placing them in a
transparent tube.
   Edgar said it is not clear whether the clock is affected by the
physical activity itself, or the heightened wakefulness that
accompanies the activity.

<TEXT>
   An assassin killed a Palestinian security
man Wednesday, the day after Yasser Arafat's personal
representative was critically wounded in Sidon, which has become
PLO's main power base in Lebanon.
   Police said Bassam Hourani, 30, was shot to death on his
motorcycle near the Sidon vegetable market. Hourani was a second
lieutenant in Fatah, the guerrilla faction led by Arafat, the
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``The assailant, firing an automatic rifle, riddled Hourani with
several bullets in the head and chest,'' said a police spokesman,
who cannot be identified under standing rules. ``Death was
instantaneous. The assailant escaped.''
   Arafat's representative, Issam Salem, 48, was shot down in a
gift shop Tuesday by a man who wore a plastic mask. The assailant
escaped.
   Police said they had no explanation for the attacks on
Palestinians that began with the grenade fired at the home of Zeid
Wehbi on Saturday. Two passers-by were wounded.
   No group claimed responsibility for any of the three attacks,
but Wehbi blamed Israel for the attempt on Salem.
   Dr. Ghassan Hammoud, one of three surgeons who operated on
Salem, said he was making ``remarkable progress'' afer the removal
of the bullet, which pierced the left side of his forehead.
   ``He's in a coma, but not a deep coma,'' Hammoud said. ``The
improvement in his condition was unexpected, considering his
condition when he was brought in. Yesterday, his right side was
completely paralyzed, but today there's only a little paralysis
left on the right arm.''
   Salem's wife, Jihad, said: ``When he hears my voice, Issam opens
his eyes as if in recognition.''
   Her brother, Ali Hassan Salameh, was killed 10 years ago in a
Beirut car bomb explosion blamed on Israeli agents. Salameh, known
as Abul Hassan, led the the PLO security organization Force 17.
   The PLO security department, and the leftist Lebanese Nasserite
militia that governs this ancient port city 25 miles south of
Beirut, said they were conducting a joint search for Salem's
attacker.
   A source in the PLO said privately that several people had been
apprehended, but he would not give details.
   Wehbe said the attack on Salem was intended to ``deal a blow to
Lebanese-Palestinian coexistence in the Sidon region'' and ``such
operations are carried out only by the Israeli Mossad'' secret
service.
   Another PLO official said, on condition of anonymity: ``They're
all being plotted in the same kitchen. It may be Mossad or not.''
   Arafat, on an official visit to France, called the attempt to
kill Salem ``a message for us to put up our hands and stop helping
our Lebanese brothers.''
   Christian-controlled radio stations in Beirut interpreted the
remark as an accusation against Syria, whose soldiers are fighting
Christian units of the Lebanese army. Arafat, a foe of Syrian
President Hafez Assad, has declared support for the Christians.
   Syria has about 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League. Lebanon's sectarian
civil war began in 1975.

<HEAD>Quayle Meets With Thais, Plans Visit to Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle held
get-acquainted meetings Wednesday with Thai officials and will get
a first-hand look at the plight of Cambodian refugees Thursday when
he winds up a 12-day foreign trip.
   Quayle flies to the embattled Thai-Cambodian border, where he
will visit Site B, a sprawling camp inhabited by nearly 60,000
refugees under the control of guerrillas fighting the
Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government in Cambodia.
   The vice president, accompanied by his wife, is on the last leg
of a 12-day tour of Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
   Cambodia's fate has been a dominant theme during the trip.
   Site B is the major camp controlled by forces loyal to Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, the leader of a three-party resistance coalition
currently negotiating with the Phnom Penh government to end a
decade-long guerrilla war which began after Vietnam's invasion of
Cambodia in late 1978.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, Quayle met with Sihanouk, whom the United
States wants to head a transition government after Vietnam
withdraws its troops this fall. Quayle told a news conference
Wednesday that the United States will not consider closer
diplomatic ties with Vietnam until that country ``removes itself
from Cambodia.''
   After his arrival in Thailand, his third Southeast Asian country
in as many days, Quayle explained the basic U.S. position on
Cambodia during a 50-minute meeting with Thai Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan and also stressed the importance the United
States places on protection of copyrights _ perhaps the only major
friction in otherwise strong relations between the two countries.
   Earlier this year, the United States, Thailand's major export
market, denied the country $165 million in duty free exports. The
action was taken after Washington complained the Thais had failed
to honor intellectual property rights.
   Unlicensed reproductions of American video movies, music
cassettes, designer clothes and computer software are made and
openly sold in Thailand. American pharmaceutical products are
similarly manufactured and distributed
   Thai officials say laws exist to protect intellectual property
but enforcement is still difficult. The United States, however, is
considering further and stiffer retaliatory measures.
   Thai government spokesman Suvit Yoadmanee quoted Chatichai as
telling Quayle that good bilateral relations should not be marred
by the United States taking drastic action on the issue. He noted
that the most recent negotiations had proceeded well.
   While Quayle met with the prime minister, half a dozen
university students attempted to hand Quayle an open letter
protesting further American economic retaliation, claiming this
would amount to ``overt intervention of Thailand's internal
affairs.''
   Thai security kept the students from entering Government House,
where Quayle and Chatichai were meeting, and the students
circulated the letter among reporters and others.
   Quayle also met with Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila, and had
an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej and members of his family.
The vice president and his wife, Marilyn, were then hosted at a
dinner banquet.
   Quayle leaves Thailand Thursday for Alaska where he will monitor
clean-up efforts from the March 24 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince
William Sound.

   The fired captain of the tanker that
spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil in Alaska plans to
waive extradition and surrender soon, an Alaskan prosecutor said
today.
   Attorneys for Joseph Hazelwood, 42, assured Alaskan officials
the ex-captain would surrender today or Thursday, said prosecutor
Dean Guaneli of the state attorney general's office.
   His surrender would negate an extradition hearing scheduled for
Friday in Suffolk County, said Suffolk Assistant District Attorney
Philip Castellano Jr.
   Hazelwood, who returned to his home area on Long Island after
the nation's worst oil spill occurred on March 24, was freed by a
Suffolk judge on $25,000 bail. He arrived this morning in Anchorage
and was scheduled to appear in state District Court later today, a
court clerk said.
   An arrest warrant was issued by Alaskan authorities last month
after Hazelwood was charged with three misdemeanors in connection
with the tanker accident. He is accused of operating a ship while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment, and negligent discharge of oil.
   Hazelwood allegedly turned over control of the Exxon Valdez to
an unqualified third mate before the tanker ran into a reef in
Prince William Sound off Alaska.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Tries to Rally Congressional Support for Judges' Pay Raise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in an
extraordinary personal appearance before Congress, tried to rally
support Wednesday for raising federal judges' salaries 30 percent.
   Becoming the first chief justice in some 50 years to testify
before Congress, Rehnquist acknowledged that many Americans think
federal judges already are paid handsomely.
   But he called current judicial salaries inadequate and said they
would cause ``more resignations from the bench, more damage to the
morale of those judges who remain and more difficulty in recruiting
new judges.''
   Rehnquist told the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee
that a 30 percent pay hike is needed immediately, but Chairman
William Ford, D-Mich., indicated the committee is not likely to
take any action until next fall at the earliest.
   Proposed legislation, backed by the Rehnquist-chaired U.S.
Judicial Conference, would provide federal judges with a 30 percent
pay raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments.
   President Bush has proposed a 25 percent increase along with a
ban on speaking fees and a limit on outside earned income.
   A 30 percent increase would boost the chief justice's annual
salary from $115,000 to $149,500. Salaries of Supreme Court
justices would rise from $110,000 to $143,000; appeals court judges
from $95,000 to $123,000; and trial judges from $89,500 to $116,500.
   There are about 700 active federal judges. About 300 others are
on senior status, doing as much or as little work as they wish. All
receive the same raises.
   Responding to committee questions, Rehnquist said, ``I realize
that many people have difficulty understanding why people making
$89,000 need 25 or 30 percent more ... I have wracked my brain
(about) how to get this over to the American people.''
   He added, ``I hope I have not overstated the case ... Judges
aren't constantly saying, `How am I going to pay the rent.' That's
not what's happening.''
   Rehnquist called the proposed pay increase ``a partial recapture
of the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected
judicial salaries over the last 20 years.''
   He added, ``I know there may be a feeling abroad that lawyers
make too much money, but so long as judges are recruited from
lawyers we must take into consideration the fact of how much
lawyers are paid.''
   Rehnquist said current judicial salaries may not attract lawyers
from the nation's larger cities because they can earn much more in
private practice. ``I fear that is what is beginning to happen,''
he said.
   Several committee members were clearly sympathetic.
   Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., said ``federal judges are among
the lowest paid attorneys in America's legal system today'' when
age and experience levels are considered.
   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., said, ``There's no question that the
need is there. I think the judges deserve a raise.''
   But Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., pointedly told Rehnquist,
``This country has a great economic problem.''
   Noting that representatives of the executive and legislative
branches had preceded the chief justice in seeking support for
wide-ranging pay increases, Schroeder said, ``This hearing is the
closing of the greed cycle. I find this tragic.''
   Rehnquist also emphasized the importance of routine
cost-of-living adjustments in judicial salaries, which he said
``could well obviate the need for the sort of sizable `catch-up'
increases'' being proposed.
   Currently, federal judges receive the periodic raises given to
most federal employees by Congress.
   ``Congress' historical reluctance to increase its own pay levels
has often meant that cost-of-living increases for other senior
government officials have also been denied,'' Rehnquist said.
   Federal judges actually have received cost-of-living increases
in most years since 1975. During that period, trial judges'
salaries have risen from $42,000 to $89,500 and appellate court
salaries from $44,600 to $95,000.
   Last week, five Democratic and Republican members of the House
courts subcommittee advised a panel of leading judges that public
protests likely would block any judicial pay raise unless
non-working senior judges were excluded. The judges opposed such
limits.
   The Associated Press earlier this year reported previously
unpublished federal figures showing that in 1987 some 20 percent of
the then-306 senior judges did no judicial work, including former
Chief Justice Warren Burger.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and Rep. Carlos Moorhead,
R-Calif., chairman and ranking minority member on the subcommittee,
subsequently submitted legislation to bar pay raises other than
cost-of-living increases from senior judges who carry less than 25
percent of an active judge's caseload.
   Supreme Court spokeswoman Toni House said it is believed that
the last chief justice who testified before Congress was Charles
Evans Hughes, whose tenure lasted from 1930 to 1941.

   Soon Cho, South Korea's deputy prime minister
and top economic planning officer, said Wednesday that increased
U.S. pressure on his country to open its markets and revalue its
currency could spark even more instability in his violence-plagued
nation.
   ``The most pressing business for the government of Korea is to
restore order and establish the democratic system,'' said Soon, in
Washington for meetings with congressional leaders and top Bush
administration officials.
   Soon spoke with reporters as the most recent wave of student
unrest claimed the lives of six riot police in Pusan, a city about
200 miles southeast of Seoul. The victims were set afire during one
of the many violent protests that have prompted President Roh
Tae-woo to threaten the imposition of emergency measures.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in a
statement that the administration deplored ``the senseless violence
that has led to this tragic and needless loss of life'' and urged
all parties in South Korea to refrain from further violence.
   On trade matters, the administration has charged South Korea
with erecting significant trade barriers to U.S. products, part of
a process that could result in retaliation against nations refusing
to open their doors to American goods.
   The United States has also been pressuring South Korea to allow
its currency to rise in value in relation to the dollar as a way of
making its goods more expensive on American markets and making U.S.
goods cheaper on South Korean markets.
   The South Korean official is slated to meet Thursday with
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. Those topics were sure to be
discussed.
   Pointing out that his nation has been afflicted with near-daily
demonstrations on the part of students, farmers and workers, Soon
said the United States ``is pressing Korea very hard to further
open its markets, appreciate its currency and so on.''
   Arguing that South Korea has already made great strides in
attempting to open its markets, Soon said U.S. retaliation would be
interpreted by the South Korean public as ``too harsh in spite of
the great effort that the Korean government is making.
   ``I'm sure that it would be adding to instability from which
(the) Korean government is already suffering,'' Soon said.
   The radical student and dissident protestors are demanding the
overthrow of Roh's government, but haven't had broad public support
because of their extremism and violent tactics. They have been
able, however, to form alliances with striking workers.
   Soon argued that the South Korean government ``considers the
present level (of the won, the South Korean currency) to be a
fairly appropriate one'' and sees no reason to revalue it at
present.
   He disupted the contention, made in an initial Treasury
Department report last October, that his nation has manipulated its
currency to gain an unfair competitve advantage in world markets,
and he accused the U.S. government of showing ``a lack of
understanding on this matter.''
   He also faulted the United States for making ``one-way demands''
on trade matters, saying ``that is not beneficial to the
maintainance of good relations.''
   Soon stressed, however, that his nation was more than willing to
continue the dialogue to prevent inciting a trade war between the
two countries and to maintain a cooperative relationship.

   NBC News has undergone a ``major restructuring''
aimed at increasing efficiency, NBC News President Michael Gartner
announced Wednesday.
   Miami bureau chief Donald Browne has been named ``executive news
director,'' overseeing all bureaus, correspondents and producers
and coordinating coverage for all NBC News programs. Browne will
report jointly to Gartner and senior vice presidents Joe Angotti in
New York and Timothy Russert in Washington.
   NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said the changes do not affect
anchor Tom Brokaw, who remains managing editor of ``NBC Nightly
News.''
   In a statement, Gartner said the aim of the restructuring was
elimination of duplication of effort that will ``make life easier
for correspondents and producers in the field and producers and
writers on the programs.''
   Gartner also gave ``Today'' show director George Paul additional
duties overseeing the on-air look of NBC News programs.
   Bob Keyes, director of news planning, was named director of news
operations and will serve as Gartner's special assistant.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' has been in third place in the news ratings
for more than a year, and NBC remains the only network with no
prime-time news programming, though the new ``Yesterday, Today and
Tomorrow'' is slated for later this year.

<HEAD>Senators Press Hills to Target Japan for Market-Opening Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators urged the nation's top trade
negotiator on Wednesday to resist pressure to omit Japan from a
target list being developed by the Bush administration in an effort
to open key world markets to American exports.
   ``We would be amazed if Japan, with its whole panoply of trade
barriers, were not on the list,'' Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.,
said at a Senate Finance Committee trade hearing.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills told the senators that the
administration would ``use the negotiating tools contained in the
1988 act vigorously but constructively to open markets, combat
unfair trade practices and persuade our trading partners to honor
agreements.''
   ``In administering these provisions, we will act as a surgeon
using a scalpel to remove these trade barriers and promote a
healthier trading system,'' she said. ``We will not use these tools
to butcher the rules of the system we are trying to strengthen.''
   At issue is a report from Hills, due by the end of the month,
that must target specific countries for market-opening action and
possible retaliation under the so-called Super 301 section of the
1988 trade law. There reportedly is divided opinion within the
administration over whether to include Japan.
   Under the Super 301 provision, the U.S. trade representative
targets key countries for market-opening pressure. If they fail to
lower their barriers to American exports within 15 to 19 months,
the trade representative takes retaliatory steps, such as tariffs
and quotas, to compensate the United States. The president does
have discretion to abort such steps in some cases.
   The provision is called Super 301 because it represents an
extension of section 301 of the Trade Act, which has long been the
basic legal authority under which the president is authorized to
retaliate against foreign countries for alleged unfair trade
practices. Hills is due to unveil her list May 30.
   ``I strongly support the idea and urge you to include Japan in
the Super 301 category,'' Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., told
Hills. He said that ``their market is not open to us in any way
that it should be.''
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., noted that a long-running dispute
between the United States and Japan over semiconductors remains
unresolved.
   ``If that isn't grounds for listing under Super 301 what is?''
Heinz said.
   Under questioning from Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., Hills said
that ``great concern has been expressed by some'' officials of
America's trading partners as the date for the list approaches and
there has been a reaction ``among some others (of) more
belligerence perhaps.''
   ``There is general anxiety,'' she said.
   Asked by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., about reports that foreign
lobbying has been heavy at her office as other countries strive to
stay off the list, Hills merely said, ``We've had a good number of
visitors.''
   She agreed with the view of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., that merely lowering barriers overseas is far from the
answer to the nation's trade problems.
   ``We could open all the markets we have enumerated and it would
not correct our trade deficit, and I think we make a mistake not to
tell the American people that,'' she said. ``To tell the American
people that if you open all these markets that will take care of
the trade deficit _ that is not true.''

   A jogger who was beaten on the head with a pipe
and a rock and raped in Central Park has emerged from her two-week
coma, spoken to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running,
doctors said Wednesday.
   ``I think we have some pretty good news,'' said Robert S. Kurtz,
assistant chief of surgery at Metropolitan Hospital.
   Kurtz and Kent Duffy, chief of neurosurgery, said the
28-year-old woman began responding Tuesday and had spoken in a
whisper to relatives and staff members, raised two fingers when
asked to do so and was able to read large signs printed with yes,
no and her name.
   When a nurse told the patient Tuesday that she would like to
resume jogging, the patient replied, ``Me, too,'' Kurtz said at a
news conference.
   On Tuesday, Kurtz said, the woman's brother ``walked into her
room and said, `Can you say hello?' And she said hello. There's
definite recognition'' of her relatives.
   Members of the woman's family have maintained a vigil at the
hospital since the attack two weeks ago.
   The woman, an investment banker and a native of a Pittsburgh
suburb, was on her regular jog through Central Park the night of
April 19 when a gang of youths pounced on her. Six teen-agers have
been indicted on charges of attempted murder, rape, sodomy and
assault.
   By the time she was found, hours later, she had lost
three-fourths of her blood and her temperature had fallen to 80
degrees, officials said.
   ``She has been emerging gradually over the last couple of days
or three days,'' Kurtz said. ``We would still say ... she is in a
delirium. People in this stage will fluctuate.''
   When hospital staff flashed the signs and she responded, ``three
or four people started clapping. I was one of them,'' Kurtz said.
   Duffy said the patient ``in all medical certainty will not
remember the events of her accident'' and probably will not
remember things that happened to her for a short period of the time
before the attack.
   Kurtz has said it is unlikely she will ever fully recover.
   Kurtz said she lacks facial expression, but ``manages what
appears to be a smile from time to time.''
   Meanwhile, a woman jogging during the day time in Central Park
was assaulted by three youths Wednesday, and told police one of the
youths grabbed her breasts and buttocks, police Detective Vincent
Jones said.

<HEAD>`Tigress' Thatcher Cuddles Grandson, Defends Record of 10 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday
marked the 10th anniversary of her election cuddling her grandson
and likening her combative style to a tigress under attack.
   Interviewed by the domestic Press Association agency, the prime
minister rejected the charge her style is confrontational, saying:
``Most women defend themselves. It is the female of the species.''
   ``It is the tigress and the lioness in you which tends to defend
when attacked. That may give the feeling that one is constantly in
some kind of battle.''
   Britain's longest continuously serving prime minister this
century also dismissed the latest opinion polls, saying: ``If you
just set out to be liked, you would be prepared to compromise on
anything at any time and you would achieve nothing.''
   Opponents looked back glumly to May 3, 1979, when, after a
winter of strikes had left the dead unburied and garbage piled in
the streets, Britons voted out the socialist Labor Party government
of James Callaghan.
   Mrs. Thatcher, leader of the Conservative Party, took office the
next day, May 4, becoming Europe's first woman prime minister. She
since has won two more terms, pursuing a right-wing revolution that
has emasculated labor unions and increased prosperity.
   But critics charge ``Thatcherism'' has made the poor poorer,
encouraged greed and divided the nation.
   ``She has preached the gospel of conflict and division,'' said
Roy Hattersley, deputy leader of the Labor Party. ``(She) has
chosen to govern with an arrogance and autocracy which amounts to
an assault on our democratic rights.''
   In her interview, the 63-year-old Mrs. Thatcher said: ``Everyone
knows now that Britain counts for something in the world at large.
That is the result of many other achievements.''
   Earlier, she posed on the steps of her 10 Downing St. residence
cradling her grandson, Michael. Her son, Mark, and his American
wife, Diane, brought the baby from their home in Dallas.
   ``Isn't he beautiful? Isn't he good?'' Mrs. Thatcher cooed as
she showed off the sleeping baby, dressed in a blue and white
sailor suit.
   Then she ate lunch at the Savoy Hotel, where rank-and-file
Conservative Party legislators presented her with a silver bowl
engraved with the emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
   Also engraved was a tiny penguin, a reminder of the 1982 war
against Argentina in which Britain wrested back the disputed
Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.
   The anniversary has triggered a mass of media analyses of
Thatcherism, opinion polls about the Thatcher decade, souvenirs and
Thatcher books.
   These range from weighty biographies to a paperback jokebook.
Sample: ``Margaret Thatcher boasts that she is a self-made woman.
That certainly relieves the Almighty of a dreadful responsibility.''
   On Thursday, Mrs. Thatcher's 21 Cabinet colleagues, all male and
including only three survivors of her first Cabinet, will host a
dinner in her honor at 10 Downing Street.
   To beat all records for length of service, she would have to
overtake Lord Liverpool's 1812-27 tenure. ``I think you might say,
well within reach,'' a Thatcher aide said sardonically Wednesday.
   Whether they like it or not, many Britons agree.
   A Harris poll in London's liberal Observer newspaper showed 58
percent of those questioned want Mrs. Thatcher to step down within
a couple of years, but only 7 percent believe she actually will.
   A Gallup poll showed 67 percent of respondents dislike Mrs.
Thatcher personally, about the same as the 63 percent who said they
respect her.

   The countdown marched smoothly
Wednesday toward a second attempt to launch the shuttle Atlantis
with a crew of five and a space probe destined for Venus. NASA's
only worry was a worsening weather forecast.
   ``All in all, things look good for a 1:48 p.m. launch tomorrow
(Thursday) and the start of our trip to Venus,'' launch test
director Albert Sofge said of shuttle preparations.
   The weather outlook, however, was not the greatest, with
forecasters saying Wednesday afternoon there was a 40 percent
chance that either rain or high winds would prevent a launch during
the available 64-minute launch period. That was up from 30 percent
in the morning and 20 percent two days ago.
   The first launch attempt last Friday was aborted just 31 seconds
before the planned liftoff because of a short circuit in a fuel
pump. NASA said the delay cost about $300,000.
   The mission to take the Magellan spacecraft into orbit will
revive a U.S. planetary program that has been dormant since the
launch of Pioneer-Venus in 1978.
   ``After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious
to get started,'' said John H. Gerpheide, project manager for
Magellan.
   Shuttle chief Richard Truly opened an afternoon news conference
with, ``Here we are again, and we're ready to fly again. We've
fixed our problems.
   ``The weather is not going to be as good as it was last Friday,
but it appears it will be good.''
   Air Force Capt. Thomas Strange, the shuttle meteorologist, said
``there is a 40 percent chance of a violation of weather
constraints.''
   He said the forecast called for a chance of rain showers. But of
more concern, he said, was the possibility of crosswinds of more
than 14 mph that could be dangerous if the shuttle had to make an
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad.
   On Thursday, the shuttle must be launched by 2:52 p.m., the end
of a 64-minute ``launch window,'' in order to have Magellan in the
right position for a flight to Venus. If it isn't launched by May
28, Magellan will have to wait for two years before Earth and Venus
are in the right position again.
   Technicians working around the clock replaced the fuel pump and
a suspect fuel line in half the time expected, enabling NASA to
reschedule the launch for Thursday, at least a day earlier than
officials thought was possible.
   Engineers had thought there was a leak in the fuel line that was
replaced, but tests turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud
seen spewing from the line, thought at first to be gas, was trapped
water vapor.
   Sofge reported both new parts had been checked and certified for
flight and that the engine compartment had been closed up. The
launch team prepared to pump 528,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen into Atlantis' external fuel tank early Thursday.
   The five astronauts reviewed flight plans and honed their flying
efficiency over central Florida in T-38 jet planes.
   ``This time we're going to see if we can get it right,'' said
David Walker, who will command the mission. ``We're extremely
pleased the folks here at the Cape were able to do such a good and
quick job getting it ready to go again.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   Cleave and Lee are to deploy Magellan from the shuttle's cargo
hold six hours after launch. An hour later a rocket will ignite to
propel it on its 15-month journey to Venus.
   Magellan has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense
sulfuric acid clouds shrouding Venus and map its surface. The
mission costs $550 million, not including the $225 million cost of
the four-day shuttle flight.
   Magellan's radar images should reveal details as small as 100
yards across, about the size of a football field. This is 10 times
sharper than previous pictures of the planet captured by two Soviet
craft in 1983.

   A man was trapped for 20 minutes when his
car was submerged on a flooded street during heavy rain, but he was
rescued by an off-duty police officer who dove in and swam to the
car.
   ``He's the nicest cop I ever met,'' said Willie Cooper, 71, of
Elmont, at a hospital where he was treated for exposure.
   ``It's all part of my job,'' said Nassau County Police Officer
Edward Powell.
   Cooper's car stalled Tuesday in water accumulating under a
parkway overpass during a heavy rain storm.
   ``I knew it was raining like the dickens but I didn't know the
water was that deep,'' Cooper said later Tuesday.
   He said he had stopped his car at the edge of the water but a
motorist behind him pushed him into the center of the rising pool,
where his engine stalled.
   The motorist who pushed him and several other cars turned around
and left.
   Cooper couldn't open his car doors because of the water, which
was up to the top of the steering wheel and rising quickly.
   And with the engine off he couldn't open his electric windows.
   ``I just sat there and waited,'' said Cooper.
   Powell, 28, was on his way home from the overnight shift when he
saw two cars under water.
   Still wearing his uniform, the 6-foot-2 officer jumped into the
approximately six feet of water and swam about 50 feet to the cars.
   There was no one in the first car he checked, but he spotted
Cooper in his car, tugged the driver's door open, grabbed Cooper
and carried him to safety.
   Cooper had spent about 20 minutes in the water.
   ``I'm not going to take any more baths like that one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arafat Says PLO Charter Superseded by November Declarations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat said Wednesday the PLO charter
calling for the destruction of Israel has been superseded by a
declaration urging peaceful coexistence of the Jewish state and a
Palestinian state.
   The PLO chief, ending a two-day visit to France, did not suggest
any formal action to reword or scrap the hard-line language in the
25-year-old charter, and his statement elicited cynical responses
from right-wing Israeli leaders.
   But French President Francois Mitterrand and other government
leaders said Arafat's statements were a step toward clearing up the
contradiction between the charter and more recent PLO statements
recognizing the existence of Israel and renouncing terrorism.
   Arafat told a French radio interviewer he considers the PLO
charter to have been superseded by the Palestinian declaration of
independence passed in November. The declaration urged the peaceful
coexistence of Palestine and Israel.
   Aides to Mitterrand, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
French leaders repeatedly urged Arafat to push for changes in the
charter.
   The PLO chief Tuesday described the PLO charter as ``caduc,''
which in French means outdated or null and void.
   A radio interview Wednesday urged him to clarify the statement,
and Arafat responded that the appropriate word in English would be
``superseded.''
   When asked why he didn't use the word ``abrogated,'' Arafat
responded: ``It is not up to me to say that. It is a decision that
must come from the Palestine National Council.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Arafat's statement, ``If it is backed by words and deeds, is a
step in the right direction.''
   She urged formal action by the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's parliament-in-exile, to abrogate or amend the charter.
   George Habash, head of the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, one of the hard-line PLO factions, said he
was ``horrified'' by Arafat's comments regarding the PLO charter.
   ``We shall show Arafat and the world that the PLO charter
remains very well alive,'' Habash said. ``Arafat has no right to
take such decisions.''
   Ovadia Sofer, Israel's ambassador to France, called Arafat's
statement a ``rhetorical juggling.''
   ``The security of the region and Israel should not depend on the
media stunts of a terrorist like Yasser Arafat,'' Sofer said.
   But French Premier Michel Rocard, who met Wednesday with Arafat,
said his comments constitute ``a positive clarification moving
toward peace.''
   Government spokesman Louis Le Pensec, briefing reporters on
Wednesday's regular Cabinet meeting, said Mitterrand told his
ministers he also ``noted that we are seeing a beginning of this
clarification'' of the discrepancy between the PLO charter and the
November declaration.
   Also Wednesday, Arafat went to Pere Lachaise cemetery in eastern
Paris to pay his respects to Mahmoud El Hamchari, the PLO
representative in Paris who died during a bomb explosion in his
apartment in 1973.
   El Hamchari's widow and daughter stood beside Arafat while he
placed a wreath inscribed ``Glory to the Palestinian martyrs'' on
the grave.

<HEAD>Fed Reports Economy Growing at ``Moderate, Sustainable Pace''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy ``grew at a moderate, sustainable
pace'' in the past three months, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday
in a report which analysts took as a sign that the central bank
will not be pushing interest rates higher.
   The Fed's review of economic conditions around the country
painted a picture of an economy where the growth rate is slowing
with inflationary pressures easing.
   The central bank for the past year has been trying to engineer
just such a development, by pushing interest rates up to dampen
demand and thus relieve pressures on tight labor markets and
factories operating at peak capacity.
   The tone of this report was more optimistic than the last
economic survey released two months ago when the central bank
expressed fears about pressures on wages and prices as a result of
the pace of economic growth.
   The new report, based on surveys conducted by the 12 regional
Federal Reserve banks, said there were no serious bottlenecks in
the manufacturing sector and the costs of raw materials and labor
had shown no significant increases.
   ``The nation's economy grew at a moderate, sustainable pace in
February, March and early April,'' the central bank said in the new
report.
   By using the word ``sustainable,'' analysts said the Fed was
expressing its satisfaction with the current pace of economic
growth and indicating that it did not see the need to push interest
rates higher.
   ``This is a very optimistic review,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm.
``It says that the Fed is happy with the way the economy has
moderated with growth slowing to a sustainable level.''
   The economic survey will be used when Fed policy-makers meet on
May 16 to decide on the course for future monetary strategy. The
Fed's main job is to keep inflation under control through decisions
on how much money to make available to the banking system.
   The Fed has been in a holding pattern in recent months after a
period of aggressively pushing interest rates higher in late
December and January. Analysts said they believe interest rates
will stay where they are currently for the next couple of months as
the Fed assesses the impact of its earlier actions.
   But Wyss said he expected rates to start falling by early summer
as the slowdown in the economy becomes more pronounced.
   While some economists have expressed fears that the Fed has
overdone its tightening efforts and will push the country into a
recession later this year, the economic review saw no evidence of a
dangerous slowdown in any sector of the economy.
   Consumer spending, manufacturing, construction and agriculture
were all reported to be performing adequately.
   The Commerce Department reported last week that the non-farm
economy grew at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first three
months of the year, down slightly from a non-farm growth rate of
3.5 percent in the final three months of 1988.
   Many analysts believe economic growth will slow even further in
coming quarters as the effect of the Fed's year-long credit
tightening works its way through the economy.

<HEAD>Hospital Association: Health Care Threatened by Worker Shortage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shortage of health-care workers, such as
physical and occupational therapists, is threatening the
availability of hospital care, an American Hospital Association
survey said Wednesday.
   In its survey of 3,001 hospitals, the association found that
despite adding overtime, changing compensation programs, setting up
on-call staff pools and using contract services, one-fourth of the
hospitals said they were forced to cut services.
   Of the hospitals that cut services, more than 15 percent closed
beds or units and almost 13 percent sent patients to other
hospitals because they lacked sufficient staff.
   ``Hospital and patients already feel the effects of personnel
shortages,'' said association President Carol McCarthy. ``If left
unchecked, these shortages can threaten our ability to respond to
the health-care needs of all Americans.''
   The survey found that of 20 personnel categories, hospitals were
having the most difficulty recruiting full-time physical
therapists, clinical perfusionists _ operators of machines that
support or temporarily replace circulatory or respiratory functions
_ and occupational therapists.
   Also in short supply were speech pathologists and respiratory
therapists, pharmacists and certified registered-nurse anesthetists.
   Positions for physical and occupational therapists have a 15
percent to 16 percent vacancy rate.
   To address the labor shortages, Ms. McCarthy said she believed
the industry must create, preserve and expand educational
opportunities for people interested in pursuing health-care
careers. Hospitals also must develop innovative staffing options
that lead to greater staff productivity and retention, she said.
   The survey, conducted from July through December 1988, found
that vacancy rates varied according to regions, but physical and
occupational therapists are in short supply throughout the country.

   Immigration authorities credited the Mexican
government Wednesday with helping stem a flood of Central American
refugees illegally trying to cross the U.S. border into Texas.
   James L. Buck, deputy immigration commissioner, said Mexican
authorities have arrested some 13,000 Central Americans trying to
enter Mexico from the south in the past six months, up from 12,000
in the previous year.
   The latest arrests occurred after Mexico tightened security
along its own southern border and began random highway checks of
motorists driving north through the country toward Texas, Buck said.
   Mexico's stepped-up enforcement, combined with tighter border
security imposed in February by U.S. authorities in south Texas,
has significantly reduced the flow of illegal aliens, Buck said.
   An Immigration and Naturalization Service task force set up Feb.
21 to stem a flow of illegal aliens seeking political asylum has
reported a sharp drop in border arrests since then, Buck said.
   The task force arrested 54 people on Tuesday, down from the 200
to 300 daily in February, Buck said.
   The task force now gets only a handful of asylum applications
each day, Buck said. In February it was receiving as many as 200 a
day. Following a court battle, INS won the right to detain people
seeking asylum while their applications were pending.
   Most of the applicants for asylum were rejected because U.S.
officials ruled they could not demonstrate a well-founded fear of
persecution at home. INS officials say most are fleeing poverty and
seeking better opportunities in this country and are therefore not
political refugees.
   As many as 2,500 were detained at the INS facility in Port
Isabel, Texas, where 1,500 people are currently being held. About
1,700 have been deported.
   The complement of 400 Border Patrol, INS, State Department and
immigration personnel who were sent to the Harlingen, Texas, area
is costing the government $4 million to $5 million a month, Buck
said.
   If current trends continue, ``probably by the end of the summer,
we will begin to see this entire task force sized down
significantly,'' Buck said.

<HEAD>Longtime Mississippi Civil Rights Figure Loses Mayoral Re-Election
Bid</HEAD>

   Longtime political and civil rights figure
Charles Evers lost his bid for a fifth term as mayor of Fayette in
the Democratic primary, but Evers says he won't miss being the
center of attention.
   ``I'm happy to be out of the race and out of the limelight,''
the 66-year-old Evers said after losing Tuesday 390-248 to attorney
and longtime foe Kennie Middleton.
   ``It was time for a change,'' added Evers, who says he'll now
concentrate on helping youth in Fayette and Jefferson County,
located in southwest Mississippi and among the most impoverished
areas of the nation's poorest state.
   Middleton, 39, a Fayette native, faces independent candidate
William E. Smith in the June 6 general election.
   The always outspoken and often controversial Evers lost to
Middleton eight years ago and trailed in the balloting against
Middleton four years ago. In 1985, however, he won back the town's
top spot for another four-year term through legal challenges that
eventually were settled by the Mississippi Supreme Court. Evers
first was elected mayor in 1969.
   ``In 1985 he ran a very negative campaign and a campaign of lies
that there were going to be quick solutions to the problems in
Fayette,'' Middleton said.
   Middleton said Evers had done little over the years tobring
about positive change in Fayette, a town of just over 2,000 located
about 25 miles northeast of the historic Mississippi River city of
Natchez.
   Nearly 20 percent of Fayette residents, about 90 percent of whom
are black, were without jobs in March, the last month for which
figures are available. Mississippi had a March unemployment rate of
8.6 percent and the national rate was 5.2 percent.
   ``I think that for all of his visibility and name recognition,
there's one basic element missing,'' Middleton said. ``Those things
do not make him a good administrator, a good mayor. He has
celebrity status, but that does not necessarily equate with the
ability to run a city.''
   Evers says while he was a candidate, he didn't bother to
campaign because he ``could feel the people wanted a change.''
   ``But I didn't want to quit. I wanted the people to select
change.''
   Evers lost a 1978 U.S. Senate bid and ran unsuccessfully for
governor in 1971. He was defeated in a March 14 special election
for the state's central district highway commissioner post.
   Evers is the brother of Medgar Evers, who was field director of
the state National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People when he was gunned down by a sniper in 1963.
   He raised the ire of some civil rights leaders when, on June 22,
1988, he gave a humanitarian award named for his brother to Angolan
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi.
   ``I'm tired. Twenty years is enough,'' Evers said. ``I'm tired
of being out front. Let someone else be out front.''
   As for the future, Evers says he will continue living in Fayette
and will be supportive of the new adminstration.
   ``I will continue to travel, to promote, to have fun and live,''
he said. ``I will keep busy.''

<HEAD>Study Says Potassium May Help Lower Blood Pressure</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For Release at 6 p.m. EDT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New experimental data support the suspicion that
getting enough potassium in the diet may play a key part in keeping
blood pressure under control.
   The research suggests that when people do not get enough
potassium in their diet, their bodies fail to get rid of enough
salt, which makes their blood pressure go up.
   Epidemiological studies that look at large groups of people have
found an association between low potassium intake and high blood
pressure. But experts were uncertain whether the potassium or some
other nutritional deficiency was responsible.
   In the latest study, doctors compared the blood pressures of 10
healthy people on very low-potassium diets and on diets with normal
amounts of the nutrient.
   ``When these people ate diets low in potassium, their blood
pressures went up. One of the main reasons seems to be related to
sodium excretion. When not eating enough potassium, they could not
get rid of enough sodium,'' said Dr. G. Gopal Krishna, who directed
the study at Temple University in Philadelphia.
   Krishna said more research will be needed before making new
recommendations about what people should eat to hold down their
blood pressures.
   ``From this study, I can't draw long-term implications,'' he
said. ``But when you put two and two together with the
epidemiological studies, it suggests that low potassium intake
might be one of the causes of hypertension.''
   The study was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   During 10 days on the low-sodium diets, the volunteers' blood
pressures rose from a mean of 119 over 77 to 126 over 81.
   Most fruits and vegetables are good sources of potassium. Among
some of the best are bananas, starwberries, potatoes and orange and
grapefruit juice.
   Studies have shown that potassium consumption is especially low
among blacks, who are also at greater than usual risk of high blood
pressure.

   Rock star Jon Bon Jovi was married in a
late-night ceremony in front of the Graceland Wedding Chapel,
apparently in an homage to the late king of rock 'n' roll, church
and county officials said.
   John Bongiovi, 27, and Dorothea R. Hurley, 26, both of Rumson,
N.J., obtained a marriage license Friday and were married by the
Rev. George L. Cotton, the Clark County recorder's office said
Tuesday.
   Bongiovi is Bon Jovi's legal name.
   Bon Jovi's longtime manager, Doc McGhee, was unavailable to
confirm his client had been wed. McGhee's secretary, Melissa
Madden, said Wednesday: ``We can't confirm it, we can't deny it.''
   Gordon Wilson, operator of the Graceland Chapel, said a cab
driver came to the establishment Friday night and asked for a tip
to deliver an unidentified couple for a wedding. Wilson refused and
the driver left. The couple remained in the cab, he said.
   A short time later, Wilson received a call from Cotton, who said
the same couple wanted to be married on an archway in front of the
chapel.
   Wilson agreed and the couple returned, with the minister, about
11:45 p.m. Friday.
   ``They insisted on being married at our chapel because of the
name Graceland,'' Wilson said. The chapel is named after the
Memphis, Tenn., home of the late Elvis Presley.
   Las Vegas weddings are popular among the rich, the famous and
the not-so-famous because of the glitter of the city, a tradition
of celebrity weddings here and the fact Nevada law requires no
waiting period.

   Terry Rakolta, the Michigan woman who captured
attention with a letter-writing campaign to advertisers on a
network show she found offensive, on Wednesday announced a campaign
to put more family programs on prime-time television.
   ``Our emphasis ... will be to promote private, voluntary efforts
by the advertisers and the networks to raise the standards on
network television,'' Mrs. Rakolta said of her new organization,
Americans for Responsible Television.
   She said the group's first goal would be the renewal of family
viewing time, which she described as at least two hours of nightly
prime-time entertainment suitable for children and adults.
   ``I haven't met anyone who said they want more sex or violence
on TV,'' Mrs. Rakolta told a news conference. ``The violence today
is so good technically that you're almost a participant in it.''
   She said her fight against programs she views as inappropriate
for children began last year, when her 8-year-old daughter became
upset after watching an afternoon talk show that dealt with women
who had sex with dogs. But the ``straw that broke the camel's
back'' was a segment of Fox Television's ``Married ... With
Children.''
   She lobbied the advertisers with a letter-writing campaign to
complain about sexual innuendo and the treatment of women in the
popular comedy about a blue-collar family.
   The advertisers later pulled their commercials from the show,
with Procter &amp; Gamble Co., McDonald's Corp., Tambrands Inc., and
Kimberly Clark Corp. telling their advertising agencies not to buy
time on the show.
   In March, two advertisers _ Ralston Purina Co. and General Mills
Inc. _ canceled plans to run commercials on NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live'' after complaints from the Rev. Donald Wildmon's American
Family Association of Tupelo, Miss. The Christian group has
campaigned for more than a decade against what Wildmon sees as
pornography and excessive violence in magazines, on television and
in the movies.
   Mrs. Rakolta told reporters that ``First Amendment rights extend
beyond simply turning off the television or turning the channel.
   ``They include the right to voice our objections to the
advertisers about the sex and violence being dumped into our homes
every night.''
   She said she planned to mail letters to 5,000 potential
supporters for her group to ask that they ask advertisers not to
sponsor shows the letter writers consider objectionable.
   ``A boycott (of products) is always a tool; it's a tool of last
resort,'' Mrs. Rakolta said. ``Networks and sponsors can work it
out.''
   Mrs. Rakolta said that, ``when the set is on, children are
usually being exposed to programming that is inappropriate and
potentially harmful.''
   The publicity around Mrs. Rakolta's attacks against the Fox show
netted 832 letters, most in sympathy, to her Bloomfield Hills home.
She said she hoped to use those supporters as the base for her
group.

<TEXT>
   Roger Ailes, the media master of the Bush
presidential campaign, wants it known that he did not _ repeat, not
_ make any commercials featuring Massachusetts convict Willie
Horton.
   ``At no time did any commercial for George Bush contain a
picture of Willie Horton or use his name,'' Ailes said in letters
sent to news organizations, including The Associated Press.
   But wasn't it the Bush campaign that made Horton and the
Massachusetts prison furlough program an indelible part of voters'
perceptions of Democrat Michael Dukakis?
   Indeed it was. And the Horton controversy lives on, most
recently in an article written for The Washington Post Magazine by
Dukakis campaign manager Susan Estrich and entitled, ``Willie
Horton and Me.''
   The Horton commercials were also at the center of successful
efforts by students at predominantly black Howard University to
force former Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater, now Republican
National Committee chairman, to resign from the school's board of
trustees.
   Ailes has been trying to walk away from Horton for some time.
   At first, the Bush campaign was concerned that the Horton ads
would create a political backlash among voters who perceived the
ads as racist.
   Horton, who is black, escaped in 1986 while on his 10th furlough
from a Massachusetts prison, where he was serving life without
parole for a 1974 murder. He surfaced in 1987 in Maryland, where he
assaulted a couple and raped the woman.
   More recently, Ailes is described by associates as tired of
being identified incorrectly as the creator of the Horton
commercials.
   The two commercials that featured Horton were produced and aired
by an independent expenditure committee called Americans for Bush,
not the official Bush campaign committee.
   As Ailes pointed out in his letter, ``federal law prohibits any
collaboration between a political action committee and a legal
campaign committee during the course of a campaign.''
   This is not to say that Bush never raised the Willie Horton
issue.
   Before those ads were aired, Bush recounted the Horton case in
great detail. In his speech accepting the Republican presidential
nomination, Bush said it was ``a scandal to give a weekend furlough
to a hardened first-degree killer who hasn't even served enough
time to be eligible for parole.''
   The Bush campaign did run commercials criticizing the
Massachusetts prison furlough program. But they never mentioned
Horton by name.
   One was the ``Crime Quiz'' ad. The announcer asked, ``Which
candidate for president gave weekend passes to first-degree
murderers who are not even eligible for parole?'' An unflattering
picture of Dukakis moved forward on the screen.
   Another Bush commercial showed shadowy figures moving through a
revolving gate while the announcer said, ``His revolving door
prison policy gave weekend furloughs to first-degree murderers not
eligible for parole. While out, many committed other crimes like
kidnapping and rape, and many are still at large.''
   Jesse Jackson and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, attacked the Horton commercials as racist.
Jackson said using the Horton case ``is designed to create the most
horrible psycho-sexual fears.''
   ``Grossly unfair and untrue,'' retorted Bush when asked about
the allegations his campaign was using racist tactics.
   Estrich wrote that while Bush and his aides may not have paid
for the television ads showing Horton's picture and Dukakis side by
side (Americans for Bush did), ``they took great pride in having
found and framed the issue.''
   Late in the campaign, Ailes was interviewed on the Cable News
Network and said that when he first saw the Horton commercial ``I
called headquarters and said whoever's doing that, get them to stop
it. And the campaign legal counsel said we can't stop it. We have
had conversations, we've sent letters, we can't stop it.''
   Jan Baran, who was general counsel to the Bush campaign, said he
knew of no specific appeal to Americans for Bush to stop running
the Horton commercials.
   Bush aides did complain that the group's name and fund-raising
tactics gave the incorrect impression that it was an official arm
of the campaign.
   On Sept. 8, the day after the two Horton commercials began a run
on national cable networks that was slated to continue until Oct.
5, Elizabeth Fediay, head of Americans for Bush, said she was
sending a letter to campaign chairman James A. Baker III asking him
to express ``your wishes with regard to independent public advocacy
of Mr. Bush for president.''
   She said, ``If he asks me to stop advocating the election of
George Bush, I will.''
   In a letter dated Sept. 27 _ after the Horton commercials had
run for nearly three weeks _ Baker wrote to Ms. Fediay asking that
``you cease using his name, the name `Americans for Bush,' and any
other name that suggests his or this campaign's association with
you.''
   By then, there were few voters left in America who weren't
familiar with the saga of Willie Horton.

<HEAD>Battleship Turret Repair Estimate: $15 Million to $20 Million</HEAD>

   The Navy believes it can repair the damaged
gun turret on the battleship Iowa for around $15 million to $20
million, with the lower figure more likely, defense sources said
Wednesday.
   The sources, speaking one day after Pentagon officials announced
it was technically feasible to repair the turret after last month's
fatal explosion, stressed the dollar estimate was preliminary and
that no decision had been made to authorize the work.
   An assessment team has provided the preliminary estimate but the
investigation is continuing, said one defense official who
commented only on condition of anonymity.
   The Navy declined comment on the issue Wednesday.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said
Tuesday a 35-member team of specialists had determined that
materials and expertise were available to make repairs.
   The answer to that basic question had not been clear in the
immediate aftermath of the April 19 explosion because of the
vessel's age. The Iowa was commissioned in 1943 during World War II
and no vessel of its type has been built since that war.
   Forty-seven sailors died in the explosion inside the No. 2 gun
turret.
   The fact that repairs are technically feasible does not mean the
Navy has decided to go ahead, Howard said. But one defense official
said a final repair estimate of $15 million would make it easier
for the Navy to make that decision.
   Some private naval experts, because of the severity of the
explosion, had predicted last week repairs could cost as much as
$100 million. The Iowa's skipper, Capt. Fred P. Moosally, has said
the vessel would be ready for battle even if the damaged turret was
never repaired.
   The huge battleship still has two other turrets, each with three
16-inch guns.

   As mourners crowded into a tiny rural
church to pay their last respects Wednesday to the minister and
three members of his family found shot to death, investigators
continued their search for clues.
   About 250 mourners filed into the Olive Branch Church of the
United Brethren in Christ for the memorial service for the Rev.
Robert L. Pelley, 38; his wife, Dawn, 32; and daughters, Janel, 8,
and Jolene, 6.
   The Pelleys were shot Saturday in their home across the gravel
parking lot from the church. Their bodies were discovered Sunday
morning by a church trustee.
   The Pelleys' three surviving children also attended the memorial
service.
   In the eulogy, the Rev. Alfred G. Price, a regional
superintendent of the church, read from the Bible's book of Isaiah:
``The righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.''
   ``Though his ministry at Olive Branch was a short one _ two and
a half years to be exact _ it was a very successful one,'' Price
said. ``We, like all who know the Pelley family, are going to miss
them greatly.''
   C. Ray Miller, a bishop of the church, said the family had
served Jesus Christ in a team ministry.
   ``They are now in the actual presence of Jesus. Isn't that
tremendous?'' Miller said.
   The mourners sang ``Amazing Grace,'' which was Mrs. Pelley's
favorite hymn, and ``What A Friend We Have In Jesus,'' then filed
quietly from the church.
   Hours before the service, police divers resumed their search for
a weapon in farm ponds near the parsonage, while a sheriff's horse
patrol searched wooded areas nearby for evidence.
   ``I don't feel we're any closer'' to an arrest, said St. Joseph
County Sheriff Joseph Nagy.
   Investigators ruled out robbery or burglary as motives because
the home showed no sign of forced entry. The absence of a weapon
ruled out murder-suicide.
   A coroner said each victim was shot once in the head at close
range with a shotgun. Police released no further details on the
autopsies.
   The Pelley's three other children were not home when the attack
occurred police said. Jessica, 10, had stayed overnight with
friends, and Jackie, 14, was attending church camp.
   Robert J. ``Jeff'' Pelley, 17, told investigators he spent
Saturday involved with high school prom activities and then
traveled with friends to an amusement park north of Chicago
following an all-night prom party.
   Homicide investigators have questioned Jeff Pelley, but have
refused to say whether he is a suspect.
   The Pelleys married almost four years ago, after their first
spouses died, congregation members said. Jeff and Jackie were
Pelley's children from his first marriage. Jessica, 10, Janel and
Jolene were the children from Ms. Pelley's first marriage.

<TEXT>
   John Turner, who led a dramatic but unsuccessful
fight against the free trade agreement with the United States,
announced Wednesday he is stepping down as leader of the opposition
Liberal Party.
   The Liberals lost twice to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Progressive Conservative Party since Turner took over the
leadership in 1984. The most recent defeat was in November 1988.
   ``It is my intention to resign as leader of the Liberal Party of
Canada at an appropriate time, after the national executive has
chosen a date for a leadership convention,'' Turner said in a
letter released at an Ottawa news conference.
   ``I do feel regret that I was not able to accomplish the
ultimate goal of a politician: To win an election and become prime
minister,'' Turner said.
   Turner, 59, inherited the prime minister's job in 1984 after
Pierre Trudeau resigned, but Turner's term lasted only 79 days. He
and the Liberals were ousted by Brian Mulroney and the
Conservatives in an election that left barely 40 Liberals in the
Commons.
   Much of his era as Liberal leader was marked by fierce internal
battles within the party, which dominated Canadian politics for
much of the 20th century.
   Turner, a lawyer, revived his own and his party's sagging
fortunes with a persistent, emotional campaign against the free
trade agreement that Mulroney signed with former President Reagan
in January 1988.
   The agreement will eliminate trade barriers between the United
States and Canada over a 10-year period.
   ``This is the fight of my life. I've never been more serious
about any cause in my life,'' he said of his effort to halt the
agreement during the fall election campaign.
   The high point of the campaign came during a televised debate
with Mulroney and Ed Broadbent of the third-place New Democratic
Party, in which Turner accused the prime minister of placing
Canada's sovereignty at risk by signing the agreement.
   ``You sold us out,'' Turner said, almost instantly soaring in
the opinion polls and attracting fervent crowds to his once nearly
deserted rallies.
   But Mulroney went on to win a second consecutive majority
government, clinching the way for the pact to take effect Jan. 1.
   Turner gained credit for doubling the party's seats to 83 in the
295-seat House of Commons.
   The New Democrats also are in a leadership race after Broadbent
announced in March his retirement after 14 years at the socialist
party's helm.
   Mulroney, speaking to reporters in Boston during a three-day
visit to the United States, called Turner ``a very worthy
opponent'' who ``gave as good as he got.''
   Turner said he expected to remain a member of Parliament for
``the immediate future.'' He said he had no job lined up in the
private sector.
   A Liberal Party convention is set for October in Calgary, but
the party executive can decide to defer a leadership convention and
turn the gathering into a policy conference.

   Southern Sudanese rebels have kidnapped a
Roman Catholic priest from France and are holding him in the
war-torn south or neighboring Uganda, a French diplomat said
Wednesday.
   French Embassy spokesman Jean-Luc Eyguiser identified the priest
only as the Rev. le Vacher and said he was kidnapped from Torit, a
southern Sudanese town that fell Feb. 26 to rebels of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
   Eyguiser refused to say when it is thought the priest was
abducted.
   In Paris, a spokesman for the White Fathers confirmed that a
Rev. Jean-Marie le Vacher, 62, has been assigned to Torit since May
1987. But the Rev. Louis Nouaille said the order has not heard of
any kidnapping.
   He said he last heard of le Vacher on March 17, when a colleague
returning from Torit told him the priest was in good health.
   ``Had there been any question of a kidnapping at the time, we
would have known,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   Nouaille did not dismiss the possibility le Vacher was kidnapped
later.
   He said the priest, born in the Mediterranean town of Giens,
``insisted on staying on in Torit despite the fighting.''
   Rebels in southern Sudan took up arms against the government in
1983, demanding autonomy and more economic development from the
Khartoum government, which is dominated by the majority Moslems.
Most southerners are a minority of Christians and animists.
   Rebels have kidnapped more than 20 foreign missionaries and
development workers over the years.
   In 1983, Sudanese commandos twice stormed rebel camps to free
foreign hostages, some held under death threats against demands for
money.
   Kidnappings since then appear to be publicity ploys, though
rebels claim they abduct victims for their own protection. Those
held are freed after varying lengths of time.
   This week, rebel leader John Garang announced a one-month
cease-fire to allow the government to work on a peace plan, and to
facilitate a massive U.N. relief effort to save 100,000 southerners
threatened by war-induced famine.

   A grand jury heard testimony Wednesday from
relatives of a man accused of murdering his 16-month-old son,
comatose since last summer, by unhooking his hospital life-support
system.
   The wife, mother and brother of Rudy Linares, 23, of suburban
Cicero, testified behind closed doors before the panel, which can
decide if Linares should be indicted in the death of his son,
Samuel, who was buried Monday.
   Linares held hands with his wife, Tamara, as they and other
relatives entered the Cook County Criminal Court building.
   ``They're in deep grieving over this,'' said Kevin Smith, an
assistant public defender representing Linares.
   ``This has been a nine-month ordeal for them and it's been
exacerbated by the fact that their grieving has been done in
public. Rudy and Tammy can't just go off by themselves and
grieve,'' Smith said.
   The boy suffered brain damage after choking on a balloon or
small piece of aluminum foil last summer, officials have said.
   Authorities said Linares held Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center workers at bay with a gun early on April 26 and
unhooked the ventilator that kept Samuel alive for eight months.
According to police, Linares tearfully held Samuel until he died,
saying later he did it ``because I loved my son.''
   Linares, charged with first-degree murder, was not subpoenaed to
appear before the grand jury. He waited in his attorneys' office
while Mrs. Linares, his brother, Robert, and his mother, Marie
Linares, went to testify, his lawyers said.
   The family members all left the building later Wednesday without
talking to reporters.
   ``We encourage Rudy's wife, mother and brother to fully
cooperate in the sure belief that the grand jury will refuse to
indict,'' Smith said.
   If the grand jury chooses not to return an indictment, the case
would likely go to a Criminal Court judge, whose options would
include dropping the existing charge.
   Tamara Linares, accompanied by her lawyer, Daniel Coyne, was in
the grand jury room for about 25 minutes.
   Coyne said later that she did not invoke a 5th Amendment right
to avoid testifying, but he would not disclose what she said. ``I'm
convinced she's not a target'' of the investigation, he added.
   The couple have two other children, a boy and a girl under age 5.

   The town of Rantoul, Ill., is the first to
receive a federal planning grant from the Pentagon to help cope
with the upcoming round of military base closings, the Defense
Department said Wednesday.
   The community, located next to the Chanute Air Force Base, will
receive $73,045 ``to help organize a base reuse committee to start
planning the civilian conversion of the base property,'' according
to a Pentagon statement.
   In addition to the federal money, Rantoul is contributing money
and services worth $11,300 and the state of Illinois $10,000 to
support the effort.
   ``The reuse committee will oversee development of a balanced
plan for the property covering such uses as aviation, industrial
development, housing, education, recreation and possibly
health-related activities,'' the Pentagon statement said.
   The grant was made by the Pentagon's Office of Economic
Adjustment, which has helped more than 400 communities since 1961
deal with the closure of nearby military facilities.
   The grant to Rantoul, however, is the first since Congress
approved a long list of base closings last month under a special
procedure set up last year. Chanute Air Force Base is one of 86
bases now set for closure under the program, which was prompted
primarily by budget concerns.
   Savings from the plan, which also includes substantial changes
at 54 other facilities, are estimated at $694 million a year at
first. Savings over 20 years are estimated at $5.6 billion.
   The Pentagon has estimated that 15 to 20 communities will apply
for grants similar to that given Rantoul. Besides planning grants,
the Pentagon office also is authorized to help with the
construction or hardware costs of converting bases to other uses.
   The department has asked Congress for $2 million in fiscal 1990
for economic adjustment work.

   College-bound students worn out by the
college application process have let off a little steam by burning
college catalogs and rejection letters.
   ``I'm going to savor this,'' said Mary Pescatello, 18, who was
about to throw her rejection letters from Princeton University and
Dartmouth College into the blaze. ``We've been under a lot of

   Pescatello was joined by about 100 other seniors and parents who
participated in the Tuesday evening bonfire dubbed ``Senior Burn

   ``It's over. Burn. Burn,'' the students yelled.
   One of the parents received the largest roar of approval when
she threw in a textbook on how to take the Scholastic Aptitude

   ``The kids have so much to worry about now,'' said David Hunt, a

   With hundreds of McDonald's Big Macs
stored in its bomb bay, a P-3 Orion submarine hunter will lift off
May 11 on a mission to the Portuguese Azores, perhaps one of the
few places left on earth where there are no Golden Arches.
   The airborne food run was the brainchild of Azores Troop 1 of
the worldwide Direct Service Council of the Boy Scouts, which
decided that peddling a bit of fast food would be a good way to
raise money for a jamboree in West Germany.
   The flight from Brunswick Naval Air Station to the island 3,000
miles into the Atlantic will be a routine Navy logistics flight. It
would take place with or without the 2,000 Big Macs, which have
been ordered in advance from a local McDonald's restaurant.
   The military said the burgers will go into an unpressurized bomb
bay, where they will stay frozen during the flight. The other Big
Mac ingredients will be packed in special containers and stored in
the plane's cabin.
   Once the burgers are on the ground, they will be cooked by 21
scouts, who point out that some of the folks on the island will
probably buy them up fast after going up to three years with no
McDonald's food.

<HEAD>With AM-Missile Dispute</HEAD>

   Senators said Wednesday that if West Germany
pushes for removing short-range nuclear missiles from its soil, the
United States might reconsider its commitment to having many troops
stationed in Europe.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee told Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney they had serious concerns about West German
positions favoring a delay in modernization of the weapons and
urging U.S.-Soviet negotiations to scale back the short-range
rockets.
   The West German stand and the Bush administration's support for
tripling the range of the U.S.-built Lance missiles has created a
major dispute within the 16-member NATO alliance.
   ``I think if the West German people have come to the conclusion
they can place more faith and reliance on (Soviet President Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev's words and assurances than they can upon sound NATO
strategy, then it would be very difficult for me to continue to
commit the size of the forces we have in Europe under those
circumstances,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine.
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said that if the missiles are
eliminated and the 324,000 U.S. forces are put at risk, the
administration's policy should be ``that a substantial percentage
of troops be brought home and we allow West Germany greater
responsibility of their defense.''
   Cheney, on Capitol Hill to discuss the fiscal 1990 defense
budget, cautioned against ``overdramatizing the nature of the
current differences'' within NATO.
   But Cheney speculated that if a consensus called for a zero
level for the short-range missiles, ``I as secretary of defense
would have something of a stomach ache if we found ourself in the
position where in fact large numbers of our NATO allies encouraged
us to maintain our conventional forces in Europe but take out all
our nuclear weapons in Europe.''
   The defense secretary said President Bush has not considered
that possibility but if it did occur, there would be a ``major
dust-up in the alliance.''
   West Germany wants the United States to negotiate with the
Soviet Union on reductions in the short-range missiles. The United
States and Britain have rejected such negotiations.
   Alliance members are hoping to reach some internal consensus
prior to the NATO summit meeting in Brussels May 29-30.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, expressed concerns
that ``NATO appears to be shooting itself in the foot ...
everyday'' by focusing on such a narrow issue, and faulted both
sides in the dispute for failing to show any vision.
   ``I don't see any strategy on the part of the German government
where they're basically saying they won't modernize but they want
to negotiate,'' Nunn told Cheney. ``I don't see much strategy
coming out of the other side's position which says we insist on
modernizing and building a weapon that you will not accept but we
won't negotiate even if the Soviets make tremendous unequal
positions.''
   Nunn said the NATO alliance is letting slip an opportunity to
negotiate reductions in conventional forces. The chairman suggested
a three-track approach linking modernization of the short-range
missile, reductions of the weapons and cuts in conventional
strength.
   Cheney said the debate within the NATO alliance is ``a very
difficult and delicate area,'' although he termed the West German
position ``a weak one because it focuses solely on negotiation.''
   During his appearance before the panel, Cheney also played down
the apparent disparity between his pessimistic assessment of
Gorbachev's chances of implementing reforms and the view held by
Bush.
   ``The president and I were in a meeting yesterday and frankly
chuckled at what has developed by way of press commentary on views
that we have expressed. We do not perceive a significant difference
in terms of our views of the situation with respect to the Soviet
Union,'' Cheney said.
   The defense secretary created a stir last week by speculating
Gorbachev may fail to institute reforms and could be replaced by a
hardliner.
   Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and White House
chief of staff John Sununu offered more hopeful assessments of
Gorbachev's liberalization efforts, although they did not publicly
rebuke Cheney.
   Cheney said Wednesday that he ``responded previously the other
day perhaps with more candor than was warranted about my view ...
somewhat pessimistic concerning Mr. Gorbachev's prospect for
achieving his reforms.''
   ``The president has expressed the hope those reforms will be
successful. We don't see those ... as contradictory statements,''
Cheney said.
   On other matters, Cheney:
   _Said a Pentagon review panel would determine if testing of
``Brilliant Pebbles,'' a more advanced Star Wars system consisting
of thousands of orbiting satellites, would violate the broad
interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. ``I'm
certainly not about to embark on an activity breaching that
treaty,'' Cheney said.
   _Defended his decision to eliminate the V-22 Osprey despite
complaints from Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, that $2 billion and nine
years of work have been invested in the ship-to-shore aircraft.
Cheney said if Congress found some way to put money back in the
budget, he would not object to bringing the program back.

   A former guard at the Nazi
Majdanek concentration camp was sentenced Wednesday to four years
imprisonment for his role in the gas chamber deaths of 60 inmates.
   Karl-Friedrich Hoecker, 77, a former lieutenant in the SS, the
Nazis' special police, served as an aide to the Majdanek camp
commander in 1943 and 1944.
   The court found Hoecker guilty of complicity in the murder of 60
inmates. The court ruled that Hoecker was responsible for ordering
the Zyklon B poison gas used in Majdanek's gas chambers.
   More than 250,000 people, mostly Jews, were killed by the Nazis
at Majdanek, in Poland.
   In 1965, Hoecker was convicted by a Frankfurt court of
complicity in the deaths of at least 3,000 inmates, mostly Jews, at
the Auschwitz death camp during World War II. He served five years
of a seven-year sentence imposed by the Frankfurt court.

   A private human rights group said Wednesday
that conditions for next Sunday's elections in Panama ``fall far
short'' of minimum standards for a fair process, while the U.S.
government continued its campaign of daily attacks as well.
   The State Department accused Panamanian authorities of adopting
an ``increasingly threatening tone'' as the election approaches.
   A report issued by the International Human Rights Law group,
based in Washington, said the Panamanian government has taken a
number of steps to prevent an honest election, including the
forcing of prominent opposition leaders into exile.
   It also said that Panama's Electoral Tribunal is dominated by
pro-government representatives whose response to opposition
complaints has failed ``to inspire confidence in its impartiality.''
   The report said that the Panamanian government has demonstrated
both before and during the election campaign a willingness to
disregard the individual rights of its citizens.
   It noted that other human rights groups have alleged cases of
prolonged detention without charge, of torture and even of murder
of goverment critics.
   ``All of the evidence gathered by the Law Group in its study of
this election points unequivocally to the conclusion that the
conditions for the election fall far short of the minimum standards
required for a free and fair electoral exercise,'' the report said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
Panama Defense Forces and the government news media are undertaking
a ``campaign of intimidation'' aimed at reducing voter turnout and
discouraging popular protest once the victory of the government's
candidate, Carlos Duque, is announced.
   She noted that the government has warned that any media
reporting results other than those released by the government will
be punished by warnings, fines and possibly closure.

<HEAD>Woman Claims Bluegrass Star Hit Her With Bible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GALLATIN, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman says she was trying to end a
romantic relationship with 77-year-old bluegrass music star Bill
Monroe when he beat her with a Bible.
   Wanda Huff, 51, of Birmingham, Ala., said she was trying to get
Monroe to swear on the Bible that he was not seeing other women
when he grabbed the book and hit her with it at this farm near here.
   Huff, who was not seriously hurt in the incident Monday, filed
assault charges the same day against the Grand Ole Opry star. A
preliminary hearing is scheduled May 10.
   Monroe was arrested Tuesday and freed on $500 bond. He did not
return a telephone message left Wednesday by The Associated Press
at his Nashville office.
   Huff, who said she is the divorced mother of two, described
herself as Monroe's girlfriend for 3{ years.
   ``I was leaving him, and I wanted my things back,'' she said in
a copyright story Wednesday in the Nashville Banner.
   ``That's when he just started tearing things up,'' she said. ``I
told him to stop, and I asked him if we couldn't just end this
thing on a very peaceful note.''
   ``Things kept on, and finally I said, `Bill, if you haven't been
running around with these women, here's the Bible ...'
   ``I said, `Swear on it to me that you have not been running
around, because that way you'll tell me for real.'
   ``He said, `I'm not going to do it.' That's when he took the
Bible and _ swack _ right in the mouth. It was a big ol' Bible.''
   Huff, a dog trainer, said she pushed him away.
   ``Bill takes nitroglycerin for his heart, and all I need is for
the old man to drop dead on me and I'd be in trouble.''
   She said he also slapped her head, broke her glasses, and kicked
her.
   Huff said Monroe's farm manager, Archie Mills, came in the house
and helped her escape.
   Tony Conway of Buddy Lee Attractions, a Nashville booking agency
for Monroe, quoted the performer as saying Huff came to his house,
started destroying property and caused a major disturbance.
   ``He asked her to leave several times and she refused to
leave,'' Conway said. ``Mr. Monroe called the police, the police
came to the house, took statements from both parties, and I guess
she filed charges against him.
   ``He did state that he's totally shocked and that he's never
been arrested for anything in his life.''
   Conway said he did not ask the performer whether he struck the
woman.
   Monroe, a singer and mandolin player, has played with his band,
the Bluegrass Boys, on the Opry since 1939. ``Blue Moon of
Kentucky'' is Monroe's best-known song. In February, he won the
first Grammy award presented for bluegrass music.

<HEAD>Ethics Panels Begin Interviews in Profitable Well Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee Wednesday began
interviewing a group of Texans involved in a gas-drilling venture
that has so far produced little gas, but resulted in large profits
to House Speaker Jim Wright.
   The panel began two days of scheduled interviews by going behind
closed doors to question San Antonio businessman Morris Jaffe.
Jaffe and his son, Doug, who are friends of Wright, allowed the
speaker and his business partner George Mallick to buy into the
well venture last year.
   At the same time, a special House ethics task force created this
year to examine House rules and ethics guidelines opened public
hearings on such areas as financial disclosure, outside income,
receipt of gifts and use of official resources.
   Task force chairman Vic Fazio, D-Calif., also a member of the
ethics committee, said the panel hoped to learn from lawmakers'
ethics problems to draft clarifications in the rules and achieve
better education of House members and staff.
   While Fazio sought to isolate the hearing from the current
atmosphere of the Wright case, former Rep. Otis Pike, D-N.Y., hit
it head on.
   ``Your preoccupation with each other's ethics is preventing you
from doing your jobs,'' Pike testified. ``It is taking too much of
your time, and worse, it is creating an atmosphere and an
institution in which suspicion, bitterness, personal dislikes and
private vendettas make cooperative efforts in writing laws
increasingly difficult. And that is serious.''
   He added: ``No one learns his ethics in Congress. No one needs
to be told by his colleagues what is right and fair and
honorable... Ethics is not as great a problem with Congress as is
courage.''
   Ethics Committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said the
session with Jaffe had been productive, but would not comment on
the businessman's testimony. Jaffe's lawyer, Stanley Brand, said
the questions generally covered the same ground as a 23-page report
on the gas deal which he issued earlier in the week.
   That report justified the transaction as a legitimate business
venture and noted that the remaining partners in the deal plan to
drill another well, believing substantial gas deposits remain to be
tapped. It was not, the report contended, a gift to Wright designed
to gain favor and influence over legislation.
   The Jaffes have been competing to sell the Air Force a new
trainer aircraft produced by one of their companies.
   The Wright-Mallick partnership's $9,120 investment last year
grew into a $340,000 profit over a period of five months, even
though the well had been unable to produce commercial quantities of
gas.
   When it announced last week it was charging Wright with 69 House
rules violations, the ethics committee said it was continuing to
investigate the gas venture, known as the Sabine Lake project after
its location near the Louisiana-Texas line.
   Also to be interviewed by the committee were Doug Jaffe; Doug
Prestridge, a geologist; Dave Myers, who provided the drilling
equipment for the Sabine Lake well; and Marlyn Cherry, the Jaffes'
bookkeeper.
   The continuing investigation has stalled committee progress
toward holding a disciplinary hearing for Wright, the trial-like
phase of the ethics process in which evidence is presented and
Wright will have a chance to make a personal appeal.
   Wright seemed to complain about the slowness on Tuesday, calling
the investigation ``a moving target'' which was frustrating his
efforts to mount a defense.
   But Dixon dismissed that charge, saying the committee is abiding
strictly by its rules. ``He will, in an appropriate time, have a
chance to respond to all the charges,'' Dixon said.

   President Bush took a call in the Oval Office
on Wednesday from a student at the Arizona School for the Deaf and
Blind, inaugurating a service that allows speech- and
hearing-impaired people to talk to government officials and
agencies.
   By using a toll-free access number, Suzanne Smith, 17, who is
deaf, contacted a General Services Administration relay station,
using a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf, from her school in
Tucson.
   She typed a message to the center asking to reach the president,
and Bush, in the presence of photographers and reporters, took her
call.
   After some initial telephone interference that caused the
president to ask her to repeat herself, the call went ahead without
problems.
   ``Did you ever think about going to college, and, if so,
where?'' Bush asked Suzanne.
   ``I want to go to college,'' she replied. ``I would like to go
to Gallaudet University,'' a college for the deaf in Washington,
D.C.
   The young woman then asked Bush how the six puppies were doing.
   ``They're just fine,'' he said. ``The first one leaves tomorrow.
I'm not going to be too sorry to see them go. They're getting
pretty aggressive. We'll be glad to get back to one dog, if you
know what I mean.''
   First lady Barbara Bush will deliver one of the puppies of
Millie, the Springer spaniel, to her son, George W. Bush, when she
travels Thursday to Dallas.

   GTE Florida Inc. is sending workers
door-to-door in portions of two counties this week to collect
telephone books that mistakenly included the address of a spouse
abuse shelter.
   The company said about 30,000 books were recalled in Pasco and
Pinellas counties. Another 60,000 directories were printed with the
error but never distributed, said GTE public affairs manager Bruce
Kotchey.
   Distribution began last Thursday. GTE ordered the recall Friday
after learning the address, which the shelter requested not be
listed, was included.
   GTE feared angry husbands would be able to find the center and
attack women who went there for help, Kotchey said. The spokesman
blamed the mistake on ``human error somewhere along the line.''
   The phone company hopes to begin distribution in two weeks of
corrected directories.
   GTE representatives and directors of the shelter are discussing
ways, including additional shelter security, to blunt the effects
of the listing, Kotchey said.

   Witnesses urged Congress on Wednesday to lift
restrictions that allow the government to keep foreigners out of
the United States because of their ideological beliefs.
   Under the McCarran-Walter immigration law, foreigners may be
kept out for ideological reasons. Other laws allow the federal
government to restrict foreign travel by Americans through limits
on the way the dollar can be spent.
   Novelist Larry McMurtry told the House Judiciary Committee's

``abridges the rights of Americans to engage in face-to-face
discussions and debate with foreign colleagues.''
   Choichiro Yatani, a Japanese who teaches psychology in the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said he was jailed for 44
days and threatened with deportation over suspicions he was a
communist. He said his status in the country ``remains tenuous and
my name remains on the immigration `lookout list.' ''
   A bill by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., would allow foreigners to
visit the United States regardless of their ideas or what they
might say here.
   The Justice Department has told Frank in a letter that it wants
to keep the authority to prevent the entry of foreigners it
considers undesirable.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., has introduced a bill to end the
currency restrictions that have been used to limit travel by
Americans. He noted that as Americans do not spend their own money,
they are free to travel to Cuba.
   ``This means that Americans can and do travel to Cuba as guests
of a Cuban government eager to present a positive image of life in
Cuba. I find it highly compromising for Americans to be able to
travel to Cuba only on Castro's tab,'' Berman said.
   Loren F. Ghiglione, president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, criticized Vice President Dan Quayle and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the administration's
refusal to admit Cuba's Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega
to address the society's meeting last month.
   Quayle had suggested that Ortega could have been interviewed in
Nicaragua.
   ``If I as the editor of a 7,000 circulation newspaper may be
permitted a somewhat personal response to the vice president's
suggestion, I would remind the committee that the U.S. press is
unlike that of any other nations,'' Ghiglione said in prepared
testimony.
   `It is essentially local-provincial, not national. Half the
country's dailies have a circulation of 20,000 or less. While I and
other small-town editors have made reporting trips to Nicaragua,
the Middle East, southern Africa and other newsworthy parts of the
world, we do not have the resources or clout to travel to Nicaragua
and interview Mr. Ortega on a regular basis.''
   Ghiglione said Americans are hindered in criticizing censorship
elsewhere by what he called ``oppressive and restrictive censorial
authority ... within the United States.''
   Baker, in defending the decision to keep Castro and Ortega from
speaking to the ASNE meeting, said he did not believe the decision
amounted to censorship. He said the government was exercising ``a
certain amount of discretion'' in not issuing visas for the two
Marxist leaders.

   The Courage Foundation, honoring four people
who served the public good, issued awards Tuesday to men who fought
against crime and inflation, a woman who demanded progress in the
classroom and a man who promoted public health.
   ``The idea is to recognize courage in our senior appointed and
elected officials,'' John Dyson, chairman of the New York-based
foundation said at a ceremony before granting crystal lions and a
$5,000 check to the recipients: U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Paul Volcker,
former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, and teacher Gloria Pipkin.
   The Courage Foundation describes itself as a non-partisan,
non-political organization that draws its support from people of
all political persuasions.
   Kopp's award was for ``promoting the welfare of society in
general, not one group over another; and for his vigorous efforts
to educate the public about AIDS and cigarette smoking in the face
of harsh criticism.''
   Koop told the audience of about 30 he was ``a little
embarrassed.''
   Volcker's citation, according to a prepared statement, was for
``tightening the money supply during the early 1980s when it was
considered an unorthodox approach for combating the country's high
inflation rate.''
   Giuliani, who resigned as the former U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York to run for New York City mayor, was
selected ``for his prosecution of organized crime kingpins, as well
as efforts to weed out corruption in the financial community.''
   He said described himself as ``very humbled'' and said he would
donate his $5,000 award check to a drug rehabilitation program.
   Ms. Pipkin, a Panama City, Fla., school teacher, was honored
``for spearheading a battle against school officials who banned the
classroom use of such books as `The Red Badge of Courage,'
`Hamlet,' and `Fahrenheit 451' because they contained material some
officials considered inappropriate.''
   Ms. Pipkin said in an interview that her suit against the school
board is still pending. She said her reading list was opposed by
Christian fundamentalists in the area and ``it got caught up in
missionary zeal.''

   President Bush on Wednesday paid tribute to a
Chilean woman instrumental in voter registration efforts there and
a leader of the Polish Solidarity trade union movement.
   Standing between the pair in the Roosevelt Room of the White
House, Bush noted that the Chilean, Monica Jimenez de Barros, and
Polish Solidarity figure Jacek Kuron had won the Democracy Award
from the National Endowment for Democracy, a private U.S.
foundation.
   ``Monica Jimenez de Barros founded and directed the Crusade for
Citizen Participation in Chile,'' the president said. ``She
educated and mobilized millions of voters in Chile's plebiscite
election last October.''
   ``Due in part to her efforts,'' he said, ``Chile is on a road
toward democracy. We do not deceive ourselves that this is an easy
road. But we believe Chile is on an irreversible course. And
Chileans who seek democracy deserve the support of everybody in the
United States, everybody that loves democracy around the world.''
   He said that Kuron ``has been a key leader in Solidarity's
struggle in Poland.''
   Bush talked of the trade union movement's recent ``important
victory'' in Poland, saying that as the Eastern European nation
``moves towards more freedoms for all of its people, greater
economic opportunity and strength, the world will be watching and
applauding.''
   ``We salute you and the kind of personal courage that you both
have shown in the face of great obstacles,'' the president said.
``You've shown that tenacity and faith and courage in the name of
democracy can make a difference for millions of people.''

And I told her, and she said, `We can't afford to give up all the
blessings.'''
   Bennett got hearty applause from the audience when Rabbi Joseph
P. Weinberg of the congregation gave Bennett a stuffed white bear
with blue features, adorned with several blue balloons.
   The Bennetts have another son, 5-year-old John.
   Asked the name of the new baby, Bennett told reporters, ``His

<TEXT>
   Israel's army on Wednesday unveiled a
new tank that the inventor says will ``remain forever young''
because of a unique armor system that can be replaced, even on the
battlefield.
   Army commanders said the thick-skinned Merkava Mark 3 can
survive anything an enemy infantryman can throw at it, making the
tank one of the toughest in the world. Merkava means ``chariot'' in
Hebrew.
   ``This is the most protected tank against known anti-tank
weaponry,'' Brig. Gen. Yossi Ben Hanan, head of the armored corps,
told reporters during a visit to the production line at a military
base near Tel Aviv.
   ``The Mark 3 is a step ahead of any tank deployed in the Middle
East now,'' he said, adding it was on a par with the new Soviet
T-80 and the U.S. M-1A1.
   Israel Tal, a retired major generalwho developed the tank and is
now a Defense Ministry adviser, said the revolutionary change in
the tank was the construction of modular units and bolt-on armor
that can be removed to make way for improvements.
   This means the tank can get periodic facelifts to keep its skin
as tough as possible. This is especially important at a time when
armor technology is rapidly changing, he said.
   ``This tank will remain forever young. It will never be old. The
armor can be changed at any time, even in the field,'' said Tal,
who led the armored column that seized the Suez Canal from Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   In addition to the replaceable armor, some parts of the vehicle
such as the fireproof fuel tanks in the rear are modular units that
can be changed if upgraded parts are developed.
   The army screened a film of the low-slung tank tearing across
the rocky terrain of northern Israel, making about a 40-foot leap
through the air from an earthen embankment while going full tilt.
   The Mark 3's top speed was not disclosed but it has a U.S.-made
1200 horsepower engine. It also has a larger gun, 120mm instead of
the 105mm cannon on earlier models.
   In chemical, nuclear or biological warfare, the tank can be
sealed shut and the crew can operate in an air-conditioned
environment without gas masks or cumbersome suits, Tal said. The
atmosphere in the cabin is ``over-pressured'' so that air leaks out
rather than poison seeping inside, he said.
   Other unique features of the Merkava include a back door that
allows the tank to unload an infantry squad during a battle and a
front-mounted engine which doubles as additional armor to protect
the crew.
   The new tank costs $2.3 million per unit to develop compared to
$1.8 million for the Mark 1, first introduced in 1979 and
battle-tested against Syria's Soviet-made T-62 tanks in the 1982
Lebanon War.
   Tal said the advent of the Mark 3 means Israel now is in a
position to sell its Mark 1 and 2 tanks to foreign countries. He
also said special features of the tank, such as the bolt-on armor,
could be sold separately to uprgrade existing tanks and other
armored vehicles.
   Despite some contentions that tanks are no longer the dominant
force in land battles, Tal contends they will remain a key element
of warfare.
   ``Tanks are considered by both East and West as the backbone of
warfare on land. This didn't change yet and the assumption is that
it won't change until the end of the century,'' he said.

<HEAD>Treasury Department Announces New Borrowing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department announced Wednesday
that it plans to borrow $28.75 billion next week to replenish the
government's coffers in one of four giant debt auctions it holds
during the year.
   Treasury officials said the auctions would include the sale of
three-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds to refinance $17.3
billion in maturing government debt and raise $11.5 billion in new
cash.
   The total debt being sold was in line with market expectations
and was very similar to the last debt sale held in February.
   At a briefing for reporters, William Bremner, Treasury deputy
assistant secretary for finance, said that the department expected
the government's debt, which currently stands at $2.76 trillion,
would hit the congressional limit of $2.8 billion sometime this
summer.
   ``We will hit the debt ceiling some time this summer and when it
occurs, it is our hope that Congress will raise the debt ceiling in
a timely fashion,'' Bremner said.
   In the past, extended debate over raising the limit on how much
the government can borrow has often become embroiled in questions
about spending and taxes and has thrown government operations into
a turmoil with threatened shutdowns because of a lack of cash.
   However, administration officials said they hope the recent
budget accord reached with Congress will avoid that situation this
year.
   According to Wednesday's announcement, the auctions for next
week will include:
   _ $9.75 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned on Tuesday.
   _ $9.5 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Wednesday.
   _ $9.5 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned on Thursday.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Chairman Blasts EPA For Not Protecting Consumers from
Pesticides</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a House subcommittee
criticized the Environmental Protection Agency Wednesday for not
doing more to stop pesticides banned in this country from showing
up in imported food.
   The government must ensure that foreign buyers of U.S.-made
pesticides understand their dangers and protect the American public
from imported food contaminated with unsafe pesticides, said Rep.
Mike Synar, D-Okla.
   ``The EPA has failed miserably,'' said Synar, chairman of the
House Government Operations Committee's subcommittee on
environment, energy and natural resources, which has jurisdiction
over the agency.
   During a hearing of his subcommittee, Synar said Agriculture
Department inspectors found chlordane, a chemical believed to cause
cancer, in two shipments of Honduran beef.
   ``Our reports show that chlordane is made only in the United
States,'' but is not allowed to be sold here as pesticide, said
Synar.
   In both cases, most of the Honduran beef had been sold to
grocery stores, ground up and purchased by consumers before the
chlordane contamination was discovered.
   Synar criticized the EPA for not warning the Agriculture
Department that Honduras was buying an American-made pesticide that
could contaminate beef sold to the United States.
   It's time for Congress ``to revisit our pesticide export
policies,'' he said.
   During the hearing, EPA officials admitted they can't ensure
that pesticides outlawed here won't show up in imported food. But
they also charged that the subcommittee hasn't followed its own
suggestions for helping other countries better understand the
dangers of some pesticides made in the U.S.
   Linda Fisher, EPA assistant administrator for policy, planning
and evaluation, said the agency was aware more needed to be done.
   When presented with an internal memo dated April 17, 1987, that
outlined improvements needed to better educate foreign buyers and
protect American consumers, she conceded that none had been
followed.
   But Fisher assured Synar the EPA would quickly act on the
recommendations, as well as those of international negotiators
working to establish a policy for worldwide pesticide use.
   Synar's charges against the EPA were supported by a report from
the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress.
   The GAO said EPA has no established procedures for deciding when
to notify foreign countries about pesticides the United States has
designated dangerous to human health.
   The EPA also has no standards for determining whether action
taken against pesticides in this country are significant enough to
warn another nation, according to the GAO report.
   Under U.S. law, pesticides that are banned or unregistered
domestically can be sold abroad if the foreign buyer provides a
statement saying he understands that the product is outlawed in the
United States. A copy of that statement is provided to the foreign
government through the State Department.
   The EPA does not routinely send out notices to foreign
governments when companies voluntarily cancel domestic
registrations, the GAO said.
   ``The agency is considering improvements to its present
procedures, including those reocmmended by GAO,'' said Fisher.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl had his first
meeting late Wednesday with the new, tough-talking U.S. ambassador
after the Netherlands and Canada pushed for compromise in a NATO
dispute over defense strategy.
   Ambassador Vernon A. Walters repeatedly has stated his support
for a NATO project that would more than triple the range of nuclear
missiles based in West Germany, and his opposition to arms talks
with the Kremlin aimed at reducing short-range missile stockpiles.
   But embassy spokesman Bill Bach said Walters, who started his
job last week, would make no public comment on his talks with West
German leaders in alliance efforts to resolve the issue.
   Government spokesman Reinhardt Schwarzer said Kohl's office also
would not comment officially.
   In Washington, President Bush on Thursday ruled out negotiations
with Moscow on short-range nuclear missiles and the White House
portrayed Bush's disagreement with Kohl as a sign of NATO's
vitality.
   Kohl stirred the long-simmering dispute over short-range nuclear
forces _ which arms negotiators call SNF _ into a full-fledged
controversy last week when he called for negotiations aimed at
``the third zero,'' or ultimate elimination of short-range missiles.
   Talks are already in progress to cut the superpower arsenals of
long-range missiles, and the December 1987 agreement on
intermediate-range forces set out the total removal of those
weapons to reach the first zero.
   The Pentagon opposes negotiations on short-range missiles,
claiming the Warsaw Pact has a predominance in conventional arms
and that until a balance is achieved the Western alliance needs to
retain a nuclear option.
   But West German fears of becoming a nuclear battleground
intensified in recent months because most of the short-range
missiles _ the only nuclear weapons not under negotiation _ are
based in West Germany.
   Of NATO's 88 Lance missile launchers deployed in Central Europe,
76 are in West Germany. The rockets have a range of about 75 miles,
so their use would mean fighting a nuclear war on West German
territory.
   The SNF flareup triggered a flurry of diplomatic efforts to work
out a compromise that would satisfy all 16 member nations of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   U.S. officials here and in Washington and Brussels say they
presented ideas to resolve the impasse, but no visible signs
emerged that the dispute would soon be put to rest.
   Canada said Wednesday it had communicated a compromise plan to
Bonn, Washington and London, but External Affairs spokesman
Christian Sarrazin said no details would be disclosed.
   A senior Bonn official told The Associated Press the Canadian
proposal was ``under review'' by the Foreign Ministry but said he
could not comment further.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein was asked at a news conference
if Kohl would insist on opening short-range talks before West
Germany's next federal elections in December 1990, or if timing of
the forum was a possible area of compromise.
   ``A lot of things are possible,'' Klein replied vaguely.
   A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters in Bonn on
condition of anonymity, expressed confidence the SNF debate would
be ironed out by the end of the month when leaders of NATO nations
meet in Brussels for their annual summit.
   Dutch Premier Ruud Lubbers talked with Kohl earlier Wednesday on
ways of breaking the impasse, but officials refused to discuss
details.
   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher met with
French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Kohl went to Rome as part
of an apparent campaign to gain support for Bonn's position.
   Bonn says Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Spain
support it on short-range talks and resistance to NATO's replacing
the Lance systems with new missiles capable of reaching targets 300
miles away.
   But Italian Premier Ciriaco De Mita said his country favors
linking the SNF forum to progress toward a balance of conventional
arms between East and West, a condition also stipulated by the
United States and Britain.

<BYLINE>Bennett: Drug Punishment Certainty More Crucial than Severity ^By
CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stiff prison sentences are fine, the
administration's top drug-control official said Wednesday, but in
drug cases ``certainty of punishment is more important than
severity.''
   William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy, told several hundred members of the Washington
Metropolitan Area Interreligious Coalition that his approach to the
drug problem can be summed up in the words, ``consequences and
confrontation.''
   ``Those who use, sell and traffic in drugs must be confronted,
and they must suffer consequences,'' Bennett said. He is working on
a strategy for drug control nationwide, with a report due in early
September.
   While saying there is broad agreement on such consequences as
``seizure of assets, stiffer prison sentences, revocation of bail
rights and the death penalty for drug kingpins,'' he added, ``I
also find that we lack the resources to assure that consequences
always follow crime.''
   He called for more prisons and jails and for more investigators,
prosecutors and judges, but also said, ``More and tougher action
will not be enough.
   ``I think we need to reorient our process of justice where drugs
are concerned, and adopt the principle that certainty of punishment
is more important than severity of punishment,'' Bennett said.
``Those guilty of drug offenses must believe that punishment is
inevitable. As long as they don't, the deterrent effect of
incarceration is neutralized.''
   After the speech, Bennett said he wasn't suggesting reduced
sentences for drug offenders, including what he termed casual users.
   ``I am for severe penalties, particularly when a drug crime is
severe, but what you have to have is certain punishment,'' he said.
``You shouldn't make certain punishment hostage to severe
punishment.
   ``What that means is a person that commits a drug crime has to
know they're going to be punished. And if you have to sacrifice an
extra six months of punishment in order to be sure the person gets
some punishment, make sure they get some punishment,'' Bennett
said. ``It would be better in many situations to have everyone
that's convicted of drug use to go to jail for a week ... than to
just get a third of them going for six months.''
   As an example, he cited a practice in Phoenix, where he said
police arrested drug users, many of them middle-class, and ``put
them in jail for a weekend, that's all, just a weekend. For a lot
of middle-class users, that is plenty of time. ... They are cured
after one weekend in the slammer.''
   Bennett acknowledged that such an idea would be for state and
local governments to carry out and that he, as director of national
drug control policy, would not be imposing such regulations on the
federal level.
   But he said local officials have asked him repeatedly during his
two months on the job to let them know if there are any good ideas
floating around, and the Phoenix example is one he's advocating.
   Another local example he touted was that of Toledo, Ohio, where
``parents are brought before the juvenile justice court and made to
answer for the actions of their children through civil penalties.''
   ``This policy establishes the principle that parents ... must
bear responsibility for the behavior and the activities of minors
in their charge,'' Bennett said. ``Minors who are non-addicted
users must be taught early on that they cannot behave with
impunity, and parents who have effectively turned them loose must
learn why the social contract demands that they oversee and control
the impulses of their children.''
   Asked later if that included jailing parents for their
children's transgressions, Bennett said that should occur only in
``extreme cases.''
   As for treatment and rehabilitation of drug offenders, Bennett
told the coalition that ``in many cases, rehabilitation is the
wrong term to use.''
   ``In the case of 15-year-old offenders who have grown up
essentially without parents, some therapists I have talked to have
found it necessary to serve as substitute parents, complete with a
tuck-in and bedtime story at night,'' he said.

<HEAD>Producer-Financed Soybean Promotion, Research Program Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress was asked Wednesday to set up a $60
million soybean research and promotion program financed by a levy
on domestic soybean production.
   Proposed legislation, developed by the American Soybean
Association, would provide for a nationwide ``checkoff'' similar to
programs involving other commodities, including those for dairy,
pork and beef producers.
   Money from a mandatory assessment would pay for farmer-run
programs to expand exports, develop new uses for soybeans and
promote soybean products through a national advertising campaign.
   The program would be administered by state and national boards
composed of soybean producers.
   ``This program is and will be farmer-bred, farmer-fed and
farmer-led,'' said James Lee Adams, of Camilla, Ga., president of
the American Soybean Association.
   At a news conference, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said the
legislation would give ``American soybean farmers a war chest of
their own'' to combat promotional and research efforts of foreign
competitors.
   Currently, 26 states have soybean promotion programs generating
a total of about $15 million, and the national levy would replace
those.
   The proposed rate of assessment would be one-half percent of the
net market value of soybeans sold by a farmer _ 50 cents for every
$100 in sales. Half of the estimated $60 million in collections
would go to state programs.
   If the legislation is enacted, the assessment would be
implemented and a producer referendum would be held 18 to 36 months
later to determine whether it should continue.

   Uniform national standards on such things as
cleanliness and food quality at boarding homes for the elderly
would override state regulations and be enforced by surprise
inspections under legislation introduced Wednesday by Rep. Claude
Pepper.
   ``We need to act immediately to end the abuse of our elderly and
disabled,'' Pepper, D-Fla., said in a statement. ``This bill seeks
to eradicate what is truly a tragedy of epic proportions.''
   He said many of the homes visited by congressional inspectors
``weren't fit for roaches, let alone the frail elderly and disabled
people who were forced to live there.''
   A spokesman for the Select Committee on Aging's subcommittee on
health said Pepper, who has been under hospital care since April 6,
signed the legislation last week during a visit to his office and
it was formally filed with the House clerk Wednesday.
   In a subcommittee report released earlier, investigators
determined there are more 1 million elderly and disabled residents
living in more than 68,000 board and care homes.
   Pepper said subcommittee investigators conducted unannounced
inspections of board and care homes in 10 states and ``found
evidence of fraud, waste and abuse in every state.''
   Federal and state governments spend an estimated $7 billion a
year to support elderly and disabled people in the homes, mostly
through the federal Supplemental Security Income program.

<HEAD>Cambodian Peace Talks End with Reports of Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace talks involving three of
Cambodia's four factions ended Wednesday with glowing reports of
progress and plans for more negotiations.
   ``We have made tremendous progress. We achieved concrete
results,'' said Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former ruler of Cambodia
and leader of the three-party resistance coalition.
   ``I symbolize Cambodia,'' he said. All four factions want the
prince to return as head of state.
   The Khmer Rouge, which has the strongest army in the coalition,
did not attend the Jakarta meeting, the third in 10 months.
Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in December 1979 deposed the Khmer
Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of people during its
reign from 1975. The three other factions oppose its return to
power.
   Hun Sen, premier of the Vietnam-sponsored government in Phnom
Penh, spoke on Wednesday of ``quite big progress'' and the promise
of more to come.
   A Khmer Rouge radio broadcast said it rejected conciliatory
moves by Hun Sen's government as merely an effort to legitimize
itself.
   Sihanouk said: ``The Khmer Rouge will reject everything because
they are interested in the continuation of the war.'' He quoted Hun
Sen as saying, ``Let the Khmer Rouge stay in the jungle.''
   Even the more sober assessment of former premier Son Sann,
leader of the third guerrilla group, acknowledged points of
agreement at the Jakarta meeting. He issued a statement saying a
compromise was expected to resolve ``the external aspect'' of the
conflict that began with the invasion.
   Vietnam has pledged to withdraw all its military forces from
Cambodia by Sept. 30.
   Sihanouk said he would decide whether to return as head of state
after complete withdrawal of Vietnamese forces was confirmed and
the constitution was amended to guarantee a multi-party political
system.
   ``I think my demands will be met,'' he said.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Ali Alatas,
foreign minister of Indonesia, have been asked to devise an
international control plan and prepare a conference to consider it,
Son Sann said. The conference is scheduled for July 24-25 in Paris.
   Son Sann told reporters participants in the conference should
include the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council,
Japan, Australia, the four factions, Laos, Vietnam and members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations: the Philippines,
Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Brunei.
   The five permanent Security Council members are the United
States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.
   An international control plan is intended to keep the peace
between the Vietnamese withdrawal and elections. It probably will
include representatives of two Western nations, two communist
countries and two from the group professing non-alignment.
   Sihanouk and Son Sann, who lead non-communist resistance groups,
had demanded a U.N. peacekeeping force but agreed to compromise.
   In return, Hun Sen had his National Assembly change the
country's name from People's Republic of Kampuchea to the State of
Cambodia and promised several constitutional and other changes.
   Son Sann and Sihanouk were not content with the changes,
however, and Son Sann's statement said: ``We agree to disagree on
the internal aspect.''
   He accused Hun Sen of wanting to take the two non-communist
factions into his party and freeze out the communist Khmer Rouge in
hopes of getting the recognition at the conference that has been
withheld by the United Nations. The resistance coalition holds
Cambodia's seat in the U.N. General Assembly.
   The guerrilla factions want a four-party coalition during the
interim from Vietnamese withdrawal to elections.

   Thunderstorms with locally heavy rain developed Wednesday over
parts of Texas and Louisiana, and rain was widely scattered over
other sections of the nation.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed along a warm front over much
of eastern Texas and western Louisiana in the afternoon. Near
Houston, a thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph at Hobby Airport,
the National Weather Service said.
   Waco, Texas, got 1.01 inches of rain in the six hours before 1
p.m. CDT.
   An upper level weather disturbance moving southeastward into the
central Plains produced showers over parts of eastern Wyoming,
western South Dakota and Nebraska.
   Low pressure and a trailing cold front spread showers over
western Oregon and northwestern California.
   Elsewhere, a cold front over southern Canada spread clouds over
much of the Northeast, with showers over northern Maine, with
clouds also over parts of the upper Ohio Valley and lower Great
Lakes.
   Afternoon readings were only in the 40s over parts of the
Northeast, the central high Plains and the northern Rockies.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 39
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 95 at Gila Bend,
Ariz. Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 was 28 at Alamosa, Colo.,
and Marquette, Mich.
   For Thursday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
northeastern Texas and the central Gulf Coast states to the Ohio
Valley and the middle Mississippi Valley. A cold front was expected
to spread scattered showers over the upper Mississippi Valley and
the northern Plains. Rain was forecast over the northern Rockies.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted over northern Maine and much of
Montana; mostly in the 60s 70 from New England to the Ohio Valley
and the Great Lakes region, and from the upper Mississippi Valley
to the central Rockies; above 80 across much of California,
Arizona, New Mexico and southern Nevada, and from Texas to Florida;
and in the 90s or above 100 in the desert Southwest.

   President Bush took a break from a tightly
scheduled potpourri of meetings Wednesday for an afternoon tennis
game with pro Bjorn Borg and two other Swedes.
   Bush and Borg teamed up against Swedish Ambassador Wilhelm
Wachtmeister and Ove Benstson, a former Davis Cup champion, in a
doubles match on the White House court.
   The president, dressed in white shorts and shirt with a yellow
vest and a white windbreaker that he shed after about 10 minutes of
warming up, energetically raced across the court and bounded back
and forth to the net.
   He apologized for his bad shots and hit his share of good ones.
   One shot into the net produced a particular grimace from the
president and an expletive between clenched teeth. ``Sorry,'' he
said quickly.
   When a reporter complimented the president on his game, Bush
replied, ``Answer to this game is to get a good partner.''
   But Bush's serve failed him in the first set. He double faulted
to lose the game point. With that, the small group of reporters and
camera crews on hand to observe were escorted back to the White
House press quarters. The score at that point was 2-1, in favor of
the president's team.

<TEXT>
   With final exams just two weeks away, a
union of 3,200 graduate assistants walked out of University of
California-Berkeley classrooms Wednesday and onto picket lines to
press a demand for recognition as employees.
   ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Union busting's got to go!'' sign-carrying
teaching and research assistants chanted as they demonstrated at
every major entrance to the campus.
   Their union based here, the Association for Graduate Student
Employees, is affiliated with the United Auto Workers, and is the
vanguard of a burgeoning movement challenging the traditional view
of graduate students as scholars living off stipends. The students
say they are underpaid, overworked and often forced to go without
health and other benefits.
   ``This is not a question of mainly getting more money for me;
it's a matter of justice,'' said James Martel, a 24-year-old
teaching assistant in the political science department.
   ``We're not a bunch of Berkeley radicals demanding a change in
foreign policy; we just want to exercise a basic American right to
join a union and have our concerns represented at a bargaining
table,'' added Martel, who joined about 200 pickets as classes were
to begin.
   Union representatives claimed hundreds of classes were canceled
on the first day of the two-day strike. The university did not
check the number of canceled classes, but a Berkeley spokesman
called the protest largely symbolic.
   About 90 percent ot the 3,200 graduate assistants took part in
the walkout, the association claimed. There are about 9,000
graduate students at Berkeley.
   A victory by the Berkeley students could legitimize similar
demands eat many more campuses, said David Lambert, a member of the
association's executive board.
   ``The movement nationally on this issue is picking up steam,''
Lambert said. ``We're not making demands in a vacuum.''
   In the last 10 years, at least five major universities in
Florida, Wisconsin, Michigan, Oregon and New Jersey have recognized
graduate student assistants as employees.
   Teaching assistants at the University of Wisconsin in Madison
won collective bargaining from the Legislature in 1985. Their
union, affiliated with the American Federation of Teachers, is
negotiating their second contract.
   At the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, the university and
its newly organized teaching assistants reached a collective
bargaining agreement earlier this year giving assistants a 14
percent pay raise over the next two years.
   At the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the coordinating
committe of the teaching assistants' union voted last week to
affiliate with the UAW.
   The Berkeley union has been seeking recognition since 1983. Last
week, the state Public Employment Relations Board, ruling 2-1 in
favor of a university appeal, said a 1979 law forbids graduate
students from being treated as employees because their work duties
are part of scholarly training.
   The association plans to appeal to court.
   At the start of Berkeley's school day, Sproul Plaza, where
one-fifth of students generally enter, was unusually quiet.
Protesters handed out yellow armbands to supporters.
   ``The teaching assistants are the university when it comes to
learning here,'' said undergraduate Cammy Starks, 21, who said her
morning classes had been canceled and wore an armband. ``Everything
I've learned, I've learned from the assistants, not professors who
hardly ever get to know you.''
   Anthropology Professor Gerald Berreman, who joined pickets, said
graduate students handle 90 percent of the paper grading. ``I'm
here to show them how important they are to faculty,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, 71 professors in 10 departments sent a letter to
Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman endorsing the walkout and the
association's call for teaching assistants to cancel or reschedule
classes. Berkeley has 1,350 tenured professors.
   The association said that at least 500 Wednesday and Thursday
classes were canceled or rescheduled.
   According to a selective survey by the association of 307
classes through Wednesday afternoon, 66 percent were canceled, 25
percent were less than half-full, and 9 percent were at capacity.
   University spokesman Tom Debley said the results were not
necessarily representative of the campus, which has 23,000
undergraduates. He said it's not unusual for some students to skip
classes in the final weeks before finals to gain time to prepare
papers.
   Debley said the cost of pay raises and for providing health and
other benefits could have a substantial impact on university
budgets.
   According to a study by the association, teaching assistants
handle 58 percent of classroom work involving undergraduate
students and research assistants do about half the laboratory work.
   The university contends the work cannot be considered employment
because it is so intertwined with educational experience, Debley
said. Students receive annual stipends from the university or
research institutions averaging about $10,000 annually.
   ``It is more of a learning experience than an employment
experience,'' Debley said.

<HEAD>Argentine Couple Accused Of Stealing Children Extradited</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paraguay on Wednesday extradited an
Argentine couple accused of stealing two children whose mother
disappeared during Argentina's ``dirty war'' against subversion in
the 1970s.
   Samuel Miara, a former Argentine federal policeman, his wife
Alicia and the 12-year-old twins, Gonzalo and Matias, were placed
aboard an Argentine commercial jetliner on a regular flight to
Buenos Aires.
   The Miaras say the twins are theirs.
   ``The children feel very badly and obviously I'm not doing too
well either,'' Miara told reporters shortly before police arrived
at their Asuncion home to take them to the airport.
   Another couple, former Argentine Army Maj. Norberto Bianco and
his wife Susana, are awaiting final legal proceedings in a similar
case involving two children.
   Both couples fled to Paraguay, then under the rule of
authoritarian president Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, in April 1986
after human rights groups accused them of stealing children of
pregnant women who disappeared during a military crackdown on
leftist subversion.
   Both couples refused to return to Argentina, claiming they were
victims of political persecution and would not receive a fair trial.
   Argentine requests for the extradition of the couples were tied
up in the courts for two years and strained relations between the
two nations. Argentine Ambassador Raul Quijano was recalled for
three months in 1987 after the Paraguayan attorney general
recommended against extradition.
   Stroessner and his 34-year regime were ousted in a military coup
on Feb. 3. Gen. Andres Rodriguez, elected president in Monday's
national elections, and the Supreme Court approved extradition of
the Miaras on March 6.
   Adalberto Rossetti, who claims to be the real father of the
Miara boys, has said that his wife, Liliana, 21 at the time, was
four months pregnant when she was arrested by security forces for
allegedly subversive activity as a student at the University of La
Plata. She never was seen again.
   Rossetti, an attorney in Buenos Aires, said he has never seen
the boys.

   The judge in the Oliver North trial said
Wednesday he has imposed a 9-to-5 workday on the jury but won't
push harder for a verdict in the deliberations, which continued
inconclusively for the 11th day.
   ``I see no reason why I should intervene with the jury at all,''
U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell told lawyers for North and
the government _ both of whom had raised questions about the
lengthy deliberations.
   ``There is nothing the court can do to say that people must
deliberate,'' he said. ``I have no reason to think they aren't
deliberating; they are human beings and they are going to set their
own pace.''
   Gesell pointed out that ``not long ago a jury in this courthouse
took two months to reach a decision'' _ apparently referring to the
trial of nine members of a Black Hebrew sect convicted on
racketeering charges in 1986 by a jury that deliberated 200 hours
over 36 days.
   The nine women and three men on the North jury generally have
worked on the case five or six hours each weekday and a half-day on
Saturday.
   ``I felt that time was being wasted,'' Gesell said. ``They are
not starting as early as they could have and they have been leaving
at 4:15. I felt I should hold them in there until five.''
   He said he told U.S. marshals, who transport the jurors from the
hotel where they are sequestered, ``to get them in by nine and take
them home by five.''
   And so, at 5:03 p.m., the van pulled away from the courthouse
and the jury had completed another seven hours of work _ a total of
about 60 hours since it got the case on April 20. A court official
said deliberations stopped at 4:45.
   Prosecutor John Keker had suggested that Gesell might summon
jurors to the courtroom each day to learn what hours they wanted to
work the following day and to advise them they could deliberate
longer.
   The judge said the new hours would take care of that and an
eight-hour day was reasonable. The jurors, he said, worked shorter
days earlier because several suffered from colds and one had
problems with high blood pressure.
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked why the jurors, who had been
using Gesell's courtroom, had returned to a smaller deliberation
room where they had complained of being crowded.
   Gesell said he needed the courtroom for other business and the
crowding problem had been solved by removing excess chairs.
   ``I think we'll just have to wait it out together until we hear
something concrete from them,'' he told the lawyers.
   Keker replied that ``we are running out of books (to read) in
our office.''
   Said Gesell: ``I understand there is a movie you could look at''
_ an apparent reference to the two-part television drama on ``The
Rise and Fall of Oliver North'' that finished Tuesday night.
   Charges against North include lying to Congress and the attorney
general and obstructing investigations into the Iran-Contra affair,
particularly his White House efforts to help the Nicaraguan rebels
at a time when official U.S. aid was banned. Other charges accuse
North of illegally profiting from the enterprise.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department urged Gesell to deny a news
media request for a document that was given to the jury but not to
the press. The department said the news organizations should pursue
the matter through the Defense Department _ ``the executive branch
agency responsible for classifying the information at issue.''
   Said the Justice Department: ``This court cannot serve as a
substitute for such a process.''
   The organizations pressing for the document _ a summary of
intelligence ``intercepts'' made while a shipment of missiles was
being sent to Iran in 1985 _ are The Associated Press; Cable News
Network Inc.; Capital Cities-ABC Inc.; CBS Inc.; Dow Jones &amp; Co.
Inc.; National Broadcasting Co. Inc.; National Public Radio; The
New York Times Co.; the Times Mirror Co., and The Washington Post.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Says US-Japan Reach Tentative Agreement On Driftnet Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Japan have reached a
tentative agreement over driftnet fishing in the northern Pacific
Ocean, Rep. Jolene Unsoeld said Wednesday.
   Unsoeld, D-Wash., outlined details of what she said is an
agreement that might end the dispute over use of the huge nets. She
was critical of the pact.
   An estimated 700 fishing boats from Taiwan, South Korea and
Japan use driftnets, which can stretch 35 miles in length and cover
more than 30,000 square miles of ocean on any given day.
   American fishermen claim that vessels from Taiwan, South Korea
and Japan use driftnets to illegally snare millions of tons of
salmon under the guise of squid fishing. Fishing groups have said
the illegal fishing has already impacted salmon runs in Alaska,
Washington state and Oregon.
   Unsoeld, D-Wash., released what she said are details of the
pact, based on talks with unnamed officials from the State
Department and the U.S. fishing industry.
   She said the pact calls for:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _ 2 observers stationed aboard Japanese driftnet vessels to
monitor their catch. There are an estimated 400 vessels in the
Japanese driftnet fleet.
   _ An increase from four to five in the number of Japanese patrol
vessels in the North Pacific and an increase in patrol days for the
vessels from the current 250 per year to 600 per year. U.S.
enforcement officers will be stationed aboard the patrol vessels.
   _ Stiffer Japanese penalties for ships caught illegally driftnet
fishing.
   _ Marking of all driftnets so the owners of those cast adrift
can be identified.
   _ A ban on the high-seas transfer of fish between Japanese
trawlers and freighters, which carry the fish back to port.
   Unsoeld said the Japanese refused to agree to a U.S. State
Department request for a pilot program to place transponders on a
dozen or so Japanese vessels. Using satellites, the U.S. could have
monitored the movements of the ships.
   The U.S. is considering a transponder test using American
vessels, Unsoeld said.
   Other congressional sources, who asked not to be identified,
confirmed most of the details supplied by Unsoeld, but added that
the agreement was for only one year and the Japanese have
essentially told the State Department ``take it or leave it.''
   The sources also said the Japanese have indicated they plan to
move the legal driftnet zone slightly northward, though exactly how
far remains unclear.
   The existing driftnet zone was designed to keep fishing vessels
far south of the migration routes of North American salmon.
   Ed Wolfe, the State Department's ambassador for ocean and
fisheries, was out of his office and unavailable for comment
Wednesday. Earlier this week, Wolfe told a House subcommittee that
an agreement with the Japanese was close.
   Congressional sources said the agreement has actually been
signed by Japanese officials and initialed by U.S. negotiators.
   ``I am extremely apprehensive that this agreement will not be
adequate,'' said Unsoeld. ``I am also not sure that this will meet
the requirements of the 1987 Driftnet Act.''
   Under that act, if Japan and other countries with driftnet
fleets have not entered into monitoring and enforcement agreements
with the United States by June 29, the president could impose trade
sanctions.
   Unsoeld said she was upset that the Japanese had refused to
agree to a transponder test program.
   ``We may have negotiated away our ability to put any teeth in
our action,'' she said. ``It's absolutely goofy. If they aren't
violating any existing agreements, why are they objecting to us
placing transponders on their ships?''
   Unsoeld also said she felt the number of observers called for in
the agreement falls short of what was needed to provide
``sufficient'' data on the impact of driftnet fishing.

   A Palestinian shouting ``God is great!''
stabbed to death two elderly Israelis and wounded three others
Wednesday at a bus stop in the heart of Jewish west Jerusalem,
police said.
   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian laborer stabbed and
slightly wounded a Jew from Etz Efraim, a small settlement near the
Arab city of Qalqilya, the army said. Israel radio said the
settler, 38-year-old Levi Meshumar, was stabbed five times.
   After the stabbing in Jerusalem, police used tear gas to break
up a march by Jewish extremists, who were led by American-born
Rabbi Meir Kahane and shouted ``Revenge!'' Kahane and six followers
were arrested on charges of disturbing public order and refusing
orders to disperse.
   Members of Kahane's anti-Arab Kach party later beat up several
Arabs near a Jewish Orthodox neighborhood, Israel army radio
reported.
   West Jerusalem has been relatively free of violence that has
plagued Arab east Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip since the Palestinian uprising began 17 months ago.
   The stabbing occurred on Jaffa Road, the city's busiest shopping
street, at about 11 a.m. Dozens of passers-by chased and caught the
25-year-old attacker as he fled with a bloody, eight-inch knife.
Police dragged the suspect into a nearby flower shop to protect him
from an angry crowd shouting: ``Death to the terrorists! Death to
the Arabs!''
   Vardi Kalman, a 60-year-old lawyer, died shortly afterward.
   Nissim Levy, 91, died later in a hospital. The other victims,
including a woman in her 90s, were in fair condition.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir linked the stabbing to PLO head
Yasser Arafat's current visit to France.
   ``This is a cruel murder by fanatical savages, mad with hate,
who are pushed to such acts also by this kind of visits. When they
see their leader and idol, Arafat, received in presidential
palaces, they know he's received their thanks for their killings,''
he said.
   Speaking on Israel Television, Shamir said it did not matter to
what group the attacker belonged because his act was in Arafat's
``spirit and according to his orders and the orders of his friends.
They have not changed and are not able to change anything in their
ideology, aspirations, hopes and aims.''
   There was speculation the stabbing came in response to Arafat's
statement in Paris disavowing the PLO charter, which calls for the
elimination of Israel. Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the
assailant was a member of Islamic Jihad, a fundamentalist Moslem
group opposed to Israel's existence.
   He added that the attacker's brother ``was apparently detained
and maybe beaten during the weekend, and this was the background,''
in addition to nationalistic and religious motives.
   The deaths brought to 20 the number of Israelis killed in the
uprising. More than 450 Palestinians have died.
   Jerusalem Police Commissioner David Krauss said he was calling
in reinforcements to protect the city's Arab residents.
   ``We will have to keep these forces here for days to prevent any
attempt on innocent people, be they Jews or Arabs,'' he said.
   Police said the Jerusalem assailant had been questioned about
unspecified ``terrorist activities'' in the past. They said he
apparently had no accomplices.
   Romi Shimon, who was sitting in a nearby restaurant when the
attack occurred, said the man shouted ``Allahu Akbar!'' _ ``God is
great!'' in Arabic.
   ``He was going crazy and started stabbing people,'' Shimon said.
   Sima Ozer, an employee in a nearby flower shop, said the Arab
was caught outside.
   ``A policeman came and stopped the crowd from lynching him,''
she said. ``Police threw him on the floor of the flower shop ...
while people outside were shouting, `Kill him! Kill him! Death to
the Arabs!'''

<HEAD>Japanese Products Could Face Stiff Duties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills on
Wednesday released a target list of Japanese products which could
face 100 percent duties, doubling their price in this country,
under trade retaliation being considered by the Bush administration.
   The list of potential target products for the higher tariffs
ranges from color televisions to tape recorders and photocopying
machines.
   The broad variety of goods, including some of the most popular
Japanese electronic devices sold in this country, served to
emphasize the seriousness with which the Bush administration is
viewing this latest trade dispute with Japan.
   Mrs. Hills announced on Friday that the government was
considering sanctions against Japan because of a finding by the
administration that the country has not opened its
telecommunications market to American companies.
   Mrs. Hills said at the time that the retaliation could be
avoided if the Japanese make meaningful concessions.
   A final list of products which could be subject to the higher
tariffs will be drawn up after a hearing scheduled for May 24. That
list will be selected from the broader one released on Wednesday.
   In making the telecommunications decision, Mrs. Hills found that
Japan had limited U.S. access to its market for car telephones and
business radios.
   The Motorola Co., the principal American maker of these
products, has contended that it has been denied access to the
Japanese market. It maintains that with fair access it could
achieve sales in Japan of about $400 million a year.
   The Japanese have argued that there is a shortage of radio
frequencies for such services.

<HEAD>Chelsea-Boston University Contract Signed, Delivered to Lawmakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHELSEA, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston University's controversial plan to
run Chelsea's ailing schools went to state lawmakers Wednesday,
with supporters confident the promised renaissance will dispel
doubts about putting a public concern in private hands.
   ``This is the happiest day of my 45 years in Chelsea,'' said
Mayor John Brennan, who sent the Legislature a home rule petition
that would install Boston University as manager of its school
system.
   The proposal has the backing of Democrat Richard Voke, chairman
of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, and is expected to
pass. Others were less enthusiastic.
   School Committee Chairwoman Elizabeth McBride was against the
proposal, citing concerns that the university would not consult
with parents, teachers and administrators.
   Supporters say the plan is Chelsea's last chance to escape the
plague of poverty: shabby buildings, low test scores and a high
school dropout rate of 17 percent.
   Opponents, including teachers and Hispanic groups, say the
proposal also would turn Chelsea into a experimental education
laboratory for university students.
   Hispanics oppose the contract, signed by representatives of
Boston University and Chelsea's schools, saying university
officials have ignored requests for more information about
bilingual programs.
   Boston University President John Silber said he would heed
concerns raised.
   ``We are not going to privatize the schools,'' Silber said. ``We
are going to manage the public schools and they are going to remain
public.''
   The Massachusetts Federation of Teachers criticized the signing
of the contract before lawmakers act as ``indicative of the private
and arrogant manner in which the entire process ... has been
conducted.''
   Chelsea, a city of about 25,000 with a sizable immigrant
population, has seen its tax base shrink and faces cuts of about
$2.8 million in next year's school budget due to a statewide budget
crunch.
   Silber said he would lobby for funds from private donors, the
federal government and the state, advertising the reforms of
Chelsea as a possible road to reviving the area a few miles from
Boston.
   ``Chelsea is a city waiting for a renaissance to happen,''
Silber said. ``If we can improve those schools, people will move
back into Chelsea.''

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Recreation Bill Despite GOP Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee on Wednesday
approved legislation to protect open land and build recreational
facilities, but Republicans on the committee walked out in protest
before the committee took its vote.
   The bill, known as the American Heritage Trust Act, would make
the existing land and water conservation fund and historic
preservation fund permanent trusts that would generate $1 billion a
year for land acquisition and construction of recreational
facilities like golf courses, ball fields, pools and marinas.
   Republicans on the committee objected to more government buying
of land.
   ``This nation's heritage is private ownership of land, not
public owners and control,'' said Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
   But Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., chairman of the committee, said
the bill is necessary because too many communities in the United
States are being overdeveloped with insufficient recreational
facilities.
   Craig said the Republicans walked out when it became apparent
that amendments they offered would not get through.

   Britain and India on Wednesday denied involvement
in any plot to return exiled King Zahir Shah of Afghanistan to
power.
   Independent Television News said Tuesday that Britain, the
Soviet Union and India were involved in a scheme that was foiled by
Afghan rebels who cut off Kandahar airport in southern Afghanistan,
and prevented the king's return. ITV quoted Moslem rebels fighting
the Marxist government in Kabul as its source.
   ``There's no question of us being involved,'' said a Foreign
Office spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom.
   ``We're not a player of that degree (in the region) and as far
as we're aware no one is.''
   In New Delhi, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aftab Seth said: ``I
would second the comments by (the) British Foreign Office
spokesman.''
   In Rome, where the exiled king lives, his spokesman, Gen. Abdul
Wali, said Tuesday: ``I know nothing about it.''
   The 74-year-old king has lived in Rome since he was ousted in a
1973 coup.

   A federal grand jury on Wednesday indicted two
men, including a former top city official who is a friend of Mayor
Marion S. Barry Jr., on charges they steered $3 million in
contracts to friends.
   Prosecutors alleged that some of the money in what they
described as ``a seamy web of corruption,'' ended up in Barry's
1986 reelection campaign fund, but they didn't say how.
   A source familiar with Barry's 1986 campaign, commenting on
condition he not be named, said the two indicted men organized an
Atlanta fund-raiser for Barry's reelection bid. The indictment does
not mention the Atlanta event.
   David E. Rivers, who formerly served as director of the city's
human services department, and John B. Clyburn, a prominent
contractor, were indicted on charges of conspiring to defraud the
city government by steering health services contracts to friends
and to a company owned by Clyburn.
   Rivers, a close friend of Barry, also faces two counts of
agreeing to accept a bribe, while Clyburn has been charged with
helping to bribe him.
   Barry said in a prepared statement, ``I should remind the public
that an indictment does not automatically mean an individual is
guilty.'' He added, ``I will have no further comment. ... My focus
continues to be on managing the District of Columbia government.''
   The charges come after a 21-month grand jury probe that followed
a two-year undercover FBI investigation into the city's contracting
procedures.
   If convicted of all charges, the two men could face maximum
prison terms of 50 years.
   ``This indictment alleged a seamy web of corruption, of
concealment, of manipulation and of self-dealing by one of the most
senior officials in the District of Columbia government,'' said
U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens. ``The investigation is continuing
... and a number of other issues remain in this case.''
   Stephens alleged that both Clyburn and Rivers took ``about 10
percent off the top'' in kickbacks for the 20 contracts and
contract extensions mentioned in the indictment.
   He declined to elaborate on how much money might have been
steered to Barry's 1986 reelection bid, or whether the mayor or any
of his top campaign officials were aware of the situation.
   Rivers was out of town Wednesday, his attorney John Mercer said.
Mercer said before the indictment was announced that he was unaware
of any pending charges.
   The 49-page indictment charges that from 1983 through May 1987,
Rivers and Clyburn influenced the city's contracting process to
steer both sole-source and competitively-bid contracts to their
friends.
   Rivers took a leave of absence from his city job in August 1987
after he became a target of the investigation.

   A judge who freed a man imprisoned for 21
years in the poisoning deaths of his seven children said the
killer's identity may never be known, and raised several questions
about the investigation and prosecution.
   James Richardson, 53, was released from prison April 25 after
Judge Clifton Kelly determined his 1968 trial was unfair. The
former orange picker has moved to a diet clinic run by former
comedian Dick Gregory in Fort Walton Beach.
   A written order overturning Richardson's conviction was filed
Tuesday by Kelly, a retired circuit judge appointed to hear the
case. Kelly offered a long list of unresolved questions in the case.
   Janet Reno, a special prosecutor who found evidence of
substantial trial errors and perjured testimony, still must
recommend whether Richardson should face retrial.
   He was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder in the
poisoning death of his eldest stepdaughter Oct. 25, 1967.
   Kelly's order asked who should be blamed for the unfair trial,
why anyone would have wanted to frame Richardson as the defense
contended, and why three cellmates who testified against Richardson
told contradictory stories.
   The judge also wondered how a wino who lived near the
Richardsons found a bag of the pesticide parathion after an
unsuccessful police search, why former police chief Richard Barnard
was told to stay off the case, how family baby sitter Betsy Resse
served the poisoned meal and why parathion was found in other parts
of the apartment.
   ``At this late date, who really poisoned the children will quite
likely never be known,'' Kelly wrote.
   Prosecutors claimed Richardson poisoned the children to collect
on $1,000 insurance policies, but the jury was never told that the
insurance hadn't been purchased.
   Because Reno and Richardson's attorneys agreed the trial was
unfair, Kelly said, ``It would serve no useful purpose for the
court to now make a detailed finding of fact.''
   Kelly didn't rule on whether prosecutors or investigators
suppressed evidence or committed perjury. Gov. Bob Martinez ordered
an investigation of the allegations of public wrongdoing after
Richardson was freed.

   A Palm Springs woman who rushed out of
her shower to dance to a Gladys Knight video and was arrested after
neighbors peering through her window filed a complaint has sued the
police.
   Darleen Scott, who was jailed and lost her two girls to the
state for two days, sued the Palm Springs Public Safety Department
on Tuesday for false arrest, harassment and false imprisonment in
the January 1988 incident.
   ``I was treated like a murderer, like I was no good. I was in my
own house minding my own business,'' said Ms. Scott, a 31-year-old
nurse's aide.
   She said she had asked her daughters to call her out of the
shower if a music video of the song ``Love Overboard'' by Gladys
Knight and the Pips appeared on the television.
   Neighbors peering through a window into her third-floor
apartment thought she was nude when she rushed into her living room
to dance to the song, and filed a child abuse report with the
police. She later told officers she was wearing a brown towel.
   She was arrested on three counts of lewd and lascivious behavior
in the presence of a child _ her two daughters and a 14-year-old
girl looking through the window, said West Palm Beach attorney W.
Trent Steele, who is representing Ms. Scott on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   While she spent a night in the Palm Beach County Stockade, her
daughters, aged three and 10 at the time, spent about two days in
separate foster homes.
   The separation was prolonged because social workers with the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services ``couldn't
find one of the girls'' after they placed her in a home, Steele
said.
   The State Attorney's Office dropped all the charges against
Scott in May 1988.
   Palm Springs Village Attorney Donald Kohl declined comment on
the suit, saying he had not seen it.
   Ms. Scott's suit charges the Public Safety Department deprived
her of state and constitutional rights and failed to teach officers
how to handle alleged child abuse cases.
   The complaint also says police ignored accepted practice by not
allowing social workers to investigate before taking the children
away from the mother.

<HEAD>Man Found Drifting South Of Hawaii Says Fish Fumes Killed Crew</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Yap islander found drifting in a life raft
told authorities he abandoned his tuna boat after fumes from
rotting fish apparently killed two other men aboard the vessel,
according to the Coast Guard.
   Coast Guard and Navy ships were sent to tow the vessel to port,
but their crews were warned to stay upwind to avoid the fumes.
   Lawrence Moon, who was safely aboard the Coast Guard cutter Cape
Corwin on Wednesday, told authorities he abandoned the 85-foot,
Seattle-based trawler Margaret G after fumes overcame two crewmates
``in a matter of seconds,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Keith
Spangler.
   Moon told officials after his rescue Tuesday that the trawler's
refrigeration system failed during a trip to Honolulu that began
April 22 at American Samoa, a U.S. territory about 2,300 miles
south of Hawaii, Spangler said. Yap, part of the Federated States
of Micronesia, is about 540 miles southwest of Guam.
   Moon said that on Sunday, the other crewmember went down into a
hold and did not return, and when the captain went to investigate,
he was also overcome, leaving Moon alone, according to Spangler.
   Moon told authorities he headed the vessel toward Honolulu but
had problems with a steering linkage and later a generator
malfunction, Spangler said.
   On Monday, Moon said, he woke to find himself succumbing to the
fumes, so he abandoned the vessel after closing all the hatches,
Spangler said.
   Spangler said the crewmen may have been overcome by hydrogen
sulfide, which is produced by rotting organic material.
   ``It is very toxic and it takes the oxygen out of the air,''
Spangler said. ``If it's rotting fish, this could happen.''
   The Japanese ship Sun Harvest rescued Moon Tuesday evening 300
miles south of Honolulu. Spangler said Moon was later transferred
to the Coast Guard cutter and was reported in ``good condition and
good spirits.''
   Coast Guard and Navy ships were at the scene Wednesday but were
instructed to remain 2,000 yards upwind from the Margaret G,
Spangler said. Crewmembers were told to rig the vessel for towing
but not to go below deck, he added.
   ``The fumes are really bad,'' he said. ``The vessel will be
towed to Honolulu, but a decision has not been made what to do
after that.''
   Spangler said the investigation was complicated by the fact that
hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible.
   Moon's raft was spotted Tuesday morning by the crew of a Coast
Guard plane following an emergency distress beacon signal that was
picked up by commercial aircraft and the worldwide Search and
Rescue Satellite Assisted Tracking computer system, said spokesman
Dave Goff.
   Moon was about two miles from the Margaret G, which when viewed
from the air showed no evidence of damage and no sign of life,
Spangler said.
   A Coast Guard life raft containing a radio and food and water
was dropped, and Moon swam to it from his raft to await pickup by
the Japanese ship, Goff said.

<HEAD>Investigation, Manhunt Continue in Drug-Cult Murder Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The international investigation of a
murderous cult of suspected drug smugglers continued Wednesday,
officials said, but the reported high priest and priestess of the
group remained at large.
   Fifteen people found last month buried west of the border city
of Matamoros, Mexico, are believed to be victims of the drug gang.
Some of the dead were mutilated in human sacrificial rites intended
to bring magical power to the contraband business, officials and
suspects said.
   Four of the five men in custody in Matamoros said the cult
leaders were Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and Sara Aldrete
Villarreal, 24. Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete, missing since the first
12 bodies were uncovered April 11, are among 11 people indicted in
the United States on a four-count drug indictment.
   The pair flew from McAllen to Mexico City on April 11, officials
have said. In the Mexican capital, the investigation has led to
searches of residences where occult altars were found.
   Only one of the 11 indicted in the United States, Serafin
Hernandez Rivera, 45, of Brownsville, is in U.S. custody.
Hernandez, who has pleaded innocent, is being held without bond,
awaiting a trial set for May 30 in Brownsville.
   Oran Neck, agent-in-charge with U.S. Customs in Brownsville,
said U.S. officials daily discuss the investigation with the
Mexican Federal Judicial Police.
   ``In fact, I have two people over there right now talking to
them,'' Neck said Wednesday.
   He said in the United States, the probe continues to involve the
FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Cameron County Sheriff's
Department and customs.
   ``Every day we're getting more stuff together on the case,''
Neck said.
   Cameron County Sheriff's Lt. George Gavito also said the manhunt
continued Wednesday. ``We've gotten some leads,'' Gavito said.
   Comandante Juan Benitez Ayala, of the Mexican Federal Judicial
Police in Matamoros, was away from his office and could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo threatened on
Wednesday to invoke emergency powers, which could mean martial law,
if students and workers continue the kind of violent protest in
which six riot policemen were killed.
   He said his government was determined to stop the wave of
radical protest that has battered South Korea in recent weeks, but
he did not outline specific action in a televised speech to the
nation.
   ``If violence and illegal acts endanger democracy and the future
of the country, I would be obliged to invoke emergency measures as
empowered by the constitution,'' he said.
   South Korea's constitution permits the president to rule by
decree or impose martial law in cases of emergency.
   Radical students are trying to bring down Roh's government and
have forrmed alliances with striking workers. They are a powerful
minority on campuses, but lack public support because of their
extremism and violent tactics.
   Roh's warning responded to the killing of six riot troopers
early Wednesday at Dongui University in Pusan, a southern
stronghold of the opposition.
   People seldom are killed in South Korean protests. Riot officers
wear protective helmets and shields, along with fireproof fatigues,
and normally are armed only with tear gas and batons.
   The six who died were set afire when they broke into a room on
the seventh floor of the university library to free five comrades
held hostage. They were the first policemen killed since a riot
officer died in June 1987.
   Authorities said students seized the hostages Tuesday after a
violent demonstration against the firing of warning shots by police
on Monday when protesters menaced a police station.
   Students hurled firebombs and set fire to a barricade drenched
with paint thinner as the policemen were climbing over it. Some
officers wrapped in flames jumped out of windows and others were
burned to death or asphyxiated, police said.
   Ten officers were in critical condition and police said they
expected more to die. Officials said about 10 other policemen and
students suffered minor injuries.
   About 700 police raided the school, firing tear gas.
Eighty-eight arrests were reported and the hostages later were
freed unharmed.
   Jo Jong-suk, chief of the national police, resigned after about
150 officers in Pusan conducted a sit-down protest and accused
senior officers of mishandling the assault. His office said it was
the worst loss of police life in recent years.
   The Education Ministry ordered the Dongui campus closed
indefinitely.
   Roh said in his speech Wednesday: ``It has become clear that,
behind the flames that took the lives of young people, there are
revolutionary groups which resort to violence to achieve their
goals.''
   He said the government was prepared to crush radical groups and
halt what he called the use of universities and factories as
revolutionary bases. ``It is time for us to make a firm resolution
to mobilize whatever means to get rid of violence in this society.''
   Opposition leaders also denounced violence and urged students
and workers to end their protests.
   News reports Wednesday said the U.S. Cultural Center in the
provincial city of Kwangju, a frequent target of radical students,
would be closed temporarily and moved to a location as yet
undetermined.
   Police said they expected more violence in Masan, a
strike-ridden industrial city near Pusan where militant labor
groups scheduled a huge rally for Thursday. Thousands of workers in
the city held violent protests all last week.
   Officials said about 7,000 riot policemen were being assembled
in Masan and nearby Changwon. News reports said police set up
barricades Wednesday outside Masan and made arrests.
   About 3,800 officers have been injured this year by firebombs,
rocks, clubs and iron bars, police said. Police and government
officials are seeking laws to provide tough punishment for users of
firebombs.

   Premier Ruud Lubbers formally
submitted the resignation of his seven-year coalition government
Wednesday, and early elections are being scheduled for Sept. 6 or
13, the government announced.
   Elections had not been due until May 1990.
   The announcement followed a 90-minute visit by Lubbers to Queen
Beatrix late Wednesday, his second of the day, and talks between
the monarch and the leaders of all nine political parties
represented in Parliament.
   In his first meeting, Lubbers submitted the resignation of his
entire 13-minister, center-right Cabinet in a clash over part of a
$3.65 billion plan to clean up the heavily polluted Dutch
environment by the year 2010.
   The plan came under heavy fire from the right-wing People's
Party for Freedom and Democracy, junior partner in his government
since 1982. It objected to Lubbers' proposal to end certain income
tax deductions for Dutch commuters who daily drive long distances
to and from work.
   The party threatened a no-confidence motion, precipitating the
government's fall.
   Lubbers' Cabinet will stay on as caretaker until a new
government is formed.
   Political observers predict Lubbers, of the Christian Democratic
Appeal party, will drop the People's Party for Freedom and
Democracy in a new coalition that would include the left-wing Labor
Party.
   Never in postwar Dutch history has any single party garnered
enough votes in the 150-seat Parliament to form a government on its
own.

<HEAD>Police Arrest Two Men Who Claim They Helped Soviet Spy Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men who wrote a book claiming they helped
Soviet spy George Blake escape to Moscow from a London jail 33
years ago were arrested on Wednesday.
   Patrick Pottle, 50, and Michael Randle, 55, went to a London
police sation at the request of the police and were arrested,
Scotland Yard said.
   They were then escorted to their homes, Pottle in London and
Randle in the northern town of Bradford, Yorkshire.
   They were not charged. A police spokesman, speaking anonymously,
said they would be granted bail while a report was sent to the
Director of Public Prosectuions, who is responsible for deciding on
prosecution.
   Officers from Scotland Yard's Special Branch, which deals with
subversion, were searching Pottle's home when a reporter telephoned
him.
   ``They are putting things in bags. I've been expecting this, so
I gathered some items together and they have been in a pile on the
kitchen table for about 10 days, waiting,'' Pottle said.
   Pottle, an antiques dealer, added that he and Randle, a
researcher, expect to go to prison eventually.
   A new book titled ``The Blake Escape'' by the two men and a TV
film about the case described how they harbored Blake after he
broke out of Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1966 and how Randle smuggled
him out of Britain in a camper van to East Germany.
   Sean Bourke, a former fellow prisoner of Blake, directed his
escape by radio messages. Bourke, now dead, later wrote a book
describing how he was invited to the Soviet Union and treated as a
hero by the Soviet KGB secret police.
   Bourke did not mention Pottle and Randle in his book. Last year,
they admitted their part in the case to a reporter.
   Blake was sentenced to 42 years and jailed in 1961 after
pleading guilty to spying for the Soviets throughout the 1950s
while working for MI6, the British intelligence gathering agency.
The sentence _ the longest sentence for espionage ever handed down
by a British court _ was regarded as representing one year for each
betrayed agent.
   At the end of a secret trial, the judge said Blake was suspected
of betraying 42 British agents in Eastern Europe who are believed
to have been killed.
   Pottle and Randle were founder members with the philosopher
Bertrand Russell of the Committee of 100, which protested nuclear
weapons. They met Blake in prison while serving 18-month sentences
for organizing a demonstration at a U.S. Air Force base.
   The two men said they helped the spy escape because they felt a
42-year sentence was inhumane.
   More than 100 lawmakers of the governing Conservative Party
signed a House of Commons paper demanding Pottle and Randle be
prosecuted.

   The Senate went on record Wednesday against
gasoline tax increases as it and the House cleared roadblocks to
approving budgets that carry out a much-criticized
deficit-reduction agreement with the White House.
   The anti-gas tax amendment, offered by Sen. Steve Symms,
R-Idaho, passed by voice vote and expressed the ``sense of the
Senate'' that motor fuel taxes should remain dedicated to
improvements in the highway and transportation system.
   The vote was a shot across the bow to those eyeing a rise in the
gas tax, now at 9.1 cents a gallon, as part of future
deficit-reduction efforts. There is no call for such a tax in the
$1.17 trillion fiscal 1990 spending plans now before Congress.
   Sources have said the Bush administration has been considering a
gas tax increase, combined with a reduction in the capital gains
tax, in the fiscal 1991 budget to be submitted next year.
   The current spending plan, which the House and the Senate are
considering in slightly different versions, claims about $28
billion in deficit reductions and would meet the goal in the
Gramm-Rudman law of a deficit no larger than $100 billion in fiscal
1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   Critics contend much of the alleged savings is illusory _
bookkeeping gimmicks, sales of federal assets and other devices
that do little to alleviate the government's long-term deficit
problem.
   The Senate's Democratic and Republican leaders withstood the
first serious challenge to their budget plan Wednesday evening,
defeating 64-31 a move by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to shift $3
billion from defense to education programs.
   Simon argued that for the nation to remain economically
competitive, ``There are going to have to be some changes in our
priorities.''
   But he ran into the opposition of the Senate's leadership, which
has defended Congress' budget deal with the White House and the
spending levels that the pact calls for.
   ``We made an agreement, and I believe it is a responsible and
fair agreement,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine.
   In the House, debate opened on that chamber's version of the
budget after passage of a resolution blocking all but a handful of
amendments _ those that House leaders believed would not pose a
threat to the deal.
   This budget is ``the best possible budget Congress can produce
for 1990, given the many constraints under which it was
developed,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the chairman of the
House Budget Committee. While not a ``bold approach, ... it is at
best a step in the right direction,'' he said.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the chairman of theHouse Ways and
Means Committee, has openly suggested a gas tax increase. But he
told the House he would not offer such legislation without Bush's
support.
   ``I will not encourage or support revenue increases that don't
have the support of the president and a majority of members of both
sides of the aisle on my committee,'' he said.
   Much of the Senate action Wednesday amounted to tinkering around
with priorities in the domestic area and passing non-binding
amendments regarding ``truth in budgeting.''
   The Senate approved amendments deploring the use of the Social
Security surplus to mask the size of the deficit. It also called
for future use of budget projections compiled by the Congressional
Budget Office, which are less sanguine than White House figures.
   It also voted to add $94 million for AIDS research, and about
$100 million for law enforcement by slightly reducing other
domestic agency budgets.
   The House planned votes Thursday on several amendments,
including a spending freeze plan and a proposal to impose a fee on
imported oil.
   Once the House and Senate complete their budgets, the two
chambers must agree on a single resolution. That document serves as
the guide for annual spending and tax legislation.
   To comply with the agreement reached last month with the White
House, the budgets follow totals already agreed to for military,
foreign aid and domestic spending. They also call for $14.2 billion
in new revenues from a variety of sources, including $5.3 billion
in tax increases.
   How the $5.3 billion will be raised remains uncertain. The
agreement with the White House allowed that decision to await more
discussions on what taxes Bush would agree do not violate his ``no
new taxes'' pledge.
   The Senate Finance Committee chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, indicated he would seek tax increases exceeding $5.3
billion to pay for some tax breaks that would cost the government
money.
   Bentsen did not specify what new taxes he supports. But he
listed several tax breaks he favors, including the tax credit for
research and development, and a cut in the Medicare surtax for
catastrophic illness insurance.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was
confident something could be worked out. He reminded reporters that
former President Reagan proposed and signed 13 tax hikes _ and yet
was seen as an enemy of higher taxes.

   Americans want the United Nations, not
national governments, to control nuclear and chemical weapons and
to take the lead in keeping peace in the world, according to a poll
released Wednesday.
   The Roper Organization survey also found strong support for
increased American financing of U.N. programs for peace, food
production, population control and health.
   In conflicts among countries where the United States has an
interest, U.N. forces should be used in an effort to accommodate
all parties, said 49 percent of the nearly 2,000 adults surveyed.
   Only 17 percent said the United States should use force to
impose its own solution; 20 percent said ``it depends,'' and 14
percent had no opinion.
   ``That is, in effect, a tough policy choice, and we were
surprised to see a 3-to-1 margin of support for U.N. intervention
rather than unilateral U.S. intervention,'' said Jeffrey Laurenti
of the U.N. Association of the U.S.A., a private non-profit group
that commissioned the poll.
   Of the respondents, 46 percent wanted America and other U.N.
members to spend more money settling regional conflicts peacefully,
11 percent favored less spending, 31 percent said the right amount
is spent now, and 11 percent had no opinion.
   The United Nations should have the power to control the
manufacture and spread of chemical weapons in the United States and
other countries, said 49 percent, but 33 percent opposed that and
18 percent were unsure.
   U.N. control over nuclear weapons manufacture and proliferation
was favored by 36 percent. The same percentage opposed it and 18
percent were unsure.
   Sixty percent said all U.N. members should pay their full dues
regularly rather than withholding funds to force changes. Fourteen
percent said funds could be withheld, the same number said ``it
depends'' and 12 percent had no opinion.
   President Reagan and Congress withheld more than a $500 million
from the United Nations in recent years to force fiscal reforms and
because they perceived an anti-Western bias in the organization.
   Reagan finally said the United States would pay all back dues if
current reforms continued, and President Bush has reaffirmed the
pledge.
   When asked how much money the United States and other U.N.
member countries should spend on U.N. projects, the respondents
favored more funds for most social programs, including eradicating
disease and improving health care; slowing population growth
through birth control; increasing world food production, and
protecting the environment.
   Burns Roper, head of the Roper Organization, said the poll
indicated for the first time in more than a decade that more
Americans thought the United Nations was doing a good job than felt
it was doing poorly.
   It was conducted March 11-18 through personal interviews with
nearly 2,000 adults chosen at random. Roper said the margin of
error was about 3 percent.

<HEAD>Singer James Brown Spends 56th Birthday in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soul singer James Brown spent an
apparently uneventful 56th birthday in prison Wednesday, with
corrections officials saying he had no visitors and probably no
birthday cake, either.
   Warden Judy Anderson at State Park Correctional Center said
unless Brown bought a cake from the canteen, he didn't have any
birthday cake. The prison menu included chocolate pudding for lunch
and sweet potato pie for dinner.
   ``He won't have any birthday cake or anything,'' said deputy
warden W.E. Doctor.
   Brown is serving a six-year sentence for aggravated assault and
failing to stop for police during a chase across the Georgia-South
Carolina border on Sept. 26.
   He works on kitchen detail in the mornings and in the evenings,
the ``Godfather of Soul,'' whose gold records include ``Please,
Please, Please,'' and ``Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' conducts the
prison choir.
   New York activist Al Sharpton said Wednesday in a telephone
interview from Brooklyn, N.Y., that he was continuing his efforts
to have Brown released from prison.
   ``James Brown has done six months. I think he's done enough
time,'' Sharpton said.
   Sharpton said he would protest the actions of a judge who last
week brought Brown from jail to the Richland County curthouse to
sign autographs.
   ``I think that his judge has underscored the point I was making
for six months, that this is a judicial joke to continue to hold
James Brown,'' Sharpton said of Circuit Judge Frank Eppes.
   In Chapel Hill, N.C., a group known as the North Carolina
Committee to Free James Brown, played tapes in front of a
courthouse as part of the ``Free James Brown Rally'' Wednesday.
   One of the organizers of the rally was Don Stanford, a trial
lawyer in Chapel Hill who loves Brown's music and who said he
thinks Brown is not getting a square deal.
   ``My position is this. I practice criminal law. I think six
years is just way out of line. It is a very harsh sentence,''
Stanford said.
   Brown did not have any visitors Wednesday, said Bennish Brown,
spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Corrections. The
singer's wife, Adrienne, was the only person who would have been
allowed to visit, but she did not show up, the spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who is no relation to Brown, said the Rev. Jesse
Jackson planned to visit the singer in prison Thursday morning.
   Jackson met with the singer in Columbia in February and appeared
before the state parole board on Brown's behalf on March 8.
   Brown will not be eligible for parole until mid-1991, said Tom
Hudson, spokesman for South Carolina Probation, Parole and Pardon
Services.

   U.S. and Japanese ships and planes on Wednesday
gave up the search for two crewmen washed overboard from a U.S.
Navy submarine off southwestern Japan two days earlier, officials
said.
   The Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard, ended its
search after sunset Wednesday, an agency official said on condition
of anonymity. He said the U.S. Navy told the agency it stopped
searching at noon Wednesday.
   U.S. military officials identified the sailors as Lt. Walter
Gray Womble III, 36, of Tampa, Fla., and James David Lear, 20, of
Washburn, Ill. Lear's rank was not available.
   A U.S. Air Force patrol plane and Navy ship, along with three
Japanese patrol boats and a Japanese plane, had been searching for
the two sailors since an unexpected wave washed three crewmen
overboard Monday from the diesel-powered submarine Barbel.
   One of the sailors was spotted by a plane and rescued by the
2,145-ton submarine. None of the three wore lifejackets, U.S.
military officials said.
   The submarine was off Japan's southernmost main island of
Kyushu, about 650 miles southwest of Tokyo, at the time of the
accident, the U.S. Military Liaison Office in Japan said.
   The Barbel, built in 1956, is equipped with six torpedo tubes
and had a crew of 77, a U.S. military official said on condition of
anonymity.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday announced
a partial resolution of a contentious trade dispute with the
12-nation European Community over the issue of hormones in American
beef.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said that both U.S. and European negotiators had
agreed to accept the initial recommendations of a task force
studying the dispute.
   That action will allow resumption of sales of about 15 percent
of the $100 million U.S. beef which is normally shipped to Europe.
However, a dispute over the other 85 percent of U.S. beef exports
remains to be resolved, U.S. officials said.
   Under the agreement, U.S. beef producers who wish to export beef
not treated with growth hormones to Europe may do so.
   But American officials said they still maintained that Europe's
ban on imports of beef from cattle raised on growth-producing
hormones represented an illegal trade barrier masquerading as a
health measure.
   American officials had refused to comply with the ban by
certifying Europe-bound beef as hormone-free and instead slapped
retaliatory tariffs on European goods valued at about $100 million,
a sum equal to the lost sales of American beef.
   However, after the tariffs were imposed on Jan. 1 by the Reagan
administration, officials of the incoming Bush administration began
to search for a compromise to the dispute.
   At a meeting on Feb. 18, Mrs. Hills and Yeutter agreed to look
for a way to certify as hormone-free as much U.S. beef as possible.
   At the time, the United States indicated it would reduce its
$100 million in punitive tariffs by the amount of U.S. beef Europe
was willing to accept.
   The agreement Wednesday follows the recommendations of a task
force of officials from both sides established to study the matter.
The partial resolution will cover high quality grades of beef being
shipped to Europe but will not cover the other 85 percent of beef
trade which includes so-called ``variety meats'' such as livers,
tongues and kidneys.
   Mrs. Hills said that the task force studying the situation will
continue searching for ways to include more American beef and will
report back before June 15.
   In a statement, Mrs. Hills called the interim agreement a
``positive step'' toward de-escalating what had become a
contentious dispute between America and one of its largest trading
partners.
   ``To the extent that U.S. beef and beef products are shipped to
the European Community under this measure, we will reduce U.S.
retaliatory measures on imports from the EC,'' she said.
   Yeutter said that while the U.S. position remains the same that
American beef containing the hormones presents no health risk, the
administration did not want to ``stand in the way of producers who
are willing and able to meet the EC's requirements'' for
hormone-free beef.
   Under the agreement, American ranchers who want to export
hormone-free beef to Europe will be given a set of requirements
that they will have to meet by European officials, who will also
establish a monitoring system to insure that the beef being shipped
does not contain hormones.

<HEAD>Envoy Says U.S. Likely To Cut WHO Funding If PLO Joins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said
Wednesday the United States probably will cut off funding to the
World Health Organization if it admits the PLO, and would do the
same to any other U.N. agency that admits the PLO.
   Pickering told reporters the Palestine Liberation Organization
should withdraw or postpone its application to join the WHO when it
meets in Geneva next week. He said the United States had been
conducting a vigorous lobbying campaign against the membership.
   ``The United States has made known it is not prepared to fund
WHO under these circumstances (PLO membership) because the PLO is
not, by legal definition, a state,'' Pickering said.
   He said PLO membership would harm the WHO and endanger the
delicate peace process in the Middle East by ``polarizing'' the
situation.
   Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the State
Department would recommend to Congress that WHO funding be
withdrawn if the organization admits the PLO. Pickering extended
the threat to any other U.N. agency that might admit the PLO.
   No other U.N. agencies have indicated they are considering
admitting the PLO as a member.
   The United States donates one quarter of the annual WHO budget,
or approximately $75 million.
   Zuhdi Labib Terzi, the PLO's permanent U.N. observer, said he
had no immediate comment on Pickering's statement about other U.N.
agencies. Earlier, however, he said the PLO would press ahead with
efforts to join the WHO despite U.S. threats.
   To be admitted to the 166-member WHO, the PLO needs a simple
majority vote when the agency meets May 8. Admission would enhance
the PLO's credibility and prestige in the international community.
   ``There is anguish that this is ill-timed,'' Pickering, a former
ambassador to Israel, told reporters. ``This is a wrong and
ill-conceived notion and it is time to try to find a formula or a
way to postpone this.''
   He said the United States would not object if the WHO
established a group to study the question.
   Although the United States decided last year to establish a
dialogue with the PLO, it does not recognize the self-declared
Palestinian state in Israel's occupied territories.
   Pickering said that even some key Arab states do not support PLO
membership because the PLO does not satisfy the traditional
definition of statehood.
   He conceded that a halt to U.S. funding could harm worthy WHO
programs, like those on AIDS and nutrition. But he said there would
be discussions on how the United States could continue to spend the
funds effectively.

   To the British public, Winston Silcott is the
leader of a mob that hacked a policeman to death in a north London
riot.
   But to some students at the world-renowned London School of
Economics, his conviction and life sentence are an injustice. By
making Silcott the honorary president of their student union, they
have provoked a furious response from the government as well as
fellow students.
   ``People who come here are supposed to be intelligent. If that
is so, how can they elect this lunatic?'' asked Daniel Kasmir, a
20-year-old social sciences freshman, between classes at the
central London campus on Wednesday. ``It gives the college a bad
name.''
   In Parliament, Education Secretary Kenneth Baker branded
Silcott's election ``shameful and despicable'' and told Parliament:
``This is the loony left hijacking a great institution.''
   But Mike Cronshaw, 23, a post-graduate in economics, said the
union had achieved its aim: to refocus attention on the validity of
the convictions of 49 young men after bloody rioting in the
racially mixed Tottenham district on Oct. 16, 1985, in which a
white policeman was killed.
   ``If we do believe in British standards of justice, the
beyond-reasonable-doubt criterion, then if it is not seen to be
applied by normal standards, there is grounds for a retrial,''
Cronshaw said.
   About 100 left-wing students elected 29-year-old Silcott to the
one-year ceremonial term at the union's sparsely attended Annual
General Meeting Thursday. A bigger turnout tried to reverse the
decision at an angry meeting Tuesday but failed by 26 votes to
achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.
   The National Union of Students announced Wednesday it will hold
a secret ballot of the college's 4,000 students.
   College governors pledged to review the college union's funding,
while the school's Afro-Caribbean Society denounced the vote as
``deplorable, insensitive and patronizing to the black race.''
   Silcott and another black, along with a Turkish teen-ager, were
convicted of murdering Keith Blakelock with machetes, and 43 out of
69 others were convicted and jailed for riot and affray.
   More than 500 youths fought battles with police in and around
the Broadwater Farm housing project in the worst of a wave of
racial unrest in British cities in the fall of 1985. It was the
first riot to claim a policeman's life.
   Shaun Waterman, 24, a spokesman for the Broadwater Farm Defense
Campaign, says the hunt for the killers turned into ``basically a
lucky dip, a lottery.''
   ``The police needed scapegoats, they wanted revenge for the
killing of one of their colleagues,'' he claimed in an interview.
   Civil libertarians have also cast doubt on the fairness of the
trials. Amnesty International, the human rights group, investigated
the case and concluded that the police forced many suspects to sign
confessions and denied them full access to lawyers.
   It said confessions formed the basis of the prosecution evidence
against nearly all defendants charged with felonies.
   While in custody, Silcott denied involvement in the killing and
refused to answer most police questions. Police alleged that in his
final interview, he told an officer, ``You ain't got enough
evidence. Those kids won't give evidence in court. No one will talk
to you. You can't keep me away from them.'' Silcott denied using
those words.
   Silcott's defenders say police also presented conflicting
testimony about his whereabouts during the riot.
   In 1987 a jury found Silcott guilty, and Judge Sir Derek Hodgson
sentenced him to a minimum 30 years in prison, calling him ``a very
evil and a very dangerous man.''
   The judge disclosed that Silcott already was out on bail for
another murder when the riot broke out.
   Lord Gifford, a civil rights campaigner and former judge,
condemned the trials as ``a blot on the reputation of British
justice.'' In a report, he concluded that ``the whole process from
first to last was arbitrary, unfair and not conducive to bringing
guilty people to justice.''
   Gifford told students Tuesday that there was no evidence to
convict Silcott. ``It was a terrible crime, and the more terrible a
crime the greater is the emotion and the danger of prejudice,
particularly racial prejudice.''

<HEAD>Dole Raises $1.2 Million To Benefit Disabled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and his wife Barbara made a
surprise visit Wednesday evening at a fund-raising event that
collected some $1.2 million for a foundation headed by Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole.
   The Dole foundation assists the disabled and particularly
promotes employment of the disabled. It is headed by the Kansas
senator who was Bush's rival for the Republican presidential
nomination last year.
   In brief remarks, Bush praised the organization's work and its
help in ``mainstreaming'' the disadvantaged.
   He said the organization was ``a shining example for all of
us,'' and called in ``one of the many thousands of points of
light,'' a phrase he uses to refer to private activities that help
make society better.
   The foundation also announced the awarding of $240,000 in grants
for training and job programs for the disabled.
   The announcement came at the foundation's fourth annual
$1,000-a-person reception.
   ``We have helped provide training and placement to over 2,200
people with disabilities in the past three years and we are just
getting started,'' Dole said in a statement.
   The foundation honored the Marriott Corp. for what Dole
described as ``outstanding achievements in hiring people with
disabilities at all levels throughout the company.'' The company
employs more than 6,000 disabled people.
   Dole, who lost most of the use of his right arm and hand because
of wounds in World War II, established the non-profit,
non-political foundation to provide money for training and job
programs for the disabled. It began operating in 1984 and has
provided grants totaling $2.7 million to more than 100 programs in
30 states.

   The man who was skipper of the tanker
Exxon Valdez when it struck a reef and caused the nation's largest
oil spill pleaded innocent Wednesday to criminal charges, including
operating the vessel while drunk.
   Joseph Hazelwood, 42, entered the plea through his attorney in a
15-minute proceeding before state Judge David Stewart. Hazelwood,
who was silent and declined to answer reporters' questions, was
ushered out a back door of the courtroom immediately after the
hearing.
   Hazelwood, who was fired by Exxon after the accident, is charged
with operating a vessel while drunk, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of oil, stemming from the March 24 incident
which dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince
William Sound.
   His attorney presented a $50,000 check for bail after Stewart
rejected a request to lower the amount to $25,000.
   Stewart scheduled the trial for June 20 in Valdez, but one of
Hazelwood's lawyers, Dan Dennis, said he would seek to transfer the
trial to another area. ``There will undoubtedly be a change of
venue (request),'' Dennis said.
   Stewart also said a grand jury has launched an investigation to
determine whether additional charges should be filed against
Hazelwood. He did not elaborate.
   The state, meanwhile, was under pressure from the federal
government to respond to Exxon's controversial plan for cleaning up
oil-fouled seashore.
   State authorities reported increasing damage on the Alaska
Peninsula and at Katmai National Park.
   ``It's a very thick mousse-type stuff six to eight inches
thick'' hitting in blotches, said Bill Lamoreaux, a state
environmental official. ``It's definitely a difficult type of
clean-up operation. It's close to shore and rolling up on shore.''
   Federal Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner was to inspect
the spill zone, and Vice President Dan Quayle scheduled a visit
Thursday on his return from Asia.
   After the spill, Hazelwood went home to Huntington, N.Y., where
he was arrested on a fugitive warrant, but he returned voluntarily
Wednesday and surrendered, not even waiting for an extradition
hearing. He had been free on $25,000 bail in New York and a
prosecutor said Wednesday he would move to dismiss the fugitive
charge and return the bail money.
   On the night of the spill, Hazelwood allegedly turned over
control of the 987-foot-long Exxon Valdez to an uncertified mate.
The tanker was outside shipping lanes when it rammed a reef and
ripped its bottom, letting the Alaskan North Slope crude oil pour
out.
   Authorities say Hazelwood, who has a history of alcohol-related
driving arrests in New York, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.061
percent nine hours after the crash. The legal maritime limit for
operating a vessel is 0.04 percent.
   State environmental officials, facing a deadline ordered by
President Bush's personal emissary to the oil spill, worked to
decide whether to accept Exxon's plan to remove the crude from
hundreds of miles of shoreline.
   Key state scientists and the head of Alaska's Department of
Environmental Conservation have sharply criticized the oil
company's proposal, which would leave nearly 200 miles of oily
coastline uncleansed and require exemptions from strict
environmental laws to dispose of the sludge and wastewater.
   Lamoreaux described the plan Wednesday as ``more like a briefing
document for the press than a plan for us.''
   Dennis Kelso, Alaska's environmental conservation commissioner,
called Exxon's cleanup and disposal plan ``a few pages of wishful
thinking.''
   A statement issued by Kelso's office said state authorities
would ``insist that Exxon focus all its energies and equipment on
cleaning all the affected beaches, no matter how hard hit.''
   Admiral Paul A. Yost Jr., commandant of the Coast Guard, ordered
state authorities to issue a formal response to Exxon's plan. Yost
must approve the proposal before it is put into effect and said he
would do so within a week.
   Yost also has criticized the proposal, saying it was poorly
drafted and lacked specifics, but he stopped short of formally
rejecting it.
   In an interview Wednesday on ``CBS This Morning,'' Gov. Steve
Cowper said the state may be willing to waive some environmental
restrictions for disposal of the oil if ``that's the only practical
way to get rid of it and it doesn't really cause anything but
temporary changes in the air quality, we might well consider that.''
   Exxon has proposed several methods to dispose of oil wastes.
Salvageable oil would be processed and refined. Oil-laced water
would be sent to a Valdez water-treatment plant that cleans ballast
water from oil tankers. Solid oil wastes would be burned or buried.

<TEXT>
   The Central Park beating and rape of a
28-year-old investment banker grabbed headlines two weeks ago and
hasn't let go, provoking debates about how racism, sexism and class
division may have led to the attack and influenced the coverage.
   From Harlem, where the teen-age suspects lived, to Wall Street,
where the victim worked, the questions continue:
   Did the black and Hispanic youths attack her because she is
white? Is the story played up because of the black-white angle?
Would the rape of a black investment banker get the same attention?
   ``The only reason for all this (publicity) is because she's
white,'' said a black girl from an East Harlem junior high that two
of the suspects attended. ``If she was a black girl or a Hispanic
girl, nobody would care, and that happens all the time.''
   ``I don't think the incident itself was racial,'' said the Rev.
Herbert Daughtry, a civil rights activist, ``but I think the way
that we _ the media, the police, all of us _ have reacted is
racial.''
   Whether racism motivated the attackers is something that may not
be known until the trials of the six indicted youths, if then.
   ``We have never classified it as a bias case or a racially
motivated incident,'' said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the
district attorney's office.
   Meanwhile, the victim has emerged from her two-week coma, spoken
to relatives and expressed a desire to resume running, doctors said
Wednesday.
   The woman began responding Tuesday and had spoken in a whisper
to relatives and staff members, raised two fingers when asked to do
so and was able to read large signs printed with yes, no and her
name, said Robert S. Kurtz, assistant chief of surgery at
Metropolitan Hospital, and Kent Duffy, chief of neurosurgery.
   However, Kurtz said, ``We would still say ... she is in a
delirium. People in this stage will fluctuate.'' He has said it is
unlikely she will ever fully recover.
   The teen-agers who went ``wilding'' through the park April 19
attacked nine white and Hispanic joggers, bicyclists and one
homeless man. What turned the spree of petty crime into brutal
violence remains a mystery, though many have theories.
   Lisa Whitten, a black psychologist, said crossing that line was
made easier because violence is commonplace in Harlem and made
mundane by repetitive violent images in the media.
   The generally degrading image of women in movies, television and
pornography, she said, serves as an anesthetic that would deaden
the sense of revulsion most people would feel toward such violence.
   ``They had fantasies in their minds _ of being like those on
television, the ones who shoot people, who are powerful, in
control, macho, aggressive, strong,'' she said.
   Also contributing, some say, is the contrast between the poorer
sections of Manhattan and the wealthier ones, which coexist nearly
side-by-side along the upper reaches of Central Park.
   ``From where these kids live, in five minutes walking you're in
the gold coast, people are millionaires,'' said Howard Diller, a
lawyer for one of the suspects. ``Was there any resentment,
jealousy, hate, anger that was involved?''
   Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins, a black who is
running for mayor, met with more than 100 community, religious and
political leaders Friday to deal with lingering tensions.
   ``I want to avoid a situation wherein any young
African-American, any young Latino will be seen as threatening by
others who happen to be white,'' Dinkins said.
   Dinkins called the attackers ``urban terrorists,'' but noted,
``African-American women who have been savaged did not get the
attention that this has.''
   Diller, who has discussed the case on national television and
radio programs, said the victim's ``very upwardly mobile'' career
gives the story added interest for those who might otherwise ignore
a rape.
   WCBS-TV assistant news director Steve Paulus said he believed
the crime initially drew attention because it occurred in Central
Park, where people are warned not to go after dark.
   ``The morning we came in, we didn't know the victim was an
investment banker,'' he said. ``We didn't know she was a yuppie.''
   Donald Forst, New York editor of New York Newsday, said there
were newsroom discussions about the amount of attention given the
attack, but he believed it was ``appropriate to the event.''
   WNBC-TV news director Terry Baker said he thought, ``if you keep
all the other circumstances the same and change the race of the
victim,'' the coverage would have been ``pretty much the same.''
   ``Yes, there are assaults all the time, rapes all the time, but
something with this degree of viciousness, involving this many
young kids, allegedly, it leads you to wonder what's happening to
your society,'' he said.
   ``It's the kind of story that has an entire city talking,'' said
Daily News Managing Editor James Willse. ``The conflict is one of
culture, class, more than it is of race.''
   John Darnton, metropolitan editor of The New York Times, was out
of the office Wednesday, and a spokeswoman did not return two phone
messages.
   New York Post editor Jane Amsterdam and metropolitan editor Dick
Belsky also were not immediately available.
   On Monday, there was a gathering in the park at which children
tried to do some repair work on their image.
   ``The media builds it up that all black and Hispanic kids commit
these horrible crimes,'' said 12-year-old William Flores. ``We know
we are not like this, thank you.''

<HEAD>Pravda Says More Than 100 Arrested in Riot in Turkmenia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pravda reported Wednesday that police arrested
about half of a mob of about 200 young people who attacked stores,
restaurants and parks in the republic of Turkmenia in Central Asia
after May Day celebrations.
   The Communist Party newspaper charged that the crowd in
Ashkabad, the capital of Turkmenia, was led by criminals and said
it was broken up by force on Monday evening after ignoring calls by
police to disperse.
   ``Not less than 100 lawbreakers were detained, and no one was
hurt,'' Pravda said.
   The newspaper said, ``Those who were detained said they acted
because of exorbitant prices of cooperatives and the low quality of
products and services. But as a method of protest, as was seen,
they chose hooliganism.''
   It said the rioters broke windows and damaged cars.
   Pravda quoted Interior Minister Vasily Grinin of Turkmenia as
saying police managed to break up the rampage without using tear
gas or truncheons.
   This apparently was intended to assure readers that no repeat
had occurred of the clash between soldiers and pro-independence
demonstrators in the Georgian republic on April 9. Nineteen people
were killed then and a 20th victim was fatally shot later for
violating a curfew.
   Turkmenia is a southern Soviet republic of 3.5 million people
that borders the Caspian Sea, Iran and Afghanistan. It was the
first such report of trouble in Turkmenia, but religious and civil
unrest were reported previously in the other traditionally Moslem
Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.
   Cooperatives are small, privately owned businesses allowed under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms to provide goods
and services the state-run economy cannot. Many Soviets view the
cooperatives with suspicion.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 8th graf to correct 1988 to 1987 and clarify 1982 figure.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Spending on education is up but progress is at
a standstill, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said Wednesday in
releasing a report card that rates the nation's students as
``merely average.''
   ``The good news is that the schools are not worse; the bad news
is that we are not making progress,'' Cavazos said as he stood
before his department's sixth annual State Education Performance
Chart.
   ``We are standing still, and the problem is that it's been this
way for three years in a row. Frankly, the situation scares me,''
he said.
   The figures show a decline this year in the national high school
graduation rate and falling scores on college entrance exams in
half the states.
   In reaction, the Council of Chief State School Officers, while
acknowledging that ``the task ahead is gigantic,'' noted that 44 of
the 50 states have made college entrance test gains since 1982 and
38 states have improved their high school completion rates since
then.
   But Cavazos called the longer-term gains minimal. He said
``scores on college entrance exams are still substantially lower
than they were in the 1960s'' while the graduation rate has gone up
less than two points.
   ``As a nation our educational performance is merely average,''
Cavazos said. ``People are still willing, apparently, to accept
that we're not doing well and can't compete.''
   If educational progress has stagnated, the Education
Department's chart shows the same cannot be said of per-pupil
spending. The national average was $3,977 per student in 1987, up
from $3,165 in 1982, calculated in constant dollars _ a 26 percent
hike.
   ``We are already spending more money per student than our major
foreign competitors, Japan and Germany. And yet our students
consistently fall behind the competition in competitive testing,''
Cavazos said. ``Money alone is not the answer to our education
deficit.''
   Cavazos said he would write to state school chiefs, governors
and school board presidents and urge them to adopt specific goals
such as boosting high school graduation rates to 90 percent and
cutting in half the number of children who fail a grade. He said
states and districts should issue annual reports on their progress
toward such goals.
   Specifically, the department's chart shows that national scores
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) fell from an average of 906
to 904 (on a scale of 400 to 1,600) from 1987 to 1988. Fourteen of
the 22 states in which the SAT is the dominant college entrance
exam registered declines.
   Scores on the American College Testing Program (ACT), marked on
a scale of 1 to 36, showed a scant 0.1-point gain. And 11 of the 28
states in which the ACT dominates posted decreases.
   The high school graduation rate rose from 69.5 percent in 1982
to 71.7 percent in 1985. But it edged down in 1986 to 71.6 percent
and dropped to 71.1 percent in 1987, the latest year for which such
statistics could be calculated.
   Department officials noted several encouraging trends: Minority
students are continuing to lift their test scores, close a high
school ``graduation gap'' and in increasing numbers take the
Advanced Placement test that qualifies students for college credit.
   In addition, states with relatively high poverty rates such as
Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina have registered some of the
largest increases in college entrance test scores since 1982,
though they still rank at the bottom of the heap.
   Cavazos' generally dismal assessment comes amid a spate of
reform efforts in the past few years. Asked if the reform movement
has failed, he replied that ``some of it has lost its momentum'' or
failed to achieve its goals.
   He said fundamental restructuring _ which he defined as parental
freedom to choose public schools, provision of alternate ways to
become a teacher and more parental involvement in education _ has
yet to occur. ``We have some examples but we don't have a lot of
them out there,'' he said.
   In a telephone interview, California schools superintendent Bill
Honig accused Cavazos of misrepresenting data, ignoring progress
and flinging cold water on educators who have been able to improve
their students' performance.
   ``We've got statistics showing that achievement test scores are
going up substantially in the country,'' Honig said, calling them a
better indicator than college entrance tests because they include
average students as well as the college-bound.
   Honig also said SAT scores are flat because so many more
students are taking the test. He said there has actually been a
substantial improvement in the percentage of seniors scoring higher
than 450 on the verbal section and 500 on the math section _ a 20
percent increase since 1982.
   The National Education Association issued a statement saying it
agreed that U.S. schools are stagnating. But the teacher union said
Cavazos is wrong to minimize money as a factor for improvement, and
it attributed the stagnation problem to federal cutbacks in
programs for the disadvantaged. ``What we are seeing now is the
direct result of the educational neglect supported by the Reagan
administration,'' said NEA president Mary Futrell.

   The military government lifted a
5-year-old ban on political parties on Wednesday and proclaimed a
new constitution, one of several steps being taken toward civilian
rule in 1992.
   The decision was announced in a nationwide television and radio
broadcast by Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, the head of state.
   On May 9, Babangida begins a four-day official visit to Britain,
which administered Nigeria until the country's independence in 1960.
   There already has been some clandestine regrouping of political
organizations in expectation of the new move, and they were
expected to come out in the open on Thursday.
   Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, with an estimated
population of 95 million, and it is an important oil producer.
   It has undergone a string of military coups since the first in
1966. The last civilian government under President Shehu Shagari
was overthrown by the army on Dec. 31, 1983, when partisan politics
were banned.
   Under a transition program announced Wednesday night, some
civilian leaders will be elected in local council polls in
December. Elections of legislators and governors for the 21 states
will be held next year.
   The military stated on Tuesday that it would not lay down any
ideology for civilian rule.

   A man accused of killing his two sons by
locking them into a searing foundry ladle was a mentally ill
religious zealot who spoke of ``trial by fire,'' his attorney said
Wednesday.
   Bartley James Dobbens, 28, is on trial in circuit court on two
counts of murder in the Thanksgiving Day 1987 deaths of 2-year-old
Bartley Joel and 15-month-old Peter David Dobben in nearby Norton
Shores.
   The defendant, who has been diagnosed as a paranoid
schizophrenic, wept during opening arguments when his wife and
children were mentioned.
   Dobben's pregnant wife was waiting for him in their car when he
took the boys into the Cannon-Muskegon Corp. foundry to retrieve a
Bible and show them where he worked.
   In his opening argument, defense attorney Terry Nolan told
jurors he would show Dobben was legally insane at the time.
   Assistant Muskegon County Prosecutor Brett Gardner said the
evidence would show Dobben planned his children's deaths because of
jealousy and ``a bad marriage that existed from the start.''
   Nolan said Dobben stopped taking psychiatric medication and
filed for divorce within two weeks of meeting self-ordained
minister Rood Vaughan in March 1987.
   ``Within two weeks, Bartley Dobben's life turned upside down,''
the attorney said.
   Dobben began taking his children to hear fundamentalist
Christian sermons by Vaughan in the basement of Vaughan's home, and
sometimes kept the children out all night, Nolan said.
   On the day of the slaying, Dobben visited a friend at 1 a.m. and
talked for hours, quoting from the Bible and speaking of ``trial by
fire ... and only fire burns sins away,'' Nolan said.
   Dobben thought he was performing ``a spiritual rite'' when he
took his children to the foundry, put them in a furnace, ``played
with them to make them comfortable,'' lit the gas jets, and set
them at 1,300 degrees, Nolan said.
   The attorney said Dobben's schizophrenia first appeared in high
school, when he appeared to undergo a ``Jekyll and Hyde
transition'' and became obsessed with religion.
   After marrying, Dobben became insanely jealous and later became
obsessed with the idea his children would be killed, Nolan said.
   In 1985, Dobben had psychotic episodes so intense he was
committed to a psychiatric hospital, and endured co-workers' taunts
after his release, Nolan said.
   Nolan is charged with open counts of murder, meaning the jury
sets the degree. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in
prison.
   The trial is expected to last two to four weeks.

   In an unusual send-off, NBC's ``Family Ties''
will conclude its television run with a 70-minute episode capped by
a round of emotional curtain calls, the network announced Wednesday.
   The final ``Family Ties'' broadcast on May 14 was set for a
special one-hour length, but NBC told the show's producers they
could include an additional seven minutes of dialogue and three
minutes of spontaneous farewells by cast and crew members.
   The rest of the NBC lineup that night will be delayed 10
minutes, the network said.
   ``Family Ties'' came to the NBC schedule in 1982 and was
partially responsible for the network's climb out of the ratings
cellar. In the situation comedy's final episode, Alex Keaton
(Michael J. Fox) leaves his parents, sisters and brother for a job
on Wall Street.

   The right-wing military government said
Wednesday it was scrapping plans for democratic reforms because the
opposition rejected a take-it-or-leave-it proposal.
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres blamed ``intransigent''
opposition leaders in announcing an end to further talks. He said
the opposition ``closed out the possibility of a realistic
agreement'' on amendments to the 1980 constitution.
   ``Under the current circumstances, there is no possibility
whatsoever of talking again about constitutional changes,'' he told
a news conference.
   Among reform proposals abandoned was one legalizing Marxism.
   The announcement indicated an abrupt hardening in the position
of President Augusto Pinochet's government and a return to an
openly antagonistic relationship between authorities and opposition.
   Patricio Aylwin, president of the centrist Christian Democratic
Party and a leader of a 17-party opposition coalition, told his own
news conference later that the move means reforms will have to wait
until after Dec. 14 elections.
   ``If the government has said it will make no changes at all,
there will be no changes for the time being,'' he said. ``They will
have to be done by the future congress and the future government to
be elected in December.''
   Aylwin is considered the coalition's most likely choice as
presidential candidate.
   The government on Friday proposed 19 changes to the
constitution, including several offered in response to pressures
for reform after Gen. Pinochet lost a referendum last October on
extending his rule to 1997. Some changes deemed essential by the
opposition were left out, however.
   The referendum loss obliged Pinochet to schedule the elections,
and his foes say reforms are needed to make sure the new government
has full democratic powers. Pinochet is legally barred from being a
candidate.
   The government package would have required approval by two
successive senates before the reforms took effect _ a delay of at
least five years.
   The opposition coalition rejected it on Tuesday night as ``a
step backward.'' It wanted the reforms to take effect before the
elections, the first since Pinochet seized power in a violent 1973
coup.
   The government proposal met an opposition call for amending a
constitutional article that outlaws all propagation of Marxist
thought, by individuals or groups. It would retain a ban on
political groups that promote violence or totalitarianism.
   It also allowed for a one-time shortening of the presidential
term to four years instead of the normal eight years. The
opposition wanted the shorter term for the next government, which
it sees as a transition leadership.
   But the government refused to meet an opposition demand that the
entire senate be elected. According to the constitution, 10 members
of the senate's 36 members will be appointed.
   It also rejected opposition calls for erasing a clause that
allows Pinochet to remain as army commander for eight more years.
The same clause applies to the heads of the navy, air force and
national police.
   The 73-year-old Pinochet recently vowed to stay on as army
commander and said the military would keep a role as political
overseers to ensure the country does not fall under leftist control.

   Newly elected parliament members from Moscow
decided Wednesday it would be frivolous to nominate anyone but
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for president of the Soviet Union, a
participant in the meeting said.
   ``We decided the president must be Gorbachev and we will not put
forward an alternative,'' said Mikhail Bocharov, who was elected
from the Butovo district on Moscow's outskirts.
   Leonid Kravchenko, director of the official news agency Tass,
said last week in London the Moscow deputies planned to nominate a
candidate to compete with Gorbachev for the presidenccy, but
Bocharov said it was a ``silly'' idea.
   Gorbachev, who has been Communist Party chief since March 1985,
was elected president unanimously in October by the Supreme Soviet,
replacing Andrei A. Gromyko.
   Political reforms since then change the way the president is
chosen and expand the powers of the office. The new 2,250-member
Congress of People's Deputies will convene May 25 to elect the
president and choose a 542-member working parliament from among its
own members.
   Tass said Gorbachev addressed Wednesday's meeting of Moscow
members, but it did not report what he said. Bocharov said the
Soviet leader answered questions put by some of the 70 to 80
representatives present.
   Others attending included Lev N. Zaikov, the Moscow party chief;
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, and party ideologist Vadim A. Medvedev,
Tass reported.
   Bocharov, who runs a building materials factory, said the Moscow
group would meet again May 15 to chose candidates for the working
parliament.
   In another political development, Soviet political activists
said they had formed a branch of the Rome-based Radical Party.
   Alexander Rubchenko, spokesman for the newly formed 70-member
Transnational Radical Party, said the group would campaign for the
elimination of nuclear weapons, more political freedom and
protection of the environment.
   Rubchenko, a political activist, said the new group also was
seeking more economic ties with Western Europe, the lifting of
customs barriers and acceptance of a common European system of laws.
   Soviet law prohibits any political party except the Communist
Party, and the effort to register as an affiliate of the Italian
party apparently was designed to get around that prohibition.

<HEAD>Canada Opens New $76 Million Embassy Facing Capitol Hill</HEAD>

   Snipping a royal blue ribbon, Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney on Wednesday formally opened his country's
new, $76 million embassy near the foot of Capitol Hill and declared
that ``the maple leaf comes to Pennsylvania Avenue.''
   Mulroney, who arrived for talks Thursday with President Bush,
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III paid tribute to the close
ties between the United States and Canada, symbolized by the unique
location of the new chancery building.
   It is the only foreign embassy situated on Pennsylvania Avenue,
the ceremonial route lining the Capitol and the White House. The
modernistic building, designed by Vancouver architect Arthur
Erickson, occupies a prized, 1.2-acre site opposite the National
Gallery of Art.
   A smiling Baker held the ribbon draped across the main entrance
to the building while Mulroney clipped it with a pair of scissors
before a crowd of dignitaries that included leading members of
Congress, Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun and CIA Director
William Webster.
   Baker said the new embassy ``conveys the warmth and openness of
the people of Canada'' and reflects enduring bonds of friendship
between the two countries.
   Mulroney declared the embassy ``open in the service of Canada
and in service of the friendship of our great ally, the United
States of America.''
   Together, they visited Ambassador Derek Burney's glassed-in
penthouse office suite on the sixth floor to admire the view of the
Mall and the Capitol.
   The embassy staff of 327 people moved into the building a month
ago from their previous quarters in two buildings on Massachusetts
Avenue, the city's traditional ``embassy row,'' and rented space in
a downtown office building.
   Burney, who arrived shortly before Bush was inaugurated Jan. 20,
will continue to reside in an elegant, six-story mansion on
Massachusetts Avenue where Canada's envoys had maintained their
offices since 1928.
   The new embassy building, finished in Ontario limestone with
unpolished aluminum pillars, was completed in March, a year behind
schedule, at a cost of $76 million, nearly double the original
estimate.
   The courtyard outside the main entrance features a pool,
terraced greenery and a fountain under a rotunda circled by 12
columns, one for each of Canada's 10 provinces and two territories.
Inside are a 20,000-volume library, a 175-seat theater, a small
exercise room and an art gallery.

<TEXT>
   More than 100,000 opposition backers
packed one of the capital's main streets Wednesday to hear
candidates predict victory in next week's elections and an end to
21 years of military control.
   Presidential candidate Guillermo Endara, his voice hoarse, told
the crowd Panama was on the eve of ``a new republic of which you
all will be founding fathers.''
   ``I was born free. I am not free. I will be free on May 7,''
shouted Guillermo Ford, the opposition's candidate for the second
of two vice-presidential seats in Sunday's balloting.
   The speeches were interrupted when crowds panicked, once when
security guards stopped people from coming too near the candidates
and again when an alleged government infiltrator, or ``toad,'' was
chased from the area by a mob beating him with sticks. People in
the crowd said they saw an unidentified man fire gunshots into the
air at one point.
   Several people were knocked to the ground. Some fainted and were
carried away, but no serious injuries were reported.
   A group of youths snake-danced through the crowd carrying a
black coffin with the picture of a smiling Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega pasted on the front and a pineapple affixed on top.
``Pineapple face'' is a derogatory name for Noriega, inspired by
his rough complexion.
   First vice-presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon praised
young Panamanians at the rally, saying, ``There are thousands here
who have never known liberty but are here to fight for it.''
   The chanting, flag-waving crowd was packed so tightly on Via
Espana that at times it was impossible to move.
   The opposition has accused the government of trying to rig
Sunday's election. Earlier Wednesday, opposition leaders warned
that Panamanians may react with violence if fraud is evident.
   ``This is the last peaceful opportunity for change,'' Ford told
a news conference earlier in the day. Endara and Arias also
attended the conference.
   Ford said the opposition wants to avoid a confrontation with the
Defense Forces, but ``we fear that if the will of the people is
violated, there will be a spontaneous reaction.''
   Noriega, head of the Defense Forces and Panama's de facto ruler,
is backing his business associate, Carlos Duque Jaen, for president.
   The government also has warned that the elections could turn
violent. Duque has urged his followers ``to take to the streets ...
to defend the vote.''
   The government made a public show of handing out weapons April
30 to the ``Dignity Batallions,'' civilians trained to defend
Panama against a U.S. invasion.
   Arias said official voter rolls show duplicated names and
suspicious increases in the number of voters. He said the
registration in some districts doubled.
   He alleged the number of registered voters on rolls has grown 29
percent since 1984, while the population has increased by only 16
percent.
   Government officials explained the increases by saying
registration procedures have improved.
   Despite the predictions of fraud, Arias said he was confident
the opposition's ``margin of victory will be such that it will
neutralize the fraud, if the fraud is not accompanied by crude
forms of repression.''
   The opposition candidates said there is no hope of democracy in
Panama as long as Noriega, who was indicted in the United States
last year on charges of drug smuggling and money laundering,
remains in power.
   After his indictment, then-President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried
to oust Noriega. Noriega in turn ousted Delvalle.
   Noriega and the government accuse the opposition of being
lackies of the United States, which has imposed economic sanctions
on Panama as part of its attempt to drive him from power.
   Noriega denies the drug smuggling and money laundering
allegations and says the United States is trying to get rid of him
as part of a plan to retain control of the Panama Canal.
   According to a 1977 treaty, the United States is to turn the
waterway over to local control in the year 2000 and remove its
12,000 military personnel from Panama.
   Among the observers expected for Sunday's voting are former
presidents Jimmy Carter, who signed the treaty, and Gerald Ford.
They are part of an unofficial U.S. delegation invited by the
Panamanian government. The government has rejected any official
U.S. delegation.

<HEAD>Three Puppies Born to Red Wolf, Part of Endangered Species</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A red wolf, the second rarest mammal in
the United States, gave birth to three puppies Wednesday at a
wildlife center.
   If the puppies survive, they will be the first Texas-born red
wolves since the mid-1970s, raising the total population to 92,
said officials at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center.
   In 1973, after the passage of the Endangered Species Act, the
entire red wolf population in southeast Texas and Louisiana was
captured to prevent its extinction.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service captured about 40 red wolves
and began a recovery program in Washington state.
   The black-footed ferret is the only mammal that is rarer than
the red wolf in the United States.
   Fossil Rim, a research and education center that is involved in
the propagation of eight endangered species, received four red wolf
breeding pair in February.
   ``We are sure a second female will produce a litter within the
next week to 10 days,'' said Dr. Evan Blumer, a Fossil Rim
veterinarian.
   The puppies were estimated to weigh about 14 ounces, but Fossil
Rim officials said they would not be sexed or examined until
Thursday or Friday.
   The red wolf is smaller than the grey wolf, with females
weighing 40-60 pounds and males weighing 60-80 pounds.
   The wolf ranged from Texas east to the Atlantic coast and north
to the Ohio valley, but began disappearing because of their
inability to adapt to changes in the land and predator control.

   Warring factions agreed Wednesday to
implement a cease-fire plan to end the Beirut bloodbath that has
killed 278 people in eight weeks, an Arab League peacemaker
announced.
   ``There is no justification for a single shot to be fired in
Lebanon as of now,'' Algerian diplomat Lakhdar Ibrahimi told
reporters after meeting separately with Lebanon's rival Cabinet
leaders _ Sunni Moslem Salim Hoss and Christian Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Several hours after Ibrahimi's announcement, however, police
reported a new violation of the truce.
   As speedboats began ferrying passengers from the harbor of the
Christian port of Jounieh to the Cypriot-flagged ferry Baroness M,
anchored 15 miles off the coast, three shells fired from
Syrian-policed west Beirut crashed on the Byblos coast nine miles
north of Jounieh, police said.
   They said the captain of the Baroness M refused to enter the
port, 12 miles north of Beirut, because he was skeptical about
guarantees that his vessel would not be shelled.
   A police spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity
according to regulations, said the violation did not interrupt the
transport of about 500 passengers onto the Baroness M to be ferried
to the Cypriot port of Larnaca.
   The ship and another boat, the Larnaca Rose, had evacuated about
15,000 people from the Christian enclave during the fighting. But
both suspended the shuttles April 24 after they became the target
of Syrian and Druse Moslem gunners.
   Earlier, police reported some sniper fire from Moslem west
Beirut into the Christian sector. But a spokesman played down the
violation and said, ``It seems the cease-fire orders haven't been
issued yet.'' No casualties were reported.
   Aoun's 20,000 Lebanese army soldiers have battled Moslem
militiamen and allied Syrian soldiers since March 3. More than
1,000 people have been injured in that time.
   Ibrahimi and Kuwait's ambassador to Syria, Abdel-Aziz Jassem,
arrived in Beirut earlier Wednesday seeking to enforce an Arab
League-brokered truce that began April 28.
   It scaled down indiscriminate bombardment of population centers
in and around Beirut. But it was violated repeatedly after three
days because Aoun rejected the second clause of the accord,
refusing to lift a blockade of three illegal militia-run ports.
   The blockade, through which Aoun wanted to restore government
authority and gather taxes worth $100 million a year, ignited the
latest fighting.
   Druse and Syrian gunners, who outnumber Christian forces by 3-1,
retaliated by firing at Christian ports, then besieged the
Christian heartland and trapped some 1 million Christians in a
310-square-mile enclave.
   Ibrahimi said Aoun now has ``accepted to implement the decision
adopted by the Arab foreign ministers which calls for lifting all
blockades imposed on all air and sea ports.''
   Beirut airport, the country's only international air transport
facility, was closed by Christian shellfire March 12.
   Ibrahimi said Aoun also agreed to reopen road crossings that
link Beirut's Moslem and Christian sectors for three months while
the Arab League brokers a comprehensive settlement.
   ``I can say the cease-fire has taken effect today after the
settlement of the ports dispute. The observer force will begin
arriving soon,'' Ibrahimi said, but did not give a date.
   An aide to Hoss said Ibrahimi proposed deploying Arab observers
at the disputed ports, where Aoun has charged militias also run
guns and drugs. Aoun agreed to the envoy's compromise.
   Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed, who heads the Arab
League panel on Lebanon, stressed Wednesday that the observers will
be sent only after the cease-fire is consolidated.
   ``We are not prepared to sacrifice any Arab brethren in the
continued shelling and exchange of fire,'' he told the Kuwait News
Agency.
   Aoun has welcomed the deployment of an Arab observer team,
saying it also would monitor the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in Lebanon,
whom Christians accuse of breaking a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   The observers' presence is expected to loosen Syria's grip as
Lebanon's sole powerbroker.

   Two explosions rocked a chemistry lab at
Northwestern University on Wednesday, injuring two graduate
students and setting off a blaze, fire department officials said.
   The incident apparently resulted from experiments under way,
said Northwestern spokesman Mike Tirrell. The victims had been
working with an ether-type solvent, said Pat Tremmel, another
Northwesten spokeswoman.
   William Finch, 30, a post-doctoral student, was in fair to
serious condition at Evanston Hospital with second-degree burns on
his chest, face and groin, along with a fractured wrist and some
injury from glass fragments, Ms. Tremmel said.
   Laurent Brard, 25, another graduate student, was in good
condition with second-degree burns to the face, chest and arms, and
glass fragment injuries, she said.
   The accident occurred at a second-floor lab in the Technological
Institute, recently the site of heated protests over the use of
animals in scientific research.
   Capt. Sam Boddie of the city fire department said he had heard
nothing to suggest the incident was linked to the protests.
   ``We do have explosions there from time to time. In the last
year, we had one for sure,'' he said.
   Ms. Tremmel later disputed reports of an explosion and described
the incident as ``a small fire,'' but Boddie said there was an
explosion, and firefighters at the scene reported a second, smaller
blast.

<HEAD>Eritrean Rebel Leader Urges U.S. To Help End War With Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An African rebel leader urged the United
States on Wednesday to help end the protracted war between the
strategically placed province of Eritrea and the Soviet-backed
government of Ethiopia.
   Isaias Afwerki, Secretary General of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, said he hoped to convey his views to U.S.
officials and lawmakers, although he declined to say whom he would
be meeting.
   State Department officials, who said Afwerki is the most senior
Eritrean rebel leader ever to visit here, also declined to say
whether they would meet with him.
   Afwerki said he did not have any specific initiatives to offer,
but hoped the United States would ``contribute to a lasting
solution'' for the conflict by helping bring the sides to the
negotiating table.
   U.S. policy rejects Eritrea's demands for secession from
Ethiopia, advocating negotiations between the sides to end what has
become, at 27 years, Africa's longest war.
   State Department officials have occasionally met with members of
the EPLF, the largest of several Eritrean groups. The U.S. also
maintains ties with the government of Ethiopian Military Chairman
Mengistu Haile Mariam, although relations have deteriorated since
Ethiopia switched allegiance to the Soviet Union in 1977.
   Afwerki's visit comes at a time when Mengistu, suffering
economic woes and military defeats to the rebels, is also making
overtures to the U.S. administration.
   ``Ethiopia's prospects are bleaker than ever,'' Afwerki
contended at a seminar sponsored by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, an independent think tank. The EPLF, which
is backed by several Arab governments but relies mostly on captured
Soviet weaponry, has claimed significant military victories over
the past year.
   U.S. officials believe the organization controls about 75
percent of Eritrea, which overlooks a key water route to the oil
fields of Saudi Arabia, but that the government retains control of
the province's major ports and cities. Officials here say the
government is also under pressure from its main arms supplier, the
Soviet Union, to end the costly war.
   Afwerki said the Soviet Union, despite claims to the contrary,
continues to arm the Ethiopian government.
   Nonetheless, the EPLF is ``among the first who hope to benefit''
from recent cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in
resolving regional conflicts around the world. Afwerki said such
superpower cooperation, as evidenced by agreements ending the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Cuban occupation of
Angola, has made his organization optimistic about prospects for
negotiations with Ethiopia.
   The EPLF is still holding out for its 1980 proposal to conduct a
referendum that would determine whether Eritrea remains an
autonomous part of Ethiopia or secedes from it altogether, he said.
   The EPLF has in the past proposed third-country mediation to end
the war with Ethiopia but has spurned proposals for Italy or Sudan
to bring the sides together.
   Afwerki rejected claims that his group is Marxist in nature,
calling that a pretext for past ``U.S. indifference,'' and said the
EPLF represented varying economic views and was committed to a free
economy.

   A senator and a House representative waged
verbal war Wednesday over whether a member of Congress is smart
enough to match wits with the Soviet military.
   In the first volley, Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., criticized a
decision by the House Armed Services Committee to hold hearings
with Soviet officials on crafting a U.S. defense budget.
   ``If the Congress can't make decisions on national security
without testimony and advice from Soviet military planners then we
are in more peril than I had envisioned. To use an old wisdom, `we
have indeed met the enemy and it is us,''' said Exon, a member of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Shooting back was Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House
panel, who said Exon apparently ``doesn't believe senators can
handle a public given-and-take with Soviet officials.''
   ``I'm fully confident in the intellectual and political skills
of the members of my committee,'' he said.
   Aspin announced Monday that his panel would hold hearings with
Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev, former chief of the Soviet general staff
and now an adviser to Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev, sometime in
June.
   In addition, the committee's Defense Policy Panel will hold a
hearing May 9 with Soviet officials from the Institute for the USA
and Canada, a Moscow think tank on superpower relations.
   Aspin said putting together a defense budget ``will be hard
enough to do given the deficit. But the problem is compounded by
uncertainty about the Soviet Union.''
   The chairman pointed out that only the executive branch can
negotiate agreements with the Soviets, but a committee ``is in a
better position for expansive given-and-take and exploration of new
ideas.''
   That raised the ire of Exon, who wondered why Congress doesn't
invite Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``to give us expert testimony
on stopping terrorism.''
   ``Gorbymania has struck with a vengenance in the halls of
Congress. We have initiated our own phrase to mimic the Soviets _
`parrotstroika,''' Exon said.
   The Nebraska senator also said Congress should not be a forum
for Soviet propaganda.
   In response, Aspin said that if Exon ``fears that hearing what
the Russians have to say _ and putting them through a grilling on
what they haven't talked about publicly _ amounts to making `the
committee process a forum for Soviet propaganda,' I feel sorry for
him.''
   Exon, in a telephone interview late Wednesday, said he didn't
``need help from Soviet military planners. Les believes the Soviets
are here to be grilled. I expect him to be keenly disappointed.''
   Asked if the criticisms would result in any bad feelings, Exon
said, ``No. Les and I are good friends. We've worked together for a
long time. This is not the first time and it won't be the last.''

government of Ethiopia.
   Isaias Afwerki, Secretary General of the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front, said he hoped to convey his views to U.S.
officials and lawmakers, although he declined to say whom he would
be meeting.
   State Department officials, who said Afwerki is the most senior
Eritrean rebel leader ever to visit here, also declined to say
whether they would meet with him.
   Afwerki said he did not have any specific initiatives to offer,
but hoped the United States would ``contribute to a lasting
solution'' for the conflict by helping bring the sides to the
negotiating table.
   U.S. policy rejects Eritrea's demands for secession from
Ethiopia, advocating negotiations between the sides to end what has
become, at 27 years, Africa's longest war.
   State Department officials have occasionally met with members of
the EPLF, the largest of several Eritrean groups. The U.S. also
maintains ties with the government of Ethiopian Military Chairman
Mengistu Haile Mariam, although relations have deteriorated since
Ethiopia switched allegiance to the Soviet Union in 1977.
   Afwerki's visit comes at a time when Mengistu, suffering
economic woes and military defeats to the rebels, is also making
overtures to the U.S. administration.
   ``Ethiopia's prospects are bleaker than ever,'' Afwerki
contended at a seminar sponsored by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, an independent think tank. The EPLF, which
is backed by several Arab governments but relies mostly on captured
Soviet weaponry, has claimed significant military victories over
the past year.
   U.S. officials believe the organization controls about 75
percent of Eritrea, which overlooks a key water route to the oil
fields of Saudi Arabia, but that the government retains control of
the province's major ports and cities. Officials here say the
government is also under pressure from its main arms supplier, the
Soviet Union, to end the costly war.
   Afwerki said the Soviet Union, despite claims to the contrary,
continues to arm the Ethiopian government.
   Nonetheless, the EPLF is ``among the first who hope to benefit''
from recent cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in
resolving regional conflicts around the world. Afwerki said such
superpower cooperation, as evidenced by agreements ending the
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the Cuban occupation of
Angola, has made his organization optimistic about prospects for
negotiations with Ethiopia.
   The EPLF is still holding out for its 1980 proposal to conduct a
referendum that would determine whether Eritrea remains an
autonomous part of Ethiopia or secedes from it altogether, he said.
   The EPLF has in the past proposed third-country mediation to end
the war with Ethiopia but has spurned proposals for Italy or Sudan
to bring the sides together.
   Afwerki rejected claims that his group is Marxist in nature,
calling that a pretext for past ``U.S. indifference,'' and said the
EPLF represented varying economic views and was committed to a free
economy.

<HEAD>Rector of Paris Mosque Dies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheik Abbas Ben Sheik El Hocine, rector of the
Great Mosque of Paris and considered the top Moslem religious
authority in France, died Wednesday night after suffering a heart
attack, officials said. He was 77.
   Abbas was evacuated by helicopter Wednesday evening from the
Hotel Crillon, where visiting PLO chief Yasser Arafat is staying,
to the Val de Grace military hospital after the heart attack.
   A statement issued by the mosque said Abbas died at 10:30 p.m.,
shortly after being admitted to the hospital.
   It said the rector's body would be returned to his homeland,
Algeria, on Friday.
   Abbas was made rector of the Paris mosque in 1982. He often
acted as a spokesman for French Moslems, a role disputed by some,
and as a liaison between the French government and the Moslem
community.
   As many as 3 million Moslems live in France, making it the
nation's second religion after Roman Catholicism.
   It was not immediately known whether Abbas had met with Arafat
at the Crillon. The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman was
attending a dinner given by Premier Michel Rocard at the close of a
two-day official visit.
   Abbas, with his tinted spectacles and astrakhan hat, was a
well-known figure to the French media, appearing in occasional
television interviews and commenting on political developments
affecting the Moslem community.
   He became for many a soothing and fatherly symbol of a moderate
Islam. At the height of the scandal of Salman Rushdie's ``The
Satanic Verses,'' Abbas advised the French not to pay so much
attention to this ``disrespectful writer.''
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a death
sentence on Rushdie, saying he had blasphemed Islam in his book.
   Abbas neither spoke nor understood French when he succeeded Si
Hamza Boubakeur, who for years was a powerful but controversial
figure at the head of the mosque in the Latin Quarter on the Left
Bank.
   From a notable religious family near Constantine, Algeria, Abbas
was educated in North African centers of Islamic learning such as
Kerouan, Tunisia, and Fez, Morocco.
   He worked for religious reform in French colonial Algeria to
help return the North African land to its Arab and Islamic
character. Following Algerian independence, he spent four years as
president of the Supreme Islamic Council.
   As rector of the Paris Mosque, his human qualities soon won him
respect from Algerian Moslems, who make up the largest part of the
French Moslem community. He took to opening the doors of the mosque
in winter to provide shelter for the homeless.
   The mosque, inaugurated in 1926, is the largest place of Moslem
worship in Western Europe.

<HEAD>Warhol's Red Marilyn Sells For $4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andy Warhol's portrait, ``Red Marilyn,'' a 1964
depiction of Marilyn Monroe, brought $4 million at auction
Wednesday, a record for a work by the artist.
   The previous high for a Warhol painting was $3.9 million, said
Gloria Harris, a spokeswoman for Christie's. That painting sold
last year, also of the late actress, depicted her face 20 times and
is called ``Marilyn Monroe (Twenty Times).''
   ``Red Marilyn'' had a presale estimate value of between $1.5
million and $2 million. The actual selling price was $4,070,000,
Harris said.
   Harris said the auction Wednesday at Christie's fetched $31.7
million for 60 works of art. The auction of contemporary art
continues Thursday.
   ``Colored Alphabet,'' an oil and paper collage by Jasper Johns
sold for $3.5 million, the second highest price bid on Wednesday
but not a new record for a Johns.
   Other artist records at the Christie's auction included:
   _$715,000 for an Ellsworth Kelly painting, ``Black Triangle With
White.''
   _$880,000 for a Robert Motherwell painting, ``Elegy to the
Spanish Republic No. 134.''
   All prices include a 10 percent house commission.
   ``August Day,'' an oil on canvas painting by Franz Kline sold
for $2.7 million.
   A Jackson Pollock triptych, a series of three drip paintings on
three canvasses in black, red and yellow brought $2.2 million.
   ``Things on the Wall'' by Roy Lichtenstein sold for $1,012,000.
   The auction Wednesday at Christie's is the second day of a
12-day selling spree at that auction house and its rival _
Sotheby's. The two houses are expected to sell 4,400 pieces of art
for more than $500 million.
   On Tuesday, record prices were set for 27 contemporary artists
at Sotheby's. Total receipts of $78.6 million there set a record
for a contemporary art auction.
   Another Pollock drip painting, ``Number 8, 1950,'' painting sold
for $11.5 million at the Sotheby's auction.
   ``Triptych May-June,'' done by Francis Bacon in 1973, inspired
by the suicide of the artist's close friend, George Dyer, fetched
$6.2 million.
   Warhol's ``Red Jackie,'' which depicts a ruby-lipped Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis as First Lady in 1963, sold for $750,000 _ more
than twice its presale estimate.
   On Saturday, a Sotheby's sale of 20th Century decorative arts
will include a two-story town house commissioned in 1950 by Mrs.
John D. Rockefeller III.
   Christie's on May 10 and 11 will feature five Monets, seven
Picassos, 10 Renoir and four works by Degas.

<TEXT>
   A year after fire gutted 4{ floors of the
62-story First Interstate Bank tower and killed a worker,
prosecutors filed 12 misdemeanor charges against nine companies
Wednesday in connection with the blaze.
   Two counts of the complaint filed by the district attorney and
city attorney referred to the death of Alexander Handy, 24, a
maintenance man who died May 4, 1988, after riding an elevator to
the 12th floor, where the fire started, to investigate an alarm.
   Forty other people suffered smoke inhalation in the city's worst
high-rise fire, which caused more than $450 million in damage.
   Deputy District Attorney David Guthman said there is a
three-year statute of limitations on filing felony charges. The
decision to file misdemeanor charges, he said, was prompted by the
misdemeanor statute of limitations which runs out Friday.
   If convicted, the defendants face various fines ranging from
$1,000 on municipal violations to $10,000 on state labor code
violations
   Among those charged in the complaint were First Interstate Bank
of California and Pedus Security Services, which was in charge of
security.
   The corporations charged in the misdemeanor complaint included
those owning part of the building or those involved in its security
and maintenance.
   The charges alleged seven violations of the state Labor Code and
five of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, including blocking a fire
exit, failing to maintain fire equipment and failing to maintain an
accident protection program. The charges also allege failure to
call in an alarm and failure to notify the Fire Department of
inoperative equipment.
   Others charged with violations were Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the United States, United California Bank Realty Corp.,
Cosco Fire Protection Inc., Commercial Building Maintenance Co.,
American Building Maintenance, First Interstate Bank Ltd., and
First Interstate Bancorp.
   Cosco was installing fire sprinklers at the time of the fire,
and was charged in connection with the closing of water mains in
the building.
   During the blaze a ring of flame roiled around the 12th through
15th floors for nearly four hours, showering streets with glass and
flaming debris and chasing people to the roof where 10 were plucked
to safety by helicopters.
   Others fled down smoky stairwells. Thirty-seven maintenance
workers and three firemen were treated for smoke inhalation.
   The cause of the conflagration was never determined because the
2,000-degree fire destroyed clues, but investigators eliminated
arson as a possibility.
   The 859-foot-tall building had no sprinkler system because it
was built in 1973, a year before fire codes were modified to
require sprinklers. The 62-story tower was the tallest in the city
at the time of the fire.

<TEXT>
   A woman who sued a hospital after she
contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion has died from
complications of the disease.
   Edwina Murphy, 48, died at her family home last Thursday. She
filed suit against Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula in
December 1983 after becoming infected with the virus through
unscreened blood.
   Officials later discovered the blood had been donated by a known
heroin addict who died two months after Murphy received the
transfusion. At least three other people have died from the same
blood, said Murphy's attorney, Terry O'Reilly of Menlo Park.
   Murphy's lawsuit alleges gross negligence and seeks $1.5 million
in damages.
   The hospital had fought to keep the case from going to trial,
arguing it should be decided through arbitration. In September
1988, a California appellate court overturned a lower court
decision ordering the case to trial.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a
virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   University of Massachusetts students opposing Pentagon-funded
research took over campus offices for the third time in two weeks
Wednesday in one of several college protests around the nation.
   At the University of California-Berkeley, nearly all the 3,200
graduate research and teaching assistants staged a walkout to
demand recognition for their union.
   In New York, students who took over buildings at City University
of New York campuses last week to protest a proposed tuition hike
continued their occupation despite Gov. Mario Cuomo's veto of the
proposal late Tuesday.
   Students, concerned about possible spending cuts, asked Cuomo to
meet them at a ``neutral site'' in Harlem.
   In Atlanta, up to 175 people gathered among ``for-sale'' signs
put up on Mercer University's College of Arts and Sciences for a
24-hour ``read-in'' to protest a decision to close the campus in
June 1990.
   Students at Kent State University in Ohio who say a planned
memorial to the four students slain by National Guardsmen there in
1970 is not big enough planned a protest on the 19th anniversary of
the shootings Thursday.
   In Amherst, Mass., about 150 students marched to the University
of Massachusetts' Graduate Research Center after an afternoon rally
at the Student Union. About half that number pushed aside three
campus police officers trying to block the entrance to the 2{-story
annex to the Graduate Research Towers.
   ``We didn't think we'd be able to get into that building,'' said
organizer Jonathan Leavitt, a 22-year-old junior at the
25,000-student campus. ``We thought they would be smart enough to
see the potential target, and they weren't.''
   Police closed the building to all but faculty members who work
there, and locked a corridor holding the protesters to keep them
from taking over more offices. Officers guarded other buildings.
   As the takeover continued late Wednesday, university
administrators agreed to make public all documents relating to the
research, and said a panel of students, faculty and administrators
would be formed to discuss its future. The announcement followed a
meeting of students, faculty and administrators.
   The two previous takeovers of other campus buildings resulted in
68 arrests.
   The Berkeley walkout by over union recognition came with just
two weeks to go before final examinations.
   ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Union busting's got to go!'' sign-carrying
teaching and research assistants chanted as they demonstrated at
every major entrance to the campus.
   Their union, the Association for Graduate Student Employees, is
affiliated with the United Auto Workers. The students say they are
underpaid, overworked and often forced to go without health and
other benefits.
   About 90 percent ot the 3,200 graduate assistants took part in
the walkout, the association claimed. There are about 9,000
graduate students at Berkeley.
   According to a selective survey by the association of 307
classes through Wednesday afternoon, 66 percent were canceled, 25
percent were less than half-full, and 9 percent were at capacity.
   University spokesman Tom Debley said the results were not
necessarily representative of the campus, which has 23,000
undergraduates.
   In New York, students released a list of demands that included
no staff or faculty layoffs in the City University of New York,
more social services for students and amnesty for protesters.
   ``We will not relinquish the buildings at this particular time
because Governor Cuomo has not met all of our demands,'' Abdallah
Muhammad, a student at New York City Technical College in Brooklyn,
said at a news conference at City College. ``One of our major
demands is to meet with Cuomo.''
   Cuomo reiterated he would not meet with students while sit-ins
continued. ``I'll talk to them when they're legal,'' he said in
Rochester. ``If there's anything that education should start with,
the first rule is you live by the law.''

   Fetuses aborted in North Carolina would be
disposed of only through burial, cremation or approved types of
incineration unless used for research under a bill enacted
Wednesday by the state Legislature.
   The House of Representatives approved the bill 91-0. It cleared
the Senate by a wide margin, and is expected to become law Thursday
when signed by Lt. Gov. Jim Gardner and House Speaker Joe Mavretic.
   The bill was the idea of Sen. Ollie Harris, a funeral director.
He did not introduce the bill because he said he felt it would
appear he had a conflict of interest. It was sponsored by Sen. A.D.
Guy.
   The bill's disposal requirements do not apply to fetuses used
for medical research and development of pharmaceuticals.
   Harris, a leader in the battle to reduce North Carolina's fund
for poor women's abortions, said he never envisoned the
fetus-disposal bill as having any effect on the debate over whether
abortion should be legal.
   The bill directs the state Commission for Health Services to
adopt regulations on fetus disposal in accordance with the
requirement that fetuses ``be disposed of in a manner limited to
burial, cremation or approved hospital type of incineration.''

<HEAD>ABC Engineers and Technicians Reject Contract Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of engineers and
technicians who work for Capital Cities-ABC voted Wednesday to
reject what the network called its final contract offer, union
officials said.
   The company said it would meet with leaders of the National
Association for Broadcast Employees and Technicians, but only to
reiterate its position.
   ``We want to meet with the union as soon as possible to make
sure the leadership and its members understand that the terms of
our final offer will not be renegotiated,'' said company
spokeswoman Patricia Matson.
   The union's chief negotiator, Thomas F. Kennedy, said he would
meet with company officials, and expressed optimism they would
negotiate further.
   ``That's what the collective bargaining process is all about,''
Kennedy said. ``We're not in a strike-vote situation yet.''
   A dozen of NABET's 18 bargaining units voted to reject the
company's proposal, said union spokesman John Krieger. WLS-AM radio
news writers, who are considered part of a 19th unit, also rejected
the offer.
   All units must ratify a contract before it can take effect,
Krieger said.
   Ms. Matson said the company felt ``sad and dismayed'' about the
rejection.
   The number of workers represented is disputed. Krieger said
there are 2,477 workers, while ABC says there are 2,150. The union
did not release the vote tally.
   Union negotiators had recommended rejection of the offer, which
was made after a month of negotiations that ended March 31.
   About 85 percent of the workers are engineers who handle
cameras, lights and audio equipment and other technical tasks. The
union also represents news writers, mail messengers, receptionists,
wardrobe specialists and others.
   The average engineer makes $47,000 in base pay, Krieger said.
ABC said that with overtime the average engineer earns about
$70,000.
   The rejected contract would have provided a one-time 10 percent
ratification bonus if approved by May 15, in lieu of a raise in the
first year. The bonus drops to 3 percent if the contract is
ratified after May 15.
   The rejected pact also would have provided 3 percent wage
increases in the second and third years and a 5 percent lump sum
bonus in the fourth year.
   The offer also included a virtual guarantee that none of the
about 2,000 full-time television employees would be laid off in the
contract's first three years.
   Capital Cities-ABC said the offer would mean the layoffs of 60
or 70 radio engineers soon after ratification. The union put the
figure closer to 125.
   NABET last struck ABC for 20 weeks in 1977 and for nine weeks in
1967. The union struck NBC in 1987 for 17 weeks.

   WASHINGTON (AP ) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday night reufused
to postpone the execution of convicted child-slayer Aubrey Dennis
Adams Jr., who was scheduled to die Thursday morning in Florida.
   The justices voted 7-2 to reject Adams' emergency request to

   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose
the death penalty in all circumstances, voted to spare Adams.
   Adams, a former correctional officer at the Marion Correctional

Jan. 23, 1978, of an 8-year-old Marion County girl.
   His execution was scheduled for 7 a.m. EDT Thursday at the

   President Bush is getting everything he wanted
and more from the House Banking Committee to prevent S&amp;Ls from
tapping the taxpayers for another bailout, but only in exchange for
new low-income housing initiatives.
   On a 49-2 vote just before midnight Tuesday, the committee
approved Bush's $90 billion savings and loan plan _ the largest
financial bailout in the nation's history _ after spending four
days toughening capital standards on the industry and adding a pair
of housing components.
   Only Reps. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, voted
no. Kennedy said the bill did not have enough housing support for
the poor and complained about the panel's rejection of his
provisions attacking lending discrimination. Leach said he wanted
still tougher capital standards.
   As it now stands, the House bill would require the nation's
3,000 thrifts to put up at least $20 billion in new capital over
the next five years _ twice as much as a version approved by the
Senate two weeks ago _ to fulfill Bush's promise of ``Never again.''

   The one-day boycott of Exxon products around the country is the
start of a ``war of words and actions'' against the nation's
largest oil company over its huge Alaskan spill, environmentalists
and politicians say.
   The campaign Tuesday met with mixed results in scattered cities
and dissents from independent service stations who say they're
victims of the spill, too.
   ``I just think the end result is not going to be to hurt the
people who are responsible,'' said Evan Jaeger, who manages an
Exxon station in Elmwood Park, N.J. ``It's going to hurt the little
guy trying to make a living.''
   Exxon issued a statement calling the boycott unjust, and a
company executive defended the cleanup of the spill.

   Senate investigators say they've discovered at
least two ``silence-for-money'' deals between builders of a Texas
nuclear power plant and workers who received payments in return for
dropping allegations of safety hazards.
   The Senate subcommittee on nuclear regulation said Tuesday it is
widening its investigation to determine the frequency and legality
of these secret deals.
   ``It's beginning to look like something that's throughout the
industry,'' said Bob Mann, an aide to Sen. John Breaux, D-La., the
subcommittee chairman.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses commercial
nuclear power stations and enforces safety rules, has not commented
publicly on the acceptability of agreements that limit a plant
worker's ability to raise safety issues.

   Thousands of public water systems across the
country will have to improve their purification equipment to reduce
chemical contamination and comply with new Environmental Protection
Agency standards.
   The EPA on Tuesday proposed federally required ceilings on the
maximum amounts of 38 types of cancer-causing chemicals and other
pollutants allowed in drinking water.
   Michael Cook, director of the EPA office which deals with
drinking water contaminants, said most public water systems already
meet the proposed requirements, but additional purification
equipment will probably be needed in about 2,500 public systems,
serving about 2 million people, mostly in rural areas.
   In some cases households will be paying higher water bills _
anywhere from $10 to $460 more a year _ as a result, officials
said, although the new requirements in many cases are unlikely to
go into effect until 1991.

   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist urged
Congress today to give the nation's federal judges an immediate 30
percent pay raise.
   Calling inadequate salaries ``the most serious threat to the
future of the judiciary,'' Rehnquist sought support for legislation
providing the raise and regular cost-of-living adjustments.
   ``This is not, in my view, fairly termed a pay raise,''
Rehnquist said in a prepared statement to the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee. ``This is instead a partial recapture of
the tremendous decline in purchasing power that has affected
judicial salaries over the last 20 years.''
   A 30 percent pay increase would boost the chief justice's annual
salary from $115,000 to $149,500. Salaries of Supreme Court
justices would rise from $110,000 to $143,000; appeals court judges
from $95,000 to $123,500; and trial judges from $89,500 to $116,00.

   With all votes counted in Tuesday's special election, the
two-year mining tax hike won 107,679 to 30,663. The other question
won by 74,418 to 63,228.
   Voter turnout was a low 36 percent. Election officials around
the state had predicted turnouts ranging from 30 percent to 40
percent of the more than 383,000 people eligible to vote.

   Catholic educators say they are pleased at the
Vatican's readiness to modify a proposed document on Catholic
colleges and universities that had drawn much American criticism.
   Three North Americans were named to a 15-member international
commission to assist in a major revision of the document.
   Its initial draft in 1985 had aroused keen objections from U.S.
Catholic educators as projecting a degree of ecclesiastical control
over colleges that would not be acceptable on the American academic
scene.
   That draft was revised, but educators at their April 18-25
meeting with Vatican officials called for further major revisions,
and the commission was set up to guide the process.
   Americans on the commission are the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare,
president of Fordham University; the Rev. Edward A. Malloy,
president of the University of Notre Dame; and Sister Sally Furay,
provost of the University of San Diego.

   The leader of Reform Judaism says AIDS has
``stirred demons in our own soul'' by spawning a wave of hysteria
whose symptoms include prejudice and ostracism.
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, told a synagogue audience that AIDS
sufferers, already facing death, are victimized through loss of
jobs and rejection by family and friends.
   He said such denigration often infects the victims. ``Their
self-image mirrors society's distaste for them and so they begin to
hate themselves.''

<HEAD>Religious Right Seems Mostly Quiescent, Resting On Laurels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The religious right, lacking a charismatic
leader and fresh from its success in keeping a Republican in the
White House, may be in danger of being pushed out of the political
arena by an old foe: apathy.
   The Rev. Ed Dobson and Ed Hindson, who each spent more than a
decade leading evangelicals out of the political closet as
architects of the Moral Majority, contend in a new book that
religious conservatives are searching for new leadership.
   ``I think the vast majority of fundamentalists ... are kind of
in neutral,'' said Dobson, once considered the successor to Jerry
Falwell's evangelistic empire.
   With Falwell announcing his withdrawal from politics and Pat
Robertson's unsuccessful presidential candidacy, Dobson said,
``There is no charismatic person to put it together.''
   Dobson and Hindson, authors of ``The Seduction of Power:
Preachers, Politics and the Media,'' discussed the emergence of the
religious right as a political force at a recent conference
sponsored by the Center on Religion &amp; Society.
   Hindson said the religious right's success in electing former
President Reagan and President Bush _ who support evangelical
positions on abortion and ``family life'' issues _ may have left
some evangelicals apathetic.
   ``They don't see themselves threatened by the political party in
power,'' said Hindson. One poll showed more than 80 percent of
white evangelicals supported Bush, he said. ``I think the average
fundamentalist-evangelical is thinking, `Hey, eight more good
years. Why worry about it?'''
   The exception to the political inertia among religious
conservatives is the abortion issue, Hindson and Dobson said.
   Operation Rescue _ a series of protests outside abortion clinics
_ shows increased activism among ``younger, more radical''
religious conservatives, said Hindson, a former religion professor
at Falwell's Liberty University before becoming executive director
of the Center for Biblical Counseling and Education in St. Louis.
   For evangelicals who believe abortion involves the taking of a
human life, Hindson said, ``It is the ultimate moral issue of our
times.''
   The march on Washington of at least 300,000 people advocating
legalized abortion may jar more evangelicals back into the
political arena, he added. ``I think what happened ... is going to
cause or force renewed coalitions among Catholics and evangelicals
on the abortion issue.''
   In their book, Dobson and Hindson say the religious right has
had mixed success with its political agenda, fending off the Equal
Rights Amendment and the gay rights movement, but failing to bring
about significant changes on issues such as abortion and public
school prayers.
   But Dobson dismisses criticism that fundamentalists were
exploited by the Republican Party. He contends the religious right
was ``granted legitimacy'' by the GOP.
   ``I would argue the religious right used the Republican Party as
much as the Republican Party used the religious right,'' said
Dobson, a former editor of the Fundamentalist Journal who worked
with Falwell for 15 years before becoming the senior pastor of
Calvary Church in Grand Rapids, Mich.
   Still, the men said, the new prominence fundamentalists have
enjoyed in the media has also been a mixed blessing, with the
downfall in sex scandals of TV evangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy
Swaggart bringing unwanted notoriety.
   When Falwell tried to step in to save Bakker's PTL ministry,
Hindson said, he became ``a man in a white suit stomping all over
the barnyard.''
   Hindson also said his old boss, through such actions as labeling
Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu a ``phony'' and his
religiously based defense of such individuals as Oliver North and
deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, provided an example
of the dangers of stretching religious principles to defend extreme
political views.
   Saying evangelicals need to keep their political involvement in
perspective, Hindson told a joke about Robertson that is making the
rounds of evangelical pastors:
   ``Why would God let Pat Roberston run for the presidency?
   ``One reason was to keep him out of the ministry and the other
was to keep him out of the White House.''

<HEAD>Bad Cop, Good Cop _ Bush and Cheney</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a tactic familiar to anyone who watches
television crime shows _ the bad cop is menacing, the good cop is
calm and reassuring, and they're both out for the same thing.
   By design or by accident, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney is
cast as the bad cop in the flap over his forecast of failure for
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's efforts to change the society
he leads.
   President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III are the
good guys, cheering on the economic and political reforms Gorbachev
has undertaken. They venture no guesses on the outcome.
   Cheney never said he didn't want perestroika to succeed. What he
said was that he didn't like the odds and that the United States
shouldn't make wholesale defense cuts on the assumption that the
new look in Moscow will be permanent.
   That's hardly a surprising observation for the man assigned to
steer the Pentagon budget through Congress. Nor is it a new one.
Cheney speculated 10 days ago that Gorbachev might eventually be
forced to change to a more conservative course or to yield power.
   And Cheney is not the only skeptic in the new administration.
The course has been one of caution while policies are reviewed and
Washington tries to determine how solid the changes in Moscow may
prove to be.
   ``Looking around the world today, in the developing countries
and even in the communist bloc, we see the triumph of two great
ideas _ the idea of free government and the idea of free
enterprise,'' Bush said Tuesday.
   But there is no sign of haste to overhaul U.S. defense policies
because of the changes in Moscow, including Gorbachev's multiple
target peace campaign. In Red Square last Monday, flowers and peace
banners supplanted the menacing missiles of past May Day parades.
Cheney's question is whether that can last.
   Even the humor shows signs of the times. Bush joked in a speech
Monday that the ministry of economic planning had its own unit in
the Moscow parade, ``200 economists marching along yelling `Mayday,
mayday.''' After the laughter, he added, ``but today that's
beginning to change.''
   The Cheney comments that stirred all this into a weekend
controversy were made in an April 29 interview with columnists
Rowland Evans and Robert Novak on Cable News Network. In it, the
defense secretary said ``until we know that Gorbachev is for real
and that the changes he wants to bring about are irreversible,'' it
would be a mistake for the United States to cut its NATO forces.
   Then came the impolitic comment that led to the flap:
   ``I think you have to distinguish between what he's trying to do
and whether or not he's actually going to be able to do it. And I
think the bottom line is that if I had to guess today, I would
guess that he would ultimately fail. That is to say that he will
not be able to reform the Soviet economy to turn it into an
efficient, modern society, and when that happens, he's likely to be
replaced by somebody who will be far more hostile than he's been in
terms of his attitude toward the West.''
   Later in the interview, Cheney said he thinks Gorbachev has set
an impossible task by seeking fundamental reform of the Soviet
system within a relatively short time.
   ``You have to be cautious not to perceive greater change than
actually occurs,'' he said. ``We've had a brief period of time with
a man who appears to be more of a realist and pursuing policies
friendlier to the West. We don't know whether that's a permanent
change that's going to last or whether it's a temporary aberration.
   ``As long as there's a possibility it's an aberration, we have
to be careful.''
   Bush and his spokesmen were quick to disown the oddsmaking on
Gorbachev's future. The president said he wants the economic
reforms of perestroika to succeed, and that he'd told Gorbachev so
when they met in New York, prior to his inauguration.
   ``Whenever in the world there is economic reform, the United
States should be hoping that reform succeeds,'' he told the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce on Monday. ``Economic reform, with its emphasis
on incentives and market economics, leads to more freedom.''
   The White House spokesman said Bush, Baker and Cheney all want
the Gorbachev reforms to succeed. ``We all agree that glasnost and
perestroika should be encouraged,'' said Marlin Fitzwater.
   And does the administration believe the reforms will succeed?
   ``The administration chooses not to speculate on that matter.''

   Susan Harris says ``The Golden Girls'' began
with a suggestion that she write about a group of older women in
Miami.
   But when the ``suggestion'' comes from Brandon Tartikoff,
president of NBC Entertainment, it's a little hard to dismiss.
   ``I hadn't wanted to do any more television,'' said Harris, who
had created ``Soap'' and ``Benson.''
   ``But that appealed to me. I like writing about older people.
They have more to say. They've led rich lives. That's really how it
started. After that I came up with the concept and the characters.
We got the stars we wanted.''
   The 100th episode of ``The Golden Girls'' airs Saturday. The
Emmy-winning series just completed its third season. It was fifth
in the Nielsen ratings for the season. Another Harris creation,
``Empty Nest,'' a spinoff of ``The Golden Girls,'' was in ninth
place.
   ``The Golden Girls'' are four women living in retirement in the
same house in Miami. Bea Arthur plays Dorothy Zbornak, a
no-nonsense former schoolteacher whose husband left her for a
younger woman; Betty White is Rose Nylund, a naive, widowed grief
counselor; Rue McClanahan plays Blanche Devereaux, an aging
Southern coquette; and Estelle Getty is Dorothy's mother, Sophia
Petrillo, whose uncontrollable bluntness was caused by a stroke.
   ``Estelle Getty was the only unknown when we started casting,''
said Harris. ``She came in, read the part and in two minutes we
said, `That's it.'''
   The cast of the pilot also included a gay houseboy, but he was
reluctantly dropped when the roles of the four women proved to be
much richer than expected.
   ``The contrast between the four women breeds the conflict,''
said Harris. ``We had to make them quite different or you'd end up
with 30 minutes of `nice.' Dorothy comes from Queens. She's the
most outspoken, the sharpest, the strongest character. She's a
survivor. Rose is not quite in the world. She's been protected all
her life, so there's a bit of the ingenue about her. She's an
innocent, a bit like Jessica in `Soap.'
   ``Blanche is a throwback to the Old South. She's antebellum.
She's Scarlett O'Hara. She thinks she's hot stuff, but she's
growing older and is having a tough time. Sophia is an Italian
mother who spent a lot of time in New York. She's a tough cookie.
We gave her a small stroke that wiped out her brain censor so she
could say what everyone else would like to say but doesn't.''
   Harris said she believes there's lots of life left in the
``Girls'' and that the award-winning show can go on for many more
years.
   Harris confines her writing these days to motion pictures. ``My
husband calls me the creator-deserter,'' she said. After ``Soap,''
she married Paul Witt of Witt-Thomas Productions, makers of ``The
Golden Girls'' and ``Empty Nest.''
   She no longer writes episodic TV because for four years she
wrote every script for ``Soap.''
   ``I will never, ever do that again,'' she said. ``I had to give
up my life to do that. It was a nightmare. I never stopped working.
I couldn't get sick. I worked day and night. I'll never do that
again. My son was 9 or 10 at the time, and I didn't get to see much
of him.
   ``It's a tradeoff. Before `Soap' I lived in a tiny house in the
Valley. I discussed it with my son. I said this was a way to buy a
house. So when he was 14, he had a nice house with a swimming pool.
I don't regret it. It gave me a chance to be more creative than I'd
ever been.''
   Harris said she now works slowly. She also takes plenty of time
out to spend with her family, which now includes a new baby.
   Before she began writing she was a housewife who held a number
of different jobs.
   ``I began writing the way a lot of people do,'' she said. ``I
was watching TV one night and it was such garbage. I said I could
write better than that. I got a copy of a teleplay and used it as a
guide. I sold the first thing I wrote, a script for `Then Came
Bronson.'''
   After that she wrote for ``All in the Family,'' ``Maude'' and
other comedies, then created ``Fay.''
   Harris is still angry about the fate of ``Soap.'' She said it
was the victim of misinformation and was canceled after four years
on the air because of pressure from conservative groups who thought
it too risque.
   ``It could have gone on for many years,'' she said. ``Some
stations wouldn't even run it in prime time. I think the show was
done in good taste. It's all so innocuous today.''

<HEAD>Home Equity Credit: Handle With Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the many financial innovations of the
1980s, few have achieved as much broad popularity as the
home-equity loan.
   It isn't hard to understand why. Home-equity loans serve as a
convenient way to tap one of the nation's greatest pools of wealth.
   On top of that, changes in the laws have given them a special
tax status. In contrast to most other types of consumer borrowing,
interest paid on the typical home-equity loan remains fully
deductible, within specified limits.
   But with all their advantages, home-equity loans also carry with
them more potential risks and drawbacks than many people realize,
financial advisers say.
   As Albert Ellentuck at the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp;
Horwath puts it: ``Home-equity loan agreements, like cigarette
packages, should carry a consumer warning in large type _ `Caution!
This loan could be hazardous to your financial health.'''
   The biggest pitfall in home-equity borrowing _ the risk of
losing your house if you can't keep up with payments _ has been
widely publicized, and deservedly so.
   This point alone makes a powerful case against using home-equity
credit for any frivolous or short-term purpose, such as a vacation
or a shopping spree.
   Ideally, the money borrowed should finance an asset with a vaue
at least as great as the total cost of the loan, and expected to
last at least as long as the term of the loan.
   The most obvious example of this kind of asset would be
improvements to the property itself.
   ``Say you take out a 10-year home equity loan to finance a new
car,'' Ellentuck observes.
   ``The car is gone long before you've paid off your loan. By
stretching the debt over so long a period, you're just racking up
huge interest charges.''
   This may seem to be plain common sense. But Ellentuck points out
that there are some other possible perils with home-equity loans
that aren't so readily apparent.
   Home-equity credit often is touted as an inexpensive way to
borrow, since lenders generally charge lower interest rates on
loans backed by such solid collateral.
   Although that may be true in principle, Ellentuck says,
appraisal costs, other up-front charges and annual account fees
make some equity loans a lot more costly than the stated interest
rate suggests.
   Watch out in particular, he counsels, for deals with
bargain-basement ``teaser'' interest rates that can be raised
sharply just a few months after the loan is made.
   In many home-equity deals, borrowers are allowed to pay only
interest charges for a period of time without repaying any of the
principal.
   Whatever advantages that may afford, Ellentuck points out, it
makes a loan more expensive than a conventional arrangement in
which payments cover both interest and part of the principal.
That's because the balance due remains at its original, high level.
   Furthermore, such a setup typically leaves you faced with a
``balloon'' payment at the end of the loan's term, which may or may
not be easy to finance at that time.
   ``If you're seriously considering a home equity loan, shop
around,'' Ellentuck concludes.
   ``Look for a loan that imposes no points on closing, offers a
low cap on the increase in your variable interest rate, and charges
annual fees of $20 or less.''

<HEAD>Why We Save So Little</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One reason why Americans save so little is the
bomb, said the professor. If there's no tomorrow, that is, you'll
just be a gone fool.
   This is the latest contribution to the literature of why
Americans don't save more of their income. It is now a massive
collection and growing; no academic can retain his reputation
without taking a stab at the problem.
   The bomb thesis has been developed by Joel B. Slemrod of the
University of Michigan. Based on his studies of 20 non-communist
nations, the low-saving American registers the highest level of
fear of nuclear war.
   In 1986, he explains, 49 percent of his American respondents
felt there was an ``even or better-than-even chance'' of a nuclear
war within 10 years. At the same time, the U.S. savings rate was
19th. Only France's rate was lower.
   In Japan, on the other hand, only 15 percent of those surveyed
in the same year believed the chance of nuclear war within a decade
was 50 percent or better. Japan's savings rate was bettered only by
Italy and Luxembourg.
   Slemrod believes the evidence might compel a lot of economists
to revise their views of why Americans save relatively little. In
the past, he says, ``a lot of people have been blaming it on taxes
and the social security system.''
   And, you might add, on dozens of other things. On demographics,
for example. A surge of 25-to-34-year-olds has been coursing
through the economy. They must buy furniture, houses, cars,
children's clothing and such with money that otherwise might have
been put into savings.
   According to the theory, as these yuppies become older they'll
transmogrify into couch potatoes. They will sit before their
television sets, content not to keep buying and traveling. They
will save and invest for the future.
   That's just one notion. Among the others is that the methodology
by which savings statistics are amassed is faulty. As some explain
it, Americans use their houses as banks, but the statisticians
don't count that as saving.
   Social Security and private pension plans have been blamed. They
make Americans complacent about their futures, it is said, although
that notion is receiving a severe jolt from the actual, painful
experiences of retirees.
   There is no end to the possibilities that have been seriously
studied at academic institutions, analyzed by elected officials and
speculated on by economists. But there are also some very obvious
reasons that require no study.
   Such as:
   _In America, savings are taxed. It used to be even worse:
Savings were taxed while debt earned the borrower a great tax
deduction. In regard to housing debt it remains so. Even credit
card debt still gets a small deduction. The tax system in many
other countries encourages saving, even exempting some earned
interest from the tax collector.
   That idea caught on strongly in the United States a decade or so
ago with Individual Retirement Accounts. But IRAs have since been
weakened. Taxes on interest earnings are deferred, but no longer is
there a tax deduction.
   _In the United States, keeping up with the Joneses is a much
derided but much practiced philosophy of life. This is a consumer
society, not a saver society.
   If you don't think so, examine the basic theme of many
advertisements: If your neighbor has something why don't you?
Aren't you as good in every way as your neighbor? Then demonstrate
it.
   Consider some of the other themes: One car is not enough.
Neither is one bath in your house. In fact, one house isn't enough;
good heavens, what do you do on weekends?
   Save? Banks are for saving, aren't they? Maybe not, as you might
conclude from examining the literature you receive from them. How
many seek to have you save with them? How many offer you credit
instead?
   The U.S. personal savings rate rarely exceeds 6 percent,
compared with 20 percent or so in Japan. It is indeed puzzling, and
social scientists will question each other about it for many
academic years.
   The answer, however, is far more likely to come directly from
the source _ from the American consumer, who may indeed save little
because of the bomb, but who also might be borrowing more for the
same reason.

Crusade, said of the spiritual state of the Soviet Union, where he
has preached:
   ``I believe it is one of the most religious countries in the
world. They've just not been allowed to express this religion in
years past. I think we're going to see something good come out of
what is happening now, if people don't push too fast.''
   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The leader of Reform Judaism says AIDS has
``stirred demons in our own soul'' by spawning a wave of hysteria
whose symptoms include prejudice and ostracism.
   Rabbi Alexander Schindler, president of the Union of American
Hebrew Congregations, told a synagogue audience that AIDS
sufferers, already facing death, are victimized through loss of
jobs and rejection by family and friends.
   He said such denigration often infects the victims. ``Their
self-image mirrors society's distaste for them and so they begin to
hate themselves.''

   Catholic educators say they are pleased at the
Vatican's readiness to modify a proposed document on Catholic
colleges and universities that had drawn much American criticism.
   Three North Americans were named to a 15-member international
commission to assist in a major revision of the document.
   Its initial draft in 1985 had aroused keen objections from U.S.
Catholic educators as projecting a degree of ecclesiastical control
over colleges that would not be acceptable on the American academic
scene.
   That draft was revised, but educators at their April 18-25
meeting with Vatican officials called for further major revisions,
and the commission was set up to guide the process.
   Americans on the commission are the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare,
president of Fordham University; the Rev. Edward A. Malloy,
president of the University of Notre Dame; and Sister Sally Furay,
provost of the University of San Diego.

   In the temporary Navajo Tribal Council
office, one clock runs five minutes faster than another a few feet
away, an unintended symbol of a government thrown out of sync by
the alleged corruption of its chairman.
   Peter MacDonald, who had held the highest office of the
200,000-member tribe with one interruption since 1971, was voted
out by the tribal council in February following allegations that he
demanded kickbacks.
   The 60-year-old MacDonald, who says he's innocent, has lived for
years like a potentate in plain view of Indians whose austere
circumstances are proverbial. And yet while he rode in limousines
and flew to Europe, Hawaii and the Super Bowl, he also promised
economic development _ a vision of herdsmen becoming technicians.
   After spending $650,000 to remodel his offices following his
January 1987 inauguration, MacDonald was secure in his fourth term
until January when the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs began investigating corruption in tribal governments.
   Witness after witness told of MacDonald demanding kickbacks. His
son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., testified after receiving
immunity from prosecution, using a code term in speaking of
under-the-table payments to his father as ``golf balls.''
   When the 88-member Tribal Council began its winter meeting in
early February, it rebelled.
   On Feb. 17, a Friday night after many MacDonald supporters had
left, the dissidents voted 49-13 to place him and Vice Chairman
Johnny Thompson on administrative leave.
   The majority picked Leonard Haskie as interim chairman on March
10 and has stood united since, giving rise to th name ``49ers.''
   ``The joke around here is that it's the 49ers versus the
Stealers,'' said Cecil Jones of Chinle.
   Past Navajo leaders ``usually were very wealthy men, but I
wouldn't say they compare to MacDonald,'' said Duane Beyal,
Haskie's press secretary and chief assistant to former chairman
Peterson Zah. ``With them, they were counting herds of sheep; with
MacDonald, it's the green stuff.''
   In visits to some of the 109 reservation chapters, or wards,
MacDonald has maintained his innocence. He has refused repeated
Associated Press requests for interviews and declined to respond in
writing to a list of questions.
   Although the Navajo Supreme Court upheld the council action,
MacDonald refused to stop giving orders or vacate what Haskie calls
``the Mahogany Palace'' wing of the administration building.
   ``I am innocent. And I am entitled under the law to be presumed
innocent. But the Tribal Council could care less,'' MacDonald wrote
in an opinion piece for the Gallup (N.M.) Independent.
   He has acknowledged taking ``gifts'' from contractors but argues
gift exchanges are a time-honored way of doing business by Indian
chiefs. To Haskie, that's a distortion of Indian tradition.
   ``Those gifts were tokens to establish a longterm friendship
with an individual, not hundreds of thousands of dollars but small
things _ bracelets, moccasins, a shawl,'' Haskie said.
   No one knows how much MacDonald realized from the tribe's 1987
purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch, a 491,000-acre spread in
north-central Arizona. Phoenix real estate broker Byron ``Bud''
Brown testified that he arranged for a Scottsdale oilman to buy the
ranch for $26.2 million and sell it a few hours later to the
Navajos for $33.4 million.
   Brown said he gave MacDonald $50,000 in cash and the use of a
BMW sedan, along with paying off a $25,000 loan; dissidents claim
MacDonald may have received one-tenth of the profit. A federal
grand jury in Phoenix is investigating the allegations.
   In 1975, MacDonald was indicted on fraud and income-tax-evasion
charges. A deadlocked U.S. District Court jury in May 1977 failed
to reach a verdict, and the judge ordered a directed verdict of
acquittal.
   The longtime tribal leader is not without defenders.
   ``Mr. MacDonald is a very strong statesman for Indian people
across the country,'' said Donald Benally, chairman of the
council's Advisory Committee until Haskie named a new panel.
   ``I think we would have really made a big stride in our economic
development if Mr. MacDonald would've gone on without any political
interruptions.''
   MacDonald, an electrical engineer, worked in the aerospace
industry in Southern California before he returned to the
reservation, where people still live in traditional, five-sided,
log-and-mud hogans tucked into remote canyons or squatting atop
wind-swept mesas.
   The native of Teec Nos Pos, a tiny community less than five
miles from both Utah and New Mexico in the Four Corners heartland
of Navajo tradition, served three terms as chairman before Zah won
the 1982 election.
   Four years later, MacDonald defeated Zah by about 750 votes out
of 61,000 cast.
   Haskie said he doesn't know whether he'll run for the
$55,000-a-year position in 1990. He added that he expects the
chairmanship to have less power when he leaves office.
   ``I never sought this job; it just happened so fast,'' said the
43-year-old civil engineer.
   Haskie has persuaded the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and
Citibank Corp. of Arizona that he is legally in charge.
   James H. Stevens, the BIA's Navajo Area director, said courts
had upheld the council majority's action despite MacDonald's claim
that a two-thirds majority was needed to remove him from office.
   Noting that Citibank had decided to honor Haskie's signature on
checks, Stevens strengthened Haskie's hand on April 6 by empowering
him to allocate contracts controlling $91 million in federal funds
for such purposes as Navajo police work, forest management, fire
and judicial services.
   Stevens, a San Carlos Apache who grew up in Arizona, views the
council's action as a legal housecleaning, but MacDonald has
claimed that the BIA is trying to undermine tribal sovereignty.
   ``This happens in foreign countries, not the Navajo nation,''
said council delegate Anderson Tully of Teesto. ``They are copying
communistic countries.''
   John Chapela, a Window Rock attorney who claims to have gathered
37,000 signatures in a drive to recall MacDonald, has visited about
25 chapters to show the Senate videotapes.
   ``Mr. MacDonald is his own downfall,'' said Chapela, whom
MacDonald has fired from three tribal positions. He said MacDonald
is ``our best salesman of the need for a constitution'' that would
ensure accountability and spell out procedures for removing leaders.
   MacDonald rejects a constitution as ``an Anglo form of
government.'' And Haskie said tailoring a constitution to tribal
needs would ``require extensive discussion, debates and public
hearings.''
   Meanwhile, the uncertainty continues.
   Paula Martin, director of the Navajo ethics office, said she
believes many people remain neutral about MacDonald, with few
recognizing Haskie as a legitimate successor.
   ``I think there should be a new election for chairman,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Saab 9000 CD Is Impressive Roadholder</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Saab's new flagship model, the 1989 9000 CD, is an impressive
roadholder.
   A fine suspension package helps it handle curves and winding
stretches with ease. A turbocharged, 16-valve four-cylinder engine
helps the car tackle even mountain roads with zest. Antilock brakes
make sudden stops uneventful. And attention to ergonomic detail
inside takes the weariness out of travel.
   Saab can be proud of this, its first U.S. offering of a sedan
and one of the largest among European sedans sold here. The 9000 CD
is new, yet still Saabish in that it continues the Saab tradition
of performance and practicality.
   For example, the test car _ with five-speed manual transmission
_ got 24.6 miles per gallon, a surprisingly good show of
practicality considering the maneuvers it went through. The
four-cylinder engine was thrifty, but the turbocharger contributed
plenty of zip. The powerplant is the same as the one in the 9000
Turbo.
   ``We have been taken to task for not going to six- or
eight-cylinders like some other Europeans, but we think that with
the 16-valve four-cylinder and turbocharger, we have the best of
both worlds,'' said Jim Ventrilio, Saab spokesman. ``Saab boasts
that the engine has the potential to not only surpass 130 miles per
hour but to cruise at such speeds without complaint literally for
days on end.''
   Handling was enjoyable, with good traction and agile
performance. Saab engineers its 9000s so 60 percent of the weight
is over the front-drive wheels for stable maneuvering. The 9000 CD
has the same, rounded styling in front that also is a Saab
hallmark. But the rear is decidedly new. For this new model, the
automaker added six more inches in length to its 9000 Turbo
hatchback and put in a large, flat trunk with 19.8 cubic feet
capacity.
   The trunk lid pulls up easily, and you don't have to heave items
up and over the car body. Behind the rear seat armrest is a small
door that can be opened to allow long items, such as skis to pass
through and be carried inside the auto.
   ``We felt there was a market for (a sedan) in this country,
looking at the BMWs and Mercedes,'' Ventrilio said. Other
competitiors include the Audi 200 and Volvo 760 series, he said.
   The test 9000 CD had leather interior, so the base price was
nearly $32,000. Standard features included sunroof, anti-theft
alarm, and AM-FM stereo-cassette with seven-band graphic equalizer.
   Fit and finish inside and out was superb. The front seats were
immensely comfortable, having been orthopedically shaped for
support without causing drowsiness or muscle tension.
   The front seats also were heated, had eight-way power adjustment
and lumbar support. The dashboard was easy to read _ no digital
stuff here. Even the clock was the traditional model with hands.
   The interior was spacious, although a 6-foot-2 fellow complained
his head brushed the roof when he sat in the back seat. But legroom
was clearly adequate, and the car could carry five in fine style.
   Saab also has nice touches. The company put red lights at the
opening of the seat belt fasteners so they are easier to find at
night. The center console storage space had a subtle green light
inside, not a glaring, bright one. And all the knobs in the
instrument panel are rounded, so there's no protruding, dangerous
elements in a crash. Saab has one of the highest owner loyalty
records in the industry.
   ``Our dealers tell us they've been selling to some of the same
people for the last 20 years,'' Ventrilio said. Buyers typically
are males in their early 40s. They are highly affluent and college
educated, according to Ventrilio.
   It looks as if the 9000 CD could bring in even more buyers as
the company looks to expand in the West and Sunbelt. Ventrilio said
since the 9000 CDs were available in decent quantities starting in
January, the cars outsold their sibling, the 9000 hatchback models
for each of the first three months of 1989.
   In total, 879 of the 9000 CDs were sold in the period, and
Ventrilio says the company plans to import 4,700 this year.
Consumer Reports magazine has no rating on the new model but ranked
the 1986 9000 Turbo average in owner reports of trouble. The 1987
model ranked worse than average.

<HEAD>Roxana Zal Plays Jessica McClure's Mother in ABC Movie</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Roxana Zal says she formed a quick friendship
with Cissy McClure after playing the young mother in the ABC movie
``Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure.''
   ``We were very excited to meet each other,'' said Zal. ``It was
strange at first. A little awkward. Then we got along great. I
think we formed a bond. We write to each other. We're keeping in
touch.
   ``Neither of us had any walls up. We both wanted to help each
other. Jessica took to me, too. She climbed right up on my lap.''
   The two-hour movie, airing Sunday on ABC, is about the rescue of
18-month-old Jessica after she fell down an abandoned well near her
home in Midland, Texas, on Oct. 14, 1987. She was trapped 19 feet
underground in a space only eight inches wide.
   ``It's a real ensemble movie,'' said Zal. ``It shows how the
whole town came together to save the life of this child.''
   Zal said she had talked to Cissy McClure several times on the
telephone before she started the role. ``I think it was better that
I didn't see her until afterward,'' she said. ``I would have been
nervous if she'd been on the set. We tried to make it as accurate
as possible, but there may have been a few dramatic changes.''
   The movie also stars Beau Bridges as Police Chief Richard Czech,
Pat Hingle as Fire Chief James Roberts, Patty Duke as Carolyn
Henry, the victims' assistance volunteer who helped the McClures,
and Will Oldham as Chip McClure, Jessica's father.
   The movie was filmed largely on location in Bellflower, a city
about 12 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles.
   ``They made it look just like the original site,'' said Zal.
``Rodney Wunsch, the reporter from KMID-TV who plays himself, said
it was so similar it brought back all those terrible thoughts.''
   Zal, who won an Emmy in 1984 for her role in ``Something About
Amelia,'' said she had followed the story of Jessica McClure and
was interested when her agent called about the offer.
   ``My first thought, however, was that it might be difficult,''
she said. ``Some films based on news events sound great, but the
scripts don't always work out. I knew it would be difficult to turn
those 56 hours into a good movie. But the script turned out well,
and I liked it. I like the role, too, because I get to play a
mother. I've always played daughters and teen-agers before.''
   Zal worked on the role while continuing her studies as a
second-year student at UCLA.
   ``I'm studying world arts and cultures,'' she said. ``I switched
from theater arts. I get dance, music, art history and
anthropology. My theater major had too many technical classes and
labs. You had to take all the production courses first before you
got to the fun stuff. I'm more interested in acting, directing and
playwriting. I'm trying to develop my writing skills.''
   Her most recent project was ``Goodbye, Miss 4th of July'' for
the Disney Channel. It was based on the true story of Niki Janus, a
member of a Greek immigrant family who fought back against
discrimination by the Ku Klux Klan in West Virginia in 1917. The
movie also starred Chris Sarandon, Chantal Contouri and Louis
Gossett Jr.
   She made her film debut as Jon Voight's daughter in ``Table for
Five.''
   She was also in ``Testament,'' ``River's Edge,'' the CBS
Schoolbreak Special ``God, The Universe and Hot Fudge Sundaes'' and
played the daughter of an alcoholic in the ABC movie ``Shattered
Spirits.''
   ``After the commercial I was in a pilot,'' she said. ``Then I
decided I didn't want to do a series and prayed it would not go. I
really don't want to do a series. I wouldn't be able to go to
college if I was in a series.
   ``I started acting when I was 11. I'd wanted to start when I was
8, but my parents wouldn't let me. Finally an aunt told them to let
me try it or I'd grow up resenting them. I can pick and choose my
roles. My parents have provided very well for me and I don't have
to take anything just to pay the bills.''
   She said she was considering several things for the summer.
``It's so hard to find a good script and the competition is so
tough,'' she said. ``That's why it's good to be in school. I'm not
just sitting around waiting for the telephone to ring.''

   Drug abuse has been very, very good to Gregory
Lousig-Nont.
   So has theft.
   Lousig-Nont has built a career out of finding people who steal
and use drugs _ and helping prospective employers steer clear of
them.
   With a doctorate in industrial psychology, Lousig-Nont has
developed a series of tests he says help companies screen job
applicants based on their own admissions of attitudes and behavior.
   Last year Lousig-Nont &amp; Associates Inc. sold 300,000 honesty
tests, and business is booming.
   ``There's been a tremendous influx this year because of the
anti-polygraph legislation,'' he said, referring to a recent law
that bans most private employers' use of lie detector tests.
   With sales exceeding $1 million last year, Lousig-Nont's
business has grown at an annual average of 57 percent since he
began selling a comparatively crude version of his now-patented
honesty tests in 1978. He predicts sales will double by 1990.
   Lousig-Nont was a police officer in Peoria, Ill., in the 1970s
when he developed a reputation for interrogating suspects by using
a low-key, straightforward approach. His 95 percent confession rate
made him a stand-out, he said in an interview.
   ``I was sort of blown away by the fact that if I asked someone a
question, they'd usually give you the answer,'' he said. ``If they
lied to you, they became so guilty looking and would start pulling
at their collar or something that it was obvious.''
   It was that same approach that led him to develop the tests now
used by companies nationwide.
   Persistently surprised at how much people would tell him if he
asked, Lousig-Nont's first test contained 100 true-false questions.
Since then it has been refined and now is laced with what
Lousig-Nont called ``control'' questions to help determine whether
the applicant is generally truthful.
   He said the tests provide an assessment of a prospective
employee by measuring his or her ``propensity to become involved in
job dishonesty.''
   The tests, available in English and Spanish, sell for between $6
and $15 each, including the cost of an evaluation analysis by
Lousig-Nont's company. It is substantially cheaper than a urine
test to detect drug use.
   Now 40 and a millionaire, Lousig-Nont is one of a few
individuals who can go up against much larger test marketers such
as Stanton Corp., London House and Reid Psychological Systems.
   His tests have been used by National Convenience Stores, Radio
Shack and Wackenhut Corp., the national security firm, which has
certain rights to market the tests.
   Wackenhut has ``intros into a lot of companies I couldn't get my
foot in the door,'' Lousig-Nont said.
   Lousig-Nont's next project, he said, is to develop a personality
profile that will help determine whether an individual is suited
for a particular job. For example, an accountant doesn't have to be
an extrovert, but the trait certainly is useful for a publicist.

   We know Virginia Woolf the writer, who gave us
such ground-breaking novels as ``To the Lighthouse,'' ``Mrs.
Dalloway'' and ``The Waves.''
   We know Virginia Woolf the feminist, who wrote the influential
essay ``A Room of One's Own,'' and Virginia Woolf the pacifist, who
created ``Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid.''
   We know Virginia Woolf the diarist, who logged the minutiae of
her tortured life, and Virginia Woolf the suicide, who put a heavy
stone in her pocket and waded into the River Ouse.
   But until now we have known very little about the Virginia Woolf
who was sexually abused throughout her youth. A noted Woolf
scholar, Louise DeSalvo, provides us with the first complete
portrait of that woman in ``Virginia Woolf: The Impact of Childhood
Sexual Abuse on Her Life and Work'' (Beacon Press, $22.95).
   That Woolf had been abused was no secret _ she talked about it
in speeches, letters, conversations and memoirs. But previous
biographers have virtually ignored its impact on her life, treating
it as an aberration in an otherwise happy Victorian household or
perhaps even a hallucination of her ``madness.''
   DeSalvo, a professor of English at Hunter College of the City
University of New York, is the first academician to thoroughly
examine the abuse in light of modern-day research on incest
survivors.
   ``It's not as if it was hidden as a topic in any of the
biographies that have come before,'' DeSalvo said in a recent
interview at her Hunter office. ``But the major change is that in
the last 10 years the work on incest and child abuse as a field has
been so monumental that it enabled someone like me to use that work
and to read her life in the context of what we now know the effect
of incest and child abuse are.''
   A brief outline of Virginia Woolf's family and the abuse
suffered, based on Woolf's diaries, letters and recorded
conversations with others:
   Julia Duckworth and Sir Leslie Stephen, Virginia Woolf's
parents, had each been married before they wed in 1878. Gerald,
Stella and George Duckworth were children of Julia's previous
marriage; Laura Stephen was a child of Sir Leslie's first marriage.
Julia and Leslie Stephen had four children together: Vanessa,
Thoby, Virginia and Adrian.
   Woolf's mother died when she was 13 and about that time her half
brother, George, 14 years her senior, began sexually molesting her
and her sister, Vanessa. The abuse continued until Woolf was in her
early 20s and stopped only when she had a nervous breakdown after
her father died and the household was broken up. Stella, Woolf's
half sister who took over the running of the household after their
mother's death, may have become Sir Leslie's lover after his wife
died.
   Late in her life, Woolf, in a period of intense self-analysis
while writing her autobiography, suddenly remembered an incident
that had apparently been repressed of being molested by her other
half brother, Gerald, when she was 6, in which he broke her hymen.
DeSalvo thinks Woolf was devastated by the realization that the
abuse began far earlier than she had believed.
   There is plenty of other evidence of the household as a
dysfunctional family: Woolf had an erotic relationship with her
sister, Vanessa, that lasted into their 20s; Woolf's half sister,
Laura, whom the family considered mentally deficient, was locked up
in a distant room in the house for years before being trundled off
to an asylum; Woolf's brother, Thoby, threw himself out of a window
when he was 15; Woolf had an affair with Vanessa's husband; after
her divorce, Vanessa took up with the homosexual lover of her
brother Adrian. The list of family entanglements goes on and on and
continues into the next generation.
   DeSalvo reread everything that Woolf wrote _ every novel, diary,
letter, essay and fragment that has been preserved in the United
States and Great Britain _ and isolated every reference to Woolf's
childhood or her fictional depictions of children.
   ``It was when I did that that it was all thrown into stark
relief, and I saw what she was trying to say,'' said DeSalvo.
   Once she learned how incest survivors talk about their
experiences, DeSalvo said Woolf's sometimes puzzling language
suddenly made sense. In a letter to Vanessa's husband, for example,
Woolf writes almost flippantly about the sexual abuse the two
suffered. DeSalvo said that is an example of ``inappropriate
response'' that victims of incest often use as a defense mechanism.
   ``The key to my own beginning to be able to figure it out was
learning what the language of incest survivors is, learning the
verbal strategies. How survivors of incest tend to create inflated
pictures of their parents. ...
   ``I couldn't figure out, for example, for the longest time why
Woolf wrote these revered portraits of her father. If you take them
straight, that's one thing, but if you read how incest survivers
typically talk about the family constellation, it makes an enormous
amount of sense.''
   One of the points DeSalvo makes in her book is that some of the
symptoms of the bouts of ``madness'' Woolf suffered throughout her
life _ depression, nervousness, irritability, tantrums _ are likely
responses to the sexual abuse rather than the congenital condition
it is often treated as.
   DeSalvo was asked whether she ever thought Woolf, with her
history of instability, was perhaps an ``unreliable narrator.'' The
memory of the abuse by Gerald when she was 6, for example, did not
surface until Woolf was in her 50s. Can her memory be trusted?
   ``One of the biggest issues that always comes up in incestuous
abuse is the extent to which people falsify memories. The paradigm
used to be Freudian (the theory that patients' reports of sexual
abuse were figments of their imaginations and based on desire). ...
All the recent work that has been done on incest survivors suggest
rather the opposite _ that any memories are authentic, and the
reason experts say this is that it is so disastrous, even today, to
be labeled an incest survivor that no one would falsify that.''
   DeSalvo is the editor of ``Melymbrosia,'' an early version of
Woolf's novel ``The Voyage Out,'' which she constructed from
manuscripts, and co-editor with Mitchell Leaska of ``Vita
Sackville-West's Letters to Virginia Woolf.'' She has also written
a book on Nathaniel Hawthorne.
   DeSalvo's new book, as disturbing as the subject matter is,
should be heralded for both its painstakingly thorough research and
the delicate and fair handling of such a sensitive subject. This is
a scholarly, not a titillating work. At the same time, it is
enormously readable and imbued with the fascination and admiration
that DeSalvo has for one of the greatest writers of this century.

   The New York Stock Exchange will implement
computerized off-hours trading if companies and investment firms
want it, but no such demand exists now, says the chairman of the
Big Board.
   John J. Phelan Jr. said Tuesday there has been no interest among
New York stock market participants to extend trading at the world's
second-largest exchange beyond the current 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
hours.
   ``The reason we have not done it is that our customers have said
they don't want it,'' Phelan told a meeting of the Society of
American Business Editors and Writers.
   But, he added, ``If there is any sign of interest out there at
all we will try at least some off-hours trading.''
   In 1986, the NYSE surveyed securities brokerages and companies
listed on the exchange, Phelan said, and ``99 percent of all those
people said, `For God's sake, don't do it. We are not interested in
that now.'''
   The 197-year-old NYSE, second in size to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, recently announced it would meet with customers, traders,
institutional investors, listed companies and securities firms to
re-gauge demand for off-hours trading.
   Under such a system, securities theoretically can be bought and
sold when the exchange floor is shut down via computers that
automatically match buyers and sellers from points around the world.
   The tiny Cincinnati Stock Exchange last month announced plans to
start computerized 24-hour trading in the next 19 months. Chicago's
two futures markets also have announced they are developing
after-hours trading systems.
   Phelan played down fears expressed by some securities industry
experts that markets in foreign countries could siphon away
business from New York. He said the idea of a global market had not
yet taken hold, and that overseas ``there's more potential than
actual'' competition.
   ``Global markets and 24-hour markets, despite all the trendy
talk, are not there because the customers don't want them,'' he
said.
   ``In the off-hours market there's not going to be a heck of a
lot of orders,'' he added. ``Most pension funds are not going to
wait until two o'clock in the morning to make a trade. The major
pool of liquidity is going to be when this market opens.''
   But Phelan conceded that Japanese investors buying more stock in
American companies listed on the Tokyo exchange could some day pose
a threat. He said 90 U.S. companies currently trade in Tokyo.
   ``It's new money that's never been in this market before.
European money has been in this market for years. Japan's money has
never been in this market,'' he said.

   Jurors at the securities fraud trial of Singer
Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian are getting a short course in
corporate takeovers, tender offers and other Wall Street
terminology.
   Before defense and prosecution lawyers began their opening
statements to the jury Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward
took 10 minutes to explain to the jurors a number of financial
terms that will come up repeatedly during the trial.
   The education was to continue today with a securities law expert
expected to be the first government witness.
   In his opening statement Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney David
E. Brodsky claimed that in 1985 and 1986, when he emerged on the
corporate takeover scene, Bilzerian ``sought to build a reputation
for himself as a corporate raider'' through a series of lies.
   ``He lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he lied to
the Internal Revenue Service and he lied to the investing public,''
Brodsky told the jury at federal court in Manhattan.
   ``In the past his lies brought him lots of money,'' said
Brodsky, pointing at Bilzerian. ``Today they bring him to the bar
of justice.''
   Bilzerian, 38, of Tampa, Fla., is accused of conspiracy,
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986.
   Ward dismissed one felony count last month but 11 other counts
remain.
   None of the charges involves Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover
of Singer last year after a lengthy struggle.
   Brodsky said another prosecution witness would be former West
Coast stockbroker Boyd Jefferies, who was implicated by convicted
stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky, pleaded guilty to violating
securities laws in 1987 and has turned government informant.
   The indictment alleges that Jefferies secretly held stock for
Bilzerian in four unsuccessful takeover transactions involving
Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Hammerhill Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co.,
and Armco Inc.
   The ruse allegedly was used to help Bilzerian secretly
accumulate large stock positions in companies he later would
attempt to take over.
   But defense attorney Arthur Mathews contended his client was on
trial because ``Mr. Brodsky's bosses made a dumb deal with an
admitted felon,'' Jefferies.
   Mathews, who did not mention Boesky by name, theorized that
Jefferies _ in order to avoid more serious charges _ ``implicated a
few scapegoats,'' including Bilzerian, because he had no higher-ups
on whom to inform.
   ``The government is straining to try and justify the bad bargain
they made,'' said Mathews.
   If convicted, Bilzerian faces a maximum penalty of five years in
jail and a $250,000 fine on each count.

   A marathon bargaining session led to an agreement
in principle between AMR Corp. and the Transport Workers Union on a
new contract, averting a threatened strike at American Airlines,
the nation's largest carrier.
   Neither side released details of the pact Tuesday, except a
brief company statement that said union and management officials
believe ``the agreement benefits both the company and the union and
will enable American to continue the growth plan that has made the
airline an industry leader.''
   The statement by Fort Worth-based AMR said the agreement was
reached after a 27-hour bargaining session. Details were withheld
pending ``agreement on final language and ratification.''
   The airline and union, which represents about 23,000 of the
company's 67,000 employees, submitted to mediation after American's
proposed $610 million four-year contract was rejected in March.
   The rejected contract guaranteed raises for all employees,
ranging from about 28 percent over four years to about 100 percent
during the contract. However, the union objected to American's
two-tier wage scale, under which it takes new employees 12 years to
reach top pay. The union wanted that reduced to five years.
   In addition, there were complaints that even with the increases,
American mechanics and ground service employees would not be the
industry's highest-paid.
   Also at issue was the company's plan to have employees pay $10
per person _ and up to $30 per family _ toward health insurance
each month. The company now pays the entire premium.
   The mediation continued daily from its April 14 beginning until
Friday, when the parties took a two-day break before resuming
Sunday, said Ed Koziatek, the TWU's international vice president
for American.
   Airline officials have complained that the contract suffered
from union politics as several locals were conducting election
campaigns while the pact was up for ratification in March.
   The four-year pact became amendable on March 1, but was rejected
12,143-to-5,140. However under the federal Railway Labor Act,
transportation contracts do not expire until after a lengthy
process that involves mediation, followed by a 30-day cooling-off
period should the mediator declare an impasse in the negotiations.
   The TWU represents the airline's mechanics, bag handlers, ground
crews, stock clerks, guards, meteorologists and aircraft cleaners.
   American had its most profitable year ever last year, with those
profits sustained through the first three months of this year.
   AMR posted 1988 net income of $476.8 million, a 140.3 percent
increase from 1987 and 37.9 percent higher than the previous record
of $345.8 million in 1985.
   The company reported a first-quarter profit of $101 million, a
47.7 percent jump from 1988's first three months. Operating
revenues were $2.45 billion.

   Polaroid Corp. Chairman William J. McCune Jr. is
outlining the evolution of Polaroid Corp. from its beginnings to
its head-to-head competition with Eastman Kodak Co. in a lawsuit
against the photographic giant.
   Polaroid struggled to keep Kodak out of the instant photography
field and now says in the federal suit that Kodak should pay $12
billion in damages for infringing on its patents.
   In the first day of testimony Tuesday in U.S. District Court,
McCune said Polaroid and Kodak had a productive working
relationship for decades. But things soured in the late 1960s, he
said, when Polaroid was working on its revolutionary SX-70 camera.
   Kodak, which for years had manufactured film for Polaroid, was
asked to produce the new, complex negative that Polaroid had
developed for the instant, color camera. But Kodak demanded a
license from Polaroid, which would have allowed Kodak to develop
its own instant photography, said McCune, who was to resume his
testimony today.
   ``There was considerable reluctance to undertake the project
unless we gave them license,'' McCune said under questioning by
Polaroid attorney Herbert Schwartz. ``A stumbling block was always
that we couldn't see how giving Kodak a license to make products
competitive with ours would allow us to stay in business.''
   Polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities
in Massachusetts.
   Instant photography, McCune said, ``is all our bread and butter
and that's everything we've got.''
   McCune's testimony before Judge A. David Mazzone ranged widely
from the origins of instant photography after World War II to the
introduction of the SX-70 camera in 1972.
   An earlier federal court decision already established that Kodak
infringed on Polaroid patents. The remaining question is how much
Kodak owes for that violation.
   Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak says it should pay $177 million,
equal to 5 percent royalties on the instant cameras and film Kodak
sold from 1976 until 1985.
   McCune said the story began during the war, when Polaroid
founder Edwin Land was in Santa Fe on a family trip. ``He took
photographs of his daughter and she asked why she couldn't see it
right away,'' McCune said. ``He wondered too.''
   By 1963, with manufacturing help from Kodak, Polaroid developed
the first color instant photography.
   ``The business grew rapidly in that period,'' McCune said.
Revenue of $129 million in 1963 jumped to $571 million in 1972.
Polaroid's profits after taxes increased from $25 million to $75
million in that time.
   With the introduction of the SX-70, McCune said, Polaroid hoped
for a dramatic increase in its business.
   ``We viewed it as a revolutionary step and thought it was going
to dramatically increase the business of the company and increase
the life of the business,'' McCune said.
   But as Polaroid's lawyers have argued, Kodak's competition
starting in 1976 cut into profits and forced Polaroid to sell some
cameras below cost.
   If Mazzone awards Polaroid anything close to $12 billion, it
will be the largest patent infringement decision in history, far
surpassing the record $207 million that Smith International Inc.
was ordered to pay Hughes Tool Co. three years ago for copying
drill bit technology.

   U.S. pork producers say they will at
least get temporary relief from Canadian competition as a result of
a ruling by the U.S. Commerce Department on an industry complaint
about subsidized Canadian exports.
   The government said Tuesday it will place a preliminary duty of
about 3 cents a pound on Canadian shipments of fresh, chilled and
frozen pork products to the United States.
   The duty, in the form of a bond to be posted by importers, will
take effect Friday and last until a final decision is announced
sometime in the fall.
   If U.S. pork producers prevail, the bond will go into the U.S.
Treasury and a permanent duty will be imposed. If the Canadians
prevail, the money will be returned.
   But in the meantime, the bond requirements will make it more
expensive to ship pork products from Canada to the United States.
   ``Hopefully, that will slow down the surge of pork products
coming in,'' said Dave Mehlhaff, a spokesman for the National Pork
Producers Council.
   The Des Moines-based council said shipments of such products
have increased by more than 50 percent since 1984 and totaled about
470 million pounds last year. It said a University of Missouri
study indicates the subsidized competition cost U.S. pork producers
$697 million in 1988, and that the cost to meatpackers was even
greater.
   The pork producers have said the Canadian government was paying
its producers a subsidy of $19.50 a hog in the third quarter of
1988 and that it rose to $31 a hog in the fourth quarter.
   The ruling was the second in a series of decisions in the case.
The International Trade Commission issued its preliminary finding
of subsidized competition in February.
   The Commerce Department will hold a June 28 hearing and issue a
final decision by July 17, said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. The
International Trade Commission then will have 45 days to determine
whether the imports materially injure or threaten injury to the
U.S. pork industry.
   Don Gingerich of Parnell, president of the pork council, said he
was delighted the government is interpreting the figures in the
same way as the industry.
   ``These imports of pork products coming out of Canada, which
have increased so dramatically since we put the countervailing
duties on live animals, has really plagued our industry as far as
the profits we are able to maintain from our herds,'' Gingerich
said.

   The U.S. dollar was trading in a narrow, mostly
higher band in Europe late this morning, supported by bullish
sentiment but checked by fear of central bank intervention,
currency dealers said.
   Gold prices slipped.
   Trading was thinned by a national holiday in Japan and an
approaching holiday in Europe where many markets will close
Thursday for Ascension Day.
   Traders said there were concerns the central banks would step
back into the market, following Tuesday's joint action in which
they reportedly sold $300 million to $400 million.
   Markets were closed in Japan today for Constitution Day. In
London, the dollar was quoted at 134.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8896 West German marks, up from 1.8875; 1.6820
Swiss francs, up from 1.6805; 6.3865 French francs, up from 6.3735;
2.1320 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1270; 1,382.75 lire, up from
1,379.50; 1.1815 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1830
   In London, the British pound fell slightly to $1.6838 from
$1.6845 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at $376 a troy ounce, down from $377.50
bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $376.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $376.60, down from $377.30 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 63 cents to close at a bid
$377.55.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.62 a troy
ounce, down from Tuesday's $5.65.

   Share prices were weaker at midday Wednesday, amid
continued lack of interest among institutional investors.
   At about 12:15 p.m., the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 10.7 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,092.4,
just 0.1 point above its lowest level. At its best, the index was
down 3.7 points at midmorning.
   By midday, 234.7 million shares had changed hands, compared with
166 million shares at the same time Tuesday.
   ``It's an extremely dull day. There just isn't anything going
on,'' said one equities salesman.
   But there also was a distinct lack of selling pressure, he noted.
   ``It's more a case of lethargy than anything else,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nevadans Approve Tax To Cash In On Gold Bonanza</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nevadans overwhelmingly approved a $52
million tax on miners who are now unearthing a gold bonanza that
rivals production during this state's famed Comstock Lode era.
   Voters also approved a plan to double the money Nevada can
borrow for new construction.
   With all votes counted in Tuesday's special election, the
two-year mining tax hike won 107,679 to 30,663. The other question
won by 74,418 to 63,228.
   Voter turnout was a low 36 percent. Election officials around
the state had predicted turnouts ranging from 30 percent to 40
percent of the more than 383,000 people eligible to vote.
   Nevada is the nation's leading producer of gold. During the past
eight years, mines here have produced more than 12 million troy
ounces of gold with a value of about $5 billion.
   At today's prices, that's equal to the value of all the gold and
silver unearthed in Virginia City during the two-decade Comstock
Lode era that began in the late 1850s.
   The mining tax plan was submitted to voters after bitter debate
in which Democratic Gov. Bob Miller accused mining industry
lobbyists of deceit in trying to derail his proposal for $118
million.
   The industry accused him of playing ``mine games.'' Miller
responded that the industry was trying to give the state ``the mine
shaft.''
   Casino owners, often targeted for tax hikes because gaming is
Nevada's largest industry, also got into the fray, arguing that
it's time to change the tradition in which the mining industry did
not pay its fair share of taxes.
   After Miller's plan was rejected in the Senate, the $52 million
plan was endorsed by most of the people who had fought over any
higher payments.
   Miller joined in an advertising campaign with mining industry
leaders to say that without approval, the state would face fiscal
chaos.
   Had the measure lost, the leaders said, the Legislature would
have needed to remain in session an extra month to slash budgets
and raise taxes.
   ``I think it's a positive thing for the state to have these
revenues available,'' Miller said late Tuesday. He added he planned
to meet with legislative leaders before deciding whether any more
tax revenues are needed from the miners.
   Assemblyman Marvin Sedway, Democratic chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, had opposed the $52 million plan.
   ``The amount they would be paying is just a drop in the bucket
to what they should be paying,'' said Sedway. ``It (gold) is a
non-renewable resource, and will be gone forever.''
   The measure allows the state to impose a 5 percent tax on the
net proceeds of mines during the next two years. The question
resulted from an agreement during the 1987 Legislature between the
mining industry, lawmakers and then-Gov. Dick Bryan.
   Jim Gourdie, president of the Nevada Mining Association, said he
hoped passage would end this year's tax raising efforts in the
Legislature.
   ``I'm delighted with the outcome,'' he said. ``I think the
people have realized this is a reasonable and fair tax.''

<HEAD>Bush Gets Tougher S&amp;L Standards in Banking Panel Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is getting everything he wanted
and more from the House Banking Committee to prevent S&amp;Ls from
tapping the taxpayers for another bailout, but only in exchange for
new low-income housing initiatives.
   On a 49-2 vote just before midnight Tuesday, the committee
approved Bush's $90 billion savings and loan plan _ the largest
financial bailout in the nation's history _ after spending four
days toughening capital standards on the industry and adding a pair
of housing components.
   Only Reps. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, voted
no. Kennedy said the bill did not have enough housing support for
the poor and complained about the panel's rejection of his
provisions attacking lending discrimination. Leach said he wanted
still tougher capital standards.
   As it now stands, the House bill would require the nation's
3,000 thrifts to put up at least $20 billion in new capital over
the next five years _ twice as much as a version approved by the
Senate two weeks ago _ to fulfill Bush's promise of ``Never again.''
   It also would divorce what critics had called a too-cozy
relationship between S&amp;L regulators and the industry and devote $75
million a year to investigating and prosecuting fraud that is
blamed for a major portion of the crisis.
   On a party-line vote, committee Democrats overrode
administration objections to set aside some of the property the
government is inheriting from failed S&amp;Ls for low-income housing.
They also voted to require the industry to subsidize below-market
mortgage rates for low-income families.
   Still, the overall package won praise from the administration.
   ``This committee exceeded everyone's expectations,'' Assistant
Treasury Secretary David Mullins said. ``They've achieved something
very close to what we asked for.''
   The biggest victory for the administration is a requirement that
S&amp;L owners over the next five years reach a level of having at
least $3 of their own money in ``tangible'' capital at risk for
every $100 they lend.
   ``We've moved legislation that will deal with a significant part
of the problem ... and passed tough capital standards _ better than
the Senate bill and, I would argue, better than the Bush bill as
well,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The bill still has to go through three other committees _
including one where the erection of a formidable roadblock is
anticipated later this month _ before a final vote by the full
House.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the banking committee's
chairman who spearheaded the administration's drive for the tougher
capital requirements, said industry lobbying efforts to weaken them
already have shifted there.
   And after that, new fights over the housing subsidies that were
rejected in the Senate as ``social engineering'' are expected to
erupt in a conference of leading lawmakers from both houses before
a final version is sent to Bush this summer for his approval or
veto.
   As proposed by Bush and now approved by both the House Banking
Committee and the Senate, the plan will pump $50 billion over the
next three years into a federal insurance fund to pay off
depositors whose money was lost through speculative and often
fraudulent lending by some 300 to 500 S&amp;Ls.
   Another $40 billion to cover the losses of institutions closed
in the past two years plus anticipated failures over the next
decade _ and also shore up the insurance fund _ will come largely
from new or increased fees on the industry.
   Altogether, the bailout costs _ including interest _ are
expected to total $157 billion by the year 2000 and $275 billion by
the year 2020.
   The government share will be raised through a complex financing
plan that keeps the problem off the federal budget and avoids a tax
increase, but at an interest cost to taxpayers of $150 billion to
$200 billion over the next 30 years.
   That arrangement is likely to be questioned at least one more
time by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, one of
three panels yet to review the package.
   However, the next big showdown will not occur until the bill
reaches the House Rules Committee, which controls what issues can
be revisited on the House floor.
   The rules panel's chairman, Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., said in
a letter last week he strongly opposes parts of the new capital
requirements.
   Industry and government records indicate that 14 S&amp;Ls in Florida
would have to raise a total of $700 million to $800 million in new
capital over the next five years or shrink in size.
   Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, said he expects the housing
provisions in the bill to be attacked on the House floor, along
with what he called one ``crystalizing amendment'' to stretch out
the implementation of the tougher capital standards.
   But he predicted the fights there will be few and short.
   ``Everybody in the country and the Congress realizes we need to
get this enacted and behind us,'' Bartlett said. ``The bill should
be signed by the president by the Fourth of July.''

<HEAD>Fed's Heller Sees Slower Growth, Steadying Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve's tight-fisted monetary
policy can curb inflation and prolong economic growth, but only if
business leaders exercise some patience, a central bank official
says.
   ``It takes time for monetary policy to relieve pressure on
prices,'' Federal Reserve board member H. Robert Heller told the
mid-year meeting of The Conference Board Tuesday. ``What is needed
now is a bit of patience to allow the policy that is in place to
work.''
   Heller, in a luncheon address to about 100 executives, said the
Fed is not out to take the ``proverbial punch bowl away.''
   ``We would just like everyone to drink a bit more slowly so that
the party can last a longer time.''
   Heller, who has been on the Federal Reserve's seven-member board
of governors since 1986, defended the tight rein the Fed has kept
on the nation's money supply this year.
   That monetary policy has forced interest rates up in an effort
to ease inflationary pressures by slowing business expansion.
   Recent economic data have indicated the economy is cooling down,
but the inflation picture is more clouded. Sharp rises in wholesale
and consumer prices earlier this year, along with a more recent
surge in oil and gasoline prices, have prompted some economists to
predict a new wave of strong inflation.
   The most pessimistic analysts see both recession and inflation
ahead.
   But Heller foresees neither.
   In general, he said, the overall outlook ``is for modified
growth and subdued inflationary tendencies.''
   ``Put simply, I just do not believe that the preconditions for a
sustained acceleration in inflation are now in place,'' he said.
   On the possibility of a recession, he added, ``the imbalances
which traditionally precede a recession are not visible and
indications are that the current expansion will continue.''
   And on the inflation front, he said a second year of drought in
the Corn Belt is unlikely and agricultural output should return to
normal this year, bringing down food prices.
   Despite the rise in crude oil prices from about $17 to more than
$20 a barrel since Jan. 1, ``recent history of the global oil
market suggests that prices beyond $20 a barrel will probably not
hold for long,'' Heller said.
   Although economic growth is slowing, he said, the vigorous pace
of corporate investment in plant and equipment expenditures is an
encouraging sign, as is the promise of a bipartisan congressional
agreement for the fiscal year 1990 federal budget.
   Reducing the federal budget deficit is essential for continued
economic growth, Heller said.
   ``Looking beyond the coming year, it is important that this
progress will be sustained in future years as well until fiscal
responsibility is again the norm.''
   The Conference Board is an international network of more than
20,000 senior business executives.

<HEAD>Helicopter Company Announces 450 Layoffs, More to Come</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. says a
slowdown in attack helicopter production is to blame for the
planned layoff of 450 workers this month, with about the same
number to follow next year.
   President Bill Brown said Tuesday that temporary and regular
employees in all divisions would be cut, including 355 at the
company's Mesa plant and 95 at its plant in Culver City, Calif.
   Brown said those affected would be told by May 12. They will
receive severance pay and help from the company in finding new
jobs, he said.
   The layoffs and budget cutbacks, which will include cuts in such
areas as advertising and marketing, are expected to save the
company about $16 million this year, Brown said.
   One of Arizona's largest defense contractors, McDonnell Douglas
has 5,000 employees at its plant in Mesa and another 3,000 in
Culver City.
   The company has been building about 10 AH-64 Apache attack
helicopters a month, but the Pentagon has ordered that rate cut
back to six a month beginning in June 1990.
   McDonnell Douglas has delivered about 460 Apaches on a contract
which called for 975. But President Bush said two weeks ago in
unveiling his defense cuts that the Army now wants only 807, a drop
of 168.
   It also builds the MD-500 series of light helicopters and a
variety of automatic cannons.
   ``Due to the two-year length of the production pipeline, we are
already feeling the dropoff in Apache labor required to build the
reduced number of helicopters,'' Brown said.
   The company may be forced to lay off another 450 employees in
Mesa and Culver City next year if efforts to further broaden the
company's business base fall short, Brown said.
   About 50 percent of the company's payroll has been based on
Apache sales, the company has said.
   Brown referred to ``encouraging signs that point toward Apache
sales as early as this year in Europe or the Middle East.''
   He said, however, no contracts had been signed.
   ``Nothing counts until someone signs on the dotted line,'' he
said.
   Supporters of the Apache contend that reductions in nuclear
weapons, particularly in Europe, have made the anti-tank helicopter
more important than ever.
   However, the Apache suffered a major setback earlier this year
when the commander of the Army's 82nd Aviation Brigade at Fort
Bragg, N.C., complained that it was unreliable. He said all 12 of
the Apaches in his unit were incapacitated at points during a war
exercise, and only five were in operating condition at the end.
   Brown denied there is a problem with the Apache's reliability,
emphasizing that difficulties experienced with keeping the
helicopter flying during war games and training were not safety
related.
   ``The Army has a shortfall of maintenance people,'' he said.
   Despite the layoffs, the company will continue to invest heavily
in research and development as it pursues development of new,
advanced, civilian and military helicopters, Brown said.
   ``We're not going to compromise our future,'' he said.
   McDonnell Douglas plans to hire about 100 engineers and
technical specialists this year to help with development of its
seven-passenger MDX commercial helicopter and the Army's proposed
LHX scout-attack helicopter.

   Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis has
agreed to put his hostile $2.7 billion bid for Northwest Airlines'
parent on hold in exchange for confidential information on the
nation's fourth-largest airline.
   Under an agreement announced Tuesday by the airline company and
Davis, the oilman's offer will remain outstanding but he will
postpone buying more NWA Inc. shares until June 30.
   Separately, the New York leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. indicated an interest in acquiring Northwest's
parent, NWA Inc., the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   KKR formally told Northwest of its interest in a bid, the
Journal reported, quoting unidentified people familiar with the
takeover battle. The notification came as part of a bidding
procedure NWA had set up in response to Davis's proxy challenge,
the Journal said.
   If KKR pursues a bid, it would be the firm's largest known
buyout effort since it bought RJR Nabisco Inc. for $25 billion in
February, according to the Journal.
   Spokesmen for KKR and NWA refused comment on KKR's apparent
interest, the newspaper said.
   KKR's disclosure came in response to a deadline set by NWA's
investment banker, First Boston Corp., the Journal said. Bidders
will next get access to confidential company data as well as
meetings with company management.
   In the the agreement reached Tuesday between Davis and
Northwest, Davis also agreed to stop soliciting shareholder proxies
in an attempt to unseat the company's board of directors at the
annual meeting set for May 15. Analysts generally agreed that it
may put Davis in an improved position.
   ``I would assume that he is no longer hostile. He's been folded
into the process,'' said analyst Kurt Rivard for Minneapolis-based
Dain Bosworth Inc.
   Earlier, the NWA board rejected Davis' $90-a-share offer as
financially inadequate.
   ``I think it puts him in a position to make an educated bid for
the company. He's going to have access to information he didn't
have before,'' Rivard said. ``Who knows? Mr. Davis may look at the
information and run away from the deal.''
   In a statement, NWA said, ``The agreement affords Mr. Davis the
opportunity to participate in NWA's process for exploring
alternatives designed to enhance stockholder value.
   ``Davis will be treated on an equal basis with all other bidders
in connection with the procedures which are established by NWA for
bids in connection with a possible sale of the company,'' added a
statement from Davis Acquisition, the company Davis formed to
acquire NWA.
   ``Davis will be permitted to make its best bid to the board of
directors for a negotiated acquisition after reviewing the
non-public information,'' Davis Acquisition said.
   But it doesn't mean Davis and NWA are on good terms, Rivard said.
   ``The psychology is he probably hasn't won any friends at
Northwest the way he has handled the deal. He's been aggressive,
aggressively hostile to the board,'' the analyst said.
   Davis said the restrictions will end immediately if NWA
announces the sale of the company or a non-sale alternative,
including no transaction at all, before June 30.
   Davis also said NWA agreed to give him 10 days notice if it
decides to pursue certain non-sale alternatives.
   NWA shares closed Tuesday at $101.75 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading, down 25 cents. The Davis accord was
announced after the market closed.
   From the beginning of the takeover battle, Northwest officials
said they were willing to accept queries from every potential
bidder willing to sign a confidentiality statement, Rivard said.
   ``I think effectively what it does is it takes Davis from the
outside and moves him to the inside,'' he said. As for NWA, Rivard
said, ``It saves them the proxy fight ... although I think it was a
long shot for Davis.''
   Under the agreement, all pending litigation between the parties
will be put on hold. But Davis said he will continue his action in
U.S. District Court in St. Paul to overturn a Thursday order by
state Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch that prohibits Minnesota
shareholders from selling their NWA shares to Davis.
   Under the state's anti-takeover law, Hatch has said Davis must
explain how he would operate the airline company in light of the
large sum he proposes to borrow to buy it.
   Davis has said he does not intend to sell the the airline's
strategic assets, reduce payroll or move the headquarters from
suburban Eagan, but his lawyers have indicated he may refinance or
sell NWA's Tokyo real estate, reduce travel agent commissions or
change Northwest's in-flight service.
   Davis contends disclosure of his specific plans for operating
the airline, as Hatch requested, would put him at a competitive
disadvantage with other suitors.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 90 countries agreed today to
support a ban on ozone-destroying chemicals by the year 2000, but
they split over how to help Third World countries pay for safer
technology.
   Delegates from 86 countries and nearly 100 non-governmental
organizations at the U.N.-sponsored conference adopted a resolution
calling for industrial countries to help developing nations replace
equipment emitting harmful chlorofluorocarbons. But it made no
specific funding proposals.
   Mostafa K. Tolba, head of the U.N. Environment Program, proposed
an international climate fund to help Third World countries comply
with the program to phase out chemicals that deplete the earth's
shield of ozone.
   But industrial countries led by Britain, the United States and
Canada objected, favored a bilateral approach.
   British Environment Minister Nicholas Ridley dismissed Tolba's
idea as ``simplistic.''
   ``It has not been suggested who would run such a fund, how it
would operate, on what criteria its funds would be raised, and from
whom, and what would happen if they did not contribute,'' Ridley
told the conference.
   Norway, the only country to make a solid proposal, offered to
contribute 0.1 percent of its gross national income _ about $88
million _ to the climate fund, if other industrial nations do the
same.
   Tolba suggested a working group from the 48 countries that
ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol draw up a specific funding plan
and submit it next year.
   While politicians discussed finances, scientists questioned
whether alternatives are at hand to replace the most harmful
chemicals _ the chlorofluorocarbons used for refrigeration,
insolvents and other industrial processes.
   Kevin J. Fay, of the Alliance for Responsible Chlorofluorocarbon
Policy, said the Montreal Protocol was based on the assumption the
chemicals could be substituted by hydrochlorofluorocarbons and
other new and presumably safer variations. The new compounds are
the best known replacements, but ``we don't know enough about
them,'' Fay told reporters.
   ``They cannot be used until we have the answers to questions for
their safety for the environment,'' said Fay, whose alliance is a
coalition of hundreds of U.S. industries cooperating in the search
for alternatives.
   ``There's no way that the deadlines can be met'' if the new
chemicals are found to be unusable, he said.
   Non-governmental organizations said Tuesday's declaration ``does
not go far enough,'' according to David Doniger of the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Washington. They called for a ``crash
program'' to eliminate the chemicals by 1995.
   The four-day conference, the First Meeting of the Parties to the
Montreal Protocol, was to update the 1987 document requiring
signatories to halve by 1999 their production of five
chlorofluorocarbons and three halons, which break down ozone and
increase the risk of skin cancers and eye disease.
   Annual chlorofluorocarbon production is 1.14 million tons,
two-thirds of which is produced by the United States and Western
Europe. Japan produces 12 percent and the Soviet Union about 10
percent.

<HEAD>Reports 7 Percent Drop In Quarterly Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spiegel Inc., the nation's largest
mail-order retailer, Wednesday reported its first-quarter profit
fell 7.4 percent, largely due to the costs of acquiring Eddie Bauer
Inc. and Honeybee Inc.
   The Oak Brook-based company said its after-tax income totaled
$6.34 million, or 12 cents a share, in the three months ended March
31, down from $6.85 million, or 15 cents a share, for the same
period a year before.
   Revenue for the quarter amounted to $324.5 million, a 37 percent
increase over $236.7 million in the first quarter of 1988.
   Operating income rose 13 percent, to $24.2 million from $21.4
million, Spiegel said in an prepared announcement about its
financial results.
   The company said it paid about $6 million, before taxes, in
interest during the quarter to finance its purchases of Eddie
Bauer, a mail-order sportswear and outdoor-equipment company, and
Honeybee, a chain of women's apparel stores.
   Both acquisitions were announced in 1988.
   John J. Shea, Spiegel's president and chief executive, said the
company's profit margin on net sales rose to 33.2 percent from 32.7
percent in 1988's first quarter. He attributed the improvement to a
lower level of goods sold at marked-down prices, a result of better
inventory management.
   ``The outlook for the coming months is promising,'' Shea stated.
``Apparel sales have strengthened and home furnishings remain
strong. We are well-positioned to continue to fulfill our
customers' needs in both of these areas.''

<HEAD>America West Offering To Buy Eastern Shuttle, Other Assets</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf with 2 grafs of Trump comment.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines Inc. said today it has
submitted a proposal to buy Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle and
10 Boeing 757 planes for $726 million in a deal that would top an
offer from developer Donald Trump.
   The aggressive regional carrier based in Phoenix, Ariz. stated
it would pay $390 million cash for the shuttle. Eastern already has
agreed to Trump's $365 million bid for the profitable Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle, plus 17 smaller, older Boeing 727s.
   However, all sales of Eastern assets must be approved by the
federal bankruptcy court overseeing the airline's Chapter 11
reorganization.
   America West said it submitted the proposal as part of Eastern's
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle _ the name the
developer plans to use for the shuttle _ said, ``We have no
comment. We don't know anything about it,'' referring to the
America West proposal.
   However, he said, ``We have a signed contract with Eastern.''
   Eastern filed for protection from creditors five days after its
Machinists, pilots and flight attendants unions walked off the job
March 4.
   The airline began moving ahead with plans to sell $1.8 billion
in assets and rebuild on a much smaller scale after attempts to
sell the entire company collapsed.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has pushed to have
Eastern sold in its entirety and scheduled a hearing today for
arguments over why such an auction should not take place.
   Billionaire hotel executive Jay Pritzker, former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth and takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn,
who owns Trans World Airlines Inc., are among the investors who
have expressed interest in Eastern at various points during the
past two months.
   America West has indicated its interest in buying Eastern's
shuttle or other assets several times since the strike began.
   As recently as April 28, America West Chairman Edward Beauvais
said the company was interested in buying the shuttle if the sale
to Trump fell through. Beauvais said then that America West had
lined up tentative outside financing and was prepared to bid $600
million to $700 million for the shuttle and a number of aircraft.
   America West is the nation's 10th-largest carrier and serves 46
destinations throughout the United States and Canada.
   The company turned a $45 million loss in 1987 into a profit of
$9.4 million last year.

<HEAD>Farmers Face Plowing Under Winter-Killed Wheat Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wind and cold killed up to 95 percent
of the winter wheat planted in northern Montana and many farmers
are returning to their fields to plow under the winter crop and
plant spring wheat.
   One third of the state's winter wheat acreage has losses of at
least 80 percent, according to a survey by the Montana Grain
Growers Association. The northern tier counties that are the heart
of the state's wheat country, producing premium hard red winter
wheat, were hard hit.
   ``The further north you get, the worse it gets,'' said Allen
Taylor, Montana State University winter wheat breeder.
   West of the Continental Divide, where cheaper soft white winter
wheat is grown in northern counties, crop losses are estimated at
95 percent to 98 percent.
   ``The old-timers say it's the severest winterkill they've ever
seen,'' said Randy Johnson, MGGA executive vice president.
   Despite possibly the worst wipeout in state winter wheat
history, Jim Christianson, executive vice president of the Montana
Wheat and Barley Committee, said farmers generally are optimistic
because of the simultaneous return of wet weather and good prices _
the highest wheat prices in eight years.
   ``It's raining,'' he said. ``They're living under entirely
different conditions than last year. ... They are really upbeat.
I'm sure it's weather-and price-related.''
   Still, the kill was extensive. An MGGA survey indicates that
drought stress last fall and extreme winds and cold over the winter
killed 95 percent of the winter wheat in Toole, Liberty, Hill and
Carter counties and northern Chouteau County.
   Hill and Chouteau counties are Montana's biggest winter-wheat
producers, accounting for more than one-fifth of the state's
acreage normally planted to winter wheat.
   Johnson said a survey of members from throughout the state found
90 percent crop loss in Blaine, Dawson and northern Pondera
counties, 80 percent loss in Blaine County and 70 percent in McCone
and northern Fergus counties.
   Normally, a 25 percent winterkill is considered severe in
Montana. The first official government report on winterkill and
prospective production totals for 1989 won't be released until May
11.
   The winter was so severe that it killed many perennial alfalfa
stands, said MSU legume breeder Ray Ditterline.
   Johnson said that when winterkill exceeds 90 percent in winter
wheat, farmers won't take a chance on the remaining winter wheat
and instead will plow up the entire crop and plant spring wheat,
barley or other spring-sown crops.
   Christianson said his conservative guess is that farmers will
have to re-plant at least 1.1 million of the 2 million acres they
had put into winter wheat last fall.
   Montana's wheat acreage has been divided about evenly between
winter and spring varieties, but this year's harvest may be as much
as three-fourths spring wheat _ which yields about five bushels per
acre below winter but usually brings slightly better prices.
   The re-seeding puts an extra burden on farmers, as crop
insurance does not pay re-seeding costs when winter wheat doesn't
make it. Also, insurance policies on winter wheat are carried over
to re-planted spring wheat _ but the pay-off level is based on
potentially lower yields

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Drop Despite Sale to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with the announcement of a
wheat sale to the Soviet Union having little effect on wheat prices.
   A slight drop in wheat futures in early trading came as somewhat
of a surprise.
   Wheat was expected to open higher following yesterday's White
House announcement that the United States will sell 1.5 million
metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union.
   ``The market has had a fairly good gain over the last few days
and apparently has already factored in the wheat sale,'' said Joel
Karlin, an analyst for Research Department Inc., in Chicago.
   Corn and soybean prices were mixed, with the prospect of more
rain in the Midwest weighing on the market.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.26 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to \ cent higher with May at $3.73} a bushel; oats were 1}
cents to 2 cents lower with May at $1.82\ a bushel; soybeans were
1} cents lower to 4 cents higher with May at $7.38 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 72.35
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .62 cent higher with
May at 76.75 cents a pound; hogs were .17 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with June at 47.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.05 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 31.70 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled higher Tuesday.

<HEAD>Union, Company Agree To Mediation as Coal Strike Turns Violent</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 2 grafs to update with peaceful picketing today;
edits throughout to tighten</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking United Mine Workers resumed
picketing today after union and Pittston Coal Group Inc. officials
agreed to sit down with federal mediators but disagreed on a
seven-day cooling-off period.
   By midmorning the picket lines remained peaceful, unlike Tuesday
when strikers pelted company coal trucks with rocks. Several miners
and truck drivers were injured.
   Also Tuesday, 125 demonstrators were arrested at the company's
Moss No. 3 coal preparation plant at St. Paul. Those arrested, some
of them miners' wives, sat in front of plant entrances to block
coal trucks. They were charged with trespassing, a misdemeanor,
said State Police Lt. C.F. Eaton.
   About 1,500 miners in southwestern Virginia and West Virginia
have been on strike since April 5. The miners had been working
without a contract since February 1988.
   The mediation agreement was announced Tuesday in Richmond by
Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said the union was committed to
bargaining around the clock beginning immediately for seven days.
Trumka also suggested a seven-day cooling off period during which
Pittston would cease production and the union halt its
demonstrations.
   But Pittston President Michael Odom said he did not want his
company, a division of the Pittston Co. of Greenwich, Conn., to be
bound by a seven-day period for mediation.
   ``We strongly believe ... the mediator assigned to the dispute
should have some opportunity to become familiar with the very
complicated issues involved,'' he said.
   Odom also said he saw no reason for a cooling-off period.
   ``Lawful and peaceful picketing is not an impediment to the
process. It is the union's violence that brings disruption to the
coalfield communities,'' he said.
   The injuries occurred at a coal processing plant near McClure,
where coal trucks were being driven by workers from Jamb Coal Co.
under contract to Pittston.
   State Police spokesman Charles Vaughn said troopers told him the
injured strikers were in a parked vehicle that was hit by a coal
truck when the driver attempted to flee ``a hailstorm of rocks
thrown by miners.''
   But miner Larry Stanley said about 20 miners were standing
around watching the coal trucks drive around a tree downed in the
road when the driver of an escort vehicle rammed into the crowd.
   ``He done his best to run over all he could,'' said Stanley.
   Debbie Hall, nursing supervisor at Russell County Medical Center
in Lebanon, said five strikers were treated there and released and
two others were admitted. One truck driver was admitted and another
was transferred to Humana Hospital in Richlands, she said.

<HEAD>TWA Pilots Will Appeal Breach Of Contract Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pilots for Trans World Airlines said today they
would appeal a New York state Supreme Court justice's decision that
upheld the actions of TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn in taking the
company private last year.
   Justice Michael Dontzin Tuesday rejected a challenge by the
pilots, which said the October transaction violated labor
agreements.
   Dontzin, ruling after a trial held in December, found that the
going private transaction was accomplished in accordance with TWA's
labor agreement, the airline said after Tuesday's ruling.
   Pilot Capt. Thomas Ashwood said the appeal seeks to improve the
financial condition of the New York-based carrier by forcing
compliance with contractual commitments intended to assure the
profitable growth of TWA.
   ``The most recent TWA ... financial statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission confirms our reasons for filing
this suit and the absolute necessity of pursuing it through the
appellate process,'' Ashwood said in a prepared statement today.
   The ALPA agreements were entered into in late 1985 and early
1986 when Icahn assumed control of the airline, said TWA, which is
based in suburban Mount Kisco, N.Y.
   ``I am gratified that the actions of TWA in accomplishing the
going private transaction have been vindicated and found to be
totally consistent with my commitment to my unions,'' Icahn said in
a statement issued late Tuesday.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Travelers Corp. said Wednesday its
earnings rose 48.5 percent in spite of a decline in revenue in the
first quarter.
   The insurer said net income rose to $98 million, or 96 cents a
share, on revenue of $3.2 billion, from $66 million, or 60 cents a
share, on revenue of $3.3 billion in the same period a year ago.
   First-quarter results included net realized investment gains of
$1 million, compared to realized investment losses of $11 million
in the first quarter of 1988.
   The Travelers restated prior results to reflect a new accounting
standard. The change resulted in a reduction in reported earnings
of $7 million in the first quarter of 1989 and $6 million in the
first quarter of 1988.
   Under the change, universal life and investment-type contracts
are no longer included in premiums and current and future benefits,
and realized investment gains and losses are now included in pretax
income.
   ``First-quarter earnings benefited from the continued turnaround
in Employee Benefits and improvements in our noninsurance
subsidiaries,'' Edward H. Budd, chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a written statement.
   Net investment income for the first quarter was $869 million,
compared to $941 million for the same period a year ago.
   Premiums were $2 billion for the quarter, compared to $2.1
billion a year ago.
   Assets at the end of the first quarter were $53.9 billion,
compared to $55 billion a year ago. The decreases reflected the
divestiture of some businesses in 1988, the company said.

   Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big
Three automakers in late April dropped 3 percent, compared with the
same period a year ago when sales were moderately strong, the
companies said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
they sold cars and light trucks at an average daily rate of 41,487
during the April 21-30 period this year compared with a rate of
42,772 during the same time last year.
   A 6.2 percent drop in car sales was offset partially by a 2.7
percent increase in light truck sales by the Big Three.
   For the entire month, when each of the companies offered
wide-ranging incentive packages, car and truck sales were up 6.3
percent this year over last April. For the year through April,
vehicle sales were down 5.7 percent compared with the same period
last year.
   The companies have been looking closely at sales results after
the usually strong March and April buying season got off to a slow
start. The incentives are aimed at boosting vehicle sales, which
sagged below expectations during the first three months of the
year, and at forestalling production cuts later in the year.
   However, analysts have said they expected the companies to trim
their production rates during the second half of the year, mainly
through extended model-changeover times during the late summer and
early fall.
   Ford's car sales suffered the most during late April, running
7.4 percent behind last year. Ford's cars sold at an average daily
rate of 7,980 this year, compared with a rate of 8,619 during the
period last year. For the month, Ford's car sales were up 12.9
percent, and through the first four months of this year, car sales
were 0.1 percent over last year's pace.
   The company's light trucks sold in late April at a rate 6.2
percent below the same period last year and through the first four
months of the year sold 2.9 percent under the pace of a year ago.
   GM said its car sales were off 6.1 percent in late April, going
to a daily rate of 13,666 this year from a rate of 14,560 last
year. Sales for the entire month were up 1.2 percent this year, and
GM car sales since Jan. 1 were off 10.7 percent.
   Sales of GM's light trucks ran 14.3 percent ahead of the pace
the company set during late April last year, and for the year,
truck sales were off 1 percent.
   Chrysler showed the smallest decline in car sales in late April,
dropping 4 percent to a daily rate of 4,127 this year, compared
with 4,299 last year. Chrysler's car sales for all of April ran 2.9
percent behind last year's level and for the entire year 17 percent
behind.
   Truck sales by Chrysler were down 1.3 percent in late April and
up 2 percent for the entire year.

   The interview went well, but before Alfonso Morris got his
clerk's job at a Stop 'N Go store in Dallas, he had to spend an
hour taking a test aimed at determining whether he's a liar, thief
or substance abuser.
   It wasn't the first time. In the past two years, Morris, 26, had
been asked by three prospective employers to submit to a
paper-and-pencil grilling about whether he'd used drugs or stolen
any money or merchandise.
   His experience reflects a nationwide quest to create a
drug-free, theft-free workplace, which has increased employer use
of honesty and integrity tests designed to identify potential
problem workers.
   ``They told me they give the survey to everyone before they hire
them, basically to screen you,'' Morris said of Stop 'N Go, which
hired him in March. ``I didn't think too much about it _ I know I'm
a good person and should screen well.''
   But critics complain the tests amount to a written version of a
lie-detector or polygraph exam, violate privacy, aren't scientific
and encourage lazy hiring practices. Some contend the tests can be
designed to detect political beliefs or union sympathies.
   Others fear honest applicants mistakenly will be denied jobs,
although test creators warn against using their questions as the
sole determinant of employment because the tests aren't 100 percent
foolproof.
   Many businesses have reason to suspect workers. Government and
private estimates suggest substance abuse costs about $177 billion
a year in absenteeism, lower productivity, lower work-quality and
higher benefits costs, while employee theft accounts for estimated
losses of $40 billion a year.
   Honesty tests range in cost from $6 to $15 each, including an
evaluation of the results by the test creators. For identifying
drug abusers, they are becoming an attractive alternative to urine
tests, which can cost up to $50 each, are often considered
unreliable and face growing legal challenges.
   A law that took effect in December barring most private
employers from administering polygraph tests also gave written
honesty tests a boost.
   ``As soon as polygraph testing was banned, a bunch of
entrepreneurs got in the act and developed tests that do not
specifically violate any laws and act against other mechanical
forms of testing,'' said Loren Siegel, an attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union in New York.
   The first honesty or integrity tests were developed in the 1960s
by a company now called Reid Psychological Systems, but their use
has multiplied in the past few years. In 1986, an estimated 2.3
million honesty tests were administered; the number is expected to
jump to 5.5 million by next year.
   The tests are surprisingly straightforward. They might ask
whether the applicant has ever stolen anything from an employer, or
how many times in the past month the applicant has used drugs.
   William Rognas, a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee with five
stores in Illinois, for the past two years has required applicants
to take an honesty test. Results are startling.
   Rognas said his food costs have dropped about 4 percent because
employees aren't stealing, and labor costs are down the same amount
as efficiency improved.
   ``We hired one guy without the test and asked him to take it
later. He failed, and we ended up firing him because he was
stealing. It works,'' Rognas said.
   The nationwide crusade against drugs is considered a major
catalyst pushing employers into the nebulous frontier of employee
privacy. ``A lot of this stuff would not be possible were it not
for ... the drug scare that exists,'' Siegel said. ``People are
willing to sacrifice some very fundamental rights'' of privacy.
   With the federal government conceding the drug problem's awesome
magnitude, some experts say a ``policing function'' has been
shifted to business. Siegel said employee testing represents ``the
privatization of law enforcement.''
   Who would admit to drug abuse or theft? Gregory Lousig-Nont,
whose Las Vegas-based company develops and markets honesty tests,
said he continually is surprised at how forthright applicants are
about past transgressions.
   Of 10,723 people applying for work at a national convenience
store chain that took his test last year, 777 admitted to having
shoplifted a total of $26,190 in merchandise, 902 said they think
about shoplifting, and 290 admitted having stolen $67,579 in
merchandise from previous jobs.
   Of 10,440 people tested for the same company, 1,142 admitted to
overdrinking, 739 said they used cocaine and 37 said they sold
amphetamines.
   Questions are designed to prevent a person who used marijuana
once 5 years ago from being lumped into the same ``risk'' category
as one who sold cocaine last week, Lousig-Nont said.
   Experts say some people confess outright because it describes
behavior that has become normal for them. Others are likely to be
tripped up by questions that probe attitudes toward stealing and
taking drugs.
   Employees have no recourse but to submit to testing, even though
experts say court challenges to the tests are inevitable.
   ``If you don't take it, they won't hire you, and there's nothing
you can do about it. That's the bottom line,'' the ACLU's Siegel
said.
   The vast majority of people don't object. Reid Psychological
statistics showed 92 percent of test takers accepted the test while
only 3 percent resented it and the rest had no opinion.
   ``They're user-friendly, uncomplicated and non-stressful,'' said
Robert McCrie, an assistant professor at John Jay College of
Criminal Justice in New York.
   ``Often people are told it's just part of the screening
process,'' he said. ``They're very revealing _ an individual that
could never ask about integrity in a face-to-face interview gets
(information) from people who quite willingly provide it.''
   Nonetheless, the tests are coming under scrutiny. Last October
the House Education and Labor Committee requested a study on the
tests' validity and the ethical implications of their widespread
use. The study, conducted by the Office of Technology Assessment,
is expected to be completed this summer.
   Committee member Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said the tests are
epitomized by a country-western song that goes, ``If you hang `em
all, you get the guilty.''
   Businesses, particularly small ones, ``appear to find it easier
to throw a very wide net than to specifically try to do legitimate
and appropriate personnel screening,'' Williams said.
``Paper-and-pencil tests may not be valid, but they're a hell of a
lot cheaper than personnel departments.''
   The American Psychological Association is studying whether the
tests conform to research standards, since virtually all test
studies have been conducted by the companies that sell them.
   ``The publishers say the tests are valid 80 percent of the time
... there seems to be some skepticism, but basically the jury's
still out,'' said Wayne Camara, the association's director of
scientific affairs.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat prices up
strongly following the White House announcement of additional
subsidized grain sales to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat opened lower at the start of trading, surprising the
market, which expected a strong start for wheat futures.
   ``There were a lot of people who thought the Russian business
was already reflected in prices,'' said Rich Feltes, an analyst
with Refco Inc., in Chicago. ``Today's action showed that any kind
of business outside the United States will be positive'' for the
market.
   The Bush administration has agreed the United States will sell
1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union. The
announcement of the sale was made Tuesday.
   Soybean futures rallied after mid-session, helped along by
continued strength in May soybean demand.
   ``With farmer preoccupation with field work, there is not a lot
soybeans moving to processors or to exporting channels,'' Feltes
said.
   Corn was up modestly, with fairly good rains in Western corn
producing states weighing heavily on the market.
   Wheat closed 1 cent to 11 cents higher with the contract for May
delivery at $4.37{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents higher
with May at $2.76 a bushel; oats were { cent to 2} cents higher
with May at $1.87 cents a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 13 cents
higher with May at $7.47 a bushel.

   The U.S. dollar closed narrowly mixed in light
European trading Wednesday. Gold prices rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said that on the eve of the Ascension
Day holiday, when most European markets will be closed, the dollar
held firm despite intervention by central banks, including the U.S.
Federal Reserve.
   The central banks have been acting concertedly for days to sell
dollars to keep the currency's exchange rate down.
   One London dealer said the dollar's firm tone reflected investor
buying but others wondered how long the dollar can continue to
resist central banks' intervention.
   Dealers said the dollar's short-term direction could be
determined by the release on Friday of the U.S. unemployment
figures for April, an indication of the condition of the U.S.
economy last month.
   While markets in Japan were closed for the Constitution Day
holiday, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen in
London, trading late at 133.93 yen, up from Tuesday's closing
133.85 yen in Tokyo.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6847 late Wednesday, more
expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.6845.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared to Tuesday's
late rates: 1.8900 West German marks, up from 1.8875; 1.6830 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6805; 6.3725 French francs, down from 6.3735;
2.1270 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,379.20 Italian lire, down from
1,379.50; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Gold bullion gained nearly $2 in Zurich, The late bid price was
$379.00 a troy ounce, up from $377.30 late Tuesday. The late bid
price in London was $377.95 an ounce, up from $377.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $376.55 an ounce, up from
$375.95.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid price of $5.65 a

<HEAD>Administration Renews Threat to Veto Minimum Wage Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Wednesday that President
Bush will veto compromise legislation worked out by the House and
Senate to raise the mimimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 an hour by
1991.
   Reacting to Tuesday's agreement between House and Senate
negotiators on legislation to change the wage rate for the first
time in eight years, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said Bush continues to believe the figure is too high.
   ``The president's position is the same, and he reiterated that''
during a meeting with Republican senators, the spokesman said.
``His first proposal (for a $4.25 top rate) was his last proposal.
... He is prepared to veto the bill if they send it up.''
   Bush's stance sets up the first showdown on domestic policy
involving the new president and the Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole several weeks ago told Bush there
were enough Senate supporters of his position to sustain a veto. An
override of a presidential veto requires two-thirds of those
present and voting in both the House and the Senate.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas also said Bush would
hold to his earlier promise to veto the bill.
   ``I just want to set the record straight _ the president will
not yield on this,'' Dole said. In reaching consensus on a final
bill so swiftly, Dole said, Democrats pushing the legislation ``in
effect asked for a confrontation with the president.''
   It took less than an hour Tuesday for the conferees to complete
their work, thanks in large part to staff negotiations conducted
during last week's congressional recess.
   Also contributing to the speedy resolution was that the major
elements of the House and Senate bills were the same. Each called
for raising the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October
1991 and for allowing employers to pay some new workers a
subminimum training wage for two months.
   On the subminimum, the final product contains language very
close to the Senate version, allowing employers to pay new hires 85
percent of the minimum wage if the newcomers have not held a job
for more than 60 days. Once an individual held a job for 60 days,
he or she would never again be eligible to be paid the training
wage.
   The legislation could reach the White House within two weeks,
after passage by the separate houses.
   Bush has said $4.25 an hour is the highest minimum he will
accept, and even that support hinges on a six-month subminimum that
could be paid to all new hires regardless of past job experience.
   Democrats sponsoring the legislation said they were prepared to
confront Bush with the measure and would attempt to override his
expected veto, although they concede Bush currently has more than
enough votes to stymie an override effort.

<TEXT>
   Jim Colbert once earned a living by artfully
whacking a little ball across expansive green lawns and sandy
gullies, seldom thinking about the battles with Mother Nature that
go into golf course designs.
   Now that he's switched from pro to proprietor, he thinks of
little else.
   Today, Jim Colbert Golf Inc. owns or operates 14 public and
private golf courses from California to Florida, with the number
expected to expand into the 20s by the end of the year.
   Colbert is rolling now, but he's learned the hard way that
weather can make or break a good golf operation.
   ``This whole business evolves around water,'' Colbert, 48, said
in an interview. ``You may be plagued with too much or too little.
Once a course is built, the only thing left is drainage, drainage,
drainage _ whether it's yours or the Lord's.
   ``With our courses in Louisiana, the problem is too much water.
In Las Vegas, it's too little.''
   The exception was in 1984, when a rare Las Vegas flood swamped a
course where Colbert's fledgling company had spent $1 million in
remodeling work.
   ``It took $1.5 million and two years to fix it up,'' Colbert
said of damage to the old county-run Winterwood Golf Course. ``That
was our welcome to the golf course business.''
   Today Colbert's company has 500 employees at courses in nine
states.
   Colbert credits a bad back and a decade of duty on the 10-member
PGA Tour Policy Board with nudging him into the golf course
business.
   He served with the leaders of giant corporations, learning how
to build companies and golf courses. By the time he left the board
in 1984, the organization had built 12 TPC (The Players Club)
courses.
   The courses are used as a PGA tournament course once a year, and
the remainder of the year as public or private courses. They are
operated by the PGA tour and ``are very good profit centers for the
tour,'' Colbert said.
   ``Being involved in the building of these courses peeked my
interest in golf courses,'' Colbert recalled.
   Colbert won his first pro title in 1969. By the time nagging
back problems forced him to the sidelines 18 years later, he had
won eight tournaments and more than $1.5 million in prize money.
   ``I didn't play half the time,'' Colbert said of a four-year
span beginning in 1976, when the back problems intensified. ``It
looked like my career was over.''
   A native of Elizabeth, N.J., Colbert grew up in the Kansas City
suburb of Prairie Village, Kan. and attended Kansas State
University in Manhattan on a football scholarship from 1959 to
1964, honing his golf skills as well.
   He called on old friend Ron Fogler, who'd run the Manhattan
Country Club for 23 years, when he cut a deal with the city of Las
Vegas to take over the city course in 1981.
   ``I'd been a touring pro,'' Colbert said. ``I didn't know much
about the operational end of things.''
   Fogler, who had twice served as PGA vice president, took over
the management of the company, concentrating on construction and
remodeling of courses. He remains a key to the company's
operations, utilizing four decades of expertise in the golf course
business.
   The company took on its second project in 1983, Clark County's
Winterwood course. It spent $1 million remodeling the course,
located on the east side of Las Vegas. A disastrous flood that
swamped Las Vegas in 1984 caused $1.5 million damage to the course,
and left a two-year rebuilding challenge.
   ``The second one almost killed us,'' Colbert said. ``We had to
get No. 3 (Phoenix), No. 4 (San Dimas, Calif.) and No. 5 (Tulsa) to
pay for No. 2. It was kind of like Murphy's Law took over. Whatever
could go wrong did.''
   Today Colbert's company owns or operates courses in California,
Florida, Nevada, Louisiana, North Carolina, Kansas, Tennessee, West
Virginia and Arkansas. He declined to give a dollar value of his
company.
   Besides long hours in his Las Vegas office and trips around the
country checking out new course opportunities, he also serves as
sportcaster analyst for the ESPN network at 18 golf tournaments a
year.
   ``We look for problems,'' Colbert said his search for new
properties. ``We look for shortcomings. If we can identify and
solve them, we're a serious buyer. We think more of a product, many
times, than the people who own it.
   ``The art of this trade is buying something and making a profit.
We'll take a bad facility as long as we know we can make it
better.''
   Did he ever dream he'd be a major player in the golf course
business?
   ``I wish I could say I was that smart, but too many people know
me,'' Colbert laughed. ``I saw a tiny hole and I went through that
door.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Firms in New Round of Post-Crash Cutbacks</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic in AP Access under WALLEMPLOY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eighteen months after the stock market crashed
and took thousands of jobs with it, Wall Street still is feeling
the aftershocks.
   Investor mistrust and high interest rates have triggered a
recession in the securities industry, forcing a second wave of
cutbacks at firms awash in profits in the mid-1980s.
   Despite rising prices that have pushed many stocks to post-crash
highs, securities firms have reported weak first-quarter earnings
or outright losses and slashed payrolls by about 2,600 workers in
the last month.
   The cutbacks have pushed Wall Street layoffs to more than 25,000
since the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points on Oct.
19, 1987, the largest single-day decline in New York Stock Exchange
history.
   ``At long last after a year of much lower levels of
profitability, they realized they have to take the bulls by the
horns and do something,'' said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical
Services Corp. ``It's just like when you and I get a toothache, we
take a day or two before we go see the dentist.''
   The staff reductions are blamed on slow business in all
segments, from low volume on the New York Stock Exchange, to a dive
in stock and bond underwriting, to declining merger activity.
   They also represent what Wall Street strategists like to call a
``correction'' _ a counter-reaction to a hiring frenzy from 1982 to
1987 in which securities firms expanded by 20 percent to 30 percent
annually and fresh-faced business-school graduates made six-figure
salaries.
   ``Some firms expanded a couple years ago like it was never going
to end,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, who follows Wall Street for
Prudential Bache Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``There's too
much capacity and we're going through this painful retraction.''
   Business is so bad that the Wall Street Journal, diary of the
financial world, recently published a five-part series titled
``Wall Street's Recession,'' illustrated by cobwebs on a street
sign in lower Manhattan.
   Some symptoms of Wall Street's malaise:
   _Total employment by NYSE-member brokerages has fallen from a
peak of 262,100 employees in September 1987 to about 236,000 today,
according to the Securities Industry Association, a trade
association of brokerages. The firms had hired more than 100,000
workers from the end of 1981 to the crash.
   _Average daily trading volume on the NYSE was 159 million shares
in March, compared with a 1987 average of nearly 189 million shares
and 1988 average of about 162 million shares.
   _Merger activity, an important source of business for Wall
Street, has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years,
according to IDD Information Services Inc., a financial reporting
service.
   In the first quarter of 1989, 708 deals worth $49.6 billion were
completed, vs. 996 deals worth $101.7 billion in the previous
quarter, IDD figures show. Even discounting last year's $25 billion
RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout, the biggest takeover in history, the value
of completed deals was off about 25 percent.
   _Fees generated by underwriting new issues of corporate stocks
and bonds have plummeted. In the first quarter of 1989, 305 new
issues generated fees of $554.7 million, less than half the 692 new
issues and fees of $1.35 billion in the same 1988 period, according
to Securities Data Co.
   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is selling its entire retail
brokerage division of 2,300 workers, partly because of its bad
image from an insider trading scandal but more from generally bad
business. Further large cuts are expected in Drexel bond units.
First Boston Corp. laid off 200 employees, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
dropped 30 professionals and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. reportedly has
let go dozens of bond traders.
   Analysts forecast another 5,000 to 10,000 layoffs in coming
months.
   ``We are in the midst of a very serious, chronic crisis,''
Salomon Brothers Inc. Chairman John Gutfreund, whose firm lost $28
million in the first quarter, told a recent meeting sponsored by
the Investment Association of New York.
   Some analysts said the public also has learned from the 1987
crash _ which Wall Streeters euphemistically have taken to calling
a ``market break'' _ the lesson that the volatile nature of the
market may not be worth the risk.
   With yields of 9 percent or more on money market funds and
certificates of deposit, individual investors are steering clear of
the riskier stock market. But for securities firms, commissions on
money market investments made for customers are far lower than for
stocks.
   ``Now we're just not addressing the issue of overcapacity. Now
the revenues just aren't coming in,'' said Jack Barbanel, senior
vice president of Gruntal &amp; Co., a midsized New York securities
firm.
   Overall, Barbanel said commission-generated revenues are down
about 35 percent across the board.
   ``The public has generally decided to stay on the sidelines and
take advantage of the high yields with the minimum amount of
risk,'' he said. ``If you can get 9 or 10 percent on a risk-free
basis, there's no point for someone with limited resources to
speculate in the stock market.''
   James Cloonan, president of the American Association of
Individual Investors in Chicago, said the average stock holding
among the 105,000 members of his organization has fallen 6 percent
in the last two years, to about 29 percent of portfolios.
   ``The industry just kept spinning on their best day and best
month and that's not how the world works,'' he said.
   But if business is so bad, why have some stock-market price
barometers reached post-crash highs, with the Dow Jones industrial
average poking through the 2,400 mark?
   Analysts attribute the rise to a strong dollar luring foreign
investment into the market and to cautious trading by investors
still participating. Also, they said recent corporate mergers and
takeovers have sharply increased the value of some stocks.
   A still-strong economy has put corporate earnings about where
they should be, analysts said. But without large numbers of
transactions, Wall Street's firms don't necessarily profit. Higher
rent and salary costs from the boom days also have hurt securities
firms.
   ``There is less volume in firms that have higher overheads,''
said Robert Brusca, chief economist with Nikko Securities
International Inc. ``They find their profit margins on each trade
are even lower than before. Ouch! Ouch!''

<HEAD>Arguments On Validity Of Bhopal Disaster Law End</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday concluded
hearing arguments on the legality of a law that empowered the
government to represent all victims of the Bhopal gas disaster,
news reports said.
   A five-judge panel, headed by judge Sabyasachi Mukharji, did not
say when it will give its verdict on a group of petitions that
sought to strike down the Parliament-approved law on grounds of
unconstitutionality.
   The government, armed with the law, reached a $470 million
settlement on Feb. 14 with Union Carbide Corp. For compensation to
the victims and survivors of the disaster.
   The settlement will be scrapped if the panel upholds the
petitions and declares the law unconstitutional.

<HEAD>Late Buying Surge Sends Oil Futures Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil and wholesale home heating oil futures
finished higher Wednesday, lifted by a late spurt of buying on news
that the disruption in North Sea oil production will last longer
than than previously expected.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, gained 30
cents to settle at $20.10 a barrel, after a loss of 86 cents on
Tuesday.
   Heating oil for June delivery was buoyed by the crude oil buying
and ended the session up 0.25 cent at 47.86 cents a gallon. The
contract had slipped 1.85 cents in the previous session.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
the June contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline settled 1.86
cents lower at 69.39 cents a gallon following Tuesday's loss of
1.36 cents.
   Market participants were in a selling mood for much of the day
and prices were weak.
   But, as the session was drawing to a close, Shell Exploration
and Production Co. said repairs on its Cormorant Alpha platform in
the North Sea were likely to take longer than anticipated, delaying
the resumption of operations until later this month.
   Shell's platform was damaged by an explosion April 18, causing
the shutdown of a transportation and production system for Brent
crude, a key international grade of crude oil. The disruption has
taken about 470,000 barrels a day off the world crude market.
   Shell said that May 26 was a reasonable date on which to expect
operations to return to normal but a resumption could take place as
early as May 18. There had been speculation in the market that the
resumption might occur next week.
   Jerry Samuels, an energy broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said crude and heating oil futures also derived strength from
continued selling in the gasoline futures pits.
   Gasoline prices had been bid steadily higher recently in
anticipation of possible shortages due to the Exxon oil spill off
the Alaskan coast in March and the seasonal increase in demand.
   Samuels said trading volume Wednesday was moderate.

<HEAD>Met Life Buys 10 Percent of Investment Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CS First Boston Co. said Wednesday that
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. has bought about 10 percent of the
investment firm.
   The value of the sale was not disclosed by the privately held
New York-based investment firm. It said the shares being sold are
part of a 30.5 percent holding of Saudi Arabian investor Suliman
Olayan.
   CS First Boston was formed in a $1.1 billion merger of First
Boston Inc. and Financiere Credit Suisse-First Boston of London.
   ``The transaction is a strategic investment which we expect will
substantially extend our global reach as part of our long-range
plan to develop a worldwide business and investment capability,''
Met Life Chairman Robert G. Schwartz said in a statement.
   The Swiss banking conglomerate Credit Suisse owns 44.5 percent
of the new entity, giving it effective control and the largest
foreign stake in a major Wall Street securities house. Management
partners of First Boston own 25 percent.
   First Boston and Credit Suisse created Financiere Credit
Suisse-First Boston as a joint venture, in 1978.
   Met Life, one of the nation's largest insurance and financial
services companies, manages more than $120 billion in assets.

   The dollar firmed Wednesday against most major
currencies in quiet worldwide trading even though central banks
intervened to push down its value.
   Gold prices moved higher. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $377.40 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
$1.05 from late Tuesday.
   Currency dealers said reported dollar selling by a handful of
central banks, including the Federal Reserve, failed to dampen the
market's overriding bullish sentiment toward the U.S. currency.
   ``At best you can say it's holding the dollar from going
higher,'' said Earl I. Johnson, a dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago. ``What we have here is a confrontation between the market
and the central banks.''
   Worldwide demand for the dollar has been high in recent weeks
due to the continued strength of the U.S. economy and relatively
high American interest rates, which make dollar-denominated
investments more attractive.
   Some dealers said the short-term direction of the dollar could
be determined later this week, with Friday's release of April
unemployment data.
   The markets were closed Wednesday in Japan for the Constitution
Day holiday. But in London the dollar strengthened against the
Japanese yen, trading at 133.93 yen, up from Tuesday's closing
133.85 yen in Tokyo. Later, in New York, the dollar rose to 134.295
yen from 134.275 Tuesday.
   Most European markets will be closed on Thursday for the the
Ascension Day holiday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6847, more expensive for
buyers than Tuesday's late $1.6845. Sterling fetched $1.6820 in New
York, up from $1.68055. Other late dollar rates in New York
compared to Tuesday's rates, included: 1.89325 West German marks,
up from 1.8919; 1.68705 Swiss francs, up from 1.68425; 1.18415
Canadian dollars, up from 1.18125; 6.3905 French francs, down from
6.3950; and 1,383.05 Italian lire, down from 1,383.25.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared to Tuesday: 1.8900 West
German marks, up from 1.8875; 1.6830 Swiss francs, up from 1.6805;
6.3725 French francs, down from 6.3735; 2.1270 Dutch guilders,
unchanged; 1,379.20 Italian lire, down from 1,379.50; and 1.1830
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   On the Comex in New York, gold bullion for current delivery rose
to $378.40 a troy ounce from $377.80 Tuesday.
   Gold rose in London to $377.95 an ounce from $377.50, and in
Zurich, to $379.00 an ounce from $377.30.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $376.55 an ounce, up from
$375.95.
   Silver prices were mixed. On the New York Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.635 a troy ounce from $5.617
Tuesday. But silver was unchanged in London at $5.65 an ounce.

   Indicted financier Michael Milken
was honored Wednesday for multimillion-dollar donations to charity
at a celebrity-studded lunch sponsored by a group that helps
children.
   Milken, who lost his job as top bond trader for Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. because of his alleged role in a staggering
securities-fraud scandal, was praised as one who gives unstintingly
_ not just with money but his own time.
   He also has become a personal friend of many children aided by
the H.E.L.P. group, said the organization's founder, Barbara
Firestone.
   ``Michael is the kind of guy who is always giving and not
demanding anything in return,'' Ms. Firestone said at the lunch.
   Milken, one of the nation's most dynamic and wealthy financiers,
was indicted March 29 on 98 federal counts of racketeering, fraud
and stock manipulation stemming largely from the confessions of
now-imprisoned insider trader Ivan Boesky.
   Charged along with Milken are his brother, Lowell, and Drexel
trader Bruce Newberg. All have asserted their innocence and vowed
to fight the charges.
   Before his appearance at the Beverly Hilton Hotel lunch, Milken,
who has portrayed himself as the target of overzealous prosecutors,
told a reporter who asked about his public image: ``What you see
here is reality.''
   Among the approximately 1,000 attending the luncheon were
comedian Whoopi Goldberg, actor Dennis Weaver, Los Angeles Dodgers
baseball manager Tommy Lasorda and California state Controller Gray
Davis.
   The gathering was held in the same ballroom used for the
``Predators Ball,'' an annual Drexel conference on the value of
junk bonds. Milken, credited with creating the multibillion-dollar
market in those high-yield, high-risk bonds, missed this year's
Predators Ball a few weeks ago for the first time in 10 years
because of his legal problems.
   H.E.L.P. provides group homes for children who have physical,
mental or emotional problems.

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Respond To Soviet Grain Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat prices up strongly following the
White House announcement of additional subsidized grain sales to
the Soviet Union.
   On other markets, cotton prices rose, energy futures were mostly
higher, livestock futures were up and pork futures were mixed.
Precious metals also were mixed.
   Wheat settled 1 cent to 11 cents higher with the contract for
May delivery at $4.37{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents higher
with May at $2.76 a bushel; oats were { cent to 2} cents higher
with May at $1.87 cents a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 12}
cents higher with May at $7.46} a bushel.
   Wheat opened lower at the start of trading, surprising a market
that expected a strong start for wheat futures.
   ``There were a lot of people who thought the Russian business
was already reflected in prices,'' said Rich Feltes, an analyst
with Refco Inc. in Chicago. ``Today's action showed that any kind
of business outside the United States will be positive'' for the
market.
   The Bush administration announced Tuesday the United States will
sell 1.5 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union under the
export bonus program.
   Soybeans futures rallied after mid-sesssion, helped along by
continued strength in May soybean demand.
   ``With farmer preoccupation with field work, there is not a lot
of soybeans moving to processors or to exporting channels,'' Feltes
said.
   Corn was up modestly, with fairly good rains in Western
corn-producing states weighing heavily on the market.
   Cotton futures prices rose sharply on New York's Cotton Exchange
on reports of severe damage to the Soviet Union's cotton crop.
   The rally also was stimulated by commission house and local
buying, said Ernest Simon, a cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported the Central Asian Republic
of Uzbekistan suffered losses in crops and livestock following four
days of heavy rain and snow.
   ``This particular Russian problem has been with us for two
weeks,'' said Simon. ``But the news services have just begun to
point it out and strengthened new crop orders.''
   Cotton settled 1.04 cents to 1.33 cents higher with May at 66.33
cents a pound.
   Energy futures were mostly higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as gasoline prices came under pressure in the wake of a
American Petroleum Institute report of increased imports.
   ``People were taking profits,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst
with Carson Petroleum Co. in Chicago.
   Crude was off in sympathy with gasoline prices early in the
session, but rebounded.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 30 cents to 49 cents
higher with June at $20.10 a barrel; heating oil was 1.34 cents
lower to .41 cent higher with June at 47.86 a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.86 cents lower to .89 cent higher with June at 69.39
cents a gallon.
   Livestock prices were higher and pork futures were mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures rose as higher cash prices were reported at
recent stock auctions.
   Hogs were mixed on continued light demand, although warehouses
were doing a some buying, said Dale Benson, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .50 cent higher with June at
72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .97 cent
higher with May at 76.55 a pound; hogs were .02 cent lower to .25
cent higher with June at 47.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .58 cent lower to .10 cent higher with May at 30.82 cents a
pound.
   Gold and silver futures were mixed in quiet trading on New
York's Commodities Exchange.
   ``The firm dollar was a negative,'' said Fred Demler, a metals
economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, adding the
market is waiting for new economic data due out later this week.
   Gold settled $3.60 lower to 60 cents higher, with May at $378.40
a troy ounce; silver was .1 cent lower to 1.8 cents higher with May
at $5.635 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Campeau And May Department Stores In $47 Million Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. Wednesday said it has filed a complaint against
May Department Stores Co. over a disagreement related to May's
purchase of Filene's and Foley's from Campeau's Federated
Department Stores Inc. division.
   The complaint, filed by Campeau and Federated in U.S. District
Court in New York, seeks a judgment on whether the purchase
agreement between the retailers provides for certain adjustments in
the amount of money May paid for Boston-based Filene's and
Houston-based Foley's department stores.
   Campeau, a Canadian company that has real estate and retail
holdings including strings of department stores in the United
States, said the amount of the adjustments in dispute is about $47
million.
   Toronto-based Campeau said May has until May 18 to respond to
the complaint, which was disclosed in a filing to the Securities
and Exchange Commission. It was filed in the Manhattan court on
April 20.
   A spokesman at May's headquarters in St. Louis said the company
was disappointed that Campeau and Federated filed the complaint
instead of seeking a solution to their disagreement through
arbitration.
   ``We previously advised Campeau of the need for arbitration of
our mutual disagreements in the purchase price adjustments both for
the Foley's and Filene's transactions ...,'' the spokesman said.
   Federated sold the Filene's and Foley's operations to May about
a year ago for $1.53 billion at the time Campeau acquired
Cincinnati-based Federated.

<HEAD>Pan Am Reports Widening of First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. reported Wednesday its
first-quarter loss widened to $151.1 million from $83.3 million a
year earlier, due in part to the bombing of its Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in December.
   Pan Am said the attack on Flight 103, in which 270 people were
killed, raised passenger concern about terrorism, and led to a 16
percent drop in Atlantic traffic at the corporation's main
subsidiary, Pan American World Airways.
   Revenue from the Pan Am Shuttle and Pan Am Express jumped 46.4
percent to $59.9 million from $40.9 million, Pan Am said. The
shuttle benefited from the troubles at Eastern Airlines, which
culminated with a Machinists strike near the end of the quarter.
   The parent company reported $733.5 million in revenue for the
first three months of 1989, down from $763.9 million a year earlier.
   Pan Am, which has suffered losses for several years, said its
labor expenses increased despite cost-cutting contracts with its
unions.
   However, the company said that aside from the drop in Atlantic
traffic its results were about as expected.

<HEAD>Control Data Discussing Selling ETA Assets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. is discussing with
``several parties'' the possible sale of assets of its defunct ETA
Systems supercomputer subsidiary, the president told shareholders
Wednesday.
   ``In the case of ETA, we are currently meeting with customers
and vendors,'' President Larry Perlman said at Control Data's
annual meeting. ``We are also in very preliminary discussions with
several parties to attempt to sell ETA assets and technology.''
   If Control Data tries to sell ETA assets to a Japanese company,
some analysts say it would raise concerns in Congress that valuable
U.S. technology would be handed over to a foreign country.
   Meanwhile, Control Data Chairman Robert Price told shareholders
that last month's decision to close ETA and streamline the
company's Cyber Systems mainframe business was painful but
``essential to the continued successful implementation of the
company's strategic focus.''
   Control Data said the restructuring would result in charges of
$490 million and layoffs of 3,100 employees, including 800 at ETA,
which failed to make money in its six-year history.
   Price said the restructuring should result in a profitable
second half and set the stage for sustained growth.
   Price said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that Control Data can
arrange new credit of somewhat over $100 million to cover
short-term cash needs until later this year, when the company
expects to complete the sale of some assets.
   The company took a step in that direction Wednesday, announcing
that it had sold Action Data Services to Primerica Corp. Terms of
the sale were not disclosed.
   St. Louis-based Action Data Services, which had revenues of
$23.3 million in 1988, provides data processing and support
products to consumer credit companies and other financial services
institutions, including Primerica's Commercial Credit Co.
subsidiary.
   Several shareholders criticized company management for a
severance agreement that gave retired executive Norbert Berg nearly
$4 million, although Control Data reported profits of only $1.7
million in 1988.
   Berg, who still serves on the board of directors and acts as a
part-time consultant to the company after serving as one of Control
Data's key executives during his 29-year tenure, received scattered
boos when introduced to the shareholders at the start of the
meeting. He did not address the group.

<TEXT>
   America West Airlines, which has grown in
six years to the 10th-largest air carrier in the nation, has no
qualms about extending itself to the Northeast.
   ``We consider this one of the most profitable opportunities in
our industry,'' Chairman Edward Beauvais told a news conference
Wednesday after announcing a $726 million offer for Eastern
Airlines' Northeast shuttle operation.
   Beauvais estimated his airline would need to hire 800 employees
to run the shuttle. He said he expected annual revenue of $300
million to $400 million from the operation.
   America West offered $390 million cash for the shuttle, with the
balance in cash and debt assumption on 10 Boeing 757 aircraft, a
press release said. However, Beauvais said the other $336 million
included 21 Boeing 727s.
   America West does not want the 727s but would dispose of them as
a credit back to Eastern or in other ways, Beauvais said.
   The offer had to be made in haste, because U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton R. Lifland had scheduled a May 12 hearing on the $365
million offer for the shuttle from New York developer Donald Trump,
Beauvais said. Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, and
Lifland must approve any sale of assets.
   If successful in its bid, America West would operate the shuttle
from its headquarters in this Phoenix suburb.
   ``This would improve our visibility on the East Coast, and it
fits right into our specialty, which is high-frequency service in
high-density markets,'' Beauvais said.
   America West is the nation's largest airline without any
union-represented employees, and Beauvais said the operation would
be ``an America West operation, with America West employees.'' He
said Eastern employees would be interviewed for possible rehiring.
   Asked if he expected opposition from labor, Beauvais said he
didn't think so, because the 800 jobs represent only a fraction of
Eastern's workforce.
   ``I think Eastern employees would be very enthusiastic,''
Beauvais said, ``because, first, the fringe benefits at America
West compare favorably with Eastern's, and, second, the environment
at America West is very good.''
   In the last year, America West has applied for service to Japan
and Australia and has ordered 25 Boeing 737-300s or 757s for
delivery between 1992 and 1995. Despite the $800 million order,
Beauvais said America West was far from over-leveraged.
   The firm's New York investment banker, Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.,
has assured company officers that the financing could be
accomplished, he said.
   ``This seems like a large chunk. It's not,'' Beauvais said.
``This is a $900 million company ... We've always been adequately
financed, and we've never had a cash problem. We're well suited to
take advantage of these opportunities.''
   Started in mid-1983 with 280 employees and three 737s, America
West today has about 8,500 employees and 70 planes. It serves 47
cities.
   It carried 12.7 million passengers last year, turning a $9.4
million profit on revenue of $775.7 million. In the first quarter
of 1989, America West posted a $10.1 million profit.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union officials announced plans Wednesday
to pursue an employee buyout of strike-plagued Colt Firearms, which
was put on the market last week by Colt Industries Inc.
   Springfield, Mass.-based Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., a Colt
competitor, has also expressed interest in buying the division.
   Robert Madore, president of Local 376 of the United Auto
Workers, said the company had hired the Waterbury-based Naugatuck
Valley Project, which has assisted in other employee buyout
attempts, to conduct a feasibility study.
   The project asked Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., the New York investment
banker hired by Colt Industries to sell the firearms division, to
supply financial information about Colt Wednesday morning, Madore
said.
   ``We are firmly commited to pursuing at whatever lengths the
feasibility and possibility of making an offer,'' Madore said. ``We
don't see any other manufacturer ... buying Colt Firearms with a
commitment to staying in Connecticut.''
   Madore predicted that any other company that bought Colt
Firearms would sell off its assets, take control of its patents and
close its Hartford and West Hartford plants.
   New York-based Colt Industries announced Friday it wanted to
sell the troubled firearms division to concentrate on its
aerospace, automotive and industrial services operations.
   Colt has not put a price on the division, but industry analysts
have said it probably is worth $150 million to $200 million.
   The UAM represents about 1,100 workers who walked out three
years ago. The firearms division has staffed its Hartford and West
Hartford plants mostly with non-union replacement workers, although
some union members have crossed picket lines and returned to work.
About 800 workers remain on strike.
   About 650 strikers voted unanimously Tuesday night to pursue the
buyout, Madore said.
   Andrew W. Brecher, deputy commissioner for the state Department
of Economic Development, said the department has specialists who
can advise employees on how to obtain financing for such buyouts,
although he warned the buyouts face enormous difficulties.
   ``The track record is spotty,'' he said. ``There haven't been
that many successful ones in Connecticut. The ingredients really
require that you have a very patient seller, a seller that for one
reason or another is motivated to work with employees.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Down After S&amp;L Financing Procedure Disclosed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell Wednesday after the Treasury
Department announced procedures for selling $50 billion in new debt
to help finance a bailout of the nation's ailing thrifts.
   Credit-market strategists said the Treasury's plan was
structured in such a way that it had the effect of removing some
potential demand for other government bonds, which helped depress
prices.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 9-16 point, or $5.63
per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from price, climbed to 9.00 percent from 8.95 percent
late Tuesday.
   The Treasury said it would issue zero-coupon bonds to Resolution
Funding Corp., the government-formed borrowing corporation that
would raise $50 billion under President Bush's plan to finance
liquidation of insolvent thrifts.
   Zero-coupon bonds are sold at a discount and redeemed after a
specific period at a specific face value.
   Under the thrift legislation, Refcorp would sell $50 billion of
30-year bonds over three years _ $10 billion in the current fiscal
year, $25 billion in fiscal 1990 and $15 billion in fiscal 1991.
   William Sullivan, director of money-market research for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said prices fell because under the Treasury
plan, Refcorp won't have to buy bonds in the open market to serve
as collateral for the zero-coupon bonds it will sell to raise money
for the bailouts.
   The 30-year bond was unchanged to up slightly in light trading
until the late-afternoon announcement.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short- and
intermediate-term securities were unchanged to down 3-32 point
while long-term governments were off \ point to 19-32 point, the
Telerate Inc. financial reporting service said.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.75 to 1,132.66.
   Corporate bond prices were up slightly. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of
80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained
0.18 to 304.62.
   The Bond Buyer index was unavailable.
   Yields on 3-month Treasury bills rose to 8.84 percent as the
discount gained 2 basis points to 8.52 percent. Yields on 6-month
bills fell to 8.98 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to
8.49 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 9.14
percent as the discount held at 8.47 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 10{ percent, up from 9} percent late Tuesday.

year, said its latest move would reduce duplication among
manufacturing facilities created by the August 1981 acquisition of
Fairchild Semiconductor.
   The company plans to transfer the operations performed in its
Seoul factory to other plants in Asia by June 1. About 250 workers
will lose their jobs, said company spokeswoman Mary Coady.
   There will not be any significant loss of the 2,900 jobs in
Singapore, she said.
   National Semiconductor assembles and tests a variety of
microelectronic products in its Seoul and Singapore facilities.
   A month ago, National Semiconductor shut down its plant in
Danbury, Conn., displacing 400 workers and cutting ties with the
company's birthplace.

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coleman Co.'s former president, Lawrence M.
Jones, was brought back by the new owner of the outdoor recreation
products manufacturer Wednesday to take that post again.
   Sheldon Coleman, grandson of the founder of the company,
announced Tuesday that Wall Street takeover strategist Ronald O.
Perelman had fired him as president, chief executive and board
chairman. A Coleman Co. prepared statement Wednesday said Sheldon
Coleman resigned.
   Jones, 58, left Coleman in January 1988 to become vice chairman
and chief financial officer for the Fleming Cos. in Oklahoma City.
He was chairman of the Coleman executive committee from 1985 to
1987 after serving as president from 1971.
   Jones is a former chairman of the Kansas Board of Regents and
was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for
governor in 1986.
   Jerry Levin, executive vice president of MacAndrews &amp; Forbes
Holdings Inc., was appointed Coleman chairman Wednesday. He said he
would serve as liaison with MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, which is wholly
owned by Perelman and is Coleman Co.'s new parent corporation. The
investment firm also owns Revlon Inc.
   Perelman bought Coleman Co. six weeks ago for $545 million.
   Coleman's offices will remain in Wichita. Levin will keep his
office at MacAndrews &amp; Forbes' Midwestern headquarters in
Minneapolis, he said.
   Coleman is the world's top manufacturer of outdoor recreation
products, including Coleman lanterns. Record sales of $657.9
million and record earnings of $24.5 million were recorded in 1988.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ogilvy Group Inc., the advertising agency
holding company under threat of a hostile takeover, said Wednesday
its first-quarter profit rose 10.6 percent over the same 1988
period.
   Ogilvy reported net income of $3.8 million, or 26 cents a share,
on revenue of $197.7 million. That compared with earnings of $3.43
million, or 24 cents a share, on revenue of $191.1 million in the
first quarter last year.
   The New York company attributed the gains to strong overseas
performances. It said foreign advertising revenues increased 12.6
percent while domestic advertising revenues were flat.
   WPP Group PLC of London, which owns J. Walter Thompson, the big
New York advertising firm, made an unsolicited $730 million bid for
Ogilvy last week. Ogilvy, parent company of Ogilvy &amp; Mather
Worldwide, said it wants to remain independent.
   Ogilvy, the world's fifth-largest ad holding company, said
quarterly advertising revenues increased 5 percent to $123.6
million from $117.7 million a year ago. Its public relations
division, which includes Adams &amp; Rhinehart, showed a 30 percent
revenue rise, to $12.99 million.
   Its marketing research division revenue declined 10 percent,
while other areas suffered a 23 percent drop, principally from
divested operations.

<HEAD>Textile Caucus Forms Task Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional allies of the textile industry,
undaunted by setbacks in recent years, formed a task force
Wednesday to search for new means to combat foreign inroads in the
U.S. market.
   ``We know that the textile and apparel workers that we represent
need their jobs,'' said Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn, chairman of the
Congressional Textile Caucus. ``We will have to find creative
legislative solutions to slow the flood of imports that is
threatening their jobs.''
   Lloyd said President Bush already has made it clear that he will
not back omnibus legislation to aid the textile industry. Congress
has passed such measures in recent years but sponsors have been
unable to muster enough votes to override presidential vetoes.
   Instead of putting all of their efforts into one bill, Lloyd
said, textile lawmakers would ``pursue many avenues to assist the
textile and apparel industry ... Our legislative activities will be
much more diverse than they have been in recent years.''
   As examples, she cited a bill introduced by Rep. Ed Jenkins,
D-Ga., that would eliminate a scheduled 50 percent cut in tariffs
on textiles and apparels imported from Caribbean Basin Initiative
countries.
   Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., may offer measures involving military
apparel, Lloyd said in a statement released by her office.
   Besides Lloyd, other members of the task force are Reps. Butler
Derrick, D-S.C.; Frank Horton, R-N.Y., and Joseph Moakley, D-Mass.

<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission Wednesday released
its 1989 report on U.S. trade barriers, singling out 42 regulations
and trade practices that it said impedes imports from the 12
European Economic Community nations.
   The barriers include quantitative restrictions, export
subsidies, customs barriers, public procurement policies,
countervailing duties, anti-dumping procedures and tax policies,
the EEC report said.
   Its release came five days after the U.S. administration
released its report on foreign trade practices it considers unfair.
   EEC Commission spokesman Claus Ehlermann said the timing of the
release of the EEC report was not linked to the U.S. report. He
said the EEC report was an annual event and its release simply
``coincided'' with the report by the Office of the U.S. Special
Trade Representative.
   The EEC report criticized the 1988 U.S. Fair Trade Practices Act
which, it said, will ``make it more likely that unilateral action
will be taken to redress allegedly unfair trade practices,''
   ``Such unilateral action...without authorization from the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is illegal.''
   The report also cited the ``Buy American'' provision of the U.S.
Trade Act that ``has created permanent discrimination in favor of
U.S. products.''
   The clause provides for action by the U.S. Administration
against foreign countries which discriminate against U.S. products
or services in government procurement, including a ban against
``offending'' countries.
   Another category of restrictions includes U.S. measures which
have been found to violate international trading rules, and in
which the United States has neither modified nor offered
compensation to its trade partners for trade damage caused.
   As examples the report cites the ``U.S. failure'' to implement
findings of the GATT on the illegality of the ``Superfund'' oil
levy and the ``non-conformity'' of the U.S. system of customs
users' fees.

after 99.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Connecticut lawmakers, declaring that
cable television has turned from a luxury into a ``psychological
necessity'' for millions of Americans, vowed Wednesday to press for
consumer protections against fast-rising rates.
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., and Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., introduced legislation to place regulations on an industry
that they say has been riding roughshod over consumers since it
began setting its own rates 2{ years ago.
   ``It is time to return consumer protections to cable
television,'' Lieberman said. ``We're not trying to punish the
cable TV industry. We're just saying `Let's be fair'.''
   Congress barred state and local governments from setting cable
TV rates in most jurisdictions effective Dec. 29, 1986. The move
was designed to foster growth in the relatively new industry. Cable
companies had complained that their basic rates were kept
artificially low by local officials who were subject to election
pressures.
   But with virtually no competition _ more than 99 percent of the
nation's cable systems enjoy a local cable monpoly _ basic service
prices have risen 32 percent since deregulation, Shays said. The
Commerce Department estimates that rates will increase by about 14
percent this year, according to Lieberman.
   Shays said the monthly service fee on the basic package in his
southern Connecticut district has increased from $4.50 in 1984 to
$19.95 today.
   ``It is one thing for the government to foster the growth and
development of a fledgling industry ... and quite another to allow
a powerful industry to continue extracting monopoly prices from the
nation's consumers,'' the senator said.
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' Shays said at a news
conference. ``There's either got to be competition or regulation.''
   Lynn McReynolds of the National Cable Television Association
argued that cable TV operators do not have monopolies because the
$13.8 billion industry competes with commercial television as well
as video rentals, satellite TV and movie theaters.
   ``Cable is a competitor in the entertainment marketplace and
there's lots of competition,'' she said.
   McReynolds said basic service fees have increased by about
one-third since deregulation because those fees had been set by
local officials. Other special services, which were never
regulated, have seen only slight increases and in some cases
decreases since December 1986, she said.
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics said overall cable fees increased
by 6.6 percent in the first year of deregulation and 7.9 percent
last year, according to McReynolds.
   Industry representatives also argue that cable TV is a luxury
that consumers can choose to buy, and therefore should not be
regulated like power companies.
   ``We'd like to get to the point that we're a necessity, but
we're still a long way from that,'' McReynolds said.
   The lawmakers, however, argued that cable TV has become more and
more of a necessity as cable companies buy up rights to sporting
events and other programming that previously was available on
traditional commercial television.
   ``It's become an essential part of our lives,'' said Shays.
   Lieberman said many Americans, especially the elderly, rely
heavily on cable programs for their news, entertainment and even
shopping. He called cable ``a psychological necessity.''
   The bill would allow local governments to set cable rates,
require 60-day notices for service changes and allow regulators to
adjust rates as a result of any changes. The measure also seeks to
limit concentration of ownership and encourage cable systems to
provide local stations.
   The issue of re-regulating the cable industry emerged in
Congress last year during hearings held by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, but Lieberman and Shays are unsure of their prospects for
success in this session.
   ``Most legislators would like this issue to go away,'' said
Shays, pointing to the conflict between consumer interests and a
well-financed industry.
   McReynolds urged Congress to hold off on any action until the
Federal Communications Commission submits a report at the end of
1990 analyzing the impact of cable deregulation.
   Nearly 55 percent of all TV households in the nation get cable
television.

<TEXT>
   USAir Group Inc. announced a $1.3 billion deal
Wednesday with McDonnell Douglas Corp. to buy 20 of its MD-82
aircraft and take options on 20 more.
   The first two of the new planes would be delivered in September
1992 and the remainder of the firm orders and options, if taken,
would be delivered to USAir at the rate of one per month starting
in January 1993.
   The planes will carry about 143 passengers, including an
eight-seat first-class section.
   Washington-based USAir, the nation's ninth-largest airline, is a
long-time operator of McDonnell Douglas aircraft.
   USAir's fleet currently includes 31 Md-80s acquired through the
1988 merger of Pacific Southwest Airline, and 74 smaller DC-9's,
which also were made by McDonnell Douglas.
   Last month, USAir ordered 18 Boeing 737 jetliners and took
options on 36 more in a deal with a potential value of about $1.7
billion.
   That transaction brings USAir's current Boeing 737 orders to 68
aircraft, which will be delivered between now and 1992, plus 96
options, which would be delivered between 1992 and 1995, USAir said.
   USAir also has ordered 20 Fokker 100 jets and holds options on
20 more. First delivery is scheduled for June. Fokker is a Dutch
aircraft manufacturer.

<HEAD>Report: KKR Interested In Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. has indicated an interest in acquiring NWA
Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines, according to a report
published Wednesday.
   KKR formally told Northwest of its interest in a bid, the Wall
Street Journal reported, quoting unidentified people familiar with
the takeover battle. The notification Tuesday came as part of a
bidding procedure NWA set up in response to oil billionaire Marvin
Davis' offer, the Journal said.
   If KKR pursues a bid, it would be the firm's largest known
buyout effort since it bought RJR Nabisco Inc. for a record $25
billion in February, according to the Journal.
   Spokesmen for KKR and NWA refused comment on KKR's apparent
interest, the newspaper said.
   KKR's disclosure came in response to a deadline set by NWA's
investment banker, First Boston Corp., the Journal said. Bidders
will next gain access to confidential company data as well as
meetings with company management in return for signing a
confidentiality agreement.
   Also on Tuesday, Davis put his hostile $2.7 billion bid for
Northwest on hold in exchange for confidential corporation
information from the nation's fourth-largest airline.
   Davis' offer will remain outstanding but he will postpone buying
up shares prior to June 30. He also agreed to stop soliciting
proxies from shareholders in an attempt to unseat the company's
board of directors at the annual stockholders meeting May 15.
   The NWA board has rejected Davis' $90-a-share offer as
inadequate. NWA stock closed Wednesday at $101.50, down 25 cents on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   Davis said the restrictions will end immediately if NWA
announces the sale of the company or a non-sale alternative,
including no transaction at all, before June 30. He also said NWA
agreed to give him 10 days notice if it decides to pursue certain
non-sale alternatives.
   Meanwhile, Northwest and its 5,000-member pilots union continued
negotiations Wednesday, according to Jim Halvorson, spokesman for
the Air Line Pilots Association. The talks resumed Tuesday for the
first time in about two weeks and were expected to continue through
Friday.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan to rescue the S&amp;L
industry faces potential challenges from two powerful House
committee chairmen after receiving a strong vote of support from
the banking panel.
   The House Banking Committee capped four days of debate by
approving the plan on a 49-2 vote Tuesday minutes before midnight.
The Senate had passed its own version of the bill last week.
   The legislation provides $157 billion over the next decade, most
of it from taxpayers, to close or merge more than 500 failed
institutions.
   It also would put S&amp;L regulators under more direct
administration control, increase spending to uncover fraud at S&amp;Ls
and, in the key reform, require S&amp;L owners to risk more of their
own capital when they make loans.
   The Bush administration is particularly pleased with the House
bill's capital provisions and is calling for Congress to swiftly
complete the legislative process and put a finished bill on the
president's desk.
   ``The risk now is delay,'' said Assistant Treasury Secretary
David W. Mullins, one of the architects of the Bush plan. The bill
has ``gone through so far without major changes. ... If someone
wanted to tinker with major components, we would argue that would
be unwarranted and very costly.''
   In a statement, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady indicated the
administration would be working to modify some provisions of the
bill passed by the House Banking Committee before the measure
clears Congress.
   Brady singled out changes in the administration's proposals for
setting up the Resolution Trust Corp., a new federal agency to
dispose of repossessed assets of insolvent S&amp;Ls, including a
provision which would require that some of the property be sold to
low-income people at a discount.
   ``We do have serious concerns about the nature and direction of
amendments which reconfigure the Resoution Trust Corp. The
committee has made substantial modifications which alter the
original design and intent of the administration proposal,'' Brady
said. ``We are particularly concerned about provisions that would
divert resources needed for savings and loan resolutions to housing
subsidies.''
   Staff aides to the banking committee are expected to take until
the end of next week to put the panel's bill in proper form and
write a report accompanying the legislation. Other committees with
an interest in parts of the measure would then get a week to
produce alternatives, leaving a slim chance that the full House
would before Memorial Day.
   Administration officials are also happy that both the Senate and
House, so far, have stuck with Bush's complicated mechanism for
keeping $50 billion in S&amp;L spending out of the budget deficit.
   However, both Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the House Ways and
Means Committee chairman, and Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the
chairman of the Rules Committee, disagree with major provisions of
the bill.
   Rostenkowski, in a speech last month, said he believes the Bush
financing mechanism wastes about $150 million a year because it
inflates the government's borrowing costs.
   He's being urged by Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of
the banking committee, to pursue the issue by including the S&amp;L
spending in the budget deficit, but exempting it from the automatic
cuts under Gramm-Rudman.
   ``If nothing else, Rostenkowski can push it and back off and
collect a few chits from the administration,'' said an industry
lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``He's got absolutely
nothing to lose. It makes him a player on a very important issue.''
   Pepper, whose panel governs debate on the House floor, is
pushing for looser capital rules, arguing that it is unfair to take
away accounting breaks given to S&amp;Ls in the early 1980s in exchange
for their takeover of ailing institutions.
   The legislation requires S&amp;L owners to risk $3 of ``real money''
or ``tangible'' capital for every $100 they lend _ double the
requirement of the bill passed by the Senate last month. The
capital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before government
deposit insurance kicks in.
   Pepper is likely to insist that the full House get a chance to
reconsider the capital provisions.

<HEAD>Cuomo Signs Poison Pill Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate directors will be able to use a
``poison pill'' to ward off unwanted takeover bids in New York
under a bill signed into law Wednesday by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   Companies in other states can enact a poison pill, or
anti-takeover plan, on their own. But legislation was needed in New
York because of a court decision last year that barred companies
from treating the shares of a would-be acquirer different from
those of other shareholders.
   The state had given that power to directors, but it expired
April 1.
   The new law gives boards of directors facing a hostile takeover
a chance to buy time to evaluate and react to the offers. By using
a poison pill, those directors could make it more expensive for an
outsider to buy a controlling portion of stock.
   At the same time, most poison pills allow stockholders of the
company to buy more shares at a cheaper price.
   The new law takes effect immediately and expires July 1. Between
now and then, Cuomo and the Legislature are expected to work on
some sort of permanent poison pill measure.
   Poison pills generally have been supported by management and
Fortune 500 companies while they largely have been opposed by the
securities industry and takeover entrepreneurs.
   ``Passage of this bill removes an incentive for people to leave
New York,'' said Robert Ward, spokesman for the Business Council,
the state's largest business lobbying group.
   The bill was approved unanimously in the Democratic-controlled
state Assembly earlier Wednesday.

<HEAD>Company Fined for Shipping Hazardous Waste Without Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANITE CITY, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Illinois waste-disposal company
shipped a barge containing toxic levels of lead and cadmium
overseas without required government approval, and the U.S.
government has proposed a $51,750 fine.
   Triangle Metallurgical Inc. of Granite City, which failed to get
Spain's permission to export the material, is the first company hit
with a fine under 1986 hazardous-waste export laws, the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported Wednesday.
   ``U.S. EPA is committed to ensuring that this country's
hazardous waste problems are not simply relocated to other
countries,'' said EPA Regional Administrator Valdus V. Adamkus, who
also proposed a $12,700 fine against Beelman Truck Co. of St.
Libory, which is accused of accepting the shipment without proper
documentation.
   The Triangle shipment to Spain was one of thousands last year by
businesses seeking to avoid the expense of complying with U.S.
hazardous-waste laws, the Post-Dispatch reported.
   But for Triangle, the matter did not end when the ship
containing its wastes docked this year in Bilbao, Spain.
   Under U.S. law, toxic-waste exporters must notify the EPA and,
working through the State Department, gain approval from the
importing nation before shipment.
   In Triangle's case, the company notified the EPA but the ship
set sail before Spanish approval was granted, the Post-Dispatch
said.
   Triangle President William T. Wegryzn acknowledged the materials
were not shipped with Spain's approval, but said he believed
notifying the EPA was sufficient.
   The materials were not highly toxic chemical wastes, said
officials of the company, which takes metal wastes from steel
mills, foundries and smelters and then resells them.
   On Dec. 28, about 750 cubic yards of metal waste and
contaminated dirt from a 1984 Triangle warehouse fire was trucked
to a barge on the Mississippi River and sent to Europe, the
newspaper said.
   The ship containing the waste arrived in Bilbao, Spain, on Feb.
11 and the waste was trucked to Er Cosa, a company that reclaims
copper.
   Er Cosa official Jose Antonio Boveda said government approval
was not required in Spain to receive the shipment he characterized
as routine.
   The law requiring approval of the receiving nation went into
effect in November 1986 _ the first U.S. step to address concerns
about toxic exports. Heavy fines and even jail sentences can be
imposed for willful violations.

<HEAD>Three Takeshita Ministers in Washington; Trade Hotline Plan Unveiled</HEAD>

   Japan's trade minister told U.S. officials
Tuesday his government plans to open trans-Pacific hotlines to help
American enterprises boost exports to his country, a Japanese
official reported.
   Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, minister of international trade and industry,
informed Commerce Secretary Edward Mosbacher of the project, said
Japanese Embassy spokesman Shingo Yamagami.
   Under the plan, U.S. exporters or potential exporters would be
invited to call in questions, problems or complaints directly to
the Tokyo MITI ministry, overseer of the country's global trade,
using circuits available at Japanese government commercial offices
in New York, Los Angeles and three other U.S. cities, he said.
   Complaints of Japanese import barriers and other red tape are a
major source of trade friction between the two countries,
aggravated by a U.S. trade deficit with Japan last year of $52
billion, which after a modest drop is again rising.
   Details such as whether the hotlines would be for voice
conversation or data exchange were not yet available, the spokesman
said. There was no immediate U.S. reaction.
   Japan, South Korea and other countries enjoying large trade
surpluses with America are lobbying vigorously to avoid being
targeted by the end of this month for potential retaliation under
1988 U.S. trade legislation.
   In another development, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III
was quoted by a Japanese official as warning Mitsuzuka that rising
U.S. protectionist pressure will increase tension between the
United States and Japan, challenging the two countries to manage
their relations more effectively in the coming years.
   Hideo Muraoka, deputy MITI minister, briefing Japanese
reporters, added that Baker was optimistic that ``effective and
proper management will be possible.''
   Three ministers of Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
cabinet were in Washington on Tuesday even though the prime
minister plans to resign later this month because of involvement in
an influence scandal.
   Besides Mitsuzuka they were Agriculture Minister Tsutomu Hata
and Masahisa Aoki, director-general of the Environment Protection
Agency.
   Officials of both governments said the visits were planned
before Takeshita announced he would step down, and reflected the
Japanese decision to conduct normal government operations during
the transition. Takeshita himself is on a previously-scheduled tour
of Southeast Asia.

<HEAD>House Banking Committee Approves Bush S&amp;L Bailout</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with committee vote.</HEAD>

   The House Banking Committee on Tuesday voted
49-2 approval of President Bush's proposal to spend $157 billion
over 10 years to bail out the savings and loan industry from what
has been described as the worst financial crisis since the
Depression.
   The bill also would put S&amp;L regulators under more direct
administration control, spend $75 million a year on investigating
and prosecuting fraud at S&amp;Ls and, in the key reform, require S&amp;L
owners to risk more of their own money when they make loans.
   The only dissenting votes, cast just before midnight after a
14-hour session, were from Reps. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., and Jim
Leach, R-Iowa. Kennedy said he would have preferred the bill to
provide more housing help for poor people and anti-discrimination
provisions. Leach said he wanted tougher capital standards.
   The legislation requires S&amp;L owners to risk $3 of ``real money''
or ``tangible'' capital for every $100 they lend _ double the
requirement of the bill passed by the Senate last month. The
capital would act as a buffer to absorb losses before government
deposit insurance kicks in.
   David W. Mullins, assistant secretary of the Treasury and one of
the Bush proposal's architects, praised the bill, saying, ``This
committee exceeded everyone's expectations. ... Despite all the
criticism of the Bush plan, the plain fact is it's gone through
pretty much intact.''
   ``This is a good bill. ... We all have reason to be proud,''
said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, the committee's chairman.
``We will move this bill on the fast track as fast as House rules
allow.''
   After the banking panel completes its report on the bill,
probably by the end of next week, at least two other committees _
Ways and Means and Judiciary _ will have one week to review
sections within their jurisdiction.
   Then, depending on how long the full House devotes to debate and
action, a joint House-Senate conference committee could resolve
differences between the two chambers and put the bill on the
president's desk by the July 4 recess, five months after Bush made
his proposal.
   The administration has endorsed the capital provisions of the
House bill, but Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., chairman of the Rules
Committee, is objecting, arguing it is unfair to take away capital
breaks given to S&amp;Ls in the early 1980s in exchange for their
takeover of ailing institutions.
   Pepper's committee sets the rules governing debate on the House
floor and committee members and their aides said they expect he
will insist the full House get the chance to amend the capital
standards.
   Most of the cost of the bailout will be born by taxpayers, the
rest by the S&amp;L industry. However, $50 billion of the spending in
the next three years will be excluded from the budget deficit
through a complicated plan for borrowing the money, helping Bush
meet his ``no new taxes pledge.''
   Two provisions in the House legislation, not adopted by the
Senate, are aimed at helping poor people obtain housing. One,
offered by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., and adopted 33-18, requires
the new government agency that will liquidate failed S&amp;Ls _ the
Resolution Trust Corp. _ to offer poor people and non-profit groups
at least a three-month option to buy low-priced residential
properties owned by failed S&amp;Ls.
   Two Republicans joined the 31 Democrats on the panel in passing
the amendment. The 18 Republicans opposing it argued that Frank's
proposal would dangerously restrict the government's ability to
sell property from failed S&amp;Ls, open the government to lawsuits and
eventually add to the taxpayer cost of the bailout.
   Frank, however, said his plan affected only $2 billion to $3
billion of the $200 billion to $300 billion in real estate the
government will inherit from sick institutions and argued that it
was a modest way to channel a few of the benefits of the massive
S&amp;L bill to the public.
   A provision offered by Gonzalez and adopted last week requires
the S&amp;L industry, through the regional Federal Home Loan Banks, to
provide $75 million a year to pay for reduced-rate mortgages for
poor people.
   However, the House panel on Tuesday defeated a pair of
amendments aimed at encouraging banks to do a better job of serving
poor people and minorities.
   On a 27-23 vote with seven Democrats joining all 20 Republicans,
the panel rejected an amendment by Gonzalez and Kennedy that would
have forced banks and S&amp;Ls to publicly disclose federal regulators'
ratings on how well they serve poor and minorities neighborhoods.
   By a 30-21 vote, with 10 Democrats joining 20 Republicans, it
voted against an amendment requiring regulators to report
information on mortgage lending by race, age and gender.
   ``If you think for a second that discrimination doesn't exist in
financial institutions, then we are living in Disney World, because
it happens every day,'' said Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y.
   Opponents said public disclosure of ratings kept by banking
regulators would be misinterpreted by depositors and used by civil
rights and community groups to create mischief.
   In other action Tuesday, the House committee:
   _Expanded the board overseeing the Resolution Trust Corp. from
three members to five members, including Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp and a private real estate expert.
   Bush had wanted a three-member board headed by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and including Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   The committee also added Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Chairman L. William Seidman as a non-voting member. He likely will
be in charge of the day-to-day task of administering the cleanup.
   _Voted 33-16 to adopt an amendment by Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., to
require banks and S&amp;Ls with assets of more than $150 million to
obtain independent audits of their financial condition.
   _Defeated, 26-23, an amendment by Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
that would have permitted regulators to revoke special accounting
breaks granted to acquirors of failed S&amp;Ls in 1988.
