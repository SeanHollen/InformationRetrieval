<HEAD>Restructuring of Army Planned In Wake Of Corruption Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military chief plans a major
restructuring of senior echelons of the army in the wake of
allegations of widespread corruption and inefficiency, newspapers
reported Sunday.
   Several major newspapers quoted unnamed sources as saying Chief
of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa announced the impending changes last
Friday during a closed-door session of the Senate's defense
committee.
   The Manila Bulletin, The Manila Times and the Philippine Daily
Inquirer, quoted de Villa as saying the shakeup would effect
regional and division commanders. No date was given for the shakeup,
but the papers said it was expected to be announced in a few weeks.
   The Inquirer quoted the defense committee chairman, Sen. Ernesto
Maceda, as telling his colleagues that if de Villa did not move
soon, he himself would open formal investigations into the
allegations of corruption.
   The calls for a shakeup in the senior ranks have increased
following a series of embarassing incidents. They include the
November escape of Communist rebel commander Romulo Kintanar from a
Manila stockade; the takeover of a military headquarters by renegade
policemen last January and the recent arrest of several police and
military officers on car theft charges in Manila.
   Last week, Maceda charged that unidentified generals and colonels
were receiving thousands of dollars annually from criminal
syndicates in return for shielding them from arrest.
   Maceda also challenged military claims that government forces
have gained the upper hand in the 20-year war against the communist
New People's Army.
   Ten senior officers, including army commander Maj. Gen. Mariano
Adalem, are scheduled to retire this year. But the newspapers said
the shakeup will affect many senior officers not scheduled for
retirement.

   Ruth Lemens awarded her 13-year-old son a
$500 check Saturday night for fulfilling a dare to go a year without
television.
   ``I'm just so proud of him,'' she said. ``That a teen-ager could
do that is fantastic.''
   Don, an eighth-grade student, described himself as a TV fanatic
when his parents offered him the challenge of purging the tube from
his life for 12 months.
   ``Bet you can't do that,'' Mrs. Lemens said she told him.
   Her husband, Mike, upped the ante with a $500 reward if he gave
up 365 days worth of his favorite cartoons, movies and situation
comedies. The time trial ended at 8:39 p.m. Saturday.
   Mrs. Lemens said the absence of TV allowed her son more time for
homework. While it didn't produce an improvement in his grades, she
said, he has shown more interest in reading and non-television
activities.
   Don said he plans to spend some of the money on stereo equipment
and put the rest in the bank. He said the money was not the chief
incentive.
   ``It was the challenge, not the money,'' he said. ``It helped me
to motivate myself and realize that you can do anything you want if
you try.''
   The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates
teen-agers watch an average of 21 hours of television a week. Don
said he was above that average before the challenge.
   While the rest of his family watched television, Don said he
would retreat to his room or to other diversions.
   ``I did my homework and read books, and in the summer I went
outside and played,'' he said.

   A federal judge on
Saturday doubled the bail of an accused cocaine trafficker who is a
key figure in the federal investigation of Washington Mayor Marion
Barry.
   Chief U.S. District Court Judge David V. O'Brien said new
information provided Saturday by the U.S. Attorney's Office in St.
Thomas prompted the increase in bail from $100,000 set late Friday
to $200,000.
   O'Brien said authorities had more than tripled their estimates of
the amount of cocaine involved in two sales allegedly made last week
by Charles Lewis.
   Earlier, W. Douglas Gow, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said
Lewis allegedly sold six to seven grams of the drug to agents on St.
Thomas and would be charged with two counts of distributing cocaine.
   Lewis remained jailed in St. Thomas on Saturday and was to appear
in court there Monday for a bail hearing.
   The judge said federal prosecutors have 30 days to file charges.
   An FBI statement said Lewis was arrested Friday after allegedly
attempting to sell agents the cocaine derivative ``crack'' twice
last week on St. Thomas.
   The 48-year-old St. Thomas resident allegedly sold five ``rocks''
to agents Thursday and another 20 on Friday just prior to his
arrest, according to court reports and the FBI release.
   O'Brien said he had set bail at $100,000 over the telephone
Friday on the ``bare-bones'' statement that both transactions
involved a total 25 pieces of crack.
   But he said the U.S. Attorney's Office informed him Saturday the
transaction actually involved 20 envelopes containing 85 pieces of
crack.
   The FBI report said that during the alleged buys, which it said
were recorded on video and audio tape, Lewis told agents he could
sell them ``pure cocaine'' that could be converted into crack.
   Lewis was the target of a Washington police investigation in
December when a maid at a local hotel claimed that he offered her
drugs in exchange for sex. Two district police officers went to the
hotel to try to buy drugs from Lewis, but the drug buy was called
off when the officers realized that Barry was visiting Lewis at the
time.
   A federal grand jury is now looking into the circumstances
surrounding Barry's visit to the hotel. A second investigation
involving both Lewis and Barry focuses on possible fraud in the
city's $260,000 joint personnel project with the Virgin Islands.

   Globe-trotting Secretary of State James
A. Baker III headed for Vienna on Saturday to plan his first trip to
Moscow and to launch new East-West arms control talks.
   Over three busy days, Baker will meet with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and separately with several NATO
ministers and will make a speech Monday to mark the opening of
negotiations between the Western alliance and the Warsaw Pact.
   Baker scheduled back-to-back meetings in Vienna on Sunday
afternoon with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi and Polish
Foreign Minister Marian Olechowski to get what a U.S. official
called ``a first-hand account of how reforms are going'' in the East
European countries and to determine ``where there may be opportunity
for U.S. cooperation.''
   On the flight to Vienna, with a refueling stop in Ireland, Baker
remained secluded in his sleeping quarters on the plane and did not
talk to the 17 reporters traveling with him.
   His session with Shevardnadze is expected to produce an agenda
for what would be Baker's first trip to the Soviet Union, probably
in late April or early May. It would mark a move by the Bush
administration to accelerate its review of policy toward Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Baker also assured two visiting delegations of American Jews on
Friday that human rights were on his agenda. Jewish emigration from
the Soviet Union is on the rise. Baker is expected to push for a
sustained exodus and expansion of religious freedoms.
   Gorbachev has been waging diplomatic initiatives in the Middle
East, Central America and on the arms control front while U.S.
policy remains under review and President Bush and Baker take their
time filling several vacant posts at the State Department.
   Baker is due to fly home Tuesday, while the negotiations between
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact open
Thursday. His speech will be searched for hints of evolving U.S.
policy on several fronts.
   The NATO allies, under U.S. leadership, are pushing for sharp
reductions in the Warsaw Pact's edge of nearly 2-to-1 in tanks and
artillery. Their goal is to force the Soviet-led alliance down to
NATO levels and then cut about 5 percent to 10 percent on both sides.
   East and West are starting over after 15 years of futile
negotiations to reduce non-nuclear forces in Central Europe. They
have broadened their horizons to cover the entire expanse of the
continent _ from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the
Soviet Union.
   All 35 nations that signed the 1975 Helsinki agreement to reduce
East-West tensions are involved, but the actual negotiations will be
conducted by the 16-nation NATO and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
   While Baker is in Vienna, he will compare notes with the other
NATO foreign ministers, who are expecting a report on prospects for
a new U.S. diplomatic initiative to resolve the Arab-Israeli
conflict. They are also interested in evolving U.S. policy in
Central America.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
arrived Sunday for meetings with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and other NATO officials in a prelude to new European
talks on cutting conventional arms.
   Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock and U.S. Ambassador Henry A.
Grunwald welcomed at Baker at Vienna's Schwechat airport. He made no

   Over three busy days, Baker will meet with Shevardnadze and

<HEAD>Quake Aftershock At Grand Canyon; Quake Reported In Washington State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND CANYON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake that shook Grand
Canyon National Park on Saturday was followed by a moderate
aftershock about nine hours later, but neither caused any damage or
injury, officials said.
   Also late Saturday, an earthquake centered 40 miles northwest of
Seattle was felt over a large area of western Washington state.
   The Arizona aftershock was recorded at a preliminary magnitude of
3.9 on the Richter scale of ground motion at 2:18 a.m., said U.S.
Geological Survey spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson in Menlo Park, Calif.
   The epicenter of the quake was near Grand Canyon Village, about
60 miles northwest of Flagstaff, she said.
   Saturday's temblor at 5:41 p.m. had a preliminary magnitude of
4.0, said Don Finley, a Geological Survey spokesman in Washington,
D.C.
   ``It was very quick,'' Park Service spokesman Chuck Lundy said of
the Saturday quake. ``It probably lasted only five or six seconds.
We could hear the glasses rattling in the cupboard, and you could
feel the ground rumble and shudder.''
   In Washington state, a moderate earthquake that shook the region
at 10:42 p.m. was felt as far north as Vancouver, British Columbia,
Ms. Jorgenson said.
   That temblor, with an epicenter in the Olympic Peninsula 40 miles
northwest of Seattle, was recorded with a preliminary magnitude of
4.4 on the Richter scale, she said.
   No damage or injuries were reported as a result of the quake, she
added.
   The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Each increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

   A hit-and-run bus accident touched off a
clash between police and people armed with broken bottles and
stones, and four people were shot to death and five injured,
authorities said Sunday.
   Police said the riot occurred Friday night when a bus driver
trying to escape a traffic policeman ran down and killed a commuter.
   Youths in the area of central Lagos began attacking police and
government vehicles, injuring five policemen, one of them
critically, police said.
   Riot police sent to the scene were greeted by rocks and bottles
thrown from behind a barracade erected by the rioters, police said.
   Authorities fired tear gas and pistols to break up the riot.
Police said four people died from bullet wounds.
   Last month a policeman was sentenced to death for killing two men
involved in a traffic dispute. That traffic accident caused riots
that left eight people dead.

   The Irish Republican Army, the mainly Roman Catholic organization

   Police said the blast damaged Girdwood military barracks and

   A joint army and police unit had just left the barracks to patrol
on foot when the bomb exploded, said a police press officer who

   Most seriously injured was a police officer whose leg was broken,

   A veteran of the Imperial Army who had planned to
commit suicide the day of Emperor Hirohito's funeral instead killed
himself last week to avoid interfering with the funeral, police said
Sunday.
   Toshio Muratani, 66, shot himself in the head with a pistol in a
Tokyo park Friday, a police spokesman said.
   The victim left a note saying he delayed his suicide until after
Hirohito's funeral so he would not ``inconvenience any parties
concerned,'' said the policeman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Muratani served as a lieutenant in the Japanese Imperial Army
during World War II. Japan fought the war in the name of the emperor.
   Hirohito, who died of cancer, was buried Feb. 24 in an elaborate
funeral attended by world leaders, including President Bush.
   Two former Japanese soldiers committed suicide to follow Hirohito
in death, earlier police reports said.
   Another veteran tried to kill himself on the southern island of
Kyushu by ritual disembowelment but survived. A police spokesman
said Sunday the veteran was ``doing well'' but was still
hospitalized with a cut through his small intestine.

   Rumors that a devil-worshiping

   Police Capt. Nonito Gader dismissed the reported cult as a hoax
perpetrated by ``drug addicts or pranksters.'' He said surveillance
of several neighborhoods in Zamboanga failed to turn up evidence of
devil worship.
   The rumors surfaced after leaflets describing a cult turned up in
schools, markets and even government offices in this southern city
of 500,000 people. The leaflets, allegedly from the United Satanic
Evil Design, include a list of the cult's holy days as well as
secret signs to identify members.
   Unconfirmed word spread, however, that the cult is kidnapping
women and children for rituals.
   Mystical religious cults are widespread in the Philippines.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of China's official women's organization
denounced sex discrimination in the work place and politics and
urged new efforts to fight it, an official report said Sunday.
   Chen Muhua, former head of the Bank of China and head of the
All-China Women's Federation, used unusually strong language in her
remarks.
   She said the federation should ``justly and forcefully call out
to fight for women's legal rights and interests,'' the People's
Daily said.
   ``To meet the new demands of the historical era, the Women's
Federation should reform its work and raise the women's liberation
movement to a new level,'' the Communist Party newspaper quoted Ms.
Chen as saying in an interview with the magazine ``Party Building.''
   Officials generally argue there is no need for a women's
liberation movement in China. They say the entire population, women
included, was liberated in 1949 when the Communists took power.
   However, the Women's Federation has become increasingly outspoken
in recent months. During that time, growing economic competition
encouraged by senior leader Deng Xiaoping has been used as a reason
for firing or not hiring women or denying them scarce university
seats.
   ``Many women workers have been fired as industries form
`high-quality labor groups' or sign contracts with their workers,''
the paper quoted Ms. Chen as saying. ``There are economic reasons
for this, but it also has to do with attitude.''
   The labor groups are one of the recent reform moves, involving
reorganizing work forces into more efficient units and firing the
unqualified. Official statistics indicate a majority of those fired
are women.
   Ms. Chen said one reason for that problem is that factories don't
want to pay maternity leave.
   She was also quoted as saying women's representation in
government is ``extremely low,'' with women making up only one-fifth
of the 2,976 delegates to the National People's Congress, the
legislature.
   According to Ms. Chen, discrimination often begins at birth and
is reflected in a growing gap between boys and girls in officially
registered births.
   Recent figures indicate more than 110 boy babies are registered
for every 100 girls.
   She did not say whether she believed girl babies were not being
registered or if they were being aborted or killed after birth.
   Chinese families traditionally have preferred boys to girls,
believing boys are more valuable as farm laborers and as supporters
of their parents in old age.
   The government limits most families to only one child in an
effort to limit the country's population. But some local
authorities, bowing to popular pressure, allow families to have a
second child if the first one is a girl.

   Leaving desk-bound bureaucrats behind, Larry
Morrison has risen high in his government career, a man you can
really look up to.
   He's the guy who changes light bulbs at the top of the Washington
Monument.
   Every week or so, Morrison climbs a ladder about 515 feet above
ground to install a fresh bulb in the set of eight red airplane
warning lights that blink unceasingly at the apex of the popular
tourist attraction.
   Nothing to it, says Morrison, a 23-year veteran electrician for
the National Park Service.
   After all, Morrison works inside the monument, behind
18-inch-thick walls of granite and marble. He perches 15 feet above
the observation deck atop an aluminum extension ladder held steady
by an assistant.
   When he demonstrated his lofty job late last week, Morrison had
Raymond Hall, master Park Service electrician for the Washington
region, as his supervisor.
   Although the Washington Monument sways slightly in a stiff wind,
Morrison says the only time he feels queasy is when he climbs
outdoor scaffolding with the ``weebles and wobbles'' to change light
bulbs above the columns of the Lincoln Memorial.
   The bulbs that Morrison replaces at the Washington Monument are
500-watt spotlights that cost $70 apiece and last about a week or
two. They flash on and off continually from four pairs of holes on
each side of the pyramid-shaped monument peak.
   No airplane has ever struck the 555-foot Washington Monument,
which occupies airspace that is off-limits to planes landing or
taking off at nearby National Airport.
   However, seven people have died in suicides or accidental falls
down the monument's observation windows or elevator shaft since it
was opened to the public on Oct. 9, 1888.
   Bars were installed in the narrow windows on the 500-foot level
after they were used for the last two suicide leaps in 1926. Thick
safety glass was installed later. A high metal grill was erected
above the guard rail alongside the monument's 897 steps after the
last suicide down the shaft occurred in 1949.
   The inner stairway was closed to the public in 1976, except for
escorted tours downs the steps, because of vandalism and growing
congestion.
   An eighth death occurred at the monument in December 1982 when
police shot and killed Norman Mayer, an anti-nuclear demonstrator
who held the monument hostage for 10 hours claiming he would blow it
up with dynamite.
   Ironically, no one was killed during the entire 36 years it took
to build the monument.

<HEAD>Politburo Report on Agriculture Plays Down Importance of Leasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet leadership, preparing for an important
meeting on agriculture, has given short shrift to President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's campaign to lease more state-owned farmland to
private groups.
   In last week's two-day Poliburo meeting, the 12-member ruling
body referred to leasing as only one of many forms of management it
said were necessary to ease chronic Soviet food shortages, Pravda
reported Saturday.
   And in a speech in the Siberian city of Omsk, the head of the
Communist Party's commission for agriculture, Yegor K. Ligachev,
also made only one mention of leasing. His speech was carried Friday
by Pravda, the Communist Party daily.
   Ligachev, reputedly a conservative force on the Politburo, opted
instead for more traditional formulas calling for increased
investment to better life in villages and to modernize farm
machinery and technology.
   Gorbachev in October said the Kremlin leadership had decided to
extend ``to the whole of agriculture'' an experiment that leased
collective farmland to small groups and families, who would choose
their crops and keep most of the profits.
   Farmers, he said in a speech, must again become ``complete
masters'' of the land.
   With the exception of small garden plots tilled by individual
citizens, all farmland is state-owned in the Soviet Union. Since the
bloody drive launched by dictator Josef V. Stalin in 1929 to
eliminate the independent peasantry, the mainstays of the Soviet
agricultural system have been the ``kolkhozes,'' or collective
farms, and the ``sovkhozes,'' or state-owned farms.
   A leasing system runs counter to Marxist-Leninist theory, which
holds that a socialist form of ownership, such as the collective
farms, is a higher and more efficient form of organization than
private farming.
   Any changes would threaten the entrenched bureaucracy that runs
the collective and state-owned farms and the sprawling superministry
of agriculture.
   Gorbachev, the son of a Russian peasant, has not called for the
dismantlement of collective or state farms, which have been run for
decades like factories, with orders from Moscow on what and when to
plant handed down to the wage earners who work the fields. But he
said in October the practice of paying them ``unearned money'' had
to stop.
   In the past 20 years, he said, capital investment in the
agriculture sector rose 140 percent, but production increased only
41 percent. In contrast, Gorbachev said, dairy farms run on the
leasing system produce more milk per cow than ordinary farms.
   But Gorbachev acknowledged in January that the leasing campaign
ran into opposition from bureaucrats and collective farmers, who
view those who enroll in it as latter-day descendants of the
``kulaks,'' or rich peasants.
   ``Leasing is proceeding with difficulty, and thus many people,
the innovators, are being called kulaks and Rockefellers,'' he said.
``Many people, especially the lazy, don't like the fact that leasing
is destroying the ... habits of the years of stagnation, when you
could get a good salary no matter how you worked.''
   Gorbachev said a law was being drafted to prepare the interests
of farmers who entered into long-term leases.
   The Politburo, preparing for a meeting of the party's
policy-making Central Committee on agriculture later this month,
said it supported the creation of ``multiple forms of ownership and
types of management _ of kolkhozes, sovkhozes, agro-industrial
amalgamations, processing enterprises, leasees, members of
cooperatives, leasing collectives, farmsteads, personal farmplots of
citizens,'' Pravda said.
   In Omsk, Ligachev used similar language, calling for the ``spread
of different organizational forms of production, based on
self-accounting, the brigade and lease relations, cooperatives and
also the democratization of management on all levels,'' Pravda said.
   The Politburo report did not say when the Central Committee would
meet again, but at its last plenum in January, the 300-plus member
body announced it would hold a plenary session March 15-16.

<HEAD>Venezuelan Riots Point Up Questionable Blessings of Oil Wealth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bloody riots in Venezuela this week
highlight a question that has puzzled political analysts since the
oil price spirals of the 1970s: What did the billions in oil income
buy for the poorer exporting countries?
   The full answer is not yet clear, but a new study by a World Bank
economist concludes that for some countries, including Venezuela,
the wealth was wasted.
   Venezuela and its fellow OPEC members were the chief
beneficiaries _ at least temporarily _ of the oil supply disruptions
of 1973 and 1979 that pushed prices from less than $2 a barrel to
nearly $40. The immediate losers were the United States and other
oil-importing nations, which suffered a prolonged economic slump.
   A decade after the last oil price shock that was triggered by the
1979 Iranian revolution, economists and political scientists are
still trying to determine what happened to the mountains of oil
income earned by the exporters.
   So, too, in a less academic way, are people in the slums of
Caracas, the Venezuelan capital. Riots that began there on Monday
claimed at least 200 lives in a crisis triggered by new government
austerity measures, including increases in gasoline prices and
transit fares. Martial law was imposed on Tuesday.
   A few analysts have been saying for years that the oil exporters'
wealth was squandered and that most members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries may be worse off today than before
they began reaping the richest trade returns in history. But their
judgments lacked a longer perspective on how the OPEC economies have
performed.
   Now, the World Bank's Alan Gelb, in his new book ``Oil Windfalls:
Blessing or Curse?'' has provided a comprehensive and detailed
analysis of the oil boom fallout.
   His conclusion: Most of the oil exporting nations are worse off
now than before the boom, making the decade of oil windfalls a
massive net loss for the whole world.
   The troubles for the oil exporters have been made much worse, of
course, by the steep fall in oil prices since 1986, from $30 a
barrel to roughly $15 a barrel now. During the 1970s, it was widely
believed worldwide that prices would keep rising.
   Gelb, a senior financial economist at the World Bank, focuses on
five OPEC members: Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and
Ecuador, plus non-OPEC member Trinidad and Tobago.
   He says that of these six, only Indonesia succeeded in using its
1970s oil wealth to strengthen its overall economy, mainly by
improving its agricultural sector.
   Nigeria probably fared the worst, Gelb says. By the mid-1980s,
Nigerians' overall standard of living was lower than before the
boom, he concludes.
   As a measure of Nigeria's failures, Gelb writes that in 1972-84,
the economy grew at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent despite
the largest investment boom in the nation's history. By contrast, in
the six years prior to the 1973 oil price spiral, Nigerian economic
growth averaged 9.2 percent a year.
   Gelb adds, however, that despite the massive waste of oil income
on such failed projects as steel factories, Nigeria did spend wisely
to improve primary education.
   One of the chief reasons for the economic problems resulting from
the oil boom in these six countries, Gelb says, was the speed at
which oil wealth grew. In Indonesia, for example, oil export income
soared more than fourfold at the start of the boom, from $641
million in 1973 to $2.64 billion the following year.
   The governments, which own the national oil monopolies, felt
compelled to spend the money rapidly in order to demonstrate to
their publics that it was not being hoarded or extorted, Gelb says.
This often led to overly risky investments and too little attention
to the need for basic economic changes such as tax reform.
   ``Oil exporters ended the period worse off than they would have
been with a far lower, more predictable rate of increase in oil
prices or, indeed, with constant real oil prices,'' Gelb writes.
   Venezuela, unlike many of the other oil exporters, was more
cautious in spending its oil windfall, perhaps out of respect for
the views of Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso, who helped create OPEC in
1960. He once called oil ``the devil's excrement'' and said, ``It
brings trouble.''
   In the early years after the 1973 price boom, which was triggered
by the Arab oil embargo, the Venezuelan government created the
Venezuelan Investment Fund to manage the money it saved abroad. By
1978 the nation's accounts with the rest of the world were in
balance. Today its foreign debt of $33 billion is fourth largest in
Latin America.
   In 1979, at the start of the second oil boom, Venezuela's private
investment began to fall, in part because of what Gelb calls
inconsistent government policies. Money began flowing out of the
country. Subsidies fell. Unemployment grew.
   ``The overall picture that emerges is one of a dramatic failure
of economic policy under complex yet seemingly exceptionally
favorable conditions,'' Gelb writes. ``Nothing appears to have been
gained from the windfalls...''

   Many of Ferdinand Marcos' fellow
northerners are clamoring for his return from exile and insisting
his death abroad could deepen their estrangement from the government
of President Corazon Aquino.
   ``There's going to be war,'' said Chit Guarin, a 27-year-old
medical technician who works near this village named in honor of the
favorite son of Ilocos Norte province. ``This is his home. Besides,
he is very bright, and he gave us a lot.''
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow Marcos, who was born in the
Ilocos Norte town of Sarrat, to return from exile in Hawaii, despite
claims from his family that the former president may soon die.
Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized since January with heart and
respiratory ailments.
   Here in Ilocos Norte and other Ilocano-speaking areas of the
north, the former president is still widely viewed as a hero.
   ``He is a blood brother and a province mate,'' said Pacita Juan,
46, a farmer.
   ``Many will become rebels (if Marcos dies in exile),'' said
Felicito Tamayo, mayor of the town of Marcos, which includes
Ferdinand village.
   Their views highlight the political estrangement many of the 6
million Ilocanos, the third-largest of more than 80 language groups
in the country, feel toward Mrs. Aquino.
   Government officials in Manila, 240 miles to the south, say most
Filipinos agree with Mrs. Aquino's stand toward Marcos, which she
says is based on national security. Marcos has lived in Hawaii since
he was overthrown in a popular uprising that swept Mrs. Aquino to
power three years ago.
   In Manila and other parts of this island nation, people generally
express contempt for Marcos.
   Many in this region, however, believe Marcos won the
fraud-tainted 1986 election against Mrs. Aquino, which was held
about two weeks before the uprising. In Ferdinand, which has about
400 residents, Mrs. Aquino received 10 votes in 1986.
   Residents said they were stunned by the news in 1986 their leader
was gone.
   ``Old people wept,'' recalled Junel Rosqueta, 20. ``They said,
`Marcos is gone; when will be come back?' All of them went to hear
Mass and to pray.''
   Melecio Duldulao, a village leader, said Ilocanos had come to
believe Marcos ``was president-for-life.''
   ``I had gotten used to him,'' he said. ``We have lost hope that
he will still be president now.''
   However, most people in this region say they accept the new
government while believing Marcos should be allowed to die here.
   ``It's not a question of being an Ilocano. It's a question of
being a Christian,'' said the Rev. Rock Bonoan, spokesman of the
Roman Catholic archdiocese. ``I would prefer that he (Marcos) be
given the chance to come back and die in his country. He is already
powerless. I don't see why many people are so afraid.''
   At the Marcos Agro-Industrial School, a state-funded elementary
and high school, fourth-grade students were asked if they wanted
Marcos to return. ``Yes!'' they shouted in unison.
   ``Marcos is not the cheater. Cory is the cheater,'' said
11-year-old Dennis Mamayan, referring to Mrs. Aquino by her nickname.
   ``We don't want what Cory is doing to Marcos. She is trying to
picture Marcos as a thief,'' said Arnel Ramirez, 7.
   Adults here fondly recall a visit Marcos paid to their remote,
mountain village during the 1950s when he was a member of the
Senate. Others recall the public works projects he provided for his
home province.
   ``Before 1963, no vehicles entered our place,'' said Helen
Abrigado. ``But after that, we had roads and electricity.''
   Most people interviewed brushed aside government allegations
Marcos embezzled billions of dollars during his administration.
Others said they did not care because Marcos boosted the province's
economic development.

<HEAD>Eastern: Pilots Crippling Themselves, Airline, By Honoring IAM Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines pilots, who have virtually shut
down the carrier by honoring the picket lines of striking
Machinists, are risking not only their careers but the existence of
the airline, a company spokesman said Sunday.
   ``By continuing to stay out, the pilots are committing economic
suicide,'' spokesman Robin Matell said at a late-morning news
briefing discussing the effects of the Machinists union strike, in
its second day Sunday.
   ``This is a pilot's strike. There should be no mistake about
that, and it's a pontentially tragic mistake,'' Matell said.
   ``It places 3,600 pilot careers in jeopardy and it risks the very
existance of a great airline,'' he said. ``But maybe, just maybe,
it's not too late.''
   Matell said that about 150 pilots had crossed the picket lines
Saturday, and said there were indications more would work Sunday.
   Eastern was able to get only 85 of its normal 1,000 Saturday
flights into the air because the pilots couldn't be matched with
available aircraft quickly enough, Matell said.
   Eastern expected to fly 125 flights Sunday, and had managed to
get 12 up by 10 a.m., he said.
   Eastern managers thought they had prepared for the stike by
hiring non-unionists and slashing the weekend schedule by up to 75
percent, but those plans ripped apart when most pilots and flight
attendants honored picket lines.
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for the pilots union, had said Saturday
that ``It's very clear the airline isn't going to fly without us.''
   Meanwhile, sympathizers across the country were mobilizing for
massive pickets Monday that threatened rush-hour nightmares,
especially in the congested New York metropolitan area. Strikers
planned picketing at commuter railroads and received assurances that
no rail workers would cross their lines.
   The walkout that began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday by 8,500 mechanics,
bag handlers and ground crews escalated a 17-month union-management
battle at the nation's seventh-largest airline, which ordinarily
schedules more than 1,000 flights with 100,000 passengers daily.
   Both sides were deadlocked on $150 million in wage concessions
that company boss Frank Lorenzo demanded. Talks collapsed in
Washington at midnight Friday and no new discussions were planned.
   The main target of the striker hostility was Lorenzo, head of
Texas Air Corp., which bought Eastern in 1986.
   He is widely mistrusted by Eastern workers because of what they
call his triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrier
Continental Airlines in 1983. Many accuse him of provoking the
strike to do the same at Eastern.
   Battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in the
deregulated airline business, Eastern has racked up nearly $2.5
billion in debt and claims to be losing more than $1 million a day.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the Senate rejects John Tower as defense
secretary, the White House is expected to move quickly to name a
replacement, even though it isn't acknowledging the possibility of
defeat.
   ``The president has told his staff and has told the nation that
he's not talking about successors, he's talking about getting his
nomination confirmed,'' said White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   Still, administration aides and congressional sources say
privately that the president is mindful of the odds against winning
Tower's confirmation; and that the White House is determined not to
be caught off balance.
   The speculation is that Bush's would select a candidate who could
be confirmed quickly _ either someone now in government or someone
who in the recent past had been a Cabinet or sub-Cabinet official.
   Some Republicans in Congress have been pressing Bush to give the
job to his National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, who is widely
respected on both sides of the aisle.
   In fact, if Bush was determined to keep Tower as part of his
administration, he could do a job swap, giving him Scowcroft's
present job _ which does not require Senate confirmation and which
is not in the military line of command.
   Although Scowcroft's name has been heard most frequently in
recent White House speculation, there is no shortage of candidates.
   Among them:
   _ Sen. John Warner of Virginia, senior Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee. A former secretary of the Navy, Warner
would sail through the Senate if nominated. However, a big political
minus to Republicans would be the loss of a Senate seat, since
Democratic Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles would surely fill the
vacancy with a member of his own party.
   _Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Now a corporate
executive, Rumsfeld was former President Ford's defense secretary in
1975-77. He is mentioned frequently as a likely contender for the
post, but his support of Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas against Bush in
last year's Republican primaries could work against him.
   _Former Rep. Jack Edwards of Alabama. He was the senior
Republican on the Appropriations defense subcommittee for many years
and was highly regarded for his knowledge of the defense budget and
for his skill in arguing defense issues.
   _Drew Lewis, former Transportation Secretary. The president of
Union Pacific Corp. has become a GOP workhorse with a string of
high-level assignments and would bring a management perspective to
the job. He was in President Reagan's first Cabinet and most
recently was co-chairman of the Federal Economic Commission, which
tried to tackle the problem of the budget deficit.
   _Norman Augustine, chief executive officer of Martin-Marietta
Corp. He reportedly was offered, and turned down, the chance to be
deputy defense secretary, but might view the No. 1 spot differently.
He has been involved in developing various proposals for defense
modernization. However, his lack of previous government service
could be a liability.
   When asked whether Bush has considered alternatives, whether
anyone on his staff has considered alternatives, or whether the
White House personnel office has done any preliminary work in such a
direction, Fitzwater is emphatic.
   ``To my knowledge and under every instruction that I've been
given by everybody of any authority, the answer to that no, no, no
and no,'' says the presidential spokesman.
   But analysts and leading Republicans in Congress suggest
otherwise.
   ``If there hasn't been at least one session in the Oval Office to
bat around alternatives to Tower, then they're nuts. They've got to
have a contingency plan,'' said Norman Ornstein of the conservative
American Enterprise Institute.
   ``George Bush has to come forward with someone very quickly who
can be confirmed quickly,'' if Tower loses, Ornstein said,
suggesting that additional delays in getting his defense team in
place are ``the last thing he wants to do.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, D-Texas, an outspoken Tower defender, said he
believed ``several people'' might be considered as backup candidates
for Tower, but that the White House has given no signal it is
wavering in its support for Tower.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., a former member of the House Armed
Services Committee who was a top Bush campaign adviser, said she
assumes the president's senior staff has given consideration to a
successor to Tower even if Bush has not.
   ``Of course, they'll have alternatives ready. That's what staff
is for,'' she said in an interview. ``You always plan to the
possibility of losing.''
   Mrs. Martin said Bush was entirely proper in forbidding his staff
to talk about possible backup candidates. ``It is not the
appropriate time,'' she said.

<HEAD>Congress To Focus On Tower Nomination, Wright Ethics Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fledgling 101st Congress, with no major
legislation to consider, will be dominated this week by highly
partisan squabbles _ one behind tightly sealed doors and the other
in the glare of television.
   The only significant legislative activity will come in the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee, which will begin writing a bill
to raise the $3.35 minimum wage to at least $4.25 and perhaps as
much as $4.65 an hour.
   The Bush administration supports an increase to no more than
$4.25 _ and only then if workers are exempted until they have been
on the job for at least six months.
   With the nation looking on, the Democratic-controlled Senate will
resume debate Monday on the nomination of former Sen. John G. Tower,
a Republican, to be secretary of defense. A final vote is likely
this week, and despite President Bush's pleas, no Democrat has
announced support for Tower. No Republican has come out against him.
   On the other side of the Capitol, a 12-member committee evenly
divided between the two parties will attempt to wrap up its
investigation of House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, the most
powerful Democrat in government. The ethics committee has been
looking into Wright's behavior for nine months, and has diligently
guarded against news leaks of its private discussions.
   The panel is considering six allegations against Wright. Most of
the attention has centered on assertions that he improperly used his
office to produce and sell a book on which he made $55,000, in part
by selling the book to special interests. He also is accused of
having lobbied improperly on behalf of Texas savings institutions.
   The speaker says he is confident that he will be vindicated.
   A finding that Wright violated House ethics standards would send
the matter to the full House. Regardless of the outcome, Republicans
already have vowed that Wright will be their chief target in the
1990 elections.
   A Senate vote against Tower would make history. Never before has
the Senate rejected the Cabinet nominee of a president entering his
first term.
   Tower, an acknowledged expert on military matters, is under fire
for what some senators view as a drinking problem and because be
sold his advice to the defense industry after leaving government as
a senior arms negotiator.
   Tower, a former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
served 23{ years in the Senate. The depth of his problem became
clear when all 11 Democrats on the panel opposed him and only the 9
Republicans voted for him.
   Another Bush nominee, former Education Secretary William Bennett,
is likely to have a much easier time.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Thursday to
recommend confirmation of Bennett to head the federal government's
battle against illegal drugs.
   Bennett, who has the warm endorsement of Sen. Joseph Biden Jr.,
D-Del., chairman of the committee, told the panel he plans to target
casual drug users as well as drug distributors.
   The Senate will vote Tuesday on confirming career diplomat Thomas
Pickering to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
   Pickering has faced some criticism because while serving as
ambassador to Israel, he received a document from a Central American
leader offering $1 million worth of military equipment to the rebels
fighting the leftist government in Nicaragua. The letter, received
at a time when the law barred U.S. military aid to the rebels, was
delivered directly by Pickering to National Security Council aide
Oliver North.
   Until committees begin churning out legislation, Congress has
little to do except nominations and housekeeping measures.
   Leaders of Congress and the Bush administration may begin
negotiations late in the week aimed at producing a budget for the 12
months that begin next Oct. 1.
   Bush has proposed a $1.16 trillion spending plan that he says
would reduce the budget deficit below the $100 billion maximum
allowed by law. Democrats complain that the president's plan leaves
to Congress the tough decisions on which programs to cut to meet
that deficit target.
   Hanging over the budget discussions is Bush's pledge not to raise
taxes. Democratic leaders say any workable plan must include some
tax increases but they are not about to take the first step unless
they are joined by the president.

   Will Bryant Gumbel say anything about the
anti-Willard memo?
   Viewers of NBC's ``Today'' show will find out Monday when Gumbel
returns to the air after a week of vacation in Palm Springs, Calif.
He's been silent so far; asked to comment Friday, Gumbel replied,
``not a chance, not a chance.''
   The private memo was leaked last week to New York Newsday and
included some pretty blunt criticisms of Gumbel's on-air colleagues.
   Gumbel especially was blunt about ``Today'' weather forecaster
Willard Scott for using time on the No. 1-rated morning show to
offer homey birthday greetings and plug charity events. Scott,
Gumbel said, ``holds the show hostage to his assortment of whims,
wishes and bad taste.''
   The memo, to ``Today'' executive producer Marty Ryan, was written
last August. Sources apparently retrieved it from Gumbel's computer
file.
   Scott suggested last week that if he can't work a reconciliation
with Gumbel, ``I don't think I belong here.''
   Gumbel's co-host, Jane Pauley, who was not mentioned in the memo,
suggested everyone ``lighten up.''
   ``Sure it was a problem, but every family has its ups and
downs,'' she said.
   Other ``Today'' show personalities who were subject to Gumbel's
grumbles included movie reviewer Gene Shalit (his reviews ``are
often late and his interviews aren't very good'') and consumer
reporter David Horowitz (``a walking cliche'').

   British rock star Sting, who has
said he will lead a campaign to preserve the Amazon rain forest,
says the destruction of the jungle is tied to Brazil's $121 billion
foreign debt.
   The Brazilian government claims it must develop the Amazon to pay
off its huge debt. But development equals environmental destruction,
critics say.
   ``The truth is that the world is in debt to Brazil, not the
contrary,'' Sting said in an interview published Sunday in Rio's
Jornal do Brasil newspaper. ``The United States and Europe produce
more dollars and Brazil produces more air. It's a question of how
you value things. I personally value air more.''
   He said that ``the foreign debt and rain forest destruction are
linked'' because the country's debt-induced poverty ``forces people,
who live at the margins of existence, to go to the forests out of
necessity.''
   Sting said he believed the foundation he established to help save
the Amazon ``will be useful in influencing public opinion in the
United States and Europe to reduce the paying back of the debt.''

   Singer Willie Nelson and former President
Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, are the drawing cards for two
fund-raising events on April 2 that will benefit some of Austin's
homeless.
   The funds will be channeled through Habitat for Humanity, an
organization that has spread to more than 300 U.S. cities and more
than 25 foreign countries since it started more than 10 years ago.
Habitat for Humanity renovates or builds homes for needy families
around the world. Carter is a board member of the organization,
which is based in Americus, Ga.
   The Rev. Gerald Mann, pastor of the 3,000-member Riverbend
Baptist Church, said 90 percent of the events' proceeds will be used
locally and 10 percent will be used to build homes in foreign
countries.
   The fund-raising will start with a $100-per-ticket reception,
limited to 250 people. Among the sponsors will be Lady Bird Johnson,
wife of the late President Lyndon Johnson.
   Later, 100 members of the Riverbend chorus will perform with a
27-piece orchestra. Carter will speak and Nelson will sing.

   Actor Hal Holbrook is planning to expand
the horizons of his career when he directs his first movie later
this year.
   Beginning May 1, Holbrook will direct ``Staggerwing'' on location
in northwest Arkansas.
   ``It's a whole career change,'' Holbrook said in an interview
while in Memphis with his one-man show about Mark Twain.
   He said the film is spun from a true story of a mastermind
criminal and will star David Strathairn, with a screenplay by Harry
Minetree. Filming will take place in Fayetteville and Bentonville,
Ark.
   ``What attracted me initially was the fact that Harry's script
has a beginning, a middle and an end, and that's rare enough these
days,'' Holbrook said. ``And it's full of so many wonderfully rich
characters.''
   Holbrook credited his second wife, actress Dixie Carter, with the
move toward directing.
   ``She's pushing me onwards into new efforts. She thinks any movie
I direct will be an instant, fabulous success,'' he said.

   The only house built in the Motor City by
pioneering architect Frank Lloyd Wright has been put up for sale by
Domino's Pizza Inc. owner Thomas Monaghan, who decided not to
restore the home.
   Monaghan, a collector of Wright's work who bought the house a
year ago, has listed the cement-block building on Detroit's north
side for $295,000. The original purchase price was not disclosed.
   The house was designed in the 1950s for a prominent local
attorney. Wright died in 1959.
   Domino's bought it with the intention of restoring it and loaning
it to the University of Detroit, a company spokesman said Friday.
   But Monaghan scrapped the project because of a commitment to
building a new Wright museum at Domino's Farms, the company's
headquarters near Ann Arbor, the spokesman said.

   A court has sentenced three men to
life imprisonment for the 1983 killing of an assistant state
prosecutor who was investigating the Mafia.
   One of them, Antonio Salvatore Minore, is a reputed Mafia figure
who is a fugitive. He was convicted and sentenced Saturday for
ordering the killing of Giangiacomo Ciaccio Montaldo.
   The Caltanisetta court sentenced Ambrogio Farina and Natale Evola
for carrying out the killing.
   The court sentenced two other men to 10- and 14-year prison terms
for Mafia association. Three people were acquitted.
   Montaldo was shot in his car on an isolated mountain road in
western Sicily in January 1983.
   He had collated a dossier on Mafia drug and money-laundering
operations that vanished after his death, state television said.
   Montaldo accused many politicians of working with criminals and
was known for his outspoken attacks on them.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The front-runner for next month's mayoral election
is a Democrat, his closest pursuer was a Democrat as recently as
December, and the No. 3 man in the race was Democratic county
chairman just 18 months ago.
   An out-of-towner might ask what these guys _ Richard M. Daley,
Alderman Tim Evans and former county chairman-turned Republican
Edward Vrdolyak _ are fighting about?
   But Chicagoans aren't surprised.
   ``When you have only one functioning party choosing one
candidate, the other guys get blocked, then frustrated, then go off
on their own and call themselves something else,'' explains Mike
Royko, a veteran political observer and columnist for the Chicago
Tribune.
   Evans, a black, ran as a Democrat when he was elected alderman
and is now running for mayor as an independent. Vrdolyak entered the
GOP primary at the last minute as a write-in candidate, and even
though he got 80 percent of the white vote in his unsuccessful
independent mayoral challenge in 1987, he is regarded as third in
the race now.
   The city's last Republican mayor was William Hale ``Big Bill''
Thompson, a three-term mayor so brazen about his alliance with
gangsters that his portrait hung in the headquarters of the Al
Capone gang.
   Thompson was eased out in 1931 by Anton ``Pushcart Tony'' Cermak,
credited with bringing to Chicago the modern political machine: a
coalition of ethnic voters bound by the principle of self-interest _
everybody gets something.
   What followed was a succession of politicians as diverse as
Daley's father, the late Richard J. Daley _ the last of the big-city
``bosses'' who died in 1976 _ and Harold Washington, a reformer
whose 1983 election as the city's first black mayor and whose death
just months into his second term in 1987 altered the course of
Chicago's Democratic Party.
   ``If the old man (Richard J. Daley) were alive, there's a lot
about the party he wouldn't recognize, even if his son winds up at
the top of it,'' said Eugene Kennedy, a Loyola University professor
and author of ``Himself,'' a biography of the elder Daley.
   ``In his day, a Democrat was a Democrat first and whatever else
he was came second.''
   Washington changed that by winning with little more than a single
racial bloc, Kennedy said. The town is about 40 percent white, 40
percent black and 20 percent Hispanic and other minorities.
   ``And what you see now, essentially, are three men _ two white
and one black _ relying on the same strategy, trying to do
essentially the same thing,'' he added.
   Washington's 1983 election came after a racially charged
campaign. But his ability to govern fairly eased the fears of many
whites who opposed him, and he was re-elected in 1987 with
significantly less strife.
   The younger Daley last week became the first white to oust an
incumbent black mayor in a major U.S. city by defeating Eugene
Sawyer, who filled in after Washington's death. But their primary
campaign was surprisely free of rancor and appeals to race,
considering the racially split voting.
   Daley, 46, three-term Cook County state's attorney, received
significant support from liberals and an emerging Hispanic bloc,
though the lion's share of his support came from many of the same
white ethnics who made his father mayor for 21 years.
   Black voter turnout was depressed, according to some estimates,
by as much as 20 percent in wards that had proved crucial to
Washington's victories.
   Most political observers laid the blame for that at the feet of
Evans, 45, who waged a long and often-bitter battle with Sawyer to
be recognized among blacks as Washington's righful heir. Sawyer was
elected acting mayor after Washington's death largely because of the
support of white aldermen.
   ``That split still exists, and that's the reason Daley likely
will win April 4,'' said Lu Palmer, an influential black political
activist and radio commentator. ``Many, many Sawyer supporters are
saying that Evans and his allies are the reason for Sawyer's loss,
and many are saying they will not vote for Evans.
   ``People are saying Vrdolyak will split the white vote with Daley
... but I say Vrdolyak won't have much of an impact. Why should
white Democrats cross over and vote for Vrdolyak? They've already
got their candidate.''
   Paul Kleppner, a political science professor and author, put it
this way: ``Almost everybody in the city may still think of
themselves as Democrats, but now, most of them are black Democrats
or white Democrats.''

   U.S. military officials questioned
an American soldier Sunday whose 11-day disappearance led to
speculation he had defected to communist East Germany.
   The officials refused to say what may have prompted the absence
of Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri, who they say had access to classified
information. They said he returned a portable computer that was
missing from the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment intelligence office
where he worked.
   Peri, 21, of Laguna Niguel, Calif., ``returned voluntarily to his
unit'' about 5 p.m. Saturday, according to Lt. Col. Dennis Gauci, a
spokesman for the U.S. European Command headquarters in Stuttgart.
   Gauci said Peri was in military police custody in Fulda, 65 miles
northeast of Frankfurt.
   Peri made no statement about where he had been, said Lt. Col.
Jake Dye, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's 5th Corps in Frankfurt.
``He (Peri) is being questioned. He has been given legal counsel,''
Dye said.
   Dye said Peri returned to his unit in civilian clothes and
appeared to be in good health. Peri disappeared Feb. 21 from the
11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Fulda.
   The disappearance baffled military officials, and speculation on
his absence ranged from possible foul play to defection to East
Germany.
   Some officials speculated he had defected after a military
vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near the town of Obersuhl,
at the East German border. Obersuhl is in a remote rural area 35
miles northeast of Fulda.
   U.S. officials said Peri had an excellent record as a soldier,
and they did not rule out foul play or illness as the reason for his
absence.
   Peri worked as an electronics warfare signal specialist. He was
responsible for operating equipment that detects enemy radar and
other signals. He has been stationed in West Germany since March
1988.
   Gauci said Peri's relatives in California had been notified of
his return.
   In March 1987, U.S. Army Pvt. Wade E. Roberts, 22, of Riverside,
Calif., defected with his West German girlfriend to the Soviet
Union. Roberts returned to the United States in November 1987 and
was court-martialed as a deserter.
   He was given a bad conduct discharge after being found guilty of
a lesser charge of being absent without leave.

   A suicide pact by four girls who took
rat poison so their parents could lavish everything on their brother
has shocked Koreans and raised questions about male chauvinism and
the plight of the poor.
   The girls, aged 6 to 13, were found unconscious Feb. 27 after
they took the poison. The youngest died immediately, but doctors
said the other three would recover.
   Yang Soon-mi, the eldest daughter, told police the girls made the
suicide pact because they wanted to save their parents money and
ensure their 3-year-old brother would have the best education
possible.
   The incident has shocked South Koreans, who have sent toys, dolls
and more than $15,000 worth of donations to the hospital where the
three surviving girls were taken.
   A social organization vowed to pay the girls' school expenses
through college, and Kim Ok-sook, the wife of President Roh Tae-woo,
sent a letter asking the girls ``not to lose hope.''
   Newspaper editorials blamed public policies they said do too
little for the poor in a nation of growing prosperity.
   Education in South Korea is free up until the end of the sixth
grade, and the oldest daughter was due to enter seventh grade.
Educating four daughters would have been a major expense, especially
since most Korean women have little hope of finding good jobs in the
male-dominated society.
   ``It's regrettable and shocking that the male-first idea was
planted deep inside the minds of such young girls,'' said Lee
Kye-kyung, publisher of the weekly Women's News, a leading advocate
of women's rights.
   ``We still live in a society dominated by men, despite our
economic success,'' she said, ``This is a typical case that gives us
a lesson. It may lead to a movement against prejudice and
restrictions on women's rights.''
   Opposition politician Kim Dae-jung visited the girls' parents at
the hospital and said, ``I am grief-stricken. I feel a great burden
as a politician, and I will focus on ways to promote the livelihood
of alienated people.''
   The girls' father, Yang Tae-bun, 44, is a factory worker who
supports the family on the equivalent of $362 a month. Police said
the family lived in a small two-room apartment.
   ``The deprivation of these children forced to resort to suicide
contrasts sharply with their affluent peers whose birthdays and
graduation from schoool are often celebrated at posh hotels by
expensive feasts, '' said an editorial in the Korea Herald.
   It said the incident ``has turned into a socially and politically
explosive issue.''
   Financial donations to the family included $700 from a grieving
father whose daughter was killed recently in a traffic accident and
$3.60 from a first-grader.
   The hospital said the family had dozens of hospital visitors,
including Cabinet ministers.
   The Korea Times said a composition written by the eldest
daughter, Soon-mi, ought to move citizens to reflect on the tragedy.
   Soon-mi wrote that when a neighbor visited to collect money for
the poor, ``I searched my pocket and found a 500 won coin (worth 74
cents). I was supposed to buy school things. But I put it into the
charity pot, hoping that the money would be used for helping the
needy.''

   A high school cheerleader was acquitted of
murdering her newborn boy by slashing his throat, after she
testified that he was not breathing and she tried to give him a
tracheotomy to help him breath.
   ``I'm just glad it's finally over and I can see all my friends
again,'' the 15-year-old from the Valders area said after her
acquittal Saturday on the most serious charge against her.
   A Manitowoc County Circuit Court jury deliberated more than four
hours before ruling the girl was innocent of the juvenile code
murder charge but guilty of trying to conceal the infant's body in a
plastic bag.
   When the verdict was announced, the defendant slumped onto her
attorney's shoulder and said ``thank you.''
   Judge Fred Hazelwood said the court must decide within 30 days
what action to take on the concealment conviction. The state
children's code, which keeps the girl's name officially
confidential, allows several options, including counseling and
community confinement.
   Until that decision, Hazelwood ordered her to remain in a foster
home, but he lifted an order that prevented her from having contact
with friends.
   The defendant, a sophomore at Valders High School and a member of
its cheerleading squad, said she found testifying at the six-day
trial difficult.
   ``I was nervous, but I actually got a chance to say for myself
what happened,'' she told reporters outside the courtroom.
   The girl testified she gave birth in a basement bathroom Dec. 28
but the infant was not breathing.
   After trying to revive him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
which she learned in a class on cardiopulmonary respiration, she
attempted a tracheotomy _an incision in the throat _ to open the
infant's windpipe but that also failed.
   She said she then placed the body in a plastic bag and dropped it
in the yard of a neighbor.
   District Attorney E. James Fitzgerald said in his closing
arguments that the physical evidence, including other cut and stab
marks on the infant's body, showed the girl really was trying to
kill the baby.
   ``Nice people do bad things; sometimes they do crimes,''
Fitzgerald said.
   But defense attorney Ron Kaminski said the prosecution managed to
prove only that the girl had a baby.
   ``Where is the evidence of death after life?'' he asked. ``As
horrible as it is, this is not a murder.''
   He conceded that ``everything she did was bad news'' but added
his client did not intend to kill the boy. He said prosecution
testimony had ``glaring ommissions'' and that the entire prosecution
was based on ``manipulation and speculation.''

   The state university that has played host
to a Communist convention, CIA protests and a building takeover by
angry minorities is facing student unrest from an unusual corner
these days: archconservatives.
   The right-wingers on the campus that they like to describe as
``so far left it's falling off'' have accused the University of
Massachusetts of violating their right of free assembly for
stripping them of the privilege of renting meeting rooms because of
a brawl with a left-wing group, which lost the same privilege.
   ``This is a leftist institution,'' said Republican Club President
Ted Maravelias, a 20-year-old sophomore, who said he will file suit
unless the 27,000-student school relents. ``This administration does
not want to hear the conservative viewpoint.''
   Club members brawled with members of the Spartacus Youth Club
Feb. 9 when the Republicans refused to leave a meeting of the
Marxist group. One person was injured.
   The scuffle was just the latest skirmish in the three-year
history of confrontations between political extremists at the campus
100 miles west of Boston. Among other incidents:
   _ The conservative student newspaper, The Minuteman, was the
subject of a meeting between students and administrators last month
because of disparaging comments about homosexuals. University
spokeswoman Stacey Chase said the school is investigating ways to
``distance ourselves'' from the paper, such as banning the use of
the university name on the banner.
   _ The Republican Club was ousted from its campus office in May
after a member pounded the wall separating the office from the
headquarters of the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay Alliance and broke a
tape player belonging to the homosexual group.
   _ Another campus group, the Distinguished Visitors Program, which
had shared space with the club before its ouster, complained of
frequent harassment and griped that a Republican Club member
answered its phones, ``Hello, Young Communist League.''
   _ Republican Club members yelled the words to ``God Bless
America!'' at demonstrators who tried to stop CIA recruiting at the
university in November 1986. Five months later, club members tossed
bars of soap at a small crowd that rallied in support of Amy Carter,
Abbie Hoffman and a dozen other activists on trial for charges
stemming from the demonstration.
   The Republican Club president contends that conservatives are a
persecuted minority on campus. ``Basically this is not even a
liberal campus. It's a socialist one,'' Maravelias said.
   The strong words of the small group of young conservatives have
aroused the ire of many on a campus that is notable for its turmoil.
   After the CIA protests of 1986, the university gained more
notoriety in November 1987 with a racial scuffle that injured 10
students and in February 1988 with a week-long building takeover by
minority students. A month later the school made headlines with the
election of a Communist as co-president of the student body.
   Jason Rabinowitz, a founding member of the Young Communist
League, has become a frequent target of The Minuteman.
   ``Certainly it's a progressive campus. For that reason, it is a
target for far-right groups,'' Rabinowitz said.
   The conservative group first emerged in early 1986 with The
Minuteman, started with a $740 contribution from the U.S. Industrial
Council's Educational Foundation, which also gave a boost to
conservative papers at Yale and Harvard universities.
   The Republican Club now claims about 200 members, although school
spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins said a cadre of a few leaders and a score
of followers runs the club and The Minuteman.
   More moderate student leaders say the campus is polarized between
political extremes, and few in the middle take part or even vote.
   ``To them, it's a sideshow. It's a calling-all-characters type of
deal,'' said John Dunlop, co-president of the school's Northeast
Area Government. He pointed out that only about 3,000 of the
school's 19,000 undergraduates voted in last year's election.

   Foreign ministers from 35 countries meet
Monday for East-West conventional arms control talks that may bring
sweeping reductions in troops and military hardware from the
Atlantic to the Urals.
   During a three-day conference at Vienna's former Hofburg imperial
palace, the ministers also will review prospects for a conference to
build confidence and security between East and West bloc nations of
Europe.
   The ministers were in Vienna in January to wrap up the Helsinki
follow-up Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
agreed on the new arms control talks and landmark human rights
provisions for the Soviet bloc.
   A new man on the scene this time is Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, who will meet Tuesday with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
A. Shevardnadze.
   They are to use their Vienna sojourn to hold bilateral talks both
sides hope will lay the groundwork for successful discussions in
coming months.
   Negotiations on reducing conventional troops and arms in Europe
will be conducted between the 16 NATO countries and seven members of
the Warsaw Pact.
   Talks on new confidence and security building measures involve
all 35 countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States,
Canada, and all European countries except self-isolated Albania. The
talks start Thursday.
   Western hopes are based on reduced East-West tensions and the
successful conclusion of Intermediate Nuclear Forces talks leading
to the destruction of the superpowers' intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   The Soviets and most of their allies also are showing a
willingness to reduce military spending in favor of more and better
consumer goods.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in December gave the new
talks a boost when he announced a unilateral reduction of half a
million Soviet troops in 1989-90, 50,000 of them in East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   Since then, all Warsaw Pact nations except Romania have announced
plans to trim their militaries.
   The arms talks will cover conventional armed forces and armaments
and equipment based on land.
   Naval forces and chemical and nuclear weapons will not be
negotiated.
   The Western alliance is seeking reductions of more than 50
percent from the Soviets and their allies to offset what it says is
the Soviet bloc's 2-1 superiority in tanks and artillery, a NATO
source said in Brussels this week.
   In return, NATO offers to cut its artillery, tanks and some other
mobile weapons by 5 percent to 10 percent in Europe, the source said.
   ``Since we are convinced that we ... (are) pretty much at the
minimum of our defense, this means for our military people a
significant sacrifice,'' the source told reporters at NATO
headquarters.
   In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov said on Friday
the Soviet Union wants to eliminate imbalances, especially in
offensive weapons, ``to restructure the armed forces of the Warsaw
Pact and NATO so as to give an absolutely defensive character to
troops and armaments during cutbacks.''
   He also said verification, a chief obstacle to the failed 15-year
talks on cutting troops and tanks in central Europe, could be
surmounted because of better monitoring abilities and more exchange
of information.
   Under new NATO proposals to be submitted in Vienna, there should
be no more than 40,000 main battle tanks _ 20,000 for each side.
   Artillery pieces should be kept to 33,000 and armored troop
carriers to 55,000 _ equally shared between the two sides.
   The other talks are a continuation of the 35-nation Stockholm
Conference, which in 1986 formally adopted the first East-West
security agreement of the decade, an accord designed to reduce the
risk of an accidental war in Europe.
   The NATO source said the Western alliance will propose an annual
exchange of information concerning military organization, manpower
and equipment involving all participants, improved observation and
improved access for accredited personnel dealing with military
matters and media.

<HEAD>Sees No Reason to Stop Drinking Unless Confirmed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   John Tower on Sunday reiterated his pledge to
stop drinking if confirmed as secretary of defense, but said he saw
no reason to do so otherwise and accused his detractors of
``hypocrisy.''
   Tower also drew a distinction between the past ``excessive''
drinking he has admitted to and an alcohol ``abuse'' problem that
would disqualify him for sensitive military positions.
   At any rate, Tower maintained that such judgments are made by a
military person's commanding officer and that, in his case,
President Bush is his commanding officer.
   Appearing on the CBS-TV interview program, Tower also restated
his determination not to ask that his nomination be withdrawn _
arguing that Bush did not want him to and that the controversy over
his selection has escalated beyond consideration of his own personal
qualifications.
   ``I still have sip of wine now and again,'' Tower responded when
asked whether he had stopped drinking since pledging a week ago to
do so if confirmed. ``Once confirmed, I will give it up altogether.''
   Asked why he did not stop drinking immediately as ``an act of
good faith,'' Tower responded:
   ``Well, why should I? Why should I? ... It is so little that it
doesn't really matter. One reason I can give it up, and give it up
easily, is because it doesn't really matter that much.''
   A few minutes earlier, Tower had been asked about arguments by
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn and others that he
would fail to qualify for a sensitive military position because of a
history of alcohol abuse.
   ``Does this not disqualify you?'' he was asked.
   ``No. ... I would be disqualified if you could prove alcohol
dependency or chronic alcoholism. ... In the final analysis, it is a
decision to be made by the commanding officer that should be based
on hard evidence. In my particular instance, the president of the
United States is the commanding officer.
   ``The fact is I am not alcohol-dependent,'' continued Tower.
``There is no conclusive proof to the effect. As a matter of fact,
the weight of proof seems to indicate otherwise.''
   ``You've admitted to alcohol abuse yourself,'' the questioner
persisted.
   ``I've admitted to excessive drinking in the 1970s,'' Tower
replied. ... ``I've said `excessive drinking,' not `alcohol abuse.'
... There's a difference.''
   Tower said he had no plans to withdraw his name from nomination
and would relish a chance to appear on the Senate floor to defend
himself, as suggested by the Senate Republican leader, Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas.
   ``I think it would be damaging to the president if he withdrew my
name or if I withdrew, because it would mean that the president had
finally been pressured into pulling down a nominee that he believes
to be eminently qualified,'' Tower said.
   The decision on allowing Tower to appear in the Senate rests with
the newly chosen Senate Majority Leader, George Mitchell, D-Maine.
Mitchell has said he opposed Tower's nomination, but has not ruled
on Dole's suggestion.
   Dole, appearing on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week With David
Brinkley,'' vowed ``to fight this to the end.''
   ``John Tower is the best suited man in America. President Bush
has said so,'' said Dole. ``And he has the right to make the
nomination because he won the election.''
   The Tower nomination has dominated politics in the nation's
capital since the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 11-9 against
Tower on Feb. 23, splitting on partisan lines, with Democrats in
favor and Republicans against.
   Controversy over the nomination threatens to undermine relations
between the White House and Congress at the outset of the Bush
administration.
   Democrats, led by Nunn, have said they were troubled by reports
of Tower's excessive drinking, extramarital affairs, and his ties to
defense and aerospace contractors.
   One Democrat, Sen. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, said on CNN-TV
that although many of the accusations against Tower had proved to be
untrue, he decided to vote against the nomination because ``it's
risky to have someone with his background and the problems he has
had in that office.''
   Tower said that the real issue was politics, not his personality.
   ``Senators are quite capable of changing their minds. I think
there is an imminent possibility that minds will be changed as this
situation plays out and as the arguments against me appear to be
more thin,'' said Tower, who served 24 years in the Senate,
including a 1981-84 stint as chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   Tower discounted the results of a poll released Sunday by the Los
Angeles Times, that 44 percent thought the Senate should reject
Tower, 35 percent though he should be confirmed, and 21 percent were
unsure.
   The survey, taken of 1,046 adults last Wednesday and Thursday,
was based on perceptions before Tower advocates began their
counterattack, the nominee argued. The poll had a margin of error of
4 percentage points.
   ``I think the debate is hurting the Senate ... (and) will cast
some doubt on the credibility of the Senate because of the inherent
hypocrisy involved in a lot of this,'' Tower said.
   In an effort to turn the tide, Tower vowed a week ago Sunday to
abstain from alcoholic beverages if confirmed by the Senate.
   Tower said he had told his second wife, from whom he is now
divorced, that he would stop drinking hard liquor.
   ``I did, for the most part, express my intent to her, and ...
since that time, I've been essentially a wine drinker, not a spirits
drinker, only occasionally drinking of spirits,'' Tower said,
drawing a distinction between distilled alcohol and wine and beer,
which have a lower alcoholic content per ounce.
   ``I had never pledged to give up drinking absolutely,'' said
Tower.
   Moreover, Tower drew a distinction between a promise to a spouse
and a public pledge.
   ``This pledge that I'm taking now, I regard as ... having the
same standing as my pledge to defend the Constitution of the United
States,'' he said. ``Now, if you say that everybody who has broken a
marriage vow or a promise to his wife can't be trusted to take this
oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, that he would
treat that lightly and break it, too, then that's going to narrow
considerably the number of people who are qualified to be in public
life.''

<UNK>State Inmate On Pass Accused of Slaying Ex-Wife</UNK>
<DATELINE>MISHAWAKA, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inmate on a day pass from a state
prison beat his ex-wife to death with a shotgun while her neighbors
watched, authorities said. She apparently was unaware that he was
being temporarily released.
   Alan Matheney, 38, was arrested about two hours after the beating
Saturday and charged with murdering his ex-wife, Lisa Marie Bianco,
29, said Cpl. Kevin Lockhart of the Mishawaka Police Department.
   Matheney, who wa serving time in prison for assaulting Bianco two
years ago, was being held Sunday at the St. Joseph County Jail in
South Bend.
   Prison officials said Matheney was released Saturday on his first
pass since being sentenced to an eight-year term in Nov. 1987 for
assaulting Bianco. The pass limited his travel to the Indianapolis
area, 40 miles southwest of the Correctional Industrial Complex in
Pendleton where he was being housed.
   Authorities said Matheney instead traveled 120 miles north to
Mishawaka, where police received reports Saturday afternoon of a
beating at his ex-wife's home.
   ``There were several witnesses,'' said Lockhart. ``It's kind of
the low-rent district, so nobody probably wanted to get involved.
... There's a lot of elderly people.''
   When officers arrived, they found Bianco lying in a yard. Police
said she was bludgeoned to death with the butt of a rifle.
   ``She was struck several times while standing and several times
when she fell,'' Lockhart said. The force of the beating broke the
shotgun in half.
   Matheney was seen leaving in a vehicle and was apprehended
unarmed about five or 10 miles away, Lockhart said.
   Charles Miller, superintendent of the prison complex where
Matheney was held, and Mishawaka Police Cpl. Rick Hurley said that
as far as they knew, Bianco was not notified her ex-husband would be
released for a day and that such notification was not required.
   It is required only when a crime victim or other citizen makes a
specific request to be notified before a inmate gets out of prison
for good, not just on a temporary pass, officials said.
   Matheney was eligible for up to a 48-hour pass. Correction
officials granted the shorter pass to gradually expose him to
freedom to ensure he could handle it, Miller said.
   He said he had no idea if there would be any policy changes
following the incident. ``Policy is something that's set by the
department (of correction), not individual institutions,'' he said.
   Police Cpl. Eugene Trippel said an autopsy on Bianco was planned.
He had no information Sunday on when she was married to Matheney or
whether the couple had children.

   Seventeen Palestinians were reported shot and
wounded in clashes with soldiers in the occupied territories Sunday
as Moslem fundamentalists declared a week of increased resistance to
mark an Islamic holiday.
   Palestinians erected barricades and burned tires in Gaza City,
shouting ``God is great! There is no God but one God!'' and pelting
Israeli troops with rocks, an Arab reporter said.
   Youths burned an Israeli flag and a three-foot wooden statue of
an Israeli soldier, the reporter said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Hospital officials said 12 Palestinians were shot and wounded in
stone-throwing clashes in Gaza City, Khan Yunis, Rafah and the
Jabaliya refugee camp, where the Palestinian rebellion began nearly
15 months ago. All are in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   The wounded included two boys from Khan Yunis, aged 12 and 13,
who were shot in the stomach, and a 12-year-old from Rafah hit in
the shoulder, the doctors said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   Arab reports said a 50-year-old Palestinian was wounded in the
leg in the West Bank city of Nablus and a 25-year-old from nearby
Askar refugee camp was shot in the hand.
   The army could not confirm the reports but said another
Palestinian was shot after he stabbed and lightly wounded an Israeli
soldier in the arm and that two other Arabs were shot and wounded in
a clash in Ramallah.
   In Nablus, the army maintained the 10th straight day of a curfew,
requiring the 120,000 residents to remain in their homes.
   Troops also raided homes and forced hundreds of people to sit in
the street while their homes were searched, an Arab reporter said,
adding that some area residents were ``hysterical.''
   The curfew followed the Feb. 24 death of an Israeli paratrooper
who was killed by a cement block dropped from a rooftop.
   At least 388 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed in the
Palestinian uprising against the 21-year Israeli rule of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The clashes came after the Moslem Hamas movement called for
strikes to mark Al Israa wal Meraj holiday, which was Sunday.
   The holiday celebrates the prophet Mohammed's journey to
Jerusalem, during which Moslems believe he ascended to heaven from
the site marked by the Dome of the Rock in the walled Old City.
   Hamas urged strikes Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, challenging the
pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of the Uprising, which called
for strikes Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The Hamas move, announced
in leaflets distributed Sunday, indicated a rift between the groups.
   While the Palestine Liberation Organization appears ready for
accept separate Arab and Jewish states to end the Middle East
conflict, Moslem fundamentalists have declared they want an Islamic
state made up of Israel and the occupied territories.
   Arab reports suggested Hamas also was upset that PLO chief Yasser
Arafat reportedly gave the Unites States information on radical
Palestinian groups in Europe. Some of these, such as Ahmed Jibril's
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, are
known to have links with Hamas, Palestinian reports said.
   In Jerusalem, a government official said PLO chief Yasser Arafat
has proposed talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and indicated
a willingness to have U.N. or multinational forces in the occupied
lands if they became an indpendent Palestinian state.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arafat
made the proposal in a meeting last month in Tunisia with Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, and that news of the meeting was part of ``routine
reports'' on the 3-month-old U.S. dialogue with the PLO.
   Several telephone calls to Owen's homes in Utah and Washington
were not answered.

<HEAD>Striking Eastern Pilots Foresee End Of 60-Year-Old Airline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tim McCord has logged more than 1
million miles in the air in 17 years as an Eastern Airlines
co-pilot, and now he's walking his first picket line, in sympathy
with striking mechanics and ramp service workers.
   ``At one time, Eastern was it. It had the best people and the
brightest future,'' McCord said Saturday night. ``I don't think I
have a future with Eastern anymore. I may have flown my last flight
as an Eastern pilot.''
   At the Air Line Pilots Association offices in the Miami suburb of
Coral Gables, pilots say their decision to back the 2-day-old
Machinists union strike could force the carrier into bankruptcy.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's owner, Texas Air Corp., has
predicted a widespread job action by the 3,500 union pilots would
drive the airline under.
   ``We called his bluff,'' said ALPA spokesman J.B. Stokes. ``He
thought he'd get enough pilots to keep a quarter of the flights.
Where are those pilots? They're on the picket lines.''
   Stokes said fewer than 1 percent of the APLA members _ 20 or 30
pilots _ decided to fly. He said replacing pilots may be near
impossible, since relatively few available pilots are licensed to
operate commercial jetliners, and ALPA last year won a court order
prohibiting Texas Air from training non-union crews for strike
contingencies.
   ``I don't want to sound elitist, but in time they can replace the
Machinists,'' said Stokes. ``It's a far more difficult task to find
people to fly the aircraft.''
   Stokes said he believes other airlines will quickly hire most of
ALPA members if they lose their jobs at Eastern. There is a
nationwide shortage of airline pilots, but some stay with Eastern
because they have built up seniority.
   The unusual alliance between ALPA and the 8,500 Machinists at
Eastern was prompted more by pilots' dissatisfaction with management
practices and promises than by unity with Machinists, who
traditionally have had strained relations with the pilots' union,
said Stokes. Pilots did not participate in Eastern strikes in 1958
and 1966.
   Stokes and other pilots say their grievances center on
management's pressures on flight crews since Texas Air acquired the
60-year-old airline in 1986. Allegations include allowing planes to
fly without making needed repairs or removing captains from flights
for deciding to ground a plane deemed unsafe, said Stokes.
   The ALPA walkout was assured when a last-minute contract offered
Friday by Lorenzo sought more than $64 million in wage concessions
from pilots and did not include a job-protection clause in the event
of bankruptcy, said Stokes, who claims ALPA members have already
given up nearly $500 million in salaries and benefits. Currently, an
Eastern 727 captain earns about $90,000 a year, nearly 30 percent
below the industry standard, he said.
   ``We had to figure out what was in the best interest of the
pilots,'' Stokes said. ``Trying to keep Eastern flying was not the
answer.''
   ``It breaks my heart to walk the picket lines and see what has
become of the airline I once loved,'' said flight engineer Bill
Hodgson, who has worked for the airline for 18 years. ``The second
definition of trust is assured hope. Do I have assured hope I will
fly again for Eastern? At this point I have to say no.''

   The U.S. government is taking its savings
bonds pitch on the fast track.
   The Treasury Department has agreed to pay $3,500 for advertising
on a white Chevrolet Beretta, which is expected to make its debut at
the Charlotte Motor Speedway on April 15, said James Gianfagna,
marketing director for the government bonds.
   ``I want to become the best salesman for U.S. savings bonds that
they have,'' said the man who will be behind the wheel, Aloysius
``Cappy'' Coleman Jr. of Jersey City. ``It's quite a unique
opportunity. I mean, who hears about bonds anymore?''
   Coleman, 44, owns Capgar Racing Inc., an automotive company in
Jersey City.
   He and his marketing director were searching for car sponsors
``and I said, `How about the government?' We laughed, but wrote a
letter to them. Then we heard back that they were interested.''
   The Treasury Department has not approved the car's exterior
graphics, but they might include an eagle and a picture of a U.S.
savings bond, Coleman said. Uniforms will be white, with red and
blue accents.
   Coleman still seeks a co-sponsor willing to spend $500,000 on his
automobile. And the government is just a little choosy about who it
wants to share the car with.
   ``We can't have alcoholic beverages or foreign companies.''

   Every night is opening night at the Spice
Room, a gourmet restaurant operated by University of Illinois
students.
   Customers dare not become too fond of the beef a la Saint Moritz
or the ricotta pie with chocolate and liqueur. They never will be
served again.
   ``We never repeat anything,'' said Jane Myers, who supervises 25
seniors in the restaurant management class. ``Each student takes
great pride in creating a unique menu.''
   The Spice Room, open to the public, serves on Tuesday and
Thursday evenings. A five-course meal, including wine, costs about
$10.
   Each night, a different student is in charge of selecting the
menu and supervising the other workers. That means selecting food,
buying it, timing preparation, and making a profit.
   A sample of every dish is prepared in advance to make sure the
recipe will work.
   ``What if my clam chowder curdles?'' said Eric Rose. ``I'd be in
trouble.''
   Customers fill out detailed evaluation cards, and Myers reviews
the comments with students at the end of the week. Everything is
graded, from the placement of silverware to the visual appeal of the
food on the plate.
   ``They'll say the waiter's shoes weren't polished or something
was cold,'' said Myers. ``But most people really like it.''

   The Hernandez family had not slept at
home for a week.
   They camped out in the hallway of their housing project, ducking
the bullets, as soldiers battled with snipers in the mud and brick
homes and rundown apartment complexes in the hills west of Caracas.
   ``I want my son back. I don't agree with what they've done,''
said Marina Hernandez inside her apartment Saturday, after a week of
nationwide unrest that left at least 246 people dead, by government
count. Thousands were reported detained.
   The army knocked on the family's door Friday, while Hermes, a
16-year-old high school student, was taking a shower.
   ``They dragged him away naked. We went to the military bases
looking for him. At Conejo Blanco (an army base outside Caracas),
they said he wasn't there and even if he was, they wouldn't let us
see him,'' said Mrs. Hernandez, the mother of three. ``All we can do
is wait.''
   Officials put the number of detentions at 1,000, but news reports
have said several thousand were taken into custody. Most of the
detained were taken to military installations, officials said.
   The rioting began Monday and was sparked by increases in bus
fares _ part of a government austerity plan. The violence began in
Caracas but spread quickly to other cities.
   On Tuesday, the government imposed martial law across the
country, giving the military the right to detain anyone on sight. It
eliminated rights to access to a lawyer or contact with family
members.
   Officials refused to say how long the martial law would go on.
   ``They're going to be in there for a good long while,'' said
Jesus Regalado, a member of an intelligence police unit, DISIP.
   Many arrests came from the winding streets of neighborhoods such
as the Hernandez's, where chickens and babies run through dirt
courtyards past graffiti-covered walls.
   ``Thank God my other brother, Miguel, wasn't here. They were just
taking anybody they could. They took away good boys from this
building,'' said Norma Hernandez, 22, sitting on a bed with her
mother.
   On the wall above them were bullet holes, proof of fierce gun
battles between army units posted on a hill above the complex and
snipers inside the building.
   Miguel and his father, Abdon, work as hospital janitors and were
not home when soldiers searched the building Friday, said Norma
Hernandez.
   She said fighting had quieted down since then, but sporadic
firing continued through Saturday.
   Officials cut off electricity to the building, but Mrs. Hernandez
said, ``we can't leave because if the military comes again and
nobody's home, they'll destroy our home.''
   ``We've been sleeping in the hall all week,'' she said.
   She said she didn't know who the snipers were.
   ``We can see the boys firing out the windows. But who knows where
they're getting their weapons?'' she said.
   Military spokesmen have said snipers were been using pistols and
Belgian FAL automatic rifles, which are also used by the army.
   ``I don't know how this is going to end,'' Norma Hernandez said.
   ``I think the government is going to send in an assault. There's
going to be a response, and it's going to end in a massacre. Because
when the army comes in, they don't have good intentions.''

   Carlos and Ileana Rodriguez spent the first day
of their honeymoon hanging around an airport terminal Sunday waiting
for their grounded Eastern Airlines flight to take off.
   The Rodriguezes, of Fairview, N.J., got married Saturday night
and had planned to take a 7:40 a.m. Eastern flight to Puerto Rico
from Newark Airport in New Jersey.
   But when they called the airline, they were told to show up for a
12:10 p.m. flight from LaGuardia Airport. Once at the airport, they
were told the flight was grounded because there were no pilots to
fly the planes.
   ``I'm very disappointed and disgusted by the whole ordeal,'' said
Rodriguez.
   Eastern flights nationwide all but came to a halt Saturday, when
8,500 machinists struck the carrier. With pilots joining the
walkout, only about 85 of more than 1,000 flights took off Saturday.
   Eastern expected to run about 125 flights nationwide Sunday.
   Outside the Eastern terminal at LaGuardia, several pilots who
were among the 40 pickets said no pilots had crossed the picket
lines.
   ``All flights canceled! All flights canceled!'' the strikers
shouted.
   But one Eastern flight made it into the air.
   Flight 19, bound for Miami and Bogota, Colombia, sat on the
runway for three hours with the passengers aboard before it left
about 1 p.m., according to Jim Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman in
Miami. Many passengers were to board a cruise liner in Miami, he
said.
   Wendy Margulis, of Newtown, Conn., whose daughter was aboard,
said a pilot told her the flight was delayed because the co-pilot
had walked off the plane. Ashlock said he did not know if that were
the case.
   Outside the terminal, a picket hoisted a sign reading, ``The
mechanics are out here, who's fixing the planes?''
   Other passengers said they came to the airport after Eastern
agents had told them by phone that their flights to Miami would
leave.
   Debbie Vasilevich of Poughkeepsie, who arrived at LaGuardia with
a Pan Am ticket, said: ``I'm so glad I'm not on Eastern.''
   But other would-be Eastern passengers were good-humored as they
jammed the Pan American World Airways counter.
   Salomeja Valukas, of New Haven, Conn., who was headed for Miami,
said she called Eastern on Saturday night and an agent informed her
the airline could not tell her anything.
   ``You have to go to the airport,'' she quoted the agent as
saying. ``What can I do? I went through the war in Europe. There are
worse things in life.''
   The number of passengers on the Pan Am shuttle to Boston and
Washington was double its normal weekend volume, said Pan Am
spokesman Jeffery Kriendler. He said the airline expects to use 64
shuttle planes Sunday with a capacity of 153 passengers each.
   By 11 a.m., Eastern agents stopped issuing tickets to travelers
who had booked in advance. The Eastern terminal at Kennedy
International Airport was a ghost town, with about a dozen pickets
trudging in the rain and a sign on the door that said:
   ``To our customers. We deeply regret the disruption in our flight
schedule. Our personnel will make every effort to assist you in
making alternative arrangements.''

<TEXT>
   ``The Pajama Game'' is the bright, wide-awake,
fourth entry in the New York City Opera's annual season of musical
comedies. The wonderful Richard Adler-Jerry Ross songs sound
glorious played by an orchestra bigger than will fit into any
Broadway pit.
   Not all the performers at the New York State Theater are as
endearing as those in the 1957 movie of the 1954 Broadway hit, but
they're good. The songs and Theodore Pappas' choreography, with
signature touches from Bob Fosse's original dances, carry the
ebullient day.
   Judy Kaye is charming as Babe, head of the grievance committee of
the Sleep Tite pajama factory. Her voice is rich and full. Miss
Kaye, who hasn't sung with the New York City Opera before, last was
heard here in the modern opera ``Desire under the Elms.'' A year ago
she was equally as effective in ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' for
which she won a supporting actress Tony.
   Richard Muenz sings the factory superintendent, Sid. He and Babe
run into differences over a proposed 7{-cent raise but also fall in
love. Muenz has sung on Broadway, in ``Chess'' and as Lancelot in
``Camelot,'' but he sounds operatically trained, much stiffer than
the way John Raitt sang Sid.
   Still, his ``Hey There'' and their duets of ``Small Talk'' and
``There Once Was a Man'' are winning.
   Lenora Nemetz as Gladys is the feisty dancer in the show's dance
plums _ ``Steam Heat'' and ``Hernando's Hideaway.'' Those numbers
made Carol Haney a star. Miss Nemetz's fresh, bright dancing pays
homage to her and to Fosse and brings enjoyment every minute.
   Avery Saltzman is in a similar state, as Hines, the time-study
man in love with flirty Gladys. Saltzman isn't intrinsically funny,
just walking across a stage, as Eddie Foy Jr. was. But he's funny
when the plot calls for it, as when he tries on sabotaged pajamas or
in his fervent duet about Gladys with a secretary (Brooks Almy),
``I'll Never Be Jealous Again.''
   Peter Howard, whose credits include seven Broadway shows,
conducted. The six dancing couples and the chorus of women singers
are fetching in their 1957 full skirts designed by Marjorie McCown.
Michael Anania created bright sets.
   Miss Kaye's husband, David Green, who has had featured roles on
``Kate and Allie'' and ``One Life To Live,'' plays Prez, the
factory's womanizer.
   The book, in which reedy-voiced Steve Pudenz plays an
unsympathetic boss named Hasler, was written by George Abbott and
Richard Bissell, whose family had a pajama factory in Dubuque, Iowa.
It's based on Bissell's novel, ``7{ Cents.''
   ``The Pajama Game'' will run at the New York State Theater
through April 16. The season is dedicated to Lawrence A. Wien, who
died in December. He and his wife gave the New York City Opera the
money to do five musical comedy seasons.

<HEAD>California Supreme Court To Take Up Insurance Revolt Proposition
103</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE GEISSINGER</BYLINE>

   The rate-cutting ax that voters dropped
on the auto insurance industry four months ago has produced a
confusion of government hearings and legal counterattacks by
insurers, but no relief for consumers.
   In fact, millions of Californians have seen their rates go up
while voter-approved rate rollbacks remain frozen by the state
Supreme Court pending review of legal challenges filed by insurers.
   This week, the state Supreme Court will begin considering whether
to unleash Proposition 103. The court is scheduled to hear arguments
Tuesday but has 90 days to rule.
   The measure, if upheld as constitutional, would lower property
and auto insurance rates by an immediate 20 percent below November
1987 rates in California. It would require an additional 20 percent
cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers next November.
   David Fountain, spokesman for the Association of California
Insurance Companies, said the industry believes that the court
``ultimately will find that Proposition 103 is unconstitutional and
that it will overturn the complete initiative.''
   If so, Fountain predicted, lawmakers would launch into a flurry
of proposals to establish ``reasonable rates and cost controls,''
with the guidance of the industry. ``We have learned that you cannot
ignore the voters.''
   Insurers' assessment of what will happen if the court upholds the
measure hasn't changed much since pre-election days, when they
predicted many companies would just pull out of the California
market, said Fountain.
   Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield said that if the measure
is upheld, the insurance market will remain calm if insurers
cooperate.
   If it is overturned, ``we'll be back on the ballot with `Son of
103,''' he said.
   ``We're glad the court is moving toward a decision,'' he said.
``It's extremely important to decide quickly because we have all
these insurance companies out there taking advantage of the stay by
increasing rates at unconscionable levels.''
   Drivers who expected their rates to go down following passage of
the measure have had an unwelcome surprise.
   For example, the largest auto insurer in the state, State Farm,
said it is raising rates an average 9.6 percent this year because of
underwriting losses not entirely offset by investment income. The
action has been challenged by the state.
   In other cases, drivers are just now paying, as their policies
come up for renewal, rate increases that went into effect last year.
About 70 of some 400 companies selling auto insurance in California
raised rates more than 10 percent in 1988, state officials say.
   California's insurance war erupted as rates skyrocketed,
particularly in the cities. Insurers in part blamed trial attorneys
for waging lengthy court battles in an attempt to win big
settlements. In turn, attorneys said insurers were just seeking
bigger profits.
   California's Legislature, torn by the powerful lobbies of the
insurers and lawyers, was virtually paralyzed.
   Rosenfield, a disciple of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, led a
citizen campaign that placed Proposition 103 on the November ballot.
   The insurance industry poured more than $60 million into the
battle against the measure. Though outgunned financially, the
Nader-backed measure won a slim victory, with 51 percent of the vote.
   Consumer advocates in other states hailed the passage of
Proposition 103 as an indication that the issue, already simmering
in many areas, could come to a boil elsewhere.
   Reacting to the lawsuits filed by the insurance industry, the
state Supreme Court suspended all provisions of Proposition 103,
pending its review. Later, it let all provisions but the rate
rollbacks go into effect while it considered the measure.
   Despite the court suspension of Proposition 103 provisions, there
has been no cease-fire in the insurance war.
   State Sen. Alan Robbins, chairman of the Senate insurance
committee, has accused several insurance companies of violating the
spirit of the proposition. He joined other lawmakers in introducing
bills designed to make insurers live under the spirit of Proposition
103 until all its provisions become effective.
   After the state Insurance Department challenged a plan to refer
new customers to a higher-priced subsidiary, State Farm, which
insures 2.8 million drivers in California, announced it would boost
its rates instead.
   The Insurance Department has set hearings this month for both
State Farm's earlier policy-switching plan and its subsequent
rate-hike proposal.
   The department has prohibited 11 companies with smaller customer
rosters from refusing to renew auto insurance policies after
Proposition 103 passed.
   Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie said the companies
violated provisions of Proposition 103 that restrict insurers'
authority to refuse to renew auto policies.

<TEXT>
   A coalition of two dozen consumer advocacy
groups, medical associations, insurance companies and trade
associations on Sunday outlined an ambitious agenda of safety and
health proposals extending to regulation of bunk beds and garage
door openers.
   The Coalition for Consumer Health and Safety said in a report on
its yearlong agenda project that injuries were the fourth leading
cause of death in 1987, behind heart disease, cancer and strokes,
and that when ``products broadly'' such as food, cigarettes and
alcohol are considered, ``then they also play a part in nearly all
of the 10 leading causes of death in the United States.''
   The Statistical Abstract of the United States says that accidents
in 1983 killed about 92,500 people out of slightly more than 2
million deaths.
   Insurance companies and their customers must pay many costs of
accidents _ the report said drug and alcohol abuse cost auto
insurers $12 billion a year, life insurers $4 billion and health
insurers $27 billion.
   The group made recommendations, many of them familiar, in seven
areas _ motor vehicles, home products, food, indoor air pollution,
cigarettes, alcohol and AIDS.
   Among them:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>AUTOS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The group called for all states to pass mandatory seat belt laws,
stronger auto side impact standards, rear-seat shoulder belts,
encouragement of full-width front-seat airbags and the extension of
federal auto safety standards to the increasingly popular vans and
utility vehicles which currently meet the less stringent truck
standards. It said anti-lock brakes should be required on trucks and
strongly considered for cars.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOME PRODUCTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   New powers were urged for the Consumer Product Safety Commission
and the Centers for Disease Control. In specifics, the coalition
called for putting amusement parks under jurisdiction of the
commission, which now may regulate only traveling carnivals; for
Congress to require development of a cigarette fire safety standard;
for development of child-resistant disposable cigarette lighters;
for a ban on the sale of fireworks and for extension of requirements
for smoke detectors and sprinkler systems.
   Garage door openers have killed 34 children since 1982, typically
by pinning the child to the ground when the child activates the
door-closing mechanism and tries to get out of the garage before the
door closes, the group said. It urged development of a standard
requiring an automatic reversing mechanism that would prevent such
accidents.
   Bunk beds killed 72 children between 1972 and 1987, often by
entrapment and strangulation, the coalition said in arguing for a
mandatory standard to replace the current, ill-observed voluntary
standard.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>INDOOR AIR</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The group called for more research on contaminants and ways to
deal with them, including product standards for devices such as
heaters and stoves that might contribute to the problem. It said the
Environmental Protection Agency should coordinate activities of all
government agencies.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>FOOD</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal and state governments should undertake ``extensive public
nutrition education campaigns'' to promote healthy diets and should
clarify and strengthen nutrition labeling requirements. Half of
what's in the supermarket carries no label information, and ``The
problem of incomplete and confusing labeling is compounded for
people on restrictive diets such as those suffering from diabetes,
hypertension and high cholesterol.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CIGARETTES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Governments should restrict smoking in public places, encourage
employers to develop non-smoking policies, enforce age restrictions
on cigarette purchase and increase education on the evils of
smoking, which causes 390,000 deaths a year.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ALCOHOL</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The group called for label warnings of the risks of drinking,
lists of ingredients and calorie content on labels, and, since
``alcohol advertising overwhelms public health efforts,'' more radio
and television commercials to spotlight the risks and a prohibition
on sports figures in pro-drinking ads.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>AIDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   As the number of AIDS cases grows, it will strain public
resources, and thus it is a consumer issue, the coalition argued. It
called for greatly increased educational efforts, particularly those
aimed at changing high-risk sexual practices.

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 Ukrainians on Sunday marked the
36th anniversary of dictator Josef Stalin's death by forming a group
to expose his crimes, but they saved much of their energy for what
they see as current repression.
   ``Our aim is to fight against modern Stalinism,'' Villan
Ochakievsky, a Ukrainian activist freed from imprisonment in a
mental hospital last summer, told the crowd.
   ``Stalinism Lives!'' shouted Volodimir Solopenko. He told the
crowd four activists were arrested in this Ukrainian capital 10 days
ago for organizing a legal demonstration. One of the four was beaten
in jail and sent to a hospital, where he has begun a hunger strike,
Solopenko alleged.
   More than 2,000 people heard speakers express similar sentiments
in Moscow in a rally organized by Memorial, the parent group of the
one founded Sunday in Kiev. The Moscow crowd, huddling under a
canopy in Gorky Park, applauded vigorously when literary critic Yuri
Koryakin linked Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev to Stalinism and
demanded his resignation.
   ``Democracy Yes! Stalinism No!'' one banner at the Moscow meeting
read. ``For a Society Without Executioners and Victims,'' read
another.
   More than 100 groups nationwide are campaigning for construction
of monuments to Stalin's victims, but they also take up a wide range
of issues.
   The 5,000 people gathered in front of Kiev's Republic Stadium
formed the new group. The meeting ended with adoption of resolutions
calling for a national day of mourning for the victims of Stalin and
opening of secret police archives.
   The group also demanded legalization of the Ukrainian Catholic
Church, rehabilitation and compensation of dissidents and the
release of Ukrainian human rights activist Anatoly Ilchenko from
imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital.
   Stalin, who ruled from 1924 until his death on March 5, 1953, has
been blamed for the arrests, killings, or other repression of 40
million Soviets.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev resumed a campaign begun by
Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev to clear the names of Stalin's victims
and acknowledge the extent of the dictator's crimes.
   Security agents did not interfere with the four-hour meeting.
   Kiev's prosecutor, Vladimir I. Shevchenko, made a reference at
the rally to a mass grave at Bykovnia, a village outside Kiev.
Activists say as many as 300,000 bodies were dumped in the mass
grave. Three government commissions had blamed the Nazis, who
occupied the village from 1941 to 1943, but villagers say the
killers were Stalin's secret police.
   Shevchenko said investigators had found evidence that people
buried at Bykovnia disappeared in 1937-38. But he said officials
still believe the site may also contain victims of the Nazis.
   Another speaker alleged that sand and bones from another
suspected mass grave of Stalin's victims, at Poltava in the Ukraine,
are being processed into concrete for apartment buildings.
   The deputy chief of the Kiev Communist Party, Stanislav
Martinyuk, won applause for joining the call to open government
archives. But the audience was less receptive when he said the party
was a victim of Stalin. Martinyuk said 94 of the 120 members of the
Ukrainian Central Committee of Stalin's time were ``repressed.''
   In answer to questions from the crowd, Shevchenko claimed to have
no power to free the four activists arrested 10 days ago, but
promised to investigate and protest if the charge _ hooliganism _
proves false.
   ``We have a Soviet society of laws,'' he said, using a favorite
phrase of reformers. When the prosecutor said Ukrainian officials
already abide by the law, some crowd members laughed.

   Four Austrian tourists were swept away by an
avalanche as they were skiing Sunday in northern Italy, and one of
them was killed, civil defense officials said.
   Two skiiers managed to free themselves from the snow and another
was rescued by Alpine guides who rushed to the scene in the Aosta
Valley in a helicopter, the officials said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA identified the dead man as Karl
Schmeikal, 50, of Salzburg, Austria. He was skiing with his wife
Hilde and two friends when the avalanche occurred near La Thuile, at
an altitude of about 6,000 feet, ANSA said.
   Mrs. Schmeikal and the two other members of the group trapped in
the avalanche were not injured, civil defense officials said.
   Italian authorities have warned that avalanches may occur because
of the warm, sunny weather that followed recent heavy snowfalls.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan said
Sunday that Moslems should have ignored ``The Satanic Verses,''
because controversy has brought the novel publicity, but she also
said the book should be banned.
   A radical Palestinian leader, Ahmed Jibril, vowed every effort to
kill Rushdie ``in defense of relgion, God, and his prophet.''
   Iranian media hinted a compromise was possible in Iran's
diplomatic standstill with Britain over the book, which some say
insults Islam.
   Ms. Bhutto, speaking on the British Broadcasting Corp. phone-in
show ``It's Your World,'' said, ``I do feel that the fundamentalists
have spread Rushdie's blasphemy.''
   ``Because what somebody writes (that) is not known, who cares
about that blasphemy? ... Perhaps it would have been more
appropriate to ignore such a book, to condemn it,'' she said.
   Ms. Bhutto came to power three months ago. She noted that the
previous Pakistani government had banned Rushdie's book but added,
``I don't think it has so much (to do) with Rushdie or the book, but
I think they just wanted a pretext to create a law and order
situation and to create anarchy.''
   However, she agreed that the book should be outlawed. Her country
is one of at least nine that have banned ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``I to think there are rare exceptions when the state has to
intervene ... balancing the freedom of expression and balancing the
security and the lives of the citizens,'' Ms. Bhutto said of the ban.
   Demonstrations against the book have killed 19 people in Pakistan
and India.
   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family in
India, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced him to death.
   In Damascus, Syria, Jibril said his Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command will make every effort to
carry out the death order.
   Although a staunch Marxist, Jibril said Rushdie's book was ``a
new conspiracy... a desperate attempt to defame God and his
prophet.''
   Jibril, a former Syrian army capital, leads about 1,000 fighters
based in Syria and Syrian-controlled provinces in neighboring
Lebanon. Jibril's statement was distributed to Syrian news offices.
   The Tehran Times, Iran's main English publication, suggested in
an editorial Sunday a ``change'' was possible in the deteriorating
relations between Britain and Iran.
   It referred to statements by British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, acknowledging
the ``The Satanic Verses'' was insulting to Moslems.
   ``It may still be possible for a change to occur in view of the
new attitude which the British leaders are beginning to adopt, even
though slowly and late,'' the newspaper said in an editorial
reported by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``Whether the changes in the air from the British side will be
enough to satisfy the Iranian government is yet to be seen,'' the
paper said.
   In its own commentary, however, IRNA said the statements from
Mrs. Thatcher and Howe are ``far from meeting the conditions set by
the Majlis (parliament).''
   ``The withdrawal of all copies of `The Satanic Verses' and
banning of its reprinting by the British government would certainly
bring London closer to implentation of the Iranian conditions,'' the
news service said.
   The Iranian Parliament voted Tuesday to break relations with
Britain unless Britain within a week reversed its decision to
withdraw diplomats from Iran. Britain has protested Khomeini's death
call and demanded it be rescinded.

<HEAD>Last-Minute Calls From Mormon Officials Doom Bill, But Reactions
Mixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The way state Sen. Kay Cornaby tells it,
the last-minute call from a Mormon Church official about a pending
liquor bill was no more than a mild suggestion that the measure
needed further study.
   But that and similar calls to other state senators at the hectic
finale of the 1989 Legislature last month apparently doomed the
bill, prompting accusations of illegal interference and forcing the
temperance-minded church to defend its right to speak out on what it
views as moral issues.
   The measure, which easily won House approval and was pending in
the Senate, would have formally legalized a decades-old practice of
allowing adult passengers in limousines and charter buses to drink
alcoholic beverages.
   ``The request that I got, was if it hit the Senate, to take a
close look and evaluate what effect it might have,'' said Cornaby.
   But Rusty Andersen, owner of Image Limousines, contends the calls
amounted to an unconstitutional mingling of church and state, and
illegal contact by unregistered lobbyists.
   He's threatened lawsuits on both issues.
   ``Senators are duly elected officials. They are of the people and
for the people,'' he said. ``This is a case of `of the church and
for the church.'''
   That view prompted the Utah chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union to defend Utah's predominant religion, saying its
representatives have a right to express opinions on legislative
matters.
   Cornaby and several other Republicans were called by Richard P.
Lindsay and Bill Evans of the church's public communications
department.
   Lindsay said Friday that church officials had recommended to
legislative leaders during a routine pre-session briefing that any
measure involving liquor undergo detailed study.
   The last-minute calls, he said, merely reiterated that position.
   In an editorial Wednesday, The Salt Lake Tribune labeled the
calls an inappropriate ``end run'' of the statutory process for
influencing legislation. The newspaper said the church already had a
registered lobbyist, Oscar McConkie, and that such contacts were
within his province.
   Lindsay denied the calls constituted lobbying and said McConkie
was ill and unavailable at the time.
   The Utah lobbyist law holds that anyone who receives
contributions or compensation for the ``purpose of attempting to
influence the passage or defeat of any legislation'' must register
with the state.
   But Associate Chief Deputy Attorney General David Thomas said
last week that Lindsay and Evans were ``technically within the law''
because neither received additional compensation beyond their normal
church salaries.
   It is by no means the first time officials of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, which strongly discourages use of
alcohol, tobacco, coffee or tea, have tendered opinions on liquor
legislation.
   Indeed, lawmakers frequently have sought the church's opinion on
proposed changes in Utah's strict drinking laws.
   This case involved a tradition in which limo and bus operators,
especially those running ``gambler specials'' to Wendover, Nev.,
have allowed patrons to take along beer or spirits.
   The practice was halted last summer when the Utah attorney
general's office decided it violated a law banning open containers
in motor vehicles.
   The measure to legalize the practice was approved by a 53-20
House vote after supporters argued that it would keep drunken
drivers off the road and that defeat would hurt tourism by
bolstering outsiders' beliefs that Utah is an inhospitable place.
   The bill had the support of the state Department of Public Safety
and Gov. Norm Bangerter, a Mormon.
   The measure was never debated because Senate President Arnold
Christensen, who also was called, would not recognize the sponsor,
Sen. Omar Bunnell.
   ``This is a bit of a tempest in a teapot, I think,'' said Bunnell
later. ``I just think the church could have done a better job of
it.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi bowed to
political and military pressure Sunday and said he is forming a new
government in hopes of ending the nearly 6-year-old civil war.
   Mahdi made the announcement after signing a ``national peace
declaration'' with other political leaders that endorses a tentative
peace agreement with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army of
John Garang.
   At a news conference, Mahdi also announced the fundamentalist
National Islamic Front had expressed a willingness to join the new
government. It had refused to sign the peace declaration.
   There was no immediate reaction from the rebels, who are mainly
Christian and animist and are demanding political and economic
reforms from the mainly Moslem government.
   The military had demanded Mahdi sign the cease-fire agreement.
The armed forces did not say what they would do if Mahdi did not
sign, but Mahdi had threatened to resign unless the army promised
not to overthrow him and union leaders pledged not to strike.
   The announcment came on the deadline Mahdi gave for his
resignation.
   Earlier, the Middle East News Agency in Cairo quoted Mahdi as
saying he would stay in office because the military and the
professional and trade unions had assured him of their support.
   He said his Cabinet ministers offered him their resignations and
that the new broad-based government would be announced ``in the
shortest time possible.''
   ``The new government will be formed with the aim of establishing
the largest amount of unity on the internal front,'' Mahdi said.
   He also promised a general election but did not say when it would
be held. The next scheduled election is in 1992.
   He said the new government would concentrate on the ``quick
support'' of the armed forces, which in recent months have lost
several towns to the rebels.
   Mahdi said the armed forces sent him a memo Sunday supporting the
constitution and the democratic process.
   He said ``ongoing contacts'' were under way to organize a meeting
``to resolve the peace issue.'' He did not elaborate.
   On Saturday night, Mahdi and 60 political and union leaders,
signed a program for the new government and the ``national peace
declaration.''
   Under the agreement, the new government must endorse a tentative
peace plan signed Nov. 16 between the rebels and the Democratic
Unionist Party, the second-largest party after Mahdi's Umma Party.
   The peace plan calls for an immediate cease-fire and end to the
state of emergency, and a conference with all political parties and
the rebels to negotiate a new government.
   Mahdi's failure to endorse it prompted the Democratic Unionists
to quit the coalition government in December. Mahdi then formed a
new government with the Islamic Front, which rejected peace talks
because the rebels are mainly Christian and animist.
   The rebels have fought since 1983 and won several victories in
recent months. Last month, they captured Torit, the second largest
garrison in the south.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat will visit
Pakistan for two days this week, the Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
His visit is expected to focus on Middle East peace and laying the
foundation for a Palestinian Embassy.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader is scheduled to
arrive Wednesday and leave Friday on his first official trip to an
Asian country since the declaration of a Palestinian state in
November.
   Pakistan, a Moslem nation of 107 million, is staunchly
anti-Israel and pro-PLO. Islamabad and several other Moslem and Arab
capitals immediately recognized the Palestinian state as the
previous Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
   Arafat will meet with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, but most of
his itinerary will not be announced in advance for security reasons,
a foreign office spokesman told reporters.
   Arafat is expected to lay the foundation stone of a new
Palestinian Embassy in Islamabad and possibly discuss recognition of
a newly formed interim government of Afghanistan headed by Moslem
guerrillas.

<HEAD>China and Iran Trade Warm Words, Promise Closer Ties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   China pledged Sunday to help Iran recover
from its 8-year-old war with Iraq and both nations said they would
establish closer ties, Iran's state-run news agencies said.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran met with Deputy Premier Tian Jiyun
of China and agreed to increase cooperation, Tehran radio said.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that Khamenei told the
Chinese leader ``The fields of cooperation between our two countries
are more than those currently identified, and other fields where we
can cooperate must be studied more seriously.''
   China was one of Iran's major arms-suppliers during the Persian
Gulf war with Iraq, when Tehran was virtually isolated by the West
and faced an arms embargo that forced it to look elsewhere for
crucially needed weaponry.
   Tian was reported as saying: ``We sympathize with the loss of
life and property during the war. We will use all our efforts to
help you in reconstruction.''
   Analysts estimate that Iran's reconstruction programs would cost
$300 billion to $500 billion.
   Western companies have been trying to move into the Iranian
market. But with Iran receding anew into diplomatic isolation after
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's call for killing British writer Salman
Rushdie, countries such as China can presumably have a larger chunk
of Iranian reconstruction projects.
   Khamenei said: ``In our cooperation with other countries, we
prefer to deal with countries for which our nation does not harbor
bitter memories.''
   He said: ``Our reconstruction will not be limited to those
destroyed by the war. We will embark on all programs which where
ignored by the previous regime.''
   Earlier Sunday, Tian met with Iranian Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, also monitored in Nicosia, quoted Musavi as saying
the good Iran-China relations during the Gulf war, would
``certainly'' have a positive influence on the expansion of mutual
cooperation.
   The Chinese official, heading a high-ranking political-economic
delegation according to IRNA, arrived in Tehran Friday, marking the
latest of a string of high-level visits to each other's countries by
Chinese and Iranian officials in recent months.
   The Iranian agency said Tian expressed his country's willingness
to boost relations with Islamic Iran and disclosed that China has
become Iran's sixth foreign trade partner while it ranked 40th a
decade ago.
   Since the cease-fire between Iran and Iraq, China and the Iran
have signed agreements for construction of a dam and two major power
plants in Iran and on sharing communications technology.
   Earlier this month, Iran became the first third world country to
open a consulate in the Chinese port of Shanghai.
   Defense experts say China has sold Iran more than $1 billion in
weapons, including Chinese-made J-6 and F-7 jet fighters, anti-ship
missiles and spare parts.
   Both sides have denied the arms sales.

<HEAD>Navy Moves To Block Ships From Militia-run Ports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RIMA SALAMEH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military chief and head of the
Christian Cabinet moved to reduce the power of private armies Sunday
by ordering a ban on foreign ships in ports run by militias.
   Gen. Michel Aoun, the commander of Lebanon's fragmented army,
said the order is an attempt to restore government authority eroded
by 14 years of civil war, said an official statement. The ban takes
effect Monday, it said.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, leader of the rival Moslem
Cabinet, warned Aoun's move could trigger new tensions ``because of
unilateral decisions taken without prior coordination.''
   But Hoss did not say whether his Cabinet would seek to counter
the general's order.
   Aoun reactivated a maritime office, paralyzed since the civil war
broke out in 1975, to supervise Lebanon's 160-mile-long
Mediterranean coastline and ordered the navy of four patrol boats to
help enforce the ban.
   Moslem and Christian militias have been running their own ports
to get arms and supplies, as well as all other imported goods, for
areas under their control.
   That has robbed the state treasury of an estimated $100 million a
year in customs levies.
   The new order follows Aoun's February crackdown on the right-wing
Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia and his government's
chief rival in the Christian heartland north and northeast of Beirut.
   Police said 82 people were killed and at least 200 wounded in a
three-day confrontation between Aoun's 20,000 predominantly
Christian troops and the 6,000-strong militia led by Samir Geagea.
   Aoun has driven the Lebanese Forces out of the so-called Fifth
Basin of Beirut's port, which the militia operated, and has taken
over inland customs posts, depriving the militia of income worth
$400,000 a day.
   He also ordered no taxes be paid to the Lebanese Forces in areas
under army control, stripping the militia of another 30 percent of
its revenue.
   Aoun's Sunday announcement is aimed at closing down illegal ports
run by other Christian and Moslem militias.
   The general's forces may be able to enforce the shipping ban in
militia ports in the Christian sector, but he probably will have
more difficulty doing so in ports held by Moslem militias south of
Beirut, where his writ does not run.
   His success against the Lebanese Forces has done much to restore
government authority in the Christian sector. Aoun has urged his
Moslem rivals to reassert state authority in territory they control
and take similar action against Moslem militias.
   Lebanon has had rival Moslem and Christian governments since
Sept. 22, when outgoing President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun to
head an interim military Cabinet until Parliament elected a new
president.
   Moslems refused to accept Aoun's appointment. They pledged
loyalty to Hoss, who served as prime minister in the Gemayel
administration.

   Severe thunderstorms spread large hail, heavy rain and damaging
wind across parts of the South on Sunday, and a cascade of frigid
air dropped temperatures to record lows from the northern Plains
into Texas.
   Scottsbluff, Neb., hit its second coldest day on record for any
time of year at 21 degrees below zero, 13 degrees below the former
record for March 5. The day's official low for the Lower 48 states
was 24 below zero at Chadron, Neb., the National Weather Service
said.
   An area of low pressure over east-central Mississippi and warm,
moist, unstable air produced an area of intense thunderstorms over
sections of Mississippi and Tennessee.
   Severe thunderstorms toppled trees in Covington County, Miss.,
near Guin, Ala., and at Wayside Community, Ala. Homes were damaged,
and trees and power lines were blown down by thunderstorm wind near
Phil Campbell, Ala., the weather service said.
   In Russellville, Ala., two children died in a house fire that was
set by lightning, but their father saved his wife and two other
children by hurling them through a second-story window.
   Hail as big as golf balls fell from severe thunderstorms in
Mississippi at Morgantown, Goss, west of Magee, near Stringer and in
Covington County, and north of Birmingham, Ala., the weather service
said.
   During the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, 2.04 inches of rain fell
at Columbus, Miss.; 1.71 inches fell at London, Ky.; 1.54 inches
fell at Meridian, Miss., and 1.10 inches fell at Huntington, W.Va.
   An area of snow, freezing rain and sleet spread from
north-central Texas across Arkansas and southern Missouri, with 3 to
6 inches of snow over much of north-central Texas. Wichita Falls,
Texas, had 9 inches of snow and Nocona, Texas, got 11 inches and
strong northwesterly wind piled up snow drifts 2 to 3 feet deep, the
weather service said.
   Freezing rain and sleet blanketed much of central Arkansas and
eastern Oklahoma.
   Freezing rain also extended from east-central Indiana across
northern Ohio into western New York state.
   The low pressure system over Mississippi was expected to move
across sections of the Ohio Valley during the night and through
Monday, and winter storm watches were posted for southeastern
Missouri, west-central Illinois, southern and central Indiana,
western Kentucky, southern Ohio and sections of Pennsylvania.
   Lake effect snow fed by moisture from Lake Michigan fell over
southeastern Wisconsin, with up to 2 inches reported.
   Elsewhere, a cold front over the Pacific Northwest spread rain
across Oregon and Washington state, and a mixture of snow and
freezing rain fell over the Cascade range in Washington state. In
the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST, Eugene, Ore., got 1 inch of rain.
   Unseasonably cold weather spread over much of the Plains states,
with overnight temperatures expected to plunge to the 20s and 30s as
far south as south-central Texas. McAllen, in the southern tip of
Texas, had a high of 99 on Saturday but reached only about 58 Sunday.
   Other record lows for the date were 27 at Austin, Texas; 20 at
Dallas-Fort Worth; 5 below zero at Denver; 14 below at Huron, S.D.;
11 at Lubbock, Texas; 11 at Midland, Texas; 23 at Waco, Texas, and
16 at Wichita Falls, Texas. Grand Island, Neb., tied its record of 1
below zero.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 4
degrees at Lemmon, S.D., to 87 at Valdosta, Ga., and St. Petersburg,
Fla. Sunday's low in the Lower 48 states was 24 degrees below zero
at Chadron, Neb.
   For Monday, snow was forecast from western Missouri across
eastern sections of the upper Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and lower
Great Lakes to sections of northern New England, with freezing rain
or sleet over sections of the central Appalachians. Showers and
thunderstorms were forecast from the Tennessee Valley across
northern Florida, the southern and middle Atlantic coast to
southeastern New York state. Showers were forecast over the Pacific
Northwest and the northern half of California.
   Highs in the teens were predicted from northern Minnesota across
northern sections of the upper Great Lakes to northern New England;
in the 20s and 30s from the northern and central Plains across
Oklahoma and north-central Texas, southern Minnesota, the central
Mississippi Valley, northern sections of the southern Mississippi
Valley, the Ohio Valley, southern sections of the upper Great Lakes
and the lower Great Lakes to the Atlantic Coast from Maryland to
southern New England; in the 60s and 70s over much of California,
the southern Rockies, the northern Florida Peninsula, southeastern
Georgia and the Carolinas; and in the 80s over the desert Southwest
and the southern half of the Florida Peninsula.

<HEAD>Eastern Passengers Run Aground As Strike Sullies Peak Florida Season</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Travelers slept on their luggage in airport lobbies,
stood in lines of confusion, argued over transfers and cursed the
labor fiasco that left them stranded Sunday on the second day of the
Eastern Airlines strike.
   Would-be passengers learned firsthand the hassle of going places
during an airline strike, particularly in Eastern's hometown at the
height of the Caribbean cruise trade and South Florida's tourist
season.
   John Vannua of Long Island, N.Y., defined the issue, and none too
delicately, for passengers at Miami International Airport.
   ``I'm not flying this stinking airline again!'' he yelled as he
tore up his Eastern frequent-flier card. He and three friends had
been waiting three hours to have their tickets validated by Eastern
for flights on other carriers.
   Eastern apologized Sunday for inconveniences suffered by its
passengers.
   ``We are placing the emphasis on protecting the cruise
passengers, the Caribbean routes and the Northeast shuttle,'' said
company spokesman Robin Matell. ``The handling of passengers is
below what we would like.''
   He admitted the airline has not been able to find lodging for all
passengers.
   ``We've been able to put many in hotels, but it's Grand Prix
weekend and the hotels are totally booked,'' he said. This is the
height of South Florida's tourist season with the Honda Classic PGA
tournament in Broward County, the Florida Derby and baseball spring
training.
   Miami International Airport, referred to somewhat fondly as Mondo
Airport, raises chaos to an art form on a normal day. That was
compounded Sunday by the strike.
   Anxious passengers peppered frazzled Eastern employees in
Spanish, French, Haitian Creole and English.
   ``Nobody knows nothing,'' said 33-year-old Charlie Rink of
Philadelphia. ``There's nobody walking around talking to people to
explain things. They need a troubleshooter.''
   In San Juan, Puerto Rico, about 300 cruise ship passengers who
had booked Eastern flights to the mainland were stranded late
Saturday at Munoz Marin International Airport. Cruise ship tourists
frequently end their cruise in San Juan, where they return to the
United States by air.
   ``We managed to get all those passengers out, either on Eastern
flights or with other airlines. The last of them left for Miami on
an (Eastern) Airbus at 11 p.m.,'' said Eastern spokesman Arnaldo
Deleo, adding that Sunday the airline ``chartered four planes from
Continental for cruise ship passengers.''
   At Washington's National Airport, Karen Palmer, Eastern customer
service representative, tried to help passengers.
   ``Everything is crazy,'' she said. ``They're canceling (flights)
as we go along. Other airlines are working with us. We're going to
do the best we can with what we have. ... I need a cocktail.''
   For Larry Palmer, arriving in New York on an Eastern flight at
1:30 a.m. Saturday after his original flight was canceled, it meant
being stuck at Kennedy International Airport. ``After the strike is
over, I'll write a letter of complaint and bill them for my extra
expenses.''
   While many passengers were cranky, others were understanding.
   ``I'm a little disappointed, but they've been very helpful. I
think the people behind the desk are doing a great job,'' said Sue
Carroll, 59, of Santa Ana, Calif., who was headed to Tampa for a
relative's funeral.
   Ms. Carroll was rescheduled for a flight three hours later on
Continental, Eastern's sister carrier, also owned by Texas Air Corp.
   Most airlines are helping Eastern, except for TWA, Eastern
spokesman Jim Ashlock said Sunday.
   ``TWA is not helping at all; American takes passengers on
standby; Pan American takes passengers on standby; United has been
helping depending on availability, either booking them on or
standby; Delta has got the same pattern; USAir and Piedmont have the
same policy,'' Ashlock said. ``Continental is taking everything.''
   In a designated area of Miami International, 32-year-old
Machinist Ray Rehill handed out informational pamphlets and watched
passengers scurrying about.
   ``I feel sorry for these people,'' he said, but he added, ``Their
day of inconvenience is my whole life. I've got a child and wife to
support.''

   Charles S. Scott Sr., an attorney who helped
integrate public schools nationwide by bringing suit in the landmark
Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education case, died Friday. He was 67.
   In 1951, Scott, his brother, the late John J. Scott, and the late
Charles Bledsoe sued the Topeka Board of Education in federal
district court on behalf of Linda Brown, a black elementary school
student.
   The case was later appealed to the Supreme Court, which declared
on May 17, 1954, that racial segregation in public schools was
unconstitutional because, the court said, separate schools are
inherently unequal.
   Scott also filed suit to integrate South Park High School in
Merriam, Kan. And he and his brother pressed several public
accommodation suits that gained black residents of Topeka and other
cities in Kansas access to swimming pools, theaters and restaurants.
   The Scotts' law firm represented the Congress of Racial Equality
during the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
   Scott was born April 15, 1921, in Topeka. He recieved a law
degree from Washburn University in 1948.
   From 1972 to 1975, Scott served as general counsel for the Kansas
Commission on Civil Rights. He had been a hearing examiner for the
commission since 1975.
   Survivors include his wife, Louise Crawford; a son; and a
daughter. Services were set for Wednesday in Topeka.

<TEXT>
   The army called in reinforcements to
tighten security in the troubled province of Kosovo, where a state
of emergency has been in effect to quell ethnic tensions, Belgrade
newspapers reported Sunday.
   The newspapers quoted Maj. Gen. Andrija Silic, commander of the
provincial capital of Pristina military corps, as saying that some
military reservists in the area have been activated in the province.
   Emergency measures, including a ban on mass gatherings and an
increase of military and police strength, were introduced in Kosovo
on Feb. 27 to prevent clashes between the ethnic Albanian majority
and the Slav minority.
   The measures came after protests by ethnic Albanians against
planned constitutional changes they fear will limit the autonomy of
the region which administratively belongs to the republic of Serbia.
   Serbian leaders claim tighter control over Kosovo is necessary to
protect the Slavs in the region who allege constant persecution and
harassment by the Albanians majority.
   Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million population is ethnic
Albanian. The province in southern Yugoslavia borders Albania.
   ``Armed force units have been placed in an increased state of
combat readiness and part of military reservists have been
mobilized'' in the province, Silic was quoted as saying by state
media.
   ``The high state of our combat readiness ... is our great
contribution to the stabilization of the situation (in Kosovo) and
the best barrier against aggressive forces,'' Silic reportedly said.
   National television Saturday night showed several tanks and
armored vehicles on training exercises or on patrol in the province.
   About 20 leading ethnic Albanian company directors or party
officials, including Kosovo's former Communist party chief Azem
Vlasi, have been arrested in the province since Thursday in a
crackdown on ethnic Albanian dissent.
   Most of them allegedly belonged to an illegal group that
reportedly detailed plans to destabilize the province by strikes and
protests and then carry out an armed uprising in which the region
would secede from Yugoslavia in order to join Albania.
   Belgrade newspapers said Sunday that 250 ethnic Albanian shop
owners, who closed their stores last week to protest the planned
changes of the constitution, now face fines for violating working
hours regulations.

   Here are some developments Sunday in the 2-day-old Eastern
Airlines Machinists union strike:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FLIGHTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Nineteen flights had taken off by 2 p.m. EST. Eastern said it
expected to run 125 flights by the end of the day. Along the East
Coast, hundreds of anxious passengers spent hours in lines in
Eastern terminals, hoping to find seats on other airlines or get
refunds.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes called service so far ``a mess'' and
apologized to passengers.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PILOTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern pilots, who virtually shut down Eastern Airlines by
honoring picket lines of the striking Machinists union, risk their
careers and ``the very existence'' of the airline, Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell said. ``By continuing to stay out, the pilots are
committing economic suicide.'' Bakes urged pilots to return to work.
   Eastern said the pilots were on strike, but a spokesman for the
pilots union said there was no strike. ``We are honoring the picket
lines,'' said Skip Stokes.
   And the 41,000-member Air Line Pilots Association reiterated a
pledge to begin a slowdown Tuesday that could delay every flight in
the country.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>PICKETS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Machinists and supporters picketed Eastern terminals. No problems
were reported Sunday, but three pickets were arrested Saturday at
Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on charges of picketing
in unauthorized areas, officials said Sunday. They were released
after a brief court appearance.
   The Machinists' strike was joined by most Eastern flight
attendants and pilots.
   In Atlanta, the Rev. Jesse Jackson spoke at a rally for about
1,500 strikers and their supporters. He urged President Bush to
intervene and bring the two sides together.

<NOTE>NEGOTIATIONS:</NOTE>

   None are scheduled. The last talks were Friday; they failed to

   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporary
restraining order against three major rail lines that carry 320,000
commuters daily between New York City and New Jersey, Long Island

   Eight other commuter railroads nationwide and Amtrak had been
potential targets of sympathy actions. But the Machinists union said
it decided to appeal Patterson's order and would not set up picket
lines at railroads Monday.

   A snake-venom researcher bitten by a deadly
viper rested comfortably Sunday while doctors considered whether to
treat him with antivenins from Iran, England and the Soviet Union, a
hospital spokesman said.
   William E. Haast, 78, remained in serious but stable condition at
the University of Utah Health Sciences Center after being bitten on
the left hand Tuesday by a Pakistani pit viper, also known as a
saw-scaled viper, said hospital spokesman John Dwan.
   ``Mr. Haast is resting very comfortably, eating and chatting with
friends,'' Dwan said. ``He's just in danger, if you will.''
   Haast, director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories at the
university's Research Park, has been bitten 148 times by snakes and
is immune to the venom of dozens of reptiles. But he had no immunity
to the viper's bite and checked himself into the hospital Wednesday.
   The saw-scaled viper's venom attacks its victim's ability to
produce fibrinogen, an element of blood that regulates coagulation.
A lack of fibrinogen can cause uncontrolled bleeding.
   Dwan said the level of Haast's fibrinogen had been improving
slightly although it remained ``dangerously low'' Sunday.
   Doctors were replacing Haast's fibrinogen with transfusions and
it appeared his system had begun to produce it again, Dwan said.
   He said Haast's blood was being analyzed every four hours, and
that by late Saturday his fibrogen level was about one-third of
normal. On Wednesday, he said, ``for all intents and purposes (it
was) at zero.''
   Haast's plight prompted an effort by Stephen Studdernt, special
assistant to President Bush, to coordinate the acquisition of
antivenins from the three nations and expedite shipment to Utah.
   Dwan said antivenins from Iran and England had arrived, but he
did not know if the one from the Soviet Union had. The antivenin
from Iran was more specifically made to counteract venom from the
species of viper that bit Haast, he said.
   However, he said doctors were ``very leery about giving
medication to someone from a source about which we know very little
about.''
   Antivenins are made from horse serum and can cause negative side
effects such as lung and kidney problems, he said.
   ``We want to emphasize the fact that we're grateful to everyone
who went to such great lengths to get the antivenin,'' Dwan said.
``The decision on whether to use them or not will be based on Mr.
Haast's condition. Hopefully we won't have to use them.''
   Haast had been treated earlier with antivenins from California's
San Diego Zoo and from a lab in Los Angeles, but Dwan said Saturday
he had not been given antivenins for about 24 hours.
   He said doctors also had contacted scientists and physicans in
Europe, across the United States and Australia to discuss treatment.
   ``It's a special kind of snake, with a special kind of poison,
and the immunology is complicated,'' Dwan said. ``Our physicians
aren't just winging it on their own.''
   Studdert said the Iranian government apparently did not interfere
with the shipment of the antivenin despite the strained relations
between the two nations. Iranian leader Ayatolla Khomeini has often
called the United States the ``great Satan.''
   The Pakistani pit viper is one of 1,000 exotic, poisonous snakes
Haast keeps at the laboratory, where their venom is extracted for
sale to universities and health organizations for research and the
manufacture of antivenins.

   Operators of a rattlesnake rodeo, rattled by
criticism that they could be driving the Eastern diamondback to
extinction, returned their catch to the wild Sunday.
   Because the 150 snakes were freed at the end of the two-day
event, no rattlesnake meat was on sale at Opp's 30th Rattlesnake
Rodeo for the thousands of people who attended. The meat had been
one of the better drawing cards over the years.
   In previous years, most of the 150 to 300 snakes that were
rounded up were either killed for their meat or sold to researchers
or snake exhibitors.
   ``We've been getting criticism for years from environmentalists,
animal rights groups and others about the way we did some things,''
said Jerry Hartzog, head snake handler for the Opp Jaycees. ``They
say we could be putting the Eastern diamondback in danger of
extinction or something, so we've started working with them.''
   But the move brought criticism from residents who are upset at
the prospect of the snakes being turned loose in their southern
Alabama community, Hartzog said.
   ``I reckon some people think we're going to just dump all of them
in one place,'' he added. ``That's not the case at all. We're going
to release the snakes back into the wild as close to where each was
caught as possible.''
   Others, like veteran snake hunter J.P. Jones, think the snakes
should be killed because they are a danger to hunters and others.
   ``If they (environmentalists) could see a little child die from a
rattlesnake bite like happened down here once, they'd change their
tune, I think,'' said Jones, the 68-year-old founder of the
rattlesnake roundup.
   The snakes originally were caught to make the woods safer for
hunters, he said.
   Before this year, the rodeo has raised more than $21,000 for
charity.

<HEAD>50 Guerrillas, 8 Indians Killed</HEAD>

   Indian troops searching a northeastern
jungle for rebel hideouts killed 50 Tamil guerrillas, a senior
Indian diplomat said Sunday. The Indians lost eight men, including
an army colonel.
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
guerrillas were killed when the Indians raided sites near
Mullaitivu, 120 miles northeast of Colombo, the capital.
   ``Reports I have before me indicate at least 50 Tamil Tiger
rebels died in the assault'' the Indian diplomat said.
   He said the Indian offensive was launched to clear the jungles of
Tamil Tigers who have regularly made forays into nearby villages to
massacre unarmed Sinhalese civilians.
   ``The Indian operation, yet going on, does not involve the Sri
Lankan army. We are searching jungles for the guerrillas and will
continue until we flush them out'' the diplomat said.
   Tamil who make 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people allege
they are discriminated by the majority Sinhalese who form about 75
percent of the overall population of the island off India's southern
coast. Moderate Tamils want autonomy _ while the Tigers are fighting
for independence _ for predominantly Tamil areas of the north and
east.
   In another incident, a Sri Lankan military official in Colombo
said a mine blew up a jeep carrying Sri Lankan sailors Saturday,
killing five and injuring one in Trincomalee, 147 miles northeast of
Colombo.
   On Thursday, Ranjan Wijeratne, foreign affairs and deputy defense
minister told reporters in Colombo that plans were afoot to launch a
joint Indian-Sri Lankan military operation to flush out Tamil Tigers
hiding in caves in dense jungles in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   This was after marauding Tamil Tiger rebels were accused of
massacring 81 Sinhalese villagers in three attacks on poorly guarded
settlements in the northeast during February.
   The worst came February 27 when Tamil rebels shot and hacked to
death 38 Sinhalese, including nine children.
   But the Indian diplomat said the operation was being conducted
only by the Indians.
   India has an estimated 40,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce a
New Delhi-brokered peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil separarist
war.

   Congress needs to restore military aid to
the rebels battling Nicaragura's leftist government, a congressman
said Sunday following a visit with 15,000 Contra troops in Honduras.
   ``Congress should not only continue giving humanitarian aid (to
the Contras) who are fighting the communists, but should also
restore military funding,'' Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss., said in a
telephone interview from Washington.
   Montgomery led a six-member bipartisan House delegation that
spent two days on the Nicaraguran-Hondouran border last week meeting
with the Contras at their base camps.
   ``Congress has created a real problem by not approving more
military aid to the freedom figthers,'' Montgomery said.
   Congress voted in February 1988 to cut off military aid but
agreed to continue $27 million in humanitarian aid for food and
medicine until April.
   ``They are a fine fighting force, but it is a whole new ball game
for them now because of the lack of military aid,'' Montgomery said
of the Contras. ``They just don't have the means to keep fighting.
   ``The fight is at a standstill. They lack ammunition to keep
fighting. Something has got to be done,'' he said. ``Their spirits
are excellent, and their numbers haven't decreased. In fact, they
are gaining more troops.
   ``But in May when the food stops coming, who knows what will
happen.''
   Montgomery said the delegation discussed options, including
bringing the Contras to the United States, or joining the Honduran
government in forcing them back into Nicaragua to survive the best
way they can.
   He said the group agreed that the best option is to push for
continuing humanitarian aid and to ask Congress for new military aid.
   ``We created the Contras to overthrow the Communists in
Nicaragua, and I don't think we should walk away from that
commitment,'' Montgomery said.
   Joining Montgomery on the trip were Reps. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.; Floyd Harris, D-Ala.; Earl Hutto,
D-Fla., and Bob McEwen, R-Idaho.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein said Sunday that
Iraq is ready to repatriate all of its Iranian prisoners of war if
Tehran agrees to free the Iraqis it holds, Baghdad Radio reported.
   The state-run radio quoted Saddam as saying that the POW swap
could be carried out independently of the stalled talks over ending
the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   Baghdad Radio quoted Saddam as saying at a meeting with Hans
Coshler, president of the Vienna-based International Progress
Organization, a human rights group, that ``Iraq, for humanitarian
and legal reasons, is fully ready to start a total exchange of
prisoners with Iran.''
   A comprehensive POW exchange would be a major breakthrough that
could break the deadlock in implementing a U.N. resolution that is
the basis for the current cease-fire.
   Iran and Iraq have been bickering since the peace talks began
Aug. 25 over how to implement the cease-fire resolution, which calls
for each nation to withdraw to their pre-war borders, an exchange of
prisoners of war and forming a special panel to assess blame for the
war.
   The two sides have released a few hundred ailing and disabled
prisoners since the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20.
   But a full exchange has been held up because of the deadlock in
the peace talks.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has registered
50,812 prisoners held by Iran and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands.
But U.N. and other officials estimate the total number of POWs to be
about 100,000.
   Iran, which claims the Iraqis still occupy border areas, insists
that a troop withdrawals to the pre-war border should be the next
step in the peace process.
   But Iraq maintains that Iran must abandon its right to search
Iraq-bound ships in international waters of the gulf for war cargo.
Iran has not stopped any ships since the cease-fire took effect, but
reserves the right to do so.

<TEXT>
   The driver of a passenger train said Sunday that he
went through a red light before slamming into the rear of another
train and killing five people, a British Rail official said.
   But there was evidence that driver David Morgan tried to stop the
train long before the red signal, said Gordon Pettitt, general
manager of British Rail's Southern Region.
   Morgan was among 94 people injured Saturday afternoon when two
London-bound passenger trains traveling from southern England wound
up on the same stretch of northbound track and collided.
   Authorities said Morgan's train, traveling from Littlehampton,
struck the rear of a train traveling from Horsham near Purley
Station outside London.
   The Horsham train was crossing from a slow track onto the main
line when it was hit from behind by the other train, they said.
   Thirty-one victims remained hospitalized Sunday, 10 in serious
condition, Scotland Yard said.
   Pettitt said there is no evidence of sabotage and no defects have
been found in the signaling equipment near the location of the
collision.
   ``Human error is certainly a factor in our investigation, among
other things,'' he said.
   Pettitt said Morgan ``has told us that the signal at the end of
the platform at Purley Station was red, yet he went through it.''
   ``He has not been able to offer any explanation for that,''
Pettitt told a news conference.
   He added that Morgan was hospitalized and ``obviously injured and
in shock.
   ``The safety of our signaling system does obviously depend on
drivers stopping at red lights. It did not stop,'' Pettitt said.
``We have a system of multiple signaling where a driver gets an
indication of a red light three sections back.''
   ``We have quite a lot of evidence that a severe brake application
was made prior to the collision and long before the signal,''
Pettitt said.
   He said the braking system of the Littlehampton train was being
examined.
   British Rail's board has accepted responsibility for the
accident, Pettitt said, and ``any claims will be sympathetically
dealt with as soon as possible.''
   ``It is right that we should say this to people because I am
satisfied there has been nothing going on externally such as
sabotage which might be involved in this accident.''
   Crews worked through the night to repair the tracks and remove
six coaches that rolled down a 60-foot embankment after the crash.
Many came to rest in the yards of homes.
   Area residents attended an evening service at Christ Church, near
the crash scene, to remember the dead and to give thanks that so
many survived.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher promised a full investigation
into the crash, the second serious accident on British Rail in the
last three months.
   Thirty-five people were killed in December in a three-train
collision at Clapham in South London. That crash was blamed on
malfunctioning signaling equipment, but an inquiry is still going on.

   Eli D. Danko, the 18-year-old son of rock
musician Rick Danko, choked to death on his own vomit after a
college party, the Albany County coroner's office said Sunday.
   Danko's body was found in his dormitory room at the State
University of New York at Albany when a fellow student went to wake
him for classes Friday, said Barbara Cavanaugh, a secretary to the
coroner.
   Students said Danko, a freshman, had been at a campus party the
night before and was ``quite drunk'' when he left around 2 a.m.
Friday, Cavanaugh said. She said the results of laboratory tests on
Danko's level of intoxication had not come back yet.
   Rick Danko, who lives in Bearsville between Albany and New York
City, was a member of the rock group The Band and now tours as a
solo act.
   His son was born in Rhinebeck, across the Hudson River.
   Eli Danko is also survived his mother, Grace Seldner of San
Rafael, Calif., his stepmother, Elizabeth, and two stepbrothers and
a sister.

   Lightning sparked a house fire Sunday
that killed a 7-year-old boy and his teen-age sister, but their
father saved his wife and two younger children by hurling them out a
second-story window, authorities said.
   The lightning ``came down through a tree'' and tore through the
wood-frame home's tin roof around 5:50 a.m., said fire Lt. Jerry
Boyd.
   ``Several neighbors said it sounded like a dynamite explosion and
immediately they heard some people scream,'' Boyd said.
   The family was sleeping upstairs when the fire broke out, and the
blaze consumed the stairs, said Boyd.
   Elton King threw his 34-year-old wife, Ruby; 3-month-old
daughter, Kelli; and 4-year-old son, Nikki, out a window, the
lieutenant said.
   Firefighters who arrived a few minutes later found the home
engulfed in flames.
   They found the bodies of Elton Ray King Jr., 7, and Misty Dawn
Hatton King, 14, in their parents' bedroom, Boyd said. ``They just
didn't get out.''
   The father, who was burned, cut and bruised, and Mrs. King, who
also suffered cuts and bruises, were in satisfactory condition
Sunday at Humana Hospital in this northwest Alabama city, Boyd said.
Mrs. King was also being treated for a lung injury.
   Kelli and Nikki were treated at the hospital for cuts and
released to relatives.

   Police wielding truncheons clashed Sunday
with 500 stone-throwing teen-agers in Gdansk following a Mass in
which Solidarity leader Lech Walesa appealed for moderation, a
witness said.
   About 10 people were arrested in the 40-minute clash in Gdansk,
said a witness connected with St. Brygida's Church. The witness
described the events in a telephone interview and spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Before the protest, supporters of the radical Fighting Solidarity
splinter group handed out leaflets accusing Walesa of selling out
the banned Solidarity movement in his talks with the government,
according to the witness.
   Walesa responded by saying there was room in Poland for all
groups and defended his negotiating position at talks with
authorities, which enter their fifth week Monday.
   ``I have chosen maybe a naive alternative in order to achieve
reforms at the least price. There is no revolution in the direction
we are going. We are entering an evolutionary path. You have to join
Walesa on this path whether you like it or not,'' Walesa said.
   After he spoke, demonstrators marched toward a nearby railway
station chanting, ``Solidarity!'' and ``Down with Communists!'' the
witness said.
   People began throwing money at police saying, ``Don't beat your
brother for money.'' Police ordered the crowd to disperse, to no
avail. They then moved in to break up the demonstration, the witness
said.
   The crowd pelted the officers with stones, and police responded
by rushing protesters and beating them with truncheons, he said.
   The opposition and the government have been meeting since Feb. 6
to discuss reaching a broad concensus on economic and political
reforms. The talks, an outgrowth of Poland's crippled economy and a
rash of labor unrest, may lead to legalization of Solidarity, which
was outlawed after the 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   The talks enter their fifth week Monday with an intensive series
of negotiations planned to resolve the issue of opposition
participation in elections to parliament, which the communist party
would like to hold in June.
   Both sides already have agreed that the elections will not be
fully democratic, instead guaranteeing that a majority of the 460
parliament seats will be open only to candidates from the communist
party and its allies.
   Now they are debating the format for the remaining races which
will be open to Solidarity and other non-aligned candidates. It has
been agreed that anyone may run who has collected 3,000 nominating
signatures.
   Party Politburo member Janusz Reykowski told The Associated Press
on Sunday that the discussions on political reform have entered a
critical phase.
   ``We are now, I would say, in a certain turning point. In the
last few days we have had very intensive meetings,'' he said.
   ``We are in the middle,'' he said. ''I hope that in the second
half of this week we will have a much more clear picture of what
really can be achieved in this process.''
   In Lodz, central Poland, supporters of the banned Independent
Students' Association demonstrated to mark the anniversary of March
8, 1968, student riots, state television reported.
   The nationalist Confederation for an Independent Poland meanwhile
held a congress to elect new leaders in a church in southern Krakow
city, said spokesman Zygmunt Lenyk. Police kept the meeting under
surveillance, he said.
   Police broke up a previous attempt to hold the congress just
before the start of talks on Poland's future between the opposition
and the government.
   Lenyk said Leszek Moczulski, who founded the anti-communist group
in 1979, was elected chairman of a 12-member political council. The
small but vocal movement opposes dialogue with the authorities.

   Hungary and Poland told Secretary of State
James A. Baker III on Sunday that the West should play a bigger role
in encouraging reform in the Soviet bloc, U.S. officials said.
   Also Sunday, the Bush administration offered the PLO the prospect
of substantive talks but stressed displeasure with raids against
Israel.
   Clarification of the U.S. stance seemed designed to assuage the
PLO, which last week complained the United States is not involved in
serious negotiations on setting up a Middle East peace conference.
   Baker met the foreign ministers of the two Soviet bloc nations
after arriving in Vienna to launch new East-West arms negotiations
this week and hold his first talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi and Poland's Tadeusz
Olechowski told Baker in separate meetings Sunday about their recent
political and economic reforms, said U.S. officials speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   There was ``a very strong general sense of an invitation for
further involvement'' from the West, a U.S. official said.
   Neither side agreed on specifics, but topics included improved
U.S. trade terms and less restrictions on importing Western
technology for Hungary and restructuring of Poland's burgeoning
foreign debt, the officials said.
   Before meeting with Varkonyi and Olechowski, Baker spoke with
Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, who welcomed him at the Vienna
airport Sunday morning.
   On the Palestine Liberation Organization, a senior U.S. official
said there are no plans to end the talks that began in December
after a 13-year ban.
   The ``real dialogue'' depends on the Arabs and Israelis staking
out their positions first, the official said, speaking on condition
he not be identified.
   On Monday, Baker meets the foreign ministers of Spain, Greece and
France _ the countries that have taken the lead within the 12-nation
European Community to bring Arab-Israeli peace.
   During a trip to Europe three weeks ago, Baker was urged to seize
on what the three governments see as a moderation in PLO policy
toward Israel.
   Robert Pelletreau, the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, has had five
meetings with the PLO since December. Talks have been dominated by
U.S. criticism of raids by Palestinian guerrillas on Israeli
positions in southern Lebanon.
   The talks were launched after PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism and recognized Israel.
   On Friday, the State Department publicly questioned Arafat's
ability and willingness to control factions opposed to what it
termed the ``positive evolution'' in his attitude on Israel.
   Arafat and other PLO officials have defended the PLO's right to
attack Israeli positions in southern Lebanon, saying attacks on
military targets do not constitute terrorism.
   A Kuwaiti newspaper Saturday quoted the PLO's information
department chief, Yasser Abd-Rabboo, as saying the PLO told
Washington ``it was time to resume a serious and in-depth dialogue
to prepare for an international conference.''
   Baker's meeting with Shevardnadze on Tuesday is likely to produce
an agreement for Baker to visit Moscow in late April on his first
trip to the Soviet Union.
   The Bush administration is moving slowly on making a policy
toward the Soviet Union. It has not set a date to resume
negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear weapons. Talks were
suspended late last year and were supposed to resume in mid-February.
   East-West talks in Vienna this week involve two dialogues _
NATO-Warsaw Pact talks on reducing conventional arms and troops
across Europe, and a bigger, 35-nation forum to increase trust
between the blocs.
   The NATO alliance is pushing for sharp reductions to what it says
is a Warsaw Pact edge of nearly 2-to-1 in tanks and artillery.
   The three-day meeting that begins Monday involving the 35 foreign
ministers from the superpowers, Canada and European states will
concentrate on enhancing European security.
   Thursday's talks involving the 23 Warsaw Pact and NATO nations
will focus on reducing trooops and non-nuclear weapons from the
Atlantic to the Urals.

   Big Lake musher Martin Buser was first
in line and on his way to the Alaska Range on Sunday as the leaders
in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race sorted themselves out in the
early stages of the contest.
   Forty-nine mushers streaked out of Anchorage on Saturday on the
first leg of the 1,168-mile race from Anchorage to Nome.
   Buser, 30, reached the Skwentna checkpoint some 150 miles into
the race at 3:53 a.m. AST Sunday. He and his 20-dog team were out
and on his way to Finger Lake, 45 miles farther down the trail, at
7:44 a.m.
   Buser, who finished third last year and paced the leaders for
much of that race, was followed out by Jerry Austin of St. Michael
at 9:13 a.m. Austin dropped two dogs at the checkpoint, leaving with
16.
   Four-time champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers raced out of
Skwentna 21 minutes later.
   The leaders were followed by about a dozen other mushers,
including Iditarod winners Rick Mackey of Trapper Creek, Susan
Butcher of Manley and Libby Riddles of Nome.
   The race, inspired by a sled-dog relay of serum to Nome for a
diptheria outbreak in 1925, began in 1973. It has become the
nation's most famous sled-dog and commands a first prize this year
of $50,000 and total prize money of $250,000.
   Wind up to 46 mph that raked mushers in the first hours of the
race abated Sunday and it was clear and cold.
   But race volunteer Bob Nobmann said the leaders were taking
longer that normal to reach the first checkpoint. ``We think it was
slow going between the wind and the ice, tough going,'' he said.
   From Skwentna, Buser, Austin and the others headed to Finger
Lake, a wide spot in the trail with a population of two residents.
From Finger Lake, the trail climbs into the Alaska Range at Rainy
Pass, the highest spot on the race route at 3,400 feet.
   The 17th annual race began with Austin first out of the chute.
Before the contest is over, mushers will trek over the Alaska Range,
across desolate expanses and along a storm-raked coastline.
   Riddles, 1985 champion and the first woman to win the marathon
race, said she thought the cold and wind Saturday might have been
good for dog teams, cooling them off in the early stretches where

   Isabelle Adjani took best actress award at France's
14th annual Cesar film awards for her performance in ``Camille
Claudel'' and in a symbolic gesture read from ``The Satanic Verses''
in her acceptance speech.
   Jean-Paul Belmondo, who said in advance that he would refuse an
award, was acclaimed best actor at the Saturday night ceremonies for
his role in ``Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate'' (Itinerary of a Spoiled
Child).
   ``Camille Claudel,'' which received a total of five Cesars, was
voted best film of the year. It also won the categories of best
photography, decor and costumes.
   Ms. Adjani, who has received two other Cesars for best actress,
has shown a special attachment to her role as the sculptress Camille
Claudel, the tragic lover of sculptor Auguste Rodin. In accepting
the award, Adjani referred to her as ``an artist too quickly
excluded by others.''
   Ms. Adjani, of French and Algerian extraction, then read several
lines from ``The Satanic Verses'' of Salman Rushdie, who has been in
hiding since Iranian clerics issued death threats last month, saying
his book blasphemes Islam.
   ``You should know what I have suffered. ... In the artist's
condition there is something extreme,'' she read. ``Angels are easy
to calm. Human beings ... can doubt everything.''
   There was little overt reaction from the audience at the
recitation, and she accepted her award and left the stage.
   Belmondo, 55, who had never before been nominated for a Cesar but
has starred in numerous films including ``Au bout de souffle,''
(Breathless), has said the audience reaction to his work is reward
enough.
   Jean Jacques Annaud, whose ``L'Ours'' (The Bear) is the current
box office hit in France, was awarded a Cesar for best director.
   The West German film ``Baghdad Cafe'' directed by Percy Adlon was
voted best foreign film.

   Two airplanes collided Sunday over the
desert seven miles west of the airport here, killing all three
people on one plane and the pilot of the second aircraft, officials
said.
   The collision occurred around 12:30 p.m., according to Cpl. Bruce
McGregor of the Pinal County Sheriff's Department.
   Officials said the planes involved were a Cessna carrying three
people that was believed to be from California and a small, red
single-seater from Phoenix, which is about 40 miles to the north.
   The Cessna burst into flames after hitting the ground, and the
bodies were so badly burned it was impossible to determine the
victims' sex, McGregor said.
   The Casa Grande Municipal Airport was the site this weekend of
the 31st annual Cactus Fly-in, which features antique and
experimental aircraft, but it was not known if the collision
involved planes from the event.
   The Pima County medical examiner scheduled autopsies for Monday.

   Police fired on Tibetan protesters in Lhasa on
Sunday after an illegal Buddhist parade erupted into a riot,
witnesses said, and at least 11 were reported killed and more than
100 injured.
   Hundreds of Tibetans demanding freedom from Chinese rule smashed
windows, looted shops, restaurants and hotels and vandalized police
cars in the capital of the disputed region, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
   Xinhua said protesters began the shooting by firing on police.
Foreign travelers in Lhasa interviewed by telephone said they saw
Tibetans throwing stones and looting, but saw no Tibetans with
weapons.
   They said police used tear gas to try to break up the crowds
before opening fire.
   The violence came on the first anniversary of another
anti-Chinese demonstration in which 24 people were reported killed.
   It also came five days before the 30th anniversary of a failed
uprising against Chinese rule that led to the exile of Tibet's
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
   Xinhua, reporting from the Lhasa, said early Monday that one
policeman and 10 other people were killed in the riots. Among the
injured were 40 policemen and more than 60 rioters.
   It said ``separatists'' fired at policemen and ``the police were
forced to fire shots as no other means could stop the rioters.''
   The report said the disturbance began at noon when 13 Buddhist
monks and nuns began an illegal parade in the Barkhor marketplace
area of central Lhasa. It said they waved banners and shouted
``independence for Tibet.''
   They were joined by several hundred people who began throwing
stones at a police station in Barkhor, Xinhua said.
   About 3 p.m. (2 a.m. EST), about 600 rioters emerged on East
Beijing Street, smashing windows, robbing more than 20 restaurants,
hotels and shops.
   Xinhua said the rioters made four attacks on government and
Communist Party office buildings, smashed traffic control posts and
lights and damaged more than 20 police vehicles.
   A Canadian tourist, Roch Berphiaume, 33, of Quebec, said police
first used tear gas to try to disperse the crowds and fired into the
air before aiming their weapons at the crowds.
   Berphiaume said that before seeking safety he saw groups of
Tibetan women and young men singing. Others threw rocks, he said,
and ransacked Chinese-owned stores and restaurants. He did not see
Tibetans with guns.
   ``There was a lot of firing,'' he said. He said he saw security
forces ``running with machine guns and rifles.'' A stray bullet hit
his third floor hotel window, he said.
   Berphiaume said the firing stopped around 7 p.m., then resumed
about 30 minutes later when rioting broke out again for about an
hour.
   No more shooting could be heard Monday morning, he said. ``It's
pretty calm now.''
   There were no reports of foreigners injured in the clashes,
although one Swedish tourist, Ceijo Iskojaanta, said several
foreigners had had their cameras confiscated.
   Iskojaanta said he had seen a few demonstrators waving protest
banners, but the protest quickly broke down into stone-throwing. He
estimated the crowd at about 1,000 at its peak.
   A Japanese student, Yuichiro Tanaka, said he saw Tibetans
demonstrating in front of the government building across the street.
   Tanaka said he saw police beating Tibetan demonstrators.
   The riots were the worst since March 5, 1988, when Buddhist monks
sparked fighting at the end of a prayer festival that killed 24,
according to Western travelers.
   At least 14 people died in rioting in September and October 1987.
The most recent violent protest occurred Dec. 10, when Chinese
security forces killed at least one Buddhist monk and one child.
   Armed police have been patrolling the city in a show of force and
the annual prayer festival that touched off last year's disturbance
was canceled this year.
   Xinhua said there have been four illegal parades in Lhasa since
Feb. 13. On Feb. 22, several Buddhist nuns were detained by police
after staging a demonstration against Chinese rule.
   China claims Tibet has been an integral part of it for seven
centuries. Many Tibetans say the Communists usurped control when the
Red Army moved into Tibet in 1950, and call for independence under
their former god-king the Dalai Lama, who now lives in exile in
India.
   The pro-independence uprisings have been led by Buddhist monks
loyal to the Dalai Lama. Although China now claims to guarantee
religious freedom in the remote mountain region, devout Buddhists in
this former theocracy hold bitter memories of Communist China's past
efforts to suppress their religion and destroy their places of
worship.

<HEAD>Easter Seals Telethon Passes Goal With Over $37 Million in Contributions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television viewers pledged more than $37
million to the National Easter Seal Society during its 18th annual
weekend telethon, the head of the non-profit organization said
Sunday.
   John Garrison, president and chief executive officer of the
Easter Seal, said this year's contributions totaled $37,002,000,
surpassing last year's mark of $35,100,000, and a goal of $36
million.
   ``We found that the American public was very supportive. We had
an even stronger turnout than we expected,'' Garrison said.
   The 20-hour 18th National Easter Seal Telethon, which aired live
from 8:00 p.m. Saturday to 4:00 p.m. Sunday on local television
stations nationwide, was hosted for the ninth year by singer Pat
Boone, and co-hosted by Mary Frann of CBS's ``Newhart'' and Robb
Weller of ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   Entertainers featured on the show included singers Tammy Wynette,
Mickey Gilley, Pia Zadora and Ray Charles. Debbie Boone joined the
host, her father, for a medley of their hits.
   The star of the show was 10-year-old Joy Hall, from Baltimore,
who is the National Easter Seal child. She was born with cerebral
palsy. Hall has already appeared on ``The Today Show,'' and will
guest star on the NBC series ``Amen'' later this year.
   Four corporations, Century 21, Safeway, Enesco and Amway,
contributed some $8 million to the cause, and became a part of the
``Million Dollar Club,'' said Garrison.
   The event was held at the Aquarius Theater here and an estimated
60 million people were expected to tune in.

<HEAD>Roving Band Of Women Blamed For Crime Spree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A roving band of women that uses sad stories to
gain access to homes may be responsible for at least 180 robberies
in which elderly Montreal residents lost cash, jewelry and other
property, police say.
   Police have named the marauding thieves the ``sob-and-rob'' gang
because they use sob stories to get into homes they plan to rob.
   One woman and two teenage girls, carrying Danish and Swedish
passports, are being held in connection with the Montreal robberies.
   Lt. Det. Daniel Bissette was quoted by Canadian Press on Sunday
as saying detectives doubt the girls' claims they are juveniles.
   He was quoted by CP as saying this is first time this type of
ploy has been used in the Montreal area, although he has heard
similar cases reported in Toronto and Vancouver. Similar reports
come from some U.S. cities.
   Montreal police say at least 90 elderly people have been robbed
by the female con artists and another 90 reported thefts but refused
to file formal complaints, CP said.
   Police in the United States say families of nomadic thieves are
using political refugee status, language barriers and aliases to
avoid prosecution.
   Women, often accompanied by teenage girls, use a variety of
pretexts _ such as asking for a glass of water or use of a toilet or
telephone _ to gain entry into a home.
   Based in New York and Chicago, the gangs travel from city to city
to prey on elderly homeowners. Once inside, someone distracts the
homeowner while the others quietly steal any valuables in sight,
officials said, according to the news agency.
   Before moving on, police say, the thieves ship stolen cash,
jewelry, furs and oriental rugs to their home base by courier or
parcel post.
   George Sunderland, manager of criminal justice services for the
American Association of Retired Persons, says it often takes weeks
before victims realize items are missing, according to Canadian
Press.

   Police in Quezon City say they
arrested about 100 people on charges of violating a tough new
anti-smoking ordinance Sunday, the first day the law took effect.
   Under the new ordinance, smoking is banned in most public places,
including buses, restaurants, government offices, hospitals and
theaters in the city of about 1 million which is part of
metropolitan Manila.
   Violators who smoke in public places that are not designated
smoking zones face a $10 fine, 10 days in jail or both.
   City officials said they will put up signs along municipal
boundaries warning people they are entering ``a non-smoking city.''
   Drivers of passenger jeeps, the most common means of public
transport, urged riders to hide their cigarettes when they entered
Quezon City.

<TEXT>
   Four sons of U-Haul's 73-year-old founder
scuffled after a stockholders' meeting in the latest episode in a
bitter family struggle over control of the truck rental empire.
   ``I created a monster,'' a visibly shaken Leonard Shoen said
after the brawl by his sons Saturday at the Sands Regent
Hotel-Casino.
   Hotel guards quickly broke up the fight, witnesses said.
   Shoen has sought to regain control of U-Haul since being forced
into retirement in 1986.
   Two of the sons involved in the fight, Mike and Sam Shoen,
support their father. The other two, board Chairman Joe Shoen and
Mark Shoen, oppose him.
   Paul and James Shoen, who support their brother, Joe, and also
sit on U-Haul's board, were not involved in the fight.
   Sam Shoen, holding an ice pack to his cheek, said the fight
occurred after the stockholders' meeting adjourned.
   ``They ran it in the most high-handed possible fashion even
though they knew they had the votes they needed to win,'' he said.
``They were not willing to allow discussion on anything.''
   During the meeting, Joe, Paul and James Shoen and three
non-family members were re-elected to the six-member board.
   The board chairman and his supporters refused to comment on the
fight, but issued a news release pledging a back-to-basics approach
in U-Haul's five-year management plan.
   The plan calls for an all-new truck fleet, discontinuing
unprofitable operations, liquidating unused assets and an employee
profit-sharing plan.
   Leonard Shoen contends the company has been devalued under Joe
Shoen's leadership and no longer adheres to its founding principle
of customer satisfaction.
   He also accused his son of lending money from a trust fund to
several U-Haul employees to purchase stock in an effort to retain
control of the company.
   The elder Shoen set the stage for the struggle years ago when he
divided 95 percent of the company's stock among 12 children from
three marriages.
   U-Haul is now part of Amerco, whose headquarters is in Phoenix.
   After Saturday's meeting, Leonard Shoen said the only way to
defuse the situation is to sell the company.
   ``This will have to be solved and that's the only way to solve
it,'' he said.

   Here is a look at Eastern Airlines, whose Machinists were on
strike a second day Sunday after negotiators failed to settle a
17-month-old contract dispute.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Owner: The 60-year-old airline has been owned by Texas Air Corp.,
headed by Chairman Frank Lorenzo, since 1986.
   Headquarters: Miami.
   Employees: 31,200, including 8,500 members of the Machinists
union, which includes mechanics, bag handlers and other ground
workers; 3,500 pilots; and 5,900 flight attendants.
   Size of fleet: 250 jets.
   Cities served: 118, with its major markets in South Florida, the
Caribbean, the East Coast and Latin America.
   Number of flights: 1,040 daily.
   Passengers: 100,000 average daily.
   Main strike issues: Eastern, which claims it lost $1 billion in
the last decade and is losing more than $1 million a day, sought
$150 million in wage concessions. The Machinists wanted $50 million
in raises. Each side said last-minute offers brought the sides
somewhat closer.
   Where negotiations stand: Talks under National Mediation Board
supervision in Washington were suspended at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
President Bush refused to appoint an emergency panel that would have
delayed the strike 60 days. No new talks were scheduled.

<TEXT>
   The $18 billion merger agreement between Time
Inc. and Warner Communications Inc. will create the world's largest
media and entertainment empire, but film industry executives are
divided over its impact on independent filmmakers and the creative
end of the business.
   The deal announced Saturday would result in the world's largest
publishing, film and music conglomerate with estimated annual
revenue of $10 billion, the companies said.
   The deal has raised some concern about the prospective union of a
major movie studio, Warner Bros., with Time's Home Box Office cable
television subsidiary. HBO has often relied on independent studios
for its product.
   ``In the short term, as these corporations get larger and larger,
you wonder if there's going to be any room at all for independent
product,'' said Ira Deutschman, a board member of the Independent
Features Project West, which promotes the interests of smaller
filmmakers. ``But, longer term, they'll have to depend on the
independents to fuel these big machines they're building.''
   ``Warner's not suddenly going to make 60 movies a year just
because they have more money, and I'm sure HBO is going to keep
making deals just the way they always did,'' said Alan Ladd Jr.,
chairman of newly formed Pathe Entertainment Inc.
   The merger agreement is part of a series of consolidations under
way for several years in the media and entertainment fields, but
executives doubted it would force other studios to join the trend.
   ``Is this going to put pressure on us to grow? No. Larger is
sometimes better and sometimes not,'' said Michael Eisner, chairman
and chief executive officer of Walt Disney Co.
   The merger probably will not affect the number of studios able to
mount a film project and will thus have little impact on producers,
writers, actors and directors, said James Wiatt, president of the
International Creative Management talent agency.
   ``You won't lose a player in this. It just creates a remarkable
empire,'' he said.

   A federal judge Sunday barred sympathy strikes by New York-area
railroad workers and striking Eastern Airlines Machinists pledged
not to picket any rail lines, easing fears of Monday morning
commuting disruptions nationwide.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson issued a temporary
restraining order against three major rail lines that carry 320,000
commuters daily between New York City and New Jersey, Long Island
and northern suburbs.
   The threat of confrontations with rail workers and commuter
snarls evaporated when the International Association of Machinists
then said it would not picket any of the nation's 12 commuter
railroads or Amtrak.
   ``The IAM will not set up picket lines at any rail carrier's
property at this time,'' union vice president John Peterpaul said.
``We don't want any IAM member or members of other unions to violate
the court's order or put themselves in a position that could
jeopardize their jobs.''
   But Peterpaul he said the Machinists will file an emergency
appeal of the judge's order Monday.
   ``When the court upholds our position we are prepared to
establish appropriate picket lines,'' he said.
   Secondary boycotts on air and rail travel are legal under the
1926 National Railway Labor Act but injunctions may be sought on the
grounds the actions would widely disrupt public transportation
service.
   ``There should be no problems. We're not going to violate the
order,'' said Ed Yule, general chairman of the United Transportation
Union, which represents conductors and train workers on the Long
Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad in New York.
   The 41,000-member Air Line Pilots Association on Sunday
reiterated a pledge to begin a rule-book slowdown at 6 a.m. Tuesday
that could delay every flight in the country.
   ``We see major disruptions and major changes in the whole air
system as a result of the Eastern shutdown,'' association president
Henry Duffy said in Washington.
   The move by the Machinists came after officials in major cities
set up contingency plans to brace for possible secondary strikes.
   _In Boston, officials had readied 150 public and private buses in
case of a sympathy strike that would affect service to 35,000
suburban commuters.
   The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority asked commuters to
carpool, stagger work hours and rely on the buses only as a last
resort because they could not accommodate the full load.
   _Amtrak, which carries 33,000 passengers daily in the
Boston-Washington corridor and 28,000 elsewhere, said it would add
12 high-speed trains between Washington and New York daily if no
sympathy strikes occurred tohelp compensate for reduced service on
Eastern's Northeast shuttle.
   _In Philadelphia, a transport union official said members would
obey an injunction against a sympathy strike in the city. Local
police had been asked to enforce the order in case of pickets in
Philadelphia and its suburbs.
   _In Baltimore, a computerized telephone operator for MARC, the
communter rail between Baltimore and Washington, had warned callers
of delays because of possible secondary strikes.
   _Greyhound Lines Inc. said 200 additional buses were on stand-by
on the the Eastern seaboard. Greyhound said it was planning special
non-stop shuttle service between Boston and New York, New York and
Washington, and Philadelphia and Washington.
   The order signed by the federal judge in New York covers the
LIRR, Metro-North and New Jersey Transit. It lasts until a hearing
Wednesday.
   LIRR spokesman Al Cannizzaro said ``we expect our employees to
report to work so that we can provide normal service to our
passengers.''

<HEAD>New Sunday Edition Of New York Post Stretches For Brains And Brawn</HEAD>

   The New York Post fired the latest salvo in the
Big Apple's four-way newspaper war, trying to lure both the brainy
and the brawny in a new Sunday edition combining savvy with sports.
   The tabloid, which has a third-place circulation of about
600,000, pushed its eclectic new image with a front-page article on
George Steinbrenner by literary journalist Nora Ephron.
   If sophistication was not a draw, there was Dennis the Menace and
Uncle Art's Funland, in color. The cartoons formerly ran in black
and white on Saturdays.
   For those hooked on the weekday Post's fare of politics and
crime, the front page headlined an exclusive in three-inch letters:
``Koch `Hit Men' Booted,'' on the secret deportation of two
Colombians believed to have been sent to kill Mayor Edward I. Koch.
   And there were sports, sports and more sports.
   Post President Peter Kalikow pushed the button that started the
presses for the Sunday edition of the nation's oldest continuously
published daily at 7:55 p.m. Saturday.
   The Tuxedo-clad Kalikow uncorked a bottle of New York champagne
and poured glasses for cheering pressmen in ink-stained coveralls
and paper hats. Later, Kalikow led them into the area where 575,000
Sunday papers were bundled and packed off for delivery.
   Publisher Peter Price handed out free copies of the paper Sunday
to travelers arriving at La Guardia airport.
   A year ago, Kalikow, a developer, saved the 188-year-old
newspaper from extinction by buying it from media mogul Rupert
Murdoch for $37 million. Murdoch threatened to close the
money-losing paper if he couldn't find a buyer.
   The Post now competes seven days a week for readers and
advertisers with the Daily News, The New York Times and the New York
edition of Newsday, the Long Island daily.
   The Post is third in the city circulation race, trailing the News
(1,281,706) and the Times (1,038,829) and leading New York Newsday
(176,043 in the city, and 706,440 overall), according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
   Kalikow is trying to lure the more than 300,000 people who read
both the daily Post and The New York Times, but who may not want to
carry home the slicker Sunday version of his paper, said George
Lois, who created an advertising campaign for the Post.
   The Post, which like many newspapers expects to obtain most of
its advertising revenue from its Sunday edition, ``is fully booked
with ads for the next four weeks,'' said Kalikow.
   Kalikow said he expects to spend $22 million to $25 million on
the Sunday Post in the first year. He said it would be months before
he knows if the move has paid off.
   Many media analysts have said they are skeptical that the New
York market can support a fourth Sunday newspaper.

   The Earth's fragile ozone layer will continue to
deteriorate until the end of the century even if all
ozone-destroying chemicals are banned immediately, an American
expert said Sunday.
   Sherry Rowland, one of the scientists who discovered the dangers
of compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons, said it would take
centuries to repair the shield that filters the sun's cancer-causing
ultraviolet rays.
   ``Even if we had a total ban tomorrow, and there were no further
emissions, we would expect things to get worse until about the end
of the century, and then gradually recover over two centuries,''
said Rowland, professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University
of California at Irvine.
   Rowland's comments came during a 120-nation ozone conference that
began Sunday.
   Rowland told reporters many of the compounds already released in
the atmosphere have not reached the stratosphere, 15-25 miles above
the earth. At that altitude, they are broken apart and the liberated
chlorine atoms destroy the ozone.
   The compounds also trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute to
the greenhouse effect, which could cause major climatic changes,
scientists say.
   Some of the compounds can last as long as 100 years. They are
widely used in aerosols, refrigeration, air conditioning and
fast-food packaging.
   Chlorine levels in the atmosphere would not return to the levels
of the 1960s until the 22nd or 23rd century, Rowland said.
   Robert Watson of NASA agreed ``it will take many many decades,
possibly even several centuries'' to restore the ozone layer.
   Soviet delegate Vladimir Zhakarov said the timetable for
eliminating cholorofluorocarbons should ``not be on the basis of
emotions.''
   Zhakarov also said Soviet data indicated the ozone layer over
parts of Europe and the western Soviet Union had been depleted by up
to 25 percent in winter, but that it was partly due to natural
causes.
   ``This depletion occurs every 10 to 15 days,'' he said. ``It
moves from west to east. It coincides with the movement of cyclones
during this time.''
   President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, who opened the conference,
said all countries had an obligation to protect the atmosphere, but
that developing countries would need help from the industrial
nations.
   Moi urged all countries that have not yet signed the 1987
Montreal Protocol _ calling for the compound emissions to be halved
by the year 2000 _ to ``join us in the endeavor to protect our
planet.''
   Britain's environment secretary, Nicholas Ridley, told the
conference six more countries _ Austria, Hungary, the Malaysia, the
Philippines, Trinidad and Zambia _ agreed to join the 40 that have
signed it.
   Some countries have gone further, including the United States,
which plans to eliminate all chlorofluorocarbons and similar
compounds known as halons by 1999.
   The 12-member European Economic Community agreed to a similar
target last week, and Commissioner Ripa Di Meana told the conference
he hoped for a total European ban ``well before the end of the
century ...''
   William Reilly, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
said whether that target is possible ``remains to be seen'' and
depends largely on how soon alternatives can be developed.
   Archie Dunham, a vice president for the Du Pont chemical company,
said it hopes to begin selling chlorofluorocarbon alternatives by
the mid-1990s.
   ``There is no single compound that has the complete range of
properties offered by the (chlorofluorocarbon) it is targeted to
replace,'' Dunham said. ``All will represent a compromise, whether
it be in flammability, toxicity, energy efficiency, suitability for
existing equipment or performance in use.''
   Reilly said he brought with him a letter from President Bush to
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher saying ``the United States attaches
the highest priority to the international environment.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said countries which produce and use the compounds
``have a heavier responsibility than others'' to resolve the problem.
   The United States is the leading producer of the compounds,
followed by Western Europe and Japan.
   In Dhaka, Bangladesh, President Hussain Muhammad Ershad opened a
conference on the greenhouse effect, saying his country could suffer
most from global warming because most of the population lives in
flood-prone regions.
   R.M. Stewart, a Canadian scientist presenting the conference's
main report, said recent research showed higher temperatures
increase water vapor, which could lead to heavier rainfall.
