   Daisy Fuller Young, mother of Mayor Andrew Young,
died Friday night. She was 87.
   Mrs. Young died at Crawford Long Hospital, said hospital
spokeswoman Tisha Burland. A statement released by Young's office
said Mrs. Young died of natural causes. Funeral arrangements were
pending.
   A retired schoolteacher, Mrs. Young recently relocated to
Atlanta from New Orleans. She was active in an Atlanta senior
citizens organization and led a fund-raising drive for programs for
the elderly in the city.
   She was the wife of Dr. Andrew J. Young Sr., who died in 1980.
   Young, who leaves office Tuesday, said his mother had a mild
case of the flu and a fever Thursday and had complained of
indigestion Friday. A doctor checked on her twice Friday, Young
said, and said she seemed OK.
   Young said his mother ``just slowly, gradually stopped breathing
in a very peaceful and beautiful way.''
   ``In a Christian family such as ours, you give thanks for 87
good years with a wonderful mother,'' Young said in a voice choked
with emotion.
   Mrs. Young was a graduate of Straight College, which later
merged with New Orleans University to form Dillard University. She
was on the board of trustees at Dillard.
   Mrs. Young worked as a schoolteacher in New Orleans and later
became office manager of her husband's dental practice, which was
operated in the family home.
   In addition to Mayor Young, a former ambassador to the United
Nations, Mrs. Young is survived by another son, Dr. Walter Young,
eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Moleskin Pants Destroyed in Fire; Tradition, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWATONNA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a pair of yellow moleskin pants went
up in flames, so did a 25-year holiday tradition.
   Every Christmas, the trousers were hauled back and forth across
the southern Minnesota community between the homes of
brothers-in-law Larry Kunkel and Roy Collette. Every year, the
packaging was goofier.
   This year, an epitaph delivered with the ruined pants Saturday
told the story:
   ``Sorry Old Man, here lies the pants ... An attempt to cast the
pants in glass brought about the demise of the pants at last.''
   Back up to 1964, when this got started.
   Kunkel's mother gave him the pants, yellow moleskin, a strong,
cotton-twill fabric supposedly good for Minnesota winters. Kunkel
found out they stiffened up in the cold, so he gave them to
Collette. The pants weren't warm enough to suit Collette so he
handed them back to Kunkel.
   Back and forth the pants went each Christmas, until Collette
upped the ante: One year he encased them in concrete.
   That's when the wrapping began to get out of hand: a truck tire
filled with nine tons of concrete, a welded-up 600-pound safe, a
17-foot concrete-filled rocket, a crushed automobile, a 225-pound
steel ashtray, a four-ton Rubik's cube, a totaled station wagon
jammed with 170 steel generators.
   Along the way, news stories about the ``pesky pants'' attracted
attention from all over the U.S. and from as far away as Europe and
Australia.
   This year, it was Collette's turn to deliver the pants. His
inspiration: Encase them in 10,000 pounds of jagged glass that he
would deposit in Kunkel's front yard. ``It would have been a great
one, really messy,'' Kunkel said Thursday.
   Collette shipped the pants to a friend in Tennessee who manages
a glass manufacturing company. While molten glass was being poured
over the insulated container that held the pants, an oversized
chunk fractured, transforming the pants into a pile of ashes.
   So, the ashes were deposited into a brass urn that now graces
the mantel in Kunkel's home.
   ``It's over,'' he said. ``Too bad, but once they were destroyed,
that's it.''
   Collette isn't so sure.
   ``Listen, Larry's the most competitive person I know. I won't be
surprised if I get the ashes back _ in something _ next year.''

   Had the Alamo been built according to Charles
Allen's blueprints, Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie would have fired on
Mexican troops from ramparts of peanut butter cookies.
   Allen is one of seven chefs and bakers who are fashioning
sculptures out of Girl Scout cookies to promote the organization's
annual cookie sale.
   ``This is more of an architect's job than it is an artist's,''
said Allen as he pasted Girl Scout cookies, and a pinch of
chocolate and applied an apricot glaze to the cardboard frame of
his 4-foot-tall model of the historic Texas fort.
   Allen said he had one big problem assembling his entry: hungry
co-workers.
   Other planned cookie sculptures include a model of the winged
mythological winged horse Pegasus.
   ``It's a new twist to selling cookies,'' Meg Cadigan, a
spokeswoman for the Texas Girl Scout Council, said Thursday.

   Clark Superior Court Judge George A.
Jacobs is inviting children and adults to ``adopt'' their new
Christmas dolls at his court today.
   The sixth annual special session of Jacobs' court will present
adoption papers to owners of dolls, teddy bears or other stuffed
animals.
   Jacobs started the program in 1984. About 700 people, most of
them children toting new Cabbage Patch dolls, showed up at the
courtroom in southern Indiana. About 75 to 100 people have
participated in subsequent years.
   ``We started it just to give the kids a sense that the courts
are there to help them, not to hurt them,'' Jacobs said.
   Jacobs said he also hopes lessons taught at a young age will
carry over for the children.
   ``They say they will be loving parents and we hope that will
carry over when they do have children of their own,'' he said.

<HEAD>No Prosecution, Discipline in Rep. Gray Leak Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision to
close an internal investigation into a news leak about an FBI probe
of Rep. William H. Gray III's office got a sharp rebuke from Gray
and from Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., who says the leak investigation
should continue.
   Thornburgh wrote Biden, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman,
that investigators had been ``unable to identify with certainty the
original source'' of disclosures to CBS reporter Rita Braver about
Gray's office financial affairs and therefore will not prosecute or
fire anyone.
   The leak occurred at the end of May while Gray, D-Pa., was
seeking election in the House as majority whip, and it prompted
accusations from Democratic lawmakers that Thornburgh's aides were
the source of a political leak.
   Thornburgh said in Friday's letter to Biden, D-Del., that
investigators also told him ``the nature of the confirmations
alleged to have been forthcoming to Ms. Braver'' were ``uncertain.''
   He said he accepted the investigators' conclusion that ``it
would be futile and impossible to pursue a prosecution based on the
available evidence.''
   Therefore, he told Biden, the case would be closed without
prosecution and without firing any department employees.
   Gray said, ``The failure of this investigation raises the white
flag of surrender to those in the Department of Justice who use
false leaks to defame innocent citizens. The leaks in this case
were designed to harm me, but their real victim was the integrity
of our criminal justice system.''
   Biden, meanwhile, said Thornburgh was failing to pursue the
investigation as he had said he would when he testified last June 2
before the Judiciary Committee.
   During that hearing, Biden said in a statement, Thornburgh said
that if his department's criminal division did not turn up enough
evidence for criminal prosecution, the Office of Professional
Responsibility would ``complete the investigation and recommend
appropriate sanctions against those who can be identified.''
   In addition, Biden said that although Thornburgh wrote that he
was told the OPR concurred with the criminal division's decisions,
the Judiciary Committee staff had gotten a different story from OPR.
   ``Although OPR was consulted at various points during the
investigation, it has never seen the criminal division report or
any of its conclusions, and therefore could not have and has not
concurred in those conclusions,'' Biden said. ``Furthermore, it is
also the Judiciary Committee staff's understanding that the
criminal division did not conclude that disciplinary action was
unwarranted.''
   Biden concluded: ``The proper course ... is for OPR now to
determine if any disciplinary action is warranted.''
   Thornburgh's spokesman, David Runkel, said the attorney general
believes the findings do not justify further investigation by the
OPR, and he disputed Biden's contention that OPR had not concurred
in the criminal division's conclusions.
   ``I don't know whom Sen. Biden or his staff has been talking to,
but that statement is clearly at odds with what the attorney
general was told by the criminal division,'' Runkel said.
   OPR chief Michael E. Shaheen does not have a listed telephone
number and could not be reached for comment.
   About two weeks after Ms. Braver's broadcast that the FBI was
conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations regarding
personnel and expenditures in Gray's office, the Justice Department
stated that Gray was not a target of the investigation and was
cooperating with the probe.
   Gray, who was elected whip, said he had been told by FBI agents
from the Philadelphia office in a Memorial Day interview that they
were looking into the possibility that one of his employees held a
no-show job. Nothing more has been heard of that investigation.
   Thornburgh told Biden that 11 FBI agents devoted approximately
385 days to the investigation, interviewing members of the U.S.
attorney's office in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia division of the
FBI, FBI headquarters, the Criminal Division and the attorney
general's office.
   He said about 30 other persons also were interviewed, including
members of Congress, aides to Gray, confidential sources and
several reporters. Ms. Braver ``declined to be interviewed or
otherwise cooperate with this investigation,'' Thornburgh said.
   Ms. Braver could be not reached for comment. The CBS Washington
bureau said she was on vacation.

<HEAD>FCC Probing Claims that Companies Overcharge Satellite Dish Owners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
investigating claims that some companies are charging backyard
satellite dish owners as much as 20 times more than cable systems
for the same TV programs.
   The FCC said Friday it had ``disturbing evidence'' that cable
operators were receiving preferential treatment from satellite
carriers for the programs cable operators provide by coaxial cable
to their subscribers.
   ``Because this evidence raises serious concerns about the
competitive nature of this market and the impact on consumers,''
the commission said it would conduct an inquiry into the matter to
determine if remedies were needed to protect the nation's 2.5
million dish owners.
   ``This is a great victory,'' said Larry Helland, attorney for
the Valhalla, N.Y.-based American Home Satellite Association.
Helland said the new FCC inquiry finally would force satellite
companies to justify their rates to backyard dish owners.
   The FCC's decision for an inquiry grew out of an investigation
of possible discrimination by satellite companies against
distributors of TV network and so-called superstation programming.
Congress, in the 1988 Satellite Home Viewer Copyright Act, ordered
the FCC study, which the commission completed Friday just before
its Dec. 31 deadline.
   The commission said that, based upon the information it had
gathered from nine companies, the prices satellite carriers charged
distributors did vary, but the FCC could not determine that there
was ``unjust or unreasonable discrimination.''
   It added, ``We do not foreclose the possibility that cable
operators are exercising undue market power to the detriment of
earth station owners and distributors'' and that its new inquiry
would look into that issue and take remedial action, if necessary.
   The FCC cited comments from the dish owners association and the
National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, an organization of
550 rural electric cooperatives and small telephone systems in 47
states that distributes a package of TV programming known as
``Rural TV'' to 30,000 backyard dish owners.
   According to the telecommunications cooperative, Eastern
Microwave proposed to charge NRTC $1.34 per month per subscriber
for the signal of WWOR, New York, and WSBK, Boston. The cooperative
told the commission that Eastern charges cable systems 18 cents to
20 cents per month for WWOR and WSBK.
   Eastern Microwave, in a letter to the cooperative, said the 1988
satellite act applied only to discrimination among distributors to
earth station owners and that rates charged to ``other classes of
users are irrelevant,'' the commission said.
   The cooperative also told the commission that Southern Satellite
Systems charges NRTC 79 cents per subscriber per month for
superstation WTBS, Atlanta, while offering the same service to
cable systems for 4 cents to 10 cents per month per subscriber.
   The cooperative said Netlink charges $3.25 a month per
subscriber for five Denver network and superstation signals, while
Denver cable systems get Netlink's feed for 58 cents per subscriber
per month.
   ``Our inquiry suggests that cable operators are paying
substantially less than distributors to home earth stations for the
same programming,'' the FCC said. ``The limited evidence that is in
this record does not support a conclusion that the wide disparities
between distributor and cable operator rates have been justified.''
   Bob Phillips, chief executive officer of the National Rural
Telecommunications Cooperative, said he was ``anxiously awaiting a
further inquiry so we can establish the discrimination between the
home dish market and the cable market, and we can gain some
relief.''
   Backyard dish owners may pay from $3 to about $20 a month for TV
programs, and the average cost of the dish and descrambling
equipment is about $2,500.

<TEXT>
   The red meat in crude plastic packs
being carted into Bucharest's crowded, dimly lighted stores looks
unappetizing, but for people accustomed to a diet of pigs' feet, it
might as well be chateaubriand.
   ``This isn't new. I've stood in lines like this before,'' said
furniture worker Marim Ghedzu as he waited in a long queue for meat
this week. ``But there's almost never been anything like this in
Romania. I would stand here even if the pieces were small.''
   Under Nicolae Ceausescu, this meat went for export, much of it
to the meat-starved Soviet Union in exchange for the raw materials
needed to fuel the industries the dictator built to fulfill
self-aggrandizing dreams of transforming agricultural Romania into
a major industrial state.
   According to an economist writing in the daily newspaper
Adventarul this week, at least $12 billion was wasted on
investments in these projects.
   For the most part, this money was paid back through food exports
to the West, or the export of petrochemicals made with Romanian oil
and the raw materials from the Soviets, Iran and anywhere else
Ceausescu could buy oil and gas in exchange for food.
   Romania, once the breadbasket of southeastern Europe, became a
land of ration cards and bare shelves. Emigres recall going six
months without eating a piece of meat or even seeing butter.
   That has changed since the anti-Ceausescu revolt erupted Dec. 15
in the western city of Timisoara, where demonstrators massacred by
Ceausescu's security forces called for bread along with their
freedom.
   Before he was executed, Ceausescu put food on the shelves in a
last-ditch attempt to appease his unruly populace.
   It didn't work. But the new government swiftly took measures to
ensure the people who fought for freedom and ousted Ceausescu Dec.
22 felt some immediate relief from the burden of oppression and
privation.
   On Dec. 23, Romania's new rulers announced they were ending
rationing and food exports, and lifting draconian restrictions on
heating and lighting homes and offices.
   Corruption had always bent those and many other rules in Romania
under Ceausescu. But people nonetheless froze in homes and offices,
shivering in overcoats at their desks and donning gloves and hats
to sit and watch the opera before it and all other public
entertainments _ TV included _ shut down at 10 p.m.
   Marin Sorescu, one of Romania's best-known writers, proudly
showed off his beautiful 19th-century home in old Bucharest Friday.
``At least now I can bring you in here, because it is warm,'' he
beamed as snow swirled down outside.
   Citrus fruits, unseen in ages, have appeared on shop shelves.
Butter, previously rationed to as little as 7 ounces a month,
cheese, unappetizing-looking sausage, and even that previously
unpurchasable luxury _ coffee, are on sale.
   Western diplomats say the goods come from special warehouses
where they were stored either for export or for distribution to the
Communist elite.
   Corneliu Bogdan, first deputy foreign minister in the new
government, said Friday the leadership has tried to ease life
without disrupting the national economy.
   Ending ration cards, banning food exports and curbing oil
exports fell into that category, as did the popular decisions to
declare Jan. 2 an extra New Year's holiday and extend students'
vacation by 11 days to Jan. 14.
   More basic economic questions and overall strategy are not
expected to be resolved until a new government takes power
following free elections in April. For that task, Romanians hope to
avoid mistakes made in the earlier reforms of Poland, Hungary and
the Soviet Union.
   Silviu Brucan, a former foreign minister and member of the new
leadership, said last week Romania should learn from the Soviets
and feed its people before reforming industry.
   With Romania's fertile soil, that should be easier to achieve
than in the Soviet Union, where weather makes farming difficult and
60 years of state agriculture have killed off most peasant
traditions.
   Yet, it may take a while before stores measure up even to the
standards of 10 years ago.
   On Friday night, a vegetable store that for three years has had
virtually nothing to sell was offering potatoes, beets, leeks,
apples and dried fruit.
   Previously unseen lemons were being sold down the street.
   ``It's better, but it's not great,'' said Dina Cristescu, 22.
``We are still waiting. We are a country that waits always.''
   Slushing around in the damp dirt left by shoppers braving a
daylong snowstorm, about 20 men and women jostled in a queue for
the only other product on sale: crude and unappetizing salami.
   In between the vegetable and the salami shop, another crowd
waited for chocolate and sweets.
   Around the corner, at least 40 people bearing the fruits of a
day's shopping waited in the dark street and muddy slush for the
rare treasure of a taxi to get it all home.

<HEAD>Navy `Robbing Peter to Pay Paul' For 1991 Budget</HEAD>

   The Navy is ``seriously considering'' limiting
purchases of its prized $1.2 billion Trident submarine to every
other year in reaction to intense budget pressures for the new
fiscal year, a senior Pentagon official says.
   The service also is proposing to put two of its four battleships
in mothballs as it fights to retain at least 14 aircraft carriers.
   President Bush is scheduled to deliver his 1991 budget to
Congress on Jan. 22, and he may be called upon to make the final
calls on the controversial suggestions.
   ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' the Pentagon official said
of the current budget-juggling exercise. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The fiscal 1991 spending plan is considered a key barometer of
the Pentagon's ability to respond to pressures from budget cutters
on Capitol Hill and in the Office of Management and Budget.
   White House budget planners have told Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney he can spend a little more than $292 billion in the new
budget year, which begins next Oct. 1.
   The Navy, like other services, is being forced to trim programs
it deems successful _ such as the Trident _ in order to meet these
goals, said the senior official.
   Asked whether the service was looking at stretching out the
annual purchases of the strategic submarines to every other year,
the official said, ``We're seriously considering it.''
   The sub's billion-dollar price tag has made it easy prey for
lawmakers advocating less lavish spending on strategic nuclear
weapons programs amid the warming of relations with the Soviet
Union.
   In November, the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics
Corp. in Groton, Conn., won a contract to build the 17th Trident
submarine. Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III has told Capitol
Hill he expects to request full funding for the 18th Trident
submarine in the fiscal 1991 budget.
   But due to its high cost and complexity, funds for the submarine
are stretched out over several years and Garrett made no mention
about long-term procurement funds for additional submarines.
   ``I'd put my money on some type of stretch-out,'' said another
Defense Department official, asked about the Trident program's
future.
   The official said it was ``premature'' to talk about an end to
the program, and said that if an every-other-year purchase policy
is adopted, ``it may not even compromise the long-term number'' of
submarines, widely expected to be 24.
   The service's World War II-era battleships also have become
targets of budget cutters on Capitol Hill, particularly in the
aftermath of last spring's explosion aboard the USS Iowa, which
claimed 47 sailors' lives.
   Even the chief of naval operations, Adm. Carlisle A. Trost,
admitted at one congressional hearing that the future of the four
warships was ``up for grabs'' in the budget debate. But the Navy
leadership is loathe to let the warships go, the senior official
said.
   ``Nobody _ not the Army, not the Marine Corps, not the Navy _
wants to give those ships up,'' the official contended, arguing
that their mobile firepower offers a major boost when a president
calls for a little ``gunship diplomacy.''
   ``The '91 (budget) plan calls for putting two in mothballs. But
we'd still have two and we want to hang onto those,'' he said.
   The official did not specify which of the four ships would be
retired.
   The second Defense Department official noted that congressional
pressure may work against mothballing the battleships, since their
home ports were to be dispersed among four states under a revised
program.
   ``Our phones rang off the hook'' from lawmakers unhappy about
Trost's suggestion of the ships' possible demise, the official said.
   The senior official said the Navy is fighting to save at least
14 aircraft carriers during the next fiscal year.
   One carrier _ the World War II-era Midway _ is scheduled for
retirement next year, which would bring the fleet from 15 to 14.
   ``Tell me, which commitment are we supposed to walk away from?''
the official asked, pointing out that the U.S. commitment to sail
the Indian Ocean and keep tabs on the potentially explosive Persian
Gulf haven't changed.
   The official also said the Navy's requirements most probably
will increase as the service is asked to place more power on the
high seas to advance the nation's war against illicit drug
traffickers.

<HEAD>DEA Rejects Relaxation of Marijuana Restrictions</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration, rejecting
a recommendation of its own chief judge, has refused to relax
restrictions on marijuana.
   The order by Administrator John C. Lawn, published Friday in the
Federal Register, means that marijuana will continue to be listed
under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, for substances
with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical
application, where it has been classified since the act was passed
in 1970.
   NORML, the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform,
petitioned three years ago to have the substance reclassified to
Schedule II, meaning it would remain unavailable to the general
public but could be prescribed by doctors for limited purposes.
   The DEA's chief administrative law judge, Francis L. Young,
recommended Sept. 6, 1988, that marijuana be placed on the less
restrictive schedule, calling it ``one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.''
   Young cited a number of medical experts and patients as saying
marijuana helped suppress nausea and vomiting experienced by cancer
patients receiving chemotherapy, and was effective in controlling
muscle spasms of patients with multiple sclerosis.
   ``The evidence in this record clearly shows that marijuana has
been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers
of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical
supervision,'' Young wrote. ``It would be unreasonable, arbitrary
and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers
and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this
record.''
   Lawn, in his order, said that Young ``failed to act as an
impartial judge in this matter.''
   ``He appears to have ignored the scientific evidence, ignored
the testimony of highly credible and recognized medical experts
and, instead, relied on the testimony of psychiatrists and
individuals who used marijuana,'' the administrator said.
   He also said that Young, in his findings of fact, ``ignored any
evidence presented by the government.''
   ``Mr. Lawn found that there was a lack of credible evidence to
support a conclusion that safety, efficacy and acceptance had been
demonstrated for the medical use of marijuana,'' the DEA said in a
news release.
   Young could not be reached for comment.
   Donald Fiedler, national director of NORML, said, ``The ruling
is arbitrary and capricious because it means doctors now don't have
that tool available to use marijuana as a medicine. Denying access
to medicine to those who need it is hypocrisy in the worst sense.''
   The DEA said physicians and scientists will be able to continue
to file proposals with it and with the Food and Drug Administration
for further research on medical aspects of marijuana.

   China's repression of pro-democracy protests was
the top world news event of 1989, an official newspaper said today.
   The pro-democray revolution in Eastern Europe came in second,
according to a list of the top 10 stories published in the China
Daily.
   The newspaper said the crushing of the student-led Chinese
rebellion in June, the election of Jiang Zemin as the new Communist
Party chief and China's renewed commitment to socialism were the
most significant events of the year.

   Hope for world peace was the New Year's
message from former President Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy as they
headed for the desert bash that has become a 22-year tradition.
   ``Their hope for 1990 is that all peoples of the world will live
in peace and freedom,'' Mark Weinberg, spokesman for the Reagans,
said Friday.
   The Reagans were spending the weekend at the estate of friend
and former ambassador Walter Annenberg. The annual pilgrimage to
the estate near Palm Springs has become a New Year's ritual for the
Reagans.
   Weinberg said the Reagans will socialize with friends, play golf
and watch football games on television during their stay at the
Annenberg compound 110 miles east of Los Angeles.

   Helge Ingstad, the Norwegian scientist and
explorer who discovered Leif Erikson's settlement in Newfoundland,
was honored on the eve of his 90th birthday.
   Television, radio and newspapers on Friday extolled Ingstad's
exploits. During excavations from 1960 to 1968, Ingstad and his
wife, archeologist Anne Stine Ingstad, found a concentration of
Norse homesteads at L'Anse aux Meadows in northern Newfoundland.
   Their findings showed that Norse people had sailed via Greenland
to settle in North America about the year 1000, or 500 years before
Columbus reached America.

   Author V.S. Naipaul was given knighthod, and
Maggie Smith was made a dame commander in honors announced today.
   The pair made Queen Elizabeth II's semiannual honors list, which
the government compiles. The queen actually bestows the honors at a
later ceremony.
   Naipaul, 57, a Trinidad-born writer, was made a Knight Bachelor.
The author of ``In a Free State,'' ``A Bend in the River'' and
``Enigma of Arrival'' came to Britain at age 17 on a scholarship to
Oxford University and has become one of the country's most
important writers.
   The honor entitles him to call himself Sir Vidiadhar, but his
work always appears with his initials.
   Maggie Smith, 55, one of Britain's finest stage actresses and an
Oscar-winner for ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' was made a Dame
Commander of the Order of British Empire, the equivalent of a
knighthood for a woman.
   Many of the 947 awards made in the New Year's list went to
emergency service staff who worked at Lockerbie, Scotland, after a

Mikhail S. Gorbachev would prefer to be left out in the cold when
it comes to advertisements for a decongestant.
   ``Heads of state don't endorse cold medicine,'' Bush spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Friday.
   Fitzwater objected to ads for Drixoral, an over-the-counter head
cold remedy manufactured by Schering-Plough Corp. The ads show
Gorbachev and Bush shaking hands at the superpower summit in Malta
earlier this month.
   ``In the New Year, may the only cold war in the world be the one
we're fighting,'' assert the advertisements.
   But the ads clearly are giving the White House a headache.
   ``We do not approve or sanction or acknowledge any of these
commercial endorsements and we appreciate the two television
networks that declined to run them,'' said Fitzwater.
   ABC and CBS have refused to carry the spot.

<HEAD>Engineers Report No Cracking in Military Nuclear Reactor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department after months of study
has dismissed the possibility of any cracking in one of the three
reactors at the Savannah River nuclear weapons complex. Studies of
the two other reactors are planned for next year.
   The determination of no cracking in P reactor is a major gain
for the department, which is in the midst of a $1.66 billion
program to repair and modernize the three reactors. They have been
closed for more than a year for safety reasons.
   Discovery of cracking in any of the reactor vessels likely would
put them permanently out of service since the 35-year-old vessels
are virtually irreplaceable.
   The Savannah River reactors are the nation's only source of
tritium, a radioactive gas used in nuclear warheads. Tritium decays
at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, so supplies in warheads must be
replenished periodically or the bombs cease to function.
   Barring any unforeseen problems such as vessel cracking, Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins hopes to restart K reactor by next fall;
the second, L reactor, by December 1990, and the third, P reactor,
in the spring of 1991.
   The Savannah River complex is located near Aiken, S.C.
   Last September, engineers of Westinghouse Savannah River Co.,
which runs the plant under an Energy Department contract, began
using a sophisticated new technology called ultrasonic testing to
check for cracks in the reactor vessels.
   Westinghouse and Watkins initially said completion of the tests
was not a precondition to restarting the reactors, but Watkins
changed his mind in late September after Westinghouse reported a
potential sign of cracking in P reactor. A few days later, he
announced that the irregularity was an existing weld repair that
would not affect the reactor's safety.
   The P reactor testing was completed Oct. 30.
   In Friday's report on results of ultrasonic testing at P
reactor, Westinghouse said there were no signs of cracking,
although several irregularities were found. It said these
irregularities were determined to be weld repairs done during
manufacture of the vessel, or other harmless abnormalities.
   ``In no case do any of these findings represent a concern with
respect to the structural integrity of the tank,'' the report said.
   In ultrasonic testing, high-frequency sound waves are passed
through the reactor vessel walls, and any abnormalities, including
cracks, show up as breaks in the waves.
   Becky Apter, a Westinghouse spokeswoman, said Friday that
ultrasonic testing at K reactor was scheduled to begin in
mid-January, but that it probably would be set back a week or 10
days because of delays in other work at the reactor.

<HEAD>Farmers Receive Record-High Prices in 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says farmers saw
prices rise again in December and are winding up 1989 as a year of
record-high prices, eclipsing the old 12-month record set five
years ago.
   Prices farmers got for raw products rose 0.7 percent from
November to December, leaving the monthly average 2.1 percent above
the level of December 1988.
   Higher prices for hogs, cattle, milk and eggs were mostly
responsible for the increase from the November average, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Friday in its final
report of the year. Lower prices were reported for lettuce,
oranges, cotton and broilers.
   Most of the price information was collected at mid-month before
the latest freeze that swept into Florida and Texas, destroying
citrus and vegetable crops. The preliminary figures will be revised
next month.
   The report said the December milk price was the highest on
record and that the average for hogs was the highest since October
1987.
   John Buche of the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service said the preliminary 12-month price average for all farm
commodities _ about 147 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison
_ is the highest on record.
   The previous high index reading was 142 percent in 1984, he
said. The 1988 average was 138 percent.
   No new figures were provided on prices farmers pay to meet
expenses. Due to budget restrictions, those are computed every
three months. In October, the ``prices paid'' index averaged 2.9
percent more than a year earlier.
   On Dec. 20, the department's Economic Research Service issued
income estimates showing that net cash income of farmers in 1989
may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with a
revised estimate of $57.2 billion in 1988.
   Department economists say the decline is due mostly to larger
expenses as they put more land back into crops, and to reduced
federal payments.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   Department projections for 1990 show net cash income ``likely
will exceed'' $50 billion for the fourth consecutive year.
   Consumer food prices are estimated by USDA economists to have
risen about 5.7 percent this year, the sharpest rise since 1981.
They project food prices may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the December price index for
livestock and poultry rose 2.4 percent from November and averaged
9.7 percent more than a year ago.
   The meat animal portion of the index was up 2.9 percent from
November and 8.4 percent from December 1988. Dairy prices rose 2.5
percent from November and 18 percent from a year ago.
   Department economists predict milk output will increase in 1990
and that the record price levels will recede.
   Earlier Friday, the department announced a 50-cent reduction in
the federal price support of milk beginning Jan. 1 to $10.10 per
100 pounds. The cut was ordered to help stem an expected rise in
surplus production in 1990.
   Under the dairy price support program, USDA buys surplus butter,
cheese and non-fat dry milk to bolster the price of milk at the
farm. With a lower support for 1990, officials say less surplus
production will be bought.
   Crop prices, overall, declined 1.6 percent from November and 8.1
percent from December 1988, including lower prices for fruit,
commercial vegetables and cotton. Food grains _ wheat and rice _
were up 2.7 percent from November but averaged 1.9 percent below a
year ago.

<HEAD>Recovery Plan Expected Next Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The new Panamanian government plans to present
economic recovery proposals to the United States next week that
will cover damages including looting that occurred when U.S. troops
overthrew dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, says the new ambassador
to the United States.
   The new ambassador, Carlos Rodriguez, said Friday night that
Panamanian experts working with an inter-agency U.S. team ``have
not quantified anything, and we are not demanding anything.''
   Asked about reports that war damage would amount to $3 billion
to $10 billion, he replied, ``It is not possible to quantify
matters with that degree of precision.''
   The economic recovery proposal ``was designed, prior to the
military action, to restore Panama's economy, but it has been
updated to reflect the military action,'' Rodriguez said in an
interview.
   ``There were damages, including the Chorillo area, and merchants
who suffered looting from the interruption in police services,'' he
said.
   Reports from Panama say supporters of Noriega set fire to the
Chorillo area, inhabited by many poor people near his old
headquarters. Some 13,000 people took shelter in a nearby athletic
complex.
   The Chamber of Commerce in Panama City has estimated damages
from looting alone in that city at $2 billion.
   A team of U.S. experts already has gone to Panama and hopes to
``make a presentation to the press on Tuesday of the same
proposals'' being put forward to the United States government,
Rodriguez said.
   U.S. sanctions against the Noriega regime over the past two
years have caused that nation's economy to shrink by an estimated
10 percent to 15 percent annually, some analysts have said.
   Some estimates put unemployment above 20 percent, and the
country of around 2\ million people has a foreign debt estimated at
$5.6 billion.
   Cash totaling $50 million was flown into Panama on Friday from
the United States, part of frozen assets now released. Panama has
no national currency of its own and uses U.S. dollars for all its
transactions.

<TEXT>
   Federal lawyers have dismissed William J. Keating
as a defendant in a $1.1 billion lawsuit stemming from the failure
of a savings and loan run by his brother, millionaire Charles H.
Keating Jr.
   The lawsuit accused Charles Keating, several family members, and
other senior executives of his American Continental Corp. of
devising a scheme to loot money from Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association of Irving, Calif., which American Continental owned.
   Federal regulators seized the thrift April 14, one day after
American Continental sought protection from its creditors under
federal bankruptcy law. The thrift's failure is expected to cost
taxpayers more than $2 billion.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency created to clean
up the savings and loan industry, filed the lawsuit under civil
fraud and racketeering statutes in U.S. District Court in September.
   William Keating, chief executive officer of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency and chairman of the board of The Associated Press,
wasn't accused of fraud and racketeering but was named in three of
15 counts and was accused of negligence and breach of fiduciary
duty.
   William Keating served for five months in 1986 on American
Continental's board of directors, said his lawyer, Chester T. Kamin
of Chicago.
   Resolution Trust Corp. lawyers filed notice Friday in federal
court that William Keating had been dismissed, without prejudice,
as a defendant in the case.
   Kamin said that because the dismissal is ``without prejudice,''
William Keating theoretically could be reinstated as a defendant in
the case. But it is unlikely that he would have been dismissed if
the government had any intention of including him in the
litigation, Kamin said.
   Michael C. Manning, a Phoenix lawyer who has represented the
Resolution Trust Corporation in the case, wasn't available for
comment Friday. His secretary said he was on vacation.
   P. John Owen, a Kansas City lawyer who signed the notice of
dismissal on behalf of the Resolution Trust Corporation, was out of
his office and unavailable until Tuesday, his secretary said.

   Reebok rip-offs? Converse copies? A phony Pony?
   Makers of prestige athletic shoes say counterfeit footwear is
big business and the feds agree, charging 18 people in what
allegedly was a scheme to sneak millions of Korean-made fakes into
the country.
   In unsealing an indictment Friday, U.S. Attorney Stephen McNamee
said investigators had broken up a ``worldwide conspiracy'' to sell
knockoffs of expensive brand-name shoes in the United States and
other countries.
   Eighteen people from three states and several foreign countries
were charged with violating U.S. trademark laws and
money-laundering, McNamee said. At least seven were arrested
Friday, he said, refusing to give names.
   Athletic shoes have become big money-makers, with some models
selling for more than $100 a pair.
   The case involves alleged copying of such popular brands as
Reebok, Converse and Pony.
   The indictment by a grand jury in Tucson names South Korean
businessman Dae Yun Hwang as head of the operation, and three other
South Koreans also are among those indicted.
   The counterfeit shoes were manufactured in Hwang's South Korean
factories and smuggled into the United States and other countries,
McNamee alleged.
   Other brands included Avia, Tiger, Puma, Adidas, L.A. Gear,
Nike, Jordache and Vans.
   The shoes were sold at flea markets and stores unauthorized to
carry those brands.
   The people charged were previously named in two civil lawsuits
by Reebok and Van Doren Rubber Co., the maker of Vans, said Harley
Lewin, a New York lawyer working for the shoemakers.
   The suits in U.S. District Court in San Diego seek a total of
$12 million in damages.
   ``We think that over a period of two years, in excess of two
million pairs of shoes were counterfeited,'' he said.
   The criminal investigation began Aug. 4 when Mexican customs
refused to allow 40 cartons of shoes across the border from
Nogales, Ariz., McNamee said.
   U.S. Customs agents found the shipment contained counterfeit
shoes bearing a number of brand-name labels. The shipment was
seized and a nationwide investigation was launched.
   Federal agents executed arrest and seizure warrants Thursday and
Friday, winding up a 4{-month investigation directed by the Customs
Service, McNamee said. Agents seized $4.5 million cash and other
assets from various defendants, he said.
   Authorities in Chile and Mexico also have made arrests in the
case, McNamee said.
   The case represents ``a notable victory against international
consumer fraud, money laundering and smuggling,'' U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said in a news release.
   Besides Hwang, McNamee identified those named in the indictment
as: B.S. Kim, M.K. Kim and H.S. Tae, all of South Korea; San Diego
residents Byron McLaughlin, Debbie Watson, Celeste Cota, Nathan
Betech, Marcos Betech, Abraham Betech, Isaac Paz and Herminia
Ascensio; Glenn McLaughlin of Iquique, Chile; Roman Trenka of San
Juan, Puerto Rico; Dudley W. Miller III of Boston; Sol Weisenberg
of Cincinnati; Natalie Ann Quaratino of Mexico City; and Jorge
Fitch Lazaro of Guaymas, Mexico.

<HEAD>Call-In Survey Reveals Insecurity Over Jobs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers feel insecure about their jobs and worry
about layoffs in 1990, an informal call-in survey found, and an
economic forecaster called it ``a very reasonable fear.''
   About 600 of the 1,100 people who phoned in during a one-day
survey were employed and 44 percent of them felt 1990 would bring
significant changes for them in the workplace, said the survey's
sponsor, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, an international
job-counseling firm.
   Workers calling from as far away as Los Angeles, Detroit, Boston
and Philadelphia said they worried about losing jobs to hostile
takeovers, economic decline and cutbacks and foreign competition,
Challenger said.
   ``People are worried that the security they once had ... is no
longer there,'' John Challenger, sales and marketing director for
the Chicago-based company, said Friday.
   The survey, conducted Thursday, is unscientific because it
reflects only the views of people who called in, rather than a
random sampling of the population.
   An economist at the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., said the survey's results could be expected.
   ``It's a very reasonable fear,'' said John Hagens, who
specializes in short-term economic forecasting. ``There will be
more cuts in 1990 and fewer new hires than we've had in '89 and '88
and '87.''
   ``For the first time in many years, the national unemployment
rate will rise,'' Hagens predicted in a telephone interview.
   The adjusted national unemployment rate stood at 5.4 percent in
November.
   Layoffs and early retirement plans in blue-chip companies like
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and International Business
Machines Corp. and throughout the computer and automobile
industries are signals that growth in employment is slowing, Hagens
said.
   He predicted employment growth in 1990 will be only 1.5 percent,
about half the 1989 rate.
   Challenger, with 16 offices in the United States and Europe,
counsels people who have been fired and referred by their former
companies. Each year during the week after Christmas, the firm
advertises its telephone number and opens phone lines to counsel
individuals for free.
   The survey results are compiled from information the firm
collects during the call-in.
   The majority, 59 percent, of the working callers to the survey
were under 40 and earned an average of $30,000 to $50,000, said
James Challenger, John's father and president of the company.
   About 58 percent of the workers also indicated they would be
willing to leave their city to find new work, which shows Americans
learned to enlarge the scope of their job search during the last
recession, James Challenger said.
   Unemployed workers who called, 76 percent of whom were 30 or
older, worried they won't be able to find jobs quickly in 1990 and
sought tips on job hunting and interviewing, said Ann Marks, a
consultant at the company.
   ``You hear real worry from people,'' Ms. Marks said. ``It's
tough to be out of work any time, but especially during the holiday
season.''
   The average time a person went unemployed in 1989 was 3.2
months, she said, but 85 percent to 90 percent found equal or
better paying jobs.
   Workers who find themselves unemployed in 1990 need to be
extremely aggressive in the narrowing and highly competitive job
market, Ms. Marks said.
   ``You've got to get plugging, go out and see the employers and
call if they don't,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Christmas freeze that devastated
much of South Florida's winter vegetable crop has left thousands of
migrant farm workers economically out in the cold.
   Families of workers from Mexico and Central America gather here
each winter to pick crops from Immokalee in south central Florida
to the tip of the peninsula, hoping to pay their expenses and
escape the bitter weather. But this year, they find themselves
broke and unemployed.
   ``They incur expenses coming down,'' said Ada Rojas, who helps
migrant workers solve their problems. ``Once they get here they are
in very bad shape. Christmas is gone by and they have very little
money.''
   The record Christmas weekend freeze killed up to 90 percent of
the winter vegetable crops in South Florida just as the migrants
arrived. The cold also heavily damaged the citrus of Central
Florida, but much of that can be turned to juice.
   The crowd at the Everglades labor camp on Friday was signing
petitions to get government help in paying their rent and for basic
expenses while they wait the six to eight weeks for another round
of vegetable crops to mature.
   ``It hit at a very bad time,'' said Jeanee Elswick, director of
the state's migrant labor program.
   About 2,000 migrants live at the drab camp of white trailers
lined up behind a chain-link fence amid open fields that border the
Everglades. It is one of three camps for migrants in Dade County.
   Florida officials want them to travel 200 miles north to help
with a desperate citrus harvest, but acknowledge the lack of
housing would be a problem in the citrus-rich counties.
   Migrants earn up to $35 on a productive day, so affordable
housing is critical.
   Trailers at the Everglades camp rent for $50 a week, but afford
enough room for the large families of the farm workers.
   Food stamps were already being distributed in the camp.
   ``We're not satisfied only with food stamps,'' said Ramon
Salinas, a veteran of the camp. ``If we have to go all the way to
Tallahassee, we will. We have to pay rent, utilities, buy clothes
for the kids.''
   The idle crowd at the Everglades camp included bored children
wearing Mickey Mouse shirts and grandmothers in sneakers ready to
work. Many of the families have up to six and seven children.
   Gov. Bob Martinez declared a disaster statewide Thursday and
asked the federal government to approve low-interest loans for
farmers. But he's still collecting information before asking for a
presidential disaster declaration that could bring emergency
unemployment benefits.
   The freeze also idled about 15,000 farmworker families in Texas'
Rio Grande Valley. Plans to open four centers for displaced
agricultural workers have been postponed while the American Red
Cross, the Texas Department of Human Services and Hidalgo County
work out details.
   About 60 percent of the Rio Grande Valley's $80 million citrus
crop was lost to the freeze; 80 percent, or $20 million worth, of
the region's remaining vegetable crop was destroyed.

   The country's revolutionary leadership
scrapped harsh food and gasoline rationing rules enforced by
executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu but invited other Communists to
join in reshaping Romania.
   The governing council of the National Salvation Committee, which
took power Dec. 22 during a popular uprising backed by the army,
moved to take full control of the country Friday and to prepare it
for free elections set for April.
   It also promised to remain in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
military alliance and to honor other international commitments.
   Meanwhile, the army said it had begun to try Ceausescu loyalists
who waged fierce battles against army forces and citizens during
the revolt.
   Romania's interim president, Ion Iliescu, signed decrees to lift
rules allowing motorists only 8 gallons of gasoline a month and
another that eliminated food rationing that kept people from eating
meat for months at a time.
   The government also halted food exports _ a key part of
Ceausescu's harsh economic policies _ and citrus fruits, coffee and
other items have appeared on store shelves for the first time in
ages.
   Iliescu also did away with a rule that banned private citizens
from meeting with foreigners or from offering them board and
lodging.
   Earlier in the day, the revolutionary government changed the
country's official name from the ``Socialist Republic of Romania''
to just ``Romania'' and removed the Communist symbol from the flag.
   However, Budapest radio in Hungary quoted Iliescu as saying in
an interview that members of the Communist Party will have a role
in a new democratic Romania.
   ``We are in a situation in which we have to ask all of our
society's forces to act in unity and to join forces,'' Iliescu said.
   ``Many Communist Party members are indispensible,'' he said.
   Ionescu told a news conference that several thousand forces
loyal to Ceausescu had surrendered or been captured.
   However, several hundred other members of Ceausescu's dreaded
Securitate remained in hiding, defying an order to surrender or
face execution, said Cazimir Ionescu, a vice president in the
National Salvation Committee's 145-member governing council.
   The council had ordered the Securitate holdouts to surrender by
5:00 p.m. Thursday or face death.
   The Military Council, which takes orders from the fledgling
government, issued a ``last call'' for surrender by
anti-revolutionary forces. It said those who refuse to do so will
face trial and be ``summarily sentenced.''
   An army statement said its forces were ``in full control in all
parts ... of the country'' and that military tribunals set up to
try the special police forces had begun their work ``and will
continue to try all acts of terrorism.''
   It gave no indication of how many trials had been held.
   Romania's uprising began on Dec. 15 with demonstrations in
Timisoara. The protests spread and Ceausescu and his wife, Elena,
fled their palace in Bucharest on Dec. 22 after the army sided with
the citizens.
   The couple was captured a day later, then shuttled about in a
constantly moving armored car for the last three days of their
lives, Britain's Independent Television News said. It quoted Capt.
Mihail Lupoi, identified as a senior army official, as saying that
Ceausescu was kept in the moving car to prevent rescue attempts.
   The Ceausescus were executed Monday after they were convicted at
a secret trial of crimes against the state during his 24-year rule.
   Romania's former defense minister was given a hero's funeral on
Friday. Gen. Vasile Milea died of a gunshot wound Dec. 22, senior
officers have said.
   Before fleeing, Ceausescu had denounced Milea and claimed he had
committed suicide. But Romania's new leaders say he was executed
for refusing to order army troops to fire on demonstrators.
   Milea's funeral in a small hall at the Military Academy was
shown on national TV.
   The new leadership received support and recognition Friday from
several Western countries, including the United States. A special
envoy of President Francois Mitterrand of France met with first
deputy president Dumitru Mazilu.
   Romania's new leaders are likely to meet the leaders of the six
other Warsaw Pact countries for the first time in Sofia, Bulgaria,
on Jan. 9.
   The Soviet-led Eastern trading bloc Comecon also meets for its
annual congress on that day.
   It will be the first time that the leaders of the seven Warsaw
Pact countries will gather since all of their nations embraced
democratic reforms.

   Student demonstrators who helped
topple Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu say they will take to
the streets again if the provisional government strays from the
path of democracy.
   Students were among the anti-government protesters who shouted
down Ceausescu at an official rally in Palace Square on Dec. 21,
and they were among those killed when security forces opened fire.
   Now in the days following the ouster and execution of Ceausescu,
the students say they have an obligation to those who have fallen
to guarantee the reforms.
   ``We don't have any weapons but to protest. We can do nothing
but strike,'' said Diana Ghionea, an education student and veteran
of the bloody demonstrations that helped trigger the revolution.
   ``We have two representatives in the provisional government. If
they (the others) don't listen to them we will be organizing a
protest and a strike,'' said Diana Voicu, another young veteran.
   Student demonstrations are new to a country where Ceausescu
crushed dissent movements during his autocratic 24-year rule.
   ``It's nobility around here to be able to say you were in the
square on Thursday,'' said Ms. Ghionea, referring to the day they
shouted down the dictator.
   ``I was almost killed three times over that weekend but my
friends saved me, pulling me aside in the shooting,'' she said.
   Older Romanians praise the students for their courage, telling
reporters that nothing would have started, would have been
possible, without the students.
   But the students worry that the people will settle for too
little. They hope for the best from the self-proclaimed provisional
government but intend to hold it to its promise of free elections
and national reform.
   ``There is change now. The people are so happy to get rid of
Ceausescu that they think anything will be better,'' said Ms.
Ghionea.
   ``We didn't have food until now, and now we have TV. We had only
two hours of TV now we have eight. The old people think this is
freedom. They think, `What do the students want?' This is not
freedom.''
   Other students at the university nodded approval as the young
women told reporters that the students have a debt to all of those
who died in overthrowing the dictatorship.
   The students met Thursday to form the Democratic Student League,
a group they say will push for educational reform and seek
educational assistance from abroad for the university.
   Ms. Ghionea and Ms. Voicu insisted the league would be
apolitical, seeking only to improve the educational system. It
seeks to shorten the hours in class from 10 to eight a day, to
raise education standards, to end political interference in the
curriculum and end compulsory military training for women.
   ``Ceausescu wanted to keep us in class so long that we would not
have time to meet and to think,'' said Ms. Voicu.
   The students said they will not allow the league to become an
instrument of their political dissent because educational reforms
are so vital.
   But they emphasize that does not mean the students will not
become political, that they will not take to the streets again to
try to preserve their vision of the revolution.
   Ms. Ghionea echoes the voices of so many other, older Romanians.
   ``We can't go back again,'' she says. ``We can't.''

<HEAD>Disability Benefits To Rise Jan. 1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New rules taking effect the first day of the
new year will raise the amount of money recipients of government
disability benefits can earn, says the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said Friday that the increases
``will serve as an additional incentive for many disabled Americans
to return to work and improve the quality of life for themselves
and their families.''
   The rules will affect recipients of Supplemental Security Income
program and the Social Security Disability Insurance program who
are not blind.
   Under the disability insurance program, recipients are allowed
to earn up to a certain amount and still receive benefits. On Jan.
1, that level will increase for the first time in more than a
decade.
   The new rules will change the trigger for the ``trial work
period'' during which a disability insurance recipient continues to
receive benefits for nine months after returning to work. Since
January 1979, a recipient has entered a ``trial work period'' when
he earns more than $75 per month or works more than 15 hours per
week. That will increase to $200 or 40 hours.
   Also under the disability insurance program, when the
recipient's earnings reach the ``substantial gainful activity''
level, which has been set at $300 per month since January 1980,
benefits can continue only under certain conditions. That trigger
will rise to $500.

<NOTE>NIH Scrapping Conflict-of-Interest Guidelines</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health is scrapping
proposed conflict-of-interest guidelines that stirred controversy
among scientists and will begin laboring anew to draft new options,
officials say.
   The guidelines proposed for the federal research agency last
September were an attempt to ensure the integrity of
government-funded projects by preventing researchers from having a
financial interest in the outcome of their work.
   But many scientists said the proposal would hamper efforts to
turn academic research into commercial products and could cost the
United States its competitive edge in biomedical research.
   The proposal suggested that NIH grant recipients disclose their
and their families' financial interests and said government-funded
researchers should have no equity interest in any company that
would benefit from their research. It also proposed barring
researchers from sharing information with companies until it is
publicly available.
   NIH received more than 600 comments on the proposal, said NIH
spokeswoman Ann Thomas.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and
Human Services, said Friday that he has asked NIH to submit to him
new options ``that properly treat potential abuse while keeping the
research process free of unnecessary burdens and disincentives.''

   California will receive a nearly four-fold
increase in federal money for anti-drug abuse programs in the
Justice Department's first allocation of state aid under a
stepped-up program approved by Congress, the department says.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Friday that the money is
part of the Bush administration's efforts to help communities
``attack the problem at the point of consumption.''
   He said the department is urging states to incorporate
recommendations of President Bush's national drug control strategy
into their programs.
   California, the first state to receive funds for fiscal year
1990, will get $39.7 million, almost $30 million more than its 1989
grant of $10.8 million. Under a plan adopted by California, nearly
65 percent of the money will be distributed to local communities.
   The department said its Bureau of Justice Assistance is
receiving and reviewing grant applications from other states.
Congress appropriated $395 million for the grants.

<TEXT>
   Authorities discovered three tons of
dynamite hidden in washing machines and other appliances warehoused
in an area of the capital where drug barons planned to attack
police, an official said.
   Also Friday, security forces said they captured a top Medellin
drug cartel member wanted in the United States.
   In another case, authorities said a judge illegally freed the
brother of one of Colombia's top cocaine kingpins, both of whom are
also wanted by U.S. authorities.
   The dynamite was found Thursday night inside dozens of washing
machines and other appliances stored in a warehouse in southern
Bogota, the chief of the secret police, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez,
said Friday.
   ``This entire arsenal belonged to the Medellin cartel,'' he told
reporters outside the warehouse. ``We have dismantled its principal
terrorist network.''
   The explosives were to be used to avenge the Dec. 15 police
slaying of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the No. 2 man in Medellin
cartel, a police news release said.
   Security was increased in Bogota on Friday because authorities
found evidence at the warehouse suggesting that either a bus or
another large vehicle had already been packed with dynamite and
sent into the city, Maza Marquez said.
   The number of military checkpoints was increased in the capital,
and extra soldiers were posted at the Defense Ministry and police
stations.
   The captured drug suspect, Jose Ocampo Obando, was arrested
Friday in the banana-growing region of Uraba on Colombia's northern
coast, the Defense Ministry said in a news release.
   The ministry did not say where Ocampo Obando is wanted in the
United States. Colombia has extradited 11 suspected traffickers to
the United States in the last four months.
   Ocampo Obando is considered by Colombian authorities to be the
fifth-most important member of the Medellin cartel.
   In the western city of Cali, an army general said a judge
illegally released the brother of the leader of the Cali cartel,
the other main cocaine ring in Colombia.
   The judge had no reason to release Jorge Rodriguez Orejuela, who
was wanted for extradition to the United States, army Gen. Jose
Manuel Bonnett said at a news conference Friday in Cali.
   Rodriguez Orejuela's brother is Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela,
said by Colombian authorities to be the billionaire leader of the
Cali cartel based in the city of the same name.
   Since the government of President Virgilio Barco declared war on
traffickers on Aug. 18, they have responded with 203 bombings that
have killed 199 people and injured 1,238.
   Maza Marquez said that many of the car bombs used in the attacks
had been prepared in the warehouse raided Thursday night.
   Police also received tips from callers saying they belonged to
bands of criminals fighting for control of Rodriguez Gacha's drug
empire, which generates billions of dollars each year.
   Authorities have said the struggle has resulted in the murders
of 34 people during the last two weeks.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it opens next month, a shelter for homeless
veterans will offer help with housing and job searches and a chance
``to come and heal,'' the center's founder says.
   ``This is about Americans helping Americans, veterans helping
veterans,'' Ken Smith, president of the Vietnam Veterans Workshop
in Boston, said Friday in announcing the opening of the shelter.
   ``All these guys ever wanted to do is come home,'' he said.
   Smith, who was overcome by emotion as he made his remarks, was
surrounded by fellow veterans as he stood in the room that will be
home to the shelter starting Jan. 8.
   ``This is my dream, and it's very unusual to see your dreams
come to fruition,'' he said.
   The vacant downtown facility had been a clinic run by the
Veterans Administration. It was awarded to the Boston veterans
group under federal legislation that provides excess government
property for helping the homeless.
   The shelter will have space for 100 beds, and it will offer
counseling on drug and alcohol abuse, housing, job searches and
veterans benefits. The shelter also plans to offer workshops on the
history of Vietnam to help veterans understand their involvement in
the war.
   ``This is a place to come and heal, to come heal the pain and
network with other veterans,'' Smith said.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, who participated in the ceremony, noted
that the veterans who returned from World War II were greeted with
many federal programs to ease their adjustment.
   ``Yet at the same time, there was no period when we have had as
little money spent on housing as the time when the Vietnam vet came
back to America,'' Flynn said.
   About 1,200 veterans in Boston are homeless, and about 30
percent of the nation's homeless are veterans, Smith said.
   ``I work in an ambulance at night and I see a lot of homeless
veterans,'' Smith said. ``I was finding my brothers sleeping on
grates, seeing people sleep under the BU (Boston University)
bridge.''
   Many still suffer the mental effects of combat violence, he
said, and others are too proud to seek help.
   But he said the homeless shelter should help people overcome any
shame since they will encounter and be assisted by other veterans.
   The shelter will operate with volunteers and private donations.
Officials estimate the annual cost of running the shelter will be
at least $350,000.
   One of the volunteers at the shelter, Eric Morse, of Cambridge,
was himself a homeless veteran until Smith's group helped him find
a job and a place to live last year.
   During the time he was homeless, Morse said he roamed the
streets and went to different shelters, but he had trouble finding
anyone to help him.
   ``Veterans care for each other more,'' he said.

   A man took $10,000 from the bank at about 12:50 p.m. Friday.
   Police, alerted by Olson, arrived moments later, according to
Detective Capt. Vincent Foley.
   Though the robber had already disappeared, the robbery was
recorded by bank security cameras. Albany detectives and FBI agents
said Friday they were searching for Arthur J. DeLorenzo, 29, of
Schenectady, for questioning in the robbery.
   The robber didn't have a weapon, police said.

   Nicaragua's ambassador to Panama said
U.S. troops searched his residence Friday, and the Managua
government responded by ordering 20 U.S. diplomats to leave
Nicaragua.
   President Daniel Ortega, in Managua Friday night, also ordered
the embassy to cut its service and administrative staff from 320
people to 100 people. It was not known how many staffers are
American.
   Ortega said the diplomats will be given 72 hours to leave the
country after their names are made public.
   It was not immediately known if the head of the embassy, charge
d'affairs John Leonard, was among those to be ordered to leave.
   Nicaragua's ambassador to Panama, Antenor Ferrey, said American
troops searched his residence for about two hours. He said he and
several other people waited outside during that time.
   The troops seized five rifles that Ferrey said were kept at the
residence for self-defense. A U.S. Army colonel in charge of the
operation later apologized and returned the rifles, Ferrey said.
   U.S. Embassy and military officials said they had no information
on the incident.
   American troops have surrounded the embassy since the Dec. 20
invasion that toppled dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. But they had
not assembled outside the the residence, a cluster of three homes
in an upper-middle class neighborhood. People living near the
residence said Friday they heard gunfire and shouts ordering people
to come out of the residence.
   Ferrey said Ortega told him by telephone that Nicaragua's
Sandinista government planned to protest the incident at the United
Nations and the Organization of American States.
   Ortega said in announcing the expulsions that the incident was
``unheard of. ... They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!''
   ``This violates the principal foundations of the
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions,'' Ferrey told a news
conference. ``The North Americans are going to pay for it.''
   Ferrey said he returned from Nicaragua's embassy at 6:10 p.m.
EST to discover about 60 U.S. troops had cordoned off several
blocks surrounding the residence.
   The unidentified U.S. Army colonel told Ferrey to go inside the
residence, then the troops used a megaphone to order everyone
inside to evacuate within five minutes, Ferrey said.
   The colonel said he had been given orders to search the
residence for weapons, Ferrey said. A U.S. C-130 transport plane
and a helicopter flew overhead.
   The Nicaraguans eventually came outside and about 30 of the
American soldiers went inside, Ferrey said, adding he was prevented
from accompanying the troops. ``They searched the whole house,'' he
said.
   Ferrey described the five rifles as ``only light arms used to
defend ourselves.''
   He said the colonel ordered the arms placed in a U.S. military
truck but later gave them back and apologized, saying there had
been a mistake.
   The troops left the area of the residence shortly before 9:30
p.m. EST. Ferrey said the U.S. troops had fired shots into the air
before he arrived.
   In the Nicaraguan capital of Managua, a state-run Voice of
Nicaragua report cited embassy employees as saying the troops
``fired in the air and intimidated the people inside and forced
them to come out with their arms in the air.''
   On Thursday, Cuba protested that its ambassador and another
diplomat had been detained an hour by troops surrounding the Cuban
Embassy. U.S. officials denied the ambassador had been detained and
said the other official had forgotten his diplomatic credentials,
which eventually were retrieved.
   A senior U.S. Embassy official said Thursday that under the
terms of the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic procedures,
U.S. troops had the right to search those entering and leaving
missions for weapons and non-diplomatic personnel.

   President Daniel Ortega said Friday
that 20 American diplomats will be expelled in retaliation for an
incident at the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama.
   Ortega also ordered the embassy to cut its service and
administrative staff from 320 people to 100 people. It was not
immediately known how many are American.
   The 20 diplomats will be given 72 hours to leave Nicaragua after
their names are made public, Ortega said in the announcement
broadcast nationwide by a government radio network.
   The announcement came just hours after Nicaragua's amabassador
to Panaman, Antenor Ferrey, said U.S. troops surrounded his
residence in Panama City, ordered all personnel inside to evacuate
and searched the building for weapons.
   Ortega called the diplomatic incident ``unheard of.''
   The troops seized five rifles inside the residence that Ferrey
said were there for self-defense. A U.S. Army colonel in charge of
the operation later apologized and returned the rifles, Ferrey said.
   ``They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!'' Ortega said of the
incident. ``We were at grave risk a political-military clash with
the United States, which has maintained an aggressive attitude
against Latin American countries.''
   Ortega claimed the U.S. soldiers ``stole more than $2,000 and
took away some clothes from the residence.''
   U.S. Embassy and military officials said they had no information
on the incident.
   Ortega's announcement also said the U.S. Embassy will be forced
to ``compact its 220 of its personnel of 320, leaving only 100 in
service.'' This was taken to mean that another 220 embassy
employees, mostly Nicaraguan administrative and service personnel,
will also be forced to leave their jobs.
   It was not immediately clear if the embassy had that many
support personnel. The phones of the embassy and the homes of
several senior officers were either not answered or rang busy.
   U.S. diplomatic representation in Nicaragua was lowered when
Ortega's leftist Sandinista regime expelled Ambassador Richard
Melton and eight other American diplomats in July 1988, accusing
them of meddling in Nicaragua's affairs.
   The government accused the diplomats of inciting street
demonstrations against the Sandinista regime. The U.S. denied the
accusation.
   Since then, the embassy has been headed by charge d'affairs John
Leonard, and relations have not been too cordial.
   Diplomatic tension between the countries has been increasing
since U.S. troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20 and deposed strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   American troops have been surrounding the Nicaraguan Embassy
offices in Panama City along with those of the Cuban and Libyan
embassies.

   The United States praised the Vatican
on Friday for its efforts to ease Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out
of the Vatican mission where he has taken refuge, and U.S. forces
detained two more top aides to the increasingly isolated former
dictator.
   The Vatican said, however, it would take steps _ which it did
not specify _ if U.S. harassment of the papal embassy and Noriega
does not stop.
   ``The nuncio is doing his best to convince General Noriega to
abandon the nunciature on his own, by himself,'' said Joaquin
Navarro, Vatican spokesman in Rome. ``At the same time he cannot
force Noriega to leave nor can he consign him to U.S forces.''
   For Noriega, leaving the embassy would be tantamount to
surrendering to U.S. troops posted 10 feet from the gate. The
troops are inspecting all cars, including that of papal nuncio
Sebastian Laboa.
   President Guillermo Endara said he expects Noriega ``to be
invited out of the nuniciature soon. That's what we want.'' He said
this would be ``within days.''
   U.S. forces detained Noriega's personal doctor and chief
economic adviser, bringing to six the number of top aides that have
been arrested or have surrendered by leaving the embassy the last
48 hours. Those reported in custody include Michael Harari, an
Israeli security adviser and close aide to Noriega.
   Late in the afternoon U.S. troops turned down the volume on
music that has been blaring through the neighborhood around the
embassy. The music was still loud, but not as deafening at 150
yards as before.
   U.S. troops later surrounded the residence of Nicaraguan
Ambassador Antenor Ferrey and refused to let reporters within 100
yards. Shots were fired nearby, but their origin could not be
determined.
   The ambassador at an evening news conference said all personnel
inside were ordered to evacuate and the premises were searched for
weapons.
   ``This violates the principal foundations of the
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions,'' Ferrey said. ``The
North Americans are going to pay for it.''
   In Nicaragua later Friday, President Daniel Ortega said 20
American diplomats will be expelled in retaliation for the
incident, which he called ``unheard of.''
   Ortega also said the U.S. Embassy will be forced to ``compact
its 220 of its personnel of 320, leaving only 100 in service.'' It
was not immediately known how many are American.
   Ferrey said American troops that searched the building for about
two hours seized five rifles inside the residence. Ferrey said the
guns were for self-defense.
   A U.S. Army colonel in charge of the operation later apologized
and returned the rifles, Ferrey said.
   The troops left the area about 9:30 p.m. EST after staying about
four hours. Witnesses said more than 60 troops had arrived at the
residence in trucks and armored cars.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman William Barr said he knew nothing of the
incident. Air Force Col. Ronald Sconyers at Southern Command also
said he had no information.
   In a separate incident, a Cuban diplomat, press attache Jorge
Sosa Chacon, was briefly detained by American soldiers and then
released. It was the second such detention in as many days at the
Cuban Embassy.
   The first members of the country's new security forces were
patrolling streets Friday. A U.S. military source said most had
been members of Noriega's dismantled Defense Forces, although
nearly all Noriega's top officers are believed jailed in military
installations run by the United States.
   Also Friday, the remains of an American teacher were discovered
in Panama and his daughter blamed Panamanians for his death.
   The American _ the third U.S. civilian to die since the conflict
began _ was identified by his daughter as Raymond Dragseth, a
teacher at the Panama Canal College, a Defense Department facility.
   Dragseth was reported to be the uncle of Richard Paul, a Defense
Department dependent who was killed a week ago. An American who was
working in Panama as a school teacher, Candy Helin, was killed
shortly after the invasion began.
   Carolyn Dragseth, appearing at a news conference from Panama
broadcast by CNN television, blamed Panamanians for the abduction
of her father, saying, ``They just took my father _ I don't know
why.''
   ``They came here looking for Americans,'' she said. CNN said
Raymond Dragseth was abducted from the family's apartment several
hours after the American invasion began Dec. 20.
   At the United Nations, the General Assembly adopt a resolution
by a 75-20 Friday that ``strongly deplores'' the U.S. invasion.
Sponsored by Nicaragua and Cuba, the resolution demands the
withdrawal of 26,000 U.S. troops and calls the military action a
flagrant violation of international law.
   The new Panamanian government under Endara voted against the
resolution.
   In other developments, estimates of the damage in the looting
spree that tore through Panama City after the attack climbed to $2
billion, according to the Chamber of Commerce.
   Panamanians continued working to recover from the chaos and
destruction that followed the U.S. invasion. Newspapers ran ads
asking people who looted merchandise to bring back the goods and
offered rewards with no questions asked.
   The toppled strongman was holed up inside the two-story embassy,
keeping largely to his room and speaking to few people, according
to a parish priest familiar with conditions inside the nunciature.
   Speaking at a news conference, Endara said Noriega is staying
``in the same room, sleeping in the same bed, watching the same
television I watched when I took refuge there.'' Endara also took
refuge at the embassy after Noriega's henchman botched the May 7
presidential election won by Endara.
   Endara also announced $50 million had been flown in by plane
from the United States Friday as part of the Panamanian assets
released after being frozen by the Bush administration last year to
pressure Noriega economically.
   During the night the troops flooded the embassy with light and
on Friday added a loudspeaker to their outdoor stereo system.
   The music, which includes rap and rock, prevents journalists in
a nearby hotel from eavesdropping but the noise also seems intended
to get on Noriega's nerves and includes numerous taunting songs.
   Navarro said disturbances created by U.S. troops were not
helping talks and hinted measures would be taken.
   ``If this is going to continue, further steps will be taken'' by
the Vatican, Navarro said without elaborating.
   In Corpus Christi, Texas, where President Bush is vacationing,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater played down the deadlock.
   ``It's a very difficult situation, very tense circumstances.
They are managing a difficult situation,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   For the first time since the invasion, there was no fighting
reported.
   When Noriega showed up at the papal nunciature Christmas Eve, he
created a diplomatic problem for all sides.
   The United States and Panama say Noriega is a criminal, wanted
on drug trafficking charges in Florida, not a political refugee,
and therefore the nuncio has no obligation to keep him.

   An appeals court has overturned the murder
conviction of a man who said police beat him and put a plastic bag
over his head to make him confess.
   The court said that when a defendant is injured in custody, the
prosecution must show by ``clear and convincing evidence that the
injuries were not inflicted as a means of producing the
confession.''
   A three-judge panel of the 1st District Illinois Court of
Appeals, ruling Thursday, ordered a new trial for Gregory Banks.
   Banks testified that while police interrogated him in 1983, Sgt.
John Byrne hit him with a flashlight while his hands were
handcuffed behind his back and stuck a pistol in his mouth,
threatening to shoot.
   Banks also said Sgt. Peter Dignan, then a detective, said ``we
have something for niggers,'' then put a plastic bag over his head
for more than a minute while Detective Charles Grunhard kicked him.
Banks said that when Dignan put the bag over his head again about
10 minutes later, he confessed.
   Dignan testified he tackled Banks when he tried to escape while
handcuffed. But the appellate court cited testimony from a doctor
at Cook County Hospital that Banks' injuries weren't of a type that
would be inflicted in a tackle.
   Dignan said people convicted of murder often claim they were
brutalized, and called the allegation that police used a plastic
bag ridiculous.
   ``Banks is a huge fellow, and he's guilty as sin,'' Dignan said.
``He did flee, and I tackled him. I got an elbow in the face and I
punched back.''
   Banks was convicted in 1984 of robbing and killing Leon Barkan
in a drug-related dispute. Cook County Circuit Judge Robert L.
Sklodowski sentenced him to 50 years in prison.
   Sklowodski said that in making his ruling, he had to evaluate
the credibility of the witnesses. He said he took into account the
fact that Banks was appearing in repeat offender's court, were
defendents have two previous felony convictions.

   President Daniel Ortega ordered 20
American diplomats to leave the country in retaliation for a search
by U.S. troops of the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence in Panama.
   In a national radio broadcast late Friday, Ortega said he had
given the U.S. diplomats 72 hours to leave the country.
   He also said he had ordered the U.S. mission to reduce its
support staff from 320 people to 100. Many people who work at the
embassy are Nicaraguan nationals.
   A Nicaraguan government source said there were about 35
accredited U.S. diplomatic personnel in Nicaragua.
   Attempts to reach U.S. Embassy officials by telephone were not
immediately successful.
   Earlier Friday, Nicaraguan Ambassador Antenor Ferrey said U.S.
troops surrounded his residence, ordered all personnel to evacuate
and searched the premises for weapons. U.S. officials said they had
no information on the incident.
   ``They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!'' Ortega said. ``We were
at grave risk of a political-military clash with the United States,
which has maintained an aggressive attitude against Latin American
countries.''
   Ferrey said he and nine other people waited outside the
residence while about 30 American troops searched the building for
about two hours.
   The soldiers seized five rifles that Ferrey said were there for
self-defense. A U.S. Army colonel in charge of the operation later
apologized and returned the rifles, Ferrey said.
   Nicaraguan government sources, who insisted on anonymity, said
that Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto was conducting unspecified
``diplomatic contacts'' with U.S. charge d'affaires John Leonard,
the foreign ministers of Spain and Mexico, and Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez.
   The sources said D'Escoto also contacted top officials at the
United Nations and the Organization of American States, but the
sources refused to give details concerning these contacts.
   Leonard is the top U.S. diplomat in Nicaragua.
   The United States has not had an ambassador to Managua since
July 1988, when the leftist Sandinista government expelled
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats to
protest alleged American interference in an opposition rally in the
city of Nandaime.
   The United States responded by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador
Carlos Tunnerman.
   Diplomatic tensions between the two countries increased after
the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama and the overthrow of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega. The Sandinistas placed the armed forces on
``maximum alert'' after the invasion.
   American troops surrounded the Nicaraguan, Cuban and Libyan
embassies in Panama City following speculation that pro-Noriega
loyalists had sought refuge in the missions.
   Nicaragua responded by briefly positioning military units around
the U.S. Embassy in Managua, then withdrew them.
   Earlier this week, the Sandinista government barred a State
Department plane from making its monthly supply run to the U.S.
Embassy in Managua. The aircraft normally carries mail, books and
supplies for the embassy Px.

   The head of the Communist Party renewed his
attack on reform movements while officials took steps to halt
students' display of support for Romania's revolution.
   ``The Chinese Communist Party and China are at a critical moment
and we should continue to keep the domestic political situation
stable,'' party General Secretary Jiang Zemin said Friday.
   ``The fight against bourgeois-liberalism is a long-term and
strenuous task,'' he told a party forum in a speech described as
important by the official radio and television, which reported on
it at length. A summary was issued by the Xinhua News Agency.
   It was Jiang's first publicized speech since Romania's hard-line
Communist leadership was ousted last week by a popular uprising.
Chinese college students celebrated by putting up several protest
posters.
   Authorities since have increased surveillance and political
study.
   Jiang said the party showed its strength by crushing
pro-democracy protests in June and ``smashing the efforts by
hostile foreign forces to foist on China a so-called peaceful
evolution'' away from socialism.
   Bourgeois-liberalism is the catch-phrase for Western democratic
ideas. In private, Chinese party officials have denounced Eastern
Europe's turn from communist rule as bourgeois-liberal and
revisionist.
   In his publicized comments Jiang did not mention Romania or the
democratic changes that have swept the rest of Eastern Europe.
However, his remarks appeared to be directed at the challenge
presented by these changes.
   He also said the party needs to perfect its leadership and
strengthen ideological education and discipline.
   ``The rampant corruption which has come to public notice in
recent years has aroused the discontent of the masses,'' Jiang
said, ``and effective measures should be adopted to resume the
close ties the party once maintained with the masses of the
people.''
   Despite repeated campaigns in recent years, however, the party
has shown itself unable to wipe out corruption stemming from party
members' privileged position in society.
   Xinhua said Jiang stressed ``that the party should trust the
masses of the people and depend on them absolutely.'' However,
police have stepped up patrols on Beijing college campuses since
the Romanian uprising.

   Police said today they believe Vietnamese boat
people may torch their detention centers or take hostages to
prevent authorities from forcibly repatriating them to their
impoverished homeland.
   Police also said officers may have to open fire on boat people
if violence in the squalid camps worsens.
   The comments came one day after boat people in the Chi Ma Wan
Detention Center armed with Molotov cocktails, homemade swords and
stones attacked security forces sent to conduct a weapons search.
   ``If police are attacked in closed quarters, police will be
justified to open fire,'' Barry Deegan, deputy Regional Commander
of the Marine Police, said at a news conference on the riot.
   About half of the 3,227 boat people at the camp already have
been denied refugee status and are considered illegal immigrants
facing forced repatriation.
   The Hong Kong government claims they do not qualify for refugee
status because they did not flee persecution but instead sailed
into this British colony to seek a better life.
   Since a first group of 51 boat people were forcibly repatriated
earlier this month, there have been several demonstrations against
the program at Chi Ma Wan and other camps.
   Police issued a statement today that said: ``Male inmates are
believed to have prepared a number of contingency plans to counter
any moves by the authorities to remove them.''
   ``Such plans include lighting fires inside the camps, stoning
the authorities, arming themselves with homemade weapons and
possible hostage- taking,'' the statement said.
   Deegan said some of these tactics were used Friday by boat
people who threw stones, 40 Molotov cocktails and burning blankets
at police and prison officers. Other Vietnamese used swords and
lances.
   Police fired more than 140 tear gas cannisters to disperse the
mob, Deegan said. Fourteen boat people and 24 police officers and
guards were injured. Twenty-five Vietnamese were arrested.
   Prison officers found more than 700 weapons, many made from
water pipes, laundry racks and bed posts.
   About 44,000 Vietnamese who sailed into Hong Kong after mid-June
1988 face repatriation if they cannot prove they fled persecution.
Some 12,000 others in the camps who arrived earlier were
automatically granted refugee status and can be resettled overseas.

<TEXT>
   About 33,000 Japanese crowded into Tokyo's
international airport as the New Year holiday exodus began, and
about 420,000 people are expected to head for Hawaii, Hong Kong and
other vacation spots.
   ``The estimated total is up 10.6 percent from the same period a
year earlier,'' said Akihiro Furukawa of the Japan Travel Bureau, a
major Japanese travel agency.
   Government officials have said travel represents one of the most
promising areas for Japan to increase its ``imports'' and offset
its trade surpluses.
   Japan's travel deficit stood at $19 billion in 1988, when the
country's merchandise trade surplus reached $95 billion, according
to Japanese figures.
   The Transportation Ministry said Friday an estimated 9.64
million Japanese have traveled abroad this year, up 14.2 percent
from a year ago.
   Hawaii is the most popular New Year destination, expected to
draw 68,000 Japanese, travel agents say. Another 49,000 are bound
for the U.S. West Coast and 13,000 for Canada, they said.
   Other popular destinations are Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore,
Thailand and the South Pacific.
   Many Japanese never take the vacations to which they are
entitled, meaning their only time off from work comes during the
New Year holiday and a string of public holidays in late April and
early May, with perhaps some vacation days used to stretch those
periods.
   Many companies remain closed this year from Friday through
Thursday, although some Japanese began their travels last weekend.
   The average Japanese will spend $2,800, if souvenir shopping is
included, on an average six-day stay abroad, Furukawa said.
   A booming domestic economy is fueling the travel surge, he said.
This country's strong currency makes foreign travel relatively
cheaper for Japanese, too. The Japanese yen has climbed from about
242 yen to the dollar in late 1985 to the current 143 yen.

   A Greek freighter's 28-member crew worked to
keep the 600-foot ship afloat while it headed slowly to Hawaii, the
Coast Guard said.
   Sailors aboard the scrap-metal carrier Bulka, foundering about
800 miles northeast of Hawaii, used four pumps and were trying to
get a fifth started in an effort to keep the ship from sinking,
Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hubbard said Friday night.
   The Bulka was listing 6 degrees to starboard and was down 40
feet at the bow, Hubbard said. Earlier Friday, the bow had been
down only 15 feet.
   But after viewing videotape of the ship, Hubbard said, ``It
didn't look as bad as it sounds.''
   ``There's water over the bow, but the propeller is in the
water,'' he said.
   The freighter, escorted by the tanker Chevron Colorado, was
making 6 knots through low swells, Hubbard said. A Coast Guard
cutter was to replace the tanker escort this morning.
   The Bulka's Athens-based owner, Bacolistas and Sons, sent two
tugs from Honolulu to rendezvous with the freighter by Monday and
tow it, Hubbard said.
   The Bulka had been headed for South Korea with a load of scrap
metal, said Barry Arrett, captain of the Colorado.

   A gas explosion at a power station named
Hellgate shot balls of flame hundreds of feet into the sky, blacked
out thousands of buildings and traffic lights and brought subways
to a halt.
   Two people were killed and 30 injured.
   ``It was like the `War of the Worlds,' everybody was
panicking,'' said Angel Rivera, 27, who rode a bus through Bronx
streets that were left without traffic signals Friday afternoon.
``It was a real scary sight.''
   An estimated 450,000 subway commuters joined the chaos on the
streets when trains were stopped because the signals went out.
   Electricity to the subway tracks was uninterrupted, and
conducters brought the trains slowly to the nearest station, where
transit workers guided commuters out of darkened stations with
flashlights.
   Power was blacked out for five hours to more than 130,000
customers in a two-square-mile area on Manhattan's Upper East Side
and in a three-square-mile area of the Bronx.
   While large parts of the city were unaffected, the Upper East
Side and the Bronx were clogged with huge traffic jams as the
blackout shut off traffic signals. By rush hour, traffic officers
were posted at many intersections.
   The power loss stopped subway service throughout the Bronx and
part of Manhattan for more than six hours, and delayed commuter
trains to neighboring Westchester County and Connecticut.
   A pillar of smoke was visible throughout the metropolitan area
from the fire at Consolidated Edison Co.'s Hellgate Station on the
East River in the Bronx.
   Authorities said a utility worker's backhoe ruptured a 26-inch
natural gas line, causing the explosion. Heat from the fire melted
the backhoe. About 50 cars also were destroyed.
   Outside the power plant, the body of Lou Seminerio, a mechanic
in his 50s, was found about 25 feet from the backhoe. It was
unclear if he was the one operating the machine, said utility
spokeswoman Laurie Hanson.
   A teen-age boy suffered a heart attack when he jumped into the
frigid East River to escape the flames, and he died Friday night,
said Capt. Jeffrey Armstrong of Emergency Medical Services. Six of
the 30 people who suffered injuries were seriously hurt, he said.
   The explosion left a crater 25 feet wide and 10 feet deep.
   ``We heard a roar, saw a ball of fire, and the building started
to shake,'' said Jay Escudero, 44, who was in a lunchroom at a
depot a quarter-mile away when the gas line ruptured.
   When he and other workers ran outside, ``You could feel the heat
where we were standing, three or four hundred yards away,''
Escudero said. ``It sounded like when thunder hits, but the roar,
instead of subsiding like with thunder, kept getting louder and
louder.''
   ``The roar sounded like Niagara Falls,'' said John Mulligan, a
fire department spokesman.
   Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer said the explosion
``unleashed all hell.''
   Hundreds of firefighters, some in fire boats, battled the blaze
in freezing weather.
   About an hour after the explosion, workers cut off the gas
feeding the fire by closing three valves on the gas main, utility
spokeswoman Pat Richardi said.
   ``When the valve was turned, the flames got smaller and smaller
and smiles got bigger and bigger,'' said Paul Laddomada, 41, who
works for the Department of Environmental Protection a half-mile
from plant.
   Hellgate Station is a former generating plant that controls
electrical service for parts of the Bronx and Manhattan, and is a
crossover point for gas and power lines, Richardi said. It is near
Hell Gate, a section of the East River known for its dangerous
currents.
   The fire spared the switching station itself, but the intense
heat ruined several power lines, causing the power outages.
   People flooded hardware stores in search of flashlights,
batteries and candles. When regular candles ran out, they bought
birthday candles. Some restaurants coped by lighting candles;
others closed.
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, about 20,000 people found
themselves groping in semi-darkness relieved only by emergency
lights, guards' flashlights and light from skylights. Most museum
visitors remained calm.
   ``We're troupers, we've certainly had our share of blackouts in
New York,'' said Marianne Ranick. ``And it's another story for the
end of 1989.''

   Workers, slowed by huge slabs of
concrete, today searched for more victims of Australia's most
destructive earthquake, and police said they believed there were
six bodies in the debris of one building.
   Ten people are known to have been killed in Thursday's quake,
and 142 were injured.
   Demolition crews today started bulldozing heavily damaged
buildings and 100 more army troops were dispatched to patrol
streets and prevent looting in Newcastle, a major industrial center
75 miles north of Sydney. Police said at least 50 buildings may
have to be torn down.
   The temblor measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and seismologists
called it unusually strong for Australia.
   Rescue efforts centered on the Newcastle Workers' Club, where
two floors collapsed onto a basement parking lot during the
earthquake.
   Police said the work was hampered today because the concrete
slabs that formed the floor were so heavy. A wall also threatened
to collpase.
   Police spokeswoman Jo Watts said the bodies workers expected to
recover were in this wreckage. However, workers did not expect to
reach the bodies until Sunday, she said.
   ``There are also nine cars in the basement but we've located and
contacted seven of the owners. Two, we couldn't get the numbers
of,'' she said.
   Ms. Watts said the 10 victims already identified were local
people.
   Emergency teams, which have been working non-stop since the
quake hit, had an especially tiring day.
   ``They started to remove sections of the wall where they believe
people are trapped. But it started to give way because of the time
spent trying to remove the heavy concrete slabs.''
   Initial estimates put the damage at $1 billion, and an official
of the Australian Insurance Industry Council said the damage could
run into ``hundreds of millions of dollars.''
   Australia's biggest earthquake was at Meeberrie, in remote
Western Australia in 1941 and measured 7.7 on the Richter scale, a
gauge of the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the
ground motion recorded on a seimograph.
   Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in
magnitude. A quake measuring 5 can cause considerable damage and
one measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

clients and then urged women to forgo abortions.
   Seven other supporters of the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue were arrested while demonstrating outside the Northside
Women's Clinic Friday, police said.
   The protesters entered the clinic with a group of clients,
police said. After everyone was seated, the men jumped up and began
arguing against abortion.
   Police advised clinic employees to check the day's client list,
and arrested those who didn't have appointments.
   Outside, other protesters sat in front of two clinic entrances.
A group sang and picketed in front of the clinic, briefly blocking
cars until the occupants rolled down their windows and accepted
anti-abortion literature. One man was arrested after he stood in
front of a car and refused to move.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said those arrested, 16 adults
and one 16-year-old girl, were charged with criminal trespass and
were held on $220 bond each at the DeKalb County Jail.
   Miller said he normally releases abortion protesters after
giving them a copy of the charges, but ``I feel like it's more
serious this time.''
   ``They were actually inside the building,'' he said. ``Something
bad is going to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if one day this
thing blew sky-high.''
   Friday's demonstration was the third time this month that
members of the group have been arrested in the Atlanta area and the
second time the Northside Clinic has been targeted.

<HEAD>General Assembly Says Panama Invasion Against International Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, China and Spain joined
most Latin American nations in condemning the U.S. invasion of
Panama and demanding a swift withdrawal of U.S. troops.
   On a vote of 75-20 with 40 abstentions, the General Assembly on
Friday passed a resolution that ``deeply deplores'' the Dec. 20
invasion and calls the action a ``flagrant violation'' of
international law.
   General Assembly resolutions are not binding and have no legal
force, but they carry moral weight as the will of the international
community.
   U.S. Ambassador M. James Wilkinson said before the vote that the
resolution was unbalanced. He said it failed to mention the alleged
drug trafficking crimes of ousted dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega
and his suppression of democracy.
   ``The United States has no interest in military presence in
Panama beyond our obligations under the Canal Treaties,'' Wilkinson
said. ``The forces recently deployed will withdraw as rapidly as
Panamanian forces can restore security. We are confident this will
take place in a short time.''
   He said the international community should recognize that ``the
freely expressed will of the Panamanian people has opted decisively
for the (President Guillermo) Endara government and rejected the
despotic drug trafficker, Manuel Noriega.''
   Endara was believed to be have won the Panamanian elections
earlier this year but the results were voided by Noriega, who is
holed up in the Vatican embassy in Panama.
   Later, Panamanian envoy Leon Abadi Abadi, who switched sides
from Noriega to Endara, denounced Noriega as a ``narco-terrorist
who placed his interest above those of the Panamanian people.'' The
career diplomat denounced ``the tyrant dictator who rejected the
democratic election of May 7.''
   Panama voted against the resolution, and Cuba denounced Abadi
for changing sides.
   Countries the sided with the United States and voted against the
resolution included Portugal, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Turkey.
   The assembly, meeting in emergency session at the request of
Cuba and Nicaragua, heard a dozen speakers over two days denounce
the U.S. action. Some called it an example of gunboat diplomacy.
   The government in Panama, meanwhile, apparently won a limited
victory in a battle over U.N. credentials. In a compromise between
the envoys representing the Noriega regime and the government of
President Guillermo Endara, the Panamanian deputy envoy, Abadi, was
allowed to speak after the vote.
   Although he switched sides, Abadi still holds credentials from
the Noriega government.
   Endara's choice for U.N. envoy, Eduardo Vallarino, is not yet
accredited to the world body.

   Two soldiers made ``a tragic mistake''
in causing an artillery accident that killed three soldiers and
wounded 24, but they won't be court-martialed, their commander said.
   Safety violations that caused the Sept. 27 accident were
insufficient reason to prosecute Sgt. Edward C. Tyler of
Washington, D.C., and Spec. Nickoles W. Holly of Canton, Ohio, Maj.
Gen. Raphael J. Hallada said Friday.
   Tyler and Holly were accused of dereliction of duty and
negligent homicide and faced up to 15 months confinement, loss of
wages and bad-conduct discharges if convicted on both charges.
   ``My decision that trial by court-martial is not the appropriate
course was based on the evidence, on the spotless records of Tyler
and Holly, and on my determination that the accident was a tragic
mistake resulting from a momentary violation of safety procedures
rather than a criminal act,'' said Hallada, commander at Fort Sill.
   Officers who investigated the accident at a rifle range in
southwest Oklahoma said one of five rounds fired from a 105mm
howitzer during a training session contained the wrong powder
charge.
   The round overshot its target and exploded behind a group of 80
soldiers lined up in formation to leave the range.
   Two of the injured soldiers remain hospitalized in serious
condition.
   Hallada said he met with Tyler and Holly and their commanding
officers in to review the actions that led to the accident.
   ``The two soldiers know that they caused the accident ... The
officers know that this happened on their watch,'' Hallada said.
``These were very emotional meetings. Every one of them would give
anything to have that round back.''
   Investigators said Holly, a cannoneer in the howitzer crew,
prepared the powder charges before the rounds were fired and was to
remove excess powder bags when a lesser charge was fired. He was to
display the bags to his section chief, Tyler.
   The investigators concluded that Holly failed to do this with
one of the five rounds and that Tyler didn't catch the error.
   But Hallada said, ``I was not convinced a jury would find that
Holly and Tyler blatantly disregarded what a reasonably careful
person would have done under the circumstances.''

   Forty ships steamed through the
Panama Canal on its second day of 24-hour operations as officials
speeded processing to reduce a lengthy backlog caused by the U.S.
invasion.
   ``We have 128 ships waiting in line,'' Franklin Castrejon,
spokesman for the Panama Canal Administration, said Friday.
``Normally there are only 15 to 20 ships standing by.''
   Up to 36 ships a day normally cross the 45-mile-long waterway
that links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Castrejon said.
   The canal was closed after U.S. forces invaded Panama on Dec. 20
to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. It resumed 24-hour operations
on Thursday.
   The new government of President Guillermo Endara is expected to
submit to U.S. authorities its candidate for the post of canal
administrator. A new administrator is to fill the post on Jan. 1.
   The United States appointed deputy administrator Fernando
Manfredo as interim administrator after the invasion.
   The 1977 Panama Canal Treaties call for the United States to
transfer control of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.

<HEAD>Dog Shot by Mailman to get $500 Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dog shot by a mailman will be buried in a
silk-lined casket at Post Office expense, but some neighbors are
saving their sympathy for the postman, who faces felony charges.
   Letter carrier Floyd Sterling, described by one resident as a
``sweet, wonderful man'' and ``gentle as a lamb,'' was charged
Friday with one count each of cruelty to animals, carrying a
concealed weapon and negligent discharge of a firearm.
   If convicted on all counts, Sterling, 34, could go to prison for
more than 5 years, said Deputy District Attorney Myron Jenkins.
   Meanwhile, Skippy, the deceased German shepherd mix, is
scheduled for a $500 memorial service and funeral at Los Angeles
Pet Memorial Park. Arrangments for the funeral Wednesday include a
silk-lined casket, large floral displays, a graveside ceremony and
a headstone, said Lara Ortega, spokeswoman for the memorial park.
   Skippy has some enemies in his suburban Arleta neighborhood.
   Neighbor Beth Adams, 30, the one who praised Sterling's
gentleness, said Skippy is notoriously vicious.
   Others feel Skippy's owner, Tammie Brody, 27, is taking
advantage of the Postal Service offer to pay for the dog's burial.
   ``When my son's dog died after he was hit by a car, we put him
in a box and buried him. And they couldn't have loved that dog
more,'' said neighbor Claire DeNunez. ``This is a little
ridiculous. This family is taking things too far and ... the
taxpayers are paying for it.''
   Sterling shot the dog Tuesday as Ms. Brody was opening the front
door to give the mailman a Christmas bottle of vodka. The letter
carrier said Skippy was menacing him and had bitten him in a
previous run-in.
   At the time of the shooting, Sterling was on probation for a
1988 misdemeanor conviction for carrying a loaded .44 magnum
revolver in his car, according to San Fernando Municipal Court
records.
   The postman was put on paid leave pending an internal
investigation of the incident, postal authorities said. Postal
regulations prohibit workers from carrying firearms on duty.

<TEXT>
   A Southwest winter storm that dumped nearly a foot of snow on
parts of central Arizona lingered today and snow mixed with
freezing rain and sleet glazed the Northeast from Lower Michigan to
Long Island.
   Snow advisories were in effect for central Arizona and winter
weather advisories were posted over much of New Mexico today.
   By mid-afternoon Friday, Arizona snowfall included 11 inches at
Flagstaff, 8 inches at Sunset Crater and Pinetop, and 7 inches at
Walnut Canyon.
   A snow advisory was posted for Southern California's San Gabriel
and San Bernardino mountains. Advisories for strong winds were
posted over the northern deserts and Owens Valley of Southern
California.
   In addition to Arizona, snow extended today from Washington
state through Montana and Wyoming to the Dakotas, south to Nebraska
and northern parts of Illinois and Iowa across much of Wisconisin
and Michigan to southern New England and New York state.
   In the Midwest today, a weak low-pressure trough in the central
Mississippi Valley was expected to drift northeast, bringing light
snow as cold air regrouped over Wisconsin.
   Upper-level winds were forecast to shift to the northwest
Sunday, allowing another surge of cold air to descend into the
Great Lakes region.
   A cold front over Indiana and Missouri will slide southeast
today, to be replaced by an upper disturbance from south-central
Canada.
   The front should spawn freezing drizzle and flurries over parts
of Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Nebraska, Pennsylvania,
southern New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and northern
Virginia.
   Colder air was expected to sock the nation's midsection today.
The cold, combined with the Canadian disturbance, should continue
the threat of light precipitation.
   By tonight and Sunday, northwest winds will push clouds and
flurries out of the Midwest.
   Friday was the 23rd day this month the temperature at
Pennsylvania's Williamsport-Lycoming Airport failed to rise above
32 degrees, setting a record for December cold in the area.
   Three California cities enjoyed record high temperatures Friday.
Oakland's 65 degrees, Sacramento's 72 and San Francisco's 68 melted
old marks.
   Friday's high temperature in the nation was 81 degrees at
Kingsville and McAllen, Tex.

<HEAD>Letter Claiming Mail-Bomb Responsibility Appears Authentic, FBI Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI believes a letter claiming responsibility
for bombings that killed a federal judge and a lawyer is authentic,
but agents still know nothing about the organization that sent it.
   The letter was sent to Atlanta television station WAGA and
disclosed Thursday.
   ``We believe the letter received by WAGA is authentic because it
contained information which has not been made known to the public
and which is known only to someone closely associated with the
construction and mailing of the bombs and to law enforcement,''
said William L. Hinshaw, special agent in charge of the FBI
investigation.
   The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, quoting unidentified
sources, reported Friday that the letter contained an identifying
code identical to that in follow-up letters sent to the bomb
targets. The newspaper didn't elaborate.
   NAACP Southeastern regional director Earl Shinhoster said a
letter sent to his office after a tear-gas bombing, postmarked Aug.
21, also contained that numerical code. He said other letters
associated with the bombings also have that code.
   ``They're all the same,'' he said. ``If you see one, you can
rest assured that if there's another one, it also has a code.''
   The letter to WAGA referred to the case of Julie Love, a white
Atlanta woman who was abducted in July 1988 and whose body was
found last summer. Two black men were arrested; one has pleaded
guilty to murder and other charges, and the other is awaiting trial.
   The letter said U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance and Savannah
lawyer Robert Robinson were ``assassinated'' in reprisal for Ms.
Love's death. It said ``two more prominent members of the NAACP''
also would be killed in reprisal.
   Vance was killed at his Alabama home on Dec. 16; Robinson was
killed in Savannah two days later.
   The letter said that any time a black man rapes a white woman in
Alabama, Florida or Georgia _ the states served by the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, on which Vance sat _ a federal judge, an
attorney and an officer of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored Persons would be killed.
   The FBI in Atlanta asked anyone with information on the group,
calling itself Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System,
to call a hotline established for tips in the case.
   Agency spokesman Diader Rosario said Friday that some calls had
been received since news of the group's letter broke Thursday. The
information received so far, however, was ``nothing exciting,''
Rosario said. He refused to provide details.
   ``Certainly it (the group) is something brand new for us, and
another link in the chain,'' Rosario said.
   The letter also condemned the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
for ``granting the blacks' demand for white teachers for their
children,'' leading FBI agents to re-interview the lead plaintiff
in a 21-year-old school-desegregation case.
   ``They showed me some of the letters that had been written, and
they asked me for names of people that I know who would send
letters like that,'' said the plaintiff, Roger Mills, who also is a
member of the DeKalb NAACP's executive committee.
   Mills said he would review his stockpile of hate mail to see
whether any of it is similar to the letter sent to WAGA.
   Benjamin Hooks, the NAACP's executive director, said the
threatening letter is intended to intimidate the group, ``to strike
fear in our hearts.''
   ``It will not succeed. We intend to go about our business, but
we will most certainly be taking precautions,'' Hooks said from the
NAACP national headquarters in Baltimore.

   Two sightseeing planes collided
off southern New Zealand today and one crashed in water, killing
seven people on board, according to news reports.
   The New Zealand Press Association said the dead included six
Japanese tourists and their New Zealand pilot.
   The agency, quoting a report on Televison New Zealand, said the
pilot of the other plane landed safely at Milford, on the southwest
corner of the South Island.
   It did not mention other passengers or give details of the
collision.
   ``The light aircraft operated by Air Fiordland crashed into the
deepest part of Milford Sound in the Stirling Falls area and is
irrecoverable at this stage,'' Constable Alan Christie of the
Queenstown Police was quoted as saying.
   He said the plane was lying in approximately 1,000 feet of
water. The press association said only two of the bodies had been
recovered.

<HEAD>Police Disclose Arrest Of 9-Year-Old Boy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police had tears in their eyes when they booked a
9-year-old boy who allegedly sold crack cocaine to an undercover
officer, an official said.
   The 3-foot-11, 95-pound youngster was arraigned Friday in
Roxbury District Court on juvenile delinquency charges. He was
released to the custody of his grandmother, with whom he has been
living because his mother is in prison, police said.
   The boy's name was not released.
   ``It was a very sad and traumatic thing to see a little
9-year-old boy sitting in the station arrested for drugs,'' Deputy
Superintendent Robert Hayden said. ``I saw some veteran officers
with tears in their eyes over this incident.''
   Among the youngest children arrested around the country on crack
charges have been a 10-year-old Detroit boy in August and a
10-year-old boy on Long Island in New York in January.
   Boston police said they sought an arrest warrant for the
teen-ager whom the 9-year-old identified as the supplier of the
crack.
   ``The little boy would go out and sell until the end of the
night when he would reach the older person who would give him
money'' for the sales work, Hayden said. The boy told police he had
been selling for about two weeks.
   The 9-year-old had $68 in his pockets, probably from drug sales,
when he was arrested Thursday night, police said.
   ``He was kind of scared,'' Hayden said. ``He was crying.''
   Police said they will ask to have the boy turned over to the
Department of Social Services. Charles Dickerson, a police juvenile
officer, said the youngster needs better supervision than he gets
from his grandmother.
   ``He's used to getting out there and staying with the older
kids,'' Dickerson said. ``He's been seen at 11 p.m. with older
kids.''
   Hayden said three undercover officers went Thursday night to a
corner in Boston's Roxbury section where there had been reports of
heavy drug activity. Hayden said one officer was approached by the
boy, who said, ``What's up?''
   ``What do you got?'' asked the officer.
   The boy reached into his pocket and handed the officer what is
believed to be crack, the highly addictive, form of cocaine. After
the arrest, officers found 80 small bags of crack near the
intersection.
   Hayden said, ``The feeling we were left with was, with all the
shootings and terrible things we see, this has affected us the most
because he is supposed to be innocent.
   ``He is supposed to be worried about what he got for Christmas.''

<TEXT>
   The Vatican today declared it did not intend
to ``block the course of justice'' by giving refuge to ousted
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, who is wanted in the United
States on drug trafficking charges.
   The Vatican Secretariat of State also said in a communique that
it was continuing to examine the case with U.S. authorities ``in a
spirit of serene collaboration'' in hopes of finding a
mutually-acceptable solution.
   It was the second day in a row that the Vatican issued
statements defending its actions in the Noriega case, but it was
the first official comment by the Secretariat of State, the Holy
See's highest administrative body.
   The Vatican has been under pressure by U.S. authorities to hand
over Noriega, who sought asylum in the Vatican Embassy in Panama
City on Christmas Eve after eluding thousands of American troops
who invaded Dec. 20.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Friday the Vatican could
not hand over Noriega to the Americans but was urging him to leave
the embassy on his own.
   Today's statement said the Vatican and U.S. authorities ``have
agreed to continue to remain in close contact to examine together,
in a spirit of serene collaboration, the various aspects of the
complex case and the possibility of arriving at a just solution
which will be mutually satisfactory.''
   The communique stressed that in giving refuge to Noriega the
papal nuncio in Panama ``did not intend to block the course of
justice regarding a person accused of serious crimes but to promote
the end of a conflict that ... could have gone on indefinitely in
the form of guerrilla warfare.''
   Navarro declined to comment on the state of the negotiations. He
said the Vatican still had not received a formal request from the
new Panamian government to hand over Noriega.
   Earlier, Navarro said the loud music played by U.S. troops
outside the Vatican Embassy in Panama was not helping talks on what
to do with Noriega.
   ``If this is going to continue, further steps will be taken'' by
the Vatican, Navarro said without elaborating.
   The rap and rock music, which has included numerous taunting
songs, seemed intended to torment Noriega.
   U.S. troops turned down the volume late Friday afternoon.

<HEAD>Indian Parliament Repeals Punjab Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has repealed a constitutional
amendment that allowed the government to suspend basic human rights
in Punjab state where Sikh extremists have killed more than 7,500
people in the past seven years.
   The decision, taken late Friday night in the final hours of the
first Parliament session convened under Prime Minister V.P. Singh,
was largely a goodwill gesture.
   The amendment, passed in March 1988 when Rajiv Gandhi was prime
minister, would have expired March 30, 1990. Many of the measures
imposed under it had already been lifted earlier by the Gandhi
government in hopes of easing the Punjab situation.
   Singh has promised to seek a political solution to the Punjab
problem and has already traveled to the rich northern farming state
in hope of opening new talks with Sikh militants.
   Sikh extremists, advocating creation of an independent nation
for their faith in Punjab, have killed at least 1,806 people in the
state this year, including 25 since Singh took office Dec. 2.
   The victims include Hindus, the country's largest religious
group, as well as fellow Sikhs considered traitors or
non-supportive of the militant movement.
   Parliament's lower house voted 360-1 to repeal the 59th
amendment to the Constitution, and the upper house cast a unanimous
140 votes in favor of repeal. The repeal will become effective as
soon as it is accepted by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, whose
post is primarily ceremonial.
   Gandhi, who is now the opposition leader in Parliament, said
earlier his Congress Party would not oppose repeal.
   The policy-making lower house, of which Singh and Gandhi are
members, had 525 seats at stake in the November election. Singh's
National Front and its allies have 277 seats, while the Congress
Party has 193.
   The 59th amendment had allowed the government to declare a state
of emergency in parts or all of Punjab, thereby enabling the
government to invoke other anti-terrorism laws that permit arrest
without charge and indefinite detention. These laws remain on the
books.
   Singh, who is a Hindu like all of his predecessors as prime
minister, led his National Front coalition through the November
election with pledges to seek a political solution to Punjab.
   Sikhs, who have a slight majority in Punjab, have complained of
discrimination against their faith and culture by Hindus.
   Nationally, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people, while Hindus account more about 80 percent.
   The Sikh faith has roots in both Hinduism and Islam.

   Hermann Julius Oberth, a pioneer
of the space age who worked with Wernher von Braun to help develop
Germany's V-2 rocket, died Friday after a short illness. He was 95.
   He began experiments on a conical jet motor for the German
government in 1930 and developed a model later that year. Oberth
worked on the motor with von Braun, who later became the leading
scientist in U.S. space flight development.
   He submitted a thesis on rocket experiments for his doctorate,
which was turned down as too cursory. An expanded version was
published in 1923 as the book, ``The Rockets to the Planets in
Space.''
   A third publication of the work in 1929, ``The Way to Spaceship
Travel,'' is today seen as a pioneering work in rocket research.

   Rebels in northern Ethiopia claimed today
that they killed or wounded 8,200 government soldiers and captured
2,220 more while overrunning the garrison town of Debre Tabor.
   The rebels announced the fall of the garrison in northwestern
Gonder Province earlier this week in addition to the capture of two
towns in Shoa Province to the south.
   The government has made no comment on the reported fighting, but
diplomats in the capital, Addis Ababa, say the rebel claims of
capturing the three communities appear to be true.
   Reporters have been denied access to the region, and the
reports, especially regarding casualties, cannot be independently
verified.
   In clandestine radio broadcasts earlier in the week, the rebels
of the Tigre People's Liberation Front put the government toll for
all three towns at nearly 3,000 killed, wounded or captured.
   But in a broadcast monitored in Nairobi today, the insurgents
claimed far higher government losses in Debre Tabor alone.
   None of the broadcasts heard through the week mentioned rebel
losses.
   If the rebel reports of government losses are true, the
seven-day battle for Debre Tabor would mark the biggest defeat in
more than a year for the forces of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The Tigrean rebels opened a new offensive in late August after a
six-month lull in their 14-year-old war to topple Mengistu's
government. They now control all of their home province of Tigre
and have made signigicant advances into Wollo, Gonder and Shoa
provinces to the south and west.
   Like the government, the Tigrean insurgents are Marxists. Their
leaders have spoken frequently and paradoxically of wanting a
democratic government patterned after that of Communist Albania.
   The government faces an even older insurgency in the
northernmost province of Eritrea, where rebels have been fighting a
seccessionist war for 28 years. However, there has been little
activity in that region in recent months.

   Two teen-agers were arrested and charged today
with the drive-by shootings of two women who police said were
innocent victims of a turf battle among drug dealers near a housing
project.
   Eric Reed, 17, and Dwayne Faust, 16, both of the borough of
Queens, were charged with murder, assault, weapons violations and
reckless endangerment, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police
spokeswoman.
   They were arrested at 2:10 a.m., nearly 24 hours after they were
arrested at the scene of an unrelated shooting, she said.
   Reed and Faust were accused of killing Lysa Biffle, who was 26
and nine months pregnant, and Ebony Williams, 18, who was planning
to attend college next fall, on Christmas night shortly before
midnight.
   Ms. Williams was shot twice in the head as she and a friend were
making a call at a pay phone in Queens.
   Mrs. Biffle and her husband, Dwayne, 25, were shot as they were
getting into their car after visiting a relative. She gave birth to
a healthy boy by Caesarean section before she died. Biffle was
treated for a foot wound.
   Police say the neighborhood where the shootings occurred has
attracted gangs who fire at innocent people to show other drug
dealers that they are moving into the area.
   Reed and Faust were also charged with the attempted murder of
18-year-old Douglas Moore, who was seriously injured in a shooting
Friday morning that apparently resulted from an argument in a
parking lot, Mohrmann said.

<TEXT>
   A nearly empty Northwest Airlines DC-10 took off
for Detroit today, despite a bomb threat that persuaded 105 people
to cancel their bookings, leaving just 42 people on board.
   The Paris to San Francisco flight, with change of planes in
Detroit, carried 14 crew members and 28 passengers, three of whom
were journalists making the trip to report on the threatened flight.
   A steady stream of passengers had changed their travel plans
after hearing news reports of threats against Flight 51 in
retaliation for the bombing convictions of two Palestinians.
Northwest offered to allow passengers to change to other flights or
airlines with no penalty.
   The plane left Charles de Gaulle airport at 2:45 p.m. (8:45 a.m.
EST), more than two hours late because of fog.
   Close scrutiny of every piece of hand luggage being put aboard
caused a brief initial delay, but then the plane was held up by fog
that was disrupting all flights at the airport and caused some
flights to be canceled.
   The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported today that Spanish
authorities had information that Moslem extremists planned to use
surface-to-air missiles to attack Arab and French passenger planes.
   The newspaper, quoting investigators in Madrid, said the
information was developed following last month's seizure of arms
caches apparently intended for terrorist attacks in Europe.
   Spanish police have refused to comment on similar reports in
Spanish newspapers, saying their inquiry is confidential. There was
no indication of a connection between the Saudi report and the
Northwest flight.
   Many passengers requested transfers to other flights when they
arrived at Northwest's check-in desk at mid-morning today.
   ``I would have been on pins and needles the whole way,'' said
Camille Major, 21, of Madison, Wis., who was headed home after
three weeks in Europe.
   ``Six hundred dollars isn't worth my life,'' she said. ``My
vacation was bad and this just tops it off.''
   The Hsia family of Foster City, Calif., near San Francisco,
arrived at the airport about 10 a.m. unaware of the bomb threat.
   The family of four held discussions about whether to change
airlines.
   ``My mom changed her mind three times, but we're going,'' said
17-year-old Eddie Hsia, baseball cap tipped back on his head. ``My
dad follows what my mom says.''
   Security at the airport was extremely tight, as armed officers
of the air and border police and riot police with leashed dogs
shepherded the passengers through scrupulous check-in procedures.
Each piece of luggage was X-rayed on freeze-frame video machines.
   Even a small souvenir bust of Napoleon was put on the belt and
X-rayed separately.
   The DC-10 can hold 284 passengers. Northwest originally had 130
seats booked, but cancellations started pouring in Friday after
news reports described the bomb threat against the plane.
   Northwest announced the threat Thursday, but said the FBI asked
that no details be disclosed.
   ABC News, quoting sources it did not identify, reported Thursday
night that a man with a ``Middle Eastern accent'' made the threat
to Northwest's Detroit office, saying the bombing would be in
retaliation for life sentences given two Palestinians convicted in
Sweden of charges connected with a string of bombings in Europe.
   One of the two, Abu Mohammed Talb, is a suspect in the December
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
   He and co-defendant Marten Imandi were sentenced to life for
their part in the 1985 bombing of a Northwest office in Copenhagen
that killed one person and wounded 20, one of four bombings in
Denmark and the Netherlands for which they were convicted.
   In Washington, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John
Leyden said officials were ``working with Northwest and with the
French authorities to ensure there is extra security on the
flight.''
   Pierre Quilici, deputy chief of France's Air and Border Police,
said U.S. authorities had passed on word of the threat several days
ago. He said he could not disclose any special security measures
planned to protect the flight.
   Airline spokesman Robert Gibbons said Northwest originally
agreed to a request by security agencies not to make the threat
public. But then a report of the threat came out of Europe.
   The FAA has a policy of not alerting the public to security
threats unless they are very specific and the flight involved is
not being canceled. The Northwest threat appeared to meet
conditions that would allow disclosure.

<HEAD>Parliament Changes Poland's Name, Drops Communists' Leading Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today restored Poland's
historic name that had been changed by the Communists 45 years ago,
and amended the constitution to drop the leading role of the
Communist Party in state affairs.
   Senators rose and sang ``God Who Watches Over Poland'' and the
national anthem after voting 79-0 with two abstentions to make the
constitutional changes.
   Parliament's lower house, the Sejm, had approved the changes
Friday by a vote of 374-1 with 11 abstentions. Senate approval is
needed for measures to become law.
   The Senate vote confirmed restoration of the Republic of Poland
as the country's official name from the People's Republic of Poland
imposed when the Communist Party took power in 1944.
   On Friday, the Senate approved 11 economic laws passed on two
previous days by the Sejm which were backed by the Solidarity-led
government and aim to create a market-economy and reduce inflation.
   The amendments restore democratic language and traditions,
changing a phrase that called Poland a ``socialist society'' to a
``citizens' society.''
   The Senate also favored the Sejm decision to restore the crown
that symbolizes Polish sovereignty and unity that graced the head
of the eagle on the national emblem until the Communist takeover.
   After the Senate vote, an eagle with a crown brought two weeks
earlier by an unknown farmer was hung in the Senate hall.
   The farmer, who name was not noted when he made the gift to the
Senate's Human Rights Commission, said the eagle was the only
souvenir he had of his father.
   The amendments give citizens the right to create political
parties. Until now, the Communist Party, the Democratic Party and
the Peasant Party were the only legally recognized parties.
   The ammended constitution now guarantees protection of private
property.
   The amendments eliminate or modify articles which are
inconsistent with democratic reform until a new constitution can be
written.
   The critical pieces of legislation include two key laws on
unemployment designed to protect workers. The government estimates
that as many as 400,000 people could become unemployed as a result
of the radical economic program.
   The other new laws regulate activities of the National Bank,
credit policy, joint ventures, foreign capital, hard currency,
customs, and taxation.
   The hard currency law aims to create internal convertibility of
the zloty which means Poles eventually will be able to use zlotys
in hard currency stores that now exist throughout Poland.
   Another goal of the law is to make the zloty a convertible
currency on the world market, but first the official rate of the
zloty must converge with an unofficial legal rate. Finance ministry
officials say this must happen gradually.
   On Wednesday, Parliament passed a law regulating financing of
state enterprises and one limiting the growth of wages, a measure
designed to hold down inflation now running at 900 percent.

   Twelve people were killed and 12
injured when an apartment building collapsed under the weight of
three stories that were added to the structure illegally, police
said today.
   Rescue workers ended their search early today after pulling the
last four bodies from the rubble, police said.
   The building, which collapsed late Friday night, was inspected
recently after cracks appeared in some of its walls, residents
said. The government architect who examined the cracks did not
condemn the building, they said.
   The six-story building, located in the middle-class residential
district of Glim, originally had three stories, police said. But
they said its owners added another three stories without obtaining
building permits.
   ``The foundations of the house, designed to support only three
stories, apparently could not withstand the weight of another
three,'' said a police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was not known when the three additional floors were added.
   The fatalities included a family of four related to the
landlord, two 2-year-old children, a man and his wife, two women
and two Jordanian students.
   Police said people living in six of the apartment house's 10
units were traveling at the time of the collapse.

<HEAD>Oliver North is Upstaged in Musical Stage Debut</HEAD>

   Wearing a tuxedo with a floppy bow tie, Oliver
L. North tackled ``Peter and the Wolf'' with the same gritty,
square-jawed bravado that he mustered when he confronted his
Iran-Contra inquisitors in a bemedaled Marine uniform.
   This time, there was no quavering voice, no misty-eyed evocation
of God, country and duty. Instead, North gave a lively,
well-rehearsed narration of Sergei Prokofiev's classic musical tale
for children, embroidered with nasty growls and reassuring smiles.
   The audience of 1,000 Ollie oglers and music lovers _ including
North's probation officer _ greeted his musical stage debut in the
Capital Hilton Hotel ballroom Friday night with cheers, applause
and flashing cameras.
   He won the grownups, but he lost the kids. They sat on the front
row squealing and shrieking at the costumed animals.
   Oliver North, convicted felon in the Iran-Contra affair, was
upstaged by the big, bad wolf.
   ``It was right nice,'' said Aquil Robinson, 12. ``What I liked
best was when the wolf ate the duck.''
   ``Yeah, man,'' agreed his 6-year-old brother, Yusuf.
   North clearly enjoyed his half-hour performance with a 46-piece
orchestra and dancers from the American Contemporary Ballet, the
highlight of a holiday concert sponsored by the Beethoven Society,
a local musical group.
   The retired Marine colonel and former White House national
security aide, who is appealing his May 4 conviction on three
felony charges, appeared onstage as a favor to Maria Fisher, an
85-year-old cultural doyenne of Washington who is founder and
president of the Beethoven Society.
   Even though North reportedly charges $25,000 for every speech he
makes, Mrs. Fisher said he performed Friday night for free.
   Mrs. Fisher said she admired North when she watched his
nationally televised testimony at the congressional Iran-Contra
hearings in 1987. They became friends when they met later at a ball
at the Organization of American States, she said.
   About three months ago, she got the idea of introducing
classical music to inner-city children, and North accepted her
invitation to narrate ``Peter and the Wolf.''
   ``When the word got out, people called me and said, `How dare
you? Shame on you. He's a criminal.' But it takes all sorts to make
a world, doesn't it? Besides, he's a good friend of mine,'' she
said.
   In a pre-concert interview, Mrs. Fisher said: ``I don't know
about his talents as a narrator, but I know he's got a good
speaking voice. I watched those hearings and I'm sure he can read a
script.''
   North said it was his first stage appearance since he performed
in a high school production of ``How the West Was Won'' in his
hometown of Philmont, N.Y., nearly 30 years ago.
   ``I think I was the bad guy,'' he said.
   The audience Friday night included North's probation officer,
Ralph Ardito, and 100 youngsters from Save Our Youth, a private,
non-profit anti-drug program for inner-city children where North is
carrying out his sentence of 1,200 hours of community service.
   He also was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $150,000
after his conviction of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, shredding government documents and accepting an illegal
gratuity.
   Ardito said North's stage appearance will not reduce his
required hours of community service, even though children from Save
Our Youth were in the audience.
   Conductor Richard Weilenmann praised North for a ``very good''
performance with nary a missed cue.
   ``Some narrators are exaggerated and overblown, but he read very
naturally, as if he were reading to his own children,'' Weilenmann
said.
   Another enthusiast in the audience was Robert W. Owen, who
formerly was North's liaison with Nicaraguan Contra rebels during
the clandestine attempt to channel military aid to the
anti-Sandinista forces.
   ``It was wonderful,'' said Owen, who brought his 2-year-old
daughter Katie. ``Ollie may have a new profession.''

<DATELINE>QUARRY HEIGHTS, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a statement
the U.S. Southern Command issued Saturday concerning an incident
involving the Nicaraguan ambassador to Panama:
   With good cause U.S. soldiers entered and searched what is now
claimed to be the alleged home of the Nicaraguan ambassador to
Panama in the El Dorado section of Panama City around 6 p.m. last
night.
   Acting on reliable information from a Panamanian citizen that
the house contained a large arms cache, soldiers from the JTF-South
(Joint Task Force-South) moved to the location and surrounded it.
Occupants of the house were notified by loudspeaker to evacuate the
building.
   After the request was ignored, warning shots were fired into the
air. At this point a man identifying himself as the Nicaraguan
ambassador, Mr. Antenor Ferrey, drove up. He stated tht the
building was his quarters and had diplomatic immunity.
   When asked for credentials, the man provided a blue identity
card, indicating that he had left his red diplomatic identity card
at the embassy. The unit continued to secure the area and requested
guidance from higher headquarters.
   Information provided by the American Embassy indicated that the
residence of the Nicaraguan ambassador was located in a high-rise
apartment building, Edificio Villa Magna, at Punta Paitilla rather
than the building surrounded by U.S. forces.
   Based on this information that the house was not covered by
diplomatic immunity, the commander on the scene informed Mr. Ferrey
he had received authorization to search the house and intended to
do so.
   Mr. Ferrey instructed the occupants, four men and three women,
to come out of the house. Mr. Ferrey also stated that there were a
few weapons in the house. Asked if these men were his personal
security force, Mr. Ferrey responded that they were members of his
family. The commander of U.S. forces at he scene was directed to
confiscate all weapons.
   At 7:10 p.m. all individuals and confiscated weapons were
released and U.S. forces left the premises.
   There was no damage to the house or injury to the occupants. It
should be pointed out that the weapons and munitions found were in
fact an arsenal far in excess of `a few' weapons we were told were
in the house.
   It is obvious that Mr. Ferrey was less than candid with us
regarding the quantity of weapons present.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle says he's not just a
``potted plant'' in the Bush administration and that he now knows
``what it takes'' to be president.
   Quayle also says he thinks he had a ``fairly easy'' first year
as vice president because of low expectations that followed the
media hazing he got when George Bush picked him as a running mate
last year.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Quayle said he
expects the coming year to be more challenging. He likened himself
to a high jumper and said that this year ``the bar will be
elevated.''
   The vice president described his principal achievements so far
as ``establishing myself in this office, establishing the loyal
relationship I have with the president, being a team player that
makes a contribution to the president.''
   Despite sniping from some administration officials who privately
dismiss him as irrelevant, Quayle insists he is a contributor to
policy deliberations.
   ``I spend a great deal of time with the president,'' Quayle
said. ``We have a very close, personal, loyal relationship. I'm
not, as they say, a potted plant in these meetings.''
   His self-assessment is not shared by everyone in the White
House. One top administration official called Quayle's
contributions to policy making ``marginal.'' The official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said Quayle ``rarely says anything''
during group meetings with Bush advisers. When he does, he can be
counted on to espouse the conservative line, officials say.
   Conversely, many others in the administration say the vice
president has acquitted himself well. Despite occasional
malapropisms, he has not fulfilled critics' predictions that he
would stumble and embarrass the administration with major gaffes.
   He meets with Bush daily, sits in on intelligence briefings and
frequently attends meetings Bush has with world leaders or domestic
groups. He is chairman of the president's Space Council and the
Competitiveness Council focusing on ways to spur business growth.
   He takes his cue from Bush, who as vice president never revealed
his advice to then-President Reagan, declining to disclose his
conversations with the president.
   He generally hews word-for-word to the administration line. But
on occasion, Quayle's conservatism has surfaced with a more
hard-line tone than Bush's statements, particularly regarding the
Soviets.
   Most recently, Quayle took a tough view of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, saying the United States should not let
Gorbachev's ``magnetic personality'' obscure true Soviet intentions.
   Quayle's remarks came just after Bush's Dec. 2 summit meeting
with the Soviet leader where U.S. officials stressed themes of
trust and cooperation.
   Quayle discounted the notion he has been instructed to placate
conservatives leery of Bush, or that he differs with Bush policy.
   ``It's the age-old game that is played in trying to find some
distinction between the president and vice president,'' he said.
   Asked why he has been more outspoken than Bush was as vice
president, Quayle said that while he patterns his vice presidency
after ``the George Bush model ... there is emerging the Dan Quayle
model.''
   Quayle said that today, he would probably give about the same
answer as he did in a major campaign debate last year if asked what
he would do if he were propelled into the Oval Office by the death
of the president.
   At that time, he said he would pray for himself and the country
and then call a meeting of Cabinet members and top presidential
advisers.
   ``I've been on this job approaching a year now. I know what to
do now if that tragic event should occur. Looking back, I'm not
sure the answer would be much different. ... I know what the
president does on a day-to-day basis, how he goes about the job.
I'm there. I'm present. He's always told me ... one of the
important roles of the vice president, any vice president, is to be
prepared.''
   ``Believe me I know what to do.''
   Quayle had a chance to perform under fire during the recent coup
attempt in the Philippines that occurred when Bush and his top
advisers were on their way to the Mediterranean superpower summit.
   He conducted an all-night meeting of National Security Council
principals, monitored events and kept a flow of information going
while Bush dispatched U.S. fighter planes to back up embattled
Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   Quayle didn't get much publicity for his role, but he said,
``there was a job and I did it. ... It's just not something that
you talk about.''
   Still, Quayle continues to languish in public opinion surveys
and suffers a steady stream of comedians' jokes maligning his
intelligence.
   ``I don't worry about it,'' he said.

   The teen-age revolutionary guard found
no guns in the reporters' rented Ford, but there were those six
suspect Bulgarian apples in the trunk. To make sure they weren't
bombs, he placed one on the ground and stomped it into applesauce.
   At another roadblock farther down, a man with a menacing
mustache and a murderous mien peered at a reporter's U.S. passport
and frisked him. Finding him harmless, the guard seized the
reporter's shoulders and, overcome with the day's emotion, planted
moist kisses on each of his cheeks.
   The uprising against Nicolae Ceausescu was not your
run-of-the-mill revolution.
   On the first evening of upheaval, the American reporter found a
mild-mannered hospital worker who had had enough of dictatorship.
``I'll help you,'' he said, ``but first I must drop this off.'' He
indicated a large yellow sports bag. ``It's full of Molotov
cocktails.''
   But for the chilling omnipresent mayhem, it was less a
revolution than spontaneous free-form theater of the absurd. And
everyone wanted a role.
   Checkpoints blossomed at subway stops, street corners and
doorways. On boulevards downtown, they were three to a block.
Sometimes soldiers manned them, but not usually.
   At one, a 9-year-old blond boy examined a reporter's papers,
nodding gravely. He was armed with a short stick better suited to
jabbing toads on a summer afternoon.
   At another, six scowling teen-agers circled a car and aimed
AK-47 assault rifles at the passengers. From their awkward, nervous
gestures, it seemed doubtful any of them knew a safety catch from a
trigger.
   In firefights, the dictator's die-hard killers held off
ill-trained soldiers and amateur revolutionaries, often amid a
tragicomedy of errors.
   During a night-long siege of the television station, a woman
popped regularly from the elevators to assure all occupants that
things were under control. Once, however, she emerged shrieking
hysterically. Defending soldiers were in a fierce gunbattle with
their own men across the road.
   Near the television, which was simultaneously the heart of the
revolution and the seat of its provisional government, paranoia ran
wild.
   Racing against a deadline, a carload of journalists stopped for
a thorough search. Guards poked into the car battery and examined
coins in pockets. From a short distance, guards at a second
roadblock watched, weapons ready. Finally cleared, the car rolled
on, only to be searched again by the second group.
   The paranoia was murderous. Late one night, CBS crews outside
the television station watched army guards open fire on a lone
pedestrian walking toward them in the dark. Over the deadly rattle,
his last words were hardly audible: ``Don't shoot. I'm a doctor.''
   CBS correspondents Martha Teichner and Bob Simon saw the scene
because sentries held them at gunpoint against a tank from 11:15
p.m. to 6 a.m. Finally, they resorted to playing on the old
Latino-Balkan machismo.
   Simon told them that Teichner was getting sick.
   ``The minute the words `sick' and `woman' got together,
everything changed,'' Teichner said. ``They took us inside, laid
blankets over me and found some candy. Suddenly the same guys who
were trying to kill us were giving us these little sweets.''
   Throughout the revolution, the leitmotif was an unceasing string
of communiques and serious talk from television, immediately
renamed Television Free Romania.
   At the most dramatic moments, the screen showed Ceausescu and
his wife, Elena, bundled out of an armored personnel carrier and
put on trial. Finally, they were shown shot against a wall, and
their bullet-torn bodies were pictured close-up.
   Mostly, it was discussion. From time to time, the talking heads
were replaced by snatches of opera, Christmas carols or an
occasional Tom &amp; Jerry cartoon. As doctors sewed up wounds and
commandos routed out terrorist snipers, Snow White's dwarfs sang,
``Whistle While You Work.''
   But on Thursday night, Romanian television ran its first
full-length Western feature film in some time, and people gazed at
their screens in rapt attention, sometimes solemnly.
   It was Charlie Chaplin's ``The Great Dictator.''

   This Horn of Africa nation, one of the
poorest in the world, is not a great place for tourists. Especially
those with cameras.
   Take a snapshot on a Mogadishu street and there's a good chance
your camera and film will be confiscated by police.
   It is all part of the elaborate security system established by
President Mohammed Siad Barre in his 20 years of authoritarian rule.
   An Associated Press reporter who recently interviewed the
president inside his walled, heavily guarded compound in Mogadishu
asked aides if he could be accompanied by a local photographer.
   ``Well, it's all highly complicated,'' said one. ``We'd have to
get clearance from the Board of Censors and that could take some
time. Maybe we can get the presidential press unit to take a
picture.''
   The presidential press unit didn't, although it taped the
interview on a high-quality, reel-to-reel recording machine,
apparently to be sure the quotes were accurate.
   At another interview with a lesser government official, an
unidentified man seated himself next to the reporter, took notes
and disputed the journalist's use of certain words in framing his
questions.
   He was from state security, the reporter was told later. Seems
the official being interviewed had spoken too frankly to a West
German television crew a few months earlier and was now being
monitored.
   A visiting Yugoslav journalist, Rosa Grce of the Zagreb
newspaper Vjesnik, complained to an Information Ministry official
that she couldn't even find postcards depicting Mogadishu scenes.
   ``All I find are pictures that could have been taken anywhere in
Africa,'' she said.
   ``This is Africa,'' said the official.

   The lights are going out in President
Mohammed Siad Barre's dingy, crumbling capital.
   After 20 years of often ruthless rule, the aging Siad Barre, who
is believed to be in his 80s, is isolated internationally and beset
by strife in his country.
   His power, most foreign observers agree, now extends no more
than 140 miles outside this seaside city, built three centuries ago
by an Arab ruler.
   ``Beyond that, it's a no man's land of war and banditry,'' says
one Western diplomat.
   But one foreign diplomat notes that those who oppose Siad Barre
may well have trouble agreeing on anything beyond their opposition
to him. The diplomat said there is no obvious person with the clout
or charisma to replace Siad Barre and lead the nation to a more
stable future.
   Strategically located at the tip of the Horn of Africa on the
eastern approach to the Red Sea, Somalia used to be wooed by both
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   But the Soviet Union abandoned Somalia in favor of rival
Ethiopia in their 1977 war over the Ogaden, long a disputed
territory on their central border.
   Now the United States, which happily picked up Siad Barre as a
client when Moscow dropped him, has tired of his human rights
abuses and stricken him from its list of friends.
   Washington has withheld or canceled more than $50 million in aid
dating back to 1987. Britain, France and other Western donors also
have slashed funds.
   Their growing unhappiness reached a peak in July when Siad
Barre's personal bodyguards, marked by their red-fringed berets,
crushed protests in the capital. According to diplomats, the guards
then rounded up 47 civilians, took them to a nearby beach, killed
them and buried the bodies in the sand.
   That came little more than a week after the United States
dedicated a new, $35 million embassy, the largest in sub-Sahara
Africa with a compound that boasts three swimming pools and a
nine-hole golf course.
   By the end of 1990, plans call for slashing the embassy staff of
about 430 in half, reflecting the sharp reductions in aid and the
number of people needed to administer it.
   Tribal rebellions in the north and south of the nation and clan
warfare in the center have sapped Somalia's treasury and helped
produce a sharp drop in export earnings. Never large to begin with,
they have fallen from about $100 million in 1986 to an estimated
$60 million in 1989.
   All of this has left Siad Barre with a bankrupt economy, an
annual inflation rate of 120 percent, an unpayable foreign debt of
$2 billion and a growing chorus of discontent that reaches even
into many government offices.
   Many of those offices barely function, the bureaucrats who man
them forced to find other sources of money on the outside or to
sell government services and favors to supplement their meager
incomes.
   Siad Barre has tried to defuse the growing opposition to his
regime by appointing a commission to rewrite the constitution to
permit multiparty elections late in 1990, a step his critics say is
too little too late.
   He also has offered to enter into unconditional peace talks with
his armed opponents, especially the Somali National Movement which
has routed government forces in much of the north of the country.
He had no takers.
   ``The opposition sees the government as crumbling. That's why
they're probably in no hurry to talk,'' said another diplomat, who,
like the first, spoke on condition he not be identified.
   Siad Barre faces another, smaller insurgency in southern Somalia
that surfaced only early this year. It has been largely stalled in
recent months by a rainy season that ends in January, when renewed
fighting is widely expected.
   The southern group, known as the Somali Patriotic Movement, has
spoken of a possible alliance with the northern insurgents, who
have been fighting off and on since 1981, but there is no evidence
of unity between them.
   In Mogadishu, where robberies and burlaries are soaring as the
desperately poor take to crime to meet their needs, public services
are virtually non-existent and many neighborhoods are almost always
without electricity because, it is said, the diesel fuel needed to
run the city's only power generator is siphoned off and sold by
government employees.
   Siad Barre, whose exact age is unknown but is thought to be in
the 80s, bemoans the loss of Western aid and denies the
well-documented human rights abuses that led to its reduction.
   ``It's no good to abandon your friends in a time of need,'' he
said in an interview in a luxuriously furnished conference room in
one of the many buildings that dot the large, walled compound in
which he lives and works.
   On the question of human rights abuses, he replied: ``It is
baseless. What's the use of arguing about it? It is being used as a
means to reach a certain goal. We do not believe it is fair.''

<HEAD>`Human Chain' Almost Surrounds City, Police Charge Twice</HEAD>

   Police and border troops used nightsticks and
fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons to disperse some
of the thousands of people demonstrating for peace in Jerusalem's
Old City today.
   At least 13 people were injured. Police arrested 50 people,
according to Israel radio.
   Police said some demonstrators shouted pro-Palestinian slogans,
setting off two charges by policemen into largely Palestinian
groups. Some demonstrators shouted ``Palestine is Arab!'' and the
Moslem rallying cry ``Allahu Akbar'' _ ``God is great!''
   For the most part, however, the Israeli, European and
Palestinian participants in the peace chain joined in chants of
``We want peace'' and carried balloons with the rally's slogan,
``1990 _ Time for Peace.''
   Some 15,000 people, about a third more than organizers had
expected, turned out for the ``human chain'' around the stone walls
of Jerusalem's Old City. Twelve hundred people came from Europe for
the rally, most of them Italians.
   The crowd probably could have encircled the wall of the Old
City, a distance of more than 4,000 yards. But participants were
unevenly distributed, with the activists five deep in some areas
and up to a dozen yards apart in others.
   After the activists linked hands, thousands of balloons were
released into the air to drift over the city.
   People stood silently for about 15 minutes, then some
participants broke into a rousing version of ``We Shall Overcome''
and chanted ``two states for two people.''
   Rally organizers said the goal was to prove that dialogue
between Israelis and Palestinians can lead to peace in the Middle
East. The rally was sponsored by Italian peace groups, Israel's
Peace Now and Palestinian activists.
   Faisal Husseini, a Palestinian leader in Jerusalem, complained
that army roadblocks on the outskirts of Jerusalem kept many
Palestinian from attending.
   ``I know that if the road were opened, we would have had double
or triple the number you are seeing,'' Husseini told reporters as
he joined the gathering.
   He described it as ``a very historic moment'' and added that it
should be a message for Israelis to look at the Palestinian as an
individual and ``learn that you can build peace with him.''
   A woman's peace march on Friday, also part of the ``1990 _ Time
for Peace'' program, was broken up by police firing tear gas and
swinging nightsticks after an outlawed Palestinian flag was raised.

   The following is the text of a statement
issued Saturday at the Vatican regarding former Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega. The statement was translated from Italian by The
Associated Press.
   Regarding the case of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who took
refuge in recent days in the apostolic nunciature of Panama, the
Secretariat of State declares:
   In the course of the consultations that have taken place in
recent days between the Holy See and U.S. authorities over the case
of Gen. Noriega, the two parties have agreed to continue to remain
in close contact to examine together, in a spirit of serene
collaboration, the various aspects of the complex case and the
possibility of arriving at a just solution which will be mutually
satisfactory, keeping in mind that, in receiving Mr. Noriega in the
apostolic nunciature, the apostolic nuncio did not intend to block
the course of justice regarding a person accused of serious crimes,
but to promote the end of a conflict that in previous days had
caused so much destruction and so many victims, and could have gone
on indefinitely in the form of guerrilla warfare.''

<DATELINE>COLON, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A babble of voices rose from the filthy
streets as hands dipped into crushed cartons of cigarettes and
shoes, bags of bras. Golden bracelets dangled from eager fingers,
on display for shoppers in the impromptu looters' market.
   ``One dollar! One dollar!'' a man cried, flicking his wrist at a
pile of pastel polo shirts.
   Four thieves surrounded a shopper. A knife glittered. A wallet
vanished into the hands of a skinny boy who ran and dodged like an
all-star wide receiver.
   A U.S. soldier rounded the corner. ``He was robbed! He was
robbed!'' excited voices cried, gesturing at the victim. The
soldier listened to the tale and shrugged.
   ``It's returning to normal,'' he said.
   The slums of Colon are glutted, sated with booty from the
frenzied looting sparked by the U.S. invasion of Panama on Dec. 20.
   ``People don't want any more TVs. They don't want any more
Betamaxes. Now they want money,'' said the new provincial governor,
Leopoldo Benedetti.
   Reality is beginning to dawn. You can't eat televisions; stereos
are indigestible. Colon is in shambles.
   ``There is going to be unemployment. And when you have hunger,
you have social unrest. Life could become unbearable,'' said
Alfonso Esquivel, the Colombian consul and one of the city's senior
diplomats.
   While U.S. troops ringed Colon last week, looters gutted its
shops and stores and cracked open the warehouses and dockside
terminal where goods from the Colon Free Zone, the world's
second-largest duty free port, are stored.
   Colon is an occupied city that put out the welcome mat. Its
merchants begged U.S. troops to enter to save their city from
chaos, and the city's new leaders are in no hurry for the
occupation to end.
   They need help picking up the debris from the fall of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's dictatorship.
   ``They have a moral obligation to help us get back to normal,''
said businessman Rafael Arosemena, vice chairman of the joint
council set up to get Colon back on its feet.
   This rough-and-tumble port city on the Atlantic end of the
Panama Canal unraveled with the sudden intensity of a tropical
storm.
   The U.S. troops landed, attacked several Defense Forces
installations and sealed off the city in the predawn hours of
Wednesday, Dec. 20.
   When dawn broke, Colon was a city without law. Noriega's Defense
Forces, which includes the local police, had fled, flinging open
the jailhouse doors as they went.
   The looting cut across class barriers in this city of about
60,000, known for some of the meanest slums and most predatory
street thieves in Latin America.
   ``I saw a doctor I know drive by with his BMW stuffed with
loot,'' Esquivel said.
   The rampage lasted two days.
   ``They were coming in by the hundreds,'' Bruce Motta Jr., whose
family trades watches and whiskey in the Free Zone, said as he
surveyed the debris-littered streets of the zone's auxiliary
warehouse area at France Field.
   ``They were running with televisions. They were running toward
the jungle. But they wouldn't put those televisions down,'' he said.
   In the main part of the Free Zone, about 150 plucky Arab traders
and their sons fought off looters for days, killing at least three
people and wounding several more.
   ``My luck was I had guys who knew how to use guns from the
invasion of Lebanon,'' one prominent merchant said, asking that his
name not be used.
   By the time U.S. forces entered the Free Zone on the afternoon
of Dec. 22, the looting was almost over and Colon was a wreck.
   Benedetti and several Defense Forces officers who had been
trying to fend off looters began gathering up arms from the
townspeople and the Defense Forces troops in hiding. Within two
hours, they had arranged a surrender, delivering several truckloads
of arms.
   The commander of the U.S. forces, Col. John Brooks, and his
staff took one look around and realized they had to change gears.
Within hours, they had come up with Project Cooperation, a plan for
the rebirth of Colon.
   The occupation force began arranging relief supplies, medical
care, health and sanitation services. They set up a joint council
with the officials President Guillermo Endara appointed to replace
the old Noriega regime.
   ``They're super people. They are very self reliant,'' Brooks
said of Colon's new leaders. ``The thing they want is security.''
   Within a week, more than 300 of the former Defense Forces
personnel had been signed up for a new security force. About a 100
were put on active, but unarmed duty, and began joint patrols with
U.S. troops.
   Details of the corruption that flourished under Noriega began
shaking loose as the dictator's allies rushed to align themselves
with the new order.
   The manager of a trading company that served as a slush fund for
Noriega turned himself in, professing his eagerness to cooperate
with the new government.
   As a semblance of order returned, Colon woke up like a drunk
after a binge. Benedetti and others began to realize how profound
the damage has been.
   Crucial government offices like customs houses had been
destroyed, normal commerce had come to a halt, merchants were faced
with huge, uninsured losses, the port was shut down, banks were
closed.
   The prospects for even deeper poverty and unemployment were grim.
   ``Colon is a city with too many problems,'' Benedetti said.
``There are 60,000 people; 40,000 of them have problems.''

   From Harvard to the Hard Rock Cafe to Hollywood,
people concerned about highway carnage on New Year's are promoting
the designated driver. Researchers say the idea is catching on, but
habits do not change easily.
   ``We are helping reduce the number of highly intoxicated drivers
on the road,'' said Micky Sadoff, national president of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving. ``But we're not going out of business,
sadly.''
   Using 1988 figures, federal officials at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta estimate that by the end of the holiday period
stretching from Dec. 21 to Jan. 2, 885 people will have died in
alcohol-related crashes.
   On New Year's Day, the researchers calculated, 58 percent of
traffic deaths involved drinking, compared with 39 percent
year-round.
   One death described by police as alcohol-related did get wide
attention last week: that of New York Yankees' famed player and
five-time manager Billy Martin, who died at 61 in a Christmas Day
crash near his home in upstate New York while riding in a pickup
truck driven by a friend. But in most cases, the public takes
little note of such deaths, experts say.
   ``We've become accustomed to a large background level of
carnage,'' said Terence Chorba, an epidemiologist who wrote the CDC
report.
   Chorba noted that the number of alcohol-related traffic deaths
in the holiday season are the equivalent of several airliners
crashing.
   But in traffic fatalities, ``one person dies here, one there,''
he said. ``It isn't perceived by the public to have the same type
of epidemic proportions.''
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that
traffic fatalities related to alcohol have declined the past
several years, both in actual numbers and as a percentage of total
highway deaths.
   Last year, an estimated 18,502 people were killed in
alcohol-related crashes, or just under 40 percent of all traffic
deaths. In 1982, 20,360 people died in alcohol-related crashes, or
46 percent of all highway deaths.
   To further the shift in drivers' habits, the Harvard School of
Public Health has focused its efforts the past couple of years to
promote designated driver programs around the country.
   For example, Harvard has persuaded television networks and
Hollywood studios to use dialogue in which characters who have been
drinking let someone else do the driving.
   ``Cheers'' and ``Family Ties'' were among the popular television
shows depicting designated drivers last season, including Alex
Keaton, the brash young ``Family Ties'' character played by Michael
J. Fox. ``Growing Pains'' scriptwriters had a character seriously
injured in an alcohol-related accident.
   At the beginning of last year's television season in September
1988, a Gallup poll conducted for Harvard found that 62 percent of
respondents said they regularly appoint a designated driver when
drinking with friends. A follow-up poll at the end of the season in
June showed the figure climbing to 72 percent.
   ``I don't take those numbers literally,'' said Jay Winsten,
assistant dean at the Harvard School of Public Health. ``I think
it's strongly biased by respondents who want to give the socially
acceptable answer. But there's been a shift in public perception of
what a socially acceptable answer is.''
   Winsten says tough talk is still needed to combat drunken
driving.
   ``It needs to be viewed by the public as a major source of
violent crime,'' he said. ``Until it is viewed by the public that
way, we're not going to solve the problem.''
   A Roper poll published in July found 89 percent of respondents
saying the designated driver is a good or excellent way to cope
with drunken driving. That was the highest level of support among
several options, such as running public service advertisements,
using random police roadblocks and holding servers legally
responsible.
   Some businesses have encouraged use of designated drivers during
the holiday season.
   Crum &amp; Forster Insurance Group in Basking Ridge, N.J., sent
``designated driver'' cards before Thanksgiving to its 2,200
employees, entitling them to a free non-alcoholic drink at a
participating restaurant.
   In California, where a new law in 1990 lowers the threshold at
which a person is legally drunk, some 100 Marin County restaurants
and bars have agreed to serve free coffee and soft drinks to
designated drivers. Even video shops are offering free tape rentals
to sober drivers.
    In Boston, the Hard Rock Cafe is sponsoring a contest from New
Year's Eve until St. Patrick's Day, in which patrons will be
encouraged to designate a driver. The driver will receive free
non-alcholic drinks, and when the contest ends one of them will be
chosen at random to receive two free tickets to London.
   ``We're not discouraging drinking,'' said Sharri Miller,
secretary at the restaurant. ``We're offering a safe alternative
home.''
   Winsten said some groups, such as young men who go out drinking
together, are the toughest to influence even though they represent
one of the highest risk groups.
   ``You're not going to change them without a cop with a billy
club,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviets Tough it Through New Year's Parties Champagne in Short Supply</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Professor Iosif Nikolaevsky, standing in line for
some cherry wine at a Moscow food store, doubted he'd be able to
get hold of champagne for his New Year's Eve toast.
   He shrugged and said, ``If I can't get champagne, I'll drink
tea.''
   For most Muscovites, shopping for the traditional New Year's Eve
family feast is the toughest it has been in memory, and what hurts
most is the shortage of champagne, geese, chocolates and other
holiday delicacies.
   ``It's the hardest this year,'' sighed pensioner Lydia
Sergeyeva, handling the jar of murky fruit compote she had just
bought in the Gastronom on central Moscow's Kutuzovsky Prospect,
and recalling past years when she could purchase meat and sausage
easily.
   Like a dozen other shoppers interviewed in the store, she blamed
supply problems on perestroika, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of
reforms, but accepted them with equanimity. ``It's a transitional
period. It's natural for there to be breakdowns,'' she said. ``But
we're optimists.''
   Nearby, a young man walked up to the display of dirt-encrusted,
withered carrots, picked-over cabbages and giant jars of pickled
tomatoes and shook his head. ``It's a nightmare,'' he said. ``What
to do?''
   The prospect of toasting the new year without the old bubbly so
concerned the official news agency Tass and government newspaper
Izvestia that they launched investigations into the champagne
shortage.
   ``Not to raise a glass of champagne at New Year's _ such a thing
was not demanded even during the toughest time of the campaign of
total sobriety,'' Tass complained Saturday.
   Gorbachev brought in an anti-alcohol campaign soon after coming
to power in 1985, but it faded after bootleg brewing mushroomed and
state income shrank from lost vodka sales. This year's champagne
shortage was clearly not engineered by government teetotalers.
   Tass reporters went from store to store in search of the sparkly
stuff but encountered only embattled salespeople, angry customers,
wine factory workers who claimed to have fulfilled their production
plans, and store managers who maintained they had never received
shipments.
   The baffled reporters finally explained the shortage with
typical Moscow accusations: Much of the champagne went to the
privileged elite, and shoppers from out of town snatched up the
rest.
   Izvestia, however, went deeper in its search. In an article
headlined ``Will we have champagne on New Year's Eve?'' it
determined that the Soviet Union, for all its fame as an exporter
of vodka and ``Golden'' champagne, produces yearly only about one
bottle of champagne per person.
   Glass factories, using technology unchanged since 1926, put out
less than half the bottles needed each year, further limiting
champagne producers, the newspaper said.
   The Izvestia report echoed the government line on the reason for
widespread shortages. Gorbachev and other party leaders say the
``period of stagnation'' under past leaders left the country's
industrial base in dangerous disrepair, made people lose their
taste for work and left them indifferent to quality.
   Delicacies and gifts are freely available in the markets, where
farmers, craftsmen and private cooperatives sell their wares at
prices they set themselves. But free-market prices tend to horrify
Soviets used to state subsidies on most food and small necessities.
   Slaughtered piglets at one of the capital's 28 farmer's markets
were going for 100 rubles, or $160 each, the labor daily Trud said,
and cucumbers and tomatoes cost about $15 a pound.
   ``If it keeps on like this, then in order to buy food for a
holiday, we'll have to save money all year,'' the newspaper said.

   A huge avalanche struck southwestern
Switzerland and killed six Swiss skiers, rescue officials said
Saturday.
   The avalanche was 1,000 feet wide and hit the Mt. Simplon region
Friday. The victims were five youths and a guide who were on a
two-day tour in the region. Searchers in a helicopter found their
bodies.
   Officials said two of the youths apparently had been able to
free themselves from the masses of snow but then died of exposure

<TEXT>
   Members of a pro-Iranian terrorist
group arrested in Spain were planning to use surface-to-air
missiles to attack Arab and French civilian airliners, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The daily Asharq Al-Awsat, in a dispatch from Madrid, quoted
unidentified Spanish officials who questioned the suspected
terrorists, believed linked to the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah.
   Spanish police refused to comment on a similar report that
appeared Dec. 28 in the Madrid daily Diario.
   Last month, police discovered a large cache of explosives the
suspects allegedly were trying to smuggle into Spain.
   ``The investigations revealed that Hezbollah planned to use
surface-to-air missiles to hit NATO interests in France, as well as
passenger planes of Arab and French civil aviation airlines,'' the
Saudi Arabian newspaper report said.
   The time frame of the attacks was not clear, but the Saudi paper
said the group planned ``a series of acts of terrorism'' in France
in January.
   The report came at the same time as a bomb threat against a
Northwest Airlines flight Saturday from Paris to Detroit. An
anonymous telephone caller said the flight was targeted in
retaliation for life sentences given to two Palestinians who were
convicted in Sweden this month in a series of bombings.
   One of the Palestinians was Mohammed Abu Talb, a suspect in last
year's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.

<HEAD>From Elephant Abuse to Gun Control, New Laws Taking Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In California, it will be a crime to abuse an elephant. In
Florida, people who want to dive for scallops will have to buy a
license. In Illinois, the Tully monster will become the official
fossil.
   These and scores of other new laws take effect around the nation
Jan. 1.
   In several states, new measures are going on the books that deal
with gun control, alcohol, drugs and smoking.
   California has a law inspired by the January attack on a
Stockton schoolyard, in which Patrick Purdy gunned down five
children with an AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle and then shot
himself to death with a handgun. With the new law, military-style
assault weapons identified on a special list will be severely
restricted. The list contains some 55 pistols, rifles and shotguns
that will be barred from manufacture, importation or sale.
   Maryland will bar sale of handguns unless they are on a list of
weapons approved by the Handgun Roster Board. That law is aimed at
so-called ``Saturday night specials.''
   ``Nobody said we were going to stop crime if this occurred,''
said state Police Superintendent Col. Elmer H. Tippett. ``We only
said that it was a start to get some of this junk off the street.''
   Oregon gun buyers and people seeking licenses to carry concealed
handguns will face stiffer identification requirements and
background checks.
   In New York, a new law aims to curb underage drinking. Police
will be able to issue a $50 summons to people under 21 for mere
possession, instead of purchase, of alcohol.
   ``It will certainly help neighborhoods where raucous parties go
on and destroy the neighborhood's tranquility,'' said Doris Aiken,
a Schenectady woman who founded Remove Intoxicated Drivers. ``Kids
at Cornell University would stand in the street with beers in their
hand and wave at the police.''
   But Genevieve Connor, vice president for campus affairs for the
State University of New York Student Association, said ``a law like
this would make people potentially the victims of arrest just
because they're carrying a six-pack of beer.
   ``They may be going to make stew, who knows?''
   Two states are imposing new crackdowns on drunken drivers. In
Connecticut, police officers will be permitted to revoke on the
spot the license of a driver who fails a blood-alcohol test. In
California, it will be a crime to drive with a blood alcohol
concentration of .08 percent or greater, toughened from .10 percent.
   As part of the war on drugs, Connecticut is offering some young
male drug offenders ``boot camp''-style punishment. The state will
spend $10 million on the program, which will also include
court-ordered wilderness school sentencing for certain juvenile
drug offenders.
   A Florida ``drug-free workplace'' law championed by Gov. Bob
Martinez says that law enforcement officers, firefighters and
``safety-sensitive'' state employees may be tested for illegal
drugs when hired or when they undergo physical examinations. The
law does not require the testing and bans random testing.
   Illinois students will be forbidden to carry or use beepers on
school property because the devices are often associated with drug
dealing.
   New York's ``Clean Indoor Air Act,'' touted as the nation's
toughest anti-smoking law after Minnesota's, prohibits smoking in
auditoriums, elevators, gymnasiums, food stores, shared taxicabs
and limousines, and restricts it to certain areas in larger
restaurants and other public facilities.
   In Greensboro, N.C., smokers will face the toughest restrictions
in that state, the nation's No. 1 producer of flue-cured tobacco.
Voters in November narrowly approved the new ordinance, which
requires restaurants to set aside 25 percent of their seats for
non-smokers and bans smoking in retail stores that can accommodate
more than 200 people.
   The elephant law in California stems from the 1988 case of an
8,000-pound pachyderm named Dunda at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park. The animal was ``subjected to two days of beatings which
caused apparently severe injuries and trauma to the head area,''
according to a city attorney's report. Zoological society officials
acknowledged the beatings, but said the elephant needed to be
disciplined.
   Florida's first recreational saltwater fishing license is
expected to raise $6.5 million for fisheries and marine research in
its first year. It will cost $12 for Florida residents and $30 for
those from out of state.
   ``What were once unlimited natural resources are being depleted,
and I think most folks who will be affected recognize that
additonal revenue is needed to enhance the resources,'' said
Richard Healey, deputy director of the Florida Marine Patrol
support services.
   But state Sen. Vince Bruner said many fishing boat captains in
his Panhandle district fear they will lose business to neighboring
states.
   Illinois' new official fossil, known formally as the
Tullimonstrum gregarium, is about a foot long, has a snout like an
elephant's and is 300 million years old.
   ``I've handled a lot of heavier legislation in my time, but this
was one that I was delighted to do,'' state Rep. Larry Wennlund,
who sponsored the legislation at the behest of the son of
discoverer Francis Tully.
   Here is a look at some other new laws:
   ALASKA: Increases residency requirement from six months to two
years to qualify for the dividend given to each citizen from
Alaska's $10 billion oil-wealth savings account. It is expected to
eliminate about 60,000 newcomers from the list. This year's
dividend was $873.
   TEXAS: Requires anyone possessing a wild animal such as a lion,
tiger or bear, for ``breeding, exhibition, or personal use'' to
obtain a $100 permit.
   NORTH CAROLINA: Makes it a misdemeanor to take or sell a labeled
milk crate. Dairies complained that crates were being snatched by
people looking for convenient carriers or low-budget furniture.
   GEORGIA: Makes it illegal to heavily tint car windows. Law
officers worry about the risk of approaching a car without being
able to see the occupants.
   CALIFORNIA: Requires state government agencies to answer their
telephones by the 10th ring. The law contains no provision for
penalizing violators.

<HEAD>Last Year's Defense Budget Battle Was Just a Warmup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce fighting between Congress and President
Bush this year over cancellation of a handful of conventional
weapons is a harbinger of the battles expected over the next
military budget, lawmakers say.
   ``Secretary (Dick) Cheney opened an ugly door,'' said Rep. John
Rowland, R-Conn., looking ahead to the certain strife when the
Pentagon chief delivers his fiscal 1991 defense budget to Congress
in late January.
   Cheney touched off a tidal wave of dire predictions in the
Pentagon and concern in Congress when he directed the military
services to consider possible cuts amounting to $140 billion to
$180 billion for fiscal 1992 to 1994.
   On closer examination, the potential cuts in a 1992-94 Defense
Department wish list reflected a Pentagon realization that its
future spending levels would not differ significantly from the
amounts Congress approved during the past five years, defense
analysts and lawmakers say.
   White House budget planners have told Cheney he can spend a
little more than $292 billion in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
That means the budget would not keep pace with inflation, which the
administration estimates is averaging 4.1 percent. Congress
approved $286 billion in fiscal 1990.
   When Congress weighs the new budget, it will have to consider
whether to reduce military spending even further.
   Lawmakers balked this year when Cheney proposed a military plan
for fiscal 1990 that eliminated 10 conventional weapons programs,
including the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the Navy's F-14D jet
fighter, but left strategic programs such as the B-2 stealth bomber
relatively intact.
   The fiscal 1990 defense budget that emerged from Congress
restored some of the money for the conventional weapons, cut funds
significantly for the Strategic Defense Initiative and trimmed the
budget for other high-tech programs.
   The nearly two-month process left some lawmakers shaking their
heads in disgust.
   ``In my roughly 20 years involved in this, I've never seen such
forceful, if not ruthless, lobbying,'' Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said of the wrangling over the F-14D jet fighter.
   But those skirmishes will seem like child's play when Congress
tackles the next budget, most observers say.
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee took a swipe
at the Bush administration on Thursday, charging that it bungled
the announcement of future defense cuts by failing to spell out a
military strategy.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said that without a strategy, the
administration faces the likelihood of lawmakers concerned with
parochial interests crafting the defense budget.
   ``I think it will be the most contentious in years ...
especially with the shrinking budget and in light of what's going
on in Eastern Europe,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., an Armed
Services Committee member.
   ``It will definitely be bloodier,'' said John Isaacs of the
liberal group, Council for a Livable World.
   Although all the budget numbers and possible weapons cuts have
not been hammered out _ and won't be officially until the budget
arrives on Capitol Hill _ likely reductions in the fiscal 1991
budget have emerged in recent weeks.
   To date, they include:
   _Slightly more than $292 billion in Pentagon spending, which
would mean the military budget won't keep pace with inflation,
according to Defense Department sources, who requested anonymity.
   _Stretching out production of the B-2 stealth bomber program,
which could raise the per plane cost of the radar-evading aircraft
from $530 million to as high as $1 billion.
   _Cancellation of the Army's M-1 tank, according to congressional
sources, who asked not to be identified.
   _Reduction of the current troop strength of 2.1 million by about
275,000 and elimination of three Army combat divisions, five and a
fraction Air Force fighter wings and about 60 naval vessels from a
fleet of 562.
   The defense budget for fiscal 1990 requires Cheney to consider
substantial troop cuts by reducing the military personnel account
by $461 million. Cheney must report to Congress by Jan. 1 to
explain how he will meet the cut.
   Also on the chopping block again is the V-22 Osprey, which
Congress delayed a decision on by approving $255 million in
research and development money for the tilt-rotor aircraft in
fiscal 1990.
   The Pentagon recently ordered the Navy to cancel production
contracts for the Osprey, although Congress had freed up more than
$300 million in production money for the aircraft that had been
appropriated in fiscal 1989.
   And The Associated Press reported Friday that the Navy is
seriously considering limiting purchases of its $1.2 billion
Trident submarine to every other year.
   The battle lines being drawn between Congress and the
administration are obvious, according to lawmakers and defense
analysts interviewed in the last two weeks. In the past, the
administration has trimmed the defense budget by eliminating or
stretching out conventional programs popular in many districts
while continuing funds for research and development of strategic
programs.
   During the peacetime buildup of the Reagan administration, when
few programs suffered, there were few complaints.
   ``In the last six to eight years, there was a lot to go
around,'' said Rowland, a member of the House Armed Services
Committee. ``Who got the dough was making the pie.''
   But without a clear threat from Eastern Europe and pressure to
reduce the defense budget, parochial interests in Congress will
clash with administration attempts to maintain a significant budget
for strategic programs.
   ``Our military priorities are wacky,'' said Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``Where
we're eliminating or prematurely terminating or stretching the
production of useful, modern conventional weapons systems in order
to produce an MX missile, the fight will go on. The battle will go
on. This will not be easy.''

   Comics Jay Leno and George Carlin and singers
Wayne Newton and Dolly Parton are among the headliners who will do
their numbers New Year's Eve for both high rollers and tourists at
Nevada casinos.
   Even Tony Bennett will leave his heart and long-running singing
engagement at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco for a one-night
show Sunday in Las Vegas at the Riviera hotel-casino.
   ``We book way in advance to get the top headliners for the New
Year's Eve show because people expect the biggest names,'' Dave
Verbon, vice president of public relations at the Riviera, said
Friday. ``All the casinos do it.''
   Hotel-casinos also usually hold expensive parties for high
rollers, which they refer to as VIPs, MVPs (most valuable players)
or just ``good customers,'' who sometimes drop large amounts of
cash and chips on gaming tables, said Brian Lawson, publicist for
Bally's Reno.
   ``We put on a special New Year's Eve banquet that's a black-tie
affair for our MVPs and they have their choice of shows
afterwards,'' Lawson said.
   The special one-night show in Bally's Reno Grand Ballroom on
Sunday night is called ``Into the '90s Laughing with George Carlin
and Special Guests.'' The room's 2,600 seats are sold out, Lawson
said.
   Country singer Randy Travis is playing to a capacity crowd of
2,000 in Bally's Ziegfeld Theatre and there's a rock 'n' roll show
for people who want to see the new year in with a blast from the
past.
   Some 150,000 tourists are expected at Las Vegas during the
three-day holiday weekend and more than 50,000 in the Reno-Sparks
area in northern Nevada, according to tourism officials.
   Rock 'n' roll hall of famers Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis
will play Bally's Celebrity Room in Las Vegas, while the casino's
other rooms will feature nostalgic appearances by '60s
chart-toppers the Four Tops and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
   Newton, a Las Vegas fixture, is playing the Hilton, the Smothers
Brothers will be bickering at the Desert Inn and the Pointer
Sisters will be singing in the new year at Caesars in Las Vegas.
   Miss Parton will play New Year's Eve and New Year's Day shows at
Caesars Tahoe on the south shore at Stateline, Louise Mandrell
headlines at Harrah's Reno and Leno cracks jokes at Harrah's Tahoe
hotel-casino.

   Robert Pirosh, who won the 1949
Academy Award for his World War II screenplay ``Battleground'' and
helped write the Marx Brothers' classic ``A Day at the Races,'' is
dead of heart failure. He was 79.
   The scriptwriter, who also wrote such TV adventures as
``Combat'' and ``Laramie,'' died Monday at St. John's Medical
Center, said ex-wife, Nancy Pirosh.
   Pirosh remained active through his later years, most recently by
teaching writing classes at the University of Southern California,
she said.
   His 1949 award-winning drama was based on the fighting between
German and Allied troops at the Battle of the Bulge.
   Pirosh fought with the 320th Infantry in the 35th Division at
Bastogne, Belgium, when U.S. troops were surrounded by German
soldiers for eight days.
   He worked as a writer, producer or director on a dozen
well-known films and a similar number of television series.
   His three-decade Hollywood career began in 1935 with ``The
Winning Ticket.''
   He was writer or co-writer of ``A Day at the Races'' for the
Marx Brothers; ``I Married a Witch''; ``Up in Arms,'' the 1944
Danny Kaye comedy; ``Hell Is for Heroes''; ``A Gathering of
Eagles''; ``What's So Bad About Feeling Good?''; ``Go for Broke,''
the 1951 recounting of Japanese-American soldiers fighting in
Europe; ``Valley of the Kings''; ``Spring Reunion'' and more.
   On some of those films, including ``Go for Broke'' and ``Valley
of the Kings,'' he also served as director.
   As a television writer, he wrote the pilot programs for
``Laramie'' and ``Combat.'' He also wrote several segments of
``Hawaii Five-O,'' ``Ellery Queen,'' ``Mannix,'' ``Bonanza,''
``Ironside,'' ``The Waltons'' and ``Barnaby Jones,'' among others.
   Survivors include two sons, a daughter and his sister. At his
request, there will be no services.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's customers in Minnesota are losing
a privilege dating from a kinder, gentler time that is unheard-of
for fast-food customers in most states: paying for their burger and
fries with a personal check.
   Starting Monday, company-owned outlets of the fast-food chain
throughout the state will stop accepting checks. But it's not bad
checks, it's the high cost of living that's to blame.
   The decision was prompted by the mounting cost of check
processing, said Steve Kopel, operations manager for McDonald's
regional office in Bloomington.
   ``We're a high-volume, penny-profit business,'' he said.
Processing can cost 6 to 10 cents, depending on where the bank is
located, and while losses from bad checks are part of the problem,
``we really haven't seen a great increase,'' he said.
   Company officials said the idea of paying by check for a $3 Big
Mac meal has been unheard-of in other states. Other national
fast-food retailers said Minnesota is one of the few states where
they will take checks.
   Though company-owned McDonald's are nixing checks, restaurants
operated by independent licensees can set their own check policies,
said Kopel. Some already have banned them, he said.
   Consumer reaction to the policy will be closely monitored by
company executives through January. ``We're going to certainly
apply some common sense to this,'' Kopel said.
   Some of McDonald's competition, such as the company-owned White
Castle and Burger King restaurants, have long refused to accept
checks, even in Minnesota. Company-owned Taco Bells in Minnesota
recently quit taking checks.
   Minnesota remains one of the few places in the country where
other major fast food chains, such as Kentucky Fried Chicken and
Arby's, continue to accept them.
   ``The problem here is if you don't accept checks, people will
walk away,'' said Judy Cook, president of the Minnesota Retail
Merchants Association. Minnesotans assume it's their right to pay
by check rather than cash, even for the smallest amount, she said.
   By contrast, she said, ``people on the East and West coasts
don't write checks for under $10.''
   ``It may be that Minnesota is a more trusting community,'' Cook
added.
   But not everyone can be trusted. Some merchants complain that
the number of worthless checks coming their way has increased over
the past few years, she said.

   It was the second year Gorbachev has won the contest sponsored

were being taken to apologize.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega retaliated for the search of
the ambassador's residence Friday by ordering the expulsion of 20
U.S. diplomats.
   In Washington, the State Department said today that the soldiers
who searched the home found a large cache of weapons but returned
them when they realized the residence was occupied by a Nicaraguan
diplomat.
   The State Department said Nicaragua's response was ``an
irresponsible overreaction'' intended to reduce the U.S. Embassy's
ability to monitor the fairness of general elections scheduled in
Nicaragua on Feb. 25.
   In another development, the Vatican promised to work toward
resolving the crisis over ousted leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In Rome, the Vatican today declared it did not intend to ``block
the course of justice'' by giving refuge to Noriega, who is wanted
in the United States on drug trafficking charges. He has been in
the Vatican's Panama City embassy since Sunday, four days after the
United States invaded Panama.
   The Vatican Secretariat of State also said in a communique that
it was continuing to examine the case with U.S. authorities ``in a
spirit of serene collaboration'' in hopes of finding a mutually
acceptable solution.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said on Friday the Vatican
could not hand over Noriega to the Americans but was urging him to
leave its embassy in Panama City on his own. The Vatican also
demanded that U.S. troops stop harassing the Vatican mission with
loud music. Navarro warned that ``further steps will be taken'' by
the Vatican if the harassment continued.
   The rap and rock music, which has included numerous taunting
songs, seemed intended to torment Noriega. U.S. troops turned down
the volume late Friday afternoon, and it stopped this morning.
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Antenor Ferrey said about 60 U.S. troops
ordered him, seven Nicaraguan staff members and two Panamanians to
leave his residence on Friday while American soldiers searched the
house for two hours.
   Neighbors of the residence in northeastern Panama City said
soldiers fired shots in the air. A U.S. C-130 transport plane and a
helicopter flew overhead.
   ``This violates the principal foundations of the
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions,'' Ferrey told a news
conference. ``The North Americans are going to pay for it.''
   ``They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!'' Ortega said in Managua.
   Ortega announced late Friday in Managua that his government was
ordering 20 U.S. diplomats to leave Nicaragua within 72 hours and
reduce its support staff from 320 employees to 100. It was unclear
whether any of the support staff were Americans and whether they
also would have to leave the country. Many members of the support
staff are Nicaraguans.
   The United States does not have an ambassador in Managua, and it
was not also immediately known whether U.S. charge d'affaires John
Leonard, the top U.S. diplomat, would be expelled.
   American troops have been surrounding Nicaragua's Embassy, but
not the residence, since the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion. The troops have
also ringed the Cuban and Libyan embassies on a hunch Noriega
associates might seek refuge.
   U.S. Air Force Col. Ronald Sconyers, a Southern Command
spokesman, said today that the search of the house Friday was based
on ``reliable information'' from a Panamanian citizen that it
countained a large arms cache.
   Reading from a statement, he said the search was made ``with
good cause'' and said the official Nicaraguan Embassy residence was
listed as being an apartment in another part of the city, thus it
was the position of the United States that the house searched did
not have diplomatic immunity.
   Ferrey told reporters that he moved more than a year ago and
that he argued for 75 minutes with the commander of the operation,
asking him to double-check his information but that the commander
refused.
   The front wall of the house bears a large Nicaraguan seal.
   A senior U.S. Embassy official said at a press briefing today:
   ``It was a mistake. We do not go into diplomatic residences.''
   Speaking on condition that his name not be used, the official
said the troops did not know it was a diplomatic residence until
the search was well under way and that when they realized it they
apologized and left.
   ``The had no orders to search if they knew it was the
ambassador's residence,'' the official said.
   He said the United States would take ``appropriate steps'' in
terms of an official apology, but he did not say what those steps
might be.
   He said the Nicaraguan response of expelling U.S. diplomats from
Managua was ``disproportionate.''
   Ferrey said the troops seized five rifles that were for
self-defense, then returned the arms with apologies. However, a
watch and $1,000 in cash appeared to be missing, he said.
   Sconyers said there were many more weapons there, including four
Uzi machine guns, 11 AK-47 rifles, grenades and anti-tank weapons.
   The State Department statement said the cache included four
Uzis, six rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 12 AK-47s, three hand
grenades, 10 FEN rifles, 17 bayonets, 1 M-1 carbine, one shotgun,
four rocket-propelled grenade sights, one light anti-tank weapon,
27 rocket-propelled grenade rounds, approximately 1,300 rounds of
ammunition of various caliber.
   The State Department said the soldiers entered the residence
after receiving a tip that arms were hidden there and that the
weapons they found were clearly ``in excess of normal requirements
for defending the residence.''
   ``When it was determined that the residence was that of a
Nicaraguan diplomat, the weapons were returned. The Nicaraguan
government claims that the Nicaraguans were mistreated during the
search are not accurate. There was no damage to the house or
injuries to the occupants,'' the State Department said.
   ``Despite the fact that we expressed our regrets about the
incident, which involved a substantial weapons cache, the
Nicaraguan government has taken the decision to expel the majority
of U.S. personnel assigned to our embassy in Managua and to reduce
drastically the number of Nicaraguan employees.
   ``This is an irresponsible overreaction and clearly motivated by
Nicaraguan desires to reduce the size of our mission... By reducing
our mission drastically, the Nicaraguan government hopes to curtail
severely our ability to monitor the fairness and openness of the
elections.''

<HEAD>Romania To Need Loans From West; Prospects Uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If a country like Romania were just an
ordinary person applying for a mortgage or a loan, bankers would
consider him or her an excellent risk.
   But Romania's prospects are uncertain.
   The country has a well-educated work force, good land and
mineral resources, almost no foreign debt and a surplus in world
trade. But it will need massive credit to switch from a controlled
communist economy to something more like a free market system.
   The problem for world lenders is that Romania's past behavior
under communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu gives little clue to
what it will do in the future under a government whose shape cannot
yet be foreseen.
   ``With a person you can look at past behavior,'' said Pietra
Rivoli, an assistant professor of business administration at
Georgetown University. ``With a country you look at ability to pay.
...
   ``The United States has an enormous debt, but it's able and
willing to meet its payments,'' she said.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the congressional Joint
Economic Committee, predicted that a large flow of goods and money
will be needed in Eastern Europe if market prices are to be set
free from the control of communist governments.
   Goods also are needed to keep inflation down.
   ``Those countries have a goods shortage,'' he told reporters
last week. ``When you free prices you'll have a terrible inflation
unless they have goods from the West.''
   Vladimir Tismaneanu, who came to this country from Romania, told
a television interviewer that Ceausescu paid off his country's
foreign debt because he did not want anyone to be in the position
of a creditor objecting to human rights abuses in Romania.
   When Tismaneanu left in 1981, Romania owed foreigners more than
$10 billion. By last year, the debt was less than $2.8 billion.
   To get that reduction, Ceausescu imposed a severe austerity
program, exporting as much as possible _ including Romania's
normally abundant food supply _ to get the necessary cash.
   The Central Intelligence Agency calculated that Romania was the
only major country in Eastern Europe where per capita income
declined in 1988. Its figure was the lowest in the region: $5,490.
   Tismaneanu said this situation opens the possibility for loans.
   John Steinbruner, who directs foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, was sceptical,
   ``Romania has been very, very isolated,'' he said in an
interview.
   ``Its internal development is primitive. There will be a
response to appeals for help, but it will be aid rather than
investment. They'll have to show a fair amount of political
stability and responsible policy before there's any investment.''
   The Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia all are
installing new policies meant to attract foreigners into joint
ventures and other projects that will bring new capital and
know-how.
   Romania lags far behind them, according to Kate Holder, research
associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
   ``The provisional government has no idea what to do,'' she said.
   ``There won't be any economic reform until after the election in
April. ... I can't imagine anyone considering investment in Romania
yet.''

<HEAD>Germanys Join Forces to Prevent Neo-Nazi Mayhem on New Year's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Germanys have joined forces to keep
rallies by neo-Nazis from ruining the first New Year's that Germans
on both sides of the border can celebrate together.
   East Germany on Saturday opened new border crossings to make it
easier for Germans to cross over into their neighboring country to
mark the end of a momentous year and the beginning, perhaps, of a
new era of closeness.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a televised New Year's
message to be aired Sunday, credited the reform movements in the
Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary for making the democratic
revolution in East Germany possible.
   ``This past year has brought the unity of our fatherland a good
deal closer,'' Kohl said. ``After decades of division, awareness of
the unity of our nation is alive.''
   In another interview to be published Sunday, West German
President Richard von Weizsaecker said a joint head of state for
East Germany and West Germany is ``conceivable.''
   But in the interview with the Hamburg-based newspaper Bild am
Sonntag, Weizsaecker cautioned that Germans in both states must be
patient in bridging the divisions.
   Kohl and other conservatives have fueled a confrontation between
those who support reunification and those who feel East Germany
should remain independent.
   Ultra-right activists planned to use the more relaxed border
procedures during the weekend to infiltrate East German border
towns and demonstrate for reunification, according to officials in
the West German city of Fulda.
   Viking Youth, a neo-Nazi group fashioning itself after the
Hitler Youth, has appealed to radical sympathizers to cross into
East Germany from Hesse state with flashlights and fireworks to
stage a noisy demonstration, the Fulda officials said.
   Erwin Maisch of the West German border patrol in Fulda and
regional police chief Karl Ball told reporters West and East German
authorities agreed to increase patrols in the area.
   East German officials warned last week of an increase in
neo-fascist incidents during the past year because of the dizzying
pace of reforms. Massive protests in East Germany ousted the
hard-line leadership in a matter of weeks.
   A New Year's Eve gathering of the Viking Youth has been
forbidden by Fulda regional council chief Fritz Kramer, who warned
that right-wing demonstrations could lead to ``violent
consequences.''
   Several hundred women from both sides of divided Berlin
demonstrated along East Berlin's famed Unter den Linden
thoroughfare Saturday to protest fascism.
   The demonstrators, led by Eva Rohmann of the East German state
women's organization, denounced vandalism by right-wing extremists,
who last week targeted a Soviet war memorial in the suburb of
Treptow.
   Neo-Nazi desecrations have reportedly been on the rise in East
Germany in recent months, but officials claim most of the
disturbances are created by radicals from West Germany.
   Participants in the peaceful pro-democracy rallies held in
Leipzig each Monday contend that many banners pressing for
reunification are the work of West German ultra-rightists.
   West German border authorities said Saturday they were informed
of at least 20 temporary pedestrian crossings opened along the East
German border with Bavaria state to facilitate the heavy traffic
expected on the holiday weekend.
   More than 350,000 East Germans arrived in West Germany in the
two days prior to noon Saturday, and more than 50,000 West Germans
crossed into northern East Germany, authorities said.

<HEAD>Popular TV Program Disappears From Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State-run radio and TV dropped without explanation
last week's broadcast of the country's most popular program, whose
controversial and free-wheeling shows have been a lightning rod for
conservative criticism.
   One youth newspaper, Moskovsky Komsomolets, complained Saturday
that the decision to pull the two-hour ``Vzglad'' program from the
Friday night schedule smacked of the heavy-handed pre-glasnost
censorship of the media _ ``in a word, to spit on public opinion
and forget about it.''
   Alexander Lyubimov, one of the creators of ``Vzglad,'' or View,
said by telephone that the ``directors of Gostelradio made a
decision to reduce the amount of political programming on the eve
of the New Year.''
   He refused to comment further on the decision.
   ``Vzglad'' has used the freer atmosphere of glasnost to tackle
touchy subjects. In spring, members of the Communist Party Central
Committee expressed outrage when stage director Mark Zakharov
suggested on the program that Lenin's body be removed from display
in a mausoleum on Red Square and buried.
   Since then, the idea has gained some public support among Soviet
intellectuals.
   Boris Nepomnyashchy, director of the nationwide radio network
Mayak that is another branch of the state radio and TV complex,
told listeners during a live call-in program Saturday that the
``Vzglad'' program for Friday was not ready and would be shown
shortly after the New Year's holiday, his secretary said.
   Instead of ``Vzglad,'' viewers were shown a program dedicated to
the work of Leningrad theater director Igor Vladimirov. Television
sources said the decision to pull the Friday edition of ``Vzglad''
was made Thursday. Only the Communist Party daily Pravda was able
to make a last-minute change in its program listing.
   Sources close to ``Vzglad'' said the program would be back on
the air Jan. 5 but that TV schedules in the future would list only
``youth program'' in their late evening time slot, allowing
different programming to be substituted at the last minute.
   They denied Moskovsky Komsomolets' report that plainclothes men
had entered the program's studios and seized all copies of the
intended program, which the newspaper reported was to be a parody
of the stodgy nightly TV news program ``Vremya.''
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
program was to air a piece on human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov who died Dec. 14, and a historical review of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform effort.
   Soviet media have come under pressure lately from Gorbachev and
other officials to narrow the scope of the public debate about the
Soviet past and instead try to build a consensus on how to solve
difficult social and economic problems.
   But one ``Vzglad'' source speculated that the cancellation of
the program was instigated by Gorbachev's conservative foes to make
the Soviet leader look bad before a public that would assume the
program only could be canceled on his authority.
   Moskovsky Komsomolets also claimed that a ``black list'' of rock
groups that should not be shown on Soviet TV was circulating at the
state television studios.

<TEXT>
   State-controlled Radio Uganda claimed
Saturday that Sudanese troops attacked a small Ugandan military
post at the border town of Oraba, killing one soldier.
   The broadcast quoted a Ministry of Defense statement as saying
the Sudanese army troops struck the border post Friday morning and
were still in Ugandan territory at nightfall.
   The report said the Sudanese troops were traveling in 16 trucks
and supported by an armored personnel carrier and artillery. It
said the small border post detachment withdrew after one of its
members was killed in the attack. The Sudanese force then moved
farther into Ugandan territory, it added.
   The report could not be independently verified.
   Sudanese Embassy officials in Kampala refused to comment on the
report.
   Sudan's army has been fighting an insurgency in the southern
half of the country for nearly seven years, and the rebels often
cross into Uganda for sanctuary.
   The Ugandan military high command has accused the Khartoum
government of ``aiding and abetting'' Ugandan guerrillas who
operate along the border.
   In October, Uganda claimed several Sudanese warplanes bombed
another border town, Moyo, killing several civilians.

<HEAD>Exposure to Cold Kills 75 in India, Bangladesh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 75 people, many of them
homeless, have died of exposure to cold overnight temperatures in
northern India and Bangladesh during the last three days, news
reports said Saturday.
   Temperatures plummeted to near freezing, chilling people who
have little in the way of clothing or shelter to cope with the
brief winter in this normally hot, sunny region.
   At least nine more deaths were reported Friday in Bangladesh,
bringing the toll to 44 since Wednesday, newspapers in Dhaka said.
   In India, 20 people have died of the cold in northern Bihar
state since Wednesday night, United News of India reported from
Patna, the state capital.
   Seven people, including four homeless people, died of cold in
the same period in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state, Press Trust of
India said. It added that many birds were found dead of cold in the
fields.
   Gujarat state reported four deaths, Press Trust said.
   The mercury dipped to 38 degrees, the lowest temperature of the
season, in New Delhi on Friday night and to 41 in Bihar and
northern Bangladesh.
   Midday highs this week have reached the low 60s, but many
people, even those with shelter, are ill-equipped to cope with the
overnight temperatures.
   Most of Bangladesh's 110 million people live in houses with mud
floors and walls made of thin straw mats.
   In both countries, the homeless sleep on the ground, with the
luckier ones wrapped in blankets. Some kindle small fires with
scavenged scraps of paper.

<HEAD>Court Says City Did Not Discriminate Against Battered Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court rejected the claim
by three battered women that the city of Butler discriminated
against them by limiting the number of people who could live at a
shelter proposed in a residential neighborhood.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to
District Court to consider whether the city would be equally fair
if it banned such shelters from other types of neighborhoods.
   Three battered women, using fictitious names, filed a class
action suit challenging the City Council's refusal to approve an
application by the Volunteers Against Child Abuse Center of Butler
County to use a building it had contracted to buy. The suit was
thrown out and the women took the case to the appeals court.
   In an opinion last week, the appeals court held that the
ordinance limiting ``transitional'' dwellings to six residents, not
counting staff members, was not arbitrary and thus did not violate
the plaintiffs' constitutional rights of free association and due
process.
   The ordinance was ``rationally related to the legitimate
government objective of controlling density in a residential
neighborhood,'' the court said. But in areas other than
single-family-home neighborhoods, such a ban might not prove to be
as rational, the court said in returning the dispute to the lower
court.
   The plaintiffs had argued a shelter that did not house 12 to 15
women and children was economically unfeasible.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Demand Faster Liberalization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMAL HALABY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament deputies on Saturday demanded
more democracy and improvements in the economy as they debated
whether to give a vote of confidence to the new government of Prime
Minister Mudar Badran.
   Lawmakers predicted that approval of Badran's 25-member Cabinet
was likely in the vote Sunday, despite the tough attacks on his
government.
   The debate caps a revival of life in the Parliament. Last month,
Jordan held its first general elections in 22 years.
   King Hussein on Dec. 4 named Badran to form a new government.
The Cabinet he formed will have the task of negotiating with
Parliament on new legislation, but first it must win a vote of
confidence from Parliament.
   Twenty members of the Moslem Brotherhood, the largest bloc in
the 80-man Parliament, said in a joint statement they would abstain
unless the government agreed to stricter Islamic laws, quick repeal
of martial law, reinstatement of public officials fired for
security reasons and a ban on liquor sales in public places,
including aboard Royal Jordanian airline flights.
   The large number of deputies rising to address Parliament forced
Speaker Suleiman Arar to postpone a vote on the question until
Sunday.
   Abdullatif Arabiyyat, delivering the Brotherhood's joint
statement, said Brotherhood deputies had told Badran earlier that
they would cooperate ``with a strong, clean government,'' although
efforts to agree on ministerial seats for the Brotherhood collapsed.
   ``And then we were faced with a surprise ... a government that
was much below the level of our aspirations and the aspirations of
the people,'' he said.
   Hundreds of people jammed the public galleries for the debate,
sometimes applauding deputies below. About 100 others demonstrated
in front of the building to demand immediate freedom for political
prisoners.
   Even some steadfast loyalists of the king said they would vote
against the new government, despite a series of measures by Badran
to loosen martial law, restrict the security forces and free the
press.
   Former Royal Court Chief Thouqan Hindawi accused Badran of
helping create the kingdom's debt crisis during earlier terms as
prime minister from 1979 to 1983, and he said it was difficult to
determine how the money was spent.
   ``Where is the rest of the money, Mr. Badran?'' asked Hindawi,
who resigned as King Hussein's chief aide to run for Parliament in
November during Jordan's first nationwide election since 1967.
   Economic problems caused by the debt crisis led to four days of
rioting in April that toppled the government of then-Prime Minister
Zaid Rifai and led Hussein to launch a series of liberalizing
measures.
   Many Jordanians allege that government corruption caused much of
the economic problems.
   Since taking office, Badran's government has eliminated some of
the security checks for passports and work permits and has stripped
most of the work from martial law courts, as well as liberalizing
the press.
   But many of the deputies speaking Saturday demanded full repeal
of martial law, imposed during the 1967 war with Israel, and
legalization of political parties banned more than 30 years ago.
   Some also called for investigations into the country's economic
distress and trials of those deemed responsible.

<HEAD>Garri Kasparov Passes Bobby Fischer, Is Strongest Chessplayer in
History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 1 begins a new era for chess as world
champion Garri Kasparov surpasses American Bobby Fischer to become
the highest-ranked player in history.
   According to the biannual ranking list, published by the
International Chess Federation on Friday and effective from Jan. 1,
Kasparov is rated 2800.
   Fischer's highest rating, based on scores against other
internationally ranked players, was 2785.
   ``It gives me great pleasure,'' said Kasparov, the 26-year-old
Soviet champion. ``At some level it's important for the chess world
that this belongs to the current world champion, to a real player,
not a ghost.''
   Some experts had suggested Fischer could never be bettered,
Kasparov said. ``But now people can see that chess does improve.''
   Fischer overwhelmed Boris Spassky in the 1972 world championship
finale in Rekyavik, Iceland, but refused to defend his championship
crown in 1975. For more than 17 years, the eccentric genius, now
46, has lived a reclusive life in Pasadena, Calif., and has not
competed in public.
   ``It's a stupendous achievement,'' said Grandmaster Larry Evans,
a former U.S. champion who seconded Fischer during his climb to the
top, speaking by telephone from his home in Reno, Nev. ``I would
still like to see a match between Fischer and Kasparov, but it's a
vain hope.''
   ``Kasparov has maintained his level of achievement for many
years, while Fischer simply disappeared.'' Evans said.
   ``Fischer and I belong to different times,'' Kasparov said.
``You can't compare players from different epochs.''
   In 1975 former world champion Mikhail Botvinnik declared, ``In
the hands of this young man lies the future of chess.''
   Eleven years later, Kasparov defeated archrival Anatoly Karpov
in their second title duel and became, at 22, the youngest
titleholder in history.
   When Kasparov crushed Grandmaster Tony Miles 5.5-0.5 in a 1985
match, Miles exclaimed: ``I thought I was playing the world
champion, not some 27-eyed monster who sees everything in all
positions!''
   Impatient, outspoken and decisive, Kasparov publicly criticized
Soviet sports officials a year before Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed
greater openness.
   Kasparov has a British manager to look after his business
interests, appears live on Western talk shows and has been
interviewed by Playboy magazine.
   In March, he married Maria Aratova, a 24-year-old English
translator for the Novosti news agency.
   In October, he overwhelmed Deep Thought, the world computer
champion 2-0 in a match in New York.
   His remaining ambition, he said, ``is to beat Karpov
convincingly.'' The personal and professional rivalry between the
two has already stretched over a record-breaking 131 games. The
38-year-old Karpov's rating fell back on the new list to 2730.
   Kasparov also is involved in battles away from the board.
   Following a long-running and bitter dispute with the chess
federation president, Florencio Campomanes of the Philippines,
Kasparov in 1986 created an Association of Grandmasters, known as
the GMA, to give palyers a greater say in the running of their game.
   Its aims, he said, are to ``raise the image and financial status
of chess to the highest possible level. To get real support for the
game.''
   At a meeting of the GMA in December, Grandmasters accepted by 4
to 1 a resolution from Kasparov calling for the GMA to take control
of the 1990 world championship final.
   The chess federation has given the match to Lyon, France, but if
Kasparov's move succeeds, the second half of the 10-week title duel
could be staged in the United States. Likely venues are New York,
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.
   ``There is no doubt I will play in the United States,'' Kasparov
said.

   There is historical precedent for the Vatican
agreeing to turn over a fugitive to the United States, although the
Holy See maintains it cannot surrender ousted strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega from its embassy in Panama.
   The Vatican adopted an entirely different position when asked to
turn over one of the suspected conspirators in the 1865
assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, John H. Surratt Jr.
   Surratt, a young Confederate spy who had conspired with John
Wilkes Booth to abduct Lincoln in 1864, fled after Booth shot
Lincoln on April 14, 1865.
   Surratt, a devout Catholic, changed his name to John Watson and
joined Pope Pius IX's Zouaves Regiment in late 1865 or early 1866.
The unit was part of the army that defended the Papal States, at
that time an independent country about the size of West Virginia,
against claims by Italian nationalists.
   Surratt was located in 1866 with the help of an informer who
recognized him and reported to U.S. authorities, whereupon
Secretary of State William H. Seward notified Secretary of War E.M.
Stanton.
   ``As we have no treaty of extradition with the papal government,
it is proposed that a special agent be sent to Rome to demand the
surrender of Surratt,'' Seward wrote Stanton on May 28, 1866.
   Accordingly, the U.S. envoy to the Vatican, Rufus King, sought a
meeting with the pope's foreign minister Cardinal Antonelli to tell
him about Surratt.
   ``His Eminence was greatly interested by it, and intimated that
if the American government desired the surrender of the criminal,
there would probably be no difficulty in any way,'' King wrote
Seward on Aug. 8.
   Several months later, having ascertained that Watson was indeed
the fugitive Surratt, Seward instructed King to ask the cardinal
``whether his Holiness (the pope) would now be willing, in the
absence of an extradition treaty, to deliver John H. Surratt upon
authentic indictment and at the request of this department, for
complicity in the assassination of the late President Abraham
Lincoln.''
   So eager was the Vatican to help the United States, that it did
not even wait for an official request and ordered Surratt arrested
immediately.
   ``Some surprise perhaps may be expressed that Surratt was
arrested by the Papal authorities before any request to that effect
had been made by the American government,'' King wrote Seward.
Vatican authorities ``gave me to understand that the arrest was
made with the approval of his Holiness, and in anticipation of any
application from the State Department.''
   The Surratt and Noriega cases are similar in that the Vatican
still doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States _
or Panama _ but the two incidents differ in another significant way.
   In the present instance, the Vatican says its embassy can't,
under international law, give up an asylum-seeker to a third
country _ the United States. It can only give up Noriega to Panama,
the Vatican says, if it decides Noriega doesn't qualify as a
political asylum case.
   Surratt's case didn't end with papal cooperation, however, for
the fugitive proved to be wilier and more agile than the six men
sent to escort him from his regiment to Rome on Nov. 8, 1866.
   The arresting officer reported to his superiors that Surratt,
alias Watson, ``leapt from a height of 23 feet on a very narrow
rock,'' landed on a garbage heap, and disappeared.
   King received repeated assurances and documentation from
Cardinal Antonelli proving the Vatican's good faith in the affair
and describing efforts to locate Surratt. In fact, several days
after the escape, the papal war minister Gen. Kauster ``called to
inform me of a rumor which had reached him'' that a wounded Surratt
had checked himself into an Italian hospital near the papal
frontier, King wrote Seward.
   A U.S. diplomat gave chase from Rome, but missed Surratt, who
had set sail for Egypt on Nov. 17, 1866.
   Surratt eventually was tracked down in Alexandria, and a U.S.
warship brought him back to the United States.
   A postscript to the affair:
   Surratt's mother, Mary, who ran a boarding house that Booth and
his co-conspirators had used as a meeting place, was hanged along
with three other group members.
   Surratt was tried by a civil court in Washington in 1867. He was
freed by a hung jury.

<HEAD>Bush Calls US Military Search in Panama a ``Screw-Up''</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Leads with eight grafs to UPDATE with Bush comments on search
of Nicaraguan ambassador's residence and situation with Vatican over Noriega.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today said today the U.S. military
search of the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence in Panama City
``was a screw-up,'' but added that the heavy arsenal found in the
home ``makes you wonder exactly what our young men are up against
down there.''
   The president, speaking to reporters after an 18-hole game of
golf at the Houston Country Club, said that apologies were being
made to the Nicaraguan government for the episode. But, Bush said,
``life goes on.''
   ``When you find those kind of weapons caches, even though I
think in retrospect that we shouldn't have gone in there, it makes
you wonder exactly what our young men are up against down there,''
Bush said. ``I don't know what they need rocket launchers for in a
man's house.''
   ``It's a screw-up and they (U.S. military officials in Panama)
have expressed their regrets that it happened,'' Bush said. He
added that ``it shouldn't have happened and that's been explained
to the Nicaraguans.''
   Bush also said that he was not seeking a fight with the Vatican
and that he hoped that rhetoric could cool down on both sides of
the stalemate over the fate of deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who has sought refuge in the Vatican's embassy in
Panama.
   ``If need be, I'll get on the phone with the holy father,'' Bush
said, adding, ``I don't think it will come to that ... we have good
relations with the Vatican.''
   However, Bush added, ``they have a history of giving asylum to
people who are fleeing _ even thugs like Noriega.''
   The president said he was ending the year satisfied that
conditions are stabilizing in Panama, despite the standoff on
Noriega's future. ``The man at least is off the streets,'' Bush
said.
   Earlier today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked if
the United States would retaliate for the expulsion of its
diplomats from Nicaragua, said, ``No course of action's been set.''
   Defending the U.S. military search of the residence where the
Nicaraguan ambassador was staying, Fitzwater said, ``We didn't know
it was an ambassador's residence.''
   ``They got a tip. They were looking for arms and they found
arms,'' Fitzwater told reporters in Houston. ``We were looking for
arms caches. We're finding them all over Panama City. Arms caches
are turning up everywhere.''
   ``It's part of the standard mopping-up operation. Discovering
and confiscating these weapons is important to maintaining the
peace and in line with all the reasons we went into Panama in the
first place,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the people in the home did not identify themselves when
U.S. troops arrived to conduct the search.
   On Friday's 75-20 vote by the United Nations General Assembly
condemning the U.S. invasion of Panama, Fitzwater said, ``We felt
we did the right thing for the right reasons.'
   The administration disputed Friday a Vatican claim that the
United States is ``an occupying power'' in Panama. But it also
sought to sooth building tensions with the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``The Vatican's doing a fine job,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
appreciate their efforts. We continue to work with them in a very
positive way. We think that they've taken a very serious and
constructive role in this episode.''
   The Vatican has refused to turn over Noriega _ holed up in the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City since Christmas Eve _ to the United
States, despite insistent U.S. demands that he be brought to
Florida to face drug-trafficking charges.
   On his flight to Houston aboard Air Force One on Friday, the
president waved and grinned at reporters traveling with him but had
nothing to say.
   And Fitzwater made it clear the White House preferred to have as
little as possible to say about the tense standoff or about
negotiations on Noriega's future.
   ``There's just not much that we have to say or want to say while
this is going on,'' he told reporters.
   After arriving here, Bush had dinner with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and Scowcroft at a private Houston club.
   On Sunday, Bush was to travel to San Antonio to visit two
military hospitals, Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center and
Brooke Army Medical Center, where many of the more than 300 troops
wounded in Panama are being treated.
   The president was to return to Washington late New Year's Day
after a half-day fishing excursion in Alabama.
   Bush and hunting companions Baker and Houston oilman William
Farish bagged 20 quail during their hunting excursions on Farish's
10,000-acre ranch near the South Texas town of Beeville, Fitzwater
said.
   Baker also caught a 19-pound turkey, which was cleaned and
dressed and brought to Houston by the president. ``We eat our
game,'' Fitzwater said.
   Animal rights demonstrators had staged a protest outside the
ranch, claiming Bush's hunting did not square with his ``kinder but
gentler'' rhetoric.
   Although Fitzwater said the administration wanted to avoid
further confrontation with the Vatican, State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher in Washington took issue with the Vatican's
description of the United States as an occupation force in Panama.
   ``We are down there with the consent of the government of
Panama, the legitimately elected leaders of Panama,'' Boucher said.
``That means we're not an occupying power.''
   Fitzwater had said talks with Roman Catholic Church officials
were proceeding in ``a positive vein'' and refused to be drawn into
an argument with the Vatican.
   On how long it might take to end the stalemate, Fitzwater said:
``We can't predict how long it will take. We'll just go calmly
along....''
   Meanwhile, Bush on Friday sent ``warm'' congratulations to
Vaclav Havel on his election as president of Czechoslovakia.
   The White House said the election of the once dissident
playwright ``marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in
Eastern Europe.''

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Sweeping Democratic Reforms; Restores Historic
Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Saturday approved sweeping
democratic reforms that for the first time in 45 years allow the
formation of new political parties, protect private property and
scrap the Communists' guaranteed leading role in society.
   Lawmakers also restored Poland's historic name and national
emblem, both changed after the Soviet-backed Communists took power
in 1944.
   In an emotional end to the session's work, members rose and sang
the national anthem and ``God Who Watches Over Poland.''
   The two houses of Parliament had met in almost constant session
over the past four days, passing the most radical economic reforms
ever attempted in the East bloc and creating a more democratic
constitution.
   ``I am optimistic,'' Solidarity Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki told reporters during a reception in Parliament when
asked what he thought the coming year would bring.
   The constitutional amendments give citizens the right to create
independent political parties. Until now, the Communist Party, the
Democratic Party and the Peasant Party were the only legally
recognized parties in Poland. Solidarity, which began as a labor
union, has become a de facto political party.
   The amended constitution also guarantees the protection of
private property, much of which was seized by the Communists at the
end of World War II.
   The Senate approved the changes on a 79-0 vote with two
abstentions. The Sejm, as the lower house of Parliament is called,
adopted the amendments 374-1 with 11 abstentions late Friday, but
Senate approval of Sejm votes is required for bills to become law.
   The amendments drop or modify articles in the constitution
inconsistent with democratic reforms introduced since Solidarity
scored a stunning victory in June elections that led to formation
of the East bloc's first non-Communist government.
   The amendments restored the Republic of Poland as the country's
official name from the People's Republic of Poland, which was
imposed by the Communists four decades ago.
   A smiling announcer on the late afternoon news program
TeleExpress greeted viewers in the ``Republic of Poland.''
   Following similar action in other formerly rigid Communist
countries in Eastern Europe, the Parliament deleted a
constitutional clause that guaranteed the leading role of the
Communist Party in society.
   The amendments also restored democratic language and traditions,
changing a phrase that called Poland a ``socialist society'' to a
``citizens' society.''
   In addition, the pre-war crown that graced the head of the eagle
on the national emblem was restored. The crown symbolizes Polish
sovereignty and unity.
   After the Senate vote, an eagle with a crown, brought two weeks
earlier by a farmer, was hung in the Senate hall.
   The farmer, whose name was not noted when he made the gift to
the Senate's Human Rights Commission, said the eagle was the only
souvenir he had of his father.
   In addition to their legislative sessions, Poland's political
leaders, who less than a year ago were at odds with each other, met
to exchange greetings for the New Year.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa met Saturday with Communist Party
leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski. Mazowiecki met with Communist
President Wojciech Jaruzelski on Friday after Cardinal Jozef Glemp
made the first postwar visit by a Polish primate to Parliament.
   On Friday, the Senate approved a package of 11 economic laws
backed by the Solidarity-led government to create a market-oriented
economy and reduce inflation.
   If successful, the economic package, which covers credit policy,
joint ventures, foreign capital, hard currency, customs and
taxation, will transform economic life in Poland.
   Two laws on unemployment are designed to protect the 400,000
workers the government estimates could lose their jobs as Poland
makes the difficult transition to a market economy. The plan is
likely to result in the closing of some inefficient enterprises.
   Other laws regulate financing of state enterprises and limit the
growth of wages, a measure designed to hold down inflation now
running at 900 percent.

   Dancing and drinking to strains of ``Auld

year, since a city ordinance forbids dancing on Sundays at places
where beer is being served.
   It's OK to drink on Sunday, but you can't do both.

its New Year's Eve bash for Saturday night, a day early.
   The mayor said folks began worrying about it too late for him to
do anything. And even if the city board had tried to vote an
exemption, they'd still have to check with the attorney general.
   ``I don't think I'd have the executive power to say go ahead and
open up for your New Year's party,'' Mayor E.S. Bishop said last
week. ``I don't think it would be legitimate for me to say that.''

   The Bible from start to finish is on the
reading list this weekend for members of a local church.
   ``When we finish early Sunday, we will have read for 54
consecutive hours, and will have read all 1,159 chapters and all
773,746 words of the Bible,'' said Mark Taylor, minister of the
University Church of Christ.
   The Bible marathon began at 6 p.m. Friday and was to end at
midnight Sunday. Some of the congregation's 70 members and other
volunteers began reading from the book of Genesis at the church,
while another group in Oxford's town square began reading from the
middle of the Bible.
   ``Two groups is the only way we can get through the entire Bible
over the weekend,'' said church deacon Carl Martin. Officials said
they hope the marathon will encourage folks to read the Bible more
on their own.

   What may be the smallest chapel in the world
has been dedicated on an artificial island in the middle of a
2-acre pond here.
   Chandler Mason of Oneida erected an 8-foot lighted cross in the
pond three years ago, and later decided to go a step further and
build a church there. It church was dedicated Friday.
   The chapel was framed with 2-by-4s, and has white aluminum
siding and a shingled roof. A friend cut three cathedral-shaped
windows, and others are building the 5-foot steeple and stained
glass windows.
   The 1989 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records lists
Union Church in Wiscasset, Maine, as the world's smallest, with a
floor area of 4{ by 7 feet.
   Mason's ``Cross Island Chapel'' is one inch smaller in both
dimensions. When Mason and his family finished the church's parts,
they built a small sled and dragged the parts to the middle of the
pond and erected the chapel. It now sits on a foundation of five
tons of gravel and cement that Mason had poured earlier into the
pond _ wheelbarrow-load by wheelbarrow-load.
   Mason says that by summer, he plans to install two custom-made
pews, a tiny pulpit and an altar. Already, couples have contacted
him about using the church for wedding ceremonies, he said.
   ``That's fine with me, but guests will have to bring their own
boats,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bargainers Continue Marathon Coal Strike Negotiations</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top prospects uncertain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bargainers for the United Mine Workers and the
Pittston Co. continued marathon negotiations Saturday as they
pushed for an end to a bitter strike that's idled coal miners in
three states since April.
   The two sides returned to the table about 9 a.m. Saturday after
meeting behind closed doors at a Washington hotel until about 2:30
a.m., said Herb Fishgold, an aide to mediator W.J. Usery.
   Saturday's daylong bargaining session was the fourth since
Christmas.
   Both sides were under a gag order imposed by Usery and it was
unclear whether the same kind of progress was made during the
latest round of negotiations as was reported during the
pre-Christmas meetings.
   Usery, a former labor secretary named by Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole to mediate the coal talks, said last week he'd like
to have a tentative settlement by New Year's Day for miners in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   At the UMW office in Castlewood, Va., District 28 President
Jackie Stump said he had been telling striking miners, ``if it does
happen it will be great, but just don't depend on it.''
   Even if Pittston miners start off the year with a new contract,
things won't be the same as before in the coalfields before the
bitter dispute, Stump said.
   ``It's going to take a while, and maybe a long time ... for the
wounds to heal,'' Stump said.
   Some 1,700 coal miners in the three states are on strike against
Pittston. The union said the company's decision to end
contributions to a United Mine Workers retirement and health plan
and job security were the main issues. The miners had worked 14
months without a contract before the strike began April 5.
   The violence-marred walkout was prompted by Pittston's refusal
to contribute to the UMW's industry-wide fund for miners'
retirement and health plans for some 130,000 pensioners. Pittston,
the nation's largest coal exporter, says it cannot afford the
payments other U.S. coal companies make because it faces greater
costs in sending coal abroad.
   Union leaders said other coal companies also would refuse to pay
into the benefit plan if Pittston's attempt to stay out held up.
   The UMW has given each striker about $200 a week in benefits,
and the union said it would give strikers a $1,250 Christmas bonus.
The union is facing fines totaling $63.5 million for violating
court orders limiting picketing and other strike activities.
   Pittston has hired replacement workers, but production has been
well below pre-strike levels. The company reported its coal
operations lost $3.6 million in the second quarter of 1989 and $9.8
million in the third quarter, compared with profits of $9 million
and $7.4 million in the respective quarters of 1988.

   A political party that favors Lithuanian
independence from the Soviet Union has been formally recognized by
the republic, making it the first legal non-Communist party in the
country, acvitists said Saturday.
   The new party is the 2,000-member Party of Democrats of
Lithuania, which advocates full autonomy for the Baltic republic of
3.7 million people, said Pyatrus Pechelunas, a member of the party
presidium.
   The party supports neither socialism nor capitalism but believes
Lithuanians should choose an economic system after the republic
achieves independence, he said from the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.
   Alternative political parties were illegal until early December,
when the Lithuanian Parliament eliminated a section of the
constitution guaranteeing the supremacy of the Communist Party and
substituted a multiparty system for the small republic.
   Non-Communist parties have cropped up elsewhere in the Soviet
Union but remain illegal. Lithuania's Baltic neighbors, Latvia and
Estonia, are expected to vote in January on similar constitutional
amendments permitting multiple political parties.
   Also registered Friday was the independent Communist Party of
Lithuania. A party congress voted 855-160 last week to break away
from the Soviet Communist Party and support independence for the
Baltic republic.
   The registration of the two Lithuanian parties also was reported
Saturday in the Moscow-based Sovietskaya Rossia newspaper.
   The moves in Lithuanian have brought furious complaints from
Kremlin leaders, who delegated President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, head
of the Soviet Communist Party, to travel to Lithuania in the near
future to discuss the controversy.
   Meanwhile, conservative Communists formed a provisional
leadership for a Communist Party that would remain an integral part
of the Soviet one, Tass reported Saturday. The group opposes
independence, said Vladislav Shved, a secretary of the
``provisional Central Committee,'' in an interview with the Defense
Ministry newspaper Red Star.
   The newspaper quoted Shved as saying the group hoped Gorbachev's
visit would swing wavering Communists back into the Kremlin's
embrace.
   Gintautas Alksninis of Sajudis, the main Lithuanian activist
group, estimated the pro-Moscow group has the support of
approximately 20 percent of the 204,000 Communist Party members in
Lithuania.
   Alksninis, speaking by telephone from Vilnius, said numerous
political parties are signing up members in Lithuania and they
should be registered soon. The Social Democrats are the largest of
the non-Communists, he said.
   The first election pitting alternative parties in Lithuania will
be the republic's parliamentary election Feb. 24.
   In the first election with multiple candidates in March, those
backed by Sajudis trounced conservative Communists who had held
positions of power for decades. Sajudis, as a broad-based
pro-democracy group, includes members of various parties, including
progressive Communists.
   The growing independence of the Baltic nations and other Soviet
republics presents Gorbachev with one of his most pressing
problems. His advocacy of reform since taking power in 1985 helped
fuel movements that toppled hard-line governments in Hungary,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, East Germany and Bulgaria this
year.
   But Gorbachev, faced with the same sort of reform movements that
he encouraged elsewhere, is trying to slow such nationalism to
prevent the breakup of the Soviet Union.

   Nicaragua's expulsion of 20 American diplomats
from Managua after U.S. troops found an arms cache at a Nicaraguan
diplomat's residence in Panama City was an ``irresponsible
overreaction,'' the State Department said Saturday.
   The expulsion order from Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega was
``clearly motivated by Nicaraguan desires to reduce the size of our
mission before Nicaraguan elections in February,'' the State
Department said in a statement.
   ``By reducing our mission drastically, the Nicaraguan government
hopes to curtail severely our ability to monitor the fairness and
openness of the elections,'' the statement said.
   The wide array of weapons discovered during Friday's search of
the residence were returned when U.S. troops determined they had
searched the residence of a Nicaraguan diplomat, the State
Department said.
   Shortly after the search, Ortega said 20 American diplomats were
being expelled from Managua in retaliation for the incident.
   Nicaragua's ambassador to Panama, Antenor Ferrey, said U.S.
troops surrounded his residence in Panama City, ordered all
personnel outside and searched the building for weapons.
   The State Department said U.S. troops were ``reacting to
reliable information regarding an arms cache'' when it searched the
residence. It was occupied by individuals who turned out to be
members of the Nicaraguan diplomatic mission, the department said.
   Ferrey had said five rifles were seized and later returned by
U.S. troops with apologies, but the State Department said Saturday
that U.S. troops located weapons ``in excess of normal requirements
for defending the residence.''
   The State Department said the cache included four Uzi machine
guns, six rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 12 AK-47s, three hand
grenades, 10 FEN rifles, 17 bayonets, one M-1 carbine, one shotgun,
four rocket-propelled grenade sights, one light anti-tank weapon,
27 rocket-propelled grenade rounds and approximately 1,300 rounds
of ammunition of various caliber.
   The residence was not damaged and there were no injuries to the
occupants, the department said, adding that the United States had
``expressed our regrets'' about the incident.
   The State Department declined to identify the expelled
diplomats, but Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry identified them as:
Louis Falino, John S. Boarman, J. Warren Navarre, Christopher
McMullen, Katherine M. Igmanson, Susan Kay Mutschler, Barbara M.
Hamm, Jacqueline N. Dontric, William J. Overton, Robert L. Delves,
John W. Fuhrer, Mary S. Gaber, Santiago Urieta, John Durham,
Michael J. Weidmann, Frank R. Newland, Deolinda S. Armijo, John T.
Torres, Pauline E. Davis and Valentino Martinez. Government
newspapers have accused Martinez of being an adviser to Nicaragua's
political opposition alliance.
   The top U.S. official in Managua, charge d'affaires John
Leonard, was not on the list.

   Michael White takes over as mayor this week,
beginning the task of pursuading developers to give as much
attention to neighborhoods in the 1990s as they did to rebuilding
the downtown in the past decade.
   Some of the city's neighborhoods ``look like Germany in 1945,''
he said.
   White, 38, says he has been dreaming of being mayor since he was
a teen-ager.
   ``I've sought this prize for 24 years,'' said White. ``The
things I've done ... have basically been designed to get me where
I'm going to be Monday,'' he said in an interview last week.
   White resigns as a state senator effective Sunday, before being
sworn in Monday. He also has been a Cleveland councilman and
Columbus housing director.
   As mayor, he succeeds George Voinovich, who has held the post
since 1979. Voinovich has been credited at least partly with
steering Cleveland out of financial default and sagging esteem. His
is now seeking the GOP nomination for governor.
   White beat a fellow Democrat, City Council President George
Forbes, in a non-partisan race in November after a bruising
campaign during which White was called a slumlord. He acknowledged
he had rental properties that need repairs.
   Early in a five-man primary _ the city's most heavily contested
mayoral race in more than a decade _ White was considered a long
shot.
   Forbes chose the mayoral race over seeking re-election to City
Council, where he had reigned as president for 16 years. He is
returning to private law practice.
   During the Voinovich and Forbes era, the Cleveland skyline
expanded with office towers, a Lake Erie harbor project and the
start-ups of two bank skyscrapers, hotels, a shopping mecca and a
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. There's also talk of a new baseball
stadium.
   Voinovich said pointedly that he and Forbes ``are leaving with
the lights on and the cranes hanging.''
   But White says the downtown renaissance hasn't improved the
quality of life in many of Cleveland's neighborhoods. He promised
that his administration would foster growth on both sides.
   ``I think that what I bring to the office is kind of a view of
balance,'' he said. ``Our neighborhoods are falling apart. Some of
them look like Germany in 1945.
   ``You cannot have a great town with only a great downtown. There
has to be a balance.We will continue to lose people in this town if
we do not restore the quality of life at the neighborhood level.''
   In the past 20 years, the city's population has declined to
550,000 from 800,000.
   Other problems include a nearly 50 percent dropout rate in the
city school system, 40 percent of the population living below the
federal poverty level, shabby public housing with maintenance so
poor that the city had to name a new housing authority director to
get federal aid, and drug peddling and other crimes common in big
cities.
   One of White's goals is to add about 240 officers to bring the
city's police force up to 2,000.
   Others are establishing a better environment for small
businesses, building more housing, and continuing to encourage what
he sees as improvement in race relations in a city where the
black-white population is roughly even.
   White also said he favors tax abatement to encourage economic
growth, but said he would wring from developers as many
stipulations beneficial to the city as he could, such as certain
percentages of jobs given to Clevelanders and funding for
neighborhood improvements.
   More than $200 million in tax abatements have been granted to
developers of downtown in the past two years.
   ``If we build 100 new buildings but six or seven out of 10 of
those jobs continue to go to suburbanites, then we haven't made any
progress,'' he said. ``And today, six out of 10 jobs in Cleveland
go to people who don't live here. That's why we have so much
poverty.
   ``I've said to the business community, yes, I will help them
with economic development, but they must help me with the creation
of new jobs.''
   With White's swearing-in comes a wave of fresh faces. One-third
of the 21 council members are new, and a new council president was
named after Forbes' departure.

<HEAD>9-Year-Old Boy Accused Of Selling Crack To Undercover Agents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old boy accused of offering crack cocaine
to an undercover police officer was released to his grandmother and
police searched for the teen-ager who allegedly supplied drugs to
the youngster.
   ``With all the shootings and terrible things we see, this has
affected us the most because he is supposed to be innocent,'' said
Deputy Superintendent Robert Hayden. ``He is supposed to be worried
about what he got for Christmas, how he is going to set up his
Nintendo game.''
   The 3-feet-11 boy weighing 95 pounds, had $68 in his pockets at
the time of his arrest, police said. Police said he offered an
officer a bag thought to be crack.
   Among other youngsters arrested around the country on crack
charges this year have been a 10-year-old Detroit boy in August and
a 10-year-old boy on Long Island in New York in January. Last year,
Boston police arrested an 8-year-old boy who allegedly was holding
drugs for a dealer.
   The Boston boy was arraigned Friday in Roxbury District Court on
juvenile delinquency charges and released to the custody of his
grandmother, with whom he has been living while his mother is in
prison, police said.
   Hayden said the boy was scared and crying when he was taken into
custody Thursday and police tried to make him comfortable during
his jail stay. They sent out for a chicken dinner and an officer
sat with him all night.
   ``It was a very sad and traumatic thing to see a little
9-year-old boy sitting in the station arrested for drugs,'' Hayden
said. ``I saw some veteran officers with tears in their eyes over
this incident.''
   An arrest warrant has been issued based on information provided
by the 9-year-old, police spokeswoman Mardi Sullivan said Saturday.
   The youngster reportedly gave the first name and described a
teen-ager believed to be between 16 and 18 years old, as his
supplier.
   ``The little boy would go out and sell until the end of the
night when he would reach the older person who would give him
money'' for the sales work, said Hayden. The boy told police he had
been selling for about two weeks.
   Charles Dickerson, a juvenile officer at the Area B station,
said the youngster needs better supervision than his grandmother
can provide and police will ask Tuesday to have him turned over to
the Department of Social Services.
   ``He's used to getting out there and staying with the older
kids,'' Dickerson said. ``He's been seen at 11 p.m. with older
kids.''
   Hayden said three undercover officers went Thursday night to
Warren and Copeland Streets where there had been reports of heavy
drug activity. One officer was approached by the boy who said,
``What's up?''
   ``What do you got?'' asked the officer.
   The boy reached into his pocket and handed the officer what is
believed to be crack, the highly addictive form of cocaine. After
the arrest, officers found 80 small bags of crack nearby.

<UNK>Government Officially Names Collor de Mello Brazil's Next President</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Saturday formally
declared Fernando Collor de Mello the winner of Brazil's first free
presidential election in 29 years.
   Collor de Mello, 40, of the rightist National Reconstruction
Party, narrowly defeated socialist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, 49
percent to 44 percent. The election was held Dec. 17.
   ``I am sure God will give me the strength to govern this country
with open arms, together with the judiciary and the Congress, whose
participation is indispensable,'' said Collor de Mello after
receiving a presidential diploma from the Supreme Electoral Court
during a morning ceremony.
   Collor de Mello had 35,089,998 votes after 100 percent of the
70.26 million ballots cast were tallied, Supreme Electoral Court
President Jose Francisco Rezek said.
   Da Silva, of the radical left Workers Party, received 31,076,364
votes.
   Rezek said 986,446 of the total ballots cast were blank, 3.1
million were annulled and 11.81 million were abstentions. Voting is
mandatory for Brazilians between 18 and 69.
   Collor de Mello is expected to face stiff opposition in
Congress, where his party has only 24 seats, just 3 percent of the
total.
   The president-elect will take over from President Jose Sarney on
Mar. 15, 1990, for a five-year term.
   However, pressure is mounting for Sarney to resign early.
   Several Cabinet ministers have said Collor de Mello should take
office soon to adopt emergency economic measures to bring down
inflation, which ran at 1,765 percent in 1989.
   Sarney, a civilian who took office in 1985 after an electoral
college vote, said he would step down from office early if
Congress, which is now in recess, voted to shorten his mandate.

   When a group that claimed responsibility for two
mail bomb assassinations made a blanket death threat against NAACP
officials, that blanket might well have been dropped over Earl
Shinhoster's head.
   Shinhoster, Southeastern regional director for the NAACP, has
emerged as a potential target of someone's apparent grudge against
his group and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``I've always understood very clearly the security implications
for what I do,'' Shinhoster said Friday night.
   ``These folks are deadly serious, whether this is isolated,
whether it's one or two issues involved,'' Shinhoster said. ``I'm
less concerned about reasons here as I am about how to deal with
it.''
   ``I'm really concerned for Shinhoster and others with the
NAACP,'' said Charles King, an Atlanta civil rights activist.
``This is very serious for them, but the rest of us ... I don't
think we're that much at risk.''
   Shinhoster's jurisdiction in the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People includes Georgia, Alabama and
Florida, the three states that make up the 11th Circuit of the
federal appeals court.
   Package bombs killed 11th U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance on
Dec. 16, and Savannah, Ga., lawyer and civil rights activist Robert
Robinson two days later. Two others were intercepted at the 11th
Circuit building in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., NAACP
office.
   In August, a mailed tear-gas bomb went off in Shinhoster's
office, injuring eight people _ at about the time letters declaring
war against the 11th Circuit popped up at several television
stations.
   And a threatening letter _ much like the one in which
``Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial System'' claimed
responsibility for the bombs that killed Vance and Robinson _
arrived at Shinhoster's office shortly after the tear-gas did.
   ``I think it was very specific and targeted,'' Shinhoster said.
``I don't think it was happenstance.''
   Authorities have confirmed that the letters appear to come from
someone involved in the mail bombings.
   Shinhoster said that link means he probably will be greeted by
guards, police and FBI agents wherever he goes, at least in the
immediate future. On Friday, he said, police officers met him at
the airport in Savannah, where he went for a funeral.
   ``When I got back on the plane, they put me on the plane,'' he
said.
   James D. Williams, national spokesman for the Baltimore-based
NAACP, said the organization has taken extra security precautions
he would not specify.
   ``We believe that this latest incident is an effort to
intimidate our association, to strike fear in our hearts,'' said
NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks. ``It will not succeed. We
intend to go about our business, but we will most certainly be
taking precautions.''

   President Bush called the ransacking by U.S.
troops of the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence in Panama City ``a
screw-up'' that should not have happened, but questioned why the
Sandinista envoy was ``up to his eyeballs'' in rocket launchers,
grenades and automatic weaponry.
   At the same time, Bush predicted the diplomatic standoff with
the Vatican over the fate of deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega soon would be resolved to the United States'
satisfaction.
   Bush, winding up a year-end vacation, told reporters after a
round of golf that ``the death of a lot of our kids'' in the Dec.
20 invasion of Panama has made him determined to bring Noriega to
justice, not let him slip off into exile in a third country.
   Bush said U.S. military authorities have apologized to
Nicaraguan Ambassador Antenor Ferrey for the incident Friday, which
has led Nicaragua to order 20 U.S. diplomats out of their country.
   ``It's a screw-up and they have expressed their regrets that it
took place,'' Bush said at the 18th hole of the Houston Country
Club after finishing a round with national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft, friend Will Farish and golf pro Doug Sanders.
   But Bush said the arms cache that U.S. troops found inside
Ferrey's house ``makes you wonder exactly what our young men are up
against down there. I don't know what they need rocket launchers
for in a man's house.''
   ``I'd like to know what the man's doing with rocket launchers
and grenades and Uzis and automatic weapons up to his eyeballs in
his house,'' the president said. ``Having said that, we should not
have gone into that diplomatic premises.'
   In Washington, the State Department said the cache included four
Uzi machine guns, six rocket-propelled grenade launchers, 12
AK-47s, three hand grenades, 10 FEN rifles, 17 bayonets, one M-1
carbine, one shotgun, four rocket-propelled grenade sights, one
light anti-tank weapon, 27 rocket-propelled grenade rounds and
approximately 1,300 rounds of ammunition of various caliber.
   The weapons were ``in excess of normal requirements for
defending the residence,'' the State Department said. A department
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity declined to
define ``normal requirements for defending'' a residence.
   The official also declined to say what types of weapons U.S.
envoys in places such as Managua might have at their homes, calling
it ``a security question.''
   Earlier Saturday, the Vatican, which on Friday had called the
United States an ``occupying power,''' issued a conciliatory
statement saying talks about Noriega's fate continued between the
Holy See and U.S. authorities ``in a spirit of serene
collaboration.''
   The Vatican predicted they will eventually yield ``a just
solution which will be mutually satisfactory.'' It said the papal
nuncio, in allowing Noriega into the embassy, never intended ``to
block the course of justice regarding a person accused of serious
crimes.''
   Bush said, ``I think it's time to cool it on both sides.'' He
said he would personally call Pope John Paul II if need be.
   Bush said the church has a long history of granting asylum, even
to ``thugs'' like Noriega.
   ``We have a complicated three-way conundrum at this point,''
Bush said. ``I really believe this matter will be resolved, one way
or another, to the satisfaction of the United States.''
   Bush even cracked a joke about the loud rock 'n' roll music the
U.S. troops encircling the Vatican Embassy have been playing,
apparently to harass Noriega. The blaring loudspeakers were turned
off Saturday.
   ``I think it aggravated the people inside. It was stopped,''
Bush said. It would have aggravated me, I'll tell you. I'm not into
rock. Country music, maybe that's different.''
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters
``They did not know it was a diplomatic residence. We do not enter
diplomatic residences.''
   Fitzwater said Bush had no advance knowledge of the U.S.
soldiers' raid on Ferrey's home.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, in ordering 20 U.S.
diplomats out of his country in 72 hours and slashing the U.S.
Embassy's support staff from 320 to 100, said ``They acted
arrogantly, like Rambos.''
   Bush was spending the weekend in his adopted hometown after
three days of fishing and hunting in South Texas. He and Barbara
Bush were flying to San Antonio on Sunday morning to visit soldiers
wounded in Panama. They were to spend New Year's Eve in their hotel
suite at the Houstonian.
   Fitzwater, asked about the lopsided United Nations vote Friday
condemning the U.S. invasion of Panama and demanding immediate
withdrawal of the occupation forces, said ````We felt we did the
right thing for the right reasons.'
   Fitzwater said the ambassador's house was raided because U.S.
military authorities ``got a tip'' there was an arms cache inside.
   ``They were looking for arms and they found arms,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``We were looking for arms caches. We're finding them all over
Panama City. Arms caches are turning up everywhere,'' he said.
   The United States and Nicaragua expelled each other's
ambassadors in an earlier diplomatic dust-up last year. The United
States had about 35 accredited diplomatic personnel in Managua,
headed by a charge d'affaires.

   A steep staircase off Palace Square
descends into a black labyrinth of dank, narrow tunnels, the secret
passages of a paranoid state.
   The dark underground corridors were dug clandestinely on the
orders of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Communist dictator who apparently
grew to fear the consequences of his increasingly repressive
24-year rule.
   A week ago, when the army moved against Ceausescu, the
dictator's dreaded special police used the tunnels to move freely
under the withering machine-gun fire in the square above.
   Soldiers and civilians armed with AK-47 assault rifles guard the
entrances now. Nervous army patrols comb the tunnels, fearful they
will find ``terrorists,'' as they call Ceausescu's police, lurking
in unknown passages.
   ``It is still dangerous,'' said one soldier, who carefully
examined the passports of three Western journalists at the entrance
to a tunnel.
   Officials of the provisional government say the tunnels near
Palace Square are only part of a vast network that extends for
miles beneath the capital.
   The passages connect major government buildings and lead to
communications bunkers or to underground stores of food, weapons
and ammunition.
   ``This tunnel was used by terrorists. The ones for the president
are much wider,'' said a provisional government official who, along
with an armed escort of four men, took the reporters on a brief
tour.
   The brick-lined tunnel used by the police was about a yard wide
and less than two yards high.
   It stretched out beyond the range of his fading flashlight to an
intersection with another that also vanished into darkness toward
the royal palace.
   ``The tunnels for the president are about 5 meters wide and they
are lined with marble,'' said the official, who didn't want to give
his name after giving the reporters the unauthorized tour.
   ``Oh, no. You cannot go there,'' he said to reporters who
inquired about Ceausescu's tunnels. ``They are still too dangerous.
We are conducting demolitions,'' he said in halting English,
declining to elaborate.
   The secret passages are dark and ominous symbols of a paranoid
state that hardened itself against its people. There are others.
When soldiers shot away the windows on the top floor of the royal
palace, they exposed concrete walls built to withstand the heavy
machine-gun fire.
   Liviu Axente, a photojournalist from Focsani, showed two Western
reporters pictures of a huge underground bunker in that city 125
miles north of the capital.
   ``They (security forces) have bunkers like this in every
district,'' he said. ``They intercepted every telephone call, read
everyone's mail.''
   ``There are hidden microphones in my house,'' he said. He showed
reporters pictures of the munitions, including sophisticated
automatic weapons, he said were found in the bunker and given to
the army.
   He also had pictures of the electronic eavesdropping equipment
and of a vast collection of security files, placed in boxes stacked
to the ceiling.
   Photographs of the inside of the files showed photocopies of
intercepted letters and postcards and of reports on monitored
telephone calls.
   It has been just a week since the popular revolt ousted, seized
and executed Ceausescu. Outraged Romanians are still struggling to
uncover the extent of the madness of Ceausescu's ``golden era.''
   Ceausescu lived in an opulent villa, with gold leaf and marble
floors in the entrance way and golden fixtures in the bathrooms.
Tapestries and paintings in gilted frames adorn the walls and
crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling.
   He dined extravagantly by the light of candles burning in golden
candelabras.
   His people had to wait in long lines with their ration cards to
buy substandard food in an agriculturally rich country.
   When the people protested, demanding bread and reform, his
special police opened fire. The tunnels, underground bunkers and
windows reinforced with concrete, suggest Ceausescu knew one day
the people might say enough.
   ``He was a monster,'' one young soldier said near the tunnel
entrance.

<TEXT>
   Opponents of plans to put a $40 million
low-level radioactive waste dump near this farming community say
they have just begun to fight, while others see the project as an
``economic shot-in-the-arm.''
   ``We'll fight this _ technically, politically and legally,''
opponent Lowell Fisher said Saturday.
   Fisher, the leader of a group called Save Boyd County, said it
felt like ``a death in the family'' Friday when a developer, US
Ecology, announced it had selected a 320-acre site about two miles
west of this community of about 580 residents for construction of
the dump.
   The above-ground system of concrete vaults would store low-level
radioactive waste, such as contaminated gloves and equipment from
nuclear power plants and hospitals, from Nebraska, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.
   Many had figured the site would be ruled out for its location,
five miles from South Dakota and therefore remote from the other
four states in the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Compact.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., called the decision unsound and said
he would fight it.
   But Ken Reiser, one of the leaders of the proponent People for
Progress, said he was elated at the prospect of economic
development and the estimated 30 to 40 jobs the facility could
bring to the area.
   ``This is one of the best things since electricity came into
this county or the day my dad changed from using a horse to using a
tractor to farm,'' Reiser said Saturday.
   US Ecology officials said they chose the Boyd County location
over two others in southern Nebraska because it was the best choice
geologically. The company already has options on the land.
Opponents say the tract contains wetlands and any leaks could
contaminate Nebraska's groundwater.
   Since Boyd County was named as a finalist site, opponents have
boycotted businesses owned by supporters, sought to recall a county
supervisor and posted ``no-hunting'' signs on their land in an
attempt to get hunters to protest consideration of the site.
   At the US Ecology office in Butte manager Bob Wittry handed out
job applications Saturday even though the company won't even submit
its license application to the state until July.
   Lavaun Johnson said that the office on Butte's main street was
the first to open in nearly a decade. Butte once boasted five
grocery stores and several car dealerships, she said.
   ``Today it's mostly two bars, a lumber company, a village-owned
restaurant and the post office,'' she said.
   Her husband, Owen Johnson, called the announcement an ``economic
shot-in-the-arm'' to the mostly farming community.
   ``It might bring some of our native sons and daughters back home
to work,'' he said. ``We've seen nothing but `ag' up here for
years, and bad times on the farm have taken their toll.''
   US Ecology has promised that the five states and their utilities
and other companies that generate waste will pay $300,000 a year to
Butte and Boyd County until the facility is built and up to $2
million each year the facility is used. That money is in addition
to tax revenue and economic benefits produced by the facility.

   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Angola on Saturday offered a new plan for ending his country's
civil war that calls for elections within five years.
   But Eduardo dos Santos said his regime still was committed to
socialism and one-party rule. He also rejected a cease-fire plan
offered by President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire, who is trying to
mediate the conflict.
   The Angolan president outlined his proposal in a New Year's
message, portions of which were broadcast on Lisbon radio.
   He called for a cease-fire and for rebels and government
soldiers to allow people and goods to move safely around the
country.
   The proposal includes recognition of the legitimacy of the
current government. It also called for incorporating the rebels of
guerrilla leader Joseph Savimbi into the Angolan army.
   In addition, the president called for the participation of all
Angolans in the affairs of the nation and for legislation on the
right of association.
   He proposed a census of the population and a revision of
election legislation, leading to national elections within five
years.
   But he added that his proposals did not imply abandoning
Angola's socialist vocation or one-party system.
   The two sides have been fighting a civil war since Portugal
granted independence to Angola in 1975.
   Savimbi is backed by the United States and South Africa and the
government is supported by Cuba. Under a peace accord signed
December 1988, Cuba agreed to withdrawn troops from Angola and
South Africa was to relinquish control of Namibia.
   However, the the Angolan government and Savimbi's forces have
been unable to reach a cease-fire accord.
   Mobuto mediated a cease-fire agreement between Savimbi and
Eduardo dos Santos on June 22 in Gbadolite, Zaire, but the truce
collapsed soon afterward. Later talks ended in deadlock with
renewed fighting.
   In his speech, the Angolan president rejected new proposals for
a cease-fire reportedly put forward within the past few days by
Mobuto.
   Eduardo dos Santos said that the proposed cease-fire omitted
provisions agreed upon during the Gbadolite meeting.
   He said the truce verification provisions in the Mobuto proposal
were more suited to conventional rather than guerrilla war.
   Earlier this week, Savimbi said government forces had launched a
major offensive against rebel strongholds in the south.
   The Angolan president made no reference to the reported fighting
in the south, according to the reports reaching Lisbon. But the
Portuguese news agency LUSA earlier quoted Angolan government
officials as denying a major offensive was under way.

   All but one of the half-dozen paintings on the
walls of the mayor's office were taken down as Edward I. Koch moved
out of City Hall after serving as New York's 105th mayor for 12
years.
   ``It's like Saigon, I imagine, was,'' Koch said to reporters
Friday, comparing his last day at work to the fall of the
Vietnamese capital to communists in 1975. ``The only thing that was
missing was the sound of helicopters to take you out.''
   Koch pointed out that the stage set up on City Hall plaza for
Monday's inauguration of Mayor-elect David Dinkins was about three
times the size of the one he used in 1978.
   ``He deserves it!'' Koch remarked.
   Koch lost to Dinkins in the Democratic primary.

   Director Costa-Gavras, known for such political
films as ``Z'' and ``Missing,'' has watched his plans for a movie
involving Eastern European characters crumble like the Berlin Wall.
   Costa-Gavras said the ongoing upheaval that has toppled
communist governments has forced big changes in a script about two
Poles living in Paris.
   ``Characters, when they speak about the country, have different
speeches now,'' he said last week. ``They don't have difficulties
going there that they used to. Everything is upside down.''
   While he waits for rewrites, Costa-Gavras said he'll be in Paris
spending the holidays with his family.
   His latest feature, ``Music Box,'' recently opened, with Jessica
Lange starring as a Chicago lawyer defending her Hungarian-born
father against charges of Nazi war crimes.

   Los Angeles Clippers basketball star Danny
Manning is being sued for more than $10,000 by a woman who claims
he insulted and punched her during a bachelorette party in June.
   Karen Hopkins alleges that Manning, who led the Kansas Jayhawks
to a national college basketball championship in 1988, punched her
in the eye and knocked her over when she told him he was rude at a
Wichita nightclub.
   Clippers spokesman Bill Kreifeldt said Manning had no comment.
   Ms. Hopkins, 31, claims her trouble began when she went to the
defense of her sister, who, the lawsuit alleges, was verbally
abused by Manning and had a beer poured on her.
   Police records indicate they were called to the club for the
June 3 party, but not because Ms. Hopkins had been injured. Police
spokesman Lt. Mike McKenna could not say Friday why police were
called, but he said Ms. Hopkins' name was in the police report.
McKenna could not elaborate on the report.
   Ms. Hopkins' attorney, Ron Beal, said she decided to sue for
compensation for her injuries rather than sign a criminal complaint.
   John Karagianis, who owns the nightclub, said his employees told
him that a scuffle broke out at the club after a crowd pestered
Manning for his autograph. Manning and a group of friends left the
club before police arrived, Karagianis said.

   Phil Peschi Sr. has been in Mummers Parades
for 62 years, and he wasn't about to let a leg amputation stop him
from being an active participant in this year's parade.
   Peschi had to get special permission to allow his wheelchair in
the New Year's Day parade as part of the Trilby String Band. The
chair is considered a float under parade rules because it has
wheels, and floats aren't allowed in the parade as part of string
bands.
   On Monday, Peschi will be in full Mummer regalia for Trilby's
presentation of ``Jungle Jive.'' He will be dressed as a tribal
chief and his wheelchair will be a throne.
   ``The chair will be `Mummerized' to look like a throne, so I can
wear a suit,'' said Peschi, who is Trilby's co-captain along with
his son, Phil Jr.
   Peschi lost his right leg to gangrene in August 1986 after being
in a coma for 14 weeks.
   He participated in the last three parades in Trilby's ``banner
car,'' which rides in front of the strutting band unit.

   More than 15,000 Israelis, Palestinians and
Europeans joined hands Saturday to call for peace, but police fired
tear gas and rubber bullets after some chanted pro-Palestinian
slogans and allegedly waved the banned Palestinian flag.
   Hospital officials said more than 50 people were injured.
   In the occupied territories, Palestinian assailants shot and
killed a fellow Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel,
and hospitals said Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians
in scattered clashes.
   The army listed one wounded and was investigating the other
reports.
   For the most part, the attempt to form a human chain around the
white stone walls of Jerusalem's Old City was as peaceful as its
intended message _ ``1990: Time for Peace.''
   Israeli youngsters with balloons held hands with monks in brown
robes and Palestinian women in traditional embroidered dresses.
Demonstrators sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and chanted ``Two states
for two peoples'' _ a wish for a Palestinian state beside Israel.
   At least twice, police and troops charged small groups of
demonstrators, swinging nightsticks and firing rubber bullets. They
used percussion bombs and a water cannon to disperse knots of
people.
   Police officials said policemen charged into the crowds because
Palestinian flags were waved and anti-Israeli slogans shouted. The
Palestinian flag is outlawed in Israel.
   Reporters covering the event saw no flags, but small groups of
Palestinians shouted slogans against Israel's occupation and in
favor of the PLO.
   ``Palestine is Arab,'' went one chant. Another was ``Intefadeh,
go ahead,'' referring to the two-year Palestinian uprising that has
killed 640 Palestinians and 43 Israelis.
   Hospital officials said they treated more than 50 people for
injuries from beatings, rubber bullets and tear gas. Police
reported about 50 arrests.
   Rita Shukair, a Palestinian-American from Kansas City, stood in
the street carrying an olive branch, trying to block the mobile
water cannon from moving toward the crowd.
   A policeman slapped her in the face and pulled her away as she
shouted: ``Do you think this is Romania? This is the land of God,
of Moses and Jesus and Mohammed.''
   About 2,000 extra police were brought in for the rally. The
violence was limited to the two clashes near Herod's Gate in Arab
east Jerusalem.
   Elsewhere, the mood was festive as hundreds of balloons were
released into the air and people linked arms in the bright sunshine.
   Salman Faroukh, 32, a Palestinian who said he was imprisoned for
11 years for belonging to Yasser Arafat's mainstream PLO faction
Fatah, held hands with an Israeli teen-ager.
   ``This is the first time I'm taking part in such an activity
because I believe we should live in peace with the Israelis,''
Faroukh said.
   The organizers _ who included Europeans groups, the Israeli
Peace Now movement and Palestinian activists _ said more than 1,200
people came from Europe.
   Police estimated the crowed at 15,000, but organizers said it
was more and complained that army roadblocks kept many Palestinians
from arriving from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Army
officials said they only kept out troublemakers.
   A women's march a day earlier, sponsored by the same groups, was
violently broken up when an outlawed Palestinian flag was raised.
   During Saturday's rally, small groups of religious Jews in
skullcaps hurled insults at the peace activists, and Israeli
right-wing political parties condemned the demonstration.
   The Italian Foreign Ministry said it protested to the Israeli
government over the detention and alleged mistreatment of Italians
involved in demonstrations Friday and Saturday.
   Among them was Dacia Valent, a deputy inthe European Parliament.
The Rome-based La Repubblica newspaper quoted her as saying police
beat her over the head, kicked her in the stomach and spit at her
after arresting her Friday.
   Arab reports said Masud Ibrahim Imadi, 28, died instantly when
three masked men shot him in his home in the Bureij refugee camp in
the Gaza Strip. The reports said Imadi, a mechanic for the U.N.
Relief and Welfare Association, was suspected of collaborating with
Israeli authorities.
   His death brought to 165 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the uprising. Most were suspected of
collaborating.
   Imadi's death was also the fourth in as many days of suspected
collaborators and comes amid calls by Arafat for such slayings to
be restrained.

<DATELINE>LEVICO TERME, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of this northern town said
Saturday that Roman Catholic Church authorities sent him a bill for
over $20,000 for a series of special Masses celebrated since 1630.
   The church said the town requested the special Masses in the
17th century when it was troubled by the plague.
   Mayor Giuliano Gaigher said church authorities were insisting on
payment of 10,000 lire (about $9) for each of seven votive Masses
celebrated each year since 1630. That would bring the total bill to
about $22,000.
   ``We are doing historical research. We haven't found any
commitment by the town'' to pay for the Masses, Gaigher said in a
telephone interview.
   Votive Masses are celebrated for a special reason or a
particular function, such as a wedding.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted local church officials as
saying they were willing to work out a solution but still believed
it should be paid.

   Contra military leaders pledged Saturday to work
with international observers to limit violence as Nicaragua
prepares for elections in February.
   One observer group said the announcement was important because
pre-election violence has been escalating in Nicaragua and talks
between Contra rebels and the ruling Sandinistas have broken off.
   International organizations are working to agree on ground rules
for monitoring and ensuring the fairness of the Feb. 25 elections.
   ``There is not full confidence that there will be a free
election process,'' said Israel Galeano, the Contras' military
chief of staff. ``Our conviction is serious to maintain support for
all observers.''
   He said at a news conference that he has 6,000 fighters in the
countryside, and they will ``take a totally defensive position'' in
the days leading up to the elections.
   But the commander said pulling Contra forces out of Nicaragua or
confining them to isolated areas for the elections would require a
similar commitment to keep Sandinista troops on bases, and that
proposal has been rejected in the past.
   Galeano, whose nom de guerre is Commander Franklin, made the
comments at a session with Contra director Aristides Sanchez and
Osorno Coleman, a Miskito Indian resistance leader known as
Commander Blaz.
   Coleman said he believes the Sandinistas have tried to inhibit
the election process in eastern sections of the country by limiting
registration, but he said the people he represents support the
election process.
   Sanchez predicted victory for the opposition ``because no one in
the world would believe the people are so masochistic that they
would elect this government.''
   Leaders of the Center for Democracy, one of the four groups that
will monitor the elections, arranged the rare appearance by the new
military leaders.
   Center President Allen Weinstein said the Contra military
leaders' pledge to limit violence was a breakthrough that could
resolve an impasse between the Sandinistas, Contras and other
opposition groups.
   ``This is the first statement with a monitoring group (present)
in which they commit themselves fully to the democratic process,''
Weinstein said.
   He said all of the monitoring groups _ the Organization of
American States, the United Nations, the Atlanta-based Carter
Center of former President Carter and the Center for Democracy _
would meet in January.
   ``We hope to (develop) a series of ironclad procedures accepted
by the government, all candidates and the different opposition
groups,'' he said.
   After the observer groups meet, representatives of the
Sandinistas, Contras and civilian opposition groups will be
invited. No specific dates have been set.
   Weinstein's center said the Contras have agreed to help
investigate any violent incidents ``to have been perpetrated by any
of the parties in the Nicaraguan conflict, including their own
fighters.''
   The setting of rules for the election process has become more
urgent because of incidents such as a Dec. 10 confrontation in the
Nicaraguan town of Masatepe between Sandinista and opposition
supporters.
   Election campaign observers said supporters of the leftist
government violently disrupted a rally held by backers of
opposition presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   Sandinista supporters reportedly charged the rally armed with
machetes and clubs. The candidate's motorcade fled town. One man
died of machete wounds, and another half-dozen were hospitalized.
   The Bush administration cited the incident as evidence the
Sandinistas, who lifted a unilaterally declared ceasefire Nov. 1,
will find an excuse to avoid holding fair elections.
   But Weinstein of the Center for Democracy said the new Contra
statement could help bring both sides together for a fair ballot.
   ``There's 60 days. There's plenty of time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Part of David Richmond's 1990 vacation
will be spent drinking orange juice at a lunch counter in downtown
Greensboro. It should be a lot easier than it was 30 years ago.
   On Feb. 1, 1960, Richmond was one of four black freshmen at
North Carolina A&amp;T State University who walked into the downtown
Woolworth, sat down at the whites-only lunch counter and demanded
service.
   The lunch counter manager said no, and the store manager said
no, but the students refused to leave.
   Thus began a movement.
   In the weeks ahead, sit-ins would spread to lunch counters in 54
cities across nine southern states. They eventually shattered one
of the more visible racial barriers of everyday life and achieved
one of the earliest victories of the budding civil rights movement.
   ``What happened in 1960 served to launch people of the city and
nation on a relentless pursuit of human dignity,'' said Claudette
Burroughs-White, co-chairperson of the Greensboro Sit-in 30th
Anniversary Committee.
   The committee is leading several biracial groups in celebrating
the actions of Richmond and fellow students Ezell Blair, Franklin
McCain and Joseph McNeil.
   The commemorative events from Jan. 31 to Feb. 3 include
banquets, symposiums, a student march from the A&amp;T campus and the
unveiling of a plaque outside the store. The four former students
also will have their bronzed footsteps set in the sidewalk.
   Richmond and his three sit-in colleagues once again will take
seats at the lunch counter, as they have done at previous
anniversary celebrations.
   ``We didn't do it for the glory or heroics,'' Richmond said.
``It was just something that was spontaneous, something we talked
about collectively. I don't think any one of us singularly would
have done it. The four of us were like a unit. We have remained
close through the years.''
   Today, he quietly goes about his duties as housekeeping
supervisor at a Greensboro health care center.
   The others have left the area. McCain is an executive with the
Celanese Corp. in Charlotte. Blair, who has changed his name to
Jibreel Khazan, lives in New Bedford, Mass. McNeil is a stockbroker
in New York.
   The re-enactments give Richmond a chance to chat with Ima Evans,
the lunch counter manager who was working at the bakery counter the
day the students came in.
   ``We are very good friends,'' Richmond said. ``We have appeared
on a couple of programs together.''
   Ms. Evans, who is white, said the sit-in put Woolworth employees
in an awkward situation. The black employees were sympathetic to
the students, as were some of the white workers, but they weren't
allowed to serve blacks.
   ``I felt they deserved to be served as much as anyone,'' Ms.
Evans said, ``but it was policy all over.''
   The Greensboro sit-ins eventually involved hundreds of students.
Each day, they showed up at Woolworth and at the Kress
five-and-dime store down the street, causing an uproar at City Hall
and in the business community.
   After months of sit-ins, meetings and negotiations, Woolworth
and later Kress agreed to integrate their lunch counters.

   Rain fell from Texas to the Middle Atlantic coast Saturday while
freezing rain and snow stretched further north from New England to
the Plains and parts of the Rockies.
   A flash flood watch was posted over a portion of east-central
Texas. Almost 4 inches of rain fell overnight at Broaddus, and rain
continued to fall Saturday morning.
   Nearly an inch of rain fell at Monroe, La., in the six hours
ended at 1 p.m. EST, while two-thirds of an inch and more fell at
Little Rock and Jonesboro, Ark.
   Flash flood watches also were posted through the night for
Kentucky and much of West Virginia.
   Snowfall amounts were modest in most places, although Hartford,
Conn., and parts of northern Pennsylvania received about 4 inches
overnight and up to 5 inches fell Saturday morning near New
Mexico's Red River.
   A winter storm watch was posted into Sunday for the Texas Big
Bend region.
   Late in the morning, snow was falling in central and southern
New England, southeast New York state, northwest Iowa, western
Wisconsin, much of Minnesota, eastern North Dakota, eastern and
central South Dakota, south-central Kansas, southeast Colorado,
southern Wyoming and north-central Utah.
   Freezing rain, often mixed with snow, fell in parts of
Pennsylvania, northern Illinois, southeast Wisconsin, southern
Minnesota, Iowa, northwest Missouri, eastern and north-central
Kansas, eastern Nebraska and northwest Texas.
   Rain was falling in north-central Texas, northern Alabama,
northern Georgia, western South Carolina, northern North Carolina,
Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, West Virginia, Kentucky,
northwest Indiana, the rest of Illinois and southeast Missouri.
   Rain and occasional thunderstorms were scattered over Arkansas,
western Mississippi, northern Louisiana and east-central Texas.
   Caribou, Maine, had its coldest December reading on record with
an early morning low of 31 degrees below zero. That shattered the
old record of 26 below in 1975.
   Bakersfield, Calif., had a morning low of 28 degrees. It was the
18th day this month with a low below the freezing point, exceeding
the previous record of 13 December days with freezing temperatures
in 1949.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states Saturday morning was
34 degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 2 degrees at Massena,
N.Y., to 81 degrees at Fort Myers, Fla.

   Nicaragua's ambassador said Saturday
that he tried for an hour to convince U.S. troops his home was a
diplomatic residence before 60 troops entered, walking under a
large Nicaraguan emblem.
   A U.S. Embassy official said the soldiers didn't know the
residence was diplomatic quarters, and the United States later
apologized for the entry.
   Nicaragua's Sandinista government retaliated against the U.S.
action by expelling 20 American diplomats and ordering the U.S.
Embassy in Managua to reduce its support staff from 320 to 100. The
State Department called that an ``irresponsible overreaction.''
   U.S. troops have been posted around the embassies of Cuba,
Nicaragua and Libya since soon after the invasion to capture Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega began Dec. 20.
   On Saturday, Noriega remained at the Vatican mission, which was
surrounded by American troops.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
troops entered the house to search for weapons.
   ``(The troops) had no orders to do that if they knew it was the
ambassador's residence,'' a senior U.S. Embassy official said.
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Antenor Ferrey said he argued with the
troops for more than an hour and asked them to call American
diplomatic and military officials before they entered the house
about 6 p.m. Friday.
   The estimated 60 troops who searched the house in the four-hour
operation had to walk under the seal.
   The embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
soldiers apparently did not see the emblem. However, a military
spokesman said that while they may have seen it, it was not a
sufficient indication of diplomatic immunity.
   Ferrey moved to the house more than a year ago.
   President Bush said the United States had apologized for the
incident.
   ``It's a screw-up and they (U.S. military officials in Panama)
have expressed their regrets that it happened,'' Bush said after a
golf game at the Houston Country Club.
   But he questioned why there were large amounts of weapons in the
residence.
   Six rocket-propelled grenade lauchers were among the weapons
found, the State Department said in Washington. The cache also
included four Uzi machine guns, 12 AK-47s, three hand grenades, 10
FEN rifles, 17 bayonets, one M-1 carbine, one shotgun, four
rocket-propelled grenade sights, one light anti-tank weapon, 27
rocket-propelled grenade rounds and approximately 1,300 rounds of
ammunition of various caliber.
   A communique from the Southern Command said the soldiers entered
``with good cause'' after receiving a tip from a Panamanian citizen
that there were weapons in ``what is now claimed to be the alleged
home of the Nicaraguan ambassador to Panama.''
   According to the military account:
   Ferrey drove up after troops had ordered people in the house to
evacuate and fired warning shots into the air. He provided an
identity card, but indicated he had left his red diplomatic
identity card at the embassy, it said.
   Troops at the residence checked with their superiors and were
told the ambassador's residence was in an apartment building at
another location.
   Based on the information that the house was not covered by
diplomatic immunity, the commander on the scene informed Mr. Ferrey
he had received authorization to search the house and intended to
do so.
   The residents and weapons were released afterwards.
   The embassy official said he understood the search stopped as
soon as people at the house produced diplomatic credentials, ``and
if that isn't the case we have a double apology to make.''
   He said the action was not a mistake until the house was
identified as one with diplomatic immunity.
   He rejected the possibility that the raid was intended to be a
signal to Noriega, hiding out in the embassy of the Vatican since
Christmas Eve, that diplomatic immunity there might not protect him
indefinitely.
   Nicaragua claimed the U.S. soldiers stole more than $2,000 and
took some clothes from the residence.
   In Nicaragua, the government gave the American diplomats 72
hours to leave, leaving 15 in the country, the minimum set by
international agreement. Most of the support staff is Nicaraguan.

   A Romanian washing his car was taken hostage by
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife as the couple tried to flee
the revolt that toppled them, a newspaper said Saturday.
   The man, who said he was forced to drive the couple around while
Elena Ceausescu held what he believed to be a gun to his head,
eventually was instrumental in their capture, the newspaper
Liberation reported.
   The Ceausescus were executed on Christmas Day.
   The leftist daily, in a report from Bucharest, said Nicolae
Petrisor, an employee at a merchandise distribution center in the
city of Tirgoviste north of the capital, described the experience
in an interview.
   Petrisor was described as a man of about 40 years old, living in
the village of Vacaresci, about four miles from Tirgoviste.
   The Ceausescus had fled their palace by helicopter early on Dec.
22 in the face of a massive uprising by protesters and rebellious
army units. They were reported captured a day later in the city of
Tirgoviste.
   Petrisor said the Ceausescus took him hostage as he was washing
a car on Dec. 22, then forced him to drive them around Tirgoviste
for several hours seeking a safe hiding place, Liberation reported.
   The dictator, in the front seat of the black Dacia 1301 TX, was
often in tears, such as when they were nearly captured by guards at
a factory, Petrisor was quoted as saying.
   ``He kept saying: In my youth there was nothing here. I did
everything for them. I did everything for them. I saw tears running
down,'' Petrisor said, according to Liberation.
   Elena Ceausescu, seated behind the driver, was much calmer, at
times holding to his neck a cold metal object that he assumed was a
pistol, the newspaper said.
   Eventually, Petrisor stopped at a plant nursery where he knew
people, and was told by Ceausescu to seek help, the newspaper said.
He went in and told about a dozen people watching the revolution
unfold on television that he had the Ceausescus outside in his car,
according to the account.
   ``Everybody laughed, because the television had already
announced the arrests of the couple,'' Liberation said.
   But eventually his look of panic persuaded them, they invited
the Ceausescus into an office, then locked them in and called the
army, the newspaper reported. A convoy came quickly and took the
couple away, probably to the nearby barracks, it said.
   The Ceausescus' trial and execution was announced three days
later, on Christmas Day.
   In Vienna, meanwhile, Austrian Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak
said Marin Ceausescu, the late dictator's eldest brother who was
found hanging in the Romanian trade mission in Vienna on Thursday,
was likely a spy.
   Loeschnak said in an Austrian radio interview there were
indications Marin Ceausescu was active in the intelligence service
of his country.
   Marin Ceausescu, 74, has been working as his country's trade
delegate to Austria since 1973.

   A Northwest Airlines DC-10 landed without
incident Saturday despite a bomb threat that prompted more than
three-quarters of the passengers to cancel their reservations on
the flight from Paris.
   ``This is probably a safer flight than any other to be on,''
said Jennifer Ruskin, a 20-year-old junior at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor. ``The interviews now with all the media are
probably the scariest part of the flight.''
   Only 22 passengers and nine crew members were on board Flight
51, said Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen, who was on the flight.
Airline officials in Paris said earlier that the plane carried 28
passengers and 14 crew members.
   ``We landed on the runway, then we taxied out at least a quarter
of a mile, then we were bused to the terminal,'' Whalen said.
   ``No one on board was forced to work this flight,'' Whalen said
of the crew. ``I slept. Most passengers enjoyed a lot of personal
attention. It was almost like having a private airplane.''
   The plane left Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris earlier
Saturday and landed at Detroit Metropolitan Airpiort in Romulus
shortly before 5 p.m. EST, an airport spokesman said. The jet can
hold 284 passengers.
   A telephone caller said the flight would be targeted to avenge
the life sentences given two Palestinians convicted in a series of
European bombings, including an attack on a Northwest Airlines
office.
   The plane's departure was delayed two hours by fog and intensive
security checks.
   ``I wasn't worried a bit, especially after all the security we
went through to get on the flight,'' said Mike Matour, 22, of
Philadelphia. ``They checked our bags two and three times and then
they checked us.''
   Norman Luck, a reporter sent on the flight by the London Daily
Express, said he was a little concerned after the plane took off.
   He said Whalen told the passengers that ``once we were on board
and those doors shut, that the plane was safe, but I don't really
know about that because throughout the flight I watched the
attendants keep checking the sky cabs, the cupboards and underneath
the seats.''
   Some of the 105 passengers who canceled said in Paris that
Northwest should have informed them earlier of the threat.
   ``They've had my telephone number since yesterday morning
locally and nobody had called me with any information of any
kind,'' said Ken Reichenbach of Portsmouth, Va. ``What I've
learned, I've learned from third-hand information.''
   The airline said Friday it would rely on the media to spread
early word of the bomb threat. Some passengers learned of it only
upon arriving at the airport Saturday.
   ``I would have been on pins and needles the whole way,'' said
Camille Major, 21, of Madison, Wis., who was headed home after
three weeks in Europe. ``Six hundred dollars isn't worth my life.
My vacation was bad and this just tops it off.''
   Northwest said passengers could change to other flights or
airlines with no penalty, and most accepted the offer.
   Security officers inspected every piece of hand luggage before
the passengers boarded, causing a brief initial delay from the
scheduled 12:40 p.m. departure.
   Armed officers of the air and border police and riot police with
dogs shepherded passengers through scrupulous check-in procedures.
Each piece of luggage was X-rayed on freeze-frame video machines.
   Even a small souvenir bust of Napoleon was put on the belt and
X-rayed separately.
   All carry-on luggage was searched by hand. The Hsia family of
Foster City, Calif., near San Francisco, waited 45 minutes before
they were cleared for passage to the departure lounge.
   On Thursday night, ABC News, quoting sources it did not
identify, reported that a man with a Middle Eastern accent called
Northwest's Detroit office and said Flight 51 would be bombed in
retaliation for the convictions and life sentences given two
Palestinians convicted in Sweden this month in a series of bombings.
   One of the two, Mohammed Abu Talb, is a suspect in the December
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   He and co-defendant Marten Imandi were sentenced to life in
prison for their parts in the 1985 bombing of a Northwest office in
Copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 20. They also were
convicted in three other bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands.
   It was not clear when the threat was received.
   Pierre Quilici, deputy chief of France's Air and Border Police,
said U.S. authorities passed on word of the threat several days ago.
   Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller in St. Paul, Minn., said
Northwest informed the FAA, FBI, CIA and foreign agencies of the
threat and was advised by the FBI not to disclose any other details
about the threat, including where or when it was made.
   The airline announced the threat Thursday after reports of it
emerged in Europe.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and airlines have come under
pressure to disclose security risks after the Lockerbie bombing,
which killed 270 people. A threat against Pan Am before that flight
was circulated within the U.S. government but was not made public.
   FAA spokesman John Leyden said Friday U.S. airlines receive
about 300 threats each year.

   The White House said Saturday it made a
mistake on the hometown of a 17-year-old Delaware girl whom it
honored as a daily ``Point of Light.''
   Stephanie Ann Fox, 17, lives in Milton, Del., not Milford, Del.,
as the White House had announced on Thursday, said White House
spokesman Stephen Hart.
   Miss Fox was born in Milford, but lives in Milton, Hart said.
   She was praised for making ``as a regular part of her life''
involvement in a student anti-drug organization and in helping to
raise funds to combat epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and
spouse abuse.
   The White House names an individual or organization each day for
best exemplifying Bush's ``thousand points of light'' theme, in
which each point represents a volunteer community service effort.

<TEXT>
   Actress Madoline Thomas, a veteran of the National
Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company, died Saturday, three
days before her 100th birthday, Press Association reported.
   Miss Thomas had been in a hospital in Weston-super-Mare, on
England's west coast, for more than a week after breaking her hip
in a fall at the nursing home where she had lived for three years,
the British news agency said.
   No cause of death was given.
   Born in Abergavenny, South Wales, Miss Thomas was an amateur
singer, pianist and actress before going onto the professional
stage when she was widowed at 52.
   She spent six seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company at
Stratford-on-Avon, notably in ``Wars of the Roses,'' and five years
at the National, where she played in ``Tales from the Vienna
Woods.''
   In 1982, when she was 92, she appeared in National's ``Uncle
Vanya,'' directed by Sir Peter Hall.
   Her West End appearances included ``The Mousetrap'' and ``Three
Sisters.''
   No survivors were listed and funeral plans were not announced.

   A group headed by former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth and California entrepreneur Thomas
Talbot has bought control of Hawaiian Airlines for $37 million.
   The deal, announced Friday, gives the Talbot Group 85 percent of
the common stock of HAL Inc., the Honolulu-based holding company
for Hawaiian Airlines and the West Maui Airport.
   Ueberroth and John H. Magoon Jr. were named co-chairmen of HAL.
Talbot was named president and chief operating officer.
   Ueberroth led a group that bid $464 million to buy Eastern
Airlines earlier this year. That deal collapsed because of acrimony
between Eastern's unions and its owner, Frank Lorenzo.
   The former baseball commissioner's first job after college was
operations manager and later vice president of a small airline in
Hawaii.
   Hawaiian Airlines serves the five Hawaiian Islands and 14
Pacific Rim cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle and Anchorage.
The 60-year-old airline's fleet of 31 planes carried 5.5 million
passengers in 1988.
   HAL lost $13 million in the first half of this year and has lost
a total of $30.6 million over the past 2{ years.

   Martin Marietta was forced Saturday
to postpone for the ninth time the first commercial launch of its
Titan 3 rocket, once again because of high-altitude crosswinds
streaking up to 102 mph.
   The rocket is to boost communications satellites into orbit for
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British Ministry
of Defence.
   Liftoff originally was scheduled Dec. 7, but a technical problem
delayed one launch effort and the rest were scrubbed because of
high winds.
   The winds had been acceptable earlier Saturday, but the speed
increased throughout the day as a series of weather balloons shot
into the sky.
   When the countdown reached the five-minute mark, the launch team
held it for 50 minutes while officials assessed last-minute balloon
data. It showed 102 mph winds at 34,790 feet, about 30 mph too high
for a safe Titan passage.
   A 10th attempt was scheduled for 7:07 p.m. Sunday night.

<TEXT>
   Two frantic weeks of investigating a series of
mail bombs that killed a judge and a civil rights leader have
produced shadowy outlines of a racist plot against the judicial
system, but uncertainty about who is responsible and when another
attack could come.
   A person or group calling itself Americans for a Competent
Federal Judicial System claimed responsibility for killing U.S.
Circuit Judge Robert Vance on Dec. 16 and Savannah, Ga., lawyer and
civil rights leader Robert Robinson two days later.
   A letter to an Atlanta television station last week threatened
stepped-up violence and claimed the justice system was lenient
toward blacks who attack whites.
   ``Protecting the innocent warrants a higher court priority ...
than granting the blacks' demand for white teachers for their
children,'' the letter said.
   FBI agents wouldn't say what leads they have gotten from bomb
fragments and a hot line set up for tips. They also would not
discuss a published report that the letter to the TV station
contained an identifying code identical to one in follow-up letters
sent to the bomb targets. But agents confirmed the letters
contained information known only to investigators and whomever was
involved in the bombings.
   Authorities said they had never heard of Americans for a
Competent Federal Judicial System, but the threats have been taken
seriously around the Southeast.
   An anchorwoman who received the letter sent to Atlanta station
WAGA received police protection. An NAACP official involved in a
21-year-old school desegregation case mentioned in that letter said
the FBI warned him he might be a target.
   The desegregation case involves the DeKalb County schools, and a
telephone caller to the bomb hotline threatened DeKalb police
earlier in the week.
   ``We did have a call from the FBI telling us they had some
information and we should alert our officers to use extreme caution
and to be extremely alert,'' said Margaret Jones, spokeswoman for
the 650-officer department. She would not elaborate on what the
caller threatened.
   The 600 Southeastern branches of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People are all taking precautions, said
regional director Earl Shinhoster. He would not elaborate, but
mentioned that police escorted him on and off a plane when he went
to Savannah.
   Security also is being bolstered for the Jan. 15 celebration of
the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who was
assassinated in 1968.
   Specialists in terrorism and criminal psychologists say whoever
sent the bombs, if not caught, is likely to strike again after
police and media attention lessens.
   ``What holds an organization like this together, if it is an
organization, is they are action-oriented people. Without action,
the organization disintegrates,'' said Brian Jenkins, a consultant
on terrorism and managing director at Kroll Associates, a Los
Angeles-based international investigative firm.
   ``You could see an attack next month or six months from now,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   William L. Waugh, an associate professor of public
administration at Georgia State University who specializes in
international terrorism, said some terrorist groups seek mainly to
spread fear, and this one may use continued threats as its means of
operation.
   ``Standard terrorism creates a credible threat, and after a
while only the threat makes people nervous,'' he said. ``After a
while they can wait longer and longer'' between violent acts.
   Dr. Dave Davis, a forensic psychiatrist who works for the Secret
Service, said the letter to WAGA reflected a mind filled with
anger, low self-esteem and a willingness to kill for attention.
   ``He's really a sicko. If I had to take a guess right off I'd
say he was a paranoid person,'' Davis told The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
   The experts said a small group probably was involved, if the
bombings were the work of more than one person.
   ``Most times, you become a terrorist because you have a cause
and nobody will listen to you,'' said Bill Bailey, president of
Threat Management Associates, a Houston security service. ``They're
politically way out of the mainstream. If they do catch them, they
probably will fit around the dining room table.''
   In addition to the fatal bombs, a bomb was intercepted in
Jacksonville, Fla., where Vance was involved in a desegregation
case, and another in Atlanta. All carried Georgia postmarks. The
letter to WAGA had an Atlanta postmark, as did follow-up letters to
victims.
   ``The likelihood, with the way it's been organized, is that
they're a splinter from another group,'' Waugh said. ``These are
ideas that don't just come out of the blue.''
   Pat Clark, director of the Klanwatch operations at the Southern
Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., said Friday that the
organization has identified more than 230 hate groups in the United
States, but none calls itself Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System.
   Jenkins said the theme and language of the letter reflected
racism and xenophobia common to the Ku Klux Klan and its spinoffs.
Klan groups have vehemently denied involvement.
   Jenkins said the only way to stop the threats was to catch those
involved.
   ``One thing we've learned from dealing with terrorists is we can
displace the risk, spread it around,'' Jenkins said. ``But somebody
has to go out there and apprehend the people and put them out of
business.''

<TEXT>
   Panama's Roman Catholic bishops on
Saturday urged the Vatican to hand Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega over
for trial in the United States or Panama, calling him ``the author
of abominable crimes.''
   Noriega, under U.S. indictment for drug trafficking, took refuge
in the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve, four days after the United
States attacked Panamanian military bases and installed a civilian
government.
   ``It is quite justifiably feared that should he be set free in
any part of the world, Mr. Noriega would in a short time be causing
turmoil, conflict and violence in this already long-suffering
nation,'' the bishops said in a letter to Pope John Paul II.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials said troops searching for weapons
caches made a mistake Friday when they searched the Nicaraguan
ambassador's residence.
   A senior U.S. Embassy official said the soldiers left as soon as
they realized they were on diplomatic premises.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government retaliated by ordering
the expulsions of 20 American diplomats and telling the U.S.
Embassy in Managua to cut its support staff. The State Department
called the response an ``overreaction'' designed to reduce the U.S.
presence before elections set for Feb. 25.
   President Bush told reporters in Houston that the search was ``a
screw-up. ... It shouldn't have happened and that's been explained
to the Nicaraguans.''
   In its letter to John Paul, the Panamanian bishop's conference
described Noriega as ``the author of abominable crimes.
   ``The mere possibility that the former general not be taken
before justice provokes justified fear in members of the church,''
the bishops said in the communique, translated into English by
church officials.
   They indicated it did not matter whether he was tried in the
United States or Panama as long as there were guarantees for his
personal and physical safety, the death penalty was excluded and he
received a fair trial.
   The letter defended the practice of political asylum but added,
``this is a very special case.''
   A church source said papal nuncio Sebastian Laboa, the Vatican's
ambassador in Panama, approved the letter.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass on Sunday paraphrased a
communique by the bishops of Panama as saying ``the national
leadership of the Catholic Church and the papal nunciature agreed
to hand over Gen. Noriega shortly.''
   Tass did not say when the communique was released, or if it was
referring to the same one sent to the pope. The report, which could
not be confirmed by any other source, did not specifically say
whether Noriega should be turned over to the United States or to
Panama.
   In Rome, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Noriega could
not be handed over to U.S. authorities but that the Vatican was
urging him to leave the mission on his own.
   If Noriega does so, he can assume U.S. troops surrounding the
mission would arrest him immediately. The troops, posted as close
as 10 feet from the embassy gate, have been searching departing
vehicles for non-diplomatic personnel.
   In response to Vatican protests, U.S. troops Saturday turned off
the loud rap and rock music that they were blasting near the
mission in an apparent attempt to harass Noriega.
   ``I am sympathetic to the papal nuncio's plea that the music was
keeping him awake while Noriega slept,'' the senior U.S. Embassy
official said.
   The U.S. search of Nicaraguan Ambassador Antenor Ferrey's
residence heightened tension with the Sandinista government, which
has long predicted a U.S. invasion in Nicaragua.
   The U.S. Embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
contended the troops did not know the house was a diplomatic
residence. Ferrey said he argued with U.S. troops for 75 minutes
before they went in, asking them to call American diplomatic and
military officials.
   A communique from the Southern Command said the troops had
``good cause'' to make the search based on a tip and that they
thought the Nicaraguan envoy's residence was somewhere else. Ferrey
said the residence was moved to its current location about a year
ago.
   The U.S. official said American troops ``courteously withdrew''
when it was determined the situation was a diplomatic one.
   Troops found caches of assault rifles, anti-tank weapons,
grenades, pistols and ammunition in the house, the military said.
The weapons were not taken.
   The United States has surrounded the embassies of Cuba,
Nicaragua and Libya to prevent Noriega associates from seeking
asylum, but it had not ringed the Nicaraguan envoy's residence.
   The U.S. Embassy official corrected an earlier statement that
Noriega adviser Mike Harari had been arrested. He said agents
arrested someone they thought was Harari but determined it was not
him. It was not immediately clear if the man was released.
   Israel Television, meanwhile, reported that Harari was in
Israel. It cited family sources.
   Panama City's international airport, closed to all but relief
flights since the invasion, will open to commercial traffic on
Sunday with flights by the Panamanian airline COPA, a COPA
spokesman said.
   Also Saturday, U.S. soldiers searched the offices of the Spanish
news agency EFE and several homes in the neighborhood.
   Andreu Claret, the agency's Panama director, later said some of
the soldiers told him they were looking for a suspected looter who
according to neighbors had been hiding in a neighboring house.

   A gas explosion leveled a vacant house and
critically injured a worker investigating reports of a leak in the
area, police and company officials said.
   The injured worker, Jack Sedar of Colonia, was listed in
critical condition in the burn center at St. Barnabas Medical
Center in Livingston following Friday's explosion.
   Sedar and another employee, who was not identified, had gone to
the home of an Elizabethtown Gas Co. customer who reported smelling
fumes, said company spokesman Chris Reardon.
   After discovering gas fumes in several other homes, the second
employee entered a vacant house to investigate, Reardon said.
   An explosion rocked the house, sending its sides outward and on
top of Sedar, who was near the side door, Reardon said. It was not
known what ignited the explosion.
   The other employee was in the basement and suffered only minor
cuts and bruises.
   A preliminary investigation showed the leak was caused by a
crack in an 8-inch main that most likely was caused by shifting
ground, Reardon said.

   The train, made up of a locomotive and four passenger cars, was

<TEXT>
   A U.S. official on Saturday called the
expulsion of 20 U.S. diplomats from Nicaragua ``drastic and
unjustified'' retaliation for a search by U.S. troops of the
Nicaraguan ambassador's home in Panama.
   On Friday night, President Daniel Ortega gave the diplomats 72
hours to leave. He also ordered the mission to reduce its
administrative staff from 320 to 100. Most of those employees are
Nicaraguan nationals.
   ``We were at grave risk of a political-military clash with the
United States, which has maintained an aggressive attitude against
Latin American countries,'' Ortega said.
   The action came after U.S. troops invaded the Nicaraguan
ambassador's house in Panama City despite his protests. A senior
U.S. official in Panama City called the search a mistake and said
troops did not know they were in a diplomatic residence.
   The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said 15 U.S. diplomats would be
allowed to remain in the country, the minimum prescribed by the
Vienna Convention.
   ``The measure of the Sandinista government is drastic and
unjustified,'' said Louis Falino, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy
in Managua who spoke to The Associated Press by telephone. Falino
was on the list of those expelled.
   President Bush said in Houston on Saturday that an apology had
been made.
   ``It's a screw-up and they (U.S. military officials in Panama)
have expressed their regrets that it happened,'' Bush said. He
added that ``it shouldn't have happened and that's been explained
to the Nicaraguans.''
   U.S. officials said soldiers were acting on a tip that a large
cache of weapons was stored at the home. Soldiers returned the
weapons after realizing it was the Nicaraguan diplomat's residence,
the State Department said.
   The search of Ambassador Antenor Ferrey's residence in Panama
City was ``outrageous...insolent'' and ``violated principles of
international law,'' Ortega said.
   ``They acted arrogantly, like Rambos!'' Ortega said.
   He claimed the U.S. soldiers stole more than $2,000 and took
some clothes from the residence. U.S. reaction to the charge was
not immediately available.
   Tension between the two countries increased after the Dec. 20
U.S. invasion of Panama and the overthrow of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega. If it does not ease, it could give Ortega an excuse to
cancel presidential elections set for Feb. 25.
   ``We have never discarded the possibility'' of a U.S. invasion
of Nicaragua,'' said Manuel Rodriguez, political adviser at the
Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama. He spoke before the search, looking
down on U.S. troops manning barricades of wire and sandbags at the
embassy and checking identification on a side street.
   ``It's just that the results would not be the same as in Panama.
It would cost them a lot more.''
   Nicaragua's Soviet-equipped military is the largest force in
Central America.
   The United States has not had an ambassador in Managua since
July 1988, when the leftist Sandinista government expelled
Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other American diplomats to
protest alleged American interference in an opposition rally in
Nicaragua.
   The United States responded by expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador
Carlos Tunnerman.
   U.S. soldiers circled the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama last week
in case Noriega sought refuge there. Nicaragua's Foreign Ministry
then ordered the U.S. Embassy in Managua surrounded.

   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev will become
known as the nicest guy on the ``bloc'' in 1989.
   Get it? Bloc. Block.
   The Procrastinator's Club got it and made several other somewhat
tongue-in-cheek predictions for 1989 Saturday.
   As usual, the procrastinators were very late with their
prognostications and right on the mark.
   ``We're perfect,'' club president Les Waas said Saturday.
``We've never made a mistake yet. I don't know why that is. I guess
because we spend a whole year putting them together.''
   The rich, the famous, the infamous, the political and the sports
inclined will have a rough and rocky 1989, the club said.
   According to the club:
   _Ronald Reagan will become half of a skinhead.
   _Zsa Zsa will slap slap a cop cop.
   _An oil company will try to ``Exxonerate'' itself after a tanker
captain fails to get a designated driver in Alaska.
   _Hotel queen Leona Helmsley will get an additional room paid for
with taxes that only the little people pay.
   _Pete Rose, although becoming known as a ``bettor'' player, will
be hustled out of baseball.
   _The United States will send troops to a Central American
country in search of a pineapple.
   The Procrastinator's Club, established in 1956 by employees at a
Philadelphia advertising agency, has been making its
Johnny-come-lately predictions for at least 20 years, Waas said.
But still the members have trouble convincing folks the club has
high-powered crystal balls.
   ``We go out on a limb. Some of these (predictions) are
unconscionable. Nobody ever believes us. Some of these are pretty
far-fetched,'' Waas said.
   Waas said he has been president, or rather ``acting president,''
of the club since it began.
   ``The nominating committee hasn't reported back yet,'' he said.
``Wouldn't it be somehing if I wasn't made president.''
   The club, which claims 6,500 members worldwide and another half
million who haven't gotten around to joining yet, is currently in
the middle of the 1978 membership drive, Waas said.
   ``That was a dull year. We didn't do much that year,'' he
explained.
   Other 1989 predictions include:
   _Donald Trump will somehow get his name in the paper.
   _Jim Bakker will be rewarded by not having to live with Tammy
Faye for the next 40 years.
   _Jerry Ford will turn out to be right on his statement that
``Poland is not a communist country.''
   _A star named Rob will sink to a new ``Lowe'' when his video
goes national.
   _Millions will go batty over Jack Nicholson.

   A strong earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the
Richter Scale, occurred near the northern coast of Papua New
Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey reported Saturday.
   The tremor occurred at 9:19 a.m. Sunday, local time, or 6:19
p.m. EST Saturday, the federal agency said.
   Donald Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, said
it was not known whether there were any injuries or serious damage.
A quake of similar magnitude in April, 1988 in roughly the same
area did not cause serious injuries or damage, he said.
   The agency said Sunday's tremor occurred near the coast and it's
not known how much of it was on land or in the water.
   The agency's earthquake monitoring facility at Golden, Colo.,
measured the tremor at 6.7 on the Richter scale and placed it at
420 miles northwest of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New
Guinea.
   The area is known to have frequent tremors. Sunday's earthquake
was the strongest in the region since the 6.7 magnitude earthquake
that occurred on April 8, 1988, officials said.

<HEAD>Report: Israel Paid Ceausescu Cash for Jewish Immigrants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel paid thousands of dollars in cash to
Nicolae Ceausescu for every Romanian Jew he allowed to emigrate, an
Israeli newspaper reported.
   For years, Ceausescu received between $5,000 and $7,000 for
every visa issued to Jews, and some $50-$60 million ended up in the
dictator's own pocket, Yediot Aharonot said in its weekend edition.
   Ceausescu was executed on Christmas Day.
   Quoting reliable sources, the paper said official agencies
responsible for immigration in Israel, including the Foreign
Ministry and the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, acknowledged
Ceausescu was paid but would not give specific figures.
   Israeli officials reportedly knew of the payoffs for years, but
they dared not expose or publicize it for fear it would halt
immigration from Romania, Yediot said.
   ``Our interest was the protection of the Jews in Romania and not
what kind of dictator Ceausescu was,'' the paper quoted an
unidentified official involved in the deals as saying.
   According to the paper, the money given Ceausescu was raised by
various Jewish organizations. It said reliable sources in the U.S.
Jewish community had confirmed that Ceausescu received the money
for the past 20 years.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post said the money was handed
over in suitcases filled with U.S. dollars.
   The head of the Immigration Committee in the Knesset, or
parliament, Michael Kliner, told Yediot that helping bring Romanian
Jews to Israel meant saving lives and therefore ``all necessary
steps were kosher.''
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, Motti Amichai, said the
ministry knew of no such deals with Romania.
   Repeated telephone calls to the spokesman for the Jewish Agency
went unanswered.
   On Wednesday, Israel announced its support of the new Bucharest
regime but refrained from personally criticizing Ceausescu, who had
been highly regarded here for maintaining a longstanding alliance
with the Jewish state.
   Ceasescu was the only East bloc leader to maintain ties with
Israel after the 1967 Middle East war, when others broke links and
sided with the Arabs.
   About 400,000 Romanians have immigrated to Israel since its
founding in 1948 and some 1,500 have immigrated each year for the
past 10 years.

   A 5-year-old Texas boy was accidentally
left at a service station when his family got back on the highway
and didn't noticed his absence until stopping for dinner two hours
later.
   ``This is embarrassing, but I'm glad he's safe,'' said his
father, Glenn Payne. ``We've all had a scare this evening.''
   Tyler Payne got out of the family's station wagon to use the
restroom Friday afternoon, then couldn't get out of the building
because the door had become stuck.
   Meanwhile, his family headed for Texas.
   Two hours and over 100 miles later, his parents, five brothers
and a sister stopped at a restaurant in Jackson, Tenn., and noticed
Tyler was missing.
   Back in Nashville, Tyler had been freed by a woman who heard him
shouting.
   The boy spent the next few hours with detectives, who amused him
with teddy bears, coloring books and candy.
   The Paynes had spent Christmas with Kris Payne's parents in
Knoxville and were on their way home to Weatherford, Texas, when
they stopped at the service station.
   ``We normally have a head count, but this time we didn't,''
Payne said. ``We were tired.''

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel toured his vast
presidential home on Saturday and placed flowers at the statue of
St. Wenceslas to honor political prisoners who fought for change.
   The playwright who spent five years in prison for dissident
activities used his first full day as the country's first
non-Communist president in 48 years to pay tribute to the
casualties of the movement he helped lead.
   He also met with President Mario Soares of Portugal, also a
former political prisoner and the first head of state to visit the
new president.
   Havel and Premier Marian Calfa appointed a non-Communist
interior minister. Government television said the appointee,
Richard Sacher, is a member of the People's Party, which was once
allied with the Communist Party but has become increasingly
independent in the wake of the country's peaceful revolution.
   The new president toured the medieval Hradcany Castle, where the
presidential office and residence overlooks the city.
   ``Havel took stock of the premises with which he is not very
well acquainted,'' said Michael Zantovsky, a spokesman for the
group Civic Forum, which led the revolution.
   Havel met for the first time with some members of the staff, who
just a few weeks ago were employed by Gustav Husak, the hard-line
Communist president. Husak served 21 years and was ousted Dec. 10
by the pro-democracy revolution.
   Havel has said he will serve as Czechoslovakia's ninth president
only until April, when the first free elections in four decades are
to be held.
   Havel was accompanied to the statue of Bohemia's patron saint by
Soares, who was jailed for battling a right-wing government.
   Soares, recognized by the United Nations for his human rights
work, returned to Lisbon after the 1974 revolution overturned
Portugal's 48-year-old regime.
   ``Havel and Soares wanted to remember the last five weeks in
Czecholovakia and to express their solidarity with students and
others who have been beaten or harassed and who were working for a
day such as this,'' said student leader Simon Panek, who attended
the brief ceremony under gray winter skies.
   Soares arrived in Czechoslovakia on Wednesday on an informal
visit to last several days.
   Later, Havel held a brief informal meeting with his new reform
government at the Vikarka Pub inside the walls of the castle,
according to a friend of the president's who asked not to be
identified.
   Havel was unanimously elected Friday by the Communist-dominated
Parliament. By early evening, Prague's beautiful streets were
filled with people celebrating their victory over the Communist
regime. The party lasted until early Saturday. Thousands danced in
the cobbled streets to the strains of Bohemian violins or electric
guitars.
   Men in feathered Moravian hats toasted Havel's health with mugs
of Pilsner beer under a giant Christmas tree in the center of the
square.
   At a nearby bar, several men identifying themselves as former
Husak bodyguards gave away bullets.
   ``We don't have guns anymore, but we have a few bullets left,''
said one burly man.
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday offered congratulations to
Czechoslovakia's new leaders.
   In a telegram to Czechoslovakia's Roman Catholic primate,
Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek, the pope hailed the ``great and
significant moments in the life of your noble republic.''
   He expressed hope the election of Havel as president and
Alexander Dubcek as chairman of the legislature marks ``a decisive
step toward peace and prosperity in freedom and in the path of (the
country's) ancient Christian traditions.''
   Dubcek was the Communist Party chief who was ousted after he
instituted liberal reforms that were crushed by a military invasion
in 1968.

<HEAD>Lawyer: Domino's Pizza Driver Calls Boss After Wreck to Make Delivery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Domino's Pizza driver who hit another
motorist while making a delivery called his boss and had him come
and get the pie to meet the company's 30-minute guarantee, a lawyer
claims in a negligence lawsuit.
   Ramon Rigal says he suffered back injuries and a concussion when
his Chevrolet Blazer, which was stopped for a turn, was struck from
behind by a Volkswagen driven by a 19-year-old Domino's delivery
man. Police say the April accident caused $9,000 damage to the two
cars.
   ``After the crash, the pizza man calls his boss, who shows up to
take the handoff of the pizza and finish the delivery,'' attorney
Paul Nelson said in an interview Friday.
   The Rigals ``are out there waiting for the paramedics to come,
and all they do is hand off this pizza,'' Nelson said, blaming the
accident on Domino's policy of guaranteeing pizza delivery in 30
minutes or giving customers $3 off their bill.
   Rigal, a commercial artist, is unable to work and on the verge
of bankruptcy, Nelson said. The amount of damages Rigal is seeking
wasn't specified.
   Domino's refused to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in
Hillsborough Circuit Court last month.
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of actions blaming a
traffic accident on a Domino's delivery driver rushing to meet the
half-hour deadline. Seven such lawsuits have been filed against the
pizza maker in the last two years in Hillsborough County, and four
have been filed in the last few years in Pinellas Circuit Court in
neighboring St. Petersburg.
   Ron Hingst, director of public relations for Domino's,
emphasizes that drivers aren't penalized if they take longer than
30 minutes. ``The $3 doesn't come out of the driver's pocket; it's
built into the budget of each store.''

   More than 700 passengers on a day-cruise
casino vessel were dealt a bad hand when dense fog prevented them
from returning to port for 28 hours.
   Weary and disheveled passengers lined the Pride of Mississippi's
rails and cheered Friday afternoon as deckhands tossed lines ashore
and ended what was supposed to have been an eight-hour excursion
into the Gulf of Mexico.
   Some passengers cursed Pride Cruise Lines for taking them out on
a foggy day, but others said they had a ball.
   ``It was real nice,'' said Gerald Shelton, a Houston landscaper,
who was with his wife, Bonnie, and son, Gerald, 12. ``They took
real good care of us. I lost a little bit, but I didn't mind being
stuck out there.''
   Tracy Pekovsky of Washington, D.C., said the trip was ``a
nightmare.''
   ``It was foggy when we left the channel and they should never,
ever have taken us out,'' she said.
   ``They need to go and take a look at some other cruise lines,''
said Renee Banks of Houston. ``Even down to a Coke, they were
charging for everything. We had a cabin but there were people
wandering around wondering where they could get a blanket or a
pillow from. I never heard any announcement. To me, that's a little
tacky.''
   Chief Purser Murdock MacRae said he made several announcements
Thursday night, but some people may not have heard them because of
noise in the lounges or casino.
   ``With 744 passengers, there are going to be a few
complainers,'' he said. The vessel stayed in international waters
all night, allowing the casino to remain open, passengers said.
Cruise officials said bands, vocalists and other entertainers
worked throughout the trip and movies played continuously.
   The cruise got off to a bad start when it left three hours late
on Thursday and had a minor collision with a shrimp boat in the
port. There were no injuries.
   Hours later, fog banks shrouded the vessel.

   The Navy is ``seriously considering'' limiting
purchases of its prized $1.2 billion Trident submarine to every
other year in reaction to intense budget pressures for the new
fiscal year, a senior Pentagon official says.
   The service also is proposing to put two of its four battleships
in mothballs as it fights to retain at least 14 aircraft carriers.
   President Bush is scheduled to deliver his 1991 budget to
Congress on Jan. 22, and he may be called upon to make the final
calls on the controversial suggestions.
   ``We're robbing Peter to pay Paul,'' the Pentagon official said
of the current budget-juggling exercise. He spoke on condition of

   The Drug Enforcement Administration, rejecting
a recommendation of its own chief judge, has refused to relax
restrictions on marijuana.
   The order by Administrator John C. Lawn, published Friday in the
Federal Register, means that marijuana will continue to be listed
under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, for substances
with a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical
application, where it has been classified since the act was passed
in 1970.
   NORML, the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform,
petitioned three years ago to have the substance reclassified to
Schedule II, meaning it would remain unavailable to the general
public but could be prescribed by doctors for limited purposes.
   The DEA's chief administrative law judge, Francis L. Young,
recommended Sept. 6, 1988, that marijuana be placed on the less
restrictive schedule, calling it ``one of the safest
therapeutically active substances known to man.''

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's decision to
close an internal investigation into a news leak about an FBI probe
of Rep. William H. Gray III's office got a sharp rebuke from Gray
and from Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., who says the leak investigation
should continue.
   Thornburgh wrote Biden, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman,
that investigators had been ``unable to identify with certainty the
original source'' of disclosures to CBS reporter Rita Braver about
Gray's office financial affairs and therefore will not prosecute or
fire anyone.
   The leak occurred at the end of May while Gray, D-Pa., was
seeking election in the House as majority whip, and it prompted
accusations from Democratic lawmakers that Thornburgh's aides were
the source of a political leak.
   Thornburgh said in Friday's letter to Biden, D-Del., that
investigators also told him ``the nature of the confirmations
alleged to have been forthcoming to Ms. Braver'' were ``uncertain.''

   The Federal Communications Commission is
investigating claims that some companies are charging backyard
satellite dish owners as much as 20 times more than cable systems
for the same TV programs.
   The FCC said Friday it had ``disturbing evidence'' that cable
operators were receiving preferential treatment from satellite
carriers for the programs cable operators provide by coaxial cable
to their subscribers.
   ``Because this evidence raises serious concerns about the
competitive nature of this market and the impact on consumers,''
the commission said it would conduct an inquiry into the matter to
determine if remedies were needed to protect the nation's 2.5
million dish owners.
   ``This is a great victory,'' said Larry Helland, attorney for
the Valhalla, N.Y.-based American Home Satellite Association.
Helland said the new FCC inquiry finally would force satellite
companies to justify their rates to backyard dish owners.
