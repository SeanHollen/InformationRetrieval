   The jury in Leona Helmsley's tax evasion trial
ended a third day of deliberations without a verdict Monday after
rehearing testimony from liquor salesmen who said they gave
kickbacks to the hotel magnate.
   The jurors in Manhattan's federal court deliberated 8{ hours in
the third day of discussions. They had deliberated about 15 hours
over the weekend.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is charged with evading $1.2 million in
federal taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations
at her Connecticut mansion, to her businesses.
   Her co-defendants, former aides Turco and Joseph Licari, are
charged with assisting in the scheme.
   Mrs. Helmsley is charged with 41 of the 47 counts in the
indictment, including conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service, tax evasion, signing false personal returns, aiding in the
filing of false corporate returns, mail fraud and extortion
conspiracy.
   The panel on Monday asked to rehear testimony from two liquor
salesmen who testified that they were forced to kick back a
percentage of their sales to keep accounts at Helmsley hotels.
   The testimony relates to the most serious charge against Mrs.
Helmsley, conspiracy to commit extortion, which carries a 20-year
prison sentence upon conviction.
   The jurors also asked to hear the portion of her attorney's
closing argument which described the payments as rebates and the
prosecutor's rebuttal on that issue.
   Judge John Walker Jr., however, told them they could not hear the
closing arguments because they are not considered evidence.
   The jury has been sequestered since closing arguments began
Wednesday. They heard from 44 prosecution witnesses and four defense
witnesses during the two-month trial.

   A sixth man was arrested and charged Monday in
connection with the shooting death of a 16-year-old black youth who
police said was attacked by a bat-wielding gang of whites in
Brooklyn.
   Joseph Serrano, 20, surrendered to detectives and was charged
with first-degree assault, first-degree riot, aggravated harassment,
menacing and civil rights violations, said Officer Edward Feeney, a
police spokesman.
   In the neighborhood of Bensonhurst, meanwhile, where Yusef
Hawkins was shot to death Wednesday night, there were signs that
tempers were cooling off following two days of racial confrontations.
   About a dozen blacks led about 150 white residents on a short
walk through the streets where the killing occurred. Dozens of
people, angry over a third day of demonstrations in their
neighborhood, stood facing the demonstrators but were quieter and
less confrontational than residents of the predominantly white
community had been Saturday and Sunday.
   Before the start of the march, seven Catholic priests gathered on
a street corner and led about 75 Bensonhurst residents in prayer.
   The Rev. Arthur Minichello, a local pastor, said they were
praying for the family of the victim.
   ``This is the community of Bensonhurst, not the idiots that are
down the block,'' said 26-year-old James Tancredi.
   Police are also investigating whether a seventh man who could be
a suspect in the shooting on Wednesday may have fled to Italy, The
New York Times reported in its Tuesday editions.
   Detectives, however, still believe that 18-year-old Joseph Fama,
whose parents were born in Italy and who holds dual American and
Italian citizenship, remains in the United States, the newspaper
said.
   Fama was identified by a witness as the triggerman in the attack.
   In a related development Monday, a 22-year-old construction
worker was freed on bail after pleading innocent to charges he tried
to intimidate the woman who authorities believe may have
precipitated the attack by befriending the black youths.
   Cosmo Camia of Brooklyn, was arrested Saturday after he twice
drove by the home of Gina Feliciano and allegedly yelled threats.
Camia, charged with two felony counts of intimidating a witness and
two counts of harassment, both violations, faces up to four years in
prison on each of the intimidation charges.
   Apart from Serrano, Kenneth Mondello, 18, Pasquale Raucci, 19,
Charles Stressler, 21, Steven Curreri, 18, and James Patino, 24,
were charged in the attack. The five men were freed on bail over the
weekend.

<HEAD>Christian Group Rides The Waves For Jesus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Surfing, long associated with
Gidget, the Beach Boys and empty-headed frivolity, is being used by
some young Christians to spread the Gospel.
   ``We like to call it surfing for Jesus,'' said James Gould, a
youth counselor at a Christian ministry in Fort Lauderdale. ``I'm
sure the Lord approves.''
   The Calvary Chapel Surfing Association _ now with about 70
members throughout south Florida _ intends to incorporate Christian
teachings into the youth culture of surfing, Gould said.
   ``There's still a drug problem with some of our kids,'' said
Gould. ``But mostly we have just good, Christian kids who happen to
surf. Surfing has always had a bad rap.''
   For the past year, the group has met once a month on a beach for
Bible readings and prayer. A sign says they are ``ambassadors of
Christ.''
   The final prayer, said Gould, is for a good set of waves and
protection from sharks.
   ``I don't think it's God's will that anyone be attacked by a
shark, but if it is, then it is,'' said Gould, 33, who has been
surfing seriously for about three years. ``God created the beach,
the waves and the sky. There's a special spiritual feeling being out
there waiting for a wave.''
   In Gould's small office at the chapel a mile from the beach,
crosses and religious symbols hang next to photographs and surfing
trinkets such as a figurine of Garfield the cartoon cat riding a
wave.
   One of Gould's boards has the decal ``Jesus: Team USA.''
   ``You just have to say we are Christ's ambassadors ... to the
surfing scene,'' said Gould.
   Rob Craft, 17, said, ``The surfing is what got me into all this.
I never thought of mixing church and surfing, but you can really do
it.''
   But there are some who do not make the connection.
   Willie Smith said an air-brush painter balked at writing ``Jesus
Rules'' on Smith's board. Andre LeTast said others just turn a deaf
ear.
   ``Sometime they say, `Get away from me, I don't want to hear that
Jesus stuff,''' he said. ``But I think deeply of him. He's always
with me and I want other people to know he can be with them, too.''
   The idea of surfing for Jesus began in the mid-1980s in a Calvary
Chapel church in Costa Mesa, Calif., which has taped telephone
messages to tell members about the next surfing contests.
   Up the coast in Ventura, Calif., professional surfer Chris Burke
is organizing Christian surf retreats for youths in Mazatlan,
Mexico. The first camp this year had 50 participants, and the next
four are sold out, said Burke. Next September, Surfers for Missions
International is planning a retreat in Tahiti.
   ``When I was growing up surfing there was nothing like this. You
know, it was the laid-back, laissez-faire attitude,'' said Burke,
24, a member of the U.S. amateur team from 1984 to 1986. ``It just
sort of hit me that I could use surfing as a way to evangelize.''
   Gould said he believes if Jesus were a late-20th century figure
he would be a surfer or a rock musician and take part in other
youth-oriented activities to help teens with problems of drugs and
alienation.
   ``Jesus would probably not even use a board,'' said Gould. ``He'd
probably get out there and ride the waves in his bare feet.''

NOTE _ In coming months, Congress must decide whether the B-2 ``stealth
bomber,'' the most expensive plane ever designed and built, is a weapon
the United States can't afford to do without, or simply can't afford. Yet
for all the secrecy surrounding this high-tech marvel, the ideas behind
it are, by aviation standards, almost ancient history.    ___</BYLINE>

   It rests, in pieces, in a grimy corner of a
museum warehouse in suburban Silver Hill, Md., long forgotten by the
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable
bomber in the skies.
   Re-assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or a
stub-tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that the
enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet-powered flying wing's
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves,
rather than reflect them.
   No, the Northrop B-2 bomber, the world's most expensive airplane,
hasn't already become a dust-gathering relic _ although some
critics, convinced the albatross is the only sea-creature to which
it should be compared, wish that were so.
   The astonishing lookalike in Silver Hill is indeed a stealth
warplane, but it was secretly built and test-flown 45 years ago by
Nazi Germany.
   For all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word ``stealth''
since it was introduced to the U.S. military vocabulary in 1980, the
B-2 and such radar-evading relatives as the F-117A fighter represent
concepts which, by aviation standards, are almost ancient.
   The B-2 has been financed, until this year, out of the Pentagon's
mysterious ``black'' budget. For eight years, the taxpayers spent
$22.4 billion without knowing it, and without knowing what they were
getting for it.
   What they got, when it was finally nosed heavenward in July, was
a strange, plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably
won't fly much higher, much farther or any faster than the Strategic
Air Command's old reliable, the B-52.
   The B-2 is 17 feet tall, 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172
feet. It is powered by four General Electric F-118 engines,
virtually the same engines as used on the F-14 fighter but without
afterburners. Its range is 6,900 miles without refueling, and 11,500
miles with one midair refueling. It will have a maximum takeoff
weight of 350,000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of
bombs or missiles, nuclear or conventional, 10,000 pounds less than
the B-52. Private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to
55,000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 0.8 to 0.85, or about 530-560
mph.
   There's nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers.
What is dazzling, presumably, is the stuff the Air Force won't talk
about _ the stealth technology, computerized flight controls,
``quiet'' on-board radar, and other electronic systems, possibly
employing fiber optics, designed to withstand the electromagnetic
interference generated by nuclear blasts.
   The Air Force wants to spend an additional $50 billion or so to
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company, Northrop, which for
years hadn't made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter, the
F-5.
   Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello, who left as
undersecretary of defense in May, wanted to scuttle the program. In
an interview with The Washington Post, he said he told then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci last year that ``it's being brought to you
by the same company that brought you'' a series of troubled
programs, including guidance systems for the MX and air-launched
cruise missiles. ``What makes you think they'll do better (with the
B-2)?''
   Eight days after the B-2's maiden flight July 17, Pentagon and
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by
the Justice Department's fraud unit concerning Northrop's billing
practices on the project. The company said it was unaware of the
probe.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones says without reservation that
the B-2 is an ``extraordinary'' success. Defense Secretary Richard
B. Cheney calls it ``absolutely vital'' to strategic deterrence.
President Bush says doing without it would be ``devastating'' to
arms-control negotiations with the Soviets.
   The security and secrecy surrounding the project have been
phenomenal, perhaps rivaled only by elements of the Star Wars
program and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb in
World War II. Northrop removed it from the rest of its own
organization, forming a new division called Advanced Products and
housing it at a closed auto plant in Pico Rivera, Calif. It
surrounded the plant, as well as the sister assembly complex at
Palmdale, Calif., with fences topped by razor wire.
   According to Costello, security has accounted for 5 percent of
the costs to date. With more than $22.4 billion spent so far, that
amounts to more than $1 billion.
   The tight security imposed additional costs. Efficiency suffered
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didn't know
what their subordinates were doing. ``I couldn't even ask,'' one
former Northrop official told the Los Angeles Times last year. ``For
all I knew, they were going to the movies every day.''
   Some could have. When employees were hired, they could not go
directly to work until their security clearances were finished. Many
were assigned for weeks to make-work jobs in an area of the plant
they nicknamed the ``drunk tank.''
   Unbeknownst to the public, the biggest snag occurred halfway
through the seven-year design period when the Air Force changed its
mind about the B-2's mission. The Pentagon originally ordered a
high-altitude bomber. Now it wanted one that could penetrate at low
levels as well, probably because it was fearful the Soviet Union was
developing the same new radar technology, called OTHB for Over the
Horizon Backscatter. The still super-secret radar system, the
Pentagon has privately acknowledged, offers new possibilities for
detecting stealth airplanes, though it is said to be ineffective
within 500 miles.
   Northrop's designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower
altitudes, where turbulence is greater. That took a year and another
$1 billion. An additional six-month delay was necessary for other
design changes, related especially to the engine inlets. In 1987,
two years before Congress began public debate over funding for the
B-2, the Pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years
in the face of Gramm-Rudman budget restrictions. Cheney has
postponed production yet another year; the Pentagon now hopes to
build all 132 planes by 1999, versus the original target of 1995.

<TEXT>
   In 1986, then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger offered no
hint of the design delays and escalating costs when he testified
before Congress that the program ``is on schedule; the technology is
well-understood and working, and we expect the system to be
operational in the early 1990s.''
   Weinberger was also far off the mark when he offered Congress the
first public figures about the plane's cost. The B-2, he said, would
cost $277 million for each plane, and the entire program would tally
about $36.6 billion. Just two years later, the Pentagon went back to
Congress, weeks before the B-2's first test flight, with figures
roughly doubling Weinberger's: $530 million per plane, total program
cost of more than $70 billion.
   With those numbers now out in the open, some in Congress are
questioning whether the United States can afford the plane that Gen.
Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command, calls
nothing less than ``a quantum leap into the 21st century.''
   For all the secrecy surrounding the B-2's high-tech features,
there is no dark secret about either the stealth concept itself or
the flying-wing design. Each is nearly as old as powered flight.
   Simply put, the stealthiness of an airplane, or any other weapons
system, is measured by its ability to thwart an enemy's capacity to
detect it, by whatever means. It is a matter of degree _ there is no
such thing as total stealth; pure invisibility remains the exclusive
domain of science fiction.
   Hauptmann Petrocz von Petroczy probably qualified as the inventor
of the stealth airplane when, at a time when the unaided human eye
was the principal aerial tracking device, he removed the fabric
covering of an Etrich Taube monoplane and replaced it with
transparent celluloid. The engine and skeleton still showed, but
residents of the Austrian countryside had to strain to make out the
wraith-like source of the noise generated by Petroczy's test flights.
   That was in 1912, two years before an Englishman, John W. Dunne,
took to the skies in an airplane with no tail, no fuselage _ the
first flying wing. Aircraft designers, from Hugo Junkers to John W.
Northrop, have been entranced by its possibilities, despite repeated
setbacks, ever since.

   The first ``stealth'' test of Northrop's
flying-wing jet bomber was a remarkable success. Trouble was, four
decades ago, nobody much cared.
   Shortly before the Air Force canceled its order for the strange
YB-49, the late 1940s forerunner to the B-2, Northrop test pilot Max
Skelton flew a grand tour of air defense stations in the West.
   ``Nobody found him _ until he was directly overhead,'' says
flying-wing historian Tim Wooldridge of the National Air and Space
Museum. ``So even then, the Air Force knew that that kind of
airplane was difficult to detect. The sad part is that they didn't
continue the testing.''
   Eventually, the lesson began to take hold, though the Air Force
still wouldn't bring itself to embrace the flying-wing design for
decades. Speed and manueverability remained paramount objectives
through the 1950s and '60s, though stealthiness gradually moved
higher on the priority list.
   Despite representations of the B-2 and its fighter counterpart,
the F-117A, as the only stealth aircraft in the world, the
anti-radar technology has been honed and shared by many other planes
in the U.S. arsenal, some of which remain even more secret than the
B-2 itself. The aging U-2 spy plane and its successor, the SR-71
Blackbird, featured composite coatings. The B-1 and the F-117A
represent advances in wing and body blending as well as the
radar-absorbent materials on their skins.
   Contrary to popular belief, the marriage of stealth technology
with the flying wing, with its slender and hence naturally stealthy
profile, also goes back decades, dating almost to the birth of radar.
   Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the British radar pioneer, said as early
as 1935 that the aerial defense applications of his new technology
could be stymied by future bombers designed to reduce their radar
reflectivity. He and other engineers recognized that stealth would
have not so much to do with the size of the airplane, but with its
shape and the materials used to cover it.
   In World War II, as the United States and Great Britain
aggressively improved radar technology, German scientists led the
way in exploring methods to counter it _ including coatings designed
to absorb, rather than reflect, radar energy. These radar-absorbent
materials, or RAM for short, were first used to shield the snorkels
of German submarines from detection by radar-equipped aircraft. Too
late, really, the engineers turned their attention to their own
aircraft.
   Almost by happenstance, Britain had already delivered a painful
lesson to the Third Reich about bombers and stealth technology.
Early in the war, the tiny de Havilland Company had answered the
panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a
cheap, two-engine machine out of plywood, spruce and balsa. It was
initially scoffed at, but the Mosquito, which carried nary a
defensive gun, had the lowest loss rate of any World War II bomber
thanks to its speed, flying altitude and the nearly invisible
flicker it produced on radar screens.
   That lesson in mind, the brothers Walter and Reimar Horten,
working with a super-secret Luftwaffe group known as Sonderkommando
9, set out to build a super-Mosquito, one even stranger in design.
They came up with a flying wing, powered by two jet enginesburied
behind the cockpit. But too late: The HoIX, the only prototype to
fly, in early 1945, was destroyed when one of the engines failed; a
never-flown copy rests at the National Air and Space Museum's
storage complex at Silver Hill, Md.
   ``It is a remarkably clean-looking airplane,'' says Wooldridge, a
museum official and the author of ``Winged Wonders: The Story of
Flying Wings.''
   The test models were covered with plywood, but production
versions were to have a skin mixing plywood, sawdust, charcoal and
glue _ a compound expressly intended to absorb radar waves. The
Hortens had built a high-load-bearing plane combining jet power, the
low-profile shape of the flying wing and integral RAM. It was the
B-2 of its day.
   More frightening to contemplate is how the war might have turned
if Germany had managed to deploy a larger model that the Hortens had
actually started to assemble in April 1945, the HoXVIII. It was an
enormous, six-jet flying-wing bomber, designed to fly at least 7,400
miles with an 8,000-pound bombload. Were it not for Hitler's
imminent defeat, that aircraft, rivaling the size of the B-2, might
have flown to bomb New York City or Washington.
   Unlike Germany's rocket scientists, the Horten brothers were
rebuffed in their bid to pursue their breakthroughs for the Allies
after the war. Most U.S. warplane manufacturers focused on the
obvious alternatives to stealth for making their craft less
vulnerable _ more speed, higher altitudes, heavier armor and
on-board defenses.
   Meanwhile, Jack Northrop, the founder and longtime design leader
of the California company that bears his name, waged a lonely
campaign for something entirely different _ though the Horten
brothers, headed for virtual exile in Argentina, would not have
thought it so.

   BAGH-E-MAIDAN, Afghanistan (AP) _ Convoys of trucks headed from
the Soviet border to Kabul roll down the Salang Highway, past the
bombed-out villages of an 11-year war that has changed forever the
landscape of this rugged country.
   The war between the Marxistgovernment and the U.S.-backed
guerrillas is reflected in almost every turn.
   A recent trip along a section of the road showed that guerrillas
haven't yet carried out their pledge to cut the strategic link
between the Soviet Union and the Afghan capital.
   Heavily laden trucks of every vintage were rumbling south from
Hairatan, just across the Oxus River from the Soviet Union, carrying
ammunition, fuel, wheat and other goods to Kabul.
   Vehicles loaded with food, supplies and even a yellow-and-white
Kabul taxi were heading north on the 260-mile journey back to the
Soviet border.
   Every day, almost 800 trucks travel along the Salang in both
directions and sometimes as many as 1,000, said Col. Barakat Ullah,
deputy regional commander south of the Salang pass.
   He said guerrillas tried unsuccessfully to cut the Salang after
the last Soviet troops rolled up the highway on Feb. 15, ending
their near decade-long involvement in the war.
   But for the last five months, there has been only sporadic
shelling around this post, which is 16 miles south of the Salang
Tunnel and about 60 miles north of Kabul, he said.
   During the trip, there were no sounds of hostile gunfire in this
strategically important area overlooking the Hindu Kush Mountains,
which is heavily infiltrated with guerrillas.
   A vanload of local Afghans provided the only real noise, firing
their rifles into the air in a traditional welcome for the
journalists as they rode on top of three armored personnel carriers
through the town of Jabalassaraj, about 50 miles north of Kabul.
   Barakat said the guerrillas were feuding among themselves and
were too weak to attack. The government has made deals with most
local guerrilla commanders not to attack the convoys and in the past
two months, 600 guerrillas in the area have switched their support
to the government, he said.
   Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani, head of the fundamentalist
Jamiat-E-Islami guerrilla group, said late last month that
Pakistan-based rebels were trying to develop a coordinated strategy
to cut all major roads in Afghanistan.
   Right now, the Salang, the most hotly contested road of the war,
is the only major highway operating with a semblance of normalcy.
   The two other major roads out of Kabul have more serious
problems: The Jalalabad road running southeast from Kabul to the
Pakistani border is open, but mainly to military traffic and a
limited amount of civilian vehicles which travel under military
escort.
   The Logar and Ghazni roads running south to Pakistan have been
closed for more than a month, cutting off supplies of wheat and
produce to the open market in Kabul and sending prices soaring.
   The guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic Holy
Warriors, said they want even higher prices to force Kabul residents
to evacuate so they can attack the city.
   But as long as the Salang stays open, a total blockade is
impossible.
   In the past three weeks, the government's stockpile of wheat in
the Kabul silo has grown from 8,000 metric tons to 27,000 metric
tons, well-informed sources said.
   Most was shipped down the Salang by truck from Hairatan, but some
was flown to Kabul by Soviet transport planes, which arrive on an
average of about 30 per day. The wheat is crucial to avoiding a
repetition of last winter's shortages.
   Even though the military appeared relatively confident, soldiers
along the highway were reinforcing posts and building new security
areas where sheep once roamed and wild grass grew.
   Dozens of tanks were poised to fire and soldiers stood on
commanding hilltop positions along the mountainous road which
Barakat said the government established after the Soviet withdrawal.
   During the war, dozens of once thriving hillside villages were
caught in crossfire. In the final stages of the Soviet withdrawal,
they were finally reduced to rubble in a combined Afghan-Soviet
sweep to ensure that guerrillas would not use them to fire on the
departing convoys.
   Like the blackened of tankers and trucks littering the sides of
the road and the banks of the Salang River running alongside, they
are reminders that the scars of war will last long after the
fighting ends.

   RAMSTEIN, West Germany _ Thomas Wenzel says a broken watch that
belonged to his fiance is forever frozen at a most chilling time:
the exact moment she died.
   Karin Schneider was among thousands of people who flocked to the
Ramstein U.S. Air Base one year ago to watch a spectacular air show.
She was among 70 who died when a flaming jet plunged into the
horrified crowd.
   ``I have to learn to forget, but I can't because of Karin,'' says
Wenzel, 24, a university student from the nearby village of
Erfenbac. ``I ask myself over and over whether she suffered for a
long time or whether she died instantly.
   ``Only her pocketbook and watch are left. The watch stopped at
the exact second of her death. It was 3:45 in the afternoon.''
   It was Sunday, Aug. 28, 1988. An elite team of 10 Italian stunt
flyers were executing a complex move for the thrilled masses below.
Two aircraft suddenly collided, then a third.
   All crashed, with one sleek jet bursting into a fireball and
rocketing downward into the crowd below.
   The three pilots were among the dead. At least 450 were injured.
   Since then, the Ramstein disaster has prompted a national debate
over air safety.
   Some critics insist rescue efforts were bungled by lack of
coordination between West German and U.S. authorities.
   Others use the tragedy to build their case against low-flying
aircraft in West Germany, the bulwark of the U.S. military presence
in Western Europe. But American and other NATO officers point out
that the Italian Frecce Tricolori team was a stunt-flying group that
had nothing to do with low-level flights.
   ``Never Again'' and ``Stop Low-Level Flights'' read some of the
banners during an Aug. 13 protest march sponsored by a leftist group
called ``Let Us Not Forget.'' The demonstrators, about 1,000 of
them, carried 70 crucifixes symbolizing the dead.
   Later the group watched a mock hearing, complete with five-member
jury, that severely criticized West German and U.S. officials
involved in planning the air show that attracted more than 300,000
people.
   One of those who ``testified'' was Edna Kreutzer, who complained
that officials are refusing to compensate her for the lost wages she
was expecting from her 23-year-old son, Aloysius, one of the 61 West
Germans killed.
   ``He was a miner with a good job and he made a lot of money,''
the 52-year-old Saarland woman said later. She works nights bundling
newspapers to help make ends meet.
   The ZDF television network says officials have received 1,500
claims for compensation, but that so far only half of them have been
settled. It said $8.1 million has been paid out, but that the total
sum will be several times higher.
   Wenzel told The Associated Press his injuries were limited to
seared lungs and singed hair, even though he was standing near Karin
at the time of the crash. Many other survivors suffered nearly
incapacitating burns.
   In Bonn, conservative lawmakers are at odds with the leftist
Social Democrats over the direction of a special commission that has
been investigating the crash. But the Social Democrats brush off the
criticism that it is using the commission in hopes of exploiting
anti-military sentiment in next year's national elections.
   ``We want to be sure that Ramstein never occurs again,'' said
Social Democrat defense expert Erwin Horn.
   As part of the observances for the anniversary, NATO nations are
grounding all military missions in the normally crowded skies over
West Germany on Monday.
   The U.S. Air Force held an anniversary remembrance for the
victims, including the four Americans who died, on Friday at the
sprawling Ramstein base.
   West German state lawmakers planned an ecumenical prayer service
for Sunday in Ramstein.
   And the Italian stunt team planned to make its first appearance
since the disaster, performing at an air show in Belgium on Sunday.

   Rivalries between Hispanics and other Americans have
crowded out issues in the tight, emotion-charged race for the U.S.
House seat left vacant by the death of Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Voting Tuesday is expected to be by ethnic, more than party,
lines, with Hispanics rallying around a Havana-born woman trying to
become the first Cuban-American in Congress, and most non-Latin
whites and blacks turning out for a Brooklyn-born, Jewish attorney.
That scenario, indicated in polling, would result in a photo-finish
race.
   While Pepper, a national advocate for the elderly and poor who
died May 30 at age 88, overwhelmed opponents for 27 years _ and drew
no opposition last year _ Tuesday's special election is the
culmination of one of the most bitter campaigns Florida has seen.
   Attorney Gerald Richman, making his first run for elective
office, defied political pundits and his own party's local hierarchy
by winning the Democratic nomination by a landslide in an Aug. 15
runoff.
   GOP nominee Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a state senator, put together a
well-organized, well-funded campaign featuring appearances by
President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle.
   The president's son, Jeb Bush, is her campaign chairman and the
Republican Party is trying to add to its momentum in Florida and
increase its 10-8 majority in the congressional delegation.
   However, Richman charged charged from Democratic dark horse to
running neck-and-neck with Ms. Ros-Lehtinen in a campaign in which
he repeatedly said ``this is an American seat.'' He called Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen a right-wing extremist.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said Richman was running a campaign of racism
and bigotry and she refused to debate him during their two-week
campaign.
   Richman, whose thin, inexperienced campaign staff was beefed up
by national party help after his nomination, said his theme has been
``for all the people,'' and that the ``American seat'' comment means
voters shouldn't choose by place of birth.
   It was Republican national leader Lee Atwater who set the tone by
saying the party wanted to elect a Cuban-American, Richman says.
   He calls the bigotry charges ``a phony issue. ... My opponent has
cleverly fanned the flames and used it as an excuse not to debate.''
   Adding to the ethnic heat was an Aug. 20 comment by the Rev.
Thomas Ferguson, chairman of the black Republican caucus, as he
toured churches with Ms. Ros-Lehtinen. He said ``Mr. Richman does
not believe in God like we do.''
   And in the campaign's final weekend, a Spanish-language flier
went out to Hispanics in the 18th District, reading:
   ``We want Mr. Gerald Richman to understand one thing: `We, too,
are Americans.' No, we weren't born in Brooklyn, New York, like him.
No, we don't speak English the same way he does.''
   Jeff Eller, spokesman for Richman, called the flier ``bald
hypocrisy.''
   Overall, they have similar views on most issues, but they differ
sharply on some emotional issues, such as:
   _Abortion: Ms. Ros-Lehtinen favors more restrictions, Richman
favors more choice. With polls indicating most voters are
pro-choice, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen says abortion is not a congressional
issue.
   _Orlando Bosch: Ms. Ros-Lehtinen has argued for freedom for the
anti-Castro militant considered a hero by many Cuban exiles. Richman
says Bosch, called a terrorist by U.S. officials, should be deported
to a third country.
   _Prayer in schools: Ms. Ros-Lehtinen favors a constitutional
amendment allowing voluntary prayer; Richman is opposed. She also
wants a constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning, which
Richman opposes.
   _Official English: Ms. Ros-Lehtinen fought in the Legislature to
block implementation of an official English amendment passed by
voters. Richman said he would support making English the nation's
official language.
   While Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, wife of U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen,
campaigns as tough on crime, Richman has tried to turn her
opposition to gun control into proof she is weak on crime, saying
she favors allowing criminals easy access to guns.

   The lower Mississippi River region is so poor
that one section is called ``America's Ethiopia,'' and a federal
commission is seeking new ways to help its dying towns and end
generations of dependence on welfare.
   There are counties with more than a quarter of the work force
idled, a lack of capital to attract new jobs, and waste of human
resources, like teen-age mothers with sickly babies and adults who
cannot read or write.
   Unlike a foreign country in need, the region of 214 counties in
seven states covered by the study gets neither enough sympathy from
Washington nor bailouts from international financiers, says Wilbur
Hawkins Jr., executive director of the Lower Mississippi Delta
Development Commission.
   ``It's nice, well and dandy to take care of foreign nations,''
Hawkins said. ``But here we are in America _ we can afford to send
money to Poland, to the Caribbean nations, but not to the Delta.''
   ``There is a lack of care about the Delta's problems, a lot of
unconcern,'' said one commission member, Rep. Ed Jones, D-Tenn. ``I
think the Southern people are concerned, and now it's time for the
nation to be concerned.''
   The commission members represent Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee and are appointed by
the states' governors. Congress assigned the commission to come up
with a 10-year plan for government and private action to lift the
region out of poverty.
   Geographically, a river's delta is at its mouth; the
Mississippi's is the area below New Orleans where it spills into the
Gulf of Mexico. But Congress, noting common problems of the mostly
agrarian poor counties stretching from southern Illinois to the tip
of Louisiana, grouped the seven states under the common heading of
``Delta'' in creating the commission.
   The region has long relied on agriculture, river commerce and
industries that have suffered because of overseas competition. The
river is lined by rich farmland and dotted by small waterfront
towns, like Helena, and a few population centers, like Memphis,
Tenn., which have some prosperity.
   Of the 11 million people in the region, 40 percent fall below
federal poverty guidelines, according to Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   More than half the residents of northwestern Mississippi's Tunica
County, which earned the ``America's Ethiopia'' nickname, live below
the poverty level.
   Across the Mississippi at Lee County, Ark., the per capita income
is $6,542. The hospital was closed for lack of money.
   At Lakeview, Ark., south of Helena, rampant teen-age pregnancy
prompted distribution of contraceptives at the school health clinic
_ but the program was curtailed for lack of funds.
   One stumbling block to national action is a lack of awareness
about the Delta, Hawkins said. During a recent meeting in
Washington, Hawkins said he asked why more federal contracts go to
Puerto Rico than Mississippi.
   ``Puerto Rico is just as American as Mississippi,'' Hawkins
quoted an official as responding, ``Then in his next breath, he
said, `What can you make? What can you do?'''
   The swampy land lining the Big Muddy was drained and pioneered by
plantation owners over the last century. Rich in deep topsoil and
natural resources, poor in capital, the Delta counts agriculture as
its dominant industry.
   But wealth never trickled down from the landowners; residents,
many of them sharecroppers, stayed poor and got poorer with the
changing fortunes of farming, which has a reverberating effect in
the little-diversified economy.
   The commission's preliminary proposal for a 10-year improvement
plan, to be presented to Congress in October, was compiled during
the past six months. It runs more than 70 pages and is packed with
new statistical data, Hawkins says. The congressional mandate calls
for a final report in May 1990.
   Hawkins also says the mandate bars any release of details until
Congress gets the report.
   But long-time Delta residents say the region's problems can be
boiled down to one word: money. Money to attract jobs, train workers
and battle conditions that smother hope and erode families.
   Hawkins recently scouted Phillips County for a site for the
commission's late-summer meeting in Arkansas. At Elaine, as he
walked down a gravel road toward time-worn houses, he was surrounded
by curious youngsters.
   ``What are y'all doing this summer?'' Hawkins asked.
   ``Nothing,'' replied 12-year-old James Ellis.
   Hawkins hoisted another child, 2-year-old Bryant Hart, into his
arms.
   ``We want to make his tomorrow better. That is what this is
about,'' he said. ``You ask what this boy's life is going to be like
_ this is the future generation. His future depends on the success
of what we do.''

   Christopher W. French, who during his 23
years with The Associated Press was a newsman, administrator and
editor of the AP Stylebook, has died. He was 49.
   French's wife, Sarah, discovered his body at their home in this
New York City suburb Friday after returning from a visit to
relatives out of state. The cause of death was not immediately
determined.
   Since 1980, French was editor of the AP Stylebook, a 284-page
manual that prescribes word usage, punctuation and other guidelines
for news writing and is used by news media across the nation.
   The Boston-born journalist was a political science graduate of
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he studied
under a Navy scholarship. After four years of Navy service,
including stints as a gunnery, personnel and public relations
officer, he joined the AP in 1966 as a newsman in the news service's
Chattanooga, Tenn., office.
   In 1969, he was assigned to Nashville, the main Tennessee bureau.
In 1971-72 he was a political reporter at the Tennessee statehouse
and helped cover the 1972 national presidential campaign, including
the national party conventions. In November 1972 he was named state
editor in Tennessee.
   French transferred in 1974 to the General Desk in New York, the
central AP news desk, where he was a national editor and supervisor.
   Six years later, he was appointed AP Stylebook editor. In that
position, which he has recently shared as co-editor, he updated the
manual annually to include new subject areas and take account of
changing times and usages.
   Among other editorial responsibilities at the General Desk,
French was editor of the AP Industry News Advisory, a compilation of
reports on developments within the news industry that is transmitted
weekly on AP wires.
   Since 1981, he also held the position of General Desk
administrative assistant for technology. He acted as liaison between
the editorial and technical staffs, and helped introduce new
computer systems into the AP headquarters in New York.
   Besides his wife, the former Sarah Quackenboss, he is survived by
two daughters, Emily and Catherine; by a sister, Suzanne French
O'Brien of Hopkinton, N.H., and by his mother, Thelma Westerling
French of Massachusetts.
   A memorial service will be conducted at 2 p.m. Tuesday at Christ
Episcopal Church in East Norwalk. In lieu of flowers, the family
asked that contributions be made to the donor's charity of choice.

   Roy Orbison gained fame as a singer during his
lifetime and now his family, musicians and fans want to make sure
his name lives on.
   About 2,500 fans gathered Saturday in the town where Orbison grew
up for a memorial concert, which Mayor Maxie Watts hopes will become
an annual event.
   Proceeds will be used for a statue of the singer and a museum
honoring him.
   Orbison died Dec. 6 of a heart attack. He was 52.
   Orbison's son, Wesley, and the singer's 43-year-old brother, Sam,
came from Tennessee for the concert at which 10 musical acts
including a Roy Orbison imitator performed.
   ``I know that Dad never went in for publicity, but then again, he
was very honored when people respected what he did,'' said the
24-year-old son.
   Sam Orbison said, ``I think it's great. He would be impressed
with the fact that they were doing this for him.''
   Wink is about 60 miles west of Midland.

<HEAD>New Social Security Chief Mixes Compassion, `Junkyard Dog' Tenacity</HEAD>

   The nation's new Social Security chief,
Gwendolyn S. King, is taking charge with a mixture of grace and
grit: stressing compassion for the public and vowing to snarl like a
``junkyard dog'' if anyone tries to siphon trust fund reserves.
   ``When I say I want more responsive service, I don't want to just
sit back and answer questions. I want to be out there on the
forefront figuring out how we can help people better,'' Mrs. King
said in an interview.
   Sworn in Aug. 1 as commissioner of the Social Security
Administration, Mrs. King commands an agency second in size only to
the Defense Department. SSA provides monthly Social Security
benefits to 38 million Americans and distributes Supplemental
Security Income checks to another 4 million needy people who are
aged, blind or disabled.
   Mrs. King, a 48-year-old former congressional, state and federal
employee who breezed through Senate confirmation proceedings, said
one of her first concerns was ``how do you get your hands on the
levers of an agency that has 65,000 employees.''
   She is working to improve service to retirees and other
beneficiaries, protect Social Security reserves for future
generations, and boost morale in a work force slashed by 20 percent
during the Reagan years.
   ``Part of what I am doing is letting people at Social Security
know that the important part of their job is doing it right, with
accuracy and consideration, and with some compassion,'' she said.
``I go ballistic when I hear that people have been rudely treated.''
   Social Security employees in recent years have complained that
heavy staff reductions made it impossible for them to do their jobs
right, but Mrs. King, who replaced Dorcas Hardy as SSA chief, said a
modernization program will ease workloads.
   A nationwide toll-free telephone network will be in full force by
Oct. 1, allowing more people to take care of simple transactions by
phone and giving office workers more time to handle complex
problems, she said.
   Congressional critics have complained that the new telephone
lines, now serving more than 60 percent of the country, too often
are busy and that employees sometimes provide inaccurate information.
   Mrs. King said she wants to expand programs to find homeless and
needy people who may not realize they are entitled to Social
Security or SSI benefits.
   She also wants to encourage employees to steer people who are not
entitled to Social Security benefits toward other government
assistance for which they might qualify, such as meals on wheels or
public health services.
   In addition to her responsibility to today's Social Security
beneficiaries, Mrs. King also must safeguard the growing trust fund
reserves needed to finance benefits when the Baby Boom generation
begins to retire.
   While the tight budget situation in Washington tempts some to
talk about using the reserves for other purposes, Mrs. King said the
``predominant sentiment'' is to leave the trust funds untouched.
   ``One of the best communicators I've ever seen has been the
junkyard dog, who, by simply baring his teeth and snarling, sends a
message that everybody understands,'' Mrs. King said. ``I'll be that
junkyard dog for the trust fund. I'll just make sure that if I see
it coming, I'll start snarling so loud and so hard that it won't
happen.''
   Another thing Mrs. King plans to fight is any attempt to remove
SSA from the Department of Health and Human Services and make it an
independent agency governed by a board.
   Several members of Congress are backing such a plan as a way to
give SSA greater clout and isolate it from political infighting, but
Mrs. King said it would only deny Social Security representation
within the Cabinet and weaken its leadership.
   ``I don't think this is the time to start tampering with a system
that is working,'' she said. ``It's not broken; there's no need to
fix it. Social Security is on a roll.''

   A two-story house east of London has been
identified as Britain's oldest inhabited residence and the only
domestic building surviving from before the Norman conquest of 1066.
   It has been in continuous use for 1,000 years and is still lived
in.
   Dr. Nicola Smith of the Historic Buildings and Monuments
Commission, writing in the weekly Country Life magazine, said the
40-foot-long house called Prior's Hall at Widdington had previously
been dated from the 13th century.
   But the discovery of Saxon stonework under the plaster showed it
was probably built in the 10th century, she said.
   The building may originally have been a church or chapel, Dr.
Stone said.
   The Saxons came from Germany and dominated Britain in the 600
years before the Norman conquest, when they were known as
Anglo-Saxons.
   Some of their churches and farm buildings have survived.

   The Kremlin cannot trust the Polish Army in
case of an East-West European confrontation _ but neither can
Western war planners bank on Polish troops breaking ranks with their
Soviet allies during a conflict, experts say.
   ``It is an unreliable force. I think that has been the Soviet
General Staff calculation for years, and I think it has got to be
even more the conclusion'' now that the communists have lost control
of the Polish government, said A. Ross Johnson, a former RAND Corp.
expert on Warsaw Pact military forces who now heads Radio Free
Europe.
   Unless the Soviets have firm control of Polish rail lines, they
would face grave difficulties waging a ground war in Europe,
according to analysts who have studied the issue for the Pentagon.
   Ian Cutherbertson, a British expert on Eastern Europe, said,
``The Soviets long have realized the unreliability of the Polish
Armed Forces. Most of them are earmarked to protect Soviet
communications lines in Poland for the Group of Western Forces,''
the half-million Soviet troops in East Germany.
   The chances that Polish or other Warsaw Pact units actually would
see combat in a European war would be greatly diminished if Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev carries out his proposal to reduce
Soviet troop levels Eastern Europe from 625,000 to 350,000, while
cutting Red Army tank forces in half. President Bush has proposed
smaller cuts in Atlantic Alliance forces.
   ``Gorbachev is in the process of withdrawing the forces that
would give the Soviets surprise capability,'' said a U.S.
intelligence analyst.
   Questions about the loyalties of the Polish army began long ago,
although the emergence of a Solidarity government marks a watershed
in western perception of the issue.
   Poland has the second largest military in the Warsaw Pact, with
just over 600,000 Army and uniformed police forces, including
reserves, according to a 1986 RAND study written for the Pentagon by
a former Polish officer, Michael Sadykiewicz, now a consultant in
London.
   According to Sadykiewicz and other analysts with access to
intelligence data, Kremlin war plans call for most of the Polish
forces to guard rail and communication lines that would be needed to
reinforce frontline Soviet units in East Germany.
   As many as 1 million Soviet troops would move across Poland in
the event of war, occupying the country along the way, according to
some Western estimates.
   Many Polish generals, including President Wojciech Jaruzelski,
were trained in the Soviet Union, but loyalty to the Kremlin
decreases down the ranks of the mainly conscript army, said Johnson
and Cutherbertson, a scholar at the Institute for East-West Security
Studies in New York.
   ``They had conscripts coming directly out of Solidarity and there
is evidence that they were seen as much less reliable than the
conscripts of the 1970s,'' said Johnson.
   But analysts, cautioning against the assumption that the Polish
Army will refuse to fight alongside the Soviets, cite contradictory
evidence of Polish loyalties.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa and the new Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki have given assurances that the Communist Party
will head the defense and interior ministries, which control the
military and the police, and that Poland will remain in the Warsaw
Pact.
   Additionally, President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the communist leader
who declared martial law against Solidarity on Dec. 13, 1981,
remains president, with the power to declare a new state of
emergency.
   The army, in cracking down on Solidarity eight years ago, proved
that it could be used by the government against popular unrest.
However, one defector, Ryszard Kuklinski, a former colonel in the
Polish Armed Forces, has written that Jaruzelski long resisted
Kremlin pressure to use the military against the independent trade
union.
   The uncertainty of Polish loyalties has led the Kremlin to assign
just over half of Poland's military and police units to defend the
``internal front'' against domestic unrest, said Sadykiewicz,
drawing on his years in the Polish military.
   A smaller group, including elite and maritime paratroop units,
would advance with Soviet forces on a so-called ``second echelon
front'' across the Baltic and into Denmark, away from the main
battleground, Germany, according to Sadykiewicz and other experts.
   Red Army generals have planned to position ``Soviet forces in
front of, beside and even behind the Polish forces'' to ensure that
they would advance across Western Europe in step with any Soviet
offensive, said Johnson.

   Criticism of ``Casualties of War'' reflects the
continuing American conflict over the Vietnam war, says director
Brian De Palma, rather than a fundamental problem with his film's
portrayal of the war.
   The film, starring Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, depicts the rape
and murder of a Vietnamese woman by American soldiers and is based
on a 1969 report in The New Yorker magazine.
   Veterans organizations say the film promotes false stereotypes
about American soldiers' conduct in the war, while other critics
have characterized it as gratuitously violent.
   ``I've got many letters from veterans who say the movie's
completely accurate about the kind of things that went on there,''
De Palma told reporters Sunday at the World Film Festival. ``So the
thing was divided then and it's divided now.''
   He said that because of his critics' various political agendas,
``they aren't really paying attention to anything that appears on
the screen.''
   De Palma, 48, said Americans needed to make movies about Vietnam
``to continually remind ourselves that we make mistakes and that we
can make them again.''
   De Palma's next project is a screen adaptation of Tom Wolfe's
novel ``Bonfire of the Vanities.'' De Palma said he didn't know who
would get the coveted role of the book's protagonist, stockbroker
Sheldon McCoy.

   Actress Barbara Hershey and other residents
of nearby Southbury are fighting a zoning change that would permit
``war games'' in the countryside around this quaint New England town.
   Hershey, who has starred in movies such as ``Beaches,'' ``The
Natural'' and ``The Right Stuff,'' said through a spokesman she was
``appalled that anyone would want to hurt this historic neighborhood
with anything as ugly as war games.''
   Southbury resident Heather Kennedy said she was concerned about
the increased traffic. Southbury is 6 miles west of Oxford; the two
towns are about 80 miles northeast of New York City.
   ``Right now there's maybe 20 or 25 cars,'' Kennedy said. ``I'm
mainly opposed to the traffic up and down the street and I'm opposed
to the war games being right here in the neighborhood.''
   In the war game, players wear protective goggles and fire at each
other with paint-pellet pistols. The zoning change would allow the
weekend game on parcels of at least 200 acres.
   ``It's the kind of thing, you should try it to get a feel for
it,'' said Glen Kapostas, a photographer who proposed bringing the
game to Oxford.

   Comedian Bob Hope poked fun at men and
promoted women's rights as he completed four days of performances to
help a library.
   ``I truly believe that one day Mount Rushmore will be co-ed,'' he
said during a final appearance Saturday. ``And it's about time. We
have kept them down long enough.''
   The 86-year-old comedian also took a shot at his own gender.
   ``A husband turned to his wife and said, `How can you be so
incredibly beautiful and so incredibly stupid at the same time.'
   ``The wife retorted: `It's God's will. He made me incredibly
beautiful so that you may be attracted to me and he made me
incredibly stupid so that I could be attracted to you.'''
   Hope's appearances in northeastern Wisconsin raised from $75,000
and $100,000 for the Appleton Library Foundation.

   Country music entertainer Willie Nelson
says he hopes another pair of Farm Aid concerts will help rekindle
concern about the nation's continuing farm crisis.
   ``Music is always the best communicator,'' Nelson told reporters
Saturday during an appearance with Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey before
a concert at the Chase County Fair.
   Nelson said he plans to have a small Farm Aid concert in
Washington, D.C., in March, followed by a larger concert a few weeks
later, perhaps at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. Previous
concerts, the first in 1985, were held in Champaign, Ill.; Austin,
Texas; and Lincoln.
   The benefit concerts, featuring rock and country music stars,
have brought much needed attention to the plight of farmers, Nelson
said. The first three raised $6.5 million for farmers, but that's a
``drop in the bucket'' considering farmers' needs, he said.

   James Meredith, the first black student to
attend the University of Mississippi, is moving to San Diego after
five years in Cincinnati.
   Meredith, 56, would not disclose his plans. He came to Cincinnati
in 1984 as a visiting professor at the University of Cincinnati's
African-American Studies Department.
   Meredith later criticized the school, which did not renew his
one-year contract, for not graduating enough black athletes.
University officials said at least 51 black athletes had graduated
since 1964.
   Meredith lost a bid for a seat on the Cincinnati Board of
Education in 1985 and ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state
board of education.
   He spent recent years in various trades including tree farming
and financial counseling.
   ``I have no complaints,'' Meredith said at a going away party
Sunday. ``Everything I came here to do, I accomplished.''

   Three love-stuck couples took a break during
the Great American Kiss-Off to rest their jaws and make wedding vows.
   They started kissing for the money, but showed it was really for
love Saturday in the contest at a furniture store parking lot.
   The six were among six couples still contesting the $10,000 grand
prize Sunday after going at it for 18 straight 12-hours days.
   Pronounced husband and wife, the three couples began perhaps the
longest post-nuptial kisses in history.
   ``Here they go again,'' said one woman, shaking her head.
   The idea for the parking-lot wedding was hatched last week when
Lloyd Gubler, 23, and Laura Sue Bradley, 25 realized they would have
to cancel their wedding plans to take part in the Kiss-Off.
   ``At first, I thought, `Getting married in a parking lot? I don't
know,''' said Laura.
   The two couples who joined them were John Castle, 20, and Crystal
Larribas, 18; and Jason Knapp, 20, and Menette McVey, 19.
   The three couples saved up five-minute break periods allowed in
the contest so they could have an hour for their weddings.

   A 5-month-old mallard known as It's Miller
Time waddled off with the title of the world's fastest duck at the
Great American Duck Race.
   ``Finally,'' said trainer Gary Miller of Anthony, N.M. ``It's
been a long time coming, with so many second and third places. It's
a great feeling to win.''
   Miller, who has entered ducks eight-straight years, said he was
nervous during the early heats Saturday.
   ``But I calmed down and so did the duck and we did it,'' he said.
   His duck covered the 16-foot track at the Deming Duck Downs on
the lawn of the Luna County Courthouse in 1.42 seconds, winning by a
bill in a photo finish over several hundred other contestants. The
time was well off the record of 1.23 seconds by Oliver South two
years ago.
   Miller, who took home about $3,000 in prizes, said he trained his
ducks only nine days but had them on a special high-protein diet.
   An estimated crowd of 25,000 attended the weekend events, which
included the race, a tortilla toss, a chili cookoff and a best
dressed duck contest.

   Rifle-toting Sikh radicals raided a
passenger train in Punjab state and shot to death at least 22 Hindu
passengers, a senior police official said today.
   At least 30 others were wounded in the attack on the
Suratgarh-Bhatinda train late Sunday, said K.P.S. Gill,
director-general of Punjab police. Ten were in a serious condition.
   But the English-language Tribune newspaper, published in Punjab's
state capital of Chandigarh, said 70 people had died and 150 were
wounded in the attack.
   Gill said nine Sikh militants with automatic rifles stormed the
train and opened fire after separating the Hindu passengers from
Sikhs. Most of the victims, including two women and three children,
died at the scene, he said.
   The attack occurred at Qabarwala in Fridkot district of the
northern farming state. The area is 85 miles south of the Sikh holy
city of Amritsar.
   Sikh radicals have been fighting for an independent Sikh nation
in Punjab since 1982. They allege discrimination by the Hindus,
India's religious majority.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
the Sikhs account for only two percent of the population.
   The Sikhs are, however, hold a slight majority in Punjab.
   At least 1,224 deaths this year have been blamed on Sikh radicals
in Punjab.
   In a similar attack in August 1988, Sikh radicals raided a train
and killed 11 Hindus.

   WCBS-TV newsman Jim Jensen says he was able to
give up his cocaine habit quickly, but the torturous withdrawal to
break his addiction to Valium pushed him to the point of considering
suicide.
   ``It was a monumental depression,'' the 62-year-old Jensen said
in this week's People magazine. ``You feel as though there's no
future left, you might as well die.''
   WCBS and family members persuaded him to enter the depression
unit at St. Mary's hospital in Minneapolis shortly after his 25th
anniversary party at the CBS affiliate in February.
   The depression was caused by kicking a 4{-year addiction to
Valium, which a doctor prescribed for a sleep disorder, Jensen said.
   ``There was a bridge over the Mississippi _ I thought about
that,'' he said. ``I never actively did anything, but the thoughts
cross your mind.''
   Jensen said he was bothered by losing his anchor spot, but has
been back at work since June as a senior correspondent.
   He said he takes an antidepressant drug every day, and hopes to
be off it in a few months. He sees a psychiatrist once a week and
attends daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Jensen said he
celebrated one year of sobriety Aug. 2.
   ``People on the street, they pat me on the back,'' he said.
``It's wonderful. They're all pulling for me. I can't let them

   As a tape recording of his voice floated
past Neptune, rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry laid down an earthy
beat for dancing scientists at a Voyager bash outside the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``Go, Voyager, go!'' Berry sang as he belted out a slightly
modified version of his classic ``Johnny B. Goode.'' A recording of
that song was among the cultural and historical items aboard aboard
Voyager 2, 2.76 billion miles from Earth.
   Sunday night's celebration, attended by 1,500 scientists,
engineers and their families, was part of a special program
sponsored by The Planetary Society and televised on Turner
Broadcasting System in the United States, Asahi Broadcasting in
Japan and on state television in the Soviet Union, said astronomer
Carl Sagan, who was host of the party.
   Voyager 2 achieved its close encounter with Neptune on Thursday
night and flew past the moon Triton on Friday, capping its historic
exploration of the outer solar system.
   In case some alien civilization ever stumbles upon Voyager 2 or
its twin, Voyager 1, the space probes each carry a 12-inch copper
record containing greetings in 60 languages and a variety of sounds
from Earth, including ``Johnny B. Goode.''
   ``I could never be gratified more than being part of that,''
Berry said after the concert, where many normally somber scientists
dancing to the beat.
   Sagan, a Cornell University astronomer who helped popularize
space science with his ``Cosmos'' TV series, ended the celebration
by saying, ``I'm going to go get some sleep, or maybe I'll do a
little dancing.''

<HEAD>Agriculture Department Predicts Larger Meat Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower feed costs forecast by the Agriculture
Department are expected to help boost livestock output in the months
ahead, and that eventually will mean larger supplies of beef, pork
and poultry for consumers.
   But department economists say consumer demand and prices are
harder to predict because so much depends on weather, the nation's
general economy, overseas markets and other variables.
   Ralph Parlett of the department's Economic Research Service says
retail food prices in general are expected to rise an average of 5
percent to 7 percent this year from 1988 _ when the increase was 4.1
percent.
   ``Prices for red meats, poultry, eggs, fresh vegetables and
processed vegetables rose sharply during the first half of the
year,'' he said. ``Although most of these will decline in the second
half, overall food prices will be about steady.''
   Historically, this year's increase is the sharpest since 1981
when food prices climbed 7.8 percent.
   According to the current forecast for 1989, retail beef and veal
prices _ which, with pork, are measured on an all-cut basis _ are
going up an average of 4 percent to 6 percent, compared with a 5.5
percent increase in 1988.
   Pork prices may hold steady or even decline by as much as 2
percent from last year. And pork prices, reflecting a downward
crunch on hog farmers, dropped 3 percent in 1988, ending several
years of rising prices.
   Behind the scenes, far from the supermarket counters shopped by
consumers, some important developments are taking place.
   ``Cattle inventories at the beginning of July indicated probable
herd expansion,'' says the September issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine. ``The number of beef cows that have calved was unchanged,
while replacement beef heifers increased 4 percent from a year
earlier.''
   But that involves long-term expansion, simply because of the
biological clock. It takes nine months for a newly bred heifer to
deliver a calf, and another 15 to 20 months before the calf is grown
up for slaughter and turned into supermarket beef.
   July surveys indicated that on-farm supplies of feeder cattle _
younger steers and heifers that could be sent to feedlots for
further growth _ were up 1 percent from a year earlier.
   Improved forage conditions have helped producers hold back on
sending feeder cattle to feedlots this summer, allowing more animals
to be kept in pastures instead.
   ``The high prices currently necessary to bid feeder cattle away
from pasture may be too great to ensure profitability in the
feedlots without much lower grain prices,'' the report said.
   According to USDA estimates feed grain production will rebound
sharply from last year's yield-shriveling drought, led by a 49
percent jump in corn output to around 7.35 billion bushels as of
Aug. 1 indications.
   Corn market prices are projected to drop to an average of $1.85
to $2.30 per bushel in the marketing year that will begin Sept. 1,
from $2.50 to $2.60 estimated for 1988-89.
   Extensive price specials in June and July, especially for
lower-valued cuts, pushed retail beef prices down after rising for
six months, the report said. But with lower beef output this fall,
prices are expected to rise again in the fourth quarter, a period of
seasonally greater demand.
   Looking at the hog situation, the report said producers are in
for lower market prices as slaughter picks up seasonally in
September.
   ``Weekly kills could approach 1.9 million head by November,
compared with a midsummer rate of about 1.5 million,'' the report
said. ``This will put downward pressure on fresh pork prices,
prompting packers to bid less for hogs.''
   Market hogs that sold in the high $40s per 100 pounds at
midsummer could decline $10 before bottoming out this fall, the
report said. Prices in the fourth quarter could average in the high
$30s per hundredweight, close to year-earlier levels.
   ``Although feed costs are expected to decline this fall, returns
to hog producers likely will remain below break-even,'' the report
said. ``The extended period of poor returns could cause producers to
reduce breedings below previous intentions.''
   Cutbacks in breeding farrowings this fall would reduce pork
production after the first quarter of 1990.
   Meanwhile, broiler producers have stepped up production, which
led to a summer decline in wholesale prices. Analysts said those
prices are likely to keep declining this fall as more broilers go to
market. Total output is expected to be up 6 percent to 7 percent
from 1988.
   Turkey production is expected to rise 4 percent to 5 percent this
year. Wholesale prices of hen turkeys in the Eastern markets
averaged 65 cents per pound in July, down five cents from a year
earlier.
   However, prices are expected to strengthen as retailers buy
additional turkeys for holiday consumption.
   Poultry prices at the consumer level, overall, are expected to
rise an average of 6 percent to 8 percent in 1989, compared with a
7.2 percent gain in 1988. Those include prices of all birds sold at
retail.
   Egg production is expected to drop only 2 percent this year
instead of the 3 percent decline estimated earlier, the report said.
Profits have improved and have spurred some rebuilding of flocks.
   The New York wholesale price for Grade A large eggs rose from
about 76 cents per dozen in July to around 85 cents by August,
compared with the high 60s a year earlier, the report said. Prices
are expected be in the range of 80 to 82 cents in the third quarter
and then decline to 68 to 72 cents in the fourth.
   Over the entire year, USDA economists predicted that retail egg
prices will average 15 percent to 20 percent more than in 1988.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: A Relaxed Jackson Moves to Washington</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson is relaxed. One of Washington's
newest residents, he is biding his time. Gone for the moment is the
fiery preacher of the campaign trail, but the provocative language
remains.
   His voice low, wearing blue jeans and boots, the two-time
presidential candidate dodges questions about his political future,
especially about talk that he will run for mayor of Washington next
year.
   Jackson has moved his home and office from Chicago to the
capital, but that's as far as he'll commit himself publicly. ``It's
not an appropriate time to discuss'' a mayoral bid, he says.
   But he drops tantalizing hints. ``I'm not interested in being a
mayor under occupation. That's not very attractive,'' he said. Does
that mean he won't run for mayor? ``There's no race in 1989,'' is
the answer.
   Jackson calls Washington ``the cradle of democracy and the last
domestic U.S. colony.''
   What he means is that the District of Columbia is a city
controlled by Congress. Although district residents can vote for
president, they have only one nonvoting delegate in the House of
Representatives.
   Jackson wants Washington to become the 51st or 52nd state,
depending on whether Puerto Rico votes for statehood when a
plebiscite is held there in 1991.
   ``Congress is an occupying power. It can appropriate land,
restrict the budget. The mayor is under occupation. He has no
ability to influence Congress except through sympathy, and when
there's none of that...''
   There is very little sympathy in Congress for Jackson's old
friend from the days of their 1960s civil rights marches, Mayor
Marion Barry.
   The three-term mayor has been dogged by questions about his
behavior. He has been questioned about his association with a man
later convicted of selling drugs. And two of his top aides have been
convicted of stealing from the city.
   Washington's record drug-related killings, its high infant
mortality rate and the city's budget deficit have prompted Congress
to commission a critical study of the capital's management. Rather
than elevating it to statehood, it has been suggested that the mayor
be replaced by a less-powerful city manager.
   Jackson is appalled. ``Residents of Washington must be made full
partners in democracy,'' he said.
   He reels off statistics. Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, Vermont and
North Dakota have smaller populations than Washington's 650,000, who
pay federal taxes like everyone else.
   ``This is taxation without representation. Even Beijing and
Moscow are represented in their legislatures,'' Jackson said.
   With an area of 68.25 square miles, the district would be less
than one-tenth the size of Rhode Island, by far the smallest of the
50 states.
   Jackson shrugs that off. Statehood for the predominantly black
district will open the Senate to black Americans who are not
currently represented in the chamber, he said.
   Would he like to be Senator Jackson, or maybe Governor Jackson?
   ``That's not the issue here,'' he said.
   Jackson, who has never held public office, has said he will not
challenge Barry, but political observers suggest the beleaguered
mayor may step down some time next year and leave Jackson a
virtually clear field. That, in turn, could preclude a third bid by
Jackson for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 1992.
   Some suggest that without the often-controversial Jackson on the
Democrats' left wing, the party might stand a better chance of
uniting and capturing the White House in 1992 after more than 10
years in presidential exile.
   But Jackson refuses to be drawn into such speculation.
   ``I stand a good chance of winning the (presidential) nomination
if I choose to run in 1992,'' he said. ``I'm on an upward curve.''

   Police officers in the country's largest cities
fought about 50 percent more violent crimes per officer in 1987 than
their counterparts a decade earlier, the Justice Department reports.
   Municipal police departments in the country's 59 largest cities
employed about 120,000 sworn officers in 1987, an increase of about
2 percent than in 1977, the department said in a report released
Sunday.
   During the same decade, the number of violent crimes reported in
the 59 cities jumped from 939 per 100,000 population in 1977 to
1,346 per 100,000 population, an increase of 43 percent, according
to the report.
   The report said the statistics reflected an average 50 percent
increase in number of violent crimes reported per officer _ an
average of 4 such crimes per officer in 1977 compared to 6 such
crimes per officer in 1987.
   The study examined police department staffing and crime
statistics in municipalities of at least 250,000 inhabitants.
   The report did not take into account changes in the number of
people working for federal law enforcement agencies or for
supplemental local agencies such as transit police, public housing
police or park police.
   Among other findings in the report:
   _Departments on average reported increases in the use of
civilians for a variety of duties from clerical work to crime
laboratory analysis. Civilian employees made up 23 percent of the
total work force in 1987 compared to 20.5 percent 10 years earlier.
   _Among the 25 largest departments, 9 percent of the police
officers were women, 14 percent were black and 8 percent Hispanic in
1987.
   _All of the 59 police departments had community crime prevention
units and more than 75 percent had special units for child abuse,
drug eduction in schools and missing children cases in 1987.
   The largest department is in New York City with 27,478 officers,
or 3.8 officers per 1,000 population. Among the 25 largest
departments, the ratio of officers per 1,000 population ranged from
a low of 1.5 in San Antonio, Texas, and San Diego, Calif., to 6.2 in
Washington, D.C.
   The average ratio was 2.3 sworn officers per 1,000 residents in
1987, compared to 2.4 per 1,000 in 1977.
   The report was prepared by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a
part of the Justice Department's Office of Justice Programs.

   Political literature is booming as the
bans and restrictions imposed by Chile's right-wing military
government appear to be coming to an end.
   Books ranging from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's latest to
controversial political essays have become best-sellers, and
literary experts believe the trend will continue because of the
outgoing government of conservative President Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
   After seizing power in a bloody 1973 coup, Pinochet decreed a
total ban on political activities. Congress was closed, political
parties disbanded and severe censorship on books and the news media
were enforced.
   In the last few years, however, most bans have gradually
disappeared as the nation has prepared to pick a successor to
Pinochet. The vote, in the first presidential election since 1970,
is scheduled for Dec. 14.
   Political activity now is virtually free, bringing a boom to
political literature.
   Experts say the long period they lived without access to a
variety of freely published information left Chileans ripe for the
wave of political literature.
   ``The public was thirsty for political information,'' said
Ignacio Gonzalez, a journalist who authored ``The Day Allende
Died,'' one of the most successful books in Chile in 1988.
   The novelized book is a vivid, well-researched account of events
at the government house on Sept. 11, 1973, the day Pinochet toppled
elected President Salvador Allende. Allende, a Marxist, died in the
takeover.
   Gonzalez' book sold 11,000 copies in three months, a notable
figure in this small South American country where sales of 3,000
books is considered a best-seller.
   ``I think people reacted with enthusiasm because of the
attraction of learning things that had been forbidden to them for so
long,'' Gonzalez said in an interview.
   Even more successful was ``The Silent Revolution,'' a report on
the achievements of the Pinochet government, by Joaquin Lavin, a
conservative economist.
   Published in December 1987, Lavin's book sold over 150,000 copies
in 11 months, becoming the second-largest selling book in Chile's
history, Lavin claims. He said it places second only to ``Farewell
to the 7th Regiment,'' a novel based on the 1879 war that Chile won
over Peru and Bolivia.
   An official at the Chilean Book Chamber said that although no
precise figures have been compiled, Lavin's claim appears correct.
   ``I just tried to tell Chileans how the country is that they live
in these days,'' Lavin said. ``The book shows them how their country
has changed.''
   Gonzalez and Lavin believe public interest on political books
will survive the end of military rule.
   Book records show that at least three political titles have
appeared in the weekly lists of 6 top-selling books for over a year.
   The best-selling non-political book in recent months was ``The
General in his Labyrinth,'' a biography of Simon Bolivar, the
Venezuelan-born liberator of South America, by Colombian Nobel
Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. The book has sold
65,000 copies in eight months.
   Experts say it's too early to determine the effects the
availability of political books is having on Chileans.
   Among the leading books on political matters in recent years are
those by Gonzalez and Lavin.
   Also, ``Gen. Prats' Memoirs,'' by Gen. Carlos Prats, the army
commander under Allende who was assassinated in exile in Argentina,
published postumously; ``The Buchi Phenomenon,'' a
bigraphical-political study on Hernan Buchi, the pro-government
presidential candidate in the December election; ``Moscow Here, the
Soviet Union and Perestroika`` as seen by a Chilean journalist,
Bernardo de la Masa; ``Yes or No,'' a study prior to last October's
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend
Pinochet's rule until 1997, by Hermogenes Perez de Arce, a
right-wing author and politician.

   People protesting the shooting death of a black
teen-ager twice marched through a predominantly white neighborhood
and were met by racial taunts, cries of ``Go home,'' and residents
holding watermelons.
   As the five white youths charged in the killing of 16-year-old
Yusef Hawkins were freed on bail, hundreds of residents from their
Brooklyn neighborhood lined the streets to make the demonstrators
feel unwelcome.
   Some residents feared the racially motivated killing would scar
Bensonhurst the way the 1986 death of a black man in Howard Beach
disgraced that community in the borough of Queens.
   ``Find the guy who pulled the trigger and leave us alone,'' one
man shouted Sunday.
   On Saturday, blacks marching through the mainly Italian
neighborhood heard jeers and were spat upon. Some whites held up
watermelons as 300 or so blacks marched.
   On Sunday, the Rev. Timothy Mitchell and other clergymen led more
than 70 protesters, about two-thirds white, in a prayer vigil on the
Bensonhurst street where Hawkins was shot dead Wednesday as he was
confronted by a gang of bat-wielding whites.
   The marchers were then escorted along the 10-block route by more
than 15 police officers on motorcycles and dozens more on foot as
hundreds of white residents shouted at them from behind barricades.
   A 24-year-old man was given a summons for disorderly conduct
after a small firecracker blew up among the demonstrators, said Sgt.
Ed Burns, a police spokesman.
   Mitchell, who conducted a brief memorial service at the site of
the killing, said the marchers were asserting their right to walk
anywhere.
   ``We are not going to get passes to go to Bensonhurst and we're
not going to get passes to go to Howard Beach. We have a right to go
wherever we want,'' he said.
   David Wynyard of the Brooklyn Residents Against Bias Related
Violence said the whites marched Sunday ``to show that white people
are outraged by such incidents.''
   Many residents watched passively from windows and storefronts
while others walked along the street waving posters in the air and
chanting, ``Go smoke your crack'' or ``Go home.''
   ``We are home,'' demonstrators responded.
   ``No part of New York is exempt from us,'' Mitchell said. ``We're
not going to let the racists tell us where we cannot go in this
city.''
   While some residents were expressing sympathy with the five
arrested youths, others said they were shocked by the killing.
   ``A child died, and a mother is in pain, said Carmella
Collandria, who has three children. ``That's the way I feel; that's
the way my neighbors feel. The press has been talking to the wrong
people.''
   Police, meanwhile, searched for 18-year-old Joseph Fama, who was
wanted for questioning. News reports have said investigators believe
he was the gunman.
   Police say a white gang was waiting for black friends of a white
18-year-old woman who lives in the neighborhood. The gang attacked
Hawkins and three companions who were in Bensonhurst to look at a
used car, police said.
   The young woman, Gina Feliciano, who witnessed the attack and
called police, is under police protection. On Saturday, police
arrested a 22-year-old man and charged him with threatening her on
two occasions.
   Among those charged in the racial attack, Keith Mondello, 18, was
released Sunday on $100,000 bail. Steven Curreri, 18; Pasquale
Raucci, 19; Charles Stressler, 21; and James Patino, 24, were
released on $75,000 bail each.
   Mondello, Curreri, Raucci and Stressler are charged with assault,
aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing and
possession of deadly weapons, the baseball bats. Patino was charged
with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civil
rights.

<HEAD>Republic That Speaks Romanian Dialect Becomes Another Ethnic Headache</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Add Moldavia to the ranks of the
Kremlin's ethnic headaches _ the majority Moldavians are pressing to
make their Romanian dialect the official language of this Soviet
republic.
   Leaders of the Moldavian-dominated People's Front see a language
law, to be debated Tuesday by the republic's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, as the first step toward emulating three Baltic
republics' drive for political and economic autonomy.
   Activists of the opposing Yedinstvo, or Unity, movement, fear it
will be the first step toward discriminating against minority
Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Jews and Christian Turks the way
Moldavians have been put down for years.
   An estimated 250,000 to 300,000 people rallied Sunday in this
capital, waving flags and banners boosting ethnic demands. Similar
crowds are expected outside government buildings Tuesday to await
the Supreme Soviet's decision.
   Mikhai Ghimpu, acting chairman of the People's Front, recently
said the language law is a matter of national survival.
   ``When a language disappears, a people disappears,'' he said.
``We reached that point. Every day, everywhere, it's Russian.''
Although 64 percent of the republic's 4.2 million people are
Moldavians, they make up only 43 percent of Kishinev's population.
   The law would make Moldavian, a dialect of the language spoken in
neighboring Romania, the official language. It would also restore
the Latin alphabet that the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin replaced
with Cyrillic when the Soviet Union forcibly took the land from
Romania in 1940.
   Leaders of the People's Front see the adoption of the language
law as vital to protecting Moldavian culture. They are one of many
Soviet ethnic groups who have been agitating for more autonomy from
the Kremlin.
   More than 1 million residents in the Baltics linked hands last
week in a giant chain to protest a Soviet-Nazi pact of 50 years ago
that led to the Soviet annexation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Estonia has declared partial sovereignty from Moscow.
   On Sunday, the Communist Party daily Pravda said the need for a
Moldavian language law was obvious.
   Said Pyotr Shornikov, a leader of Yedinstov, ``We are divided by
a fundamental question _ our attitude toward democracy. They demand
preference, we demand equality.''
   Both sides say their movements aim for broad economic reform of a
republic once ruled by Leonid I. Brezhnev and termed by Shornikov
``one of the epicenters of stagnation.'' But they say their opposite
stands on the language law makes it difficult to cooperate.
   ``We read stories about apartheid in South Africa, where people
are barred from any work except manual labor if their skin is the
wrong color,'' Pyotr Zalozhnikov, a 45-year-old Russian worker, said
by telephone from Tiraspol. ``This is what this law would do to all
people here who are not Moldavians. In one day we'll be made
deaf-mutes. Our children will have no future.''
   The People's Front says the transfer to Moldavian will be
gradual, over about five years, and that officials will be able to
get by learning a few key words for official situations.
   Communist Party chief Semyon Grossu has given his backing to the
language law, virtually ensuring its passage.
   In Tiraspol, whose 200,000 people are almost 90 percent Russian
speakers, almost all factories shut down after publication of the
final draft on Aug. 20, said strike committee member Vsevolod
Yampolsky. Dozens of other factories shut down in Bendery, Rybnitsa
and Komrat, he said.
   Ghimpu, a 37-year-old lawyer, sees the Moldavian People's Front
following the Baltic lead to push for limiting the inflow of
non-Moldavians, more economic independence and tougher residency
requirements.
   Asked his opinion of the Estonian election law that drew a strike
by thousands of Russian workers and censure from the Kremlin for
tightening residency requirements for voting and running for local
office, Ghimpu said, ``I envy them.''
   The People's Front views the language law as the key to righting
two historic wrongs imposed by Stalin _ the seizure of the land from
Romania under the secret 1939 pact that led to the annexation of the
Baltic republics; and the forced conversion of their alphabet from
the Latin used by their Romanian brothers to Cyrillic followed by a
decades-long effort to convince the world that Moldavians and
Romanians are distinct nationalities.
   After Romania refused in 1968 to take part in the Warsaw Pact
invasion of Czechoslovakia, Romanian-produced books disappeared from
Moldavia. Only now are they beginning to reappear. The shelves of a
downtown Kishinev bookstore specializing in books from allies of the
Soviet Union had many more books in Vietnamese than Romanian.
   Among the 12 selections produced in Romania were a coloring book
with no words, a how-to sewing book, a German-Romanian dictionary
and a translation of a French book.
   There is also a territorial aspect to the Moldavians' program, a
call for the return of northern Bukovina and the southern Black Sea
coast from the Ukraine.
   ``The majority recognize this isn't Ukrainian territory,''
Moldavian historian Valery Matei asserted.

   A communications satellite is
orbiting Earth after being propelled by a privately owned rocket in
a launch that opens a new era in the space age.
   The 2,700-pound Marcopolo 1 satellite was drilled into space
Sunday by a three-stage Delta rocket that performed flawlessly
during a 27-minute climb into orbit.
   The launching was the first in which a privately owned rocket
sent a payload into orbit. Consort I, the nation's first licensed
commercial spacecraft, released a payload on a suborbital voyage in
March.
   ``Delta 187 has placed the British Satellite Broadcasting
satellite in orbit; we wish the spacecraft folks good luck,''
reported Ray Adams of McDonnell Douglas, which made the $30 million
Delta.
   The satellite was sent into an elliptical orbit ranging from
about 100 to 22,300 miles high.
   On Tuesday, ground controllers are to send a signal to fire an
onboard motor to place it in a stationary orbit 22,300 miles high,
parking it over the middle Atlantic Ocean within view of the British
Isles.
   Marcopolo 1 is the first of two satellites designed to transmit
television programs direct to British homes equipped with 12-inch
dish antennas, a set-top box and a remote control unit. The
equipment will cost about $450, said Anthony Simonds-Gooding, chief
executive officer of British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd., operator
of the satellite system.
   The launch was a milestone in the U.S. commercial space program
that started after the 1986 Challenger explosion. After the space
shuttle disaster, then-President Reagan told the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to stop launching payloads for
commercial customers. Reagan said the job should be done by private
industry with unmanned rockets.
   ``This is not just another launch; it's the beginning of a new
industry, a landmark event,'' said Stephanie Lee-Miller of the U.S.
Department of Transportation, which licenses commercial launches.
She said 27 additional launches are scheduled through 1993.
   Reagan's decision revitalized a U.S. unmanned space rocket
program that was almost dead because of the nation's growing
reliance on the manned space shuttle to launch all payloads.
   Three major U.S. aerospace companies took on the commercial space
program in earnest, and the McDonnell Douglas Delta was the first to
the launch pad. Martin Marietta has scheduled a commercial launch
with its Titan rocket later this year, and General Dynamics' Atlas
is set to make its debut next year.
   All three rockets are upgraded versions of boosters NASA and the
Air Force have used for several years. The Delta launched Sunday was
the 187th in that series.
   The three companies will compete with each other and with the
well-established Ariane rocket sponsored by the French government
and with a Long March rocket being marketed by the Chinese.
   Several smaller American companies are developing rockets for
boosting small commercial payloads into orbit or on brief suborbital
trips.
   British Satellite Broadcasting in 1987 selected Hughes Aircraft
Co. to build the two Marcopolo satellites under a $300 million
contract.
   McDonnell Douglas is charging Hughes $50 million for each of the
two launches. Hughes will verify the satellites are in orbit and
working before British Satellite accepts them. The second launch is
planned next summer.
   The Air Force will receive more than $1 million for the use of
its launching pad and tracking stations for the initial launch,
according to Sheila M. Carter, a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas.
   Simonds-Gooding said BSB plans to start broadcasting to homes
through the satellite next spring, with customers initially
receiving five channels, four of them free.
   The charge will be about $15 monthly for The Movie Channel, which
shows movies from around the world. The free channels will consist
of Now, for news and sports; Galaxy, devoted to entertainment such
as game shows; a lifestyle channel; and a youth-oriented channel
such as MTV.

   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen Monday,
while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined.
   The dollar closed at 144.28 yen, up 0.75 yen from Friday's close
of 143.53 yen. It opened at 144.20 yen and stayed in a narrow range
of 144.15 to 144.45 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 46.62 points Friday, lost 132.52 more points, or
0.38 percent, closing at 34,607.41.
   Currency dealers said the market was relatively quiet due to a
lack of market-affecting news.
   ``The dollar seesawed in the 144-144.50 yen range in a relatively
bullish mood,'' said a dealer at the Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking
anonymously. ``But it doesn't look like it's going up beyond that
range because of the market's anxiety about possible intervention by
the central bank.''
   Another dealer at the Bank of Tokyo attributed the dollar's
relative firmness to expectations that the U.S. gross national
product is expected to be revised upward for the second quarter in a
Tuesday announcement in Washington.
   ``The dollar rallied with a buying start over speculation that
America's economic growth in the April-June period will be revised
(by the U.S. Commerce Department) to a 2 percent annual level from
its initial 1.7 percent,'' said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who
spoke anonymously.
   He said the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, stepped
into the market on a small scale to stem the dollar's upswing during
early trading. The central bank customarily does not comment on its
market-intervention policy.
   Securities dealers said the stock market's bearishness is being
caused by slight weakening of the Japanese yen against the dollar in
the currency market.

   The discovery of what appears to be
active ice volcanoes on Neptune's moon Triton overshadowed some
other interesting findings by the Voyager 2 spacecraft:
   _A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or take
four minutes. A day is the time the bulk of a planet takes to spin
on its axis.
   _Winds up to more than 700 mph blow in Neptune's atmosphere.
   _Tiny dust particles vaporized in 100,000-degree Fahrenheit
``micro-explosions'' as they hit Voyager when it passed through the
plane of Neptune's rings. An onboard sensor recorded the explosions,
which sound like heavy rain falling on a roof. The particles were
about the size of smoke particles, too small to hurt Voyager.
   _Neptune's south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, are
hotter than the planet's middle latitudes.
   _Neptune's magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from the
poles around which the planet rotates, a much greater tilt than the
minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially estimated. That means
Neptune's magnetic north pole is closer to its equator than to its
rotational north pole. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted 12 degrees
from its true, or rotational, poles.

   Irving Stone, whose pioneering biographical
novels of Vincent Van Gogh, Michelangelo, Sigmund Freud and others
brought history to life for millions, is dead. He was 86.
   Stone died of heart failure late Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center. His family said he had been receiving treatment for cancer
there since July 24.
   With the 1934 epic ``Lust For Life'' about Van Gogh, Stone
perfected the art form of telling history with a human focus. During
the next half-century, he wrote a stream of best-selling
biographical novels, including ``The Agony and the Ecstasy.''
   Doubleday &amp; Co. Inc., Stone's publisher, estimates his books have
sold more than 30 million copies.
   ``The only thing he ever wanted to do was write books and that's
what he did all his life and we did it together,'' his wife and
editor, Jean, said Sunday.
   ``That will be his immortality _ the books he left.''
   She said her husband had been working on a biographical novel
before he was hospitalized and she hoped it could be completed by
someone else. She didn't disclose the subject.
   In a 1985 interview with The Associated Press, Stone explained
his fascination with the biography:
   ``In the biographical novel there's only one person involved. I,
the author, spend two to five years becoming the main character. I
do that so by the time you get to the bottom of page two or three,
you forget your name, where you live, your profession and the year
it is. You become the main character of the book. You live the
book.''
   He took that theory to such extremes that in 1930, on the 40th
anniversary of Van Gogh's death, Stone lay on the bed in the room
where the artist had died at 1:20 a.m. He later said he became more
and more faint ``until finally at 1:19 I threw off the covers,
dashed to the back window, stuck my head out and took in deep
lungsful of the night air.''
   Stone's fictionalized portraits include Jack London in ``Sailor
on Horseback,'' Abraham and Mary Lincoln in ``Love is Eternal,''
Michelangelo in ``The Agony and the Ecstasy,'' Sigmund Freud in
``The Passions of the Mind,'' Charles Darwin in ``The Origin,''
Andrew and Rachel Jackson in ``The President's Lady'' and Eugene V.
Debs in ``Adversary in the House.''
   Herbert Mitgang, cultural correspondent for The New York Times,
said Stone will be remembered as a literary pioneer.
   ``He brought history to millions of people who otherwise might be
not be interested in it,'' Mitgang said.
   Five books were made into movies. ``Lust for Life,'' released in
1956, starred Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh. ``The Agony and the
Ecstasy,'' released in 1965, starred Charlton Heston as Michelangelo.
   ``He had a prodigious talent,'' Heston said Sunday. ``We'll miss
him, but I'm glad we still have his books.''
   Stone was born in San Francisco on July 14, 1903, to Charles and
Pauline Tennenbaum. His parents divorced when he was 7 and he took
his stepfather's surname when his mother remarried.
   He began writing short stories at age 9. He said the following
year, he was inspired to pursue a writing career after he read Jack
London's largely autobiographical novel about a self-made writer,
``Martin Eden.''
   He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1923
with a political science degree and earned a master's degree from
the University of Southern California on an economics fellowship.
   Three years later, Stone went to Paris, where he met
impressionist artists. Out of it came ``Lust For Life,'' which was
turned down by 17 leading publishers.
   Stone recalled in 1984: ``Always with the same comment: How can
you sell a book about an unknown Dutch painter to the American
public in the middle of a depression?''
   Stone finally sold the book to a new publisher, Longmans Green,
after he accepted editing suggestions from his wife, who was his
fiancee at the time.
   In addition to his wife, Stone is survived by their son, Kenneth,
and daughter, Paula.
   A private memorial service will be held at Leo Baeck Temple in
Los Angeles this week. There will be no funeral.

<HEAD>Kiko, Reduced to Tropical Depression, Sputters Toward Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reduced by rough Baja California terrain to
a tropical depression, the remains of Pacific Hurricane Kiko drifted
seaward today.
   Kiko battered the southeastern coast of the sparsely populated
Baja California peninsula with 115 mph winds and dumped up to 11
inches of rain late Saturday and early Sunday but no casualties were
reported.
   The storm toppled trees and electrical poles, sent water gushing
down normally dry gullies and drove 1,300 residents to shelters,
officials said.
   By Sunday night, its winds had died to 35 mph, with higher gusts
and a few squalls, the National Weather Service in Miami said.
   Francisco Zatarain, state security coordinator for Baja
California Sur, said the number left homeless in La Rivera, the town
hardest hit by the storm, was not yet known. Officials said about 20
homes of laminated cardboard and thin wood blew away in the town of
4,000.
   La Rivera is about 75 miles south of La Paz. Zatarin said no
damage was reported in La Paz, the state capital about 760 miles
southeast of San Diego that with 160,000 inhabitants accounts for
half the state's population.
   Early today, the tropical depression was at latitude 24.3 north,
longitude 111.0 west, about 45 miles west-northwest of La Paz.

   It's an uphill climb, they concede, but members of
the Mexican Olympic bobsled team say they still expect someday to
become real competitors in the winter sport.
   That goal comes despite the fact the Tames brothers finished 36th
and 37th at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. And it comes
despite the fact they still have no sled, little money and are
hundreds of miles from the nearest snow.
   The brothers are seriously preparing for another run at breaking
into bobsledding respectability, said Eduardo Tames. They are
raising money for a November training trip to Calgary and hope to
travel to Europe in 1990 for much-needed competition.
   And what's more, Tames said, the team is recruiting.
   ``We're trying to find Mexicans who play college football, who
have the leg strength to get faster starts,'' he said Sunday. ``We
want to have 10 to 12 guys on our team next time.''
   Tames said he and brothers Jorge, Adrian and Roberto, who are
from Guadalajara and work at a Dallas restaurant, plan to go to
several Mexican cities for the recruiting. They would like to take
several new recruits to Calgary for the November practice runs.
   ``We'll have to let them try the sleds,'' he said. ``Sometimes,
they don't like that.''
   For the time being, Tames and his brothers are working out every
morning in Dallas, going out early to beat the searing Texas heat.
Snow is the furthest thing from their minds, he said, as they push
and ride a wheeled cart across a large parking lot to get down their
timing and strengthen their bodies.
   ``We need to be more explosive, to push the sled faster at the
beginning,'' he said.
   They would like to buy their own sled, but that seems like an
idle dream because even used sleds go for $10,000 to $20,000.
   For now, they are simply doing well to afford $1,000 weekly just
to rent a sled during their Canadian training trip and meet the $16
fee they must pay track operators for each practice run.
   Mexican officials were pleased with the team's finish at Calgary
and have already given them permission to represent the financially
struggling country again if the brothers can find their own funding
for the 1992 games.
   Wearing red and white donated uniforms, the brothers finished
ahead of Portugal, a Japanese team, one from the Virgin Islands and
a U.S. entry that abandoned its last run.
   ``We didn't finish last in 1988 so that was pretty good for us,''
Tames said. ``We definitely want to improve that performance.''
   Improvement will be a costly endeavor, and a medal is an
unthinkable goal, but Tames says nothing can beat the thrill he and
his brothers find in bobsledding.
   ``It's really different from anything I've ever tried before,''
he said, adding that no amusement park roller coaster can even come
close.
   ``The only way you can tell if you're going to like it is to try
the sled. It's really scary. It's really fast until your reflexes
and eyes adjust to the speed you're running.''

   A United Airlines Boeing 767 with 215 people aboard
was forced to return to Stapleton International Airport after
takeoff when it experienced hydraulic trouble in its landing gear,
authorities said.
   No one was hurt in Sunday night's incident.
   The hydraulic problems were in the left main landing gear, said
Stapleton spokesman Jack McGuire. He said he assumed from the
uneventful return of the plane that the gear must have stayed down
after the takeoff.
   McGuire did not know what time the plane took off for New York,
but said it reported trouble eight minutes into the flight and was
reported back at the gate at 9:35 p.m. MDT.
   United Airlines spokesman Jack Ekey in Denver declined to comment.
   A passenger who spoke on condition of anonymity said the plane
took off at about 7 p.m. About 1{ hours into the flight, he said,
the pilot reported a problem, and later said it was leaking brake
fluid.

   A brawl in which inmates brandished barbells
injured 32 men at a medium-security prison, authorities said.
   About 200 inmates at the Cayuga Correctional Facility were in the
yard near some weight-lifting equipment when the fight broke out
Sunday night, said state corrections spokesman James Flateau.
   Guards broke up the fight and had the inmates back in their
dormitories within an hour, he said.
   ``The prison is secure,'' Flateau said early today.
   Six inmates were taken to a hospital Sunday night, and 26 were
treated at the prison infirmary, mostly for cuts and bruises,
Flateau said. No guards were hurt, he said.
   One of the six sent for outside treatment was seriously injured
and was being evaluated early today, said Art Perry, a Cortland
Memorial Hospital spokesman. The five other inmates were treated for
cuts and bruises.
   Officials at the central New York prison do not know what started
the fight.

<HEAD>Bear's Skull Found on Elizabethan Theater Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skull of a bear has been unearthed on the site
of the Elizabethan Rose Theater, where William Shakespeare is
believed to have acted and near where bear-baiting was first
recorded in the 1500s.
   Dr. Sebastian Payne of the Historic Buildings and Monuments
Commission, who examined the skull, was quoted in The Times of
London today as saying the animal was believed to be a mature adult
European brown bear.
   He said the canine teeth were broken off, possibly to make the
bear less dangerous to humans and dogs and because the teeth were
subsequently worn smooth, the animal must have survived its ordeal
for some time. He said the skull appeared to have come from a ditch
that contained debris dating from 1587-1606, when the Rose Theater
was flourishing.
   Bears were brought to Britain to undergo the torments of attacks
by dogs for the entertainment of paying spectators. The discovery of
the skull may indicate the Rose was used for entertainment other
than drama.
   The Rose site is near the more famous Globe Theater. Both stood
on the south bank of the Thames River by Southwark Bridge.
   The foundations of the Rose were discovered earlier this year
during demolition to build an office; they are the only relics of an
Elizabethan theater yet found.
   The acting profession demonstrated for weeks to try to have the
site preserved as a permanent exhibit but the campaign was
unsuccessful.

<HEAD>Solar-Powered Commuter Car Only a Few Years Off, Entrepreneur Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Skeptics say solar-powered cars still
aren't feasible. But James Worden commutes to work every day in a
solar car he built himself.
   The car is a 350-pound, silver three-wheeler covered with solar
panels that suggests a cross between a golf cart and a Honda Civic.
It holds two people, can reach 35 mph, and for four years has taken
him on his regular 13-mile commute.
   Worden keeps it parked in a sunny spot outside his lab at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. When he drives it at night,
or takes it more than about 50 miles, he plugs it into an ordinary
electric outlet to recharge its nickel-cadmium battery.
   Worden easily kept up with traffic during a recent spin through
crowded Cambridge, where the most significant trouble the car
encountered was giant potholes.
   One advantage was its silence.
   ``Has it stalled?'' a passenger inquired as the car sat
noiselessly waiting for a green light.
   ``No,'' Worden replied, ``it's recharging.''
   In a month or two, the 22-year-old entrepreneur expects to
produce a four-wheel prototype that will look more like a more
traditional automobile.
   ``We hope to be making a car a day in two years,'' said Worden,
who was a high school student when he built his first solar car and
had yet to graduate from MIT when he founded his company,
Solelectron Corp.
   Worden said his next generation solar-electric commuter car will
weigh 800 to 1,000 pounds, accommodate two people plus 300 pounds of
cargo and reach 45 mph. It also will be able to go for 40 miles at
night and 60 miles in full sunlight before recharging.
   ``It's a city car,'' Worden said. ``The idea is, it'll be
sprightly and clean and easy. There's no gas and no fuel charge and
no oil changes. You'll never have to get a brake job. ... There
won't be a muffler either. ... The only service you'll need, except
the tires, is watering the battery every year or so.''
   The car should sell for about $10,000, Worden said. Extra solar
panels, which could be left on a roof for recharging, would cost
another $500 to $1,000.
   Solelectron also is working on a $20,000 racing car model to go
faster and farther.
   His four-wheel commuter car has limitations. In full sunlight, it
will go only 20 mph before drawing on its high-tech lead battery.
Parked a full day in the sun, it will soak up only enough light to
run 40 miles. Recharging the battery will take up to five hours.
   Still, Worden and other entrepreneurs of solar energy say that
smog, ozone depletion and global warming make electric cars more
attractive, even in places where frequently cloudy skies obscure the
sunlight.
   Solar-electric cars are on the market in Europe. For instance, a
Swiss compact sells for about $20,600.
   Some proponents, such as Robert Wills, an engineer at Dartmouth
College, predict solar cars will be commercially available in this
country before the end of the century.
   ``There just aren't any better solutions to air pollution in the
major cities,'' said Wills, an organizer of the New England Tour De
Sol solar car races.
   At the same time, solar technology has advanced enormously in
recent years, due in part to lessons learned from long-distance
solar car races.
   In 1987, General Motors' Sunraycer was driven 1,950 miles across
Australia in 5{ days, averaging 41.5 mph. And just this summer,
Worden's racing car, the 270-pound Solectria, drove 3,200 miles from
Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., in two weeks, with few troubles
other than some flat tires.
   But although GM has learned much about engineering lightweight
solar cars from the Sunraycer, ``we feel this probably has more
application to a lightweight efficient electric commuter car than to
a solar car,'' said GM spokesman Bruce McCristal in Detroit.
   McCristal would not say whether GM is working on an electric car.
   Many observers still believe that barring soaring gasoline prices
or regulatory incentives offered by states trying to reduce air
pollution, widespread use of solar cars is a long way off.
   ``I would agree with Worden that he has a vehicle that can easily
encompass the needs of the average commuter, but whether the
commuter will buy it is another question,'' said Edward A. Campbell,
publisher of Alternate Energy Transportation, a monthly newsletter
based in New York.
   ``Will the commuter accept something that can only go 40 miles a
day and has to be laid up at night?''

<HEAD>Poll: Teachers Feel Less Computer Literate Than Their Students</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly nine of 10 classroom teachers consider the
computer revolution a boon to education, but a majority also feels
less computer-literate than their students, according to a poll.
   Fifty-nine percent believe teachers are inadequately trained in
computer use, according to the poll released Sunday, ``The Computer
Report Card: How Teachers Grade Computers in the Classroom,''
commissioned by International Business Machines Corp.
   Two-thirds of U.S. teachers now use classroom computers, but 52
percent said they felt less computer literate than their students.
   Fifty-seven percent said they did not own a personal computer at
home.
   The poll, conducted by The Wirthlin Group, a New York-based
polling organization, was based on telephone interviews of 1,100
teachers in all 50 states randomly selected from a list of
approximately 250,000 precollegiate teachers compiled by the Dunhill
International List Co. It was conducted between July 6-9, and had a
sampling margin of error of plus or minus 3 points.
   The IBM survey echoed the sentiments of a report in July by the 2
million-member National Education Association, stating that
``schools are not doing enough to help teachers become familiar and
comfortable with computers.''
   The teacher union's report found that only one-third of
kindergarten-through 12th-grade teachers had even 10 hours of
computer training.
   Still, the IBM poll found 59 percent of teachers believe
computers are being used effectively for instruction, 85 percent
think they've had a positive impact on education, and 88 percent
reject the idea that computers are a passing fad.
   And while 43 percent said computers made teaching less difficult,
45 percent said the technology hadn't affected the difficulty of
their jobs and 9 percent said it had made their jobs harder. The
rest offered no opinion.
   ``Teachers are saying that technology has a place in the
classroom, but they have to be given the training to use the
equipment for personal use or as a teaching isntrument,'' Mary
Hatwood Futrell, outgoing president of the NEA, said in an interview.
   ``A pleasant surprise was the number of teachers who believe we
should use technology more extensively than we do now,'' she said.
``I hope the survey sends a clear message to colleges and to school
districts that teachers want to use technology and that they need
training.''
   Computers, a rarity in U.S. schools a decade ago, are now in
virtually every school district.
   Other poll highlights:
   _ 77 percent agreed that computer use could lessen the need for
academic tracking because they allow for more individualized
instruction in the same classroom;
   _ 91 percent believed computers can help develop basic skills in
reading and writing, and 66 percent said computers aren't being used
enough toward those ends;
   _ 82 percent said computers increased students' motivation for
learning;
   _ 68 percent considered cost the greatest obstacles to effective
use of computers;
   _ 77 percent agreed that computers will never replace textbooks
as instructional tools;
   _ 70 percent do not like the focus on drill and practice software.

<HEAD>Lesbian Alleges Spouse Abuse in Murder Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with murdering her
lesbian lover is using the ``battered spouse syndrome'' as her
defense, authorities said.
   Defense lawyers for Annette Green, 30, planned to argue that she
killed her 32-year-old live-in lover, Ivonne Julio, because Ms.
Julio beat and humiliated her repeatedly during their 11-year
relationship.
   The trial was scheduled to begin today in Palm Beach County
Circuit Court.
   Ms. Green's defense is considered novel because the battered
spouse syndrome is usually ascribed to women who suffer repeated
beatings by male partners.
   ``This is a new issue,'' said New York University law Professor
Holly Maguigan, an expert on domestic violence. ``But it is not
surprising. ... The dynamics in a same-sex relationship are often
similar to those in a heterosexual relationship.''
   Ms. Green shot Ms. Julio with a bullet to the brain on Oct. 30,
1988, following a Halloween party and a fight in a trailer park in
unincorporated Palm Beach County, according to police.
   ``She would have killed me because she is very violent,'' Ms.
Green told police after the killing.
   Ms. Green told police that Ms. Julio had beaten her more than 100
times since 1977, when they became lovers. Ms. Julio, two years
older and 70 pounds heavier, used to strike Ms. Green without
warning, Ms. Green said.
   Police said Ms. Green admitted that she was not in immediate
danger when she shot Ms. Julio, who was kneeling in a closet.
   Assistant State Attorney Bob Johnson has asked the court to
exclude testimony on the battered spouse syndrome as it applies to
lesbians because of a lack of adequate research.
   Circuit Judge Tony Waddell has not ruled on the issue.
   Johnson said he will seek the death penalty if Ms. Green is
convicted.
   A doctor hired by the defense found evidence Ms. Green had
suffered ``multiple head injuries.'' Acquaintances said the couple
argued frequently and their arguments often dissolved into violence.
   Defense attorney William Lasley said Ms. Green did not leave Ms.
Julio out of concern for Ms. Julio's twin 14-year-old daughters.
   Lasley said Ms. Green ``adopted'' the teen-agers and acted as
their mother, protecting them from Ms. Julio.

<HEAD>Three Bell Subsidiaries Continue Strike Talks After Two Others Settle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bell of Pennsylvania reached agreement with its largest union
early today, and progress was reported in settling phone strikes
around the country.
   Ohio Bell and Wisconsin Bell reached tentative agreements with
the Communication Workers of America during the weekend, and talks
continued with the other three companies that make up Chicago-based
Ameritech.
   ``Negotiations are continuing to progress'' in Illinois, Indiana
and Michigan, said Ameritech spokesman Steve Ford, ``and we're
hopeful that settlements will be reached in the not-too-distant
future.''
   In New York, NYNEX Corp. plans to resume bargaining with striking
workers Wednesday, the first formal talks since that walkout started
almost three weeks ago. The regional company serves New York and
most of New England.
   Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states went on strike earlier
this month against four of the so-called ``Baby Bell'' regional
telephone companies formed after the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T. Tentative
settlements have been reached at Pacific Telesis, which serves
California and Nevada; and Bell Atlantic, which covers West
Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Washington,
D.C., and New Jersey.
   While talks continued on local issues for some Bell Atlantic
units, Bell of Pennsylvania tentatively agreed on a new contract
with CWA Local 13000, representing more than 8,900 employees.
   Union spokesman Alex Minishak said the settlement offers gains in
such areas as vacations, layoffs and the use of contract labor.
   In the Midwest, Ohio Bell on Saturday agreed to a tentative
three-year contract with 10,000 CWA members. Wisconsin Bell settled
with its 4,200 striking employees Sunday.
   Neither side would discuss details of the contract.
   Talks with Bell subsidiaries in Illinois, Michigan and Indiana
recessed Sunday night. Negotiators were scheduled to meet again
today, officials said.
   ``There's certainly momentum all around at this point, and we're
hopeful to reach settlements with all the companies,'' said CWA
spokesman Steve Rosenthal.
   ``We made excellent progress today and feel we're very close.
Only a few minor details need to be worked out,'' said Indiana Bell
spokesman Dennis McCabe after the two sides recessed their
negotiations.
   The union said pickets will remain up where settlements have been
reached until there are agreements in the other states.
   But Ohio Bell said its expects employees to return to work.
   ``It has been the company's point of view that we, in fact, have
reached an agreement and what is going on elsewhere should not have
an effect on our employees,'' said Mary Lou Ringle, spokeswoman for
Ohio Bell's Cleveland office.
   About 35,000 CWA members struck the five Ameritech companies Aug.
13, and there was little progress in bargaining until late last week.
   In addition to the Bell companies, a settlement was reached
between the CWA and Ameritech Services, a subsidiary employing about
600 warehouse workers in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Wages had been the issue in all five of the Ameritech companies,
with the union balking at offers to pay a one-time, lump-sum amount
as a part of any negotiated increase.
   ``We paved the way to a settlement by moving some of the lump-sum
money into wage increases'' in Ohio, Rosenthal said. ``Hopefully we
can do the same in the other companies.''

<DATELINE>YAMALES, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of armed Contra soldiers are
preparing to defy a regional peace accord and march back into
Nicaragua despite a lack of U.S. support.
   ``We will wait in the mountains for the changes that (President
Daniel) Ortega has promised,'' said Contra chief of staff Israel
Galeano, known as Commander Franklin.
   ``We aren't going to launch offensive operations because we don't
have enough supplies, but we will defend ourselves if attacked,'' he
said Saturday in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government has promised democratic
reforms and set an election for Feb. 25, 1990, in accordance with an
agreement signed by Central American presidents on Aug. 7 in Tela,
Honduras.
   The accord also called for disbanding the Nicaraguan Resistance
army by Dec. 8, with a United Nations team to observe the process.
   ``By the time the U.N. gets here, we'll be gone,'' said
``Commander Henry,'' head of the rebel medical corps.
   Most of the army fighting to oust the Sandinista government has
been camped in Honduras along the Nicaraguan border since U.S.
military aid was suspended a year-and-half ago.
   The isolated camps are strung out along the narrow Yamales River
valley 30 miles from the nearest paved road. Weakened by desertions
and shortages of supplies and medicine, the army has by and large
retained its integrity and spirit.
   ``We have too few bullets and too much morale,'' said Galeano.
   He and other field commanders say an intact fighting force will
pressure the Sandinistas into fulfilling their democratic promises
to a war-weary nation.
   ``What can the U.N. do if Ortega cheats?'' asked one soldier, who
had taken the battle name ``Danilo.'' ``Look what happened in
Panama,'' where Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega retains his grip on
power despite U.S. and other international opposition.
   Battle-hardened commanders express contempt for ``politicians''
of the Nicaraguan Directorate in Miami.
   ``We've kicked out the desk soldiers. They lost touch with the
fighters,'' said ``Commander Dimas,'' one of a group of young field
commanders who now make up the general staff.
   U.S. officials say they fear that Contras who return to Nicaragua
will be wiped out by the vastly larger Sandinista army, and Contra
commanders said they had been asked to wait at least until Dec. 8
before making a move.
   ``The gringos think everything in Central America runs on their
money. They think that without their money and their supplies we'll
just go away,'' said Dimas.
   ``Now we're thinking about this entirely from the point of view
of our own interests,'' he said.
   Non-lethal aid has continued, and U.S. officials point
energetically to literacy and civics courses, barber and cooking
classes and even a course in public speaking as examples of the
current U.S. effort.
   But many Contras now see the aid as irrelevant and even damaging,
because it made them seem a creature of the United States rather
than an indigenous guerrilla force created by Sandinista oppression.
   Withdrawal of the aid is viewed as immoral, and some said U.S.
advisers didn't seem to realize they were in a war.
   ``They were always telling us, `Oh no, don't attack that bridge,
don't attack that factory, Congress will get mad,'' said ``Henry.''
   The army is made up almost entirely of peasant farmers,
sharecroppers and ranchers who fled the Sandinista government's land
seizures and collectivization efforts. Many now have families in the
camps, in nearby villages or in refugee camps in eastern Honduras.
   Commanders and soldiers alike said they began their fight without
expecting U.S. aid.
   ``I started with a .22 rifle after they tried to make me join a
collective,'' said ``Pavon,'' or ``Big Bird,'' a member of the Jorge
Salazar No. 5 battlion.
   But despite defiance, the army knows it is alone, short of
ammunition and with little hope of outside help. An outbreak of
meningitis has killed three children and left others ill.
   ``What do you know about Canada's rules on asylum?'' asked a
fighter named ``Freddy'' when he was alone with a journalist. ``Is
there a lot of work there?''
   Freddy said he had joined the Contras to avoid the draft. ``I
avoided two years of service, but now I've been fighting for six,''
he said.
   Mariana Amador said she walked 10 miles from a village to collect
her son, who had decided to desert from an Contra artillery unit.
   ``He got nervous when they started talking about going back into
Nicaragua,'' she said.
   Where there were 11,000 men in early February, there are now
6,000 to 7,000.
   Commanders claim 2,500 fighters have already left for Nicaragua.
While no one wanted to discuss desertions, some companies that
should have 200 men could muster only 120.
   ``We're purifying ourselves,'' said Commander Nolan, the leader
of a combined battalion. ``The weak and the corrupt are leaving.''
   Ortega and the Sandinistas have been making an effort to convince
the Contras that it is safe to return. Sandinista and Contra field
commanders have held impromptu talks.
   But the fighters are skeptical about Sandinista promises, saying
that Ortega has yet to prove he can keep a promise.

   Ten banks were blown up by bombs in the
cocaine manufacturing center of Medellin, and local reports said the
justice minister who was leading a crackdown on drug lords has fled
to the United States in fear of her life.
   News reports also said Sunday that an appeals court revoked an
arrest order accusing a top drug kingpin of ordering two
assassinations.
   The bombs that went off throughout Colombia's second-largest city
early Sunday caused extensive damage to seven branches of the
government-owned Banco Cafetero and three branches of the private
Banco de Colombia and Banco del Estado, authorities said.
   A police spokesman said a young man was killed, apparently while
planting one of the bombs.
   Police refused to say which organization was responsible for the
bombings. Other attacks in recent months were conducted by leftist
guerrillas that sometimes cooperate with drug traffickers.
   The spokesman said police patrols in Medellin, 215 miles north of
Bogota, were tightened to prevent new attacks. He said extra units
were stationed throughout Medellin to protect private and public
buildings.
   The city is hometown for the Medellin Cartel, the world's biggest
drug organization and reportedly responsible for 80 percent of the
cocaine sent by air, sea and land to the United States.
   President Virgilio Barco meanwhile ``denied reports related to
the resignation of the justice minister,'' Monica de Greiff, but he
failed to clarify whether the minister had actually resigned,
according to a communique late Sunday.
   The presidential communique followed a weekend of speculation
over the alleged desertion of Mrs. de Greiff at a time when the
government is conducting an unprecedented campaign against the drug
lords.
   Newspapers, radio networks and television stations repeatedly
reported Sunday that Mrs. de Greiff had resigned after less than two
months in charge.
   Asked to clarify the communique, a spokesman at the Presidential
Press Office said, ``I cannot add a single word to the document.''
   Mrs. de Greiff, 32, had been the target of death threats against
her, her husband and their 3-year-old child since the government
launched a nationwide crackdown on drug traffickers after a string
of killings that included presidential candidate Sen. Luis Carlos
Galan on Aug. 18.
   Since Galan's death, the government has arrested more than 11,000
people and seized hundreds of millions of dollars in property. The
United States last week pledged $65 million in helicopters and other
military aid for the government effort.
   Rumors of Mrs. de Greiff's resignation circulated after a TV
interview last week in which she said, ``I wasn't prepared to work
in times of war, such as now.''
   Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, a predecessor of Mrs. de Greiff, was killed
by drug hitmen in 1984.
   Last week, the traffickers declared war after the government
began a crackdown in response to the assassinations of a magistrate,
a police colonel and Sen. Galan over a 48-hour period.
   The presidential communique on Mrs. de Greiff appeared untimely,
as the government was calling on Colombians to become ``fighters for
the moral'' and help them defeat the cocaine traffickers.
   She traveled to Washington on Friday where she was scheduled to
confer with U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on extradition of
arrested drug suspects. But she failed to show up at the meeting and
no explanation was given by Colombian authorities.
   Thornburgh said Sunday that Mrs. de Greiff would be welcome in
United States if she applied for refugee status to escape from
political prosecution.
   Private radio network Caracol said Mrs. de Greiff had told
President Barco she wanted to resign. Other news reports said she
would be replaced temporarily by Communications Minister Carlos
Lemos Simmonds.
   The newspaper El Tiempo reported Sunday that a court has struck
down an arrest order for Medellin cartel boss Pablo Escobar that
accused him of ordering the massacre of peasants at two ranches by
right-wing death squads.
   But El Tiempo said a three-judge panel reversed its ruling Aug.
15, deciding there was insufficient evidence against Escobar, who
formed a trafficking organization in the mid-1970s and has
repeatedly terrorized the judicial system with assassinations and
threats, according to police.
   No such reversal was reported at the time, and it was not
immediately possible to confirm the report Sunday.
   Meanwhile in Jerusalem, police opened an inquiry Sunday into
Israelis suspected of training death squads for Colombian drug
barons, and a retired army officer named in the scandal said the
probe could implicate other officers and a legislator.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Israel television the
allegations contained a ``certain amount of exaggeration.'' He said
the government had no part in the scandal.

   Relatives warned Jose Enrique
Menendez that criminals prey on the rich. But he kept the gates
unlocked at his $4 million Beverly Hills house, with its tennis
court and Mercedes-Benz outside.
   And that could have made it easy for mobsters to get him, his
sister said outside a memorial for the slain Hollywood executive.
   ``We think he made the mistake of buying a business that had been
used before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run it
straight,'' Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., said
Friday.
   Her brother, Jose E. Menendez, was found shot to death the night
of Aug. 20 along with his 44-year-old wife, Kitty, in their
Spanish-style mansion.
   About all police would say was that nothing had been ruled out.
   The Cuban-born Menendez, 45, once headed RCA-Ariola Records as
well as the U.S. rental car operations for the Hertz Corp.
   He was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of Live
Entertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc. in the
video and music distribution business, and had been praised for
improving the company's performance.
   Two of the three companies operated by Live Entertainment had
been linked to organized crime before Live Entertainment bought
them. Live Entertainment acting President Roger R. Smith has
vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link.
   Ms. Menendez-Cano and former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, a friend for
nearly a decade, described Menendez as absolutely honest, although
an extremely aggressive businessman.
   ``Sometimes he had to tell people things they didn't want to
hear,'' Curb said. ``But he was a wonderful guy, an absolutely
outstanding person. I just can't believe something like this could
happen.''
   Curb and Ms. Menendez-Cano spoke outside the memorial service at
the Directors Guild of America in Hollywood, where 400 people
listened to eulogies by the Menendezes sons, Eric, 18, and Lyle, 22.
   Ms. Menendez-Cano said her brother had tried to keep the video
business clean.
   ``The first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business,''
she said. ``Because of his success, he probably was stepping on many
shoes, which some people didn't like.''
   International Video Entertainment, which Live Entertainment
purchased in 1986, had been owned by Noel C. Bloom. Bloom was
identified in a California attorney general's report on organized
crime that year as a major distributor of X-rated movies and a
former associate of the late Michael Zaffarano of the Bonanno
organized-crime family.
   Peter Hoffman, Carolco's president and chief executive, said
International Video Entertainment itself was never involved in
pornography.
   The other company with a crime-linked past was BeckZack Corp.,
which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailing
chain in the Northeast. Live Entertainment completed its acquisition
of BeckZack this June.
   BeckZack's principal shareholder, Morris Levy, was convicted in
May 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler.
He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction.
   An FBI affidavit filed in federal court in New York in connection
with an investigation of Levy quoted an unidentified informant as
saying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interest
in the Strawberries chain. The documents called Levy ``a lucrative
source of cash and property'' for Genovese leaders.
   Andrew Nichols, the Boston lawyer who represented Levy in the
sale of Strawberries to Live Entertainment for about $40.5 million,
said he is certain the company had no crime connections at the time
of the sale.
   And Live Entertainment officials said they even checked with
federal organized crime investigators, who said they were unaware of
any such links to Strawberries.
   Ms. Menendez-Cano said her brother had big plans to expand. ``He
said he would be controlling the East Coast video business, through
his careful planning, in the next couple of years.''
   She said her brother refused to listen when she warned him about
leaving the house unlocked.
   ``We told him that there were burglars, criminals in the
neighborhood,'' she said.
   Menendez and his wife had been looking to the future, building an
8,000-square-foot dream house above Los Angeles.
   Then their sons found their bullet-riddled bodies.
   Menendez would want his business associates and friends to keep
up the fight, his younger son told the mourners.
   Eric Menendez recalled how his father kept a portrait of the
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in the house, and
adopted as his motto King's declaration of hope _ ``I have a dream.''

<HEAD>Liberal Democrat-Backed Candidate Wins Closely Watched Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first mayoral election since the
scandal-tainted Liberal Democratic Party lost its dominance in the
upper house of Parliament, a candidate backed by the conservative
party has defeated a divided opposition.
   The vote Sunday in Kyoto, 90 miles west of Tokyo, was considered
an indication of how the conservative governing party will fare in
upcoming national balloting.
   Tomoyuki Tanabe, 64, defeated Communist Party candidate Manpei
Kimura by 321 votes, the Kyoto Election Committee said.
   In July, the Liberal Democrats lost a majority in the upper house
of Parliament for the first time in 34 years. Their poor election
showing was attributed to an unpopular sales tax, and
influence-peddling and sex scandals involving party members.
   Elections for the more powerful lower house, which appoints the
prime minister, are due by next summer and political analysts said
the governing party may have a fight on its hands.
   All nine candidates in Sunday's election called for abolition of
the 3 percent sales tax imposed April 1.
   Kyoto is considered symbolically important as Japan's ancient
capital and as a district that in the late 1970s swung from nearly
three decades of mostly Communist local government to a Liberal
Democratic-led coalition.
   Tanabe, an independent candidate endorsed by the Liberal
Democrats, won the race with 148,836 votes. Kimura, 65, received
148,515 votes, the Election Committee said.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said he was relieved by Sunday's
victory.
   It was the first mayoral election since the Kaifu administration
was inaugurated on Aug. 9.
   Kaifu replaced Sousuke Uno, who held office for just 69 days
before stepping down amid accusations he had paid mistresses.

<HEAD>Crack Creeps Into Chicago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crack cocaine is becoming more prevalent in the
Chicago suburbs, and police fear the city may no longer remain
relatively untouched by the drug.
   ``It's virgin soil,'' says Lt. Harold Jenkins of the Maywood
Police Department. ``Dealers figure they can come here and start
their own thing.''
   Authorities are uncertain why crack _ popular among drug users
for years in other cities _ had been so scarce here. One theory is
that local drug kingpins kept the drug out of the area because they
feared it would cut into their profitable trafficking in powder
cocaine and heroin.
   Now, crack is becoming a problem in some of the poorer southern
suburbs, and police fear poor city neighborhoods could be next.
   In suburban Harvey, 539 drug arrests were made last year, and
police say 95 percent of the narcotics trade in that suburb involves
crack, a smokable form of cocaine.
   Crack dealers, police said, have invaded other urban centers by
first establishing footholds first in outlying communities.
   One dose of crack provides a much more intense high than cocaine
in powder form and sells for less money. As a result, crack is
popular in poorer communities and among the young.
   For years, Chicago police have focused their drug activities on
powder cocaine and heroin abuse. While other cities reeled under
soaring homicide rates due to crack, Chicago's homicide rate in 1988
dropped to its lowest level in 20 years.
   Officials say the full extent of crack abuse in Chicago has not
been determined. From February to June, police raided 20 crack
houses, said Sgt. Jim Brady.
   Chicago gangs are believed to be playing a key role in
distributing crack in the suburbs, and police are checking into
reports that Los Angeles street gangs may be involved. They have
introduced crack into Kansas City, Mo., Minneapolis and other cities.
   Police in suburban Robbins say their town has become known on the
street as ``Rockville'' because so much crack cocaine is sold there
in rock form.
   On most nights, dozens of dealers sell crack openly in alleys and
parking lots and on street corners, said Sgt. Charles Harris.

<HEAD>Troops Force Open Shops as Sinhalese Strike Begins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops forced open shops in the capital
and its suburbs today, the first day of a weeklong strike to protest
alleged killings of Sinhalese militants and to demand the withdrawal
of Indian soldiers.
   Heavily armed soldiers in combat gear drove around Colombo
warning shop owners to open and troops broke the locks of shops
whose owners refused. Most subsequently opened their establishments
but some said they did because they feared the military.
   Few buses rolled through the capital and soldiers were posted at
nearly every corner, witnesses said.
   Troops also prevented cameramen from taking pictures of the
military actions and at least two photographers had their film rolls
exposed by the military.
   No clashes or other violence were immediately reported. But
military officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said 235 suspected Sinhalese radicals had been rounded up since
Sunday in central and southern Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese heartland.
   Inspector General of Police Ernest Perera also ordered all police
on alert after intelligence reports were received that said
Sinhalese extremists planned to attack police stations during the
strike, military officials said.
   The strike was called by National Workers Action Front, the trade
union wing of the People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese
group waging a violent 2-year-old campaign against the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   Sinhalese radicals oppose the government's peace plan granting
limited autonomy to Tamils in the north and east. Indian troops were
invited to the island in July 1987 to help enforce the initiative
but the government now wants them out. India says a quick withdrawal
could lead to further violence.
   Posters put up in Colombo by the militants demanded that
residents stay indoors and not open for business. Counter-posters,
believed to have been put up by pro-government groups, said anyone
who heeded the strike call would be treated as a traitor.
   At least 5,000 people have been killed in the campaign by
Sinhalese ultranationalists. Human rights organizations and
opposition politicans say many of the victims have been suspected
radicals shot after capture by security forces. In past weeks,
military officials have reported scores of unidentified bodies
turning up in various parts of the island every day.
   Another 11,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection that
began in 1983 in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   Sinhalese, who are mainly Buddhist and make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, dominate the government and military.
Tamils, who are mainly Hindu and comprise about 18 percent of the
island's population, say they are discriminated against by the
ethnic majority in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.
   India, the dominant military power in the region, moved in troops
because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils to the rebel
cause. But the soldiers soon began fighting the rebels it once
supported after a major Tamil militia rejected the peace plan.

   Actor Stacy Keach is in the hot seat, driving a
borrowed Cadillac in a loaner program that has had a run of bad luck.
   Cadillac dealer Alice DeSanders still is loaning cars to visiting
stars of the Dallas Summer Musicals although two vehicles have been

   ``Thank goodness no one has been hurt,'' Ms. DeSanders said.
``But maybe it's a good thing the 1990 Cadillacs have air bags as
standard equipment.''
   The bad luck streak started when Debbie Reynolds, who starred in
``The Unsinkable Molly Brown'' was driving her loaner car and was
hit by a truck. She was given another vehicle, which was stolen from
the music hall's parking lot.
   During the run of ``Godspell,'' star Adrian Zmed was driving one

towed on a freeway.
   Keach is appearing in ``The King and I.''

<HEAD>UAW Employees at Diamond-Star Ratify New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first United Auto Workers contract with
Diamond-Star Motors provides a firm foundation for labor progress at
the Chrysler-Mitsubishi joint venture, union officials said.
   Many union members praised the three-year pact ratified Sunday,
which provides wage and benefit increases of more than 30 percent.
   The vote was 1,258 in favor to 383 against, said UAW spokesman
Dennis Miller.
   The $650 million Diamond-Star Motors plant began making cars
about a year ago. The company, which employs about 2,900 people,
produces sporty two-door sedans marketed as the Plymouth Laser and
the Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   Diamond-Star negotiators said Sunday they also were satisfied
with the contract.
   ``I think it's fair for both the company and the workers,'' said
Iven Boehm, a Diamond-Star spokesman.
   Under the agreement, production workers who have been on the job
18 months get a base wage of $12.79 an hour, increasing to $17.01 an
hour at the end of the three-year contract.
   Maintenance workers, including skilled positions such as
electricians and welders, begin at $14.89 an hour and increase to
$19.49 at the end of three years.
   The raises are intended to bring the wages of Diamond-Star
workers into line with those of workers at other UAW-represented
auto plants, and specifically with Chrysler plants.
   The contract ncludes a ``me too'' provision that passes on to
Diamond-Star workers any Chrysler increases that occur during the
pact.
   The job security provisions in the contract are ``among the
strongest in the industry,'' according to a letter to members of UAW
Local 2488 from Bill Stewart, regional director.
   The company agreed not to lay off workers ``unless compelled to
do so by severe economic conditions that threaten the long-term life
of the company.''
   Before laying off workers, the company would cut salaries of
officers and management.

   Lutherans worked on a compromise approach
to abortion, an issue that in the past divided the three

   A motion was submitted Sunday at the church's eight-day
legislative assembly, which ends Wednesday, asking individuals ``to
act on their Christian convictions'' while the church makes a
long-range study.
   The motion, by Louise Shoemaker of Philadelphia, was to supplant
a resolutions committee proposal calling simply for a church study,
and for people to use prior church guidance.
   The Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and
the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches merged into the
5.3-million member church on Jan. 1, 1988. The three denominations
had taken varying positions on abortion.
   The substitute motion, which reportedly satisfied a women's
caucus that had sought church action to oppose restrictions on
abortion, said church advocacy should involve appealing for ``free
access to services for individuals'' and ``work for justice,
especially with and for the poor.''
   Meanwhile, anti-abortion pickets showed up outside the O'Hare
Exposition Center where the new church's first policy-making
assembly is being held with signs reading:
   ``ELCA: It's Your Baby Now,'' ``Abortion Stops A Beating Heart''
and ``Lutheran General, Stop Killing.''
   The pickets said they were mostly from a group that for two years
has been picketing Lutheran General Hospital in nearby Park Ridge,
Ill., which performs abortions.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, the church's president, said in a
letter that the hospital does not provide abortion on demand. He
also was quoted as saying the hospital aborts only fetuses so
seriously abnormal they would die before or at birth.
   Meanwhile, the assembly delayed action on whether to set a
deadline for its pension board to sell off stock in companies doing
business in South Africa.
   The board has $1.6 billion in assets, $84.9 million invested in
companies operating in South Africa. It says it is gradually
reducing the holdings but must do so gradually to be financially
prudent.
   One group, Pension Members for Justice, is pressing for a
deadline of Sept. 1, 1991, to get rid of the holdings.
   Several denominations _ including the United Church of Christ,
the Episcopal Church, the Church of the Brethren and the Quakers _
have decided to sell all stock in companies operating in South
Africa.
   The disinvestment campaign's aim is to push South Africa to end
its system of racial separation and domination of 28 million blacks
by 5 million whites.

   Customs officials stopped a Briton and his

bag they were carrying, a police source said.
   Bahgat Saeedeen el-Murabet, a naturalized Briton of Libyan
origin, and his wife Olia, were going through a security check
Sunday at Cairo International Airport when the 6{-pound gold belt
was found, said the source.
   The couple, who missed their flight to London, face questioning

out the gold belt.
   The source was unable to give the couple's hometowns and British

   The Italian air force stunt team
involved in the air disaster a year ago today at Ramstein, West
Germany, made its first public performance since the accident that
killed 70 people.
   The Freece Tricolori's nine Aermachi jets on Sunday flew several
aerobatic stunts over an airport near this southern town, including
a modified version of the ``pierced heart'' routine in which three
planes crashed into each other last Aug. 28.
   ``We cannot forget what happened, but you have to overcome that

Forno.
   The team performed more than 1,300 feet from the crowd of several
thousand people, almost twice the distance they used at Ramstein Air
Base a year ago.

   Poor weather in the rugged Korakoram
Mountains stalled search efforts today for a Pakistani airliner that
disappeared three days ago with 54 people aboard.
   ``Today the weather is very bad. We haven't been able to operate
any flights in the area,'' said A.M. Sarooqi, a spokesman for
Pakistan International Airlines.
   Two British trekkers who reported sighting a low-flying aircraft
Friday near 26,606-foot Nanga Parbat, or Naked Mountain, were to
lead a five-man ground search this morning but low clouds and heavy
rains hampered the expedition.
   Sarooqi said the group was on standby in the northern mountain
village of Gilgit waiting for the weather to clear. Helicopters plan
to drop them on a glacier 16,000 feet up the mountain.
   Military and civilian aircraft have been flying over the area's
peaks and valleys since the twin-engine Fokker 27 Friendship
disappeared on a flight from Gilgit to Islamabad, 175 miles to the
south.
   The 27-year-old propeller plane was carrying 49 passengers,
including two American nationals and five crew members.
   The pilot made a routine radio contact seven minutes into the
45-minute flight to the Pakistani capital. That was the last
contact, Sarooqi said.
   Sarooqi said no signals have been picked up from the plane. It
was equipped with an emergency locater transmitter that had to be
activitated manually, he said.
   Four aircraft _ a Fokker 27, a DC-3 and two military C-130s _
have crashed in the area since 1963.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail gasoline prices plunged 2{ cents
nationwide in the past two weeks because of fierce competition among
service stations, according to a business analyst.
   The average price for all types of gasoline sold at full- and
self-service pumps was 110.44 cents per gallon for the period ending
Friday, said Trilby Lundberg, who directs the Lundberg Survey of
12,000 stations.
   It was uncertain whether the prices would stay down through the
Labor Day weekend, said Ms. Lundberg.
   Many station operators have lost money as retail prices fell more
sharply than wholesale prices, creating ``a tough situation for
retailers'' and making price predictions difficult, she said.
   The average price of 110.44 cents is about the same price as
April 7, after the initial 10 percent jump in gasoline prices in the
wake of the Alaskan oil spill.
   Since then, prices have climbed up another 8 cents per gallon and
dropped back down again.
   During the recent two-week period, the average price of a gallon
of gasoline at a self-service pump plunged from 102.29 cents to
99.42 cents for regular unleaded, from 118.32 cents to 116.03 cents
for premium unleaded and from 102.63 cents to 98.91 cents for
regular leaded.
   At the full-service pumps, the average price of a gallon of
regular unleaded gasoline fell from 129.55 cents to 128.19 cents,
premium unleaded dropped from 141.74 cents to 140.47, and regular
leaded came down from 129.25 cents to 127.76 cents.

<HEAD>Two Palestinians Die in Troop Clashes; Collaborator Reported Killed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two Palestinians died today of gunshot wounds
suffered in clashes with Israeli forces and West Bank Arabs began a
general strike to protest the deportations of five activists a day
earlier.
   The deaths raised to 12 the number of Palestinians killed in
clashes the past week, in contrast to 10 people who died in
confrontations in the previous three weeks.
   Also today, 60-year-old Rajeb Al Kassas died of injuries suffered
three days earlier when he was beaten by masked youths who accused
him of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab reports said.
The army said it was checking the report.
   The army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, has blamed the
rising violence on a decision by Yasser Arafat's mainstream PLO
faction Fatah early this month urging armed struggle against Israel.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz said, however, that the upturn in
violence also resulted from a new army policy of raiding remote
villages in the West Bank to arrest uprising activists.
   A total of 98 Palestinians have been reported slain by fellow
Arabs as alleged collaborators during the revolt.
   One of the deaths today came after masked youths blocked a main
road the night before in Beit Safafa, a village within Jerusalem,
and pelted police with stones, said police spokesman Uzi Sandori.
   Police first fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the
protesters but then opened fire with live ammunition, wounding a
21-year-old demonstrator who later died, Sandori added.
   Officials at Mukassed Hospital identified the youth as Bassel
Khaled Suleiman and said he died of two gunshot wounds in the chest.
   The second fatality was Ali Mahmoud Shaban, 20, of the Jebaliya
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip, who died of wounds suffered
Friday, the army said.
   The army said Shaban was masked with an Arab scarf when he was
shot while interfering with army operations. The Jerusalem Post
daily said the youth was going from door to door collecting
Israel-issued identity cards.
   The latest fatalities increased the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis during the 20-month-old uprising to 552. Thirty-eight
Israelis also have been slain.
   The general strike called by masked activists in Nablus and the
towns of Ramallah and El-Bireh was to protest Sunday's deportations
of five Palestinians accused of being ringleaders of the uprising.
   Since the rebellion began on Dec. 8, 1987, a total of 60
Palestinians have been expelled, most of them to Lebanon.
   In Jerusalem, Jewish settlement leader Rabbi Moshe Levinger
pleaded innocent today to charges of manslaughter for allegedly
shooting and killing a Palestinian shopkeeper in the West Bank city
of Hebron last September 30.
   Levinger, at the opening of his trial, admitted firing several
shots in the air, claiming it was in self-defense against a stoning
attack on his car.

<HEAD>British Daily Hits at Cardinal over Auschwitz Convent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mass circulation British newspaper today accused
Poland's Roman Catholic Church leader of anti-Semitism in the
controversy about a convent at Auschwitz death camp.
   The Daily Mirror said Cardinal Jozef Glemp's stand must have had
the backing of Pope John Paul II.
   ``The cardinal has tapped into the deep vein of anti-Semitism
which has existed in his country for a thousand years. He would not
have done so without the knowledge of the pope, himself a Pole,''
today's editorial said.
   The tabloid sells 3 million copies a day and supports the
socialist opposition Labor Party.
   On Saturday, Glemp urged Jews worldwide to stop being anti-Polish
in objecting to the existence of a Catholic convent at Auschwitz,
the German concentration camp established in Poland mainly to
exterminate Jews.
   ``If there would be no `anti-Polonism,' there will be no
anti-Semitism in our country,'' Glemp said.
   The Daily Mirror commented: ``The butchers were German Nazis and
their renegade allies, but when Cardinal Glemp spoke warmly of the
improving relations with Poland's old enemies, Germany and Russia,
he used dangerously inflammatory language against the Jews.
   ``He tried to justify his own shameless bad faith in tearing up a
solemn agreement that a Carmelite convent would be removed from
Auschwitz, a place which the Holocaust made holy to Jews.
   ``The Polish Catholic Church had given its word that the nuns
would be moved by last February. Cardinal Glemp broke it without a
qualm. And now that the Jews insist that he keeps the promise, he
accuses them of violating Poland's sovereignty.
   ``In the name of God, what does he hope to gain by fanning the
embers of hate?'' the editorial asked.

<HEAD>Postage to Cost 28 to 32 Cents in 1991, Postmaster General Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The cost of a first-class postage stamp will
likely rise to 28 to 32 cents early in 1991, Postmaster General
Anthony Frank said today.
   That means two more Christmases at the current 25-cent rate for
first-class letters, Frank said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
   Frank had said previously that the Postal Service would apply for
a rate increase sometime next year, to take effect in 1991, but had
not specified the amount.
   He said today that the increase would be 20 to 25 percent, later
specifying a range of 28 cents to 32 cents for the new rate.
   The cost of mailing a letter rose from 22 cents to 25 cents in
the spring of 1988 and a new increase effective in 1991 would
continue the recent policy of increases every three years.
   Any increase must be approved by the independent Postal Rate
Commission in a complex process that takes as long as 11 months.
Thus, to become effective in 1991 the new rates would have to be
applied for next year.
   Under the law that established the Postal Service, the agency is
required to break even financially over the course of a few years.
Thus, it usually reports profits in the year or so after raising
rates, slips into the red as costs rise, then seeks another increase
to get even again.
   The Postal Service is not subsidized by taxpayer funds.

<HEAD>Military Announces Arrest in Killing of U.S. Colonel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAVAO CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops arrested a communist rebel
who admitted taking part in the April slaying of a U.S. Army colonel
in a Manila suburb, the military announced today.
   Juanito Itaas, 25, was arrested with a companion in a public jeep
here Sunday evening after intelligence reports linked him to the
April 21 slaying of Col. James Rowe, the military said.
   Rowe, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who escaped after five
years in a Vietcong prison camp, was slain on his way to work at the
Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in Quezon City.
   Communist rebels claimed responsibility for the assassination.
Maj. Gen. Ramon Montanao, acting military chief of staff, said he
considered the Rowe case solved.
   It was the first time the military has claimed to have arrested
one of the assassins. Last June, police arrested a messenger for a
university newspaper in connection with the slaying but said later
he was not believed to have been among the actual assailants.
   During an interrogation in front of reporters, Itaas said he was
part of a seven-man rebel team that ambushed Rowe a few blocks from
his office.
   Itaas said he was ordered by rebel leaders to travel from Davao
City to Manila to attend a meeting on organizational problems. After
arriving, Itaas said he was ordered to take part in an assassination
but did not know the intended target.
   Itaas said he was among four assailants in one of two cars which
took part in the attack. Three other assailants were in a backup
vehicle, he added.
   Military officials claimed Itaas also admitted taking part in
three other assassinations of police and military officers in the
Davao City area. His companion, Angelito Moralla, 23, was held as a
suspected member of the rebel logistic command.
   Officials said Itaas would be flown to Manila, where he would be
charged with murder.
   Rowe, 51, of McAllen, Texas, was assigned to a unit which
provides training and logistical support to the Philippine armed
forces. Rebels claim the organization also assists the military
clandestinely in its counter-insurgency operations.
   Rowe was the most senior U.S. official to be slain by communist
rebels during their 20-year insurgency. In October 1987, rebels
killed three Americans, including two Air Force enlisted men, and a
Filipino civilian in attacks outside Clark Air Base, 50 miles north
of Manila.

<HEAD>Safety Regulations for Minivans Being Strengthened</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS agency name to Traffic sted Transportation in 4th graf,

<TEXT>
   Auto safety advocates say it's no longer a
question of whether minivans and light trucks will have to pass the
same safety regulations as passenger cars _ but when.
   ``You look at auto safety in general and the issue of minivans
stands out like a sore thumb,'' said Clarence Ditlow, director of
the Center for Auto Safety, the non-profit agency founded by
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   Ditlow says there has been enough public outcry and statistical
information that the government can no longer ignore the regulation
discrepancy between passenger cars and minivans.
   Jeffrey Miller, acting administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, agrees that regulations will be
implemented within the next few years. But he says the reason is
mostly to reassure the public, not because minivans are less safe.
   ``It's very important for motorists to understand that most
safety standards already apply,'' said Miller. ``We are trying to
build on what already is a pretty good safety record. It helps to
reassure the public.''
   Statistics from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety show
that the accident death rate per 10,000 vans last year was 1.4, an
increase over the year before but only slightly higher than the 1.3
rate of large cars and much lower than the 3.0 rate of small cars.
   Minivans, along with light trucks and off-road vehicles, are
classified as multipurpose passenger vehicles _ a category that
doesn't have the same restrictions as passenger cars. Minivans are
manufactured by Chrysler, General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen,
Nissan, Mitsubishi and Mazda.
   Minivans are fast usurping the market for station wagons among
large families, and those people worry about the lack of government
regulation for side and roof strength, shoulder-lap seat belts and
head restraints.
   But Albert Slechter, federal government affairs director for
Chrysler Corp., which has 56 percent of the U.S. minivan market,
says some of the safety measures required of cars don't make sense
for vans.
   For years, the Center for Auto Safety and others have tried
unsuccessfully to extend government auto safety rules to minivans
and light trucks.
   Last session, the Senate passed a bill requiring such rules, but
the legislation died after 18 months with no action in the House
committee chaired by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., whose district
includes Detroit and whose wife works for General Motors Corp. A
similar bill passed by the Senate before the current recess may be
headed back to the same committee.
   Ditlow said the bill may face trouble again in the House, but
added, ``There is such a growing consensus that minivans are less
safe... The bottom line is not whether (the safety rules will be
strengthened), but when.''
   In a June 29 letter to members of the Senate, Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner said the department was moving to improve
safety of light trucks and vans and didn't think congressional
action was necessary.
   Miller said some regulations, like those concerning front-seat
head restraints, will be finalized this year to apply to the 1991
model year.
   A chief concern is rollover, which is related to the higher
center of gravity on vans and utility vehicles. Miller said the
vehicle's roof and seat belts protect occupants when a car rolls,
and minivan manufacturers have voluntarily made those features as
sturdy as on passenger cars.
   According to statistics, the greatest rollover problem is not
vans but light trucks and off-road vehicles, partly because of the
type of driver attracted to those vehicles, Miller said.
   There are specific passenger cars regulations to protect against
crashes into the side, but none exist for vans. This isn't a
problem, van makers say, because the van is higher and the point of
impact by another vehicle is into the sill which is a sturdy beam
across the side.
   As for the raised rear stop light now required in cars,
manufacturers say they can't figure out where it should go on a van
and say vans' tail lights already are higher than those on cars.

<HEAD>Walesa Says He Will Appeal for Strike Moratorium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today he
plans to appeal to workers for at least a six-month strike
moratorium to give the new government some time to solve Poland's
pressing problems.
   The independent Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said Walesa would issue
a statement in the next few days to affirm the need for a moratorium
of at least six months.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity activist and a
close adviser to Walesa, was approved by parliament Thursday as the
East bloc's first non-Communist leader.
   Asked by reporters in Gdansk today when the moratorium request
would be issued, Walesa replied, ``We should do it together with the
appointment of the government.''
   ``We have the biggest chance ever to make the Poland of our
dreams. We can go in this direction, but we cannot do it if we are
going to suffer economic losses,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki has been holding talks with other political leaders to
decide how to allot government ministries among Solidarity, the
Communist Party and two smaller parties that joined Solidarity to
form a majority coalition in parliament.
   Walesa has said in the past that an end to labor unrest and
Western aid are necessary to help reverse Poland's economic decline
and provide a favorable climate for the new government.
   The Gazeta Wyborcza article said Walesa told workers with pay
demands that Solidarity would help negotiate their demands with
management.
   Pay disputes have broken out on an almost daily basis over the
past six months, but most stoppages have been brief.
   Workers are frustrated by annual inflation of more than 100
percent, price increases, and empty shelves. They are also upset
about the lack of visible economic improvement since Solidarity was
legalized in April after a seven-year ban and Poland's freest
elections in more than four decades were held in June.
   Railway workers in the central city of Lodz ended a one-day
strike on Saturday under pressure from Walesa. They sent an appeal
to Mazowiecki asking him to satisfy their pay demands.

<HEAD>Police Re-occupy Island After Riot By Vietnamese Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today re-occupied an outlying island
after a riot by Vietnamese boat people during which 23 policemen
were injured, police reported.
   About 250 officers landed without incident by helicopter and by
boat on Tai A Chau island, where about 5,000 Vietnamese boat people
are housed, a police statement said. Police searched the island for
any hidden weapons.
   About 50 policemen withdrew from the island to nearby police
launches Sunday night after some 1,000 Vietnamese began hurling
stones following a dispute over the distribution of rice. None of
the policemen was seriously injured.
   Police said some of the Vietnamese were armed with metal bars and
other sharpened objects.
   Forty rounds of tear gas were fired by police during the
violence, police said. It was the first time tear gas had been used
to stop unrest among Vietnamese who fled here seeking a better life.
   The Vietnamese boat people have been put on the island until they
can be inoculated and processed into detention centers to await
screening.
   Under a policy adopted in June 1988, Vietnamese boat people will
be granted refugee status and resettled overseas only if they can
prove they fled political persecution in Vietnam. Otherwise, they
would be considered illegal immigrants and face repatriation.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese are staying in Hong Kong. Two-thirds of
them are kept in prison-like centers, waiting to be screened.
   Earlier this month, Vietnamese battled each other with iron bars,
stones and sharpened objects at the Whitehead Detention Center.
Seventeen people were injured.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Calls For Recall of `Dangerous' Cribs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group founded to promote baby crib safety
said it is asking the Consumer Product Safety Commission today to
recall millions of cribs because protruding corner posts can snag a
child's clothing and cause strangulation.
   The Danny Foundation, named for a California boy who became
brain-damaged after his shirt got caught on a crib post, is seeking
a ban on protruding corner posts or knobs on cribs.
   ``It is time for the government and crib manufacturers to
acknowledge these dangerous cribs and prevent further deaths and
injuries,'' said Jack Walsh, executive director of the foundation.
   Nearly 50 children have died and two have been left permanently
brain damaged since 1973 as a result of getting caught on crib
posts, the foundation's petition said.
   The current voluntary safety standard for cribs adopted in 1984,
which allows corner posts to protrude five-eighths of an inch,
doesn't protect against strangulation because that is still long
enough to catch an infant's clothing, necklace or pacifier cord, the
foundation said in a statement. It said a recent study of children
climbing out of cribs found that two became caught on cornerposts
that complied with the standard.
   ``Believe it or not, when this standard was adopted, consumers in
the group opted for the five-eighths-inch standard because it
allowed for a less expensive crib _ almost $16 at the retail level
on a price of $110 for a crib,'' Aaron Locker, general counsel of
the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, said today on ABC's
``Good Morning America.''
   But Walsh said, ``It is clear that the voluntary standard is
inadequate. Cribs that comply with the curent standard are as
hazardous as the millions of cribs manufactured before the
standard.''
   The foundation, in addition to urging a recall of ``unsafe
cribs'' and a ban on protruding cornerposts, asked the safety
commission to mount an information campaign to warn consumers of the
dangers of the cribs.
   ``There are up to 25 million hand-me-down cribs in this country
alone'' which continue to present a danger, Walsh said.
   The Danny Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to
promoting crib safety, was founded by the family of Danny
Lineweaver, a child who became severely brain damaged in July 1984,
just short of his second birthday, when his shirt got caught on a
post as he was climbing out of his crib. The child remains comatose.

   A retired Israeli officer was questioned by
police today about allegations he trained private militias for
Colombian drug lords, and claimed he did no more than other former
Israeli officers working in the region.
   Retired Lt. Col. Yair Klein told reporters at police headquarters
in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva he believed he was innocent of
any wrongdoing.
   ``If I did break the law, a lot of other people did,'' he said.
   Israeli newspapers have said Klein was the officer seen in an NBC
film showing the training of death squads for the Medellin drug
cartel in Colombia. He has denied he trained squads for Colombian
drug dealers.
   On Sunday, Klein said he would name high-ranking officers,
including one now sitting in Israel's Parliament, who were involved
in training operations in Latin America. But today he continued to
refuse to make any names public.
   Police launched an inquiry Sunday into possible involvement of
Israelis with Colombian assassination squads.
   Yehoshua Caspi, head of the investigations unit, said police
would examine ``all aspects of Israelis suspected of selling
military services and know-how without Defense Ministry permission
to unofficial groups in Colombia.'' He said the Defense Ministry
requested the probe.
   The possible involvement of Klein and other Israelis with the
Medellin drug cartel drew a renewed defense today from Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``I know our officers. I cannot believe that they have been
involved in such crimes,'' Shamir said.
   He said the government was not responsible for its citizens'
actions overseas but that it would prosecute those who broke laws.
``We have to do what we can. ... I am concerned with everything that
is doing harm to our image,'' he said.
   Reports from Colombia said four Israelis were involved in
training assassins for drug smugglers in Colombia along with U.S.,
British and South African mercenaries.
   Klein returned to Israel from Miami on Friday after Israeli
newspapers and television identified him in the NBC film on drug
cartel militias.
   He said that last year he helped train banana growers and
ranchers in Colombia's rural countryside to fight guerrillas.
   He said he was paid $40,000 for two monthlong weapons training
courses he conducted with three other retired Israeli officers and
said all of his dealings in Colombia ``were according to the law.''
   He said his security company, Spearhead, ended its training
program last year and his last visit to Colombia was four months ago.
   His company was denied a Defense Ministry permit to export
weapons or arms technology, but he said the permit was unnecessary
because ``you don't need a permit to work with civilian
organizations.''
   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Klein was paid $800,000 to train
hit squads for the Medellin drug cartel. The newspaper alleged that
Klein was recruited last year by cartel leaders to train ranchers
and paramilitary troops.
   Yediot said Klein was introduced to the drug barons by an Israeli
businessman, identified only as ``Shoshani.''
   Klein confirmed that a man named Shoshani helped him make
contacts and received 10 percent of his fees.
   Yediot said Colombia's secret service sent a report to Israel
four months ago on Israeli mercenaries in Colombia, but the claims
were ignored.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Israel received no official
report from Colombia, but began investigating allegations in the
Colombian press passed along by the Israeli Embassy in April.

   South African leader F.W. de Klerk
today outlined a plan for resolving his country's racial conflict to
President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, who praised some of de Klerk's
ideas.
   The trip has been viewed as a major step toward improving South
Africa's relations with its black neighbors. Kaunda has been one of
the harshest critics of South Africa's white-led government for the
past 25 years.
   De Klerk and Kaunda covered a range of regional issues during two
hours of talks at a hotel in Livingstone, a tourist town in southern
Zambia near Victoria Falls.
   ``I had the opportunity to give a positive vision of the future
in which South Africa is going to break out of the cycle of
conflict,'' De Klerk said at a brief news conference after the
talks. ``We are going through with negotiations and dialogue.''
   Asked about de Klerk's ideas, Kaunda said: ``There are certain
democratic principles which he says he intends to implement. About
those, I see no disagreement at all.''
   Both leaders declined to be more specific.
   Kaunda led a Zambian delegation of about 100 in greeting de
Klerk, South Africa's acting president, at the airport today.
   In their talks, De Klerk and Kaunda also discussed the crumbling
effort to end Angola's 14-year civil war and the independence
process in Namibia, the territory South Africa has ruled for 74
years.
   On Namibia, de Klerk said he and Kaunda agreed that the year-long
independence plan was on track with elections scheduled for early
November.
   De Klerk met Sunday in Johannesburg with Angolan guerrilla leader
Jonas Savimbi, who softened his stance a week after canceling a
cease-fire with Angola's Marxist government.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, was forced to resign from the
presidency Aug. 14 after the Cabinet overrode his objections to the
talks with Kaunda.
   Botha said Zambia should be shunned because it allows the African
National Congress guerrilla movement to maintain its headquarters in
Lusaka, the capital. The ANC wages a bombing and sabotage campaign
in its bid to undermine the South African government.
   De Klerk, leader of the governing National Party, is favored to
win a five-year term as president after parliamentary elections
Sept. 6.
   He has tried to portray himself as a statesman capable of ending
South Africa's international isolation while at the same insisting
the ANC renounce violence before being included in negotiations.
   Kaunda has led Zamibia since its independence from Britain in
1964 and currently is chairman of the Frontline States, a six-nation
group formed to work collectively against the South African
government.
   After talks Sunday with de Klerk, Savimbi said his U.S.-backed
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, still is
committed to peace in Angola and promised he will attend an African
summit in Zaire next month to put the fractured peace process back
on track.
   ``We welcome the prospect of resuming talks with the (Angolan
government) at the earliest possible opportunity. (We) commit
ourselves again to the effort to achieve peace and national
reconciliation,'' Savimbi said.
   The statement did not say the guerrillas will observe the June 22
cease-fire agreement.
   On Thursday, Savimbi said a 2-month-old cease-fire had failed and
ordered his fighters to resume fighting. Angola's government and the
guerrillas repeatedly have accused each other of violating the
cease-fire and reported heavy fighting recently.
   The rebels have been at war for a share in government since
Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975.
   On Friday, de Klerk met in Zaire with President Mobutu Sese Seko
and the two agreed to mediate between the warring Angolans.
   South Africa supported Savimbi until a regional peace treaty in
December with Angola, which also calls for a phased withdrawal of
Cuba's 50,000 soldiers from Angola.
   Washington supplies the guerrillas with about $15 million in
annual aid.

   An estranged husband showed up uninvited at a
birthday party and opened fire on guests, killing four and injuring
two.
   ``It was a family birthday party that turned into tragedy,''
sheriff's Deputy Dean Scoville said today.
   The alleged gunman, identified as Raymundo Navarro Jr., 26, fled
the scene, but surrendered to deputies early today. He was arrested
for investigation of murder, Scoville said.
   Three people died at the home in East Los Angeles following the
shooting late Sunday night. A fourth died early today at Santa Marta
Hospital and two other victims were taken to County-USC Medical
Center.
   The identities of the victims and the conditions of the survivors
were not immediately available. Authorities declined to say whether
Navarro's wife was among those shot.
   The two were planning to be divorced, according to Deputy Fidel
Gonzales. ``We believe that's where the motive lies,'' he said.
   The incident was part of weekend violence in Los Angeles that
took the lives of 16, police said.

   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank says he would not stand in
the way of a congressional investigation into his relationship with
a male prostitute.
   ``If people think an inquest is appropriate, I have no objection
to that at all,'' Frank said Sunday after attending a parade in Fall
River.
   Democrats and Republicans may request a formal investigation when
Congress reconvenes early next month. The House code of conduct
calls for members to act ``at all times in a manner which shall
reflect creditably on the House.''
   Frank says he was ``victimized'' in his relationship with a male
prostitute who may have run a sex ring out of his apartment, and
predicted voters will not hold the incident against him.
   Despite Republican calls for his resignation, polls published
over the weekend showed Frank's constituents still strongly support
him.
   One poll found Frank's constituents by a 2-1 margin said he
deserved re-election, and more than 65 percent in another poll did
not think Frank should resign.
   Frank received spirited support Sunday as he marched in the Fall
River parade, three days after admitting to the relationship with a
male prostitute.
   The parade was part of an event named ``Fall River Celebrates
America'' that drew some 100,000 people over the weekend.
   While there were a few muffled boos, most of the crowd cheered
Frank as the Democratic congressman moved through the parade route.
   Frank, 49, acknowledged on Friday he had once paid for sex with a
male prostitute, then hired the man, Steve Gobie, to do household
chores and run errands.
   Frank said he fired Gobie when he became suspicious that the man
was selling sex from Frank's Capitol Hill apartment.
   ``I don't think I'm going to be heavily penalized by the voters
for being suckered by a guy I was trying to help,'' Frank said on
Friday.
   In a related development, Gobie said he helped police in
Alexandria, Va. on Friday arrest a former Senate aide who allegedly
tried to arrange a sexual encounter with a 13-year-old girl.
Alexandria police Cpl. John Avery confirmed Gobie's claim today.
   The Washington Times and the Washington Post reported today that
the man was charged with solicitation to commit indecent liberties
involving a minor.
   Gobie told both newspapers no actual child was ever involved.
``It was something we made up,'' he told The Times.
   The Times identified the man as John E. Ashford, 39, who has done
consulting work for several Democratic governors and Sen. Richard H.
Bryan, D-Nev. He is a former aide to Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo.
   Ashford declined comment. His attorney, Rawles Jones, said
Ashford would plead innocent.
   After publicly acknowledging his homosexuality in May 1987, Frank
won election to his fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote
in the state's 4th District, which encompasses some Boston suburbs
and parts of southeastern Massachusetts.
   A poll of 400 registered voters in Frank's district conducted
Friday night for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV showed 65.3 percent did
not think Frank should resign.
   The Boston Herald and WCVB-TV polled 300 of Frank's constituents,
who by nearly a 2-1 margin said Frank deserved re-election.
   Both polls carry a margin of error of plus-or-minus 5 percent.

<HEAD>Final Session Opens to Pursue Elusive Cambodian Peace</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The final session of an international peace
conference on Cambodia opened today in the French capital with no
agreement as yet on any of the major issues dividing the
Vietnam-backed Cambodian government from three resistance factions.
   Foreign ministers attending the opening sessions of the monthlong
conference established working committees on reaching cease-fire,
achieving a power-sharing agreement, repatriating refugees and
monitoring the complete withdrawal of 26,000 Vietnamese troops by
Sept. 27.
   But nearly three weeks of committee meetings, which has involved
19 countries and the United Nations, yielded so little progress that
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker announced Friday he would not
return to Paris for the meeting today through Wednesday.
   The United States accused Vietnam and its government in Phnom
Penh, led by Prime Minister Hun Sen, of inflexibility toward the
conditions for peace set out by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of
the resistance, who enjoys strong U.S. support.
   China's official Xinhua news agency reported over the weekend
that Foreign Minister Qian Qichen would attend the closing
ministerial session only ``if the four committees of the conference
can succeed in producing agreements.''
   China sponsors the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three
resistance movements fighting the Cambodian government. The Khmer
Rouge, whose genocidal rule between 1975 and 1978 cost a million
lives, have been at the center of the deadlock.
   Sihanouk's resistence coalition has insisted that the Khmer Rouge
be given a role in a transitional government that would rule between
the troop pullout and elections, which Hun Sen has said he would
like to hold within three months of the withdrawal.
   But Hun Sen rejects including the Khmer Rouge and says they must
be ``eliminated'' politically and militarily.
   ``The Khmer Rouge remain the principle obstacle. They don't
believe in a political solution,'' said Hun Sen's deputy foreign
minister, Sok An.
   The Khmer Rouge are militarily the strongest of the resistence
factions and are the most feared by the government and Cambodian
population.
   Surprise last-minute concessions were possible, but not likely.
   Thailand, which has thousands of Cambodian refugees in camps
along its border and is the supply route from China to the Khmer
Rouge, has predicted no ``global'' accord will be signed and that
another international meeting will be necessary.
   Indian officials have said the problems existing after nearly two
decades of fighting ``cannot be settled in one month.''
   There remained hope among some delegates that the conference
could result in a partial accord.
   ``It does not appear likely the conference will achieve its
objectives,'' said a Western delegate several days before the
conference reconvened.
   But, the delegate added, the conference is less a failure than
``a stage through which one has to pass.''

<TEXT>
   The largest blood center in the country was down
to less than a day's supply when a planned four-day strike by more
than 400 union workers began today, a spokesman said.
   The New York Blood Center, which handles 2,000 pints per day, or
nearly all of the blood that the area's 250 hospitals use, planned
to resupply from outside the area.
   Hospital and union officials said most hospitals have put off
elective surgery.
   Sixty-five of the affected hospitals are in central and northern
New Jersey and are supplied by New Jersey Blood Services of New
Brunswick, a branch of the New York Blood Center, said spokesman
Michael Scahill.
   ``We're trying to source as much blood as we can from different
parts of the country. Any Red Cross center that has blood has been
contacted,'' Scahill said.
   A picket line was established by the 50 to 75 employees at the
New Brunswick center, according to Scahill. Pickets also marched
outside the New York Blood Center in Manhattan.
   ``Everybody is out and we are accusing management of allowing no
negotiations over the weekend, absolutely none,'' said Edward Kay,
an executive vice president for Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and
Health Care Employees Union.
   No negotiations were planned until workers are back at their
jobs, Scahill said.
   Besides calling around the country to locate blood, medically
qualified management employees were taking blood from donors,
according to Scahill. Those without medical training were doing
clerical work.
   The not-for-profit organization usually has a four-to-five-day
supply of blood, but because of the strike and the time of year, it
was down to less than a day's worth, Scahill said.
   ``It's the traditional shortage period, the pre-Labor Day period.
... We're used to shortfalls in the system, but this adds a real
crunch to it,'' he said.
   The union said the strike was called because of a management
attempt to cut pension contributions by 50 percent.
   The labor union announced last week that it would walk out on the
blood center today for four days and offered to set up weekend talks
to avert the job action, according to Kay.

<HEAD>Extremists Threaten Pope If He Visits Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An underground extremist faction today
threatened to kill Pope John Paul II if he comes to Lebanon on a
peace mission.
   The wording of the threat by the Organization for the Defense of
the Oppressed suggested it was made by Shiite Moslem zealots.
   A newspaper in Iran, a sponsor of Moslem Shiite extremism in
Lebanon, said Sunday the pope should stay out of Lebanon, but it did
not make an overt threat.
   It was the second time in four days that the previously unknown
Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed has made a statement.
   Delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut, the statement said:
``To his holiness Pope John Paul II: We address our words to him,
wishing that he writes his will before he comes to Beirut.''
   ``The organization emphasizes that his holiness the Pope will be
one of the victims of the criminal war our beloved homeland Lebanon
is living through,'' the statement said.
   Other Moslem groups have said that a Lebanese peace mission by
the Roman Catholic leader would really be intended to boost the
Christian side in the country's 14-year-old civil war.
   However, a senior Shiite cleric, Sheik Mohammed Hussein
Fadlallah, was quoted Sunday as saying he would welcome the pope and
``give him full security guarantees'' to visit Moslem west Beirut.
   The Vatican said it is studying the possibility of a visit to
Lebanon, but no date has been set.
   In its statement, the extremist group also said ``it will arrange
a reception for the Pope of Rome similar to our reception of the
Israeli invaders and the forces of (former President) Reagan and the
`loving mother' (France) in 1982 and 1983.''
   That last paragraph referred to twin suicide truck bombings on
Oct. 23, 1983 that killed 241 American servicemen and 58 Frenchmen.
The attacks prompted withdrawal of an international peacekeeping
force from Lebanon.
   France, which ruled Lebanon from 1918 to 1943, often is referred
to as the the Christians' ``loving mother,'' mainly because it
helped forge a national covenant that gave the Christians key
government posts.
   The French have now sent a six-ship flotilla to the Eastern
Mediterranean off Lebanon, saying the forces may be needed to
evacuate French nationals from Lebanon.
   Last week, the Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed
issued a statement threatening to attack any French vessel that
approaches the Lebanese coast.
   Today's developments came amid renewed clashes between Christian
army units and Syrian troops allied with Moslem militias. Police
reported no casualties in the sporadic clashes.
   By police count, 792 have been killed and 2,247 wounded in the
5-month-old confrontation, the latest round of the civil war.
   On the diplomatic front, a French envoy was reported in Damascus,
Syria, waiting to begin talks on a French peace plan, while a Soviet
envoy discussed peace proposals for Lebanon with Iraqi officials.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said the envoy would be
pressing for a cease-fire with an embargo on arms deliveries to the
warring factions, political reform, and withdrawal of Syrian and
Israeli forces from Lebanon.
   The proposed troop withdrawal is similar to a Soviet proposal
outlined Sunday by Arab diplomats.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon with an estimated
40,000 troops in the country under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate. Israel has maintained a self-declared security zone in
south Lebanon since withdrawing most of its invasion forces in 1985.
   Moslem radio stations today criticized the French proposal. The
Voice of the Nation, the most popular station in Moslem west Beirut,
said: ``Dumas' plan ... lays all the blame for the crisis on Syria,
with whom most of the Moslem majority is aligned.''

   A small airplane carrying USAir employees
crashed in patchy fog early today near the Lynchburg Municipal
Airport, killing all five people aboard, state police said.
   The Piper-31 aircraft was coming in for a landing when it went
down at about 12:50 a.m., according to W.R. Stafford, a state police
dispatcher in Appomattox.
   USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said the airline had chartered the
Bayland Aviation plane in Salisbury, Md. Those aboard included a
pilot and co-pilot and three USAir-Henson Aviation mechanics who
were going to Lynchburg to work on a passenger jet that was having
mechanical problems.
   State police withheld the identities of the victims until
relatives were notified.
   The National Weather Service said there were patches of dense fog
in the area at the time, but it was unclear whether the fog
contributed to the crash.
   ``The plane was trying to attempt a visual approach and broke off
the approach,'' said Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Washington. ``They then requested an
instrument landing system approach to the airport.''
   The plane missed the runway by a quarter mile and sheared through
some trees in a wooded area before crashing in a corn field,
according to Cmdr. S.K. Newby of the Lynchburg Police Department.
The crash left no survivors.
   ``It was torn all to pieces,'' he said.
   Officials at the airport declined to comment on the crash, but
said the Federal Aviation Administration was handling the
investigation.

   A small twin-engine plane carrying European
tourists crashed in a southeastern game park, killing all six
passengers and their Kenyan pilot, authorities said today.
   The 10-seat Cessna 404, which took off from the coastal city of
Mombasa, crashed Sunday morning in Tsavo West National Park en route
to the neighboring Amboseli Game Park, said Martin Knus, manager of
Private Safaris Ltd., which organized the flight.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known.
   Knus said the investigation would look into whether weather
played a part in the accident. Forecasters said weather in the area
was overcast but dry at the time of the accident.
   The names of the victims were not immediately available. Knus
tentatively gave the nationalities of the tourists as four Swiss and
two Austrians.
   Neither the Swiss nor the Austrian embassies had any information
on the crash.
   It came at a time when Kenya is trying to reassure visitors of
the safety of its parks. Since July, gunmen in remote regions have
attacked and killed one American tourist, a French couple and
conservationist George Adamson.

   Two young Hungarians arrested in
anti-government protests last week will go on trial Tuesday on
charges of disrupting public order, a judge said today.
   Prague riot police dispersed thousands of demonstrators Aug. 21,
the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
attempts to liberalize Communism in Czechoslovakia.
   State news media said 370 people were detained in last week's

   The two Hungarians, who belong to the FIDESZ independent
Hungarian youth group, have been identified as Gyoergy Kerenyi and
Tamas Deutsch.
   Plainclothes police seized the two activists as they took part in
a protest, and charges of violating public order were pressed by a
Prague prosecutor Saturday.
   Prague District Judge Jan Belohlavek said they will go on trial
in District Court on Tuesday. They face up to six months in jail or
a fine of $2,000.
   Hungary has protested the holding of the two Hungarians and said
it would guarantee their appearance in court if they are set free.
   Relations between Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which are Warsaw
Pact allies, worsened after Hungarian television carried recent
interviews with Alexander Dubcek, who led the 1968 Czechoslovak
reforms, and with dissident Vaclav Havel.

   Fifty years after World War II erupted, half of
all Americans believe global war will consume the world again one
day, a Media General-Associated Press poll has found.
   A majority of those who expect another world war believe it will
happen within two decades, the survey found. And if it does recur,
most Americans fear it will escalate into an all-out nuclear
conflagration.
   A majority of respondents to the poll also said one of World War
II's darkest episodes could recur: A holocaust on the order of Nazi
Germany's murder of more than 6 million Jews.
   The 1,163 respondents were asked: ``Do you think that kind of
thing could happen again _ that is, the killing of millions of
people because of their religion or ethnic background?'' Six in 10
said it could.
   More than a million German soldiers invaded Poland on Sept. 1,
1939, prodding France and Britain to declare war on Germany a few
days later. World War II lasted until 1945, claiming the lives of an
estimated 50 million people.
   The United States joined the war in 1941 after the Japanese
attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four years
later, the U.S. hastened Japan's surrender by dropping atomic bombs
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ still the only time nuclear weapons have
been used in war.
   Six in 10 poll respondents said the Hiroshima bombing, in which
up to 200,000 people died, was right. Seventy percent of the men in
the survey supported the bombing; half the women agreed.
   Two in 10 respondents said they sometimes think of Japan as the
enemy because of the war. And with Japan now one of the world's
leading economic powers, nearly four in 10 said the United States
did too much to help rebuild Japan after the war.
   A smaller group, 24 percent, said the United States did too much
to help rebuild West Germany, which also is one of the world's
strongest economies today. One in 10 said they sometimes think of
Germany as the enemy.
   Respondents strongly supported the reunification of Germany,
which was divided after the war into democratic West Germany and
communist-controlled East Germany. Seventy percent favored the two
Germanies' coming together again as one country.
   Overall, nearly 70 percent considered themselves familiar with
the events of World War II. Older people were far more apt to rate
themselves as ``very familiar'' with the war _ 57 percent of those
older than age 64 chose that category, compared with just 12 percent
of those younger than 45.
   Familiarity with one aspect of the war was overwhelming:
Ninety-five percent said they had heard of the Holocaust. Age was
not a factor.
   Respondents in the oldest group were less likely to believe there
will be another world war. But they were more likely to expect that
if one did occur, it would escalate into all-out nuclear war.
   The expectation of another world war was greater among women (53
percent) than among men (44 percent). Women also were more apt than
men to fear nuclear escalation of a world war, 60-48 percent.
   Of the 49 percent who said they expect another world war at some
point, 6 percent said it was likely within five years, 29 percent
within 10 years and 26 percent within 20 years. Thus 61 percent of
this group _ or 30 percent overall _ foresaw World War III within
two decades.
   The poll was conducted by telephone July 7-16 among a random
sample of adults in the continental United States. It has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   Jurors began a third day of deliberations today
in the trial of Leona Helmsley, the ``queen'' of expensive New York
hotels who is charged with evading $1.2 million in taxes.
   The jurors spent 15 hours deliberating over the weekend.
   The jury, which has been sequestered since closing arguments
began Wednesday, deliberated seven hours Sunday and had met more
than eight hours Saturday.
   Two hours into deliberations Sunday, they sent out a note
requesting documents relating to a Helmsley-controlled partnership
that owned three of the Helmsley hotels in Manhattan.
   The partnership, Realesco Equities Corp., is named in two sets of
charges _ aiding in the filing of false corporate tax returns and
mail fraud _ against Mrs. Helmsley and her two co-defendants, former
aides Frank Turco and Joseph Licari.
   Mrs. Helmsley's 80-year-old husband, Harry, also was indicted but
was severed from the trial because he was found to be mentally
incompetent.
   The jury also asked for a 1985 memo which Turco had forwarded to
Licari and on which he had written, ``Please deep six after
reading.''
   The document was a progress report on renovations at the
Helmsleys' Connecticut estate, Dunnellen Hall.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 69, is accused of evading $1.2 million in federal
taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations at
Dunnellen Hall, to her businesses. She is charged with 41 counts in
a 47-count indictment.
   A second note requested rereading of testimony concerning
Licari's involvement in the alleged phony billing scheme, a list of
exhibit numbers and documents dealing with the payments by another
Helmsley company.

   A small plane carrying two people made an
emergency landing on the grounds of a middle school this morning,
but no one was injured, officials said.
   The plane landed at about 8 a.m. on a grassy athletic field
adjacent to the Sharpstown Middle School in southwest Houston, said
Houston Independent School District spokesman Larry Yawn. He said
the engine had failed.
   Today was the first day of work for teachers, but students won't
return to school until next week.
   The vintage plane's pilot and passenger, his wife, were not
injured in the landing, Yawn said. He said the couple had taken off
from the Clear Lake section of Houston, about 20 miles southeast of
the school.
   The area where the plane landed is about the size of a football
field and is used for physical education activities and football
practice.

   A 24-year-old man killed himself this morning
while playing Russian roulette with a handgun, police said.
   The shooting of Brian Maher was the second death in two days
attributed to the deadly game.
   Maher and two friends went out drinking and then returned to his
apartment in Queens, where they played Russian roulette with a
.38-caliber revolver that had one bullet in the chamber, according
to a police spokeswoman, Officer Janice Swinney.
   Maher shot himself in the head at 7:20 a.m. and was pronounced
dead at the scene.
   Early Sunday, an off-duty New York City police officer, Joseph
Montalbano, 21, was allegedly shot to death by his girlfriend, Elisa
Beth Egger, 24, during a game of Russian roulette in his Holbrook,
N.Y., home.
   Ms. Egger told police she didn't realize the revolver was loaded,
Suffolk County police said. She was arrested on a charge of
second-degree manslaughter.

   A burglar died after he apparently
stumbled down a stairway and fell on a hunting arrow he was
carrying, investigators said today.
   Greg Moore, 25, of Tulsa, was found dead in his pickup truck
about three-fourths of a mile from a house in Skiatook that had been
ransacked early Sunday, according to Bill Williams, chief deputy at
the Osage County sheriff's office.
   Williams said a passing oil field worker found Moore slumped in
the pickup, with the lights on and horn blasting. Moore had a wound
in his lower chest that appeared to have severed a major artery,
Williams said.
   The deputy said cocaine, syringes and other drug paraphernalia,
along with goods stolen from the house, were found in the truck.
   Investigators found blood on the porch of the burglarized house
and a bloody hunting arrow and trails of blood inside, Williams said.

<TEXT>
   A group of women who performed as many as 13,000
illegal abortions in the four years preceding the Supreme Court's
legalization of the procedure is considering reviving its
underground organization.
   In the wake of the court's recent decision allowing states to
restrict access to abortions, former members of the group _ called
Jane _ say such an organization may again be necessary.
   Jane, believed to have been the only group of its kind in the
United States, involved about 120 women who were trained by illegal
abortionists and worked clandestinely from 1969 to 1972 under
constant threat of arrest.
   ``It was like being in Vietnam for four years,'' said Jody
Howard, a former Jane member who is now a freelance writer.
   Ms. Howard and Ruth Surgal, another leading Jane member, told a
group of about 60 women gathered in a North Side bookstore last week
that they had been driven by deep conviction, both to help desperate
women and to free women from dependence on male doctors or
abortionists.
   ``It's not that I feel great that we did 11, 12, 13,000
abortions,'' Ms. Howard said. ``But I feel good that we can go to
people and say, `You can do it. We did it before, and we can do it
again.'''
   Members said the group's abortions were safe: about 3 percent
resulted in complications, usually infection, approximately the same
rate as that of doctors. The group says none of the women undergoing
Jane abortions died.
   The group operated in secrecy, using code names and frequently
changing apartments where the abortions were performed, the women
said. Each pregnant woman met with a counselor, sometimes several
times, to discuss the procedure and anything else she wanted.
   Despite the precautions, however, seven group members were
arrested in 1972. The charges were dropped when the Supreme Court
legalized abortion. And for the most part, Jane members said, there
was a tacit agreement with police officers, who sent their wives,
daughters and girlfriends to the group.
   Jane began as an underground abortion referral service. It was
named after a woman who preferred to leave the pseudonym Jane
instead of her real name when calling women about abortions.
   By 1969, Jane members realized that some of the abortionists they
thought were doctors were, in fact, laymen. So the women began
attending abortions to learn the procedure, Ms. Howard said.
   ``We said, `If they could do it, we could, too,''' she said.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed guerrillas said today they
have stepped up attacks on government-held cities in eastern
Afghanistan and closed a section of a key highway that links the
Afghan capital to the Soviet Union.
   The Yunis Khalis rebel force, a Moslem fundamentalist faction,
said its guerrillas killed 60 Afghan troops and captured 60 others
since Thursday in fighting west of Khost, 18 miles from the Pakistan
border.
   A spokesman for another guerrilla faction, the Jamiat-e-Islami,
said guerrilla forces had recently closed a 36-mile section of the
Salang highway north of Kabul.
   The mountainous, 260-mile road is the capital's main overland
link with the Soviet Union.
   Earlier this year, the Communists built an alternate road for
part of the way to divert convoys during guerrilla strikes.
   The Khalis claimed to have captured three military posts, four
tanks, and a large quantity of ammunition.
   ``This is part of a new offensive to capture the Khost area,''
said Shah Mohammad, a Khalis officer at the party's headquarters in
Peshawar, Pakistan.
   Another Khalis spokesman said about 10 guerrillas were killed and
20 were wounded.
   There was no independent confirmation. Official Radio Kabul,
monitored in Islamabad, has daily reported dozens of guerrilla
casualties along the eastern front.
   Both sides usually make conflicting claims.
   The guerrillas, who are backed mainly by Pakistan and the United
States, have intensified rocket attacks on Kabul, Jalalabad and
Kandahar airports.
   MIDIA, a rebel news agency, said 20 government soldiers were
killed and seven captured in a hit-and-run strike by guerrillas on
Friday near Kandahar airport in the southeast.
   The Marxist government claims the rebels are targeting civilian
populations, causing hundreds of casualties. The insurgents deny the
charges.
   The guerrillas have failed to capture a key Afghan city since
Soviet troops ended nine years of intervention on the government
side in Feb. 15. The Soviets continue to supply arms to the Afghan
government.

   Israeli jets roared over a stronghold of
Shiite Moslem forces in east Lebanon today, touching off false radio
reports of a bombing raid.
   The Voice of Lebanon, the most popular Christian radio station in
east Beirut, and Voice of the Nation, the main broadcaster in the
Moslem sector, were among those to report a raid on Lebanon's Bekaa
valley.
   However, Hezbollah issued a statement saying there was no such
raid, and the Israeli army also denied launching an attack.
   ``There hasn't been any air raid today,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   The spokesman said supersonic jets broke the sound barrier in
reconnaissance runs over the village of Janta and the ancient city
of Baalbek, drawing heavy anti-aircraft fire from Hezbollah's
positions.
   The sonic booms apparently prompted the reports that the Israelis
bombed Janta, 43 miles southeast of Beirut.
   An Israeli army spokeswoman, who could not be identified under
standing military rules, described the report as ``disinformation.''
   An earlier Hezbollah statement today said nine people were killed
and 27 wounded in the Israeli air attack Sunday on a party base in
south Lebanon's village of Ain Abu-Suar.
   The statement said the victims included 15 students wounded when
their school was hit in the attack.
   Police, who had earlier put the toll at three guerrillas killed
and nine wounded, today confirmed Hezbollah's toll.
   Ain Abu-Suar is 40 miles southeast of Beirut near the northern
edge of Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   Sunday's attack was Israel's ninth on Lebanon this year. It
apparently was in retaliation for an Aug. 9 suicide car bomb attack
by a Hezbollah activist in the security zone.
   Five Israeli soldiers and an militiamen of the Israel-backed
South Lebanon Army were wounded.
   Hezbollah said the bombing was to avenge the kidnapping of a
Shiite Moslem cleric, Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, by Israeli commandos
south Lebanon on July 28.
   Israel justified the kidnapping by saying it wanted to trade
Obeid for two soldiers and an airman captured in Lebanon in 1986 and
believed held by Hezbollah.
   It has offered to swap Obeid and other captive Shiites for the
three Israelis and 16 Western hostages, including eight Americans,
most of whom are believed held by groups linked to Hezbollah. The
fundamentalists have rejected the offer.
   Longest held of the hostages in Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle
East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was taken nearly 4{
years ago.
   Israel carved out the security zone, which is 6-10 miles deep,
when its withdrew most of its army from Lebanon in mid-1985
following a three-year occupation.

   Cuban prosecutors at a trial stemming from
their country's drug scandal asked that a former interior minister
be given 20 years in prison for corruption, the island's official
news agency said today.
   Closing arguments in the military trial of Division Gen. Jose
Abrantes Fernandez and six other officials, including the former
vice interior minister and the former head of customs, were made
late Sunday, Prensa Latina said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico
City.
   It did not say when a verdict was expected.
   The trial stems from a drug scandal that has shaken the nation,
belied President Fidel Casto's vision of Communist rectitude, and
sent four officers to the firing squad. One of those killed was a
highly decorated war hero.
   Abrantes was fired as interior minister in June, when 12 military
officials from his ministry and two from the army were charged with
drug smuggling and other crimes. The ones who escaped execution
received sentences of up to 30 years.
   In addition to requesting the 20-year sentence, prosecutors also
told the military tribunal Sunday that Abrantes should be demoted to
private, Prensa Latina said.
   The prosecution said Abrantes fumbled a drug-trafficking
investigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate, but it
said the evidence did not support a charge of treason, Prensa Latina
said.
   It also said he and his co-defendants used their posts to enrich
themselves, according to the agency.
   Abrantes was charged with abusing power, neglecting his duties
and stealing from the government, Prensa Latina said.
   The chief prosecutor said Abrantes was so consumed with ``dollar
fever'' that he traded in Cuban pesos on the black market for his
own profit.
   The prosecution also asked the tribunal to sentence the former
vice interior minister, Division Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil, to 15
years in prison and to demote him to private for abuse of power and
stealing from the government.
   It requested a 13-year sentence for bribery and abuse of power
for Lt. Col. Oscar Carreno Gomez, former head of customs.
   Sentences ranging from 8-12 years were requested for the rest of
the defendants. The charges were similar.

   A student charged with spreading rumors to the
Voice of America during spring pro-democracy protests has been given
a nine-year prison term, a state newspaper reported today. It was
the first announced sentencing of a student participant since the
government's June crackdown.
   The China Youth News said Zhang Weiping, 25, was sentenced
Saturday by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court for spreading
counter-revolutionary propaganda and instigating criminal acts.
   Zhang, a fourth-year student at Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in
the eastern city of Hangzhou, admitted some of the charges against
him but would not acknowledge that his acts were
counter-revolutionary, the daily said.
   The court said that on June 6, two days after the bloody military
crackdown of the student movement in Beijing, Zhang called the
U.S.-funded Voice of America and falsely reported that students in
Hangzhou forced local authorities to fly the Chinese flag at
half-staff to mourn victims of the Beijing massacre.
   It said Zhang sent a tape of the VOA broadcast of his report to
his university, and ``it created a very bad political influence.''
   The court also accused Zhang of drawing eight cartoons vilifying
Communist Party and government leaders.
   The newspaper did not say when Zhang was convicted, but
conviction and sentencing often happen at the same time. It also did
not say under what clause of the criminal code he was tried or what
the maximum sentence was.
   One clause covering counter-revolutionaries who incite the masses
says those found guilty of serious cases shall not serve terms of
less than five years. A counter-revolutionary can get a life term if
the offense is deemed serious enough.
   Chinese police have arrested thousands of workers and students
who took part in the pro-democracy movement and have publicly
sentenced dozens of workers to long prison terms for rioting and
causing social disturbances. At least 12 non-students have been
executed for destroying public property and attacking police.
   Authorities have announced the arrests of eight out of 21 student
leaders put on a nationwide wanted list following the military
crackdown, but so far none has been brought to public trial.
   VOA, which has a large Mandarin-language audience in China, has
been accused by the government of ``rumor-mongering'' in its reports
on the military push to drive students from Tiananmen Square, in
which at least 200 unarmed people were killed.
   The VOA Beijing bureau chief and another VOA reporter were
expelled from China for their reporting activities.
   At Beijing Normal University, classmates of fugitive student
leader Wu'er Kaixi resumed classes today with one week of required
political study.
   The students said they spent their first day of class watching
government videotapes of what is officially called a
``counter-revolutionary rebellion.''
   The tapes, which were already broadcast on official television
this summer, glorify the soldiers, saying they exercised patience
and restraint when faced with ``hooligans'' who threw stones and
bottles and set tanks on fire.
   ``We all know what really happened, though,'' said a sophomore
student from Jiangsu province who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He said none of the students really believed the official version of
the violence.

   If alien creatures ever discover Voyager
2 as it speeds toward the stars, they will find it carries a
recording of Earth's sounds, including rock 'n' roll legend Chuck
Berry's ``Johnny B. Goode.''
   ``I could never be gratified more than being part of that,''
Berry said Sunday night after he belted out his classic song for a
crowd of 1,500 at a party outside NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Berry changed the words a bit, replacing ``Go, Johnny, go!'' with
``Go, Voyager, go!''
   The party _ sponsored by The Planetary Society and televised in
the United States, Japan and Soviet Union _ was a celebration of
Voyager 2's flight past Neptune, the fourth and final planet it
explored during a 12-year trek through the solar system.
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, each carry a 12-inch copper
record containing greetings in 60 languages and a variety of sounds
from Earth in case some extraterrestrial civilization ever stumbles
upon one of the space probes.
   Berry is the only rock artist on the record.
   Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, who devised the Voyager
record and was the emcee at Sunday's party, ended the celebration by
saying, ``I'm going to go get some sleep, or maybe I'll do a little
dancing.''
   Meanwhile, Voyager's photographic imaging team partied at a home
in Pasadena, toasting Voyager's success at Neptune. ``We couldn't
have asked for a more cooperative planet,'' said Voyager project
scientist Edward Stone.

houses, the National Police Agency reported Monday.
   The storm's heavy rain and 55 mph winds triggered flooding and
landslides, and injured 11 people, according to an agency official.
   The official said 1,071 houses were flooded, landslides were
reported at 85 places, and roads were destroyed at 120 sites in
western and northern Japan. The storm crossed from southwestern
Japan to the northernmost island of Hokkaido early Monday.

   A British soldier discovered a bomb
planted beneath his car Monday and the explosive was safely defused,
officials said.
   The bomb was similar to ones used by the Irish Republican Army,
police said.
   It was at least the third attempted bombing at a British military
post in northern Germany this summer. One British soldier was killed
last month in a car bomb that the IRA claimed responsibility for.
   The bomb was set to go off if the car was moved, said
Hans-Juergen Foerster of the West German Federal Prosecutors' Office
in Karlsruhe.
   Police said the soldier found the bomb while searching beneath
his car, as British troops are instructed to do because of the
possibility of IRA attacks.
   West German explosives specialists disarmed the bomb, police said.
   On July 2, a bomb killed a British soldier as he was getting into
his car in a Hanover residential area where many British military
families live.
   A bomb exploded in the living quarters at a British barracks near
Osnabrueck on June 19, but no one was injured. Police also suspect
the IRA in that attack.

   The president of Colombia has denied
reports that his justice minister has resigned from fear of death
threats from drug lords, a White House spokesman said today.
   The minister, Monica de Greiff, is in Washington meeting with
officials of the State and Justice departments about efforts to
break the drug cartels in the South American nation and extradite
those wanted by American prosecutors, spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
   ``As I understand it, our contacts through the (U.S.) embassy
with President (Virgilio) Barco indicate that President Barco has
denied that she has resigned,'' said Popadiuk.
   Asked if the 32-year-old minister has discussed with U.S.
officials the possibility of asylum, the White House official said,
``I do not know of any such discussions.'
   ``President Barco has assured us that there is no truth to the
stories as far as we know in terms of a resignation. ... President
Barco's words are good enough for me,'' said Popadiuk.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Sunday he knew of no
request for political asylum from Mrs. de Greiff, but he said it
``would not be surprising'' in light of the drug lords' violence.
   Popadiuk said Mrs. de Greiff was in Washington ``discussing such
issues as the extradition process.'' Asked if she was still acting
in her official capacity, he replied, ``Absolutely, just as
originally planned.''
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials in Washington said there were tentative
plans for Mrs. de Greiff to meet later today with senior State
Department officials, including Undersecretary of State Robert
Kimmitt.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had
heard unconfirmed reports that the Colombian minister's 3-year-old
son, who accompanied her from Bogota, was the target of a death
threat. They said her place of residence while in Washington aas
being kept secret for security reasons.
   The White House announced Friday that President Bush is sending
$65 million in emergency aid to Colombia for the drug fight. It
includes $5 million to protect judges and other Colombian justice
officials threatened by the drug trafficers, who have warned they
will kill 20 judges for each drug trafficker extradited to the
United States.
   Bush was asked as he teed off for golf this morning if he has
approved any covert action to fight the Colombian drug lords. He
replied: ``If I discussed covert action it wouldn't be covert. I
don't discuss that kind of thing at all.''
   He cautioned reporters that his words should not be interpreted
as a ``yes or a no or a confirm or a deny.''
   Asked if he was concerned that drug-fighting efforts might be
undermined by resignations of Colombian officials, he said, ``I'm
not concerned about anything. It's my vacation. That's what you're
supposed to do on vacation is relax.''
   On Tuesday, Bush is to huddle with Thornburgh, drug policy
director William J. Bennett and other top administration officials
at the president's compound here to discuss the drug strategy he
will unveil Sept. 5.
   Meanwhile, the president had another frustrating fishing trip
this morning, failing to catch a fish for the 13th day of his 20-day
vacation.
   Bush engaged in what he called a sports ``quintathalon'' on
Sunday: jogging, tennis, horsheshoes, softball and fishing.
   A double in softball allowed him to boast of his hitting prowess,
but he was still looking for his first fish.
   He and wife Barbara also squeezed in a pair of church services _
one abbreviated _ with visiting evangelist Billy Graham and his wife
Ruth.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his family arrive
Wednesday for an overnight visit, and on Friday Bush will make a
brief trip back to the White House to meet Japan's new prime
minister, Toshiki Kaifu.
   In other matters, the vacation White House announced today that:
   _Bush formally asked Congress for a 3.6 percent pay raise for
federal civilian workers effective in January 1990, as previously
agreed to in budget negotiations.
   The president noted in a letter to leaders of Congress that pay
advisers had recommended a 28.6 percent raise for the civil
servants, but said that was out of the question. The administration
originally suggested a 2 percent raise.
   _Bush warned South Korea that he may bar fish imports if it does
not reach an agreement with the United States on driftnet fishing in
the next 30 days.
   _The National Teacher of the Year, Mary V. Bicouvaris of Bethel
High School in Hampton, Va., was named to the Commission on
President Scholars, succeeding a former top teacher, Tennessee's
Terry Weeks.
   _Bush will appoint Craig I. Fields to the new National Commission
on Superconductivity. Fields, 43, is director of the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington, Va.

   Masked Sikh gunmen raided a passenger
train in Punjab state and massacred at least 22 Hindu passengers, a
senior police official said today.
   At least 30 others were wounded in the attack on the
Suratgarh-to-Bhatinda train late Sunday, said K.P.S. Gill, director
general of police in the northern state.
   But the English-language Tribune newspaper in the state capital,
Chandigarh, said 70 people had been killed and 150 wounded.
   Gill said 12 Sikh militants, armed with automatic rifles, stopped
the train, stormed three of its five cars, and separated the Hindu
passengers from the Sikhs before opening fire on the Hindus.
   The attack occurred at Qabarwala in Fridkot district. The area is
85 miles south of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar and about 25 miles
from the Pakistan border.
   Gill said the train, carrying 450 people, had four armed security
guards to protect passengers from such an attack. He said the
attackers fled before the guards could intervene.
   Sikh radicals have been fighting for an independent nation in
Punjab since 1982. They say they suffer discrimination at the hands
of India's Hindu majority.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, and
Sikhs account for 2 percent. However, they are in a slight majority
in Punjab.
   At least 1,224 deaths this year have been blamed on Sikh radicals
in Punjab.
   In a similar attack in August 1988, Sikh radicals raided a train
and killed 11 Hindus.

   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall was sentenced to one
year in prison today for lying to a federal grand jury about a loan
he negotiated with an undercover agent posing as a drug-money
launderer.
   U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman also imposed a $30,000
fine plus a $450 fee against Swindall, who was convicted on nine
counts of perjury in June.
   The prison term was 12 months on each count, to run concurrently.
   Swindall, a two-term Republican from Atlanta's eastern suburbs,
spoke to the judge for about half an hour in rambling remarks that
frequently touched on issues in the trial. But Freeman told him
several times that this was not the place to retry his case.
   ``I stand before you in all humility,'' he told the judge at one
point, but Freeman interrupted him, saying, ``You don't know the
meaning of humility, Mr. Swindall. I thought you were beginning to
learn it, but I'm afraid you're not.''
   After the judge imposed the sentence, Swindall smiled and shook
hands with his attorneys. The judge said the congressman will remain
free on his own recognizance pending an appeal of the conviction.
   Swindall later told reporters he thought the sentence was proper
for someone guilty of perjury.
   ``I have no complaints whatsoever. The problem I have is not the
length of the sentence, but whether it should have been imposed at
all,'' he said.
   When U.S. Attorney Robert Barr was asked if the government was
satisfied with the relatively light sentence, he replied, ``It's not
really up to us to be satisfied. We thought a more lengthy sentence
was called for.''
   Attorneys for both sides argued briefly before Freeman announced
his decision. Defense attorneys said federal sentencing guidelines
called for 10 to 16 months in prison and urged the judge to impose
even less than that.
   The prosecution argued that the guidelines called for a sentence
of 37 to 46 months, but in imposing the 12-month sentence Freeman
said he disagreed with the government's interpretation of the
guidelines.
   The judge recommended that Swindall serve his sentence at a
minimum-security federal prison camp in Atlanta.
   The courtroom was packed for today's 1{-hour hearing, and an
overflow of about a dozen people stood outside the closed door as
prosecutors and defense attorneys presented their arguments on the
sentence.
   Evidence in his trial showed that Swindall repeatedly talked with
the undercover agent and a political associate as he was seeking
$850,000 to finish his luxurious Stone Mountain home, even after a
time when he told the grand jury he had ``walked away'' from the
proposed deal.
   The congressman, who had been introduced to the money man by
political associate Charles LeChasney, ultimately accepted and
endorsed a $150,000 check before backing out of the deal.
   The jury found Swindall guilty of deliberately telling 18 lies to
the grand jury.
   Swindall was largely unknown politically before he won the
congressional seat in 1984, upsetting veteran Democrat Elliott
Levitas. He was re-elected in 1986, but lost in 1988 to Democrat Ben
Jones while under the cloud of his perjury indictment.
   Swindall sought a speedy trial before the 1988 election in hopes
of getting an acquittal and preserving his career, but the trial was
aborted after Swindall campaign mailings, maintaining his innocence,
reached members of the jury.
   Earlier this year, Swindall had hoped to make a comeback against
veteran Democrat Nunn in 1990.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Buries Victims of Israel's Deadliest Air Raid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran's militia allies held funerals Monday
for the victims of the deadliest Israeli raid of 1989, and buried
them in the Shiite Moslem country of south Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, said nine people were killed and 27
wounded in the six-minute air strike Sunday on a Hezbollah base in
Ain Abu-Suar village. It identified the dead as three guerrillas and
six civilians, and claimed 15 children were wounded by a rocket that
hit a school.
   Police confirmed the Hezbollah figures, but said all nine dead
were guerrillas. They said the school building had been abandoned
long ago and Hezbollah used it as an ammunition dump.
   In Beirut, the Foreign Ministry said it had instructed Lebanon's
acting delegate to the United Nations, Shawki Shweiri, to complain
about the raid to the Security Council.
   The death toll at Ain Abu-Suar was the highest of Israel's nine
air raids in Lebanon this year. By police count, eight people were
killed and 67 wounded in the eight previous raids.
   Israeli jets broke the sound barrier in reconnaissance flights
Monday over the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon, drawing anti-aircraft
fire from Hezbollah positions in Janta village and the ancient city
of Baalbek.
   Beirut radio stations mistook the sonic booms for bomb
explosions, but police, Hezbollah and the Israeli military said the
planes did not attack.
   Five bodies from the Sunday raid were taken from hospital morgues
in Beirut and sent to south Lebanon in a convoy of seven buses, 20
cars and two ambulances for burial in their hometowns.
   Hezbollah militiamen escorting the flag-bedecked motorcade fired
in the air in a traditional Lebanese expression of mourning. In
Sidon, the convoy divided, taking two victims to the southern port
of Tyre and three to Nabatiyeh, an inland market town.
   About 100 mourners buried the other four in the Ain Abu-Suar
cemetery, clenching their fists and chanting ``Death to Israel!''
and ``Death to America!'' Armed militiamen prevented photographers
from taking pictures and reporters were kept at a distance of 200
yards.
   ``It's a security precaution for your own safety,'' a Hezbollah
guerrilla said. ``The Israelis might be tempted to strike again if
there is a big gathering.''
   Ain Abu-Suar is on the northern edge of Israel's ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon, a border area 6 to 10 miles deep patrolled
jointly by Israeli soldiers and a predominantly Christian surrogate
militia called the South Lebanon Army.
   Sunday's raid was an apparent response to a suicide truck bomb
attack in the zone Aug. 9 that wounded five Israeli soldiers and an
allied militiaman.
   Hezbollah said the suicide bombing was vengeance for the Israeli
kidnapping July 28 of Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, a Shiite cleric
associated with the group.
   Israel has offered to trade him for three captured Israel
soldiers and the 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, who include eight
Americans. Hezbollah is believed to sponsor Shiite groups that hold
most of the hostages.

<HEAD>Cities Say Funds Lacking In Aid To Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortages of funds are hampering city halls in
dealing with child care, teen-age pregnancy and other problems of
children, the National League of Cities said Monday in appealing for
long-term federal assistance.
   Releasing the results of a survey of 390 cities, the league said
the need for child care overshadows all other needs for children
under 9. Over that age, the top concern of city officials shifts to
such preventive issues as alcohol and drug abuse and teen pregnancy.
   Among cities with populations less than 300,000, nearly half said
money was their chief problem in dealing with these problems.
Seventy percent of the cities of more than 300,000 cited lack of
funds.
   ``This report is a sobering slap of reality that should awaken
our national conscience,'' said James P. Moran Jr., mayor of
Alexandria, Va., and chairman of the league's human development
policy committee.
   ``Much has been documented about the condition and need for
investment in the roads, bridges and public facilities that are the
physical infrastructure of our cities,'' Moran said. ``But we don't
have much solid information about our children and families. They
are the social infrastructure of our cities and towns.''
   Moran said the new study provides ``a very solid profile'' to
fill this gap in information, and ``the needs portrayed in this
report are both local and national.''
   ``We need help, and we need it now,'' the Virginia mayor said.
``We also need real commitments over the long run, not the kind of
federal aid that is here one year and gone the next.''
   Cities are already taking steps to deal with the problems, the
report said:
   _In Pico Rivera, Calif., recreation leaders escort children to a
local park after school for activities until parents, who pay $10 a
week for the service, can pick them up.
   _In Jacksonville, Fla., the city in cooperation with Barnett Bank
and the state Department of Health and Rehabilitiative Services
developed a program to train mothers who are on welfare to operate
family day care homes.
   _In Boise, Idaho, the city funds 10 apartments and places
homeless families with children in them for up to two months
rent-free.
   _In West Seneca, N.Y., the Juvenile Bureau has substance abuse
prevention programs in 5th and 7th grades and presented these and
other programs to 6,600 students last year.
   Also cited in the report were the nation's only city-operated day
care accreditation program, in San Antonio, Texas; a teen-age
pregnancy education program in Spokane, Wash.; and an advisory
council made up of children and adults that advises the Oakland,
Calif., City Council on young people's issues.
   ``From coast to coast, cities are working on these issues in
innovative ways,'' the report said. ``They predict their involvement
will increase over time _ except there is no money to support
expansion.''
   The study, entitled, ``Our Future and Our Only Hope,'' covered
278 cities with populations above 50,000, and 112 smaller cities.
   Moran said the survey of larger cities, covering 60 percent of
all those in the nation, was much broader than that for the smaller
communities, but nevertheless ``most of the findings run parallel
for the smaller cities and can be regarded as generally good
indicators.''
   Among the 278 larger cities, 63 percent ranked child care as the
most pressing need for children up to 2 years old, 80 percent for
children ages 2 to 5, and 69 percent for children ages 5 to 9.
   Thirty percent indentified alchol and drugs as the most pressing
issue for children ages 9 to 14, and 25 percent for ages 14 to 18.
In the 14 to 18 group, teen pregnancy was next at 22 percent.
   Among cities of from 50,000 to 100,000 population, 44 percent
said lack of money was the chief barrier to greater city hall
involvement. Thise rose to 50 percent in cities of 100,000 to
300,000 and 70 percent in larger cities.
   ``What it all comes down to in the end is not just will, but also
money,'' said Moran.

   A half-century after World War II broke out
across Europe, half of all Americans expect World War III one day _
and most think it would end in nuclear devastation, a poll has found.
   Of those who foresaw another war, six in 10 expected it within
two decades, the Media General-Associated Press poll found. And if
world war does break out, 54 percent feared its escalation into
all-out nuclear war.
   A majority of respondents also said one of the darkest episodes
of World War II could recur: A holocaust on the order of Nazi
Germany's murders of more than 6 million Jews, gassed, starved or
shot in concentration camps.
   The poll, conducted among 1,163 adults, asked: ``Do you think
that kind of thing could happen again _ that is, the killing of
millions of people because of their religion or ethnic background?''
Six in 10 said it could.
   World War II erupted on Sept. 1, 1939, when more than a million
German troops invaded Poland. The war soon consumed Europe, North
Africa and the Far East, claiming an estimated 50 million lives
before it ended in 1945.
   The United States joined the war in 1941 after the Japanese, who
were allied with the Germans, attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Poll respondents overwhelmingly expressed the
view that the Nazis would have conquered Western Europe had the
United States not intervened.
   In the Pacific, the United States hastened Japan's surrender in
1945 by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki _ still the
only time nuclear weapons have been detonated in a war.
   Six in 10 poll respondents said the Hiroshima bombing, in which
death estimates run as high as 200,000, was the right thing to do.
Seventy percent of the men in the survey supported the bombing; half
the women agreed.
   With Japan now one of the world's leading economic powers, nearly
four in 10 said the United States did too much to help rebuild Japan
after the war. Two in 10 said they sometimes think of Japan as the
enemy because of the war.
   Germany fared better: Just one in 10 said they sometimes think of
it as the enemy, and 24 percent said the United States did too much
to help rebuild West Germany, also one of the world's strongest
economies today.
   Respondents strongly supported the reunification of Germany,
which was divided into democratic West Germany and communist East
Germany after the war. Seventy percent favored reunification.
   Nearly seven in 10 considered themselves to be familiar with the
events of World War II. Older people were far more apt to rate
themselves as ``very familiar'' with the war; 57 percent of those
older than 64 chose that category, compared with just 12 percent of
those younger than 45.
   There was no division by age in familiarity with one aspect of
the war: A near-unanimous 95 percent said they had heard of the
Holocaust.
   Older respondents were less likely to believe there will be
another world war but were more likely to expect that if one
occurred it would escalate into nuclear war. The expectation of
another world war was greater among women than men, 53-44 percent,
and women were more inclined to fear nuclear escalation of a world
war, 60-48 percent.
   Of the 49 percent who foresaw another world war, 6 percent said
it was likely within five years, 29 percent within 10 years and 26
percent within 20 years. Thus 61 percent of this group _ or 30
percent of all respondents _ expected World War III within two
decades.
   The poll was conducted by telephone July 7-16 among a random
sample of adults in the continental United States. It has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Media General Inc., a communications company based in Richmond,
Va., publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult in the house who had the
most recent birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times
its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult
American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger
for subgroups; it is 8 points, for example, for respondents 65 and
older.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. How familiar would you say you are with the events of World
War II _ very familiar, somewhat familiar, not too familiar or not
at all familiar? Very: 24 percent. Somewhat: 45 percent. Not too: 24
percent. Not at all: 7 percent.
   2. Do you think there will be another world war at some point, or
not? Yes: 49. No: 43. Don't know or no answer: 9.
   3. (If yes) Do you think that's likely to happen within five
years, within 10 years, within 20 years, or is it farther off than
that? Five: 6. Ten: 29. Twenty: 26. Farther off: 28. DK-NA: 11.
   4. If there is another world war, do you think it will escalate
into an all-out nuclear war, or not? Yes: 54. No: 38. DK-NA: 9.
   5. Do you sometimes think of Germany as the enemy because of
World War II, or do you think that's all behind us? Enemy: 10.
Behind: 84. DK-NA: 6.
   6. Do you sometimes think of Japan as the enemy because of World
War II, or do you think that's all behind us? Enemy: 20. Behind: 74.
DK-NA: 7.
   7. Germany was divided into two countries after World War II _
East Germany and West Germany. Would you support or oppose their
coming together again as one country? Support: 70. Oppose: 12.
DK-NA: 18.
   8. Would you say the United States did too much to help rebuild
West Germany after the war, too little, or was it about right? Too
much: 24. Too little: 4. About right: 55. DK-NA: 16.

   A court Monday rejected the appeal
of an underground publisher who was sentenced to 2{ years in prison
following his conviction on incitement charges, the state news
agency said.
   Frantisek Starek was convicted of ``manufacturing and duplicating
written documents hostile to the socialist state,'' the news agency
CTK said. The maximum sentence he could have received is five years
in jail.
   The court also rejected the appeal for Starek's fiancee, Iva
Vojtkova, who received two years' probation after being convicted of
complicity, CTK said.
   The June 28 conviction of Starek was one of a series of trials
this year in a crackdown on dissent in Czechoslovakia.
   Starek, 36, has spent 38 months in jail in the past 13 years and
undergone repeated police harassment for his involvement in
independent culture.
   He was arrested on Feb. 23 on the incitement charge. Police
searched his home and confiscated his typewriter, his computer and
printer, and a complete, unpublished issue of Vokno, his
self-published periodical.

   Confining killer whales in tanks to perform
generates jobs, good times for the public and money for Sea World,
but the practice is being questioned since a fight between two of
the mammals ended in death.
   Some biologists say that killer whales in the open ocean don't
fight and that putting them in tanks makes them neurotic and
aggressive toward each other.
   Sea World denies captivity played a role in the deadly Aug. 21
fight between two female whales. The National Marine Fisheries
Service, which regulates display of marine mammals, agreed with Sea
World that the death was an accident.
   Killer whales, also called orcas, are a prime attraction at San
Diego's Sea World and three sister Sea Worlds, so the acts are
important to the economic well-being of the parks and 4,800
year-round employees.
   As part of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s parks division, the
four Sea Worlds, with two other amusement parks, last year generated
$61.8 million in income on $338 million in revenue. No income
breakdowns for individual parks are available. HBJ's parks division
is on the market for a reported $1.3 billion.
   Sea World officials defend the park as more than a money-making
enterprise.
   Youngsters often ``come away with knowledge they didn't have
before and a fascination that doesn't go away,'' Sea World
veterinarian Jim McBain said. ``They become advocates for the marine
environment.''
   Nonetheless, captivity could have been a key factor in Kandu's
death, said Ken Balcomb, a research biologist at the Center for
Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Wash.
   ``I'm pretty sure virtually all animals in captivity develop
neuroses,'' he said. ``You do have a stress factor. It's pretty much
a caged mentality they have to live with.''
   The park's 11-month-old Baby Shamu was orphaned when her mother,
Kandu, collided with a performing partner, Corky, in a
5-million-gallon pool.
   The 3-ton Kandu's upper jaw was fractured and she bled to death
before thousands of spectators. It was the first killer whale to die
in a fight in the park's 25-year history.
   Corky, weighing 8,000 pounds, is believed to be about 25 years
old.
   About 30 members of the group Friends of Whales picketed Sea
World on Saturday, protesting the confinement of killer whales. One
protester held up a sign reading, ``Is it `fun' to see animals die
in captivity?' ''
   Sea World officials have said that most of the public reaction
since Kandu's death has been sympathetic and favorable.
   McBain said 14-year-old Kandu's actions were normal for killer
whales, which are not known to have ever killed humans but are
skillful, efficient hunters. They eat mostly fish or seals but also
attack other whale species.
   McBain said they butt, chase and nip each other while
establishing and maintaining social hierarchies.
   But Balcomb, who has monitored orcas off San Juan Island, Wash.,
for 13 years, said such whale rivalries are nonexistent at sea.
   ``In the wild, they don't solve their problems aggressively,''
Balcomb said. ``It's not normal. Killer whales travel in kinship
groups or clans and they don't have those aggressive interactions.
If other whales come along from a different group, they just avoid
each other. Obviously, you can't do that in a tank.''
   McBain acknowledged that past pools were too small and probably
contributed to earlier failed breeding efforts and premature deaths
of killer whales, first captured for display in the mid-1960s. Shamu
Stadium in San Diego, built in 1987, more than quadrupled the killer
whales' quarters.
   Also in 1987, trainers were pulled from the water for several
months after a series of accidents in which whales injured trainers.
Trainers were allowed to return to the water last year under
stricter safety guidelines.
   Just how long killer whales live at sea and how that compares to
captive orcas remain an area of debate. Some biologists believe a
female whale lives up to 80 years in the wild while the maximum for
a male is about 50.
   In captivity, killer whales on average have died within eight
years, primarily because of infection, according to Balcomb.
   But McBain said Corky remains in good condition after 21 years of
captivity.
   Corky and Baby Shamu are among three whales remaining at the San
Diego park. Twelve others are at Sea Worlds in San Antonio, Texas;
Aurora, Ohio, and Orlando, Fla. Four other calves have been born in
captivity over the past four years, Sea World spokesman Dan LeBlanc
said.

   About 5,000 farmers from the
breadbasket province of Vojvodina on Monday rallied in front of the
federal parliament to demand higher selling prices for their produce.
   The farmers are angry about the government's attempts to control
runaway inflation by forcing food prices down.
   At Monday's rally in a driving rain, farmers demanded that
state-controlled food prices cover the cost of production.
   ``It is cows which should be milked, not peasants,'' said one
sign. ``After paying taxes, the peasant has only his underpants,''
read another.
   Farmers in Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia, of which
Vojvodina is a part, objected to a recent government decision to
flood the market with cheap flour, wheat, sugar and other foods from
federal stockpiles to try to halt constant price rises on those
items.
   Agriculture Minister Stevo Mirjanic said Aug. 9 that past
governments were to blame for the poor state of Yugoslav
agriculture, and he promised higher guaranteed prices for farm
products. The Tanjug news agency said the government planned to
review agricultural problems Oct. 5.
   The protest had been intended to draw farmers from all over
Yugoslavia, but the rally fell victim to the divisive disputes among
the country's six constituent republics. Farmers from Croatia and
Slovenia pulled out because they saw the protest as a Serbian move
to rattle the federal government of Ante Markovic, a Croat under
fierce attack from Serbian politicians.

   Aircraft designer Jack Northrop's dream for more
than three decades was a jet that would combine the flying wing
design with ``stealth'' technology, making it virtually impossible
for enemy radar to detect. The B-2 stealth bomber flew its maiden
voyage this summer, and the pending decision on whether to begin
full-scale production will help determine the face of American air
power into the next century.

<TEXT>
   Jack Northrop, the aircraft designer and
founder of the California company bearing his name, was obsessed
with the flying wing. But for more than three decades, the Air Force
shunned it as a flight of fancy.
   Then, in the end, it embraced Northrop's dream to build the B-2
``Stealth'' bomber, the world's most expensive airplane at current
estimates of $530 million apiece.
   Now Congress must decide whether the United States can afford to
build a plane the military says it can't afford to do without.
   Northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of the
flying wing _ chiefly, its reduced liklihood of being detected by
radar _ as a side benefit, a nice selling point to the military, for
what he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane. A
flying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventional
airplane of the same weight. It therefore is more efficient, meaning
it requires less power and less fuel, and can carry a greater
payload.
   ``Any reasonable assumptions,'' Northrop said in 1947, ``will
always result in advantage to the all-wing configuration, of such
magnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations may
be involved in its development.''
   In 1981, as the headlines focused on Ronald Reagan's resurrection
of the B-1 program canceled by Jimmy Carter, Jack Northrop, then
retired and near death, was given a special security clearance so
Pentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34
years earlier. The Air Force had finally contracted with the company
bearing his name to build a flying wing as the nation's flagship
strategic bomber.
   Long before the public got its first glimpse of the B-2, Air
Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch declared that ``the aerodynamic
design ... is markedly more efficient than that of its
predecessors.'' The B-2, he continued, ``requires far fewer tankers
... and carries a very healthy bomb load. It would be a superb
bomber even if it weren't stealthy.''
   Aside from military considerations, some aviation buffs are
rooting for full development and production of the B-2 because of
its potential spin-offs for commercial flight. According to Tim
Wooldridge of the National Air and Space Museum, airlines and air
transport companies have long flirted with the notion of an all-wing
design for ``span-loaders'' that could fly tremendous distances
carrying huge weights _ oil, for example. ``But nobody's willing to
bet the billions of dollars it would cost'' for feasibility
research, he notes. ``What airline would bet that kind of money?''
   To some in Congress, the billions that will be needed to build a
fleet of B-2's look like a questionable bet, as well.
   By current estimates, each one will cost about $530 million. Put
another way, a single B-2 will cost $100 million more than Toronto's
spectacular Skydome, the world's newest and fanciest sports stadium,
replete with hotel, restaurants and retractable roof. The extra $100
million would buy a major league baseball team.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``Members of Congress are balking at
spending $4.1 billion this year for the Strategic Defense
Initiative. It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much
per year on a plane.''
   ``This was the worst kind of public policy,'' said Rep. John R.
Kasich, R-Ohio. ``To keep something secret all this time and drive
the cost up to $22 billion (to date) will never be tolerated again.''
   The Air Force rejects such criticism, suggesting that some
members of Congress are being coy with their constituents now that
the cost estimates are public after eight years of top-secret
development. ``The charge that someone was hiding anything from the
Congress is ludicrous,'' said Larry Welch, the Air Force chief of
staff. ``There were dozens and dozens of people in the Congress who
were fully aware of all the details.''
   But Rep. Myke Synar, D-Okla, said, ``I attended classified
briefings by the Air Force and by Northrop which frankly left a lot
to be desired. They were not straightforward, they were not candid
and, in many ways, they were very confusing.''
   Synar charged that Northrop had ``miserably failed to manage this
program.'' Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello
agreed, saying he had ``serious and grave concerns'' about
Northrop's management, and that the firm's quality controls were
``terrible.''
   Northrop's chairman, Thomas V. Jones, vigorously defended the
company and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders, saying the
program had produced an ``extraordinary new aircraft system'' and
``unprecedented technical successes.''
   The nation's first B-2 bomber made its public debut this summer,
18 months later than scheduled. It taxied slowly from its hanger at
Northrop's plant in Palmdale, Calif., and turned onto runway 04 the
morning of July 17. Chief Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, who
hadn't been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for the
honor, ran up the plane's four General Electric engines and released
the brakes at 9:36 a.m. EDT. Twenty-three seconds later, the B-2 was
airborne.
   ``The aircraft was very stable; rock stable,'' Hinds reported
later. ``It's going to be a very easy airplane to fly.''
   But not to sell. Before the August congressional recess, the
House limited B-2 production to two planes next year and two the
year after that _ half what the Bush administration wants. It also
ordered the Pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper production
program. The Senate was kinder; it trimmed only $300 million from
the $4.7 billion sought by the president for the B-2 next year. A
compromise bill may be crafted next month.
   Meanwhile, the Air Force has scrambled to redefine the B-2's
mission and capability. Originally conceived as a purely strategic
bomber to seek out and destroy the Soviet Union's mobile missiles in
a nuclear war, it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfire
weapon as well.
   Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command,
argues that the B-2 would have been ideal, had it been available,
for the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya. ``Just three to four B-2s could
have done the job directly from stateside bases,'' Randolph said.
   That's a remarkable switch in Air Force thinking. When the raid
was planned by a young Marine lieutenant colonel named Oliver North,
he inquired about having the already operational F-117A stealth
fighter-bomber do the job, according to Bill Sweetman, a noted
aviation writer and author of ``Stealth Bomber.''
   The Air Force turned North down cold, saying the plane was too
valuable to risk on such a venture.
   The question arises: if that is true of the F-117, thought to
cost about $100 million per plane, why wouldn't it be true of the
B-2, at more than half a billion dollars?

   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran
appeared Monday to have won parliamentary approval for Foreign
Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, his main ally, but members criticized
three other Cabinet nominees.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said 22 deputies spoke
at Monday's session, the second day of debate on the Cabinet, and at
least eight more were to address the 270-seat Majlis before
individual votes Tuesday on the nominees.
   Rafsanjani, 55, is known as a pragmatist and seeks renewed ties
with the West to ensure a flow of technology and money needed to
rebuild the economy after eight years of war with Iraq. He also
wants to encourage private investment.
   Velayati, foreign minister since 1981 and a staunch ally of
Rafsanjani, is expected to steer Iran more toward the West.
   There had been fears the Majlis would reject Velayati because
Rafsanjani failed to comply with a petition from 138 members asking
that he keep his main radical opponent, Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, in the Cabinet.
   Left off the Cabinet list with Mohtashemi were his two allies,
outgoing Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Intelligence Minister
Mohammad Reyshehri. The new constitution made the presidency more
powerful and abolished the post of prime minister.
   The news agency said Monday's speakers supported Velayati
``because of the backing he had received from the late Imam'' _
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3, a decade after leading
the Islamic revolution to power.
   Support for Velayati was accompanied by criticism of his ministry
for employing ``Iranian graduates from abroad who lack a combatant
and revolutionary record,'' IRNA said.
   Mohammad Ali Najafi, a 38-year-old Massachusetts Institute of
Technology graduate chosen as education minister, appeared to be the
least popular of Rafsanjani's candidates, possibly because of his
Western background.
   IRNA said most of those who spoke Monday urged the rejection of
Najafi, who has been education minister for a year and also held the
higher education portfolio in previous governments.
   Public criticism of the education system has increased. Many
officials believe standards have dropped because of lack of funds to
open new schools and the flight of foreign-educated technocrats and
teachers after the revolution.
   Rafsanjani had predicted hard-liners in the Majlis would veto his
foreign-educated candidates.
   In a speech opening the debate Sunday, the new president said:
``Studying at American universities was not and is not a negative
point. Many (Iranians) who studied abroad have provided valuable
services to this country.''
   Abdallah Nouri, the candidate to succeed Mohtashemi as interior
minister, was praised Monday as ``a sharp, witty planner,'' but
speakers criticized Ali Fallahiyan, chosen to replace the radical
Reyshehri as intelligence minister, IRNA reported.
   It quoted Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, a Tehran member, as saying
Fallahiyan, who was Reyshehri's deputy, lacked ``the necessary
planning ability to take over the job.''
   Abdolhussein Vahaji, nominated to move up from deputy commerce
minister to the top job, was blamed for many of the ministry's
current problems, the agency said.
   The department has been without a minister for more than a year
because the Majlis has failed to approve at least two previous
candidates.
   Deputies said Vahaji displayed ``weak management'' abilities as
deputy commerce minister and expressed ``doubt whether he could
change things for the better,'' IRNA said.
   Rafsanjani was elected president July 28, and given unprecedented
executive powers in constitutional reforms approved in a referendum
the same day.

<HEAD>Large Harvest Softens U.S. Oats Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A larger harvest has taken the edge off the
booming U.S. oats market that has attracted imports from Canada,
Sweden and other foreign suppliers, an Agriculture Department report
said Monday.
   In the 1988-89 marketing year that ended May 31, U.S. oats
imports rose to about 68 million bushels, or nearly 1 million metric
tons, a 50 percent increase from 1987-88.
   The United States has been the world's largest importer of oats
since 1983-84, including large increases the last two or three years
as consumers discovered the grain's health benefits.
   ``Research has linked the fiber content of oats with lower serum
cholesterol levels, and health concerns have buoyed the demand for
oat food products,'' the report said.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 68.9 bushels
of oats. A bushel of oats weights 32 pounds, little more than half
that of wheat.
   Oats imports in 1989-90 are forecast to settle back to around 50
million bushels, or about 725,000 tons, but the United States is
expected to remain as the dominant buyer in the world market, the
report said.
   U.S. production this year is expected to rise 74 percent from the
drought-stricken 1988 harvest to 381 million bushels, or about 5.53
million tons, according to USDA forecasts.
   The USDA says oats prices nationally may average in the range of
$1.55 to $1.95 per bushel in 1989-90, compared with $2.61 estimated
for 1988-89.

   Voyager 2 found Neptune's moon Triton to
be a world in which volcanoes blast nitrogen ice 20 miles skyward
and where giant craters once overflowed with ocean-size floods of
frozen lava, scientists believe.
   If scientists are correct in their interpretation of Voyager's
photographs, Triton is only the third object in the universe where
active volcanoes have been identified.
   ``It's one of the most interesting and provocative worlds in the
solar system,'' says Charles Kohlhase, Voyager spacecraft mission
design manager at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras _ somewhat like Earth's northern and southern
lights _ in several places in Neptune's skies and over much of the
day side of Triton, Roger Yelle, of the University of Arizona, said
today.
   The auroras are invisible to the human eye because they are
caused by electrically charged solar wind particles exciting
hydrogen gas to produce ultraviolet light, and they occur at odd
places because of Neptune's tilted magnetic field, Yelle said. When
the particles are pulled toward Earth's poles along magnetic field
lines, they excite nitrogen and oxygen gases to cause visisble
auroras.
   Voyager today snapped and sent back to Earth beautiful
photographs showing the sunlit, crescent edges of Neptune and Triton
as they were backlighted by the sun. NASA expects to release prints
of the photo no earlier than Tuesday.
   Triton apparently has three types of volcanic activity.
   Scientists announced two of them Friday: huge inactive
crater-shaped volcanoes, called calderas, filled with lava made of
ice instead of molten rock; and long fault-line valleys filled with
oozing ice, a process likened to toothpaste coming out of a tube
slit with a razor blade.
   Triton's biggest surprise came Sunday, when U.S. Geological
Survey geologist Laurence Soderblom announced that a third kind of
volcanic activity apparently had been identified. The latest
recorded photographs sent by Voyager reveal what look like active
ice volcanoes that erupt explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles
and gas 12 to 20 miles high.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said University of Arizona planetary scientist Bradford Smith,
leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Soderblom cautioned that the volcanic theory could turn out to be
a ``crazy idea,'' but other scientists expressed their support.
   ``It sounds like a very reasonable hypothesis,'' said Voyager
project scientist Edward Stone.
   Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune in addition to
Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It also has
found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including two that
are broad bands of dust.
   By 9 p.m. PDT tonight, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.65 million miles from Neptune, speeding toward
interstellar space at 37,600 mph.
   As the craft sped toward the ill-defined boundary of the solar
system, about 1,500 mission scientists, engineers and their families
celebrated at a bash that featured rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry
singing ``Go, Voyager, go!'' a slightly modified version of his
classic ``Johnny B. Goode.''
   A recording of that song and other earth sounds was among the
cultural and historical items aboard aboard Voyager.
   The spacecraft made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday
night when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole
cloudtops. Early Friday, it zoomed about 24,000 miles past Triton.
Since then, it has been sending back recorded photos that revealed
Triton's volcanic activity.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes to
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. But he said the
volcanoes on Triton are produced when liquid nitrogen in underground
pools rises to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got
to explode and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   ``I believe they are active,'' Soderblom said. ``There's 10 or 20
or 30 _ lots.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject frosty debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps
faster.
   Smith said the deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened
ices that fell to the surface after being carried skyward by the
blast.
   Earth's volcanoes spew molten rock, and Io's erupts sulfur. Venus
also may have active volcanoes, but none has been spotted on the
cloud-shrouded planet.
   On Sunday, NASA also revealed more surprises about Triton's
apparently inactive caldera-like volcanoes, which measure up to
hundreds of miles wide and fill with what Smith described as flows
of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that gushes up from below.
   The new photos show Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can come up and
overflow,'' Smith said. ``You see that happen in Hawaii all the
time'' when lava overflows calderas such as the one atop Kilauea
volcano.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions, resulting in massive,
oceanic-scale flooding, Soderblom said.
   A volcano is considered active if it has erupted within the 100
years. Smith said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes erupted within the past century because they are located
on Triton's huge south polar ice cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.

   Ethnic rivalry has voters charged up to go to the
polls Tuesday in a special election for the late Claude Pepper's
U.S. House seat.
   Hispanics appear to be rallying around GOP state Sen. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen, who stands to become the first Cuban-American in
Congress. Many non-Latin whites and blacks seem to favor Gerald
Richman, a Brooklyn-born, Jewish attorney.
   If those patterns hold up, recent polls indicate a photo-finish.
   Dade County Elections Supervisor David Leahy on Monday predicted
up to a 45 percent turnout, unusually high for a special election.
   ``There has been a tremendous amount of media exposure and we
think both camps are getting a lot more people out to vote,'' he
said.
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, whose name is pronounced ill-ee-AHN-ah
ross-LAYT-tih-nen, campaigned Monday with U.S. Sen. Connie Mack
among senior citizens on Miami Beach. Richman campaigned across
Miami Beach and with black ministers in Miami.
   Polls last week indicated the two were neck-and-neck and that
most voters would put heritage ahead of partisanship when they
choose between Ms. Ros-Lehtinen and Richman, who has come under fire
for saying he's running for ``an American seat.''
   There are more than 100,000 registered Democrats in the district
Pepper held 27 years for the Democrats until his death May 30 at age
88, while there are 71,000 Republicans and 14,000 independents.
Blacks make up 19 percent of the voters and Hispanics more than 40
percent, with the rest non-Latin whites.
   Cuban-Americans are expected to turn out in high numbers for Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen, 37.
   Richman, a 48-year-old former Florida Bar Association president,
hoped for strong turnout from the traditional coalition of Jewish
retirees and black Democrats. The coalition's power has been eroded
by the Latin influx into South Florida.
   After Richman, in his first try for office, trounced Cuban-born
former city Commissioner Rosario Kennedy in the Aug. 15 Democratic
runoff, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen accused him of running a bigoted campaign
and refused to make appearances with him.
   Ms. Kennedy refused to endorse Richman, and the Dade Fair
Campaign Practices Committee charged that his ``American seat''
statement could be ethnically divisive.
   While Richman said his statement meant he wants to unify the
community, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen highlighted the committee's criticism in
a TV commercial.
   In the campaign's final weekend, a Spanish-language flier went
out to Hispanics. It read: ``We, too, are Americans. No, we weren't
born in Brooklyn, New York, like him. No, we don't speak English the
same way he does.''
   Jeff Eller, spokesman for Richman, called the flier ``bald
hypocrisy,'' and the Fair Campaign Practices Committee called Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen to task Sunday, saying the brochure ``serves only to
further polarize Dade County voters.''
   Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said the state GOP put out the flier but she
didn't see anything wrong with it.
   ``I've said it in English and in Spanish _ I'm just as American
as my opponent,'' she said.
   Democrats, mindful that August is a vacation month for many
Floridians, mounted an absentee ballot drive aimed at picking up
extra votes.

<HEAD>Consumer Commission Announces Toy Recalls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toys ``R'' Us, Inc., is voluntarily recalling
9,600 ``Siren Whistle'' toys because young children might choke on
them, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday.
   The commission said neither it nor the manufacturer knows of any
injuries caused by the toy, but said the action is being taken as a
precaution.
   The whistles break apart easily and small parts could be ingested
by a child, the commission said. It said the company discovered the
problem after receiving a consumer complaint that a child sucked the
metal noisemaker from the whistle into his mouth and then coughed it
out.
   The products consist of sets of five or eight solid-color
whistles made of plastic, measuring 1 3@4 inches long. They are
identified as ``Siren Whistles'' from Lucky Star Enterprises and
Unique Industries and are manufactured in Taiwan.
   Consumers were advised to take the toys from their children and
return them to the nearest Toys ``R'' Us store.
   The commission also said that Arcotoys Inc. has announced a
voluntary recall of certain toy vehicles and the character ``Goofy''
in the company's Disney Donald's Fun Farm and Disney World Airport.
   Tests by the commission showed that wheels attached to the
vehicles' axles and Goofy's ears could separate and be swallowed,
although no injuries have been reported.
   Consumers may remove the items and return them to Arcotoys Inc.,
800 Shemes Drive, Westbury, N.Y. 11590 for an exchange with
comparable vehicles and characters.
   In the Disney Donald's Fun Farm, No. 6112, remove the four-wheel
tractor.
   In the Disney World Airport, No. 6113, remove the four-wheel
blue, yellow and red vehicles which have blue or yellow wheels; and
remove the ``Goofy'' who has long ears, a gold hat and shoes, an
orange shirt, a green vest, brown pants and white hands.
   The Fun Farm toy was imported from Hong Kong.

   A transcontinental Greyhound bus collided
with an equipment-laden flatbed truck on Interstate 10, injuring
more than 40 people, at least 10 of them seriously, state police
said today.
   No fatalities were reported, Department of Public Safety
dispatcher Jerry Stiles said. The injured included a woman five or
six months pregnant and her four children, and the bus driver, who
lost at least one leg, officials said.
   Stiles said the bus struck the rear of an 18-wheel semi-trailer
flatbed that reportedly was carrying heavy iron castings.
   The accident occurred Sunday night on a steep incline about four
miles west of Benson, which is 45 miles southeast of Tucson.
   Officials said there apparently were at least 43 ticketed
passengers aboard the bus, plus the driver, but it was unclear
whether the figure included several small children. All aboard
received at least minor injuries.
   Dr. Michael Gray, chief of staff at Benson Hospital, said
officials told him that the first several feet of the front of the
bus ``just accordioned backwards.''
   Two helicopters shuttled injured passengers from Benson Hospital
or directly from the crash site to trauma centers at two Tucson
hospitals. Ambulances carried additional passengers to the hospitals.
   Gray said 28 people were taken to the Benson emergency room.
Sixteen of them were transferred to Tucson.
   Tucson Medical Center spokesman Tom Reavis said 19 people arrived
at the hospital. Of that number, 12 remained hospitalized and two
were in critical condition, including a 2{-year-old boy who
underwent surgery for a depressed skull fracture.
   Reavis said at least five others were in guarded condition,
including the bus driver, as Jerry Henson, 49, of Phoenix, who lost
one leg.
   The others listed as guarded at Tucson Medical Center included a
1-year-old girl, an 80-year-old woman and the truck owner, James
Middleton, 58, of Houston.
   Jane Baldwin, 49, of Fresno, Calif., was listed in poor
condition; and Margo Romero, 21, of Houston, believed to be five to
six months pregnant, was listed in fair to poor condition, though
her fetus was believed to be stable.
   Two other of her small children, J.J. and Daniel, were listed in
satisfactory condition, Reavis said.
   He said another seven passengers, including a family of six, were
treated and released.
   Two of 12 passengers transported to University Medical Center
were admitted to the intensive care unit with head and internal
injuries, with another seven admitted for observation and listed in
guarded and stable condition, said spokeswoman Julietta Gonzalez.
   George Gravley, Greyhound Lines Inc. public relations director in
Dallas, said the bus was on a transcontinental run from New York to
Los Angeles and had left El Paso, Texas, at 7:15 p.m. The accident
occurred at 11:25 p.m. MST.
   He said the company had an investigative team at the scene and
acknowledged that the bus apparently had collided with the rear of
the truck.
   Stiles said the bus driver ``left about 250 feet of skid mark. He
ran into the 18-wheeler. We don't know if there was someone in the
lane to the left.''
   ``Why he ran into the 18-wheeler, why he didn't go over into the
other lane we don't know,'' Stiles added. ``We probably won't know
until we talk to him.''

   Word is out that Elizabeth Taylor has written her
memoirs, but publication details are still under wraps.
   ``Miss Taylor has in fact completed a manuscript which chronicles
her life, but there are no immediate plans for its release,''
according to a statement from Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam &amp;

   The publicist owned up to the manuscript after C. David Heymann,
author of a best-selling biography of Jacqueline Onassis, said he
soon would begin a biography of Miss Taylor. ``She might cooperate.
She hasn't given me a no yet,'' Heymann said.
   But Miss Taylor's publicist said the actress had never spoken

   The singing Jacksons, minus superstar brother
Michael, returned to their old homestead, 2300 Jackson St., the
namesake of their new album.
   It was the first time in 18 years brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine
and Randy had appeared as a group in Gary, where they began singing
25 years ago.
   ``This is where it started,'' Jackie Jackson told a crowd outside
the homestead after an appearance Saturday at a local shopping
center.
   The Jacksons knew early on what they wanted out of life, said
Gladys Bufkin Johnson, the retired principal of a school they once
attended.
   ``The teachers used to talk about Michael's refusal to learn his
numbers _ addition and subtraction _ because he said his manager was
going to take care of that,'' she said. ``He was even thinking of
success them.''

   Donny Osmond autographed one of his early
albums for a woman who said she waited 15 years for the moment, but
the singer said he's trying to shed the image of the teen-ager who
sang ``Puppy Love.''
   Osmond, 31, who has hit the charts again, said he hopes people
``wake up to the realization that 15 years have gone by'' since he
was a teen idol.
   But diehard fans like Rally Castellanos, 23, at Sunday's benefit
concert are still a thrill, Osmond said.
   ``They bring back a lot of memories that are really great to
me,'' he said. ``All the traveling I did, when you talk to people
like Rally, it all starts to come back.''
   Ms. Castellanos described the moment as ``an 8-year-old girl's
dream coming true'' after receiving a hug from Osmond.
   ``I know he's trying to change his image, and I can appreciate
that,'' she said, ``but my heart will always belong to the old

   Two of the cars landed in the repair shop and another was stolen.
   ``Thank goodness no one has been hurt,'' said Cadillac dealer
Alice DeSanders, who persists in loaning cars to visiting stars of
the Dallas Summer Musicals. ``But maybe it's a good thing the 1990
Cadillacs have air bags as standard equipment.''
   The bad luck started when Debbie Reynolds, who starred in ``The
Unsinkable Molly Brown,'' was driving her loaner and was hit by a

   The von Trapp family portrayed in the movie
``The Sound of Music'' has the hills of Montana alive with the sound
of angry sportsmen.
   The von Trapps recently bought the 50,000-acre Snowcrest Ranch,
which contains several private roads that connect public roads to
the Beaverhead National Forest, popular with hunters and fishermen.
   Johannes von Trapp, president of the family company, agreed to
leave several roads open. But he has hunters and fishermen seething
over the one he closed.
   ``They closed a road that's been open for 60 years,'' said Bill
Endy of Whitehall, a sportsman who said he has hired a lawyer.
   Von Trapp said in a statement that he wanted ``to be a good

   ``I also want to be a good land steward,'' von Trapp said. ``I
hope those who cross the Snowcrest Ranch on these roads will respect
that.''

<HEAD>Korean Memorial Planners Now Worried About Vandals, Weather</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Korean War may have been fought to contain
communist aggression, but the planners of a memorial for the
conflict's veterans are more concerned about acts by vandals,
pigeons and Mother Nature.
   It seems the planned location is a little remote and it may be
vulnerable to flooding.
   ``It's going to be way out there by itself, and the potential for
vandalism is pretty high,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Mark Coon of the
American Battle Monuments Commission.
   ``It's very tempting to go up and rub the statues and touch and
maybe break off a finger or two. One lady even wrote about pigeons
sitting on them or dropping on them,'' Coon said.
   Think building a monument is easy?
   Organizers of the $6 million project won the government's
blessing in 1986 for a spot on the Mall, near the Tidal Basin and
directly across the Reflecting Pool from the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.
   Backers of the project include President Bush and advice
columnist Abigail Van Buren.
   The design _ submitted by Pennsylvania State University
architects _ was supposed to be a secret until Bush presided over
the unveiling as a military band played patriotic songs at a White
House ceremony on Flag Day last June.
   But, in typical Washington fashion, word leaked out beforehand
that the architects contemplated statues of 38 soldiers marching
unevenly down a tree-lined path toward an American flag.
   While the design was praised by veterans' groups, the planners
face some vexing problems.
   This summer, The Washington Post published a map showing how much
of the Mall would be under water when the region gets the type of
flooding that is expected to occur every 50 years. The Korean
memorial site was in a prime flooding spot.
   ``Somebody, someday will have to be concerned about that,'' Coon
said.
   The four Penn State architects are already concerned about it,
although lately their efforts have focused more on getting their
design approved by a battery of planning and parks commissions.
   The designers were picked by a jury of Korean War veterans from
among 1,019 entrants, and they are not about to let their work be
ruined by water or vandals.
   The flood forecast represents ``a geotechnic problem that has to
be addressed. We're talking to engineers,'' said Don Leon, an
associate architecture professor who is one of the designers.
   As for vandalism, ``You address those problems by understanding
the type of materials to be used,'' Leon said.
   The group is considering making the statues out of granite.
   The commission has raised $3.5 million of the $6 million it
estimates the memorial will cost. The money must be on hand by the
time the project's legislative authority expires in October 1991 or
the collected funds are supposed to be returned, according to Coon.
   ``That's a nightmare thinking about returning all the money.
Somebody would come through before that, I'm sure,'' Coon said.
   He said an informational flyer about the memorial was sent
recently to 1.2 million recipients of Veterans Administration
checks, and that several ``Dear Abby'' advice columns about the
project had also helped generate interest.
   The designers don't expect the memorial to stir the controversy
that surrounded the Vietnam memorial, which some veterans criticized
as unheroic.
   The Vietnam memorial is a V-shaped wall bearing the names of
those killed in the war. A statue of three battle-weary soldiers
stands nearby as a concession to the critics.
   Coon said some people have questioned why the names of Korean War
veterans will not also appear on a wall at the new site.
   They were told that simply wasn't the plan.

<HEAD>Student Sentenced to Prison; Classes Resume to Different Atmosphere</HEAD>

   A student received nine years in prison for
allegedly spreading rumors to the Voice of America, a newspaper said
Monday in the first reported sentencing of a student participant in
the spring democracy movement.
   Also on Monday, former classmates of fugitive student leader
Wu'er Kaixi resumed classes at Beijing Normal University with one
week of required political study, but students said they were just
going through the motions.
   Zhang Weiping, 25, was sentenced Saturday by the Hangzhou
Intermediate People's Court for spreading counter-revolutionary
propaganda and instigating criminal acts, according to China Youth
News.
   Zhang, a senior at Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in the eastern
city of Hangzhou, admitted he called the U.S. government-funded
radio station and that he drew eight cartoons vilifying Communist
Party and government leaders, but he would not acknowledge his acts
were counterrevolutionary, the daily said.
   According to the court, on June 6, two days after the bloody
military crackdown of the student movement in Beijing, Zhang called
VOA and said students in Hangzhou had forced authorities to fly the
Chinese flag at half staff to mourn the dead in Beijing.
   It said Zhang sent a tape of the VOA broadcast of his report to
his university to be played on the school's public address system,
and ``it created a very bad political influence.''
   VOA, which has a large audience in China, has been criticized in
the official media since the crackdown for ``rumor-mongering'' in
its reports, and one of its correspondents was expelled. Chinese say
they still regard it as more reliable than their government-run
media.
   Authorities have arrested thousands of workers and students who
took part in the pro-democracy movement, and dozens of workers have
been sentenced to long prison terms for rioting and causing social
disturbances. At least 12 non-students have been executed for
destroying public property and attacking police.
   Hundreds and perhaps thousands of people were killed in the June
3-4 crackdown of the pro-democracy movement, which called for an end
to official corruption, freedom of the press and a dialogue with
government leaders.
   The government has announced the arrests of eight of the 21
student leaders on a nationwide wanted list, but so far none has
been brought to public trial. Two students on the list _ Wu'er and
Li Lu _ fled abroad, but Chinese sources say all of the remaining 19
have been arrested.
   Officials have refused to comment on such reports, including a
Hong Kong TV report over the weekend that the fourth student on the
list, Chai Ling, was arrested in Beijing.
   College students are returning to their campuses, but the
atmosphere is very different from the spring.
   Students at Beijing Normal University, where Wu'er was a freshman
last year, said they spent their first day of class Monday watching
government videotapes of what is officially called a
``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''
   The tapes, which appeared on TV this summer, glorify the
soldiers, who are said to have exercised utmost patience and
restraint when faced with ``hooligans'' pitching stones and bottles
and setting tanks on fire.
   ``We all know what really happened, though,'' said a sophomore
from Jiangsu province as he walked to an afternoon political
discussion session. He said he and his classmates would say whatever
was expected of them but made it clear no one believed any of it.
   Although none of the students spoke of renewing the protests,
they were keenly interested in the fate of the movement's leaders.
   Many asked, ``What is Wu'er Kaixi doing now?'' and ``Where are
the other escaped leaders living?'' Wu'er has been accepted to study
at Harvard University, but many others appear not to have settled
anywhere yet.
   Many also asked about Chai Ling, one of only two women on the
most-wanted list of 21 student leaders. She was at the forefront of
the students' weeklong hunger strike in May, and reportedly was one
of the last to leave Tiananmen Square on the night of the army
attack.
   Groups of students walking past the student canteen, which was
plastered with posters this spring, barely glanced at its brick
walls.
   They also ignored a large red banner hung across the campus' main
road exhorting students to ``continue the struggle against bourgeois
liberalism to the very end.''
   The TV news Monday showed more than 10,000 students from 15
schools in Shenyang, in northeastern China, hacking at overgrown
weeds Sunday. The ``voluntary labor'' was organized by the
provincial government and is part of the renewed emphasis on molding
a correct proletarian attitude.
   There are almost no students at Beijing University's campus, a
hotbed of student activism this spring. The start of classes has
been delayed until Oct. 14, partly in an attempt to prevent any
student protests on the Oct. 1 anniversary of 40 years of Communist
rule in China.

   A prosecutor said today that PTL founder
Jim Bakker lied to his followers to cheat them out of their money,
but defense lawyers said Bakker had a ``creative, religious genius''
and stands unfairly accused.
   ``The motive was dollars,'' prosecutor Jerry Miller told jurors
in opening statements at Bakker's federal court trial. ``The motive
was opulence. The motive was a lavish lifestyle most of you won't be
able to identify with.''
   As the trial opened, the leadoff prosecution witness was former
Bakker aide David Taggart, who testified that Bakker was a hands-on
administrator who worked on the ministry fund-raising programs even
on vacation.
   Taggart, who was convicted last month of committing tax evasion
during the time he was Bakker's personal assistant, said Bakker was
involved in much of the ministry's promotional activities including
fund-raising letters and brochures.
   Taggart and his brother James, who was PTL's interior decorator
and was also convicted of tax evasion, each face 25 years in prison
and $1 million in fines at a Sept. 8 sentencing. David Taggart said
he testified today because, ``I thought it might have some impact on
my sentencing in the future.''
   Bakker is being tried on 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy.
Prosecutors say he and other executives of the PTL television
ministry diverted for their own benefit at least $4 million of the
$158 million they raised for ``lifetime partnerships'' at the
ministry's resort hotels.
   In his 40-minute presentation to the jury, Miller said Bakker
``used untruth and half-truth'' to get people to send money for the
partnerships in PTL.
   ``This case is about cheating people out of their money, tricking
people out of their money by the use of the mails, telephone and
television,'' Miller said.
   Defense lawyer George T. Davis spoke an hour and 15 minutes,
saying there was no evidence that Bakker sold anything or had any
criminal intent to defraud people.
   ``We will prove that there was not a sale of one single
membership or lifetime partnership,'' Davis said. ``What happened
was gifts or donations. This was a church. This was an outreach
program.
   ``Whether you believe Jim Bakker was divinely inspired or not, he
had a divine inspiration and that was the Heritage Foundation. It
was the product of a creative, religious genius. That was Jim
Bakker's contribution to the Christian faith he believed in.''
   While Bakker was in court, his wife Tammy carried on their
television broadcast from Orlando, Fla., where the Bakkers moved
after their PTL empire collapsed.
   ``If there was any way I could be there I would be there, but we
have a program to keep on the air,'' Mrs. Bakker said, adding that
her son, Jamie Charles, started school today. ``I want Jim to have
something to come back to.''
   If convicted of all 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakker
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million.
   ``I was a pastor, and a businessman I was not,'' said Bakker in
testimony during a lawsuit last summer. Bakker, who says he is
innocent, and his attorney, Davis, have declined to discuss their
defense strategy.
   Bakker, 49, resigned from PTL in March 1987 after revelations
about his sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and a
$265,000 payoff to buy her silence. Three months after Bakker
resigned, PTL was put under bankruptcy protection.
   Outside the courthouse today, about 50 journalists and cameramen
waited, hoping to get one of the two rows of seats reserved for news
media. Other journalists signed up for one of the 28 spectator seats
in the small courtroom.
   Two men from Columbia, S.C., carried picket signs denouncing
Bakker and several other television evangelists.
   One of the pickets, Bob Eckhardt, said he and David Hallman
didn't represent a specific denomination. ``We just want people to
know God isn't playing games. Anybody who reads the Bible knew that
(PTL) wasn't right,'' Eckhardt said.
   In a sentencing hearing for former PTL Vice President Richard
Dortch last week, prosecutors gave a glimpse at their case against
Bakker.
   Dortch, Bakker's top assistant from 1984 to 1987, pleaded guilty
to four fraud and conspiracy charges in a bargain that requires him
to testify against Bakker. He was sentenced to eight years in prison
and fined $200,000.
   At Dortch's sentencing hearing, prosecutors set up large charts
showing PTL raised $158 million between 1984 and 1987 through
partnerships that promised supporters who gave $1,000 three nights
lodging per year for life in hotels being constructed at Heritage
USA, PTL's expansive retreat and park near here.
   Money was diverted to support the Bakkers' extravagant lifestyle,
the prosecutors said. During those years, Bakker and his wife,
Tammy, drew $3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks, and other
funds were used for day-to-day operations at PTL, prosecutors said.
   The government contended that nearly half of the money raised
through lifetime partnerships _ $74.2 million _ was for the Towers
Hotel project, but only $11.4 million was actually spent on the
unfinished 20-floor hotel.
   In another lifetime partnership plan, the 1100 Club, 492,000
people were offered the chance to buy partnerships and take their
choice of ``brand new'' lodgings at Farmland USA.
   According to the charts, 7,783 people bought partnerships with
donations of $1,100 each, but only one ``bunkhouse'' with 16 rooms
was built. Only eight of those rooms were designated for lifetime
partners.
   Tapes of PTL's television program, which were reviewed by a grand
jury and will be shown to Bakker's jury, show Bakker and Dortch
promising that there was a limit of 30,000 lifetime partnerships in
the Towers project.
   But government auditors said 68,755 partnerships were sold.
   ``Mr. Bakker and Mr. Dortch later told viewers of their
television show that 900 additional partnerships had opened up
because of people who had not made good on their pledges,'' Justice
Department prosecutor Deborah Smith told U.S. District Judge Robert
Potter on Thursday.
   She said that sales pitch was an example of the ``calculated
attempts'' by Bakker and Dortch to mislead their viewers and the PTL
board about the ministry's financial condition.
   ``Mr. Dortch presented himself as a religious leader and man of
God while lying to them to induce them to send in their money,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Catholic Magazine Shuts Down in Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The respected Roman Catholic periodical 30 Giorni (30
Days) said Monday it would cease publication indefinitely to protest
criticism of a group close to the monthly magazine by the Vatican's
official newspaper.
   Another magazine said it would join the protest by issuing its
next edition blank.
   The Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano on Monday criticized a recent
convention held by the conservative Italian Catholic group
Communione e Liberazione (Communion and Liberation).
   The newspaper said the convention barely dealt with religious
subjects or new ideas, and instead focused on particular political
issues. It attacked the group for criticizing the decision of the
Italian president, Francesco Cossiga, to dissolve Rome's government.
   Cossiga made the decision after Mayor Pietro Giubilo resigned in
the wake of allegations of a conflict of interest in the awarding of
contracts for school lunches. Giubilo, who denied blame in the
scandal, was a supporter of Communione e Liberazione.
   Marco Bucarelli, president of the board of directors of 30
Giorni, said the magazine was ceasing publication indefinitely as a
protest.
   ``Such a grave decision is motivated by the attempt mounted by
ideological-political factions to limit the freedom of expression
and action of Catholic lay people,'' he said.
   The magazine's staff also issued a statement in support of the
publisher's decision.
   ``For some time, and without any restraint, the directors of the
Vatican daily have taken advantage of the moral authority of the
Holy See for ideological-political maneuvers that, apart from
breaking with the glorious tradition of the paper, put serious
limitations on the freedom of opinion of the faithful,'' the
statement said.
   30 Giorni said the halt of publication applied to its Italian,
French, American, Spanish and Brazilian editions.
   Il Sabato, a weekly magazine that also is close to Communione e
Liberazione, said its edition due out Thursday would be blank to
protest the Osservatore Romano article.

   A rash of slayings, suicides and escapes
at the state penitentiary has led to the resignation of the warden
and once again focused negative attention on the Louisiana prison
system.
   Earlier this year, legislators spoke optimistically of ending
federal intervention in the prisons, begun in 1975 as a result of a
lawsuit that claimed inmates were living in squalor. But the
possibility of renewed state control seems remote now.
   Instead, U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola has demanded
step-by-step plans to move convicts out of parish jails. In
addition, he has dressed down prison officials who had criticized
his actions.
   ``Believe me, I truly don't want to be warden at any
institution,'' Polozola said at the hearing. ``I really didn't want
to go to law school to be a warden.''
   The state penitentiary at Angola has been racked by allegations
of drug dealing, lax security and low employee morale.
   The maximum security prison houses 4,800 inmates on its
18,000-acre site along the Mississippi. Because of court rulings,
the number of inmates is about the prison's intended capacity.
   In the 1950s when inmates were forced to work long hours in the
fields and housed in substandard cells, Angola was declared ``the
worst prison in America'' by one study. Conditions there contributed
to the 1971 lawsuit that led to the federal takeover.
   A 500-inmate cellblock at Angola was built several years ago but
hasn't opened because the state lacks funds to pay more guards.
   As a result of the manpower shortage at Angola and other
Louisiana prisons, 4,000 of the 16,000 inmates the state is
responsible for are being held by sheriffs in parish jails.
Officials in Orleans and Jefferson parishes have been forced to
release some accused criminals before trial because of a lack of
space.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer recently authorized $5 million to $8 million to
open the addition at Angola, and to step up construction of a new
prison in Winn Parish. Polozola, unmoved by the state's continuing
budget squeeze, has criticized the Legislature for not doing enough
to head off the problem.
   ``If the state can't do it, I will. That's not a threat. That's a
promise,'' Polozola said.
   On June 21, Polozola declared a state of emergency following four
fatal stabbings, four suicides and 11 escapes over 14 months at
Angola, and appointed former warden Ross Maggio to oversee a special
investigation.
   Maggio's Aug. 21 report said Angola was understaffed, that guards
were not properly trained to use firearms, and that prison officials
were not searching visitors or guards for drugs. He accused the
administration of lax management, saying it had not even filed
criminal charges against seven recaptured escapees.
   Two days later, Roemer asked Warden Hilton Butler to retire.
Larry Smith was appointed interim warden, becoming the
penitentiary's first black warden.
   Butler, a career corrections employee who ran the prison for 2{
years, has said the accusations against him were exaggerated, and
that conditions at the prison were similar under Maggio, his
predecessor.
   Roemer also ordered state police to re-open an investigation that
stemmed from a scandal involving former Pardon Board Chairman Howard
Marsellus Jr.
   Marsellus, who served under former Gov. Edwin Edwards, was
convicted of accepting money for pardon recommendations.

<HEAD>Sinhalese Radicals Close Down Most of Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A general strike called by Sinhalese
radicals brought nearly all businesses and transportation to a halt
in most of Sri Lanka on Monday.
   Despite government efforts to keep everything open on the first
day of the weeklong strike, witnesses said almost all shops, hotels,
offices and businesses had closed by evening in Colombo and most of
southern and central Sri Lanka, witnesses said. Those areas make up
the heartland of Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese community.
   ``You cannot even get a cup of tea today,'' said Dharmasena
Attygalle, a shipping clerk who walked to work in Colombo but found
his office closed.
   The radicals are fighting the Sinhalese-dominated government
because they believe it has granted too many concessions to ethnic
Tamil rebels and has not done enough to force a pullout of Indian
peacekeeping troops.
   Heavily armed troops patrolled Colombo in trucks with
loudspeakers, urging shop owners to open their businesses. Soldiers
broke locks on some shop doors, witnesses said.
   However, owners forced to open simply closed again when troops
left, witnesses said.
   Armed troops escorted private and state-run buses, but the main
roads were empty by evening.
   The strike was the latest in the series of work stoppages called
by the People's Liberation Front in recent weeks as part of its
violent, 2-year-old anti-government campaign that has claimed at
least 5,000 lives.
   The ultranationlist radicals are protesting what they view as
genocide by the military. The radicals say the military, armed with
emergency laws, has killed hundreds of front members.
   Opposition parties and human rights groups also accuse the
military and pro-government vigilante groups of killing civilians
suspected to be front sympathizers during a recent crackdown ordered
by President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The government denies the charge.
   The front also protests the presence of Indian peacekeeping
troops in the northeast, deployed two years ago to help end an
ethnic Tamil rebellion for an independent nation. The radicals say
the Indian presence compromises the country's independence.
   Radical posters on buildings Monday asked soldiers and policemen
to resign or face death.
   Other posters, believed to have been created by pro-government
groups, warned Sinhalese radicals their families would meet the same
fate.
   An official of the government Information Department, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said all major newspaper groups have
indicated they will not publish Tuesday's editions. The official
said few staff members arrived for work Monday.
   The latest report of violence in the radicals' campaign came
Sunday, when Sinhalese militants shot to death a soldier's parents,
brother and sister at their home near Colombo, military officials
said.
   The front launched its anti-government campaign soon after the
first Indian troops arrived on June 30, 1987, to enforce an
India-brokered peace plan to end the Tamil insurgency.
   The peace plan, which promised limited Tamil autonomy, fell apart
when the largest Tamil rebel group began attacking Indian soldiers.
   At least 11,000 people, including about 1,000 Indian soldiers,
have been killed in the 6-year-old rebel war.
   A spokesman for the Indian embassy said Monday that Indian troops
killed nine Tamil rebels since Sunday in the north and east. Three
soldiers also died in the battles, the spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, say they suffer discrimination from the Sinhalese majority.
Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   New Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu hopes to build warm
ties during his a trip to the United States this week, and he will
stress the need for both to do more to reduce their trade imbalance,
officials said Monday.
   Japanese prime ministers customarily visit Washington shortly
after taking office to establish good working relations, but Kaifu
also hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomatic
credentials and revitalize his government's foreign policy, the
officials said.
   Kaifu, who on Aug. 9 became Japan's third prime minister in less
than three months, is a former education minister with little
experience in foreign affairs. His Liberal Democratic party, which
pursues conservative policies, has been rocked by a series of money
and sex scandals that have put diplomatic initiatives on hold.
   The 58-year-old prime minister leaves Wednesday for Washington
and will later visit Mexico and Canada. He will meet Friday with
President Bush and then visit Boston, where he plans to meet with
academics and watch a Red Sox game, according to Yukio Okamoto,
director of the Foreign Ministry's First North America Division.
   Bush is expected to seek a commitment from Kaifu that Japan will
reform areas of its business and distribution system that the United
States says limit foreign access.
   Foreign Ministry officials said Kaifu will tell Bush that Japan
is willing to pursue major reform, but that the United States also
must institute changes if substantial improvement in the trade
imbalance is to be made.
   ``Japan is prepared to address her own structural issues, and
indeed we have been addressing ourselves to these problems,'' said
Mitoji Yabunaka, director of the ministry's Second North America
Division. ``But efforts should be made by both sides.''
   Yabunaka said Japan would ask the United States to boost its
savings and business investment rates, work harder to promote
exports, improve its vocational training, and seek long-term
investments rather than short-term profits.
   ``These are very serious issues, and there is no quick fix,'' he
said.
   Japan has made major reductions in tariffs and other import
barriers in recent years. U.S. and Japanese officials have begun to
say that the trade imbalance now stems mainly from social and
business structures and practices in both countries.
   The United States has said Japan's complex distribution system
and ingrown business relationships make it difficult for foreign
companies to penetrate the market, and Japan's high saving rate
reduces its purchases of foreign goods.
   Last year, Japan's trade surplus with the United States was $55
billion, according to U.S. figures.
   On other issues, Okamoto said, ``Mr. Kaifu will be making clear
to the president that there will be no change whatsoever in our
basic position in our foreign policy.''
   In addition to forming a working relationship with U.S.
officials, Kaifu plans to reach out to the American public, he said.
   ``We expect Mr. Kaifu's personal traits _ young, energetic,
accessible, a caring personality _ will be well received by our
American friends,'' he said.
   Kaifu's will visit Mexico Sept. 4-6. The newspaper Yomiuri
Shimbun reported Monday that Kaifu will offer Mexican officials a $1
billion loan to help combat air pollution in Mexico City.
   Kaifu is to meet with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada in
Ottawa on Sept. 7, Okamoto said.

   A medical helicopter crashed in northern
Idaho while taking an injured criminal suspect to a hospital,
killing at least two persons, authorities said today.
   There were indications that the man, wounded in a Canadian border
shootout, scuffled with the helicopter's three-person crew before
the craft disappeared Sunday evening, and authorities said they were
treating the crash as a crime.
   Rescuers found two bodies in the wreckage of the helicopter where
it crashed in a mountainous region and were looking for the other
two people, said Kootenai County, Idaho, Sheriff's Sgt. Kenneth
Sopher. The helicopter had been en route to Sacred Heart Medical
Center in Spokane.
   ``The circumstances of the mishap ... definitely indicate that
it's not an aircraft accident,'' said Pete Mangum, an air safety
inspector with the National Transportation Safety Board in Seattle.
``The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident
as a criminal activity other than an aircraft accident.''
   He declined to specify what evidence led authorities to believe a
crime had caused the crash, but a man who was monitoring radio
messages Sunday evening said the crew apparently radioed shortly
before the crash that they were having trouble with the wounded
suspect.
   The helicopter, an Aerospatiale Astar, also carried its pilot, a
nurse and a respiratory therapist, according to Marilyn Thordarson,
a spokeswoman for the hospital.
   The wreckage was spotted at about 10 a.m. near Spirit Mountain,
about two miles south of Blanchard Lake near the Washington-Idaho
border, Sopher saod.
   The copter was believed to be one of two that were dispatched to
Bonners Ferry, Idaho, to pick up two people wounded in the shooting,
which occurred after a man wanted by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police forced his way into the United States from Canada at gunpoint.
   One helicopter picked up a wounded 71-year-old man and returned
to Spokane safely. The second copter left Bonners Ferry about 9:30
p.m. and disappeared about a half-hour later.
   Bob Zinkgraf, a resident of Colbert, about 15 miles north of
Spokane, said he was listening to a radio scanner when he overheard
what he believed was a report of a scuffle aboard the helicopter
shortly before 10 p.m.
   ``They reported they were having problems with the suspect,'' he
said. ``A couple of minutes minutes later, they reported they were
in a scuffle with the suspect.''
   Zinkgraf said he heard the hospital reporting that it had lost
contact with the helicopter a short time later, at about 10 p.m.
   Ms. Thordarson said she knew of no reports of difficulty from the
helicopter crew, only that it made a routine patient status report
shortly before radio contact became garbled and then was lost
altogether.
   Identities of those on board were not immediately released, but
authorities said the patient aboard the missing helicopter was
apparently the man sought by police for questioning about an
incident at the U.S. Customs Station at Eastport, Idaho.
   The border incident began Sunday about 7:30 p.m., during the
search of a vehicle of a man entering the U.S. from Canada, said
Cherise Miles, a U.S. Customs spokeswoman in Chicago.
   During a ``secondary'' inspection, the man pulled a gun and
disarmed Port Director Joe Hancock, then fled south on U.S Highway
95, said Ms. Miles. Hancock was not injured, she said.
   A short time later, a man approached the home of an elderly
couple about a mile south of the crossing station and forced his way
in, she said. A woman fled the house and called police, who later
found two wounded men, Ms. Miles said.
   She wouldn't give the name of the elderly couple, but the
hospital identified the injured man in the helicopter that arrived
safely as Bob McGlocklin, 71. He was reported in satisfactory
condition with gunshot wounds in his arm and back.

<HEAD>State Department Opposes PLO Membership In World Tourism Organization</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department flatly opposed on Monday
any form of membership by the Palestine Liberation Organization in a
world tourism group as contrary to international law and the cause
of peace.
   It was not clear, however, that U.S. opposition would derail the
move under discussion at a meeting of the World Tourism Organization
in Paris since the United States does not have veto power.
   On the other hand, the Bush administration could discourage the
move if it chose to withhold financial support. The United States,
which covers 4 percent to 5 percent of the organization's budget, is
contributing $330,000 this year.
   The PLO, with which the administration is discussing Mideast
peace prospects, applied for membership on July 7 for ``Palestine.''
All Arab countries recognize Yasser Arafat's groups as the sole,
legitimiate representative of Palestinian Arabs and many other
countries have permitted the PLO to open quasi-embassies.
   The United States enhanced PLO prestige last December by opening
a dialogue that the Bush administration has continued despite an
evident lack of progress in promoting Arab-Israeli negotiations. On
the other hand, all U.S. administrations, as a matter of policy,
have been opposed to establishment of a Palestinian state on land
held by Israel.
   Asked about the PLO's latest push for acceptance, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher declared: ``The U.S. is opposed
to admitting the PLO, or, quote, Palestine, unquote, to the World
Tourism Organization. In our view, the self-declared state of
Palestine, which we do not recognize, does not meet the generally
accepted criteria under international law for statehood, and thus
does not qualify for membership in international organizations.''
   ``Nor,'' Boucher said, ``do we believe that bestowing legitimacy
upon the self-proclaimed, quote, state, would advance the efforts to
promote peace in the Middle East. We're convinced that the final
status of the occupied territories can be determined only through
negotiations, not through unilateral acts that prejudge the outcome
of such negotiations. The declaration of Palestinian statehood was
such a unilateral act.''
   Boucher said the administration had made its views known to the
World Tourism Organization and ``we are consulting closely with
like-minded friends on how best to block these PLO efforts, which we
will continue to oppose vigorously.''

   The peace conference on Cambodia began its final
session Monday with less than three days to resolve deep-seated
differences that have frustrated nearly a month of negotiations.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas opened the session, which foreign
ministers were asked to attend, and urged the 19 national
delegations to accept compromise in the five major areas of
disagreement.
   ``I appeal to each of you to make this possible,'' Dumas said.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Qian Quichen, foreign ministers of the
Soviet Union and China, were absent because of lack of progress at
the conference, their governments announced. Washington said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III also chose not to return
because no comprehensive solution was in sight.
   The first conference of all parties involved in Cambodia had
raised hopes when it began in late July, with all 19 foreign
ministers attending and the chairmaship shared by France and
Indonesia. It was intended to lay the groundwork for lasting peace
in Cambodia after two decades of war.
   Monday's meeting lasted 3{ hours, mostly in closed session.
Delegates said efforts for a compromise would continue over dinner
and in informal groups after that.
   Dumas said national reconciliation was the ``essential issue'' of
disagreement ``that no doubt will determine all the rest.''
   The main protagonists, the Vietnamese-sponsored government of
Premier Hun Sen and the three-party rebel alliance led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, have scarcely changed their positions during three
weeks of efforts by working committees.
   Conference sources said the factions reiterated those positions
Monday and Hun Sen proposed a mission to gather information both on
Vietnamese and Chinese settlers in Cambodia and conditions at Khmer
Rouge refugee camps in Thailand.
   Sihanouk claims up to 1 million Vietnamese ``colonizers'' have
settled in Cambodia during Vietnam's decade of occupation, and
demands they be removed with Vietnamese soldiers who withdraw next
month.
   The prince, Cambodia's ruler until 1970, said he was ``prepared
to agree with that which the majority of the conference wants,'' a
source close to the conference quoted him as saying.
   In what capacity the prince spoke was not completely clear. He
resigned over the weekend as president of his party, cited internal
disputes, but kept the leadership of the rebel alliance.
   At the center of the conflict is the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
rebel faction, which controlled Cambodia for nearly four years until
the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978 and is blamed for hundreds
of thousands of deaths.
   Sihanouk has insisted the Khmer Rouge be included in a
transitional government before general elections. A conference
source said Hun Sen, in a speech at the beginning of the closed
session, rejected the proposal once again.
   Dumas, the French foreign minister, said the other areas of
disagreement were the U.N. role in monitoring the Vietnamese
withdrawal and a cease-fire, organization of a cease-fire, use of
the word ``genocide'' in a conference text and the alleged
Vietnamese settlers.
   Leaders pf the Khmer Rouge have refused to accept the word
``genocide,'' which Vietnam and the Hun Sen government use to
describe the Khmer Rouge reign, in conference texts. Hun Sen insists
it be used.
   Vietnam says it will withdraw the last of its forces by Sept. 27,
with or without a settlement.
   There has been speculation the conference might continue at some
later date if it does not achieve a comprehensive solution by the
Wednesday deadline. An immediate consequence of no agreement would
be a lack of arrangements for monitoring the Vietnamese withdrawal.
   ``After 20 years of bloodshed and horrors in Cambodia, you'd have
to be a brave person to be optimistic,'' a member of the Canadian
delegation said. Canada is co-chairman of the committee trying to
establish an international control mechanism.
   The delegate, speaking privately, said his committee's document
was ``about 12 pages'' long after three weeks of work, but contained
``about 16 pages'' of amendments covering points of disagreement
among delegates.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $27.7
billion from April through June, the best showing in more than four
years, as a record level of exports overcame a big surge in
America's foreign oil bill, the government reported Monday.
   The Commerce Department said that the 2.3 percent drop in the
trade deficit during the second quarter marked the second
consecutive quarterly decline. The deficit had fallen an even
sharper 11.4 percent in the first three months of the year to $28.38
billion.
   The April-June improvement came from a 3.4 percent increase in
exports, which climbed to an all-time high of $90.87 billion. This
more than offset a 2 percent rise in imports, which also set a
record at $118.58 billion.
   Many analysts are concerned that the rapid growth in exports,
which provided much of the momentum for overall economic activity
last year, has already begun to slow under the impact of a rise in
the value of the dollar.
   A stronger dollar makes American goods less competitive on
overseas markets while making imports cheaper in the United States.
   Rising demand for imported oil is also expected to make the
deficit worsen in the second half of the year. While non-oil imports
actually fell in the second quarter, oil imports shot up by 23.8
percent.
   ``This is the end of the good news on trade,'' said Michael
Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. He and other analysts
predicted the deficit would widen slightly in coming months.
   ``With the dollar having risen so much in the last 18 months,
export growth has slowed while import growth remains fairly
strong,'' said David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill.
   For the first six months of the year, the trade deficit is
running at an annual rate of $112.2 billion, down almost 12 percent
from the 1988 deficit of $127.2 billion.
   Evans said he expected the deficit would show only a marginal
improvement for the whole year and he predicted the trade balance
would actually begin to rise again in 1990 as the dollar's increase
eats further into export growth.
   Monday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance
of payment basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the
Commerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports.
   The totals from the two reports vary slightly because the balance
of payments report exludes military sales by the U.S. government and
makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures.
   The $27.7 billion deficit in the April-June quarter was the
lowest quarterly imbalance since a $25.7 billion deficit in the
first three months of 1985.
   The lower-than-expected trade deficit for the second quarter,
along with stronger consumer spending, should prompt an upward
revision in the estimate of overall economic growth when it is
released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, many analysts said.
   In advance of the report, many economists were predicting the
gross national product would be revised from a lackluster 1.7
percent annual rate in the second quarter to a more respectable 2.7
percent rate, further easing fears that the economy is in danger of
toppling into a recession this year.
   The second quarter trade improvement was propelled by a 3.9
percent rise in non-farm exports, which climbed to a record $80.1
billion. This gain reflected widespread increases in a variety of
merchandise categories. Exports of airplanes jumped 12 percent while
computer sales were up 5 percent and consumer exports rose 7.3
percent.
   The increase in imports occurred because of the $2.6 billion rise
in petroleum imports, which climbed to $13.4 billion, reflecting
both higher prices and an increase in volume. Non-oil imports edged
down 0.3 percent to $105.2 billion.
   The price per barrel of oil rose to $18.46, up 18.8 percent from
the first quarter, while the volume climbed to 7.97 million barrels
a day, up 4.1 percent from the previous quarter.
   Evans said with domestic production declining and energy demands
growing, America's foreign oil bill is headed even higher. He noted
that oil imports in July, which were not reflected in this report,
supplied more than 50 percent of domestic needs, the first time that
has occurred in 12 years.
   Sales of U.S. farm products slipped a tiny 0.3 percent to $10.7
billion with part of the decline reflected in a $500 million drop in
wheat sales to the Soviet Union. Soybean sales fell by $200 mllion,
primarily because of a cutback in shipments to Western Europe, while
tobacco exports were down $200 million because of a drop in
shipments to Japan.
   The average price of soybeans fell 4 percent while cotton prices
were down 3 percent and corn prices declined 2 percent. Wheat prices
were up 2 percent on average.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was run up with Japan, an imbalance
of $12.2 billion, a full 44 percent of the total deficit.

<HEAD>Kohl Gets Party Backing Despite Falling Public Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday
emerged as the sole contender for leadership of his Christian
Democratic Union as the governing party heads into the 1990 national
election campaign.
   The party's support, tendered in a closed-door meeting, is a
much-needed boost for the chancellor, who has suffered a drop in
popularity among voters.
   But the apparent decision to retain Kohl as party leader and
therefore its candidate for chancellor next year could disappoint
the majority of West German voters who want a change from the status
quo.
   A public opinion poll released over the weekend by the respected
Emnid research firm indicated 71 percent of West German voters
questioned want an alternative to Kohl as chancellor, including 59
percent of the respondents claiming allegiance to Kohl's party.
   Political observers had speculated that more popular members of
the party might come forward to challenge Kohl as the party heads
into a tough re-election fight.
   Kohl declined to talk with reporters after the three-hour
meeting, but a participant, Rhineland-Palatinate governor
Carl-Ludwig Wagner, said Kohl emerged as the sole candidate for
party leadership.
   The party will hold its national convention in Bremen in less
than two weeks, at which another chancellor candidate could emerge.
But Monday's decision appeared to indicate the party will stick with
Kohl.
   The Christian Democratic Union has been damaged by controversies
such as U.S. accusations that West German firms helped Libya build a
chemical weapons plant, and Bonn's refusal to endorse a NATO plan to
extend the range of nuclear missiles based in West Germany.
   Amid those crises, the party suffered some serious election
setbacks this year, losing control of important cities like Berlin
and Frankfurt.
   Kohl and his party recovered some voter confidence this summer
following the May 29-30 NATO summit, at which the missile debate was
resolved, and the high-profile visit by President Bush immediately
after.
   But the Emnid poll, commissioned by the weekly news magazine Der
Spiegel, indicated further damage has been caused by a dispute over
Kohl's firing of long-time party manager Heiner Geissler.
   Geissler has had a moderating influence on the party in recent
years, moving it toward the ideological center as the West German
electorate became more concerned with social security issues and the
environment.
   The poll of 1,000 voters showed 38 percent support the Christian
Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social
Union, and an equal 38 percent favor the left-leaning Social
Democratic Party.
   With neither of the two main political parties polling a
majority, a coalition with one of the smaller parties would be
necessary to win control of the federal government in the 1990
balloting.

   Mourners filled a church today to remember
Huey P. Newton as he lived, not as he died.
   All 1,200 seats of the Allen Temple Baptist Church were taken for
the funeral of the Black Panther Party co-founder, who was shot to
death in what police allege was a dispute over crack cocaine.
Hundreds more people milled about outside the building.
   ``We're here to celebrate his life, not to discuss his death,''
said Elaine Brown, head of the Panthers from 1974 to 1977 and now a
writer living in Southern California. ``We don't need
counter-revolutionary fratricide. He'll be remembered as a hero.''
   ``I just think it is very important for me to be here,'' said the
Rev. Y. Stevens of the Third Baptist Church in San Francisco. ``He
has been an inspiration to the young black people. Somewhere along
the line he may have fallen, but in the early days I admired his
mission.''
   Church officials said the service would feature a lengthy list of
speakers, including H. Rap Brown, leader of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, and Bobby Seale, who joined with Newton to
establish the Panthers in 1966.
   On Sunday, a wake for Newton drew 6,000 mourners in a rare public
show of support for the ``black power'' politics he espoused in the
'60s.
   ``This here is for those who really meant a lot to Huey; the
people who needed him the most, the everyday people from the
streets,'' said Hillary Jones, standing in line Sunday as people
filed through a mortuary two at a time to view his body.
   ``This kind of turnout for what Huey once stood for hasn't been
seen in a long time around here,'' added Jones, 48, who described
herself as a sympathizer with politics of the Black Panther Party,
which dissolved in the mid '70s.
   Also today, a self-proclaimed prison gang member and drug dealer
who police say admitted killing Newton faced arraignment on a
homicide charge in Alameda County Municipal Court.
   Mourners on Sunday lined up for three blocks outside the funeral
home in a rundown section of east Oakland.
   ``This is a terrible tragedy for blacks. He stood for black pride
in the '60s and now he stands for the decimation of blacks by
crack,'' said LeRoy Johnson, 44, as he waited to attend the daylong
wake.
   Newton, 47, was shot to death Tuesday in what police said was a
dispute over crack cocaine in the drug-ridden west Oakland
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years ago.
   He founded the Black Panther Party with Bobby Seale in 1966, and
as its minister of defense became one of the most articulate leaders
of the black militancy movement. The party dissolved in the mid-70s.
   ``He made us have black pride,'' said Norma Corman, 38, who knew
Newton casually for the last decade. ``He was a good man destroyed
by the badness of drugs.''
   However, many in line at the funeral home said they didn't
believe the police account of Newton's death and blamed it on
authorities.
   ``The police were always after Huey,'' said Jeffrey deLeong, 28.
``The Man got him.''
   A television cameraman taping interviews with mourners was
attacked by a group of men who had warned him earlier that they
didn't want their pictures taken, police and KTVU-Channel 2
officials said.
   Cameraman Henry Faybusovic suffered cuts and scrapes and was
being X-rayed for internal injuries at Highland Hospital, said
police Sgt. C. Vierra.
   Police said Tyrone Robinson, a 25-year-old member of the Black
Guerrilla Family, admitted shooting Newton in self-defense after
Newton brandished a gun and demanded crack shortly before dawn
Tuesday. Newton had a history of drug and alcohol abuse.
   Police have disputed the ex-convict's account, instead believing
the killing was an attempt by Robinson to make a name for himself in
the notorious gang. Police said Newton had stolen drugs and money
from the gang in recent years.
   Newton's family has declined to comment since the police
announcement Friday of Robinson's arrest 14 hours after the slaying.
   The Black Guerrilla Family was founded in the prisons in the
1960s by inmate George Jackson, a Black Panther who died in a
notorious escape attempt at San Quentin prison in 1971.

   Colombian Justice Minister Monica de Greiff
came to the Justice Department under tight security today for a
meeting with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh about the war against
her country's drug lords.
   Mrs. de Greiff arrived in an unmarked official car that drove
into the Justice Department's underground parking garage. The
32-year-old jurist was in Washington for meetings with Bush
administration officials about fighting the war against the
Colombian cocaine cartel.
   There were also tentative plans for her to meet with State
Department officials later in the day, according to U.S. officials.
   Administration officials denied reports that Mrs. de Greiff had
resigned in the face of death threats from the leaders of the
Medellin cocaine cartel.
   White House spokesman Roman Papadiuk said the president of
Colombia, Virgilio Barco, has denied reports that Mrs. de Greiff had
resigned in the face of death threats from drug lords, and his
``words are good enough for me.''
   Papadiuk, speaking to reporters in Kennebunkport, Maine, where
President Bush is vacationing, said Mrs. de Greiff planned to
discuss efforts to break the drug cartels in Colombia with officials
of the State and Justice departments and extraditing drug lords
wanted by U.S. authorities to this country.
   U.S. officials said there were tentative plans for Mrs. de Greiff
to have an afternoon meeting with senior State Department officials,
including Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt.
   The time and place were not disclosed.
   U.S. officials said they had heard unconfirmed reports that Mrs.
de Greiff's 3-year-old son, who accompanied her here from Bogota,
was the target of a death threat.
   According to the officials, who asked not to be identified, Mrs.
de Greiff's place of residence during her stay here was being kept
secret for security reasons.
   Thornburgh said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' that efforts
to extradite Eduardo Martinez Romero, the most prominent alleged
Colombian drug figure arrested in recent government sweeps against
the cartel, are proceeding and ``we expect to have him delivered to
U.S. authorities this week.''
   Martinez reputedly is involved in the Colombian cartel's money
laundering operation, but was not one of a dozen Colombian drug
traffickers included in a U.S. ``most wanted'' list sent to Colombia
last week.
   The three men at the top of the U.S. list are Pablo Escobar,
Jorge Ochoa and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha. All have evaded the
government crackdown and are believed to be in hiding.
   Thornburgh also said unconfirmed sightings of some of Colombia's
drug cartel kingpins have been reported, but he suggested there is
little to indicate any of them will be captured soon.
   ``As in most fugitive situations, there are sightings of these
figures, but they're very clever, they're well financed,''
Thornburgh said.
   Meanwhile, William Bennett, President Bush's drug czar, said the
Colombian drug operation has been severely disrupted even if the top
kingpins have eluded capture.
   ``These guys need to feel the heat,'' Bennett said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press'' interview show.
   President Bush last week announced plans for a $64 million
military aid package to Colombia that ncludes the use of U.S.
military advisers and equipment.

<HEAD>Former Congressman Sentenced to Year in Prison for Lying to Grand
Jury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall was sentenced to a
year in prison and fined $30,000 Monday for lying to a federal grand
jury about an $850,000 money-laundering scheme and again declared he
is an innocent man.
   The 38-year-old Republican, who served two terms before his
defeat last November, was convicted June 20 of nine counts of
perjury for his testimony in 1988 about negotiations with a federal
agent posing as a drug-money launderer.
   Federal guidelines called for up to 11 years in prison. The fine
imposed by U.S. District Judge Richard C. Freeman was the maximum
under the guidelines.
   Swindall, who won election from Atlanta's eastern suburbs in 1984
but lost while under indictment four years later, remains free on
appeal. Prosecutors said that under the guidelines, he will serve
the entire sentence.
   ``The problem I have is not the length of the sentence, but
whether it should have been imposed at all,'' he said after the
sentencing.
   In a 30-minute statement to the judge, Swindall cited why he
believes he was unfairly convicted. But an irritated judge told the
former congressman he would not ``rehash the evidence'' or ``turn
this thing into a circus.''
   Swindall told him, ``I stand before you in all humility,'' but
Freeman retorted: ``You don't know the meaning of humility, Mr.
Swindall.''
   U.S. Attorney Robert Barr said afterward, ``We thought a more
lengthy sentence was called for.''
   The prosecution had requested sentencing under guidelines calling
for up to about four years on each count for lying about a crime.
But the judge refused because the government never accused Swindall
of actually laundering any money.
   Freeman agreed to recommend that Swindall be sent to the
minimum-security prison in Atlanta.
   Evidence at Swindall's trial included tapes of conversations with
an IRS undercover agent and a political supporter, Charles
LeChasney, who has since pleaded guilty to money laundering
conspiracy. A witness also testified the congressman-lawyer boasted
he could beat a perjury rap because he had given properly vague
answers.
   Swindall had sought $850,000 to finish his luxurious home. He
accepted a $150,000 check before backing out of the deal.
   The jury found Swindall guilty of telling 18 deliberate lies in
his grand jury testimony about the deal. He claimed he was tired and
his memory faulty.
   Swindall is appealing his conviction, contending that the judge
improperly struck the testimony of a congressional colleague and
that the prosecution improperly questioned a witness about why some
defendants don't testify, as Swindall declined to do.
   On Monday, Swindall's brother Kevin told the judge the
ex-congressman had not testified at his trial because he ``didn't
want the jury poisoned'' by the revelation of unsavory details of a
feud with his father over family business.
   Swindall was largely a political unknown before he was elected to
Congress in 1984, upsetting Democrat Elliott Levitas. He was
re-elected in 1986 but lost in 1988 to Democrat Ben Jones while
under the cloud of his perjury indictment.
   LeChasney, who testified against Swindall, awaits sentencing on
his own conviction.

<HEAD>Six Blacks Killed in Attacks Near Pietermaritzburg</HEAD>

   Six blacks were killed in
attacks near the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, the site of
black factional fighting that has claimed almost 2,000 lives in
three years, police said Monday.
   Also on Monday, organizers of a defiance campaign in the capital
of Pretoria said their homes were attacked with gunfire and gasoline
bombs. Other activists said they received death threats from a
shadowy white supremacist group.
   In Pietermaritzburg, police said three men were fatally shot in
the Imbali township, including two who were leaving a peace rally
held by a youth group.
   In the nearby Mpumalanga township, police found two charred
bodies and also reported a man was shot and killed in a clash
between two unidentified groups. The police unrest report, which
covers incidents from the previous 24 hours, provided no additional
details.
   The main combatants in Pietermaritzburg are the banned United
Democratic Front, the country's largest anti-apartheid coalition,
and Inkatha, a political organization headed by Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but the Front favors
confrontational tactics such as protests, boycotts, sanctions and
strikes that Inkatha does not endorse.
   The Front has been leading a mass defiance campaign that was
launched Aug. 2 to oppose segregated hospitals, schools, buses,
beaches and other facilities.
   In Pretoria, blacks attempted to board ``whites-only'' buses
Monday but three were arrested and the rest were turned away,
organizers said. Police said those arrested would be charged with
conspiracy.
   In several cases, bus drivers encountering black passengers at
white bus stops simply drove past, refusing to pick up white
passengers as well.
   Two white organizers of the bus defiance campaign said shots were
fired into their homes Sunday night, but no one was injured. Another
activist said the front-door of his home was set alight and a fourth
said her car was petrol bombed outside her house.
   Other activists reported receiving deaths threats from a white
supremacist group called the White Wolves. Police say they have no
evidence the organization exists, but people who say they belong
have claimed responsibility for attacks and threats against blacks
and white anti-apartheid campaigners.
   In the four southern cities, thousands of black students
attempted to march from their campuses to whites-only public
schools, but were stopped by police in all but one instance.
   The exception was in Queenstown where police allowed a delegation
of 20 students and teachers to meet with the headmaster of a white
high school and demand integrated schools.
   In other developments:
   _ Cape Town police detained Trevor Manuel, a prominent United
Democratic Front leader, his family said. Also detained was Bulelani
Ngcuka, assistant secretary of the National Association of
Democratic Lawyers, witnesses said.
   _ Veteran anti-apartheid campaigner Rev. Beyers Naude asked the
United States to exert pressure on the South African government to
lift restrictions on activists.
   Naude, who met with President Bush in May, said the U.S. consul
general in Johannesburg, Peter Chaveas, agreed to pass on the
request but did not promise any specific action.
   Hundreds of activsts released from detention are under
restrictions that limit their movements and bar them from
anti-government political activity.

   South African leader F.W. de Klerk
outlined his plans for racial reconciliation at a historic summit
Monday with one of his government's most outspoken and influential
opponents, President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia.
   The meeting at a resort hotel near Victoria Falls was the first
state visit by a South African leader to Zambia, which accommodates
the headquarters of the African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   De Klerk's predecessor, President P.W. Botha, initiated a
campaign last year to improve white-run South Africa's relations
with its black neighbors. But Botha resigned Aug. 14 after the
Cabinet overruled his argument that de Klerk not visit Zambia
because of its support for the ANC.
   De Klerk stressed that his government opposed any outside
interference in domestic politics, but briefed Kaunda on his
proposals to end South Africa's black-white conflict.
   ``I had the opportunity to give a positive vision of the future
in which South Africa is going to break out of the cycle of
conflict,'' De Klerk told reporters. ``We are going through
negotiations and dialogue.''
   Kaunda said he would have to confer with other African heads of
state before responding to several points raised in the talks.
   Asked about de Klerk's proposals, Kaunda replied: ``There are
certain basic principles which he says he intends to implement.
About those, I see no disagreement at all.''
   De Klerk said of Kaunda: ``I got the impression he listened very
carefully. His reaction was a positive one, but also a wait-and-see
one.''
   Neither leader disclosed specifics of what de Klerk said. In
recent speeches, he has proposed a five-year plan aimed at bringing
the black majority into the political system while preventing white
interests from being overruled.
   Kaunda has led Zamibia since its independence from Britain in
1964 and is chairman of the Frontline States, a six-nation group
formed to work collectively against the South African government.
   He recently warned of a ``major, violent explosion'' if the ANC
and South Africa's white leaders failed to open talks.
   The ANC has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign in South Africa
since 1961 as part of a campaign to end white-minority control.
   South Africa's far-right Conservative Party claimed Kaunda would
in effect meet de Klerk as a mediator for the ANC, presenting its
latest proposal for talks aimed at bringing about majority rule.
   De Klerk said the proposal was not discussed, and Kaunda said:
``I wasn't speaking for the ANC.''
   Kaunda led a delegation of about 100 in a low-key welcome for de
Klerk at Livingstone's airport. There was a red carpet, but no guard
of honor, no band and no South African flag.
   Both leaders described the talks as ``useful'' and welcomed the
opportunity to get acquainted. De Klerk, on the flight back to South
Africa, said he found Kaunda ``a pleasant man, an earnest Christian.
... He's concerned that we move toward cooperation.''
   De Klerk, leader of the governing National Party, is favored to
win a five-year term as president after parliamentary elections
Sept. 6.
   He has tried to portray himself as a statesman capable of ending
South Africa's international isolation while at the same insisting
the ANC renounce violence before being included in negotiations.
   In their talks, De Klerk and Kaunda discussed the breakdown of a
cease-fire intended to end Angola's 14-year civil war and the
independence process in Namibia, the territory South Africa has
ruled for 74 years.
   De Klerk said they agreed the year-long independence plan was on
track with elections scheduled for early November.
   On Sunday, De Klerk met with Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi. Afterward, Savimbi said his U.S.-backed National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola _ UNITA _ remains committed to
peace in Angola. He promised to attend a summit in Zaire next month
to try to salvage the cease-fire.
   In Washington, the State Department said: ``We welcome statements
from UNITA that it is prepared to observe the cease-fire. As we've
stated before, we urge both sides to conclude negotiations on a
comprehensive and effective cease-fire agreement. Such an agreement
would open the way to negotiations on political issues and national
reconciliation.''
   The UNITA leader was angered by a claim by Kaunda last week that
Savimbi had agreed to retire from politics and that the rebels would
accept Angola's current one-party constitution. These points were
raised by the South African delegation with Kaunda.
   South Africa ended its aid to Savimbi under terms of a regional
peace treaty signed in December with Angola. The pact calls for a
phased withdrawal of Cuba's 50,000 soldiers from Angola.

   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan said all NFL players had
been given ample notice earlier this year that they would face
discipline for using the strength-enhancing substances.
   Hogan refused to issue a temporary restraining order and said the
players' labor union had not shown that its members would face
irreparable harm under the league's suspension plan.
   The players association filed a motion for a temporary
restraining order earlier today, calling the testing procedures
``highly questionable'' in terms of accuracy. The labor union's
lawyers said they were considering whether to take further legal
action and asked the NFL to voluntarily suspend its plan to disclose
the names of players testing positive and suspend them for 30 days.
   Identifying and suspending players under the program will result
in their being ``permanently stigmatized,'' the association said in
court papers. ``Their professional reputations will be irreparably
harmed and injured.''
   The union said ``publicly announced player-suspensions are
imminent'' for those who test positive for steroids or chemicals
designed to mask the presence of the substances.
   The NFL's plans called for announcing today a list of those who
tested positive.
   ``This automatic sanction is to be imposed in the absence of
essential `baseline data,' which provides the only sound basis for
determining whether measured levels of steroids actually reflect
steroid use, as opposed to naturally occurring levels of the
hormones detected,'' said the players organization's court papers.
   The players have filed a grievance challenging the steroid
program and the matter is in arbitration.
   Despite the pending arbitration, the league ``has apparently
refused to refrain from proceeding with its plans to announce the
suspension of numerous players for a minimum of 30 days, one-fourth
of the NFL season,'' said the players' court filings.
   Before the 1987 season, 1,600 players were tested for steroids
and 6 percent were found to be users. The same number of players was
tested before the 1988 season, and although final results are not
due until next month, the NFL said the 6 percent usage figure was so
far what the league had found.

<HEAD>Mazowiecki to Present Government in September</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki met with
coalition leaders Monday about forming the East bloc's first
non-communist government, but a Solidarity deputy said a new Cabinet
could not be presented until September.
   Also Monday, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said he plans to
appeal to workers for a moratorium on strikes to give the new
government time to solve Poland's pressing problems.
   ``There are no major obstacles or difficulties in forming the
government, only there is a certain inevitable slow process,'' said
Bronislaw Geremek, the Solidarity parliamentary floor leader.
   Mazowiecki, elected the first non-communist government leader in
the East bloc in more than 40 years on Thursday, had said he would
like to present the government to the Sejm by the end of August.
   ``The prime minister did not realize this inevitable slowness
when he gave the date of Aug. 31, and he cannot keep that promise.
We think the government could be presented to the Sejm before Sept.
10,'' Geremek said.
   Geremek and other members of the Solidarity parliamentary group
met with Mazowiecki for two hours Monday. The prime minister also
received separately the parliamentary and party leaders of the
Democratic and Peasant Parties.
   The independent Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said Monday that Walesa
would issue a statement in the coming days about the need for strike
moratorium of at least a six months.
   Walesa has said that labor peace and Western aid are necessary to
help reverse Poland's economic decline and provide a favorable
climate for the new government.
   Asked in Gdansk on Monday when the moratorium request would be
issued, Walesa replied: ``We should do it together with the
appointment of the (whole) government.''
   ``We have the biggest chance ever to make the Poland of our
dreams. We can go in this direction but we cannot do it if we are
going to suffer economic losses,'' he said.
   Walesa will appeal to workers not to strike and said Solidarity
would help them in the meantime to negotiate with management, Gazeta
Wyborcza said.
   Pay disputes have broken out on an almost daily basis in the
country in the past six months, but most of the work stoppages have
been brief.
   Workers are frustrated by soaring inflation, empty shelves and
stores with poor quality goods, as well as by the lack of visible
economic improvements since Solidarity was legalized in April after
a seven-year ban and Poland's freest elections in more than four
decades were held in June.
   Geremek said the parliamentary group discussed its relationship
with the prime minister, the government's economic program and the
distribution of ministries.
   Drafting an economic plan is the most difficult problem the
government faces, he said.
   ``A sketch of the economic program emerged during the electoral
campaign. Now is not the time to define the direction of the
program, but to define the strategy, in particular a choice between
a step-by-step approach and a big bang,'' he said.
   ``We have the impression now that a policy of radical (economic)
change is necessary. ... From the start this government must see the
need to give some signs of improvement in the short term,'' he said.
   Geremek said the improvement must concern supplying goods to
major cities and that the government must also find a way to stop
inflation, which has reached three digits.
   The Communist Party has been promised the key ministries of
defense and the interior which control the army and the police, and
Geremek indicated that the communists may be asked to take an
economic ministry as well.
   ``To give them the ministries of the interior and the army and no
economic ministry would be a big mistake. They would have all the
power and no responsibility,'' he said.
   The Solidarity group also told Mazowiecki it was important to
diminish the Communist Party's monopoly over mass media,
particularly radio and television.
   Until now, state radio and television were administered by a
state-run committee whose chairman held the rank of minister.
Geremek suggested the new head of radio and television could be
someone who is not a member of the government.
   ``There is no place in the government for a minister of
information,'' he said.
   As part of the agreements that led to Solidarity's legalization
and the election, the indpendent movement was granted permission to
publish a daily and weekly newspaper. It also has limited access to
state TV and radio.

<HEAD>Japanese Catch Chinese Posing as Vietnamese Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese authorities said Monday they detained two
Chinese refugees posing as Vietnamese boat people and launched a new
policy of refusing Vietnamese who flee their homeland for economic
reasons.
   Refugees from political persecution still will be accepted under
the policy that began Monday, said Yoichiro Mizukami of the Justice
Ministry's Immigration Bureau.
   He said the decision to start the screening was made after the
two Chinese were discovered and detained for illegal entry.
   Other Asian countries have adopted similar screening policies for
Vietnamese boat people, but Japan so far had taken in all boat
people.
   The Justice Ministry said in a statement that immigration
authorities discovered the two Chinese among 107 Vietnamese boat
people who arrived in southwestern Japan in a wooden boat May 29.
   It said the two Chinese, both from Fujian province in
southeastern China, had pretended to be boat people in hopes of
becoming permament residents of Japan or at least finding work.
   Landing permission for the pair was retracted and they were taken
into custody, it added. A ministry official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Japan would deport them to their homeland but
declined to discuss details.
   The ministry also said remarks by the two Chinese led authorities
to believe many Chinese or Chinese-Vietnamese were included among
arriving boat people.
   Earlier, a Justice Ministry official said merchants in southern
China were helping many Vietnamese refugees travel by boat to Japan.
   Also Monday, another wooden vessel with 203 Vietnamese refugees
was found heading for Japan, an official of Japan's coast guard
said. The Justice Ministry said they would face screening under the
new policy.
   So far this year, 1,909 Vietnamese have arrived in Japan,
compared with 219 boat people in all of 1988, according to Justice
Ministry figures.
   Many refugees have said they came to Japan for a better economic
life, Ministry officials reported.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, on the eve of a drug
policy strategy session with top advisers, was noncommittal Monday
on the possibility of using covert military actions to help Colombia
fight drug lords.
   Bush was briefed on the Colombia situation at his seaside
vacation home by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft as the
South American nation's justice minister met with administration
officials in Washington. This came a day after reports surfaced that
the minister, Monica de Greiff, had resigned in the face of death
threats from drug traffickers.
   President Virgilio Barco informed U.S. officials that Ms. de
Greiff, was not resigning, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
   As he teed off for golf, the vacationing Bush was asked about a
Newsweek report that he was considering sending covert military
teams into Colombia to assist Barco's crackdown
   ``If I discussed covert action it wouldn't be covert. I don't
discuss that kind of thing at all,'' he replied.
   Bush cautioned that his reply should not be interpreted as a
``yes or a no or a confirm or a deny.''
   Popadiuk told reporters in response to a question about covert
operations: ``Obviously we are very concenrned about he Colombian
drug situation. .. but in terms of specific actions we may or may
not be undertaking, we just don't comment on any covert activities
that may or may not be undertaken.''
   Another administration official said that Bush would like to use
U.S. military teams and special forces to help Barco. But the
president's hands are tied by Barco's own statements that he does
not want such assistance, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Colombians are sensitive to the appearance of a heavy-handed
U.S. presence in their country, an image the Latin countries try to
avoid, the official said.
   Bush on Tuesday was to meet here with Attorney Gen. Dick
Thornburgh, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, Assistant Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger, CIA Director William Webster and drug
policy coordinator William Bennett.
   They were to help put the final touches on a national drug
strategy that Bush is to announce in a nationally broadcast White
House address Sept. 5.
   Popadiuk said that Ms. de Grieff was in Washington to discuss
efforts to break the drug cartels in Colombia and extradite to the
United States suspected traffickers.
   Asked if the 32-year-old minister discussed wanting asylum,
Popadiuk said, ``I do not know of any such discussions.'
   Bush later told reporters that it was ``too hypothetical'' to say
what advice he would give Ms. De Grieff about asylum.
   Thornburgh said Sunday he knew of no request for political asylum
from Ms. De Greiff, but said it ``would not be surprising'' in light
of the drug lords' violence.
   The officials, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
had heard unconfirmed reports that the Colombian minister's
3-year-old son, who accompanied her from Bogota, was the target of a
death threat.
   The White House announced Friday that Bush was sending $65
million in emergency aid to Colombia for the drug fight. It includes
$5 million to protect judges and other Colombian justice officials
threatened by the drug traffickers, who have warned they will kill
20 judges for each drug trafficker extradited to the United States.
   On another subject, the vacation White House announced Monday
that Bush formally asked Congress for a 3.6 percent pay raise for
federal civilian workers effective in January 1990, as previously
agreed to in budget negotiations.
   The president rejected pay advisers' recommendation of a 28.6
percent raise for the civil servants. Bush also warned South Korea
that he may bar fish imports if it does not reach an agreement with
the United States on driftnet fishing in the next 30 days.

<TEXT>
   Lajos Portisch of Hungary moved up to
share third place in the Chess World Cup on Monday after the
completion of the adjourned games.
   With four rounds remaining, world chess champion Garri Kasparov
and the former titleholder Anatoly Karpov, both Soviets, are tied
for first place with seven points out of a possible 11.
   Portisch defeated Valery Salov of the Soviet Union in a marathon
91-move battle when play resumed in their adjourned game from the
10th round.
   After a 30-minute break, Salov returned to complete his
unfinished 11th round game with British Grandmaster John Nunn. Their
game was agreed drawn on the 74th move.
   Portisch, Yasser Seirawan of the United States and British
Grandmaster Nigel Short are all tied for third with 6{ points.
   The World Cup is a series of six tournaments featuring the
world's top 25 grandmasters and a total prize fund of $1.2 million.
The 12th round is scheduled for Tuesday, and the final round will be
played Saturday.
   Widely regarded as the second most important chess event after
the individual world championship cycle, this final part of the
World Cup is the third strongest tournament ever held.
   Karpov, who held the world title for 10 years before losing it to
Kasparov in 1985, needs to win all four of his final games to catch
his countryman in the series.
   Since 1981, Kasparov has won or tied for first in every
tournament he has played.

<HEAD>Frank Grateful for Constituent Response; Professor Asks for Sodomy
Charges</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank said Monday that reaction
among friends and constituents to his relationship with a male
prostitute has been ``more generous than I really had any right to
expect.''
   Opponents kept up their criticism, however, and a law professor
asked prosecutors Monday to file felony sodomy charges against the
five-term Democrat from Massachusetts.
   On Friday, Frank confirmed details of a newspaper account of his
paying the man for sex once and then hiring him as a personal
assistant, believing he could help reform him. He said he fired the
man when he suspected he was selling sex from Frank's apartment.
   Frank said he did not believe he or anyone else in such a
situation should be prosecuted.
   ``I felt that they were poor judgments, and that if they
victimized anybody, they victimized me,'' he said. ``That is, I
never felt I was hurting anybody except myself.''
   Two polls published over the weekend showed that voters in the
state's 4th District still strongly supported Frank.
   Frank, 49, made two public appearances in Fall River over the
weekend where a few muffled ``boos'' were overwhelmed by applause
and cheers.
   ``I guess it means people think I've done a good job in the past.
It's nice to have that. I work hard at my job,'' he said. ``I'm
touched because right now, obviously, I'm chagrined and angry at
myself as I rethink all this.
   ``People are being nicer to me than I'm ready to be to myself
right now.''
   Alexander Tennant, executive director of the state Republican
Party, called on Frank to resign for apparently violating the law
and predicted that voter opinion will change once the GOP makes it
clear Frank not only hired a male prostitute but also wrote letters
on the man's behalf to his probation officer.
   ``The Democrats are arguing this is a personal matter. We are
arguing that there is a very serious public matter,'' Tennant said.
He and other Republicans are asking for an House ethics
investigation, to which Frank said he had no objection.
   George Washington law Professor John Banzhaf said ``many people
don't think Frank confessed to a crime. He has.''
   Banzhaf said he asked U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens of the District
of Columbia to also investigate other charges related to
prostitution, including running a bawdy house and soliciting for
prostitution.
   ``What Banzhaf is saying is that every gay person in Washington,
D.C., who is not totally abstinent is a criminal,'' said Frank.
   ``In a lot of districts, if two people who are not married have
any kind of sex they're breaking the law. And in some states if
married people have a certain kind of sex they're breaking the law
and ... I have always thought that was a mistake.''
   Felony sodomy in the District of Columbia carries up to 10 years
in prison. The other charges carry lesser penalties, said Banzhaf,
who teaches public interest law and has filed suits in a number of
corruption cases involving federal officials.
   Frank said he hired the male prostitute, Steve Gobie, to run
errands and do chores, hoping to help Gobie give up prostitution and
drugs. Frank said that two years ago he fired Gobie, who turns 33 on
Monday, because he suspected Gobie was selling sex out of the
congressman's apartment when he wasn't home.

<TEXT>
   A court ruling against the Energy Department's
award of a $1 billion management contract for the nation's first
high-level nuclear waste dump won't necessarily delay the project, a
senior department official said Monday.
   U.S. Claims Court Judge Reginald Gibson ruled last Thursday that
the department could award the contract to no one but TRW
Environmental Safety Systems Inc., an unsuccessful bidder which sued
on grounds that the department's means of selecting Bechtel Systems
Management Inc. as manager was improper and unfair.
   ``Over the short run, I can't see that that's a dramatic impact''
on the program, said Samuel Rousso, acting director of the
department's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, which
is administering the problem-ridden project.
   He said the department had not yet decided how to respond to
Gibson's ruling, including whether to appeal.
   ``The full decision paper has to be analyzed ... to see what the
thrust of the judge's position is and how we feel about that and
what we are at liberty to do about that,'' he said in an interview
in his office at department headquarters.
   Rousso said preparatory work for studies to determine the
geologic suitability of the proposed repository site, at Yucca
Mountain about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nev., is not
affected by Gibson's ruling. The studies are being held up, however,
by Nevada's refusal to grant the necessary environmental permits.
   Nuclear utilities are anxious to see the repository built because
some are being forced to spend millions of dollars to expand
temporary waste storage facilities. Utilities customers pay $400
million a year into a fund for the permanent dump.
   Rousso said significant delays in opening the dump by the target
date of 2003 could result if Gibson's ruling _ which is temporarily
sealed under court order _ forces the department to abandon its
plans to put a single company in charge of much of the project.
   He said Justice Department lawyers were still reviewing the
ruling and that neither he nor Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had
studied details of the decision.
   Gibson last week announced only the gist of his ruling, saying he
would give the companies involved until Wednesday to review the
formal document for any proprietary information or trade secrets
that should be removed before it is made public.
   Rousso also reiterated his denial of one of TRW's main charges:
that his involvement in the contract award process was a conflict of
interest. TRW asserted that the award was tainted by the fact that
Rousso worked for Science Applications International Corp., a
Bechtel subcontractor, before joining the Energy Department.
   Rousso said he worked for Science Applications for seven months
before coming to the department in 1986. The Yucca Mountain contract
proposal did not exist then, he said, adding that he has no
continuing ties with Science Applications.
   ``I hold no pension rights, no favoritism, no job promises, no
thoughts to that regard, and I don't see where any conflict of
interest has been shown,'' he said.
   Under federal law, Energy Department supervisory employees cannot
knowingly participating in department projects that involve any
energy company for which they worked within the past year.

<TEXT>
   People who think Oprah Winfrey looks
impossibly slim on the cover of this week's TV Guide are right _ the
talk show queen's face was superimposed on actress Ann-Margret's
hourglass figure.
   Appearing under the headline ``Oprah! The Richest Woman on TV?''
the illustration of Miss Winfrey in a gauzy dress atop a pile of
money is not identified as a composite.
   And TV Guide acknowledged Monday that unsuspecting readers might
think it's a real photograph.
   The lean body upon which Oprah's head rests is from a publicity
shot of Ann-Margret, according to the actress' publicist, George
Kirvay. The photo comes from a ``Rockette'' special Ann-Margret did
about 10 years ago, Kirvay said.
   ``I think she was shocked,'' Kirvay said of Ann-Margret's
reaction to TV Guide's cover for the Aug. 26-Sept. 1 issue. ``If you
look at the two pictures, they're identical. It's even her ring on
Oprah's hand.''
   The formerly overweight Miss Winfrey, who lost 67 pounds on a
diet in 1988, had no part whatsoever in the cover's making, said
Christine Tardio, a spokeswoman for Miss Winfrey's Harpo production
company.
   ``Oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that nor would she
pose in that revealing a dress. It's not something she would ever
do,'' Ms. Tardio said.
   David Sendler, TV Guide's national section editor, acknowledged
the illustration could be mistaken for a photograph. He said an
artist had used the Ann-Margret shot for creative inspiration.
   ``Ann-Margret should be thrilled because she's got another TV
Guide cover,'' Sendler said. ``And Oprah should be thrilled because
she looks terrific.''
   But Sendler said TV Guide had instructed the artist ``not to use
photographs so literally'' in the future.

<TEXT>
   Twelve masked Sikh militants armed with
automatic rifles stormed a passenger train in Punjab state and
massacred at least 22 Hindu passengers, a police official said
Monday.
   Director General K.P.S. Gill of Punjab police said at least 30
Hindus were wounded in the attack late Sunday, 10 seriously.
   The English-language Tribune newspaper, published in Punjab's
state capital, Chandigarh, put the toll at 70 dead and 150 wounded.
   Police said the gunmen forced the Suratgarh-to-Bhatinda train to
stop at Qabarwala in Fridkot district of the northern farming state,
85 miles south of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar and about 25 miles
from the Pakistan border.
   Gill said the train, carrying 450 people on its 50-mile scheduled
journey, had four armed security guards aboard, but that the
assailants fled before the guards could intervene.
   He said militants burst into three of the train's five cars,
separated the Hindu passengers from the Sikhs and then fired. Most
of the victims, including two women and three children, died inside
the compartments, he said.
   One 37-year-old Hindu woman, Shanti Devi, said the attackers
spared her because she was feeding her newborn girl. ``I prayed for
them to spare me,'' she said.
   Security officials in Punjab and in surrounding Haryana and
Rajashtan states were put on full alert after the attack, Gill said.
   In August 1988, Sikh radicals raided a train in a similar attack
and killed 11 Hindus.
   Sikh extremists have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
Sikh nation in Punjab, complaining of discrimination by the Hindus,
India's religious majority.
   The Sikhs make up about 2 percent of India's 880 million people,
but comprise a slight majority in Punjab. Hindus make up 82 percent
of the Indian population.
   At least 1,224 deaths in Punjab have been blamed on Sikh attacks
so far this year.

<TEXT>
   The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America
voted overwhelmingly Monday to sell all stock in companies operating
in South Africa by Sept. 1, 1991, despite objections the
denomination could lose money.
   ``Prudence is a Christian virtue, and I'm not going to listen to
pagan lawyers tell me how to be a prudent Christian,'' said Bishop
William Lazareth of New York City, who supported the deadline.
   An estimated 85 percent of the 1,041 delegates voted for the
deadline in a show-of-cards vote. At stake was the church's $1.6
billion pension fund, of which $84.9 million is invested in
companies doing business in South Africa.
   The meeting is the first since the 1988 merger of the Lutheran
Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and the Association
of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   The divestment move is aimed at pushing South Africa to end
apartheid, which establishes a racially segregated society in which
the country's 28 million blacks are dominated by 5 million whites.
   ``It's a matter of outrage,'' said Bishop Harold Jensen of
Washington, D.C. ``We can't deal with it simply on a rational
basis.''
   Several Protestant denominations, particularly the Episcopal
Church, the United Church of Christ, the Church of the Brethren and
the Quakers have had strong divestment policies, but none has sold
all its holdings.
   The assembly, in the sixth day of an eight-day meeting, also
approved a major missions program for the 1990s.
   The vote on divestment followed nearly three hours of debate
among delegates in the 5.3 million-member denomination, the
third-largest among U.S. Protestants.
   Before the vote, investment specialist John Kapanke, president of
the denomination's Board of Pensions, said a deadline threatened
financial responsibility.
   Kapanke said at a news conference later that constraints on
investments ``could jeopardize them and increase risks.''
   He and others said the denomination could be opening itself to a
lawsuit accusing it of violating its fiduciary responsibility.
   ``We should not fight our social battles with other people's
money,'' said the Rev. Elvin Bjork of Salem, Ore. ``We could do a
great deal of damage to the pension fund.''
   Deadline supporters argued that ``fiduciary'' meant faithfulness
to justice as well as to money.
   Bishop Sherman Hicks of Chicago said, ``All things belong to God,
including money,'' and that the church has do what's right
regardless of what he called lesser considerations.
   A resolutions committee had proposed a measure asking the
pensions board to work more aggressively to sell off the stock, but
set no deadline. However, the delegates chose the stiffer
substitute, offered by Bishop David Olson of Minneapolis.
   In addition to setting the 1991 deadline, the resolution defined
companies to be divested as those with direct and indirect
operations in South Africa.

   Hundreds of people are looking on high to
lose weight here below.
   They take off the fat through a program called First Place, which
combines prayer and Bible study with diet, exercise and support
meetings.
   ``There's more to losing weight than just losing weight,'' said
Kathy Whitlock, First Place leader at Parkway Christian Fellowship.
``There's the part of you that needs spiritual fullness. It takes
someone bigger than you to keep it off.''
   Whitlock has dropped 65 pounds, her husband has lost about 60,
and their 11-year-old daughter has slimmed down by 10 to 15 pounds.
   Nine Alabama churches offer or are adding the program, which
began in Houston in 1981. Its name comes from Jesus' words in
Matthew 6:33: ``Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.''
   The idea is for participants to concentrate on giving God first
place in their lives and letting God help them curb their eating,
said Jo Batson, a minister at Dawson Memorial Baptist Church.
   Weekly themes include temptation, spiritual food and the battle
of the bulge. First Place also uses behavior modification techniques
to help participants be conscious of when, where and why they
overeat.
   The First Place food plan is called ``Live-It,'' rather than
diet, ``because the first three letters of diet are `die,''' Batson
said.

   Jim Defew wanted to custom-design a car
that people wouldn't forget. So he painted his 1934 Chevy pink and
purple _ down to the engine and hubcaps.
   With a blue, orange and yellow graphic down the side, interior
trimmed in snake skin, and a pair of fuzzy dice and pink and purple
garters dangling from the rear-view mirror, Defew's car stood out
from the 1,700 others displayed last weekend at a hot rod show at
the Vanderburgh County 4-H Fairgrounds.
   ``When people see a black or red car, they just walk up and look
at it, but everybody just starts smiling when they walk up to (my)
car. You can make people happy by the colors you use,'' he said.
   ``I had to design the color myself,'' Defew said. ``We got to
mixing and matching until we came up with the right combination.''
   Defew, 43, of Denton, Ky., has been building custom automobiles
for 25 years. He spends every other summer weekend traveling to
shows across the country. Sometimes he puts his cars up for sale,
though he said it would take more than $50,000 to get him to part
with the pink and purple Chevy.
   ``It's part of me; that's all I can say about it,'' he said.
``It's hard to put a value on something like this when you put so
much time into it.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has told officials
of the Lithuanian Communist Party that the Baltic republic has gone
too far in its drive for independence, an activist said Monday.
   Also on Monday, the Communist Party daily newspaper Pravda
accused the People's Front of Moldavia _ comprised of ethnic
activists in the southern republic of Moldavia _ of trying to ``take
power on the crest of a muddy wave of chauvinism and separatism.''
   In Vilnius, Lithuania, Romaldus Olozus, a member of the governing
council, or Sejm, of the Sajudis grassroots movement, said he and
four colleagues met with Lithuanian Communist Party chief Algirdas
Brazauskas on Monday after Gorbachev called the Lithuanian party
leader on Friday and Sunday to express his concern.
   Brazauskas told the Sajudis members ``Gorbachev is concerned
about what's happening in Lithuania _ that what had happened so far
was worth supporting, but that now we'd gone too far,'' Olozus said
by telephone.
   On Saturday, the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee in
Moscow issued a stinging statement saying separatists were leading
the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into an abyss.
The statement came days after more than 1 million Baltic people
joined hands in a human chain to protest the 1939 agreement between
Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler that assigned the then-independent
Baltics to a Soviet sphere of influence.
   The government of Lithuania and the Communist Party of a second
Baltic republic, Latvia, came into line Monday behind the party
statement.
   The Tass news agency said the Latvian party issued a statement
calling the party's stance ``the basis for concrete action for
normalizing the social-political situation in the country.''
   In Lithuania, the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet
legislature rejected a commission's findings that the inorporation
of Lithuania into the Soviet Union by Stalin in 1940 was an
``international crime.''
   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, said the findings did
not take into account Lithuania's political situation in 1939-40,
and would ``lead the republic into a political dead end and serve
poorly in the transfer to economic independence.''
   It turned the Supreme Soviet commission's work back to it until a
national panel finishes its review, Izvestia said.
   Olozus said Gorbachev apparently was upset with the findings of
the Lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legal
argument for full independence.
   A meeting of Communist Party activists was called Monday in
Vilnius, but nothing was known of its results.
   The confrontation with the Kremlin was ``inescapable,'' but the
resistance might slow down the Sajudis-led drive for greater
autonomy, if not outright independence from Moscow, Olozus said.
   The grassroots movement will continue on the same path, ``but the
steps can be slower or faster, depending on the concrete
situation,'' he said.
   Sajudis Chairman Vytautus Landsbergis also indicated Sunday the
Kremlin statement ``will make some problems for us.'' But he added
he didn't expect the Kremlin to crush the movement. ``I don't think
they're madmen,'' he said.
   Olozus said no special meeting of Sajudis was planned to discuss
the Kremlin reaction, but that Landsbergis would speak on Lithuanian
TV Tuesday night.
   He said he had an impression from talking to Brazauskas that
Gorbachev did not entirely support the strident tone of the Central
Committee statement, but that ``his reaction was one of
disappointment.''
   In Moldavia, representatives of the Moldavian People's Front met
leaders of a council representing non-Moldavian workers who have
been on strike since last week to protest a draft law making
Moldavian the republic's official language, Tass reported. It did
not report any progress in their dispute over the language law.
   The republic's Supreme Soviet is to take up the issue at a
meeting Tuesday in the capital of Kishinev. On Sunday, thousands
rallied there to protest or support the law.
   Russians, Ukrainians and other minorities who together make up 36
percent of Moldavia's 4.2 million people are concerned the law will
be the first step toward a policy of discriminating against
non-Moldavians.
   Pravda on Monday said that the crowd drawn to Kishinev's Lenin
Square on Sunday by the People's Front had ``submitted to long-term
brainwashing by nationalist-minded ideologists.''
   ``Those who have led the Moldavian population to ethnic strife,
exploiting perestroika slogans as a cover-up, are pursuing their
personal aims and seek to take power on the crest of a muddy wave of
chauvinism and separatism,'' it said.
   It said the strikers, who have walked off the job at more than
100 factories and offices, were particularly upset with a provision
of the law that would make Moldavian not only the government
language, but the language of ``inter-ethnic communications.''
   The strikers say that will force even predominantly non-Moldavian
cities to use Moldavian as the language of communications between
different ethnic groups.

<HEAD>Coal Strike Suffocating Mining Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CLINTWOOD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decent pair of shoes is as hard to find
as a patch of flat land in this coal mining community now that the
last clothing store has shut its doors.
   The strike against the Pittston Coal Group is slowly suffocating
Dickenson County, where nearly a third of the striking United Mine
Workers live.
   The county had been in an economic downturn for more than four
years when the strike began April 5. Since then, the county has lost
coal tax revenue, the school budget has been cut deeply and
businesses have been hurt by the lack of buying power.
   The county's unemployment rate for July, announced Monday, was
9.2 percent, second-highest in the state.
   ``It's really put a strain on the community as a whole,'' said
Henry Vanover, the county administrator.
   But the loyalty of its people to the union remains as deep as the
black veins that provide the county's lifeblood.
   ``You can go into any town and find widespread community support
for the union and the union's position,'' Commonwealth's Attorney
Gerald Gray said.
   Carrol Deckard, for example, said she donates 10 percent of the
sales at her craft and novelty store in Clintwood, The Odd Shop, to
the union.
   ``This is a coal mining town. It's all we've got,'' she said.
``The union brought decent wages here where people used to work for
$1 an hour. If the union doesn't get a contract, we're gone. We've
already lost three stores.''
   The geography that makes Dickenson County rich in coal and lured
miners from Scotland and Ireland a century ago also makes it
dependent on the mineral.
   The rugged county is surrounded by large mountain ranges. The
county needs to upgrade its roads and its water and sewer systems to
compete for industry, Gray said.
   But the government can barely make ends meet now and may have to
borrow before the end of the fiscal year to provide essential
services, Vanover said.
   To show both the isolation of the area and the closeness of its
people, Gray noted that 95 percent of the people living in the
county are descendants of the original settlers.
   Pittston owns about 70 percent of the surface land and 95 percent
of the underground reserves, Gray said. ``In essence, they are the
landlords and we are the tenants,'' he said.
   Although Pittston denies it is trying to do away with collective
bargaining, the residents and business owners believe for the most
part that the company is trying to break the union. That is making
the stakes of the strike higher than any previous labor dispute and
drawing the community together.
   Most of the replacement workers are from out of state. When local
residents cross over, Gray said, it splits families.
   Denny Boggs pointed to a trailer next to his service station and
said the woman who lives there disowned her father when he went to
work for Pittston.
   ``People who have been friends all their lives are being
separated, kids who grew up together,'' Harold Willis added as he
paid Boggs for his gas.
   Pittston's replacement workers are digging 40 percent less coal
than normal, which means a 40 percent reduction in coal severance
taxes. Vanover estimated that the county has lost $200,000 in
anticipated severance tax revenue and will continue to lose about
$60,000 each month the strike goes on.
   The schools open next week with their budget for the year cut
$400,000.
   ``It doesn't look very good for us, even to maintain present
standards,'' Assistant Superintendent Gerald Triplett said. The
county has cut four teaching positions, and more reductions are
possible, he said.
   There is no indication the strike involving Pittston's 1,695
union employees in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky will end
soon.
   Real estate and personal property taxes counted on in the county
budget are due Dec. 5, and many striking miners may not be able to
pay them, Gray said.
   Several stores have gone bankrupt. The striking miners are making
$200 a week in strike pay compared with $500 a week before they
walked out, which means they have only enough to cover groceries and
monthly bills.
   ``The loss of revenue is a strain, but the worst part is the
effect on people, their spirits, the longer it goes,'' Vanover said.

<HEAD>Cracking Down on `Mall Rats' Could Cost Managers Big Bucks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minor crackdown against ``mall rats'' at a few
Massachusetts shopping centers runs counter to the thinking at most
retail arcades, where free-spending kids are given a lot of space.
   ``Teens have a large retail impact at the malls, so to lose them
would be to lose a lot,'' said Peter Zollo, president of Teenage
Research Unlimited, a Chicago-based firm that compiles spending
statistics.
   Even though their video displays and junk food havens act as
magnets for bored youngsters on hot summer afternoons, some mall
managers said Monday that loiterers aren't welcome.
   And in several cases, kids have been arrested for trespassing.
   Last month, a 14-year-old was picked up while waiting for his
mother at Shoppers' World in Framingham, police said. At least four
other such arrests have been made at the same mall this summer and
similar incidents have been reported elsewhere.
   Jamie LeBlanc, 15, said he and his pals frequent The Watertown
Mall and regularly spend money on the latest tapes and newest
fashions. Lately, he said, they've repeatedly run into trouble.
   ``I was sitting in Dunkin' Donuts with my friends and a cop
tapped his billy club on my shoulder and told me to get out,'' said
LeBlanc, who had bought a cup of coffee. ``I was just sitting there
smoking a cigarette, not bothering anyone.''
   Zollo said taking a hard line on teen-age conduct could be
instant death for shopkeepers and cinema owners who rent space in
malls expressly because of the ready audience.
   Every year, youngsters between the ages of 12 and 19 spend $31.3
billion of their own money at shops nationwide and account for $79
billion in retail business when the money their parents gives them
is factored in, Zollo's research found.
   Last week alone, 13 million teen-agers bought movie tickets and
during the summer nearly 65 percent of the nation's 27 million
teen-agers saw at least one feature, he said.
   ``Obviously malls hold two functions for teens,'' Zollo said.
``One is of a social nature and the other is shopping. They do both
there and the more time they spend, the more money they spend.''
   Mall owners agreed they don't want to discourage teens from
coming, but said they have to draw the line somewhere.
   ``It's a delicate balance,'' said Henry Hudson, general manager
at the South Shore Plaza in Braintree. ``The mall managers have to
maintain control in the centers for the benefit of the patrons.''
   Boston police spokesman Scott Gillis said anywhere from five to
15-plus officers patrol busy city shopping areas for troublemakers,
especially during vacation time.
   ``We tell people (loiterers) to move on and if it gets to be a
problem we lock them up for disorderly conduct,'' he said.
``Nuisance-type loitering is definitely not acceptable and will not
be tolerated.''
   Randy Boon, a researcher at Stillerman Jones and Co., an
Indianapolis-based marketing research firm, said mall managers don't
want to see a few overactive or offensive kids discourage business
overall.
   ``It's a big thing. A lot of customers that go in tend to be
scared away if there are a lot of kids hanging out who don't seem to
be doing anything,'' he said.
   No one wants to see kids wreaking havoc at their local malls, but
a little goofing off is to be expected, said Carolyn Kennedy,
general manager at Assembly Square Mall in nearby Somerville.
   ``Shopping centers are a gathering place. Kids don't have malt
shops anymore,'' she said. ``They need a place to go.''

<HEAD>Duty On Canadian Pork Approved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Trade Commission cleared the
way for a duty on imports of subsidized Canadian pork, ruling Monday
that the shipments have hurt American meatpackers.
   However, Canada is contesting the duty before a two-nation panel
set up by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement and could appeal the
commission's 3-2 ruling.
   The Commerce Department imposed the 3-cent-per-pound duty in
July, but the commission was required to find that American
producers were being injured by the Canadian subsidy.
   Canadian pork imports ``present a real and imminent threat to the
domestic industry,'' said Commissioner David B. Rohr.
   ``Today's decision is a victory for U.S. pork producers and fair
trade,'' said Don Gingerich, president of the National Pork
Producers Council. ``The countervailing duty should send a clear
signal to the Canadian pork industry to curb its excess production.''
   Imports of Canadian pork products have increased by more than 52
percent since 1984, according to the producers group.
   The duty applies to shipments of subsidized fresh, chilled and
frozen pork from Canada. The Commerce Department imposed the duty
after determining that Canadian payment programs amount to a subsidy
on pork. The revenue was put into escrow until the commission ruled.
   Canadian pork representatives petitioned last week for the
appeals panel to review the Commerce Department's decision, and the
Canadian government expressed disappointment with the commission's
decision Monday.
   ``We do not agree with this ruling,'' said Canadian Agriculture
Minister Don Mazankowski. ``In our view, the Canadian industry had
made a compelling case before the commission for a no-injury finding
in this investigation.''
   Commission Chairman Anne Brunsdale, who voted against the
commission's finding, said she did not think the Canadian subsidy
was a significant threat to U.S. meatpackers.
   She said Canadian pork imports amounted to just 0.4 percent of
U.S. production.
   Rep. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., wrote President Bush Monday urging him
to raise the issue of pork imports when he meets Wednesday with
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   ``Truckloads of subsidized Canadian pork products are being
dumped over the border, where they unfairly undercut producers from
South Dakota and other states,'' Johnson said.

   President Bush on Monday praised
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for being ``extraordinarily
understanding'' of the changes taking place in Eastern Europe and
expressed hope that change can continue peacefully both outside the
Soviet Union and within it.
   The president also said it wil take ``a lot more money'' than his
$119 million aid package to help Poland rebuild its economy, but
said that political and economic reforms must come first.
   Bush said that once reforms take hold in Poland, more aid will be
forthcoming from the international financial institutions that help
developing countries.
   The president spoke with reporters on the lawn outside his
oceanfront home after getting a firsthand report from Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., on their just-completed visit to Poland and their talks with
the country's new leaders.
   Asked whether the Soviet Communist Party's criticism of the
Baltic nationalism movement might be a prelude to a crackdown, the
president said, ``I hope not.''
   Gorbachev has told officials of the Lithuanian Communist Party
that the Baltic republic has gone too far in its drive for
independence, an activist said Monday.
   In Vilnius, Lithuania, Romaldus Ozolus, a member of the governing
council, or Sejm, of the Sajudis grassroots movement, said he and
four colleagues met with Lithuanian Communist Party chief Algirdas
Brazauskas after Gorbachev called the Lithuanian party leader on
Friday and Sunday to express his concern.
   Bush said, ``I think that Mr. Gorbachev's reaction to the changes
in Poland were extraordinarily understanding and certainly not
militant in any way, and I hope that would be the tone as the rapid
change that's taking place in Eastern Europe goes forward, not just
in Poland, but in other countries as well.''
   ``I must say the way Mr. Gorbachev has handled this and reacted
to it has been very positive,'' the president said.
   ``Let's hope that change continues to take place peacefully, and
not only outside the Soviet Union, but in it. ... We want to see
perestroika succeed,'' he said.
   Bush said that if Solidarity leader Lech Walesa visits the United
States later this year, ``I certainly will'' meet with him.
   On another topic, Bush declined to say what advice he would give
Colombian Minister of Justice Monica de Greiff if she seeks asylum
in the United States. ``It's too hypothetical for me to answer that
question,'' he said.
   The Doles made a detour here on their way home from Europe after
visiting Morocco, Armenia, Poland and The Netherlands. They brought
Bush a letter from Walesa, as well as their own letter outlining the
urgency of the appeals they heard for help from Polish leaders,
including new Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowecki and President Wojiech
Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party chief.
   The Doles also brought Bush greetings from Morocco's King Hassan,
who has been in the midst of efforts to end the strife in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Dole said of Poland, ``It was incredible and it was really
awesome to be there at this particular time in the history of
Poland.''
   She said the Poles appreciate the help Bush has already
proferred. ``They're seeking more foreign investment and hoping that
our banks will establish branches in Poland. ... And they're
concerned about food. They feel that some change there within the
short term is important because the shelves are empty and they need
more food,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Her husband, the Kansas senator, said Polish leaders all
``indicated some urgency'' and one ``used the word `emergency.' ''
   ``We came away with the feeling that maybe the time is not great.
Maybe it's 60 days, maybe it's three months. Walesa said yesterday
maybe it's six months to a year, the people need to see a change,''
the senator said.
   He added, ``They don't want to be a welfare client. They want
investments. They want banks. They want opportunities. And it's
going to take a while to change that system after 45 years ... to a
market economy.''
   Asked if he felt $119 million was enough, Bush said, ``I think to
satisfy all the requirements of Poland, it could take a lot more
money than that. But it's also got to take political reform. It's
got to take economic reform so that when they talk about investment
and privatization, something really happens.''
   ``And once those reforms are in place and on forward, then you
will find that your multilateral financial institutions will be in a
much better place to help,'' said Bush, who added that he hopes that
support will build in Congress for those lending institutions.
   Mrs. Dole said her department will dispatch a team to help Poland
on such matters as job training and unemployment insurance once the
new government selects a labor minister.
   The Doles made the sidetrip here via a Marine helicopter after
landing at Pease Air Force Base in neighboring New Hampshire on
their way home to Washington. They were joined by Rep. Bob McEwen,
R-Ohio, and his wife, Liz, who visited Poland separately and picked
up with the Doles in The Netherlands.
   Walt Riker, the senator's aide, said the Doles called Bush on
Sunday to request the meeting because of their own sense of urgency.
``There's a limited window of opportunity now in Poland,'' Riker
said.
   Dole said the devastation in Armenia from last December's
earthquake was ``heart-rending,'' and he said 700,000 people are
still homeless from the disaster that killed 35,000 to 50,000
Armenians.
   Bush, meantime, went fishing, but failed to catch anything,
keeping intact a bad streak that began Aug. 16, the first day of his
vacation.

<HEAD>Policy of Prosecuting Drug-Using Mothers Encourages Hope, Draws Criticism</HEAD>

   A decision by local authorities to
prosecute mothers whose babies test positive for drugs has civil
libertarians afraid the threat of criminal charges will deter
addicts from seeking prenatal care.
   Four infants born with cocaine or heroin in their systems have
been taken from their mothers in the last month and placed in foster
homes or protective custody.
   The solicitor's office responsible for Greenville and Pickens
counties has charged three of the mothers and the parents of the
fourth mother, a 15-year-old girl, with child neglect. No trial
dates have been set.
   Authorities said it is necessary to prosecute these women to
force them to get treatment for their addictions.
   The policy drew criticism from the American Civil Liberties
Union, which fears women will shy away from seeking prenatal care or
treatment for addiction for fear their newborns will be taken away
and they will be prosecuted.
   The Greenville-Pickens policy makes it ``a crime to be
pregnant,'' said Lynn Paltrow, staff attorney for the ACLU in New
York.
   ``Assuming these women really took drugs, addiction is a
physiological health problem,'' Ms. Paltrow said. ``It's an illness
that needs treatment.''
   Solicitor Joseph J. Watson's district in Greenville and Pickens
counties has a population of 367,000. The district in northwestern
South Carolina is a mix of rural and industrial areas, with industry
concentrated near Greenville.
   The South Carolina county is one of the first in the nation to
expand a criminal child neglect charge to cover drug-abusing mothers.
   Conviction carries up to 10 years in prison, but only probation
and treatment will be recommended, Assistant Solicitor Catherine
Chrisotophillis said.
   Elsewhere, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson signed a law Thursday
expanding child-neglect law to protect newborns who test positive
for illegal drugs.
   In Florida, a woman whose two children tested positive for
cocaine was placed on 15 years' probation Friday for drug delivery,
a charge routinely used against drug dealers. A judge ruled she
delivered drugs via the umbilical cord.
   Similar cases in at least three other states _ California, Texas
and Ohio _ have been dismissed.
   Prosecuting women for using drugs while pregnant is necessary to
identify such women who might not otherwise come forward for
treatment, Watson and Ms. Christophillis said. They said it should
not deter women from seeking prenatal care.
   ``I feel if we can rehabilitate (the mothers) now, we can save
another baby being born,'' Ms. Christophillis said.
   Watson acknowledged, however, that ``to emphasize the punishment
side of things could potentially drive mothers away from the
hospital.''
   Watson said women whose infants showed signs of fetal alcohol
syndrome would also be prosecuted.

<TEXT>
   A jury acted correctly when it convicted a man of
armed assault with intent to rob for trying to hold up a restaurant
while armed with a hairbrush, the state Court of Appeals ruled
Monday.
   Christopher Johnson's previous five tries at robbing Boston's
Dragon Inn Restaurant, four of them while brandishing a firearm,
made it reasonable for employees to assume he was armed when he made
a sixth attempt, the court said.
   ``To the cashier and night cook of the Dragon Inn Restaurant ...
the defendant Johnson had become a familiar face,'' Appeals Court
Justice Rudolph Kass wrote in a unanimous opinion.
   Johnson was shot and apprehended on the sixth attempt, Kass said.
Police found no gun on him, only a hairbrush.
   Johnson was convicted on five grand jury indictments of armed
robbery and one indictment of armed assault with intent to commit
robbery.
   The trial judge sentenced him to concurrent nine- to 15-year
sentences on each of the six counts.

   Joseph Alsop, a political columnist for 37
years, died Monday at his Georgetown home here. He was 78.
   Alsop's health had been declining for several months, said
Patricia Alsop, wife of his late brother, Stewart. His death was
attributed to lung cancer, anemia and emphysema, Mrs. Alsop said.
   The Alsop brothers, who began as New Deal liberals in the spirit
of their cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt but became more
conservative in later years, wrote a political column syndicated by
the now-defunct New York Herald Tribune.
   Alsop started his career as a newsman at the Herald Tribune after
graduating from Harvard University in 1932. Five years later, he
began writing a political column for the North American Newspaper
Alliance. He wrote his first books, ``The 168 Days'' and ``Men
Around the President,'' in 1938.
   He wrote several other books, including ``We Accuse'' with
brother Stewart.
   Alsop wrote a column for the Herald Tribune with his brother from
1946-1958, at which time his brother joined The Saturday Evening
Post. Joseph Alsop continued the column alone, first for The
Washington Post and later for The Los Angeles Times Syndicate. He
also contributed articles for magazines, including The New Yorker.
   He retired from daily and weekly writing in 1974, the year
Stewart died, but continued to write books and articles.
   He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Navy in 1940. He
resigned the commission in August 1941 and joined the American
Volunteer Air Group as an aide to Gen. Claire Chennault of the
Flying Tigers. Alsop was captured by the Japanese in Hong Kong in
December 1941 and held prisoner until he was exchanged in June 1942.
Later he served as chief of the Lend Lease Mission to China and in
1943 went to China as a captain in the Army Air Forces.
   In retirement, he became known for his Asian art collection and
was invited to lecture at the National Gallery of Art as part of the
Andrew W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts in 1977.
   Alsop, whose 17-year marriage to Susan Mary Alsop ended in 1978,
had no children.
   The Avon, Conn., native leaves two stepchildren, William S.
Patten of Camden, Maine, and Anne Milliken of Salt Lake City; a
brother, John deKoven Alsop of Old Lyme, Conn.; and a sister,
Corinne Chubb of Chester, N.J.
   A funeral service is planned for 11 a.m. Thursday at St. John's
Episcopal Church at Lafayette Square in Washington. Family members
also are planning to hold a memorial service in September. A date
has not been set.

<HEAD>President Proposes 3.6 Percent Raise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday recommended
to Congress a 3.6 percent pay raise for federal employees,
formalizing an agareement worked out last spring.
   The raise, agreed upon by congressional leaders and the
administration, would be effective in January 1990.
   A letter containing the formal recommendation from Bush to House
Speaker Thomas Foley was released by the travelling White House
accompanying Bush on his vacation in Kennebunkport.
   Bush wrote that the government's pay advisory commission had
concluded a pay raise of 28.6 percent would be consistent with
current provisions requiring federal government pay to be comparable
with private-sector pay.
   However, Bush noted he has the power to alter the comparability
rules in the case of national emergency or economic conditions
affecting the general welfare.
   He said that 28.6 percent raise would be unacceptable because of
``adverse budgetary and economic effects.''
   Initially, Bush had proposed a 2 percent federal pay increase in
his 1990 budget request.
   In addition, Bush has previously recommended pay increases of up
to 25 percent for some top level federal executives, although
legislation pending in the House would freeze that pay and that of
judges.
   ``We feel there is a better alternative'' to the House proposal,
White House spokesman Steve Hart said Monday in reference to the
president's pay increase propoals for senior executives and judges.

<HEAD>French Mayor and Moslem Leader Sign Pace to Build Mosque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Charvieu-Chavagneux and the head
of the local Moslem community signed a pact Monday aimed at easing
religious tension caused by the city bulldozing a mosque.
   Mayor Gerard Dezempte and Abdelhag Benyaya, president of the
Islamic Cultural Association, said they ``condemned any act of
violence against people and property as well as statements urging
the communities to confront each other.''
   A joint statement said the two agreed the town will have a new
mosque.
   Dezempte campaigned for re-election last spring saying he opposed
granting a permit to build a new mosque because it would attract
more Moslems to the community.
   Charview-Chavagneux, a town of 8,000 people about 20 miles east
of Lyon, became a national focus for religious tension when the
building used as a Mosque by 800 Moslems was knocked down on Aug. 16.
   The battering began just after early morning prayers, and one of
those inside was slightly injured.
   Dezempte said the bulldozer was supposed to knock down a
different wing of the building, not the one used as a mosque.
   The following day several city properties were set ablaze and
suffered minor damage.
   Benyaya said Monday he will pursue charges he filed accusing the
mayor of violating Moslems' religious freedom by destroying the
mosque, but will stop holding Friday prayers in front of City Hall
as a protest.
   Dezempte said he will not withdraw his criminal charges of arson
against unknown perpetrators for the fires on city property.
   France has about 3 million Moslems, many immigrants or children
of North African immigrants, in a population of 55 million. Islam is
the country's second-largest religion after Roman Catholicism.

<HEAD>Sakharov Looking for Missing Swedish Diplomat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet activist Andrei Sakharov visited
labor camps in search of Raoul Wallenberg this year but found no
trace of the Swedish diplomat missing since 1945, Svenska Dagbladet
newspaper said Monday.
   A Swedish Foreign Ministry official confirmed the Soviet human
rights activist recently elected a legislator was pursuing
Wallenberg's fate. He also said the ministry has released previously
classified documents to the newspaper.
   Svenska Dagbladet quoted documents as relating that Sakharov
heard of another long-term prisoner in the Soviet Union who, the
paper concluded, may have been confused with Wallenberg.
   The Swedish diplomat is credited with rescuing tens of thousands
of Hungarian Jews from Nazi extermination before he was arrested in
1945 by Soviet troops entering Budapest.
   Soviet officials say files discovered in 1957 show Wallenberg
died of natural causes in prison 10 years earlier. But other
prisoners reported seeing Wallenberg long after he allegedly died.
He would be 77 years old now.
   Vollrath Tham, the Foreign Ministry official in charge of
Wallenberg's case, confirmed Sakharov had visited labor camps to
seek word of the missing man. Sakharov's last communication was in
March, he said.
   Tham declined to disclose further information. He said
``substantial parts'' of the Wallenberg file remain classified and
were withheld from Svenska Dagbladet.
   The paper said it examined more than 6,000 pages of documents.
   It reported a December conversation between Sakharov and Andrs
Wijkman, head of the Swedish Red Cross.
   Sakharov told Wijkman that, acting on information from a Swedish
source, he and his wife Yelena Bonner searched for Wallenberg at two
labor camps near Torzhok, 125 miles northwest of Moscow, but found
no trace of him.
   The Nobel Peace Prize winner also reported learning about a
recently released prisoner called Einar Marcus who helped save Jews
in Czechoslovakia from Nazi deportation.
   Marcus, who apparently is of Swedish descent, had told a friend
of Sakharov about his wartime service and that, like Wallenberg, he
was arrested at the end of the war.
   The paper concluded that if the story is correct, several people
who reported seeing a Swedish diplomat in prison may have met
Marcus, not Wallenberg.
   Sakharov suggested Sweden send an envoy to talk to Marcus, who
now lives in Syktyvkar, 600 miles northeast of Moscow.
   On Sunday, Soviet television broadcast a report on Wallenberg for
the first time and appealed to anyone who had any information on him
to step forward.
   The broadcast was the latest sign of glasnost, or openness, on
the case which Soviet authorities had tried to bury for years.
   No reason was ever given for Wallenberg's arrest, but it is
assumed he was mistaken for a spy.

   Neptune's icy volcanic moon Triton is the
coldest body ever measured in the solar system, NASA said Monday,
and the planet itself has something in common with Los Angeles: smog.
   The Voyager 2 space probe also discovered auroras vaguely like
Earth's northern lights on Neptune and Triton, scientists said.
   Looking backward 3.2 million miles, Voyager 2 on Monday snapped a
series of family portraits of Neptune and Triton, appearing as
crescents as they were backlighted by the sun.
   Earlier, Voyager 2's ultraviolet detector determined that
Triton's surface temperature is 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
making the moon ``the coldest body we have seen in the solar
system,'' said Roger Yelle of the University of Arizona.
   Scientists believe Pluto and its moon Charon are the
second-coldest bodies in the solar system.
   In another finding, the best close-up photo yet of another moon,
1989 N1, showed that Neptune's second-largest moon has a huge crater
about half as wide as the lumpy-looking, 240-mile-wide satellite.
   That indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 N1,
one of six moons discovered since June by Voyager, according to
Bradford Smith, the leader of Voyager's photographic imaging team.
   Voyager also sent back heat measurements to help scientists find
liquid lakes or oceans on Triton, but the moon almost certainly is
too cold to have them, said Torrence Johnson, a scientist at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory here.
   Johnson defended the theory, advanced by other scientists Sunday,
that Triton has active volcanoes that erupt nitrogen ice particles
20 miles skyward. ``It isn't a crazy idea,'' he said.
   Voyager's close encounter with Neptune occurred Thursday night
and it passed Triton on Friday, capping its epic tour of the four
outer planets, including Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The probe has also found five rings, including three thin ones
and two broad bands of dust.
   1989 N1 took Nereid's place as Neptune's second-largest moon
after Triton. N1 and the other five moons discovered by Voyager in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth,
have not yet been permanently named.
   The latest data returned by Voyager's ultraviolet light sensor
revealed auroras somewhat like Earth's northern and southern lights
over wide sections of Neptune's skies and over much of Triton's day
side, said Yelle.
   But unlike Earth's auroras, which glow in visible light as
electrically charged particles excite nitrogen and oxygen gases, the
auroras on Neptune and Triton are invisible to the human eye. That's
because they glow in ultraviolet light caused when the particles
excite hydrogen gas.
   Sunlight hitting natural gas, or methane, high in Neptune's
atmosphere ``converts it into photochemical smog'' that forms a
90-mile-thick icy layer at the bottom of Neptune's stratosphere,
said Jim Pollock, an imaging team member from NASA's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View, Calif.
   Smith said smog on Neptune and in Los Angeles have ``definite
similarities,'' although Los Angeles smog has components absent on
Neptune.
   Finding smog on Neptune ``is no surprise,'' Smith said.
``Photochemical smog exists any place (planet or moon) we've been
that has an atmosphere. In Los Angeles, the problem is it's
happening way down low where we have to breathe it in amounts
exceeding anything we've seen except on Titan,'' Saturn's smoggy
moon.
   Auroras on planets are caused when electrically charged particles
from the solar wind spiral toward a planet's magnetic poles along
magnetic field lines. On Earth, the magnetic poles are tilted only
12 degrees away from the poles around which the planet rotates, so
auroras appear as northern and southern lights in polar regions.
   Neptune's major magnetic poles are tilted 50 degrees away from
its rotational poles, and scientists have said the planet may have
multiple magnetic poles. That could explain why Neptune's auroras
appear over wide areas of the planet.
   Triton's aurora is created differently. Electrically charged
particles in Neptune's orbiting radiation belt, discovered recently
by Voyager, excite gases in Triton's atmosphere to create its
auroras, said Andy Chen of Johns Hopkins University.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Tuesday, Voyager will be 2.759 billion miles from
Earth and 4.097 million miles beyond Neptune, slowly decelerating as
it speeds toward the stars at 37,582 mph.
   NASA engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming
Voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in
the coming months, said Lanny Miller, manager of the flight
engineering office.

  The former Communist Party chief in
Kosovo province, Azem Vllasi, and 14 other ethnic Albanians were
charged with counterrevolutionary activities in ethnic unrest there,
Tanjug said Monday.
   If convicted, the 15 could be sentenced to death.
   The state news agency said Vllasi and the others were accused of
trying to destroy fraternity and unity of peoples and nationalities.
   The accused ``created danger for the life of people ... caused
grave violence, imperiled the security and economic strength of the
country, which amounted to posing a counterrevolutionary threat to
the social system,'' Tanjug quoted the indictment as saying .
   Spasoje Zamfirovic, the prosecutor in the town of Titova
Mitrovica, said all 15 organized and supported mass protest meetings
and demonstrations of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in November.
   They also orchestrated a strike by 1,300 miners in a lead and
zinc mine last February, he was quoted as saying.
   At least 23 demonstrators and two policemen were killed in spring
riots in Kosovo after ethnic Albanian miners staged a weeklong
sit-in at the mine to protest constitutional changes giving the
republic of Serbia greater control over Kosovo, an autonomous
province.
   Vllasi was arrested shortly after he talked to the miners. His
lawyers say he tried to persuade them to leave, but his accusers say
he was conspiring with ethnic Albanian separatists who want the
province to become a republic.
   Ethnic Albanians comprise nearly 90 percent of the 1.7-million
people of Kosovo, where Slavs claim they are being harassed by
Albanians.
   The accused are being held at Titova Mitrovica, 130 miles south
of Belgrade.
   Zamfirovic told Tanjug the trial will be held within two months.

<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms pushed streams over their banks and flooded streets
in the Midwest and produced walnut-sized hail in North Dakota on
Monday.
   Strong thunderstorms developed in hot, humid air across northern
Missouri into central Illinois and central Indiana. Rainfall totals
in Indiana included more than 3 inches in Frankfort, nearly 2}
inches in Antioch and 1\ inches in 15 minutes in Sheridan.
   Heavy rains prompted the closure of state Highway 28 in Clinton
County, Ind., and knocked out power in Lafayette, Ind.
   Thunderstorms rumbled across eastern North Dakota ahead of a cold
front Monday morning. Walnut-size hail fell from a severe
thunderstorm near Cooperstown, N.D.
   Thunderstorms also extended along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the
southern Atlantic Coast, with nearly two inches of rain recorded in
Pensacola, Fla. Showers and thunderstorms were scattered in central
Arkansas, New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle and southwest Kansas.
   Hot and very humid weather was common again Monday afternoon
throughout much of the south central and southeast portions of the
nation. Temperatures were in the 90s from Florida and the South
Carolina coast across the Gulf Coast and the lower Mississippi
valley into the southern Plains.
   Temperatures were in the 90s, but with low humidity, across the
desert Southwest.
   The coolest readings were in the northern Rockies, where
temperatures were in the 50s or 60s. Temperatures also were in the
60s along the Pacific coast and from North Dakota into upper
Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54
degrees at Yellowstone, Wyo., and Arcata, Calif., to 101 degrees at
Palm Springs, Calif., and Beeville, Texas. The low in the nation
Monday morning was 30 degrees at Truckee, Calif.
   On Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms are expected from the
eastern half of the Gulf Coast region and Florida to much of the
Atlantic Coast states, as well as from the central Appalachians
across the Great Lakes region, the Ohio Valley, the lower
Mississippi Valley, much of Kansas and the Texas Panhandle into
southeast New Mexico.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 80s across much of
the nation. Highs in the 70s were forecast from Washington state
across the northern Rockies, the northern Plains, the upper
Mississippi Valley and the northern half of the Great Lakes into New
England, as well as along the Pacific Coast.
   Temperatures in the 90s were expected throughout the southern and
central Plateau, the interior valleys of California, and from the
middle and southern Atlantic Coast and Florida across the Gulf
Coast, the western half of the Ohio Valley and the lower Mississippi
Valley into the southern Plains. High temperatures were forecast to
climb between 100 and 110 degrees over the desert Southwest and near
the big bend of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.

   Police on Monday questioned two former Israeli
military officers about reports they trained gunmen for Colombian
cocaine bosses. One said the civilians he trained may have later
been hired by drug lords.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Monday on Army Radio that
Israel will make every effort to prevent Israelis from working as
mercenaries in Latin America, declaring: ``We will do everything in
our power to enforce the law and prevent all aid by Israelis to the
drug cartel.''
   Lt. Col. Yair Klein said in an interview shortly before being
questioned by police that ``the force we trained was so strong that
the drug dealers wanted them for their own, and with the money they
have they probably succeeded.''
   Klein, a former paratrooper who once headed an elite anti-terror
squad, said he regretted getting involved in Colombia even though at
the time he believed he was only training farmers to defend their
cattle against marauding guerrillas.
   ``If I had known who these people were and where they ended up I
wouldn't have done it,'' said Klein.
   Also questioned was reserve Lt. Col. Amatzia Shueli, a former
commando who worked with Klein as a shooting instructor in Colombia.
   Police went to Klein's farmhouse after questioning him for nine
hours and confiscated documents, Israel Radio said.
   Klein and Shueli were asked to leave their passports with police,
it added.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Israel will fully investigate
the affair but added, ``I know our officers, and I cannot believe
that they have been involved in such crimes.''
   In Tel Aviv, Klein said he was no more guilty than other Israelis
who trained paramilitary groups in Latin America.
   ``If I did break the law, a lot of other people did,'' Klein said
on Army Radio as he walked into the criminal affairs division of the
Petah Tikva police station near Tel Aviv.
   Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated
dozens of former officers were involved in training non-government
groups.
   Klein said on Sunday he would name high-ranking officers and a
member of Parliament who were involved in training paramilitary
forces in Latin America. He declined to identify them Monday.
   Yehoshua Saguy, a former chief of military intelligence and now a
parliament member of the right-wing Likud bloc, said on Israel radio
he visited Colombia in 1986 as a representative of an electronics
firm. He said he met with the defense minister but concluded no
deals.
   The newspaper Yediot Ahronot quoted former Maj. Gen. Rahamim
Zeevi as saying he visited Colombia several times on business, but
always had government authorization. Zeevi, who now represents the
Moledet Party in Parliament, once was Klein's commander.
   Klein said he and three other retired Israeli officers held two
three-week weapons courses for civilians starting in April 1988. He
said his Hod Hahanit (Spearhead) company trained groups of 30
farmers and ranchers to defend themselves from guerrillas.
   Hod Hahanit said Israeli Defense Ministry authorization was not
required because he was training civilians.
   Klein said the Colombian army initially encouraged his work, but
that he shut down and fled the country shortly after trying to set
up a third course.
   ``For the third course we saw something was going wrong,'' he
said. ``We were no longer getting ammunition from the army and
officers stopped visiting our training camp.''
   He said he was paid $20,000 a course and each instructor received
$2,000.
   Klein retired from the army in 1978 and founded Hod Hahanit in
1985 after operating a restaurant and then a gas station.
   ``There are officers like me who at the height of their abilities
leave the army and settle on a low-paying pension,'' Klein said.
``Out of frustration with the civilian market they go back to doing
what they do best.''
   Yediot Ahronot said two Israelis were arrested in Miami in June
for trying to ship weapons to Colombia intended to kill the leader
of the Medellin drug cartel.
   U.S. customs authorities identified one as David Candiotti, 27.
They said he reputedly worked for the rival Cali drug cartel and was
involved in a conspiracy to detonate an explosives-packed drone over
the hideout of Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gavaria.
   In Bogota, Colombian Defense Minister Gen. Oscar Botero Restrepo
said in a statement Monday that training there by Israeli
mercenaries was illegal.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo quoted Klein as saying in an
interview that he ignored an Israeli Embassy warning that he may
have been training drug traffickers last year, believing he was
dealing with legitimate ranchers.
   The ranchers also hired mercenaries from South Africa, Zimbabwe,
Ireland and the United States, Klein was quoted as saying.
   Klein's training was reportedly done near Puerto Boyaca.
   Puerto Boyaca, 100 miles north of Bogota, is an area where drug
traffickers have steadily bought up land and where anyone resisting
their efforts has been murdered.

   An 8-year-old cancer victim who died three
days after realizing his dream of becoming a soldier was buried in
his camouflage fatigues Monday.
   Chris Riley, inducted into the Army as a ``special soldier'' by
recruiting officials, died Sunday night in the arms of his father,

weeks or three, the doctor couldn't tell us for sure.''
   The youth had undergone surgery twice since November 1986 for a
brain tumor. Chemotherapy was stopped last month after the cancer
spread to his spine, leaving him in pain and too weak to walk, said
his mother, Gail Riley.
   The staff of Army's Fairmont recruiting office organized
Thursday's induction after a family friend suggested a visit from a
couple of soldiers might cheer Chris.
   Army Capt. Duane Hawn and 1st Sgt. Gary Johnson prepared an
enlistment certificate and Chris was sworn in as a special soldier.
Members of the Pittsburgh Recruiting Battalion sent a four-man color
guard and a stuffed bear wearing a camouflage suit.
   Chris, wearing a camouflage uniform with a black military police
armband and RILEY stitched above his right pocket, was given a
10-minute ride aboard a National Guard self-propelled howitzer a
couple of blocks from his home in northern West Virginia.
   That afternoon, Chris, riding on a stretcher, was taken up on a
flight aboard an Army Reserve Huey helicopter.
   ``He loved it,'' Cottrill said. ``In fact, (Saturday) he wanted
to go and buy a G.I. Joe toy `right now.'''
   Following services at Domico Funeral Home here, Chris was buried
at nearby Shinnston Masonic Cemetery in the same camouflage fatigues
he wore Thursday.

   Gerard Mortier, director of the Brussels
Opera, was named artistic director of the Salzburg Festival on
Monday with a mandate to revamp a cultural showcase some critics say
is elitist and conservative.
   His appointment follows the July 16 death of Herbert von Karajan,
the longtime guiding spirit and conductor of the festival who died
of a heart attack at age 81.
   The board of the festival announced that Mortier, 46, will take
over at Salzburg on Oct. 1, 1991. But starting next month he will
help plan festival events to be held after 1991, the Austria Press
Agency reported.
   In another appointment, the board named Hans Landesmann, a music
manager in Vienna, as the festival's economic director.
   ``The festival has become an old museum, unaware of what's going
on in the world. We should give modern music and drama the place
they deserve,'' Landesmann said in an interview.
   For years, critics said tickets to the Salzburg Festival cost too
much, and that proceedings were too much under the sway of Karajan.
   Austrian cultural politicians now are trying to open the
69-year-old festival to new forms of art and invite a greater
variety of musicians.
   Under a plan outlined in June, the unpaid, honorary five-man
board of the festival will be replaced by a permanent, salaried
three-member board.
   ``We need new, forward-thinking people in the management, much
more aware of the contemporary scene,'' said Landesmann, who is to
draw up a reform program.
   Landesmann said he would like to include artists on a new board
to advise on projects.
   He said he would also like to see film and video galas and
exhibits during the festival.
   While not playing down the merits of Italian traditional operas
here every year, Landesmann proposes to include other composers,
such as Richard Strauss and Alban Berg.
   There is also talk among festival organizers of devoting the
2,600-seat Great Festival Hall to foreign classical opera and the
Little Festival Hall to Mozart productions.
   ``We want a repertoire consistent with the line of Mozart's
heritage, something specific, typical of Salzburg,'' Landesmann said.
   In an attempt to prevent the rise of another domineering figure
such as Karajan, he said, no permanent conductor will be named.
Invitations will go out to well-known figures such as Sir Georg
Solti, Riccardo Muti and Claudio Abbado, all of whom are present
this summer.
   ``Karajan was opposed to reforms. He was an old man and he didn't
like changes. He was opposed to seeing new people,'' Landesmann said.
   Five years ago, government auditors had urged festival organizers
to spend less.
   Press chief Hans Widrich said the festival runs an annual budget
of $27 million. State subsidies total $7.7 million and the rest
comes from ticket sales, radio and television rights.
   Salzburg pays some of the highest performer fees in Europe and
charges nearly twice the top ticket prices of other European
festivals _ up to $250 for the best seat at the opera.

   The Nicaraguan Navy has seized two U.S.-owned
fishing vessels for lack of proper documentation and is detaining
the vessels and their crews at the port of Bluefields, the State
Department said Monday.
   The vessels, carrying a total of eight crewmen, were identified

<HEAD>`Uncle Buck' Continues to Lead Box Office; `Wired' Dead on Arrival</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The controversy surrounding ``Wired'' didn't
help it at the box office, as John Belushi's cinematic life story
opened to miserable weekend business while ``Uncle Buck'' again held
down the top spot.
   ``Uncle Buck,'' a comedy starring John Candy as an obnoxious
relative sent to babysit two nieces and a nephew, collected $6.7
million to lead the charts for the second week in a row, according
to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   It was followed in second by ``Parenthood,'' the bittersweet
chronicle of family life featuring Steve Martin and Jason Robards,
which netted $6.4 million. The $43 million underwater adventure film
``The Abyss'' finished in third with receipts of $4.7 million.
   ``Wired,'' an unusual parable of drug addiction showing the late
Belushi revisiting his life after escaping from a coroner's body
bag, grossed just $681,000 while playing on 680 screens.
   With such a stunningly low per-screen average, ``Wired'' is
certain to disappear from theaters quickly and it likely will debut
in home video stores soon. The movie drew steeply negative reviews
and had difficulty finding a distributor partly due to its subject
matter.
   In fourth place after ``The Abyss'' was the romantic comedy
``When Harry Met Sally...,'' with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as
friends who become lovers, on ticket sales of $4.1 million. ``Lethal
Weapon 2,'' starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, was in fifth with
$3.3 million.
   The drooling dog-cop buddy picture ``Turner and Hooch'' finished
in sixth with a gross of $3 million. ``Casualties of War,'' which
opened poorly last weekend, fell to seventh with a gate of $2.9
million.
   Still showing in the charts after 10 weeks of release, ``Batman''
landed in eighth by collecting $2.6 million. Rounding out the Top 10
were ``The Package,'' debuting in ninth with $1.9 million in limited
release, and ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' with $1.7 million in 10th.
   In other box-office news, ``Little Monsters'' and ``The
Adventures of Milo and Otis'' opened weakly while ``Cookie'' did
fair business its first week out.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Uncle Buck,'' Universal, $6.7 million, 1,835 screens, $3,665
per screen, $23.7 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Parenthood,'' Universal, $6.4 million, 1,384 screens, $4,610
per screen, $53.7 million, four weeks.
   3. ``The Abyss,'' 20th Century Fox, $4.7 million, 1,525 screens,
$3,105 per screen, $33 million, three weeks.
   4. ``When Harry Met Sally...,'' Columbia, $4.1 million, 1,171
screens, $3,464 per screen, $60.7 million, seven weeks.
   5. ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' Warner Bros., $3.3 million, 1,560
screens, $2,138 per screen, $125.1 million, eight weeks.
   6. ``Turner and Hooch,'' Disney, $3 million, 1,551 screens,

   French and Soviet envoys held talks Monday
with Iraqi and Syrian officials amid renewed international efforts
to stop the bloodshed in Lebanon, where nearly 800 people have been
killed in five months.
   Francois Scheer, secretary-general of the French Foreign
Ministry, met for four hours with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa. Syrian soldiers are battling Christian troops in Lebanon.
   ``Any solution in Lebanon must be a political one and no
political solution in Lebanon is possible without an effective
Syrian contribution,'' Scheer said after the meeting.``The French
position on Lebanon has not changed and our action is absolutely an
action of peace.''
   Later, the Frenchman met with Syrian President Hafez Assad at his
summer residence in the Mediterranean port of Lattakis and gave him
a message from French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Assad asked Scheer to deliver a reply to the French president,
said a Syrian official who refused to give details.
   Syrian-backed Moslem groups accuse France of supporting Lebanese
Christians and have threatened retaliation if a French naval task
force in the eastern Mediterranean intervenes in Lebanon, which
France governed until 1943.
   France says the flotilla is on a ``humanitarian'' mission, to
evacuate the 7,000 French citizens in Lebanon if necessary.
   Scheer's visit was the second to the Middle East this week by a
French envoy seeking a lasting truce in the battle that began March
8 between the Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and a Moslem
alliance led by Syria's 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon.
   At least 790 people have been killed and more than 2,000 wounded
in the fighting. All but 150,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million residents
have fled the city.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France announced Sunday that
Scheer will confer with a three-member Arab League committee trying
to implement a cease-fire and end the 14-year-old civil war.
   The committee members _ King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia and President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria _ agreed at
an Arab summit in May to try to arrange peace in Lebanon by November.
   Syrian soldiers arrived in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate in 1976, a year after the beginning of the
sectarian civil war in which at least 150,000 people have been
killed.
   Scheer said Monday: ``We also support other efforts, namely by
the Soviet Union, and we wish very much that the mission of the Arab
tripartite committee, which has our full support, resumes as quickly
as possible.''
   A three-step peace plan outlined by Dumas calls for a cease-fire,
no more arms deliveries to the warring factions, political reform in
Lebanon and withdrawal of Syrian and Israeli forces from the
country, with Syrian departure from Beirut as the first step.
   Israel maintains a south Lebanon ``security zone'' just north of
its border.
   Gennady Tarasov, head of the Middle East desk at the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, was in Baghdad on Monday to meet with Tariq Aziz,
the Iraqi foreign minister. Tarasov has visited Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon for consultations on how to end the fighting.
   Iraq, an enemy of Syria, has been the main arms supplier to Aoun.
Syria is the Soviet Union's main Arab ally, but the Kremlin also
maintains relations with Iraq.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Tarasov gave Aziz a letter
from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for Iraq's president, Saddam
Hussein.
   Foreign ministers of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council on
Monday began a two-day meeting in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, with an
appeal to all factions in Lebanon to help the Arab League peace
effort. Member nations are Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and The United Arab Emirates.

   Rabbi Moshe Levinger, a founder of the Jewish
settlement movement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, went
on trial Monday on charges he killed a Palestinian shopkeeper in
September 1988.
   Also Monday, three Palestinians died of gunshot wounds suffered
in clashes with Israeli forces and a fourth was beaten to death by
fellow Arabs who accused him of collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   Thirteen Palestinians were shot and wounded with plastic bullets
in stone-throwing clashes with troops in three Gaza Strip refugee
camps, Arab hospital officials said.
   The shooting deaths raised the toll to 553 Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians in the 20-month uprising. Ninety-nine
Palestinians have been reported slain by fellow Arabs as alleged
collaborators during the revolt, and 38 Israelis have been killed.
   Levinger, spiritual leader of the settler movement Gush Emunim,
or Bloc of the Faithful, pleaded innocent to manslaughter charges in
the death of Kayed Salah, 42, in the West Bank town of Hebron on
Sept. 30.
   Levinger has said he fired in the air to defend himself against a
stoning attack on his car. The indictment charges he returned to the
stoning scene and opened fire at a distance of 12 yards after
reporting the incident to soldiers. Judge Ezra Hadaya dismissed an
attempt by Levinger's attorney to base his defense on an assertion
the government was not doing enough to defend Jews from Arab attacks.
   ``We conduct our trials only according to relevant facts,''
Hadaya said.
   The private Israeli Information Center for Human Rights says 23
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli civilians in the uprising.
One Israeli has been convicted in the cases.
   Before the 30-minute proceedings, Levinger and a group of
supporters demonstrated outside the home of Palestinian activist
Faisal Husseini, screaming he should be detained as ``the biggest
terrorist'' in the West Bank.
   During the protest, Levinger handed Husseini a copy of a fake
identity card giving his occupation as ``terrorist.''
   Husseini was freed by the government in January after spending
most of the preceding 20 months in jail. He was held without charge
or trial.
   Also Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
criticized Israel's latest round of deportations of Palestinians
accused of leading the uprising. Israel deported five Palestinians
on Sunday, four to Lebanon and one to France.
   Perez de Cuellar ``once again appeals to Israel as the occupying
power to rescind such deportation orders and to abide by its
obligations'' under international law, a statement said.
   The Palestinian deaths reported Monday included 21-year-old
Bassel Khaled Suleiman of Beit Safafa in Jerusalem and 20-year-old
Ali Mahmoud Shaban from Jabaliya refugee camp in the occupied Gaza
Strip.
   Suleiman was wounded when police opened fire on masked youths who
blocked a main road in Beit Safafa on Sunday night and pelted police
with stones, said Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori.
   Doctors at Mukassed Hospital in Arab east Jerusalem said he died
later of two plastic bullet wounds to the chest.
   The third Palestinian killed was Jamal Abu Sfakeh, a 58-year-old
Tulkaram resident who arrived dead at the town hospital, Arab
reports said.
   The Army said soldiers shot Abu Sfakeh when he attacked them with
a metal crowbar. Tulkaram was placed under curfew, an army spokesman
said.
   Shaban died in Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital of wounds suffered
Friday, the army said.
   The army said he was masked with an Arab keffiyeh scarf when he
was shot while ``interfering with army operations.'' The Jerusalem
Post daily said he was going from door to door collecting
Israeli-issued identity cards. Israel recently began requiring
Palestinians to carry the cards.
   Also Monday, 60-year-old Rajeb Al Kassas died of injuries
suffered three days earlier when he was beaten by masked youths who
accused him of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab reports
said.
   The army confirmed the death in the West Bank town of Nablus and
said police were investigating.

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 admirers and friends of Huey
P. Newton, including former comrades Bobby Seale and H. Rap Brown,
overflowed a church for the slain Black Panther co-founder's funeral
Monday.
   ``Huey Newton was a hero,'' said Elaine Brown, chairwoman of the
Black Panther Party from 1974-77. ``I think that's how we have to
leave here today _ thinking of him as a hero. A hero who sparked
hope into runaway slaves.''
   ``I really believed Huey was invincible,'' Brown told the
mourners, many of whom wiped away tears. ``I really believed he
would live to fight another day. And as I look out and see you
gathered today, I believe he is invincible.''
   Newton, 47, was killed early Aug. 22 in the poor West Oakland
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years
ago. Police said Newton died in a dispute over crack cocaine.
   Tyrone Robinson, 25, a reputed prison gang member who police say
has admitted killing Newton, was being held without bail awaiting
his arraignment, scheduled later Monday, on a homicide charge.
   The 1,200 seats in the Allen Temple Baptist Church were full,
while hundreds who couldn't squeeze in milled about outside during
the three-hour funeral, which was disrupted by a half-hour power
failure blamed on a car striking a power pole.
   On Sunday, about 6,000 people filed through an Oakland funeral
home to view Newton's body, which was buried privately later Monday.
   The mourners _ whose dress ranged from somber street clothes to
dashikis and black berets _ included members of Newton's family,
friends, and fellow radicals from the 1960s and '70s, when the Black
Panthers espoused the cause of black liberation and ``the power of
the gun'' against white authority.
   Among those on hand were Bobby Seale, 52, the Panthers' other
founder, and H. Rap Brown, leader of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee.
   ``We're here to celebrate his life, not to discuss his death,''
Brown, who now works for a Los Angeles lawyer, said shortly before
the funeral. ``We don't need counter-revolutionary fratricide. He'll
be remembered as a hero.''
   Newton founded the Black Panther Party with Seale in Oakland in
1966. As the party's minister of defense and chief ideologue, he
became one of the most articulate leaders of the black militancy
movement.
   Johnny Spain, a former Black Panther who last Tuesday won a new
trial in the 1971 killings of two prison guards, told the
congregation Newton's death highlights problems still facing the
black community.
   ``After the dust clears and next week little kids say `Huey who,'
remember that in someone's community ... a human being was gunned
down and that should serve as a notice that there's a lot of work to
do,'' said Spain, 40.

   The former interior minister may get 20 years
in the Cuban drug and corruption scandal and six ministry officials
face prison terms ranging up to 15 years, Fidel Castro's government
said Monday.
   Prosecutors requested the sentences Sunday after four days of
testimony to a military tribunal, the official Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina reported from Havana. It did not say when verdicts and
sentences were expected.
   Ministry officials for whom prosecutors asked sentences of 8 to
15 years include the former vice interior minister and the former
head of customs, the agency said.
   Gen. Jose Abrantes Fernandez, the former interior minister, and
his co-defendants were accused of using their posts to enrich
themselves.
   Prensa Latina said prosecutors asked that Abrantes and at least
four other defendants be reduced in rank to private and that all
their illegal gains be confiscated. It quoted a report Monday in
Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party.
   The trial is the latest chapter in a scandal that has resulted in
the executions of four officers, including a highly decorated
general who had been with Castro since guerrilla days more than 30
years ago.
   Castro fired Abrantes as interior minister in June, when 12
military officers from the ministry and two from the army were
charged with drug smuggling and other crimes. All were convicted and
the 10 not executed are serving prison terms of up to 30 years.
   Prosecutors said Abrantes fumbled the drug-smuggling
investigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate, but
that the evidence did not support a charge of treason, Prensa Latina
reported.
   Abrantes knew as early as February that officials of his ministry
were involved in drug trafficking but did nothing about it, the
prosecution said.
   According to Prensa Latina, Castro personally ordered Abrantes to
investigate after persistent reports that tons of Colombian cocaine
and Jamaican marijuana were moving through Cuba to the United States.
   Abrantes was charged with abusing power, neglecting his duties
and stealing from the government, the agency said.
   It said prosecutors asked the tribunal to send the former vice
interior minister, Gen. Pascual Martinez Gil, to prison for 15 years
and requested a 13-year term for Lt. Col. Oscar Carreno Gomez, the
former customs chief.
   Abrantes, Carreno Gomez and four others are accused of taking
money from some of the officers arrested in June. Prensa Latina said
Abrantes allegedly accumulated millions of dollars in an illegal
fund.
   The prosecution said Abrantes had a long, close relationship with
Col. Antonio de la Guardia, one of the officers executed. In
addition to drug charges, those arrested in June were accused of
crimes ranging from diamond smuggling to black marketeering.
   Prensa Latina said Abrantes was accused of various illegal
financial dealings and diverting ministry funds and resources to
personal use.
   Felipe Aleman Cruz, the chief prosecutor, said Abrantes was so
consumed with ``dollar fever'' that he traded in Cuban pesos on the
black market for his own profit.
   Cuban media have given the corruption scandal an unusual amount
of coverage and Prensa Latina has sent dispatches around the world.

   A Contra rebel director returned from
six years' exile Monday saying he will join the political fight
against the leftist Sandinista government, but that armed struggle
remains an option.
   Roberto Ferrey is the second member of the Contra leadership to
return to Nicaragua in recent months. On arrival, he had to sign a
document saying he renounced armed struggle,
   ``I'm here to incorporate myself into the electoral process,''
Ferrey said, referring to general elections scheduled Feb. 25, 1990.
   Asked if this means he has given up armed struggle to fight the
government, Ferrey said: ``If the changes don't come about, it
(armed struggle) could still be an option.''
   President Daniel Ortega's government has signed regional accords
committing itself to democratic changes.
   In the latest accord, signed Aug. 7, the presidents of Nicaragua,
Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Guatemala agreed to dismantle
the Nicaraguan rebel force known as the Contras starting Sept. 5.
   The process, under the supervision of observers from the United
Nations and the Organization of American States, should be completed
Dec. 6.
   Most Contras, an estimated 10,000 with another 10,000 family
members, have been living in Honduras since their leaders and the
Sandinistas signed a temporary cease-fire in March 1988.
   Ferrey said ``there is no need to resign'' from the directorate
of the Miami-based Nicaraguan Resistance, an umbrella organization
of anti-Sandinista groups in exile.
   He arrived aboard a private flight from Guatemala City provided
by Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Alfredo Cesar was the first directorate member to return to
Nicaragua. he came home on June 11 and joined his old party, the
Social Democrats, but still has not said whether he has resigned
from the directorate.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said nine officers were hurt in
bottle-throwing clashes Monday night at Notting Hill Carnival,
marring an otherwise peaceful Carribbean celebration in which crime
was sharply down from previous years.
   Police reported 47 crimes in the Sunday and Monday event,
compared with 85 last year.
   But as the carnival drew to a close, some police were hit by
bottles and officers moved in to clear streets.
   ``A number of arrests have been made and there have been a few
minor injuries to the police,'' a police spokesman said.
   Deputy Assistant Commissioner Charles Rideout of Scotland Yard
later said nine officers were hurt, and the violence had spread to
other streets.
   ``This is a most unfortunate incident ... on a day we thought was
going to be one of the best carnival days ever,'' he said.
   Police estimated 300,000 people were on the streets of the
Notting Hill area of west London on Monday. On Sunday there were
200,000, about 15 to 20 percent fewer than in past years, they said.
   About 1,000 officers patrolled the carnival and 4,000 more were
on call, Rideout said.
   The carnival, held on the August bank holiday weekend, features
parades, colorful costumes, street performers and a jubilant
Afro-Caribbean atmosphere that has become a cultural focal point for
London's black community.
   Riots, muggings and other violence, including a fatal 1987
stabbing, have marred past carnivals _ billed as Europe's largest
street festival _ and led to calls for it to be banned.
   A new Carnival Enterprise Committee was formed this year to
organize the 24th annual event and to put the emphasis back on
traditional parades, dances and ethnic food stands.

   State officials Monday agreed to fight
deportation of a 9-year-old Bangladeshi girl who was molested by the
man who brought her to America, then taken from a foster home
because it wasn't ``culturally relevant.''
   Earlier, the girl's foster parents and more than 200 supporters
fighting her removal and possible deportation marched on the state
capitol, chanting and waving banners demanding help for the
youngster they call ``Kushi Bear.''
   The girl is one of several members of a Bangladeshi family that
Stefan Christopher, 52, brought to this country. A U.N. consultant,
he had married one of the girl's older sisters, separated from her
and married another sister, age 12. Over the years he brought family
members to work on his Oakville farm.
   Christopher is in jail awaiting sentencing Sept. 5 after pleading
guilty to taking indecent liberties with the girl and two other
children. Sheriff's department officials said he subjected them to
``physical and psychological torture.''
   After Monday's rally, the state Child Protective Services said it
would review the case and fight deportation. Spokeswoman Irene
Hopman said an education visa would be sought for Kushi, allowing
her to remain in the United States indefinitely.
   But Ms. Hopman insisted that the child could not remain with her
foster parents, chemical engineer Bob Martin and his wife, Betsy
Seidel, an English teacher.
   ``She is not adoptable. She had been raised a Moslem. That is her
family's religion,'' Ms. Hopman said. ``The girl's birth parents
want her educated and raised in the United States but their sect
does not believe in adoption and they have not relinquished their
rights.''
   Martin and Seidel wept when they were surrounded by supporters
after hearing the news. They had feared the state would allow Kushi
to be sent back to Bangladesh where she would be outcast because of
the sexual abuse.
   ``Kushi has a magic that touches everyone,'' Martin told the
rally. ``Betsy and I did everything we could within the system but
it wasn't enough. Removing Kushi was wrong, just wrong.''
   CPS workers took Khurshida ``Kushi'' Begum from the Martin-Seidel
home at Hoquiam near the Pacific Ocean last Friday, declaring it
wasn't ``culturally relevant.''
   The girl has been placed temporarily with her 19-year-old sister
Morshida here, whose marriage gave Kushi entry to the United States.
The girl faces deportation when her visa expires Sept. 5.
   If the placement with her sister doesn't work out, three Moslem
families have volunteered their homes, Ms. Hopman said.
   Morshida, mother of two children, has filed for divorce from
Christopher, 52, whom she married when she was 12.
   Supporters say if the child were returned to her remote village
she would face life as a social outcast because of her sexual abuse.
   Shah Asadullah, a Bangladeshi psychiatrist with Group Health
Medical Center in Seattle, wrote in a letter to CPS that if she is
deported she ``is likely to become completely outcast and walk the
streets to survive.''
   ``I am shocked by the sudden removal of the child,'' said lawyer
Janet Watson, who represents Martin and Seidel in their effort to
adopt the girl. ``I've never heard of a child being removed by the
state from an excellent home against the wishes of the child.''
   The girl said, ``I want to live with them, because they love me
and they're nice.''
   A 16-year-old cousin of Kushi's committed suicide last year after
being abused, leading to the sheriff's investigation and removal of
the children, the sheriff's office said.
   State officials said they have been unable to directly contact
the illiterate parents in Bangladesh. Three letters have not been
answered, said Ms. Hopman.
   She said efforts to reach them will be stepped up, and that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service will be asked to provide an
education visa, which would allow her to remain in the United States
until her education is completed.
   But Kushi's brother, Sultan, 21, who lives in Seattle, said in an
interview that Kushi's parents don't mind if their daughter stays
with Martin and Seidel.
   ``I write them and they say it's O.K. They don't know about this
adoption. This country is very hard. My parents can't understand,''
he said.
   ``They said it's OK if she happy. If she goes to school. They
poor. They don't have nothing. That's why it's OK.''

   A wounded Canadian fugitive being airlifted
by a medical helicopter apparently tried to commandeer the aircraft
in flight, causing it to crash and killing him and the three-member
crew, authorities said Monday.
   The bodies of Robert L. Adams, 25, and the crew of the Heartflite
helicopter were found Monday on Larch Mountain 25 miles northeast of
Spokane, said Kootenai County sheriff's Sgt. Kenneth Sopher.
   The crew _ the pilot, a registered nurse and a respiratory
therapist _ reported that Adams was scuffling with them before the
Aerospatiale Astar from Sacred Heart Medical Center here crashed
around 10 p.m. Sunday.
   Adams apparently tried to enter the United States illegally near
a U.S. Customs station in Eastport, Idaho, on Sunday night, the
Boundary County Sheriff's Department said in a news release.
   The Bridgefield, Nova Scotia, man was wanted in Canada for
investigation of escape, sexual assault and auto theft charges.
   During a search of a vehicle at the Customs station, a man pulled
a weapon and disarmed Director Joe Hancock, agency spokeswoman
Cherise Miles said in Chicago. The man then fled south on U.S. 25.
The vehicle had been stolen.
   Adams forced his way into the nearby home of Bob McGlocklin, 71,
and briefly held the man hostage, the sheriff's department said. The
two men were wounded in an exchange of gunfire, but the sequence of
events was unclear.
   Two Heartflite helicopters were dispatched to Bonners Ferry,
Idaho, about 20 miles south of Eastport to pick up Adams and
McGlocklin.
   One picked up McGlocklin and returned to Spokane. The second
aircraft left Bonners Ferry at 9:26 p.m., and made a routine patient
report 30 minutes later, but was not heard from again, said Sacred
Heart spokeswoman Marilyn Thordarson.
   Bob Zinkgraf, who was listening with his wife to a radio scanner
at his Colbert, Wash., home 15 miles north of Spokane, said the crew
``reported they were having problems with the suspect.''
   ``A couple of minutes later, they reported they were in a scuffle
with the suspect. Then we heard the hospital trying to get in touch
with them. They reported they lost contact with the helicopter''
about 10 p.m., Zinkgraf said.
   Ms. Thordarson said the last report made no mention of any
difficulty, and that only static and background noises were heard
afterwards.
   The crash is being investigated as a crime rather than as an
accident, said air safety inspector Pete Mangum of the National
Transportation Safety Board's Seattle office.
   The spokeswoman identified the dead as pilot Pat Varaya, age
unknown, registered nurse Lyn Gould, 31, and respiratory therapist
Bob Siekerman, 36, all from the Spokane area.
   McGlocklin was in satisfactory condition at Sacred Heart with
gunshot wounds to his right arm and back, Ms. Thordarson said.
   The Bonner County Sheriff's office is investigating the accident,
as well as the Federal Aviation Administration, and the FBI has been
asked to join the probe, officials said.

<HEAD>Avanti Convertibles Exempted From Passive Restraint Requirement</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Adds 3 grafs comment from Nader group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Avanti Automotive Corp. won a two-year reprieve
Monday from having to install air bags or motorized seat belts in
its convertibles.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it
granted an exemption from passive restraint requirements because
complying would cause ``substantial economic hardship'' for the
struggling car company.
   Avanti's passive restraint exemption is the only one granted for
1990 model-year cars, NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd said.
   The company's hard-top models still must comply with the passive
restraint requirement.
   In seeking the exemption, Avanti noted its importance to
Youngstown, Ohio, a once-thriving steel center now racked with high
unemployment.
   ``Avanti affords job opportunities to an economically depressed
area, its payroll approximately $250,000 a month. Other jobs have
been created by suppliers to Avanti,'' said the notice published in
the Federal Register.
   The company, which employs about 190 workers, was given $8
million worth of incentives to bring its plant to Youngstown.
   Avanti said it lost $2 million between June 1, 1988, and Nov. 30,
1988, the most recent financial statements made available to NHTSA.
   The company, which intends to produce about 200 convertibles a
year, had asked for a three-year exemption.
   NHTSA said it would consider extending the exemption, if
necessary, but wanted to take into account whether the company
follows through with interim plans to make a combination roll
bar-automatic seat belt, to be sold as optional equipment for the
convertibles, which sell for a base price of $47,982.
   ``It's just one of those decisions that is so dumb it speaks for
itself,'' said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto
Safety. ``We feel that air bags are such an important life-saving
technology that there shouldn't be any exemptions from the
standard.''
   Ditlow, of the non-profit organization founded by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader, said the company should have been required to
buy air bag technology from another manufacturer.
   ``Avanti has known for five years now _ six years actually _ that
they have to meet the standard,'' he said. ``Consumers shouldn't buy
the car. There are other convertibles out there with air bags.''

<HEAD>Judge Eliminates Occidental Defense in Love Canal Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has eliminated one of
Occidental Chemical Corp.'s main defenses in a lawsuit over
liability for cleaning up the infamous Love Canal toxic dump,
according to a decision made public Monday.
   U.S. District Judge John Curtin, ruling in a lawsuit filed by the
state, rejected Occidental's claim that the company had relinquished
liability when it sold the Love Canal land to the Niagara Falls
school board.
   Occidental, owner of the former Hooker Chemical and Plastic Co.
that used Love Canal as a waste dump, contended it wasn't
responsible for the site after 1953, when it sold the land on which
a school was subsequently built.
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams said the ruling was ``a
great victory for the state.''
   ``It lays to rest Occidental's principal defense that selling the
landfill to a school district relieved the company of its
responsibility for the harmful health effects caused by Occidental's
dumping on the land,'' he said.
   Occidental actually ``palmed off what it knew to be an enormous
toxic waste site for $1,'' the attorney general said.
   Curtin, in a judgment dated Friday, also extended Occidental's
liability for the cost of cleaning up Love Canal to include
liability under the state's nuisance law. Last year, Curtin said the
company was liable under the federal Superfund law.
   Some estimates on the cost of cleaning up Love Canal, where
Occidental acknowledges that 20,000 tons of chemical wastes were
dumped in the 1940s and 1950s, exceed $250 million.
   New York state is one of several parties, including the federal
government and former area residents, suing Occidental over Love
Canal.
   ``We just received the court's decision late this afternoon and
have not yet had the chance to review it,'' said Occidental
spokesman John Stuart. ``However, given the court's previous summary
judgment ruling against Occidental in February 1988 on the question
of liability under Superfund, this decision is not completely
unexpected.''
   In 1978, Love Canal became synonymous with environmental disaster
when state officials ordered an evaculation of children and pregnant
women from the area because of leaking chemicals.
   President Carter designated the 10-block site as a federal
emergency area in 1978, and the federal Environmental Protection
Agency began a lawsuit against the company the following year.
   Other issues involving Occidental's liability and damages will
probably be the subject of future trials. Curtin has deliberated the
case for 10 years.

   A private charter plane missed a runway and
crashed in a field while attempting an instrument landing in thick
fog early Monday, killing all five people on board.
   Three airplane mechanics for USAir Express-Henson Aviation Inc.
had chartered the Bayland Aviation flight from Salisbury, Md., to
Lynchburg where they planned to work on a passenger jet that was
having mechanical problems, USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said.
   The Piper 31 missed the runway by a quarter-mile and sheared
through trees in a wooded area before crashing in a corn field, said
police Cmdr. S.K. Newby.
   ``It was torn all to pieces,'' Newby said of the plane.
   The National Weather Service said the area was enshrouded in
patchy fog at the time, but it was unclear whether the fog
contributed to the crash.
   ``The plane was trying to attempt a visual approach and broke off
the approach,'' Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred
Farrar said. ``They then requested an instrument landing system
approach to the airport.''
   Bayland Aviation manager Dave Bush said National Transportation
Safety Board investigators would attempt to determine the cause of
the crash.
   The victims were identified as pilot Kenneth Forbes, 30, of
Salisbury; co-pilot William Bowen, 36, of Snow Hill, Md.; and
mechanics Dean A. Witmer, 35, Patrick G. Aragon, 32, and William J.
Neuman, 24, all of Salisbury.
   Forbes had been with Bayland for five years and had been flying
for the past year and a half, Bush said.

<HEAD>Bus Accordions into Rear of Truck; More than 40 Hurt, 10 Seriously</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greyhound bus heading cross-country
crashed into the rear of an equipment-laden truck on Interstate 10,
injuring all 44 aboard the bus and the truck's owner, at least 10
seriously, authorities said Monday.
   Several feet of the front of the bus ``just accordioned
backwards'' after the accident late Sunday night on a steep stretch
about four miles west of Benson, said Dr. Michael Gray, chief of
staff at Benson Hospital.
   ``I was awakened by a huge bang,'' said George Duran, 25, on his
way home to San Diego. ``People were just lying everywhere,
screaming and yelling. There was blood everywhere.''
   A paramedic said it took rescuers nearly an hour to free the
driver and two women from the crushed front of the bus.
   All passengers as well as the drivers of both vehicles were
evacuated by helicopter and ambulance to hospitals in Benson or
Tucson, authorities said.
   Many of the passengers had to be rescued through windows of the
bus, which lacks a rear emergency exit door, officials said.
   The bus was traveling at 60 to 65 mph when it plowed into a
18-wheel flatbed semi-trailer hauling large metal containers at
11:25 p.m., said Richard Pittman, a spokesman for the state
Department of Public Safety. The trucking rig was climbing uphill at
about 25 miles an hour toward Tucson.
   Among the hospitalized were Margo Romero, 21, of Houston, five or
six months pregnant, and her four small children, including a
2{-year-old son, Bill, who was in critical condition after surgery
for a skull fracture.
   Also hospitalized were Jerry Henson, 49, of Phoenix, the bus
driver, who suffered an amputated leg, and Maria Turrubiartes, 40,
of Santa Paula, Calif.
   DPS dispatcher Jerry Stiles said the bus had skidded about 250
feet, indicating Henson had tried to brake before the collision.
   Bruce Whitehouse, fire chief and paramedic of the small Corona de
Tucson fire department, said ``it was a gory scene'' as he arrived.
   ``People were yelling, `Help me! Help me!' A woman told me she
saw her baby go under four rows of seats,'' he said.
   Pittman said both drivers had been within legal limits and added
that the bus driver should have had about a three-fourths of a mile
line of sight of the truck ahead.
   But Pittman said investigators were waiting to talk to Henson to
determine whether he had attempted to change lanes before the
accident.
   He said it was unclear whether lights on the trailer had been in
operation, as required by law.
   The truck's driver, Ricky Middleton, 27, of Houston, told DPS
investigators he was making his first cross-country run at the time.
Investigators were checking to make certain that Middleton was
qualified to be driving the rig, Pittman said.
   Middleton was unhurt, but his father, James Middleton, 58, of
Houston, was listed in guarded condition at Tucson Medical Center.
The elder Middleton was thrown from the truck.
   Two military helicopters shuttled the most seriously injured
passengers from Benson Hospital or directly from the crash site to
trauma centers at Tucson Medical Center and University Medical
Center in Tucson.
   George Gravley, a spokesman for Greyhound Lines Inc. of Dallas,
said there were nine children under 12 among the 43 bus passengers.
Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Hale, also in Dallas, said the driver had
24 years of commercial driving experience, including 22 with buses.
   Gravley said the bus was on a transcontinental run from New York
to Los Angeles.

   Some parents in the Washington suburbs
of Prince George's County on Monday voiced dismay and criticized
parents who own firearms following a weekend incident in which four
juveniles playing ``Rambo'' fired at passing cars on Interstate 95.
   One motorist was slightly injured in an earlier incident.
   ``We're a very close-knit neighborhood,'' said Kelly Stein, a
resident of Temple Hills. ``We keep an eye on our children and we
don't have much in the way of crime or vandalism ... it was very
scary.''
   Another mother in the area said the incident should warn parents
to keep their weapons away from youngsters.
   ``I hope that it'll open eyes to parents to know where your kids
are,'' said Lauren Chambers. ``If you have guns, lock them up.''
   Four youths ranging from age 9 to 14 were caught Saturday night
by Maryland State Police after citizens reported hearing gunfire
near the highway. Police sent a helicopter and several patrols to
the area to investigate and a 14-year-old youth shot at the
helicopter prior to his capture, officials said.
   State police spokesman Chuck Jackson said only two of the youths
were charged.
   Those two appeared in juvenile court in Upper Marlboro on Monday.
The results of the proceedings were not made public. However,
Christine Plater, spokeswoman for Maryland Juvenile Services, said
the 14-year-old, from La Plata, was the only youth placed in the
custody of her office, but Monday was returned to the custody of his
parents by the court. Jackson said an 11-year-old, from Temple
Hills, was released to his parents Saturday..
   The 9-year-old and his 12-year-old brother, both of Temple Hills,
were released to their parents without being charged.
   The names of the youths have not been released because of their
ages.
   Two .22-caliber rifles were recovered, Jackson said.
   Jackson said police believe both rifles belonged to the
14-year-old's uncle, a gun collector who kept numerous weapons in
the attic of his La Plata home.
   The shootings apparently began Aug. 18 when the youths were
playing war games and pretending to be Rambo, the fictional
mercenary played in several movies by Sylvester Stallone, said state
police Detective John Wooters.
   James Orchard of Lusby was injured when a bullet pierced his
windshield and struck his shoulder. Orchard drove to the Forestville
police barrack to report the incident and then was treated at
Andrews Air Force Base.
   Three other cars were hit that evening, and the area has been
under surveillance since then, Jackson said.
   Several shots were fired into the pool area of the Temple Hills
Swim Club and at street lights nearby, said manager Gina E. Magnani,
who was in the office. No one was injured.
   Magnani reported seeing two youths wearing camouflage military
uniforms ``sneaking through the grass shooting.''

   He listed three children among those killed and said flames were

   It was not known what set off the fire. The dry mistral wind
blowing over Sardinia fanned the flames and impeded firefighting

<TEXT>
   A runaway train that careened off
its tracks into a row of houses, killing four people, was going
faster and had less braking capacity and more weight than indicated
in preliminary reports, federal officials said Monday.
   The derailment and a deadly explosion of an underground pipeline
that occurred 13 days later in the crash area are the subject of a
five-day National Transportation Safety Board inquiry. The hearing
began Monday.
   In addition to focusing on the train's mechanics, the hearing is
addressing the crew's response to the emergency. Local efforts to
determine the pipeline's safety after the derailment also were
examined.
   The Southern Pacific freight train, with 69 cars and six
locomotives, was traveling between 105 mph and 110 mph when it
derailed May 12, William Pugh, the NTSB investigator in charge, told
the hearing.
   Initial estimates of a train speed of 90 mph as it swooped down
from a mountain pass were discarded after a computer analysis of the
accident, said board chairman Lee Dickenson.
   The train crested the summit of Cajon Pass at 30 mph with
engineer Frank Holland believing the loaded train weighed 6,151 tons
and had full braking capability on at least four locomotives,
according to testimony by Holland and Pugh.
   But the accident investigation has found the weight of the train
was about 8,900 tons, and that possibly only two of the locomotive
had ``dynamic braking'' capability _ which Dickenson described as
akin to downshifting on a car to help slow it.
   The train could have been halted if it was at the weight Holland
used in his calculations, Dickenson said during a hearing break.
   Pugh said the weight for the cars, which were loaded with a
mineral called trona, had not been provided by the shipper, Lakes
Minerals Corp. In order to satisfy a computer requirement for
preparation of the weigh bills, the weight was estimated, he said.
   A routine test had indicated braking problems with one locomotive
and intermittent problems with another, Holland said. Two helper
locomotives were added to the train at Oban, before the Cajon Pass,
at Holland's request.
   But the engineer said he was not informed that one of the helper
units also lacked dynamic braking capability.
   The board also heard from witnesses to the May 25 gas explosion
that killed two people and injured 30 in a San Bernardino
neighborhood. A total of 17 homes were destroyed in the derailment
and explosion.
   James Knight, deputy chief of the San Bernardino Fire Department,
told the NTSB panel that he spoke with a representative of the
Calnev Pipe Line Co. after the train wreck, and recommended that the
entire line be unearthed and examined for possible damage. He also
recommended that the gas inside be removed, if possible, and
replaced with water.
   The line supplies 90 percent of Las Vegas' gas and nearly all the
jet fuel to George and Edwards air force bases.
   ``They said they planned to uncover the pipeline,'' Knight said.
   ``Did they?'' he was asked.
   ``No.''
   Knight, who said that Calnev had uncovered and examined only
three areas of the pipeline, added that he did not have the
jurisdiction to influence the company's actions.

<HEAD>British Newspaper, Leading Jews Attack Cardinal Glemp on Auschwitz
Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   American Jewish leaders and a mass circulation British newspaper
assailed Cardinal Jozef Glemp of Poland on Monday for his weekend
remarks on the furor over a convent at Auschwitz death camp, calling
his comments anti-Semitic.
   The Daily Mirror paper said in an editorial that the Roman
Catholic prelate's stand must have had the backing of Pope John Paul
II.
   ``The cardinal has tapped into the deep vein of anti-Semitism
which has existed in his country for a thousand years. He would not
have done so without the knowledge of the pope, himself a Pole,'' it
said.
   Kalman Sultanik, vice president of the World Jewish Congress,
said in New York on Monday, ``Cardinal Glemp's grotesque and
hate-filled remarks have been strongly condemned by Solidarity and
revealed that an ugly vein of anti-Semitism runs through the Polish
church.''
   Glemp suggested in an address on Saturday to pilgrims at Jasna
Gora Monastery in Czestochowa, Poland, that Jews were being
anti-Polish in objecting to the existence of a Carmelite convent at
Auschwitz, site of a Nazi German death camp set up in Poland mainly
to exterminate Jews.
   He asked Jews worldwide to halt their objections, saying, ``If
there would be no `anti-Polonism,' there will be no anti-Semitism in
our country.''
   Glemp was responding to international criticism of the abrogation
by the church on Aug. 10 of a 1987 pledge to move the convent from
the camp perimeter. Many Jewish groups consider the convent an
intrusion at the site.
   A. James Rudin, chairman of interreligious affairs of the
American Jewish Committee, said in New York on Monday, ``We're in a
spiritual gridlock and the kind of rhetoric of Cardinal Glemp
doesn't help. He seems to be reviving some of the anti-Jewish
canards of the past.''
   Rudin said Glemp's comment ``raises the anger of many people and
feeds into the anti-Jewish stereotypes of some Polish people that we
thought we had overcome. I hope that won't be the final word from
Cardinal Glemp.''
   Rabbi Avi Weiss of the Riverdale section of New York City, one of
seven Jews who demonstrated on July 14 at the convent at Auschwitz,
said Glemp was quoted as saying, ``A squad of seven New York Jews
launched an attack against the convent, but did not kill the nuns or
destroy the convent only because they were stopped.''
   Weiss said Monday in New York, ``Glemp's statement is as close to
a blood libel as one can come. We're calling upon the Vatican to
discipline Cardinal Glemp.''
   The seven demonstrators were roughly dragged away by workmen at
the camp.
   Weiss said that Jacek Kuron, a leader of the Solidarity union in
Poland, told him, ``I feel very much ashamed as a Pole for what
happened to you.''
   The Daily Mirror said in its editorial: ``The butchers were
German Nazis and their renegade allies, but when Cardinal Glemp
spoke warmly of the improving relations with Poland's old enemies,
Germany and Russia, he used dangerously inflammatory language
against the Jews.
   ``He tried to justify his own shameless bad faith in tearing up a
solemn agreement that a Carmelite convent would be removed from
Auschwitz, a place which the Holocaust made holy to Jews.
   ``The Polish Catholic Church had given its word that the nuns
would be moved by last February. Cardinal Glemp broke it without a
qualm. And now that the Jews insist that he keeps the promise, he
accuses them of violating Poland's sovereignty.
   ``In the name of God, what does he hope to gain by fanning the
embers of hate?''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Former Mexican Officials May Be Implicated in Drug
Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor said in court Monday that former
officials of the Mexican government may be implicated in connection
with the torture murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   The comments by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jimmy Gurule came during
a federal hearing at which he won the continued imprisonment of a
material witness who is the brother-in-law of former Mexican
President Luis Echeverria.
   The prosecutor told U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie that the
``political clout'' of Ruben Zuno Arce makes him a key witness in
the ongoing probe of Camarena's 1985 murder.
   Gurule said the government now believes that corrupt political
officials and law enforcement officers ``at higher levels'' were
present at a Guadalajara home during a brutal interrogation of
Camarena in the hours before he was murdered.
   Gurule's courtroom comments were made to support continued
imprisonment of Zuno, who has been held since Aug. 9 as a material
witness without any charges filed against him.
   Zuno testified before a grand jury last Thursday, but Gurule said
he did not conclude the questioning and wants him to return next
Thursday.
   Rafeedie asked for a general indication of the testimony in order
to decide whether to keep the witness in prison.
   ``There were denials regarding his association with narcotics
traffickers,'' said Gurule. ``But there were admissions of his
association with political officials at the highest level
...including (President) Lopez Portillo. ... He could place calls
and the president of Mexico would answer immediately. He had that
type of political clout.''
   Gurule said he believes that Zuno acted as ``a go-between'' for
politicians and drug traffickers including Rafael Caro Quintero.
Caro has been accused of ordering Camarena's execution and is
awaiting trial in Mexico.
   Camarena allegedly was tortured and murdered at a home that Caro
bought indirectly from Zuno. Gurule said the government wants
information about transfer of the property.
   The kidnapping and torture murder of Camarena and his pilot,
Alfredo Zavala-Avelar, became an international incident. The Drug
Enforcement Administration has vowed to bring in every person
involved in the murders. Several members of the Mexican federal
police force were linked to the killings and one, Raul Lopez
Alvarez, was convicted last year along with two drug traffickers.
   Camarena and Zavala were killed after the narcotics agent led a
series of damaging raids on marijuana plantations allegedly operated
by Caro, authorities have said.
   Camarena's body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles
southeast of Guadalajara.
   Seven more men are charged with murder and conspiracy in the
case, including Caro. This month, a grand jury indicted yet another
defendant, former Mexican police officer Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez.
His trial is set for Oct. 3 and the government wants Zuno to testify
against him.
   Zuno's lawyers argued futilely for his immediate release, saying
he has been ``roughed up'' while in custody and is being denied
visits with his wife who is Echeverria's sister.
   ``I don't think they could do this with an American citizen,''
said attorney Edward Medvene. ``Just because he's Mexican it's not
fair.''
   Rafeedie, who ordered prison officials to allow visits by Zuno's
wife, ordered Zuno's continued imprisonment while he concludes his
testimony before the grand jury. After that, the judge said, he
wants lawyers to file briefs on why the witness cannot be released.
   The judge scheduled a hearing for Sept. 5 to consider Zuno's
future status.
   Outside court, Gurule declined to comment on when further
indictments might be expected in the Camarena case, saying only,
``We are hopeful there will be more to come.''

<HEAD>Settlements Reached in Phone Strikes in Illinois, Pennsylvania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bell Atlantic reached tentative pacts Monday with striking unions
in Pennsylvania, foreshadowing the end of a 23-day walkout by phone
workers in six states and Washington, D.C.
   Illinois Bell, meanwhile, agreed to a contract with its strikers.
But union officials urged Illinois members to stay out until
agreements are reached with Bell companies in Michigan and Indiana.
   Another strike continued in New York City, where hundreds of
union members held a rally at Flushing Meadows Park, site of the
U.S. Open Tennis championship. NYNEX Corp., serving New York and
most of New England, is a corporate sponsor of the tournament, which
began Monday.
   Nationally, 200,000 workers in 20 states went on strike earlier
this month against four of the so-called ``Baby Bell'' regional
telephone companies formed after the 1984 breakup of AT&amp;T.
   Bell Atlantic's strike began Aug. 6. A tentative contract
settlement was reached 11 days later with the company, which covers
West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania,
Washington, D.C., and New Jersey.
   However, local issues remained in dispute, and CWA officials had
urged the 41,000 strikers to remain out until they were resolved in
all seven states.
   Agreements were reached Monday with the last unions: two CWA
locals representing 8,900 technicians and 2,700 service
representatives in Pennsylvania and two Delaware locals, said
spokesmen for Bell Atlantic subsidiaries Bell of Pennsylvania and
Diamond State Telephone.
   In a statement from Washington, CWA Vice President Peter Catucci
told strikers to report to work at the start of their next shift.
   However, Denny Martin, president of a Pennsylvania local, said
later that a hitch had developed over one or two issues in the
Delaware pact, and said no one would report to work until it was
resolved. A resolution was expected shortly.
   Negotiations were continuing, according to Bell of Pennsylvania
spokesman Mike Kaine.
   Neither side released terms of the agreements. The issues
discussed included grievance procedures, work rules, and contracting
for outside work, officials said.
   ``We are pleased to have reached an end to this long dispute with
the Bell Atlantic companies,'' Catucci said earlier.
   Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman Tom Duddy said the strike
inconvenienced few customers, but said it would take a few days to
return to normal operations.
   ``Twenty-three days is a long time for a strike,'' he said.
``We're proud of the way both sides of the picket line have handled
themselves.''
   A tentative contract settlement has also been reached at Pacific
Telesis, which serves California and Nevada.
   Weekend settlements in Ohio and Wisconsin paved the way for the
Illinois contract agreement, said CWA spokesman Steve Rosenthal.
Bell companies in those three states, as well as Indiana and
Michigan, are subsidiaries of Ameritech.
   Although union officials urged strikers to stay out pending
settlements in Michigan and Indiana, Illinois Bell expressed hope
that workers would be back on the job soon. The company said
managers would continue filling in.
   Details of the three-year pact were withheld until they could be
given to the 2,900 strikers, most of them operators, who walked out
Aug. 13. No date for a ratification vote was announced.
   Both sides described the agreement as fair. `It contains
provisions that will increase basic wages, improve pension and
health care benefits and address child and family care needs,'' the
company and union said in a joint statement.
   Negotiators on both sides would not say whether a compromise had
been reached on the main issue: how a 5 percent pay raises would be
granted.
   The union had objected to a company proposal to give part of the
raise as a one-time $1,000 payment to each employee in the first
year of the pact. The union wanted the full 5 percent, which would
give workers a higher base from which to calculate raises and
overtime pay.
   Under the current contract, CWA employees start at $222 a week
and can rise to a maximum of $446 after five years.
   At the New York rally, union members heard speeches by CWA
President Morton Bahr and other union leaders, then marched around
the section of the park where the U.S. Open was being played.
   The union was not trying to disrupt the games or keep people from
attending, said union spokesman Bob Masters.
   Talks involving NYNEX, the CWA and the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers are to resume Wednesday.

   Colombia's justice minister and Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh on Monday discussed extradition of Colombian
drug traffickers wanted here and tighter security for judges in that
embattled nation.
   Monica de Greiff, accompanied by top Colombian law enforcement
and military officials, discussed the implementation of U.S. aid to
stem the wave of assassinations of Colombian judges by the drug
lords, the Justice Department said in a statement issued after an
hour-long meeting.
   Besides the extradition of some 80 Colombian drug traffickers
wanted by U.S. authorities, Ms. de Greiff and Thornburgh also
discussed training and equipping Colombian police and armed forces
for the war against the Medellin cocaine cartel, the department said.
   The discussions, which for a time included John C. Lawn, head of
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, also touched on getting
help for the Colombian judiciary from other nations, the department
said.
   The meeting came just hours after Colombian President Virgilio
Barco, in Bogota, put to rest rumors that his 32-year-old justice
minister had decided to resign in the face of death threats from
drug cartel leaders worried about possible extradition to the United
States.
   In Bogota, the U.S. ambassador, Thomas McNamara, met with Foreign
Minister Julio Londono Paredes. No details of their 20-minute
meeting were available.
   Ms. de Greiff arrived at the Justice Department and later left
under heavy security provided by the Drug Enforcement Administration
and the FBI.
   As reports circulated about a death threat against Ms. de
Greiff's 3-year old son, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
acknowledged that continued violence against enemies of cartel
chieftains was a ``serious danger.''
   Ms. De Greiff was being housed in a location that was being kept
secret for security reasons.
   Thornburgh has said he expects that Colombian authorities will
deliver to U.S. officials this week Eduardo Martinez Romero, who was
arrested recently as part of a government crackdown against the
cartel. Martinez has been under U.S. indictment since March.
   Ms. De Greiff's apparent decision to remain on the job rather
than resign in the face of death threats spared Barco an additional
setback in his efforts to gain the upper hand in the struggle
against the cocaine traffickers. De Greiff, who was appointed only
six weeks ago, is the eighth Colombian justice minister in three
years.
   ``As I understand it, our contacts through the (U.S.) embassy
indicate that President Barco has denied that she has resigned,''
said White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk, speaking to reporters at
President Bush's vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The drug traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every
trafficker sent to the United States to face trial.
   As part of the U.S. effort to assist Colombia in its crackdown,
the White House announced last Friday a $65 million military aid
program. In addition, the Justice Department is providing $2 million
to help protect Colombian judges.
   In another development, Bush declined to discuss reports he's
considering the use of covert military actions to help Colombia.
   Teeing off for a golf game, Bush was asked about a Newsweek
report which said that he was weighing such support for Barco's
crackdown
   ``If I discussed covert action it wouldn't be covert. I don't
discuss that kind of thing at all,'' he replied. Bush cautioned,
however, that his reply should not be interpreted as a ``yes or a no
or a confirm or a deny.''
   Bush was briefed on the Colombia situation by national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   An administration official, speaking on grounds of anonymity,
said Bush would like to use U.S. military teams and special forces
to help Barco. But the president's hands are tied by Barco's own
statements that he does not want such assistance, the source said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel, meanwhile, said
federal prosecutors were concerned that some of their cases against
80 Colombian drug dealers charged with violating U.S. laws have
``gone stale'' while the suspects remained at large in Latin America.
   ``Witnesses could disappear'' or other ``evidentiary problems''
could have arisen with the passage of time since the suspects were
charged by U.S. authorities, Runkel said.
   ``It's not as easy a matter as saying `we brought the indictment,
the person is here,''' Runkel said. ``There is some concern that
some of these cases may have gone stale.''
   Justice Department prosecutors are reviewing the cases against
the 80 defendants to determine which ones can still be proven in
court if the suspects are caught and brought to the United States
for trial. ``When we have a strong case and we can get our hands on
that person we will bring a case,'' Runkel said.
   On Tuesday, Bush is to huddle with Thornburgh, drug policy
director William J. Bennett and other top administration officials
at the president's compound in Maine to discuss the drug strategy he
will unveil Sept. 5.
   The Justice Department said that Thornburgh will report to Bush
about his meeting with Ms. de Greiff.
   Also in attendance at the Justice Department meeting were
Colombian Ambassador Victor Mosquera, Gen. Camilo Zuniga, chief of
the armed forces intelligence, Gen. Armondo Casadiego, sub-director
of the Colombian national police and Alberto Romero, chief of
intelligence for the Colombian equivalent of the FBI.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Government Request in Poindexter Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday granted a government
request to narrow a conspiracy charge in the Iran-Contra indictment
against former National Security Adviser John Poindexter.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene agreed to drop
allegations of a conspiracy by Poindexter and others to illegally
divert funds to the Contras from the Reagan administration's secret
arms sales to Iran.
   Remaining in the indictment are allegations that Poindexter
conspired to obstruct Congress, make false statements and destroy
official documents in the Iran-Contra scandal. His alleged
co-conspirators were former White House aide Oliver North and
businessmen Richard Secord and Albert Hakim. North enlisted Secord's
help in running arms to the Contras during a congressional ban in
military aid to the Nicaraguan rebel force.
   Poindexter also is accused of two counts of obstruction of
Congress and two counts of making false statements to Congress.
Those counts relate to denials that North was assisting the Contras
and denials that Poindexter knew that Hawk missiles were aboard a
November 1985 shipment to Iran.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, whose office is prosecuting
Poindexter, had sought to abandon portions of the conspiracy charge
to avoid problems relating to the disclosure of classified
information.
   U.S. intelligence agencies in the North trial were concerned that
too much material relating to sensitive national security matters
would come out in court in a trial of the conspiracy charge relating
to the diversion of funds.
   The Justice Department has the power to file an affidavit
prohibiting disclosure of such sensitive information, an action
which could lead to dismissal of some or all of the criminal charges
in a case.

   Israel spoke on Monday of a growing wave of
anti-Semitic attacks abroad and urged foreign governments to fight
the trend as ``a shameful and disgusting phenomenon.''
   Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein told foreign reporters at a
news conference the government was closely monitoring the attacks
and deeply concerned about them.
   Israel was founded as a Jewish homeland after the Nazi Holocaust
killed 6 million Jews.
   An official from the World Zionist Organization's Information
Department, Yochanan Manor, gave figues showing assaults motivated
by anti-Semitism on Jews rose worldwide from fewer than 200 annually
in the 1960s to more than 2,000 a year at the close of the 1980s.
   More than half the current attacks occur in the United States,
Manor said.
   In the last two years, arson attacks against Jewish targets and
attacks on synagogues in the United States and Europe doubled, he
said.
   Manor said most incidents involved anti-Jewish slogans or
swastikas painted on walls and arson attacks on synagogues.
   Rubinstein said he believed anti-Semitic attacks were increasing
because people were less aware of the repercussions of anti-Semitism
more than 40 years after the Holocaust.
   ``Anti-Semitism must be treated as a shameful and disgusting
phenomenon that has no place among civilized people and enlightened
countries,'' Rubinstein said.
   He noted the possible influence of the 20-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories, which has
marred Israel's image.
   ``The intefadeh,'' Rubinstein said, using the Arabic word for
uprising, ``may have been used as an excuse for serving as a basis
of anti-Israeli phenomena.''

<TEXT>
   The army said Monday that it arrested a
financial wizard of the drug trade who is wanted in the United
States. He was seized at a ranch near Medellin along with 4.5 metric
tons of cocaine, it said.
   In an international appeal broadcast Monday, President Virgilio
Barco said survival of this South American nation of 30 million
people is at stake in the drug war.
   He said the war does not stop at Colombia's borders, and that
cocaine-users everywhere ``have created the largest, most vicious
criminal enterprise the world has ever known.''
   Also Monday, the U.S. ambassador in Bogota, Thomas McNamara, met
with the foreign minister, Julio Londono Paredes. No details of
their 20-minute meeting were immediately available.
   A Defense Ministry communique said the army kept up its pressure
on traffickers Monday, seizing 8.2 metric tons of marijuana in two
raids in the Caribbean coastal city of Barranquilla.
   The army's 11th Brigade in Medellin said in a communique that
Abraham Majuat _ identified as a top financial man for drug dealers
_ was detained last week. It said soldiers also found 4.5 metric
tons of cocaine, or about 9,120 pounds at the ranch.
   The communique said Majuat was wanted in the United States on
drug-related charges but gave no further details. The U.S. Embassy
in Colombia would not confirm or deny the army report.
   Medellin is hometown for the world's biggest drug organization
that reportedly is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine sent by
air, sea and land to the United States.
   In Washington, Monica de Greiff, Colombia's justice minister who
has led a crackdown on cocaine barons, met with U.S. officials.
Barco's office denied reports she had resigned in fear of being
killed.
   Nationwide raids and dragnets began after the assassination on
Aug. 18 of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of the drug
trade and Colombia's leading presidential candidate.
   Police and soldiers have arrested more than 11,000 people and
seized hundreds of millions of dollars in property.
   The radio network Caracol reported on Monday officials impounded
17 branches of a drug store chain in Cordoba state allegedly
belonging to a top drug trafficker.
   Colombia has said drug traffickers wanted in the United States
would be extradited.
   Among those detained was Eduardo Martinez Romero, a reputed
finance manager for the Medellin cartel. He is wanted in the United
States in connection with a $1.2 billion money-laundering operation.
   Monday's meeting between U.S. envoy McNamara and Paredes was
thought to center on Martinez's extradition.
   Washington has pledged $65 million worth of helicopters and other
help.
   The drug traffickers have declared war on the government. They
have burned houses and set off bombs because of the crackdown, but
no new acts of terrorism were reported Monday.
   About 100 national policemen are being sent to Medellin, where
cocaine dealers bombed nine banks Sunday, that city's mayor said.
   Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez said in a statement Monday that 4,000
national police already were stationed in his northwestern city of 2
million, and ``we are going through a really difficult situation.''
   In his broadcast, Barco called Galan ``the latest of thousands of
Colombian martyrs who have given their lives in the fight against
drugs.''
   ``We may have borne the brunt of the violence, but it does not
stop at our borders.
   ``Those of you who depend on cocaine have created the largest,
most vicious criminal enterprise the world has ever known. What
might seem to be a matter of personal habit ... has thrown us all
into a war we did not ask for. Colombia's survival as the oldest
democracy in Latin America is now at risk, but so is the safety of
your streets.''
   Mrs. de Greiff was in Washington Monday in an official capacity
and conferring with U.S. officials.
   She met with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh about the anti-drug
war, arriving in an unmarked official car that drove into the
Justice Department's underground parking garage.
   The news agency Colprensa said Mrs de Greiff flew to Washington
on Thursday after a plan was uncovered to kill her.
   Bogota newspapers have published stories for days saying Mrs. de
Greiff, 32, would resign because of threats against her, her husband
and their 3-year-old child. She has been in the job less than two
months.
   A spokesman for Barco, Gabriel Gutierrez, told The Associated
Press that as of Monday afternoon Mrs. de Greiff had not resigned.
   Rumors of her resignation circulated after she said in a TV
interview last week: ``I wasn't prepared to work in times of war,
such as now.''
   Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, a predecessor of Mrs. de Greiff, was killed
by drug cartel assassins in 1984.
   Last week, the traffickers said they would kill 10 jurists for
every one of their number extradited.

fire, which followed a confrontation between a group of Mohawks
opposed to the gambling parlors and a self-appointed reservation
security force.
   The confrontation also triggered a brief standoff between state
police and the security force, called the Warriors Society, on the
reservation straddling the U.S.-Canadian border in northern New York.
   Reservation residents said a group of gambling opponents came
together as a vigilante mob that burned the casino, which was
scheduled to open Tuesday and featured slot machines, craps tables
and other games.
   ``It was torched right there,'' said Alex Jacobs, a reporter and
program director for CKON-Radio, a public radio station.
   Franklin County fire investigators said Monday that arson is
suspected, but the blaze remains under investigation.
   Casino owner Victoria Adams said she had just left the building
when the mob stormed it and set the fire with Molotov cocktails. She
said the mob tried to burn other casinos on the reservation but were
fended off by armed guards.
   State police said the conflict involved ``upwards of 500''
people. The incident lasted about six hours.
   While state troopers set up roadblocks to reroute traffic around
the reservation, Warriors Society members, expecting state police to
intervene, set up their own armed checkpoints just inside the
reservation.
   After several tense hours, both sides relinquished their
respective strongholds along the perimeter of the reservation, which
was the site of a 10-day standoff between troopers and the warriors
after a gambling raid July 20 by state and federal authorities.
   Gambling is illegal in New York, and state officials have
contested the tribe's right to operate casinos. The Mohawks contend
they are not bound by state or federal gambling laws since they
consider their reservation a sovereign nation.
   Pro-gambling Mohawks voted this month to permit gambling on the
reservation, but anti-gambling Indians claim the vote was invalid.
   State police and tribal leaders reached an agreement this month
to resume patrols on the reservation, but the Warriors Society has
said they would allow troopers on their land only with advance
notice and escorts.

   Jim Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial
opened Monday with a federal prosecutor accusing the TV evangelist
of fleecing followers he considered ``tacky'' so that he could live
in high style.
   A former aide testified that the founder of the PTL television
ministry said he ``wanted to be paid like Johnny Carson'' and told
him how top ministry executives took a cut from the money they
raised.
   But Bakker's lawyer said in his opening argument that the founder
of the PTL television ministry was ``a creative, religious genius''
who is unfairly accused.
   Prosecutors say Bakker and other executives at the evangelical
empire diverted for their own benefit at least $4 million of the
$158 million they raised by selling ``lifetime partnerships'' at the
ministry's resort hotels.
   If convicted of all 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakker
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million.
   ``Have a nice day'' was all the 49-year-old evangelist said as he
entered the courthouse.
   Meanwhile, Bakker's wife, Tammy, carried on with their new
broadcast from Orlando, Fla., asking viewers to pray for Bakker. She
said she wanted to have the ``Jim and Tammy Show'' on the air so
``Jim will have something to come home to.''
   Bakker quit PTL amid revelations about his 1980 sexual encounter
with church secretary Jessica Hahn and a $265,000 payoff to her.
   Outside the courthouse Monday, the opening of the trial was
marked by reporters and spectators vying for seats in the small
court, and two men carrying signs denouncing Bakker and several
other broadcast evangelists.
   ``We just want people to know God isn't playing games. Anybody
who reads the Bible knew that (PTL) wasn't right,'' said Bob
Eckhardt of Columbia, S.C.
   A young woman and a man sold hip-hugging ``Bible Belts,'' belts
adorned with small Bibles.
   A jury was chosen last week. The first witness, David Taggart, a
former personal assistant to Bakker, testified that Bakker was
involved daily in details of the ministry's fund-raising, ``whether
he was on vacation or not.''
   Taggart and his brother James, PTL's interior decorator, were
convicted last month of tax evasion. Each faces 25 years in prison
and $1 million in fines at sentencing Sept. 8.
   Taggart, the only witness Monday, said he testified because ``it
might have some impact on my sentencing.''
   Taggart said Bakker also told him top PTL executives diverted
funds for their own use. ``He said some fund-raisers got up to 10
percent of what they took in,'' Taggart said.
   Under Bakker's orders, Taggart spent more than $500,000 in PTL
money to purchase and decorate a condominium for the Bakker family
in Highland Beach, Fla., in 1982. Taggart testified that PTL
directors did not approve the expenditure until several months later.
   Bakker complained about salary, Taggart testified. ``I remember
Mr. Bakker saying he wanted to be paid like Johnny Carson,'' he said.
   Taggart said that during Bakker's last 15 months at PTL, January
1986 to March 1987, the minister received nearly $1 million in
bonuses from the PTL board, including a $500,000 Christmas bonus in
November 1986 and a $100,000 Christmas gift that December.
   He told the jury about gold-plated faucets in Bakker's
four-bedroom, six-bath suite at a hotel at Heritage USA, PTL's
Christian theme park in Fort Mill, S.C., and about gold faucets in
Bakker's office suite bathrooms and his home.
   Taggart also testified that Bakker personally approved using PTL
money to pay Hahn to keep quiet about their sexual encounter.
   Deborah Smith, a Justice Department special prosecutor, asked
Taggart if Bakker ever discussed the holders of PTL partnerships.
   ``I recall Mr. Bakker looking out the window over the water park
and Heritage Grand Hotel and complaining that the partners were
dumb,'' he said. ``He said they would block the buses that were
coming into the lobby and they would wear their wet bathing suits in
the lobby of the hotel.''
   Taggart was to take the stand again Tuesday.
   The prosecution says PTL raised $158 million from 1984 to 1987 by
promising $1,000 donors three nights' lodging per year for life in
hotels at Heritage USA. During those years, Bakker and his wife drew
$3.5 million in bonuses plus other perks, prosecutors said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said the ``case is about
cheating people out of their money, tricking people out of their
money by the use of the mails, telephone and television.''
   Miller told jurors the money paid for ``a lavish lifestyle most
of you won't be able to identify with,'' including $100,000 for a
private jet to take the Bakkers' clothing to California. Miller said
the Bakkers had two Rolls Royces and four Mercedes cars, including
one used only to drive Bakker's 12-year-old son from place to place.
   Miller said that on one occasion, the Bakkers, delighted by the
smell of cinnamon buns from a bakery during a trip, sent a security
guard to the store to buy $100 worth of the rolls so they could
smell them in their hotel suite.
   ``Three days later, with not a bite taken out of any of them, the
security guard tossed them out,'' Miller said.
   ``You will hear evidence of Mr. Bakker's disdain for the people
he was asking to send money,'' Miller said. ``You will hear how he
described them as tacky because of the way they dressed.''
   Defense attorney George T. Davis said Bakker didn't ``sell''
anything. ``What happened was gifts or donations. This was a
church,'' Davis told the jury.
   Davis blamed problems at PTL on trusted lieutenants and noted
that former PTL vice president Richard Dortch and the Taggart
brothers are convicted felons.
   Dortch pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in exchange
for testimony against Bakker. He was sentenced last week to eight
years in prison and fined $200,000.

   The number of foreigners visiting China dropped
almost 50 percent in July, and tourism nearly dried up in the month
after the military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement,
according to the state tourism agency.
   The official China Daily on Tuesday quoted a State Tourism
Administration report as saying 80,000 foreign nationals visited
China in July, down 47.5 percent from the same month in 1988.
   Businessmen are included in the July visitor figure, which was up
11.3 percent from June.
   The report said China also received 4,700 overseas Chinese, down
30.2 percent from the previous year, and 1.69 million compatriots
from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, down 31.7 percent.
   China International Travel Service handled only 1,200 foreign
tourists, down 93.7 percent, China Travel Service received 41,100
tourists, down 58.2 percent and China Youth Travel Service received
only 900 people, down 91.9 percent.
   The report said tourism in Beijing, Shanghai and such tourist
spots as Hangzhou and Guilin was about 90 percent lower. There were
67.1 percent fewer tourists in Guangdong province, where Canton is
located.
   Most tourists have avoided China since martial law was imposed on
Beijing after the June 3-4 military attack on student-led
demonstrators in which hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people
were killed.
   Luxury hotels are operating at less than 50 percent of capacity,
restaurants catering to Western tourists are empty, famous tourist
sites such as the Great Wall are deserted. Many of the hawkers who
sold souvenirs to foreign visitors have gone out of business.

   A communist rebel has admitted taking
part in the April 21 shooting of U.S. Army Col. James Rowe, the
highest-ranking U.S. official to be killed in the 20-year-old
insurgency, the military said Monday.
   It announced that Juanito Itaas, 25, was arrested with a
companion Sunday evening in Davao City after intelligence reports
linked him to the death.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montanao, acting military chief of staff, said he
considered the Rowe case solved.
   It was the first time the military claimed to have arrested one
of the assassins. Police in June arrested a messenger for a
university newspaper in connection with the slaying but said later
he was not believed to have been among the actual assailants.
   Rowe, 51, of McAllen, Texas, a decorated Vietnam War veteran who
escaped after five years in a Viet Cong prison camp, was shot on his
way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in Quezon
City. Communist rebels claimed responsibility.
   Itaas was flown on Monday to Manila from Davao City, 610 miles
south of the capital. Officials said he would be charged with murder.
   Itaas told reporters in Davao City he was part of a seven-man
rebel team that ambushed Rowe a few blocks from his office.
   He said he was summonded to Manila from Davao City a week before
the killing to attend a communist meeting on organizational
problems. After arriving, Itaas said he was ordered to take part in
an assassination but did not know the intended target.
   Itaas also said he did not know the real names of any of the
others involved in the killing. He said he was among four assailants
in one of two cars. Three other assailants were in a backup vehicle,
he added.
   Military officials said Itaas admitted taking part in three other
assassinations of police and military officers in Davao City area.
His companion, Angelito Moralla, 23, was held as a suspected member
of the rebel logistics command.
   Rowe was assigned to a unit that provides training and logistical
support to the Philippine armed forces. Rebels claim the
organization also assists the military clandestinely in
counterinsurgency operations.

   Opposition parties said Monday the new
government that takes over Sept. 1 will continue ``the military
dictatorship,'' but promised they will not take to the streets to
fight the new regime.
   In an official communique, the opposition coalition led by the
Christian Democratic Party called on people to remain ``alert and
watchful and determined to impose through peaceful means its
vocation of democracy, justice and freedom.''
   It did not call on Panamanians to protest in the streets, as it
has in the past.
   Also Monday, pro-government parties met to discuss the formula
for a government that takes over Sept. 1 when the current
government's term expires without an elected replacement.
   Two possibilities were being discussed: forming a
civilian-military junta or appointing an acting president with
authority to call elections in the near future.
   The government annulled May 7 presidential elections, arguing
U.S. intervention in favor of the opposition distorted the results.
International observers backed opposition claims they won a
landslide victory.
   Washington accuses Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, commander of the
Panamanian defense forces, of canceling the elections in another
move to fight U.S. attempts to have him removed from power.
   Noriega has been indicted in the United States on
drug-trafficking charges. He denies the charges as another U.S.
government plot to discredit him.
   Oppositon parties refused a government offer to participate in a
civilian-military junta on Sept. 1.
   ``On Sept. 2, the government will find that it has not solved the
economic crisis and its international isolation is worse than it
was,'' Christian Democratic leader and former vice presidential
candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon told The Associated Press.
   He said the new government will be ``another version of the
military dictatorship.''
   The government and opposition failed to agree on a new government
because the opposition insists that Noriega retire. The government
will not consider dimissing the general who wields the real power in
Panama.
   The Organization of American States tried unsuccessfully to
mediate the dispute.

   A student charged with spreading rumors to the
Voice of America during the pro-democracy protests has been given a
nine-year prison term, a state newspaper reported today. It was the
first announced sentencing of a student participant since the
government's June crackdown.
   The China Youth News said Zhang Weiping was sentenced by the
Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court for spreading
counter-revolutionary propaganda and instigating criminal acts.
   Zhang, a fourth-year student at Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in
the eastern city of Hangzhou, admitted some of the charges against
him but would not acknowledge that his acts were
counter-revolutionary, the daily said.
   The court said that on June 6, two days after the bloody military
crackdown of the student movement in Beijing, Zhang called the
U.S.-government-funded Voice of America and falsely reported that
students in Hangzhou had forced local authorities to fly the Chinese
flag at half-staff to mourn victims of the Beijing massacre.

   Fifty years after World War II erupted, half of
all Americans believe global war will consume the world again one
day, a Media General-Associated Press poll has found.
   A majority of those who expect another world war believe it will
happen within two decades, the survey found. And if it does recur,
most Americans fear it will escalate into an all-out nuclear
conflagration.
   A majority of respondents to the poll also said one of World War
II's darkest episodes could recur: A holocaust on the order of Nazi
Germany's murder of more than 6 million Jews.
   The 1,163 respondents were asked: ``Do you think that kind of

people because of their religion or ethnic background?'' Six in 10

   The Kremlin cannot trust the Polish Army in

Western war planners bank on Polish troops breaking ranks with their

   ``It is an unreliable force. I think that has been the Soviet
General Staff calculation for years, and I think it has got to be
even more the conclusion'' now that the communists have lost control
of the Polish government, said A. Ross Johnson, a former RAND Corp.

   Unless the Soviets have firm control of Polish rail lines, they
would face grave difficulties waging a ground war in Europe,
according to analysts who have studied the issue for the Pentagon.
   Ian Cutherbertson, a British expert on Eastern Europe, said,
``The Soviets long have realized the unreliability of the Polish

<HEAD>Freddy's Last Stand?</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Englund recalls some advice Mel Brooks
dispensed when Mark Hammill fretted about being typed forever as
Luke Skywalker as a result of the ``Star Wars'' movies. The gospel
according to Brooks: ``Never get off the merry-go-round while it's
still turning.''
   Says Englund: ``I remember Mark, drinking a beer and watching an
old `Mary Tyler Moore Show' with me up in Laurel Canyon. He was so
worried until Mel Brooks gave him that advice at 20th Century Fox.
It really made sense to me, watching Mark and seeing his angst. I
said to Mark, `What's your problem? You're starring in `Star Wars!'
   ``I've used that advice all through the Freddy craze, and it's
really kept me focused. The merry-go-round's going to stop pretty
soon. I'll get off nice and gently and go on to other things.''
   The ``Freddy craze'' is having another go-round this summer with
``Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.'' It's yet another
encounter with Freddy Kreuger, that charmer with the prune face and
the steel-bladed fingers. However, the film has opened quite poorly,
falling a staggering 57 percent in its second week of release for a
take of only $3.5 million. It looks like this could be Freddy's last
stand.
   For an actor who has performed Shakespeare and Ibsen, Englund
retains a healthy attitude about the character who has dominated his
career for the past five years.
   ``I do Freddy once a year,'' explained Englund. ``People accuse
me of doing it for the money now. But I've had a decent career, and
I'm still doing a lot of other things. I'm even turning down jobs
because of conflicts in schedule.
   ``I enjoy doing Freddy. I don't enjoy putting the makeup on
anymore; it's a real (2{ hour) drag. Once it's on, it's wonderfully
designed, porous so it can breathe. I love being able to kid around
with the crew as Freddy on the set. I love that it's the one time in
my life on film that I can really be larger than life, I can
exaggerate. It's the kind of acting that's generally reserved for
the theater.''
   The ``Nightmare'' series is the kind of bonanza of which small
film companies such as New Line Cinema dream. The original film was
the creature of the poor man's Alfred Hitchcock, Wes Craven, who
created such throat-grabbing terror that the $1.2 million investment
returned $26 million in tickets sold. The cost has risen with each
sequel, but so has the gross: $30 million for No. 2, $45 million for
No. 3, $50 million for No. 4.
   Who attends the slice and dice teen-oriented movies?
   ``I think the original audience were punk rockers and heavy metal
kids,'' said Englund. ``They discovered the movie on their own;
there was no hype at the beginning because New Line didn't have any
money to advertise.
   ``There was a certain subversiveness, a certain anarchy to
Freddy, a slight attack on middle-class complacency. After all _
`Elm Street.' What does that stand for? Picket fences and mowed
lawns.
   ``With the budgets increasing, we changed to more of a fantasy
and a special effects film. The audience has grown with it. We've
gotten the `Poltergeist' audience. We've gotten the kid brother and
sister of the heavy metal and punk kids. And their parents, too.''
   Without the Freddy makeup, Englund is a pleasant, even bland
looking 40-year-old with a short beard and curly blond hair. He was
a California boy who attended Northridge State University and the
University of California at Los Angeles before studying at the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art in London.
   After playing the classics in the East, Englund decided to give
Hollywood a try, and he appeared in such films as ``Buster and
Billie'' (Jan-Michael Vincent), ``Stay Hungry'' (Jeff Bridges, Sally
Field) and ``Last of the Cowboys'' (Henry Fonda). Television brought
him recognition, especially the miniseries ``V.'' He was also
obliged to do the subsequent ``V'' series.
   ``I was playing the most beatific, nerdy little guy _ the good
alien,'' the actor said. ``I did the first `Elm Street' to meet Wes
Craven, whom I'd heard a lot about, and also for the challenge of
doing a character in makeup. I figured I was going to be locked into
the television for five years. I wanted to show the town that I
could do something very, very different.''
   As a slight change of pace, Englund will appear this autumn in
the title role of a production of ``Phantom of the Opera.''
   ``Not the musical; I have the worst monotone in the world,'' he
added hastily. ``This is from the original novel.''

<HEAD>Brazil's Catholic Progressives Vow Political Fight for Poor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<UNK>By KEN SILVERSTEIN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>DUQUE DE CAXIAS, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The progressive wing of Brazil's
Roman Catholic Church has promised to keep fighting for political
change on behalf of the nation's impoverished multitudes, despite
Pope John Paul II's warnings that politics is not the business of
priests.
   ``In Latin America, religion has too often been utilized to
justify submission and domination,'' said Bishop Pedro Casaldaliga,
a leader of the progressive wing, which is the dominant faction in
the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops. ``It's necessary now
to stimulate the connection between faith and politics and work for
greater social justice.''
   Casaldaliga, who is Spanish-born, has received death threats for
defending Indians and landless peasants in his diocese in the
western state of Mato Grosso. He also has praised Nicaragua's
Sandinista government and leftist groups in El Salvador and
Guatemala.
   Last year, he received a letter from the Vatican criticizing his
pastoral work and placing restrictions on his visits to Central
America.
   But he said he would not be silenced.
   ``I can't accept the separation of life and politics,''
Casaldaliga said in an interview. ``To renounce my political
commitments would be equivalent to renouncing my faith.''
   Political involvement was the key message at a meeting of 2,000
delegates representing 100,000 ``Ecclesiastical Base Communities,''
church-sponsored social groups set up mainly in poor urban and rural
areas of Brazil.
   Among the delegates gathering in this poor, crime-ridden Rio de
Janeiro suburb were 95 of Brazil's 374 bishops, 135 priests, 100
nuns and 900 church workers. The others were community
representatives.
   The five-day meeting in July offered workshops on topics such as
``The Formation of Christians for Political Participation'' and
``Political Militance and the Deepening of Faith.''
   Casaldaliga described the meeting as ``especially important''
because it was held despite Vatican pressure on the Brazilian church.
   While the progressives remain dominant in the National Conference
of Brazilian Bishops, the church's main operational organization
here, it has become more centrist over the past few years, largely
as a result of the appointment of a number of conservative bishops
by the Vatican.
   Brazilians use the term ``progressives'' to describe what in
other parts of the world are called liberals.
   Brazilian church leaders were the most prominent critics of the
military government that ruled from 1964 to 1985 and have frequently
clashed with the civilian government that followed. The bishops
conference has accused the current administration of President Jose
Sarney of corruption and failure to implement a promised agrarian
reform program.
   The Brazilian church also has had several well publicized
disputes with the Vatican in recent years.
   The Rev. Leonardo Boff, Brazil's most prominent progressive
theologian, was ordered to maintain ``obedient silence'' for a year
in 1985. Early this year, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns, another
progressive leader, had his Sao Paulo Archdiocese divided into five
smaller dioceses, seriously undermining his influence.
   But Carlos Alberto Libanio Christo, a Dominican friar who was
imprisoned for four years by Brazil's military government, said it
was essential for church leaders to continue to take stands on
social questions.
   ``Brazil finds itself in very difficult circumstances,'' he added
in an interview after the conference. ``For example, we have a
foreign debt of $112 billion, the highest in the developing world,
and will pay out $12 billion this year alone in interest on it.
Solutions to problems such as the debt are eminently political.
   ``The Vatican cannot be against politics. After all, the pope is
also a head of state.''
   Tomas Balduino, bishop of Goias, about 150 miles west of
Brasilia, the capital, in central Brazil, stressed the same theme.
   ``Politics is key because it concretizes the road to
liberation,'' he said told a reporter. ``We want liberation not only
in the realm of theology but in practice as well.''
   But Balduino, though admitting to past tensions between the
Brazilian church and the Vatican, said he saw no danger of a major
confrontation with Rome.
   ``The pope has benefited from our interchanges and so have we,''
he said.
   Bishop Adriano Hypolito of Nova Iguacu near Rio, who was briefly
kidnapped and tortured in 1976 by right-wing vigilantes because of
his criticism of the military government, said, ``All the church's
social work is political. We have the right to form people and that
formation has to be for the common good.''
   Hypolito was one of five Brazilian bishops to receive critical
letters from the Vatican last October. He did not want to discuss
the contents in an interview, but Brazilian press accounts have said
he had been sharply rebuked for ``opening paths for ideological
groups'' in his diocese.
   ``The letter was not really serious,'' he said. ``It was like a
note from a father to a son, reminding him to take care crossing the
street. I have no fears about the future.''
   Another sign the progressives intend to continue their political
activism came a week after the conference.
   Bishop Mauro Morelli, whose diocese was host to the conference,
endorsed the presidential campaign of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of
the socialist Workers' Party in the Nov. 15 presidential elections,
although the pope has frequently insisted that church leaders stay
out of party politics.
   ``The Workers' Party was born out of the people's struggle and
has serious proposals,'' Morelli said in his endorsement. ``I don't
vote for friends but for ideologies.''

<DATELINE>ST. JOHN, Jersey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The realities of modern farming are
intruding upon the cosy world of the Channel Islands where men and
women lovingly raise real Jersey and Guernsey cows.
   Today's dairy farmers on the British-crown islands off France
have become much more competitive, and as they have modernized, they
have concentrated their cows into a smaller number but larger, more
efficient herds.
   That, the farmers say, ultimately is not good for the two famous
breeds.
   Still the cows are delicately looked after.
   Every evening at about 7 o'clock Philip Romeril goes out to the
field behind his 18th-century farmhouse to check on his 60 Jerseys.
   Their golden brown hides glow in the soft, receding summer light.
Their tails swish and their round, brown eyes blink. They have names
like Carol and Marie, and they ooze contentment.
   Romeril scratches the tops of a few heads, tugs at a floppy ear
here and there, runs his hand over a pregnant cow's bulge.
   And then he has a chat with them.
   ``People think I'm crazy because I talk to my cows,'' Romeril
said. ``But it's important. A cow that runs away from you is not a
happy cow.''
   Explained Anne Perchard, another Jersey dairy farmer, who serves
as chairman of the World Jersey Cattle Bureau, ``There has to be a
tremendous feeling towards the cow itself, otherwise there are
easier ways of making a living.''
   In addition to modernization on dairy farms, young people are
being lured from the land by the islands' booming financial services
and tourist industries and that also could endanger the future of
Guernseys and Jerseys.
   Other factors also are conspiring against the islands' cow
farmers. Guernsey has lost some 50 cows, and Jersey a handful, to
bovine spongiform encepholopathy, or a softening of the brain
tissues apparently linked to a cow feed.
   It is believed that the disease, which has struck in England as
well, is not contagious and isn't passed on to offspring. But
farmers aren't entirely sure.
   Also, the approach of 1992, when the 12-nation European Economic
Community dismantles all trade barriers, has raised fears of milk
imports.
   The islands, which are not members of the community and are
dependencies of the British crown, currently are protected from such
imports. On each, the farmers sell their milk to one milk marketing
board.
   In an effort to improve their herds, Jersey farmers are
considering following Guernsey's lead and mating their cows with
outside bulls for the first time in nearly 200 years.
   ``The small dairy farmer is struggling to make a living,''
Romeril said.
   Said farmer William Luff, secretary of World Guernsey Cattle
Federation, ``The number of farms is being reduced all the time.''
   Jersey, the bigger of the two islands, has about 7,000 cows. They
are smallish and brown, some have white markings. Islanders describe
their faces as dishy.
   Guernsey has about 4,000, which have similar coloring, but they
tend to be heftier and have Roman noses.
   There were about twice as many island cows in the 19th century,
when thousands were exported mostly to England, the United States,
Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Denmark.
   In the old days, the average Jersey herd was made up of a dozen
or so cows. Now it has 40.
   There are 100 dairy farmers on Jersey, compared with 1,005 in
1952. On Guernsey, there are 85 farmers vs. 353 in 1952.
   ``Some people say that in 20 years, there will 25 large herds
supplying the island,'' Mrs. Perchard said. ``That would be very sad
because the whole idea of the island cow in her setting would
evaporate.''
   Romeril said, ``Genetically I think we would suffer because you
would have a lot more concentration on certain blood lines. Each
bull would sire more cows.''
   Apart from young people leaving agriculture, there are also
worries that high property prices will tempt farmers to sell their
land.
   ``Perhaps there won't be enough people to maintain the island
herd in 15 years time,'' Guernsey's Luff said.
   Jersey's Parliament twice has voted down a proposal to import
semen to improve the herd, and proponents have agreed to wait for
the completion of a five-year genetic study before raising the issue
again.
   ``This is the veritable cradle of the breed,'' Mrs. Perchard
said. ``The fact that we are a closed herd, this is something that
is looked at with envy. But one wonders whether (semen imports)
would improve our product.''
   Guernsey imported semen in 1976, from an English-bred Guernsey
bull, and Luff said the Guernsey breed has improved as a result.
   Of course, each island thinks its own breed is superior _ a
rivalry as traditional as the supper time check on cows.
   ``We all go around last thing,'' said Peter Lee, a Jersey farmer.
``They're all members of the family.''

<HEAD>Solomon Islands Fear Greenhouse Effect Will Increase Malaria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUADALCANAL, Solomon Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solomon Islands have the
world's highest incidence of malaria and some experts fear the
mosquito-borne disease might spread at a greater rate here and
elsewhere if the Earth is made warmer and wetter by the greenhouse
effect.
   ``I don't see eradication of mosquitos that carry the disease
will come for 50 or 60 years,'' said Dr. Ezekiel Nukuro,
undersecretary of Health Improvement in the Solomon Islands
government.
   ``A vaccine could be generations away.''
   The Solomons is one of three heavily malarial Pacific island
countries. Papau New Guinea and Vanuatu are the others.
   Health authorities estimate 337 out of every 1,000 people in the
Solomon Islands have malaria. The disease is responsible for 51
percent of the islands' deaths.
   Malaria is not a new to the Solomons.
   In 1568 the Portuguese explorer Mendana, who thought the islands
hid the fabled King Solomons mines, reported a disease that fits the
symptoms of malaria _ high fever, chills, pains, profuse sweating,
and often death.
   When U.S. troops came ashore on Guadalcanal to fight the Japanese
in 1942, more fell to malaria than enemy action. The Solomon
Islands' Ministry of Health records show that 772 of every 1,000
American soldiers were affected.
   It took three years of spraying with DDT and dosing soldiers with
anti-malarial tablets to reduce the incidence to 20 per 1,000 by the
time the war ended in 1945.
   The malaria parasite enters the body through the mosquito's
saliva and travels in the blood to the liver.
   For countries like the Solomon Islands with an annual per capita
income of about $500, the cost of controlling the disease or
providing anti-malarial drugs to the population of 317,000 is beyond
the means of the government, according to a report delivered at a
conference on malaria in the Pacific.
   The Solomons tried eradicating it by aerial spraying in the
1970s. But the disease returned when spraying stopped. Efforts are
now being concentrated on chemicals to kill the mosquito larvae.
Other methods such as mosquito nets, window and door screens and
long sleeve shirts are being encouraged. But most of the population
live in grass huts, wear t-shirts and shorts and remain easy prey
for mosqutios.
   Some researchers, including Dr. Ross Coppel of the Walter and
Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne Australia, one of the world's
leading malaria research establishments, fear drug resistance will
spread and so will malaria.
   Coppel, who is part of a team working on the development of a
malaria vaccine, predicted warming of the atmosphere by the
greenhouse effect will make the planet wetter, more habitable for
mosquitos and thus spread the parasite.
   ``It is absolutely clear that it will speed up the spread of
malaria if the planet gets hotter and wetter. It will make perfect
breeding conditions for the mosquitos,'' he said.
   ``The parasite can't breed below 22 degrees Centigrade (71.6
degrees Fahrenheit). What will happen if the Earth warms as
predicted is that the rainfall pattern will change.''
   Areas will become hotter and warmer and the parasite eggs, which
are laid and hatched in water, will flourish, he said.
   Coppel said the disease could be reintroduced to the poorer areas
of the Mediterranean and the north of Australia, from which it had
been eradicted many years ago.
   ``We need to work on a vaccine but use bed netting, repellants
and sprays in a multi-prong effort,'' he added. ``The outlook is not
very optimistic.''
   Many hotels in the Solomon Islands provide guests with mosquito
spray and a warning that malaria is a deadly disease. Visitors are
urged to spray themselves generously.
   `` You can still go to a malarial area and be reasonably safe if
you take drugs, use netting and insect repellent,'' Coppel said.

<HEAD>Presidents Are Never Really on Vacation</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nobody really begrudges presidents their
vacations. After all, the man who holds the job never is really off
duty anyhow. Nor is he ever off stage, even on holiday.
   But presidential days away are watched and counted as though an
office bookkeeper were making sure an employee hadn't overstayed his
quota of paid vacation weeks. There isn't any limit for presidents,
of course. They set their own schedules for their breaks from the
office routine, and the office travels with them.
   President Bush is ending the second week of a three-week vacation
at Kennebunkport, Maine, his family retreat since boyhood. ``For
Barbara and me this has been a delightful vacation, a place that we
love very much,'' said Bush, who has been more talkative and more
accessible than most of his modern predecessors were when
vacationing.
   As president, Ronald Reagan spent vacations in the isolated
privacy of his 688-acre ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif. During
eight years in office, he spent 335 days at the ranch.
   Jimmy Carter vacationed at St. Simons Island, and later at Sapelo
Island, off the Georgia coast, renting retreats there. He also spent
some of his breaks at home in Plains, Ga., which enjoyed something
of a tourist boom during his single term.
   Gerald R. Ford visited Vail, Colo.; Richard M. Nixon bought
himself a place in Key Biscayne, Fla., and later switched coasts to
San Clemente, Calif. Lyndon B. Johnson had his LBJ Ranch in Texas.
And John F. Kennedy's vacation White House was the family compound
of oceanfront homes in Hyannisport, Mass., on Cape Cod.
   Presidential vacations are as luxurious, and as private, as the
president wants them to be.
   Bush has been golfing, boating, fishing, often commenting on what
he called ``a total vacation.'' But he also held a news conference
at his Walker's Point home, invited two prime ministers as house
guests, and said he'd be working with some Cabinet members this week
on the drug-fighting program that will be announced Sept. 5.
   While a vacationing president has some White House work to do
each day _ and aides at hand because there's more where that came
from _ recent ones seem to have broken the old pattern in which a
sheaf of announcements was trundled along on the holiday, to be
rationed out one at a time to give the impression that decisions
were flowing daily.
   Security can be a costly problem, especially when the
presidential retreat is close by tourist territory, as Bush's is and
as Kennedy's was.
   When the vacation White House came to Hyannisport, the neighbors
met in a village church and considered asking that the streets be
blocked off to bring back their peace and quiet. That didn't happen
except at the Kennedy compound.
   Bush said last week he hopes his Kennebunkport neighbors haven't
been inconvenienced. He also said he hopes Congress will vote funds
to help pay local security expenses. ``There's no question that
there's a security burden placed on this small community here and,
indeed, some of the surrounding communities, by the presence of the
president,'' he said.
   The president said he feels safe and comfortable in his Maine
surroundings, although ``I can't stroll as _ you know, quite as
freely as I used to before I was in government work.''
   ``What bothers me a little bit is that you just can't jump in the
car over there and drive downtown ... but that goes with the
territory.''
   The territory also seems to include questions about luxury and
isolation from average people. When Bush was asked one last
Wednesday, he said he's doing his best to keep in touch.
   ``I've got a lot of friends from all walks of life and, you know,
there is a little tendency in this job to get isolated ...,'' he
said. ``But I don't think people feel anything other than isn't it
nice to have a good vacation. And I try to have as much contact as I
can.''
   Bush has spent vacations at Kennebunkport all his life, missing
only the years of his World War II service. His first presidential
vacation had to be one of his better ones, certainly more relaxed
than the break he took while trying to get to the White House.
   He looked back after getting what should rank as the perfect
question for a vacation news conference: Why do the polls show that
Americans think he's doing a great job?
   ``Thank you for asking that question ...,'' he smiled. ``But
these things change.'' In the summer of '88 he was the Republican
presidential nominee, lagging in the polls and in need of a comeback.
   ``Look, you're looking at a guy who was standing on this lawn
about a year ago at this time ... and the numbers were quite
different, in a different setting, a different situation. What goes
up can come down.''

   If you think they're rushing Christmas with those
catalogs before Labor Day, you should see the financial mail. It's
about taxes.
   That's right, federal income taxes. April 15 in August.
   But as much as that sounds like madness, there is some method in
it. Many taxpayers and the people who advise them have learned from
experience that it is never too soon to start arranging your affairs
to minimize the burden when it comes time to settle up with Uncle
Sam.
   ``The ideal would be to start in January,'' said William Brennan,
a specialist in the subject with the accounting firm of Ernst &amp;
Young.
   Tax planning _ some might call it finagling _ is often portrayed
as a shadowy activity practiced only by the rich at the expense of
the ordinary wage-earner.
   Note, for example, the court case this summer in which Leona
Helmsley, the New York hotelier accused of tax evasion, was quoted
by a witness as saying that ``only the little people'' pay taxes.
   Or consider the fuss over whether Malcolm Forbes, the magazine
publisher and bon vivant, might have been entitled to deduct some of
the expenses of his Morocco birthday extravaganza as a business
expense (he said he wouldn't anyway).
   The morals of the matter may depend on your personal viewpoint.
The law on this point, however, is pretty clear.
   It was settled long ago by the noted appeals court judge Learned
Hand, who decreed that everybody has a perfect right to take all
measures available within the law to minimize the taxes they owe.
   For most of the 1980s, the big tax planning problem has been
adjusting to some just-passed sweeping overhaul of the tax system.
This year, for a change, there isn't much that is drastically new.
   But there is a lot of uncertainty over changes that might be made
in the future.
   The betting among the experts is that sooner or later the low
basic income tax rates set by the 1986 tax reform law will be raised
again in some way.
   ``Before new tax laws became an annual event, sound tax strategy
generally called for deferring part of income and accelerating
certain expense items to shift some of the tax burden to the next
year,'' said analysts at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. in the firm's
weekly publication The Outlook.
   ``Now the decision is less clear-cut. But despite prospects for
higher taxes to come, shifting income forward and expenses back is
still the best tax strategy in most cases.''
   This kind of maneuver can be as simple as stepping up charitable
contributions so that they are made before New Year's.
   ``It's easier to accelerate deductions than to defer income,''
observed the accounting firm Laventhol &amp; Horwath in a recent yearend
planning report.
   ``The reason is obvious: You control the money you pay out, but
not the money you take in.''
   Self-employed people have more flexibility in this regard. If
their checkbooks can stand the wait, they can simply delay sending
out bills to customers or clients so that the money won't be paid
until after 1990 has begun.
   One long-cherished deduction for many people continues to fade,
on its way to extinction by 1991. Consumer interest is 20 percent
deductible this year, and only 10 percent next.
   Says Standard &amp; Poor's: ``Many tax advisors now recommend either
paying off such loans early or consolidating them under a home
equity loan of up to $100,000, on which the interest is fully
deductible, regardless of how loan proceeds are used.''

<HEAD>Kenya Official Says Game Parks Safe Despite Upsurge in Violence</HEAD>

   The government's leading wildlife official
says Kenya's game parks remain safe despite four fatal attacks since
July, including the slaying of conservationist George Adamson.
   Richard Leakey, the director of wildlife, blamed the attacks on
elephant poachers who have turned to banditry after being driven out
of the animal reserves by Kenya's campaign to save its elephant
population.
   He noted that the three fatal attacks before Adamson was slain
Aug. 20 took place in particularly remote areas and far from the
usual tourist or safari trails.
   His death and the killings of a Connecticut woman and a French
couple in July raised fears for the health of Kenya's tourist
industry, the country's No. 1 income earner.
   But Leakey said he saw no reason for visitors to fear for their
safety so long as they stay in regular tourist areas and on main
roads.
   ``I have traveled widely in the last few weeks to assess the
situation for myself,'' he said after Adamson's death. ``Most of our
wildlife areas where the majority of tourists go are in my judgment
reasonably safe and there should be no need for tourists to fear
going there.''
   The 83-year-old Adamson was shot to death near his camp at the
remote Kora National Reserve in eastern Kenya while trying to help
an assistant and a guest who were being robbed by three gunmen.
   Adamson, a retired game warden, had lived in Kenya since 1924
and, with his wife, Joy, helped to popularize conservation through
their practice of releasing captive lions into the wild. Joy, who
was killed by a servant in 1980, detailed the unique practice in the
books ``Born Free,'' ``Living Free,'' and ``Forever Free,'' which
subsequently were made into movies.
   In July, a French husband and wife were killed in the Meru game
park, east of Mount Kenya, when they stumbled onto a group of
poachers while driving down a seldom-used track.
   Little more than two weeks later, on July 27, nine men attacked a
19-member tour group organized by the Connecticut Audubon Society on
a 40-mile stretch of dirt road between the southern national parks
of Tsavo and Amboseli, killing Marie Esther Ferraro of Bethany, Conn.
   Seven tourists have been wounded in separate attacks since
September a year ago. Tour operators say several hundred tourists,
mostly Americans, have been frightened off by the violence.
   Although the cancellations were quickly replaced by new bookings,
the tour operators expressed fears Adamson's death would prompt
other tourists to cancel or defer plans to visit Kenya.
   ``They call and want to know if it's safe to come to Kenya,''
said the manager of one large safari company who spoke on condition
he not be identified by name. ``We try to reassure them.''
   Another safari group said it received 50 cancellations in the
four days after Adamson died.
   Tourism is of prime concern to the government.
   Last year, a record 660,000 tourists visited Kenya's game parks
and Indian Ocean beach resorts and brought in an estimated $350
million, outstripping income from the main export, coffee.
   The tour operators expressed their anxieties recently at a
meeting with Leakey, who sought to allay their fears.
   He said roads, allowed to fall into disrepair in recent years,
were being regraded and resurfaced to provide quicker and therefore
safer journeys. Plainclothes security officers have been posted in
most of the major tourist lodges in Kenya's game parks, he said.
   In an interview later, Leakey claimed that because of the
intensified anti-poaching operation, Kenya's tourist attractions
actually are safer now than six months ago. Most of the attacks, he
said, had occurred outside the national parks.
   Using more than 300 new weapons and 45 new vehicles, along with
increased air surveillance and renewed foot patrols, Kenya has
brought poaching virtually to a halt since Leakey's appointment in
March.
   The number of elephants killed has dropped from an average three
a day to three since June, he said. In the last decade, the
slaughter by poachers reduced Kenya's elephant population from
65,000 to 17,000.
   About three dozen poachers have been killed in the combined
effort by the department of wildlife, police and paramilitary units,
said Leakey. In the last few months no game rangers have died at
poachers' hands.
   The revitalized effort has brought poachers under new pressures,
Leakey said.
   ``Previously people weren't being hurt because they didn't
feature high on poachers' lists because elephants were so easy to
get,'' he said.
   Now, he added, ``they don't know where to go, they have nothing,
they're short of cash and they've turned to robbery.''
   Leakey said the government believed it was dealing with fewer
than 100 of the armed bandits, whom he identified as indigent
Somalis called Shifta who have fled their war-torn, impoverished
country to exploit Kenya's elephants for their ivory tusks. Ivory
fetches $110 to $155 a pound on the world market, a record price.
   ``Until very recently, there was very easy money to be made in
the national parks by killing elephants,'' Leakey said. ``Nobody was
after them. There was no danger. It's very risky now to go into
Tsavo if you're a poacher.''
   Although Shifta have robbed and harrassed citizens in eastern
Kenya since the early 1960s, David Stiles, an anthropologist who has
studied Shiftas for nearly two decades, said many of those
perpetrating the violence were deserters from Somalia's army which
is fighting a rebellion in northern Somalia.
   Leakey said the Shifta were spread along a swath of arid, remote
territory from Tsavo's periphery up to Meru and posed little threat
to those who stayed on main roads and tourist byways.

<TEXT>
   In a quiet, though dramatic,
reversal of policy, Brazil is now accepting foreign offers of help
to save the Amazon wilderness, the world's largest, from destruction.
   The government, which early this year rebuffed a United Nations
proposal to swap some of its $112-billion foreign debt for
investments in Amazon protection programs, recently told Britain and
West Germany it would work with them to curb damage, mostly by
burning, to the huge rain forest.
   In August, Brazil accepted Italian and Canadian planes for local
authorities to police the jungle. Then it said yes to a project
backed by the United Nations and by private American companies to
establish a 1.1 million-acre protected forest area to produce rubber
and nuts.
   The moves represent a sharp reversal in President Jose Sarney's
Amazon policy, which in the past considered offers by foreigners as
attempts to take control of the rain forest from Brazil.
   ``We cannot accept this form of colonialism which they want to
create here,'' Sarney told reporters in March, after France, the
Netherlands and two U.S. congressional delegations suggested trading
some Brazilian foreign debt, the Third World's largest, for Amazon
preservation.
   But analysts say subtle shifts in political, social and economic
spheres are forcing the government to change its mind.
   ``A bit of the persecution complex that took over the government,
which led to xenophobic and irrational behavior, is being overcome,
opening the road to new initiatives,'' wrote the Brazilian physicist
Jose Goldemberg in the O Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper recently.
   There is belief here that Sarney, widely discredited for his
inability to check 1,004 percent annual inflation, talked tough in
the past to placate right-wing supporters.
   But with his center-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party in
splinters and the country's first popular presidential election
since 1960 set for Nov. 15, Sarney might now be resigned to accept
foreign aid, the analysts say.
   ``What you have is a lame-duck government that lacks the
legitimacy to start new initiatives and push them through
Congress,'' Rene Dreifuss, a political scientist at the Fluminense
University in Rio, told The Associated Press. ``It has no choice but
to accept help from abroad.''
   Equally important, the hostility marking the issue has undermined
Brazil's trade links abroad.
   ``It started to become taboo to do business in the Amazon,'' Sen.
Leopoldo Peres, a member of the Democratic Movement and president of
a Senate committee on Amazon deforestation, said in an interview.
``American and European banks and lending organizations started
hesitating on financing industrial projects in the jungle.''
   Environmentalists pressured the European Economic Community to
ban imports of iron ore produced at the Greater Carajas project, a
huge metallurgy project in Para, a state in the Amazon region.
   Recently, trade officials from Belgium, West Germany and Britain
visited the 200 million-acre, $70 billion project, where thousands
of acres of virgin forest southwest of the mouth of the Amazon River
are being burned for the charcoal needed to process ore.
   A Rio de Janeiro city councilman, Alfredo Sirkis of Brazil's
Green Party, contends Sarney first stiffened on the Amazon issue
under a barrage of international news coverage of the shooting death
of the acclaimed union leader and ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
Mendes.
   Mendes, who fought to keep cattle ranchers from cutting down the
forest for pasture, was killed last December outside his modest home
in a backwoods Amazon town.
   ``All of a sudden Chico was all over the front pages, and U.S.
senators were showing up to talk about saving the Amazon,'' Sirkis
said. ``It irritated the military, and Sarney reacted by turning it
into a sovereignty issue.''
   But the British rock star Sting met with Sarney in January and
received permission to begin a worldwide campaign to raise funds for
an Indian reservation.
   In February, Indian tribes of the eastern Amazon Basin organized
the first national tribal conference, with a goal of blocking World
Bank loans for a series of hydroelectric dams planned for the Amazon
region.
   These efforts added to a growing worldwide concern that
uncontrolled tree burning in the 2 million square-mile Amazon forest
_ for farming, ranching, highway building and mining _ was changing
global weather patterns.
   Environmentalists contend deforestation of the Amazon also is
destroying unique plant and animal life, much of it unstudied, and
eliminating a major source of oxygen for the Earth's atmosphere.
   Satellite surveys show that more than 5 percent of Brazil's rain
forest has been cut and burned. Some scientists say this adds carbon
to the atmosphere and helps cause the global warming trend known as
the greenhouse effect.
   By April, the first visible sign of change came when Sarney
announced a multimillion-dollar plan to preserve the rain forest.
   His ``Our Nature'' project extended the suspension of tax
incentives for ranchers and created a special police force to fight
the burning. It also established new forest and Indian reservations
and an Environmental Fund, banned timber exports, and controlled the
sale of mercury, which is indiscriminately dumped into Amazon-area
rivers by freelance gold prospectors.
   ``When the hysteria in the press and the government faded, the
nationalist jingo turned to apolitical dialogue,'' Flavio Feldmann
of the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, a vocal ecology defender,
told a reporter.
   On July 5, Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu de Sodre signed a
memorandum of understanding with Britain to tackle ``urban and
industrial environmental problems, control of marine pollution, and
forestry management.''
   ``This cooperation does not affect the sovereign right of states
to administer their natural heritage,'' said Abreu de Sodre.
   In August, Brazil accepted $65.5 million in grants and loans from
West Germany for conservation projects in the Amazon over three
years.
   After this, the Inter-American Development Bank said it would
study the creation of a new fund for environmental projects in Latin
America and the Caribbean.
   Many Brazilian politicians now say the country will open up more
to foreign technological and financial help, although some seemingly
remain wary of the so-called ``sovereignty issue.''
   But Christopher Patten, Britain's minister of overseas
development, a recent visitor to Brazil, said, ``Environmental
problems are ... the world's problem, which has to be solved by
cooperation and not throwing bricks at each other.''

   Rajiv Gandhi, the prime minister, flew to
southern India and became Rajiv Gandhi, the candidate, hopscotching
by helicopter across friendly and hostile political turf as part of
his upcoming re-election bid.
   With forceful voice and blistering rhetoric at odds with his
congenial, pink-cheeked appearance, Candidate Gandhi denounced those
who oppose him as relics of a feudal past, consorters with traitors
and assassins, potential instigators of religious wars.
   Under Indian law, he must call elections no later than Jan. 4.
   In less than five years, Gandhi has grown from political novice
to confident campaigner as he seeks to perpetuate the dynasty that
began in 1947 when his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, became India's
first prime minister as the vast Asian subcontinent was freed from
British colonial rule.
   The Nehru-Gandhi family's domination of the prime ministership
has been interrupted only twice _ for a total of three years. It was
personified and perpetuated by Nehru's daughter, the iron-willed
Indira Gandhi whose assassination in 1984 propelled Rajiv Gandhi, an
ex-airline pilot, into the leadership of the world's largest, albeit
flawed and unruly, democracy.
   The young man who rode to victory on a wave of sympathy for his
mother's slaying is now, at the age of 45, being put to the test of
harsher political realities.
   At last count, the Elections Commission was considering
applications of 216 parties or would-be parties for places on the
ballot for the elections. The problem for the opposition _ and the
advantage for Gandhi _ is that the closest thing to a well-organized
national political party in India is the Congress Party he inherited
from his grandfather and mother.
   The next best at the moment is the Janata Dal, or National Front,
an ever-shifting alliance of about half a dozen parties or movements
constantly at war within itself.
   It was the Janata Dal that Gandhi assailed in 13 speeches during
a 31-hour swing in August across the southern states of Karnataka
and Andhra Pradesh.
   To be sure, Gandhi has been trading barbs with Janata Dal's
president, Viswanath Pratap Singh, his former defense and finance
minister, for about three years.
   But he has now launched a frontal attack on N.T. Rama Rao, Janata
Dal's chairman.
   Rama Rao, the chief minister, or top elected official, of Andhra
Pradesh, is highly popular across India as a movie star who has
portrayed just about every major deity in the Hindu pantheon. He is
timing the release of his next film for the election campaign.
   Rama Rao, who routinely dresses in facial paint and bright orange
robes invocatory of the gods he portrays, is also the leader of
Telegu Desam, a political party operating only in Andhra Pradesh.
Nevertheless, it won the second highest bloc of national Parliament
seats in the 1984 election: 30 to the Gandhi party's 415 in the
544-seat chamber.
   In speeches to Congress Party rallies _ officially scheduled as
``public meetings'' _ in four economically depressed Andhra Pradesh
towns, Gandhi accused Rama Rao's state government of corruption,
exploitation of the poor and failure to provide protection from a
murky Maoist band known as Naxalites.
   By the time he got to Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh's state capital,
Candidate Gandhi had nominally reverted to Prime Minister Gandhi.
Seated beside Rama Rao at a news conference, Gandhi repeated some of
the same charges. When a reporter tried to ask Rama Rao a question,
the head of the prime minister's information office, Gopalaswami
Parthasarathy, stepped forward to say: ``This is not a joint press
conference.''
   The next day, according to the anti-Gandhi national newspaper
Indian Express, the 70ish movie star sniped at the prime minister as
an ``inexperienced young brat.''
   Still, a national opinion poll conducted for the news magazine
India Today in August projected Gandhi's Congress Party would win
315, or 58 percent, of the seats in the election.
   Even if the opposition parties as a whole captured a majority, 58
percent of the 10,399 registered voters surveyed in the poll said
they doubted the opposition would be able to form a government. And
if they did, 69 percent thought any such government would fall apart
before its five-year term was up.

<HEAD>Strike Accord Seen as Blow to Union Corruption in Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. assembly plants, back in operation
after winning a three-week labor dispute, have blazed the trail for
other companies to fight the extraordinary power labor unions hold
in Mexico, industry spokesmen say.
   A union power struggle that shut down 15 American plants known as
maquiladoras in the border city of Reynosa ended with labor and
government officials agreeing Aug. 18 to let the workers form a
union independent of the nationally powerful Mexican Workers
Federation whose local representative forced the workers to strike.
   ``It definitely means that companies can take a stand against
illegal activities and corruption and be successsul,'' said Don
King, manager for Reynosa's West Bend plant.
   ``We blazed a new trail.''
   The strike was settled after intervention of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's government in Mexico City.
   Salinas has made clear he will not let unions stand in the way of
his goal of modernizing the Mexican economy and attracting more
foreign investors.
   ``The Salinas government has acted in a certain direction to
remove as much of the corruption as it possibly can,'' said Arnold
Kezsbom, president of the New York-based Service Manufacturing Corp.
whose Reynosa plant was closed in the strike.
   ``He doesn't want to have the negative publicity that occurred
out of this permeate throughout the world. The issue was the
expansion of the maquiladora industry in Mexico.''
   Maquiladoras, in which foreign-owned companies take advantage of
cheap Mexican labor to produce goods for sale in their own countries
or elsewhere, have become a top foreign income earner for Mexico.
   The industry, which generated $2.3 billion in foreign currency
last year, has grown by more than 70 percent since 1985 and employs
about 392,000 people, mainly along the U.S.-Mexican border.
   The strike cost an estimated $500,000 a day in lost production,
but plant managers said it was worth it because the outcome was
favorable to them.
   Although the plant workers indicated no great sympathy for a
walkout, they went on strike July 25 on the orders of Rafael
Morales, a local leader of the powerful Mexican Workers Federation.
   Strike flags were hoisted. Traditionally in Mexico, workers who
violate strike flags face severe consequences, including possible
physical harm, immediately or later.
   The plants, nevertheless, continued to pay the workers their
wages and benefits, averaging about $1.20 a hour, during the strike.
   Kezsbom said the American managers resisted Morales, who controls
most of the labor contracts at Reynosa's 27 other maquiladoras,
because they considered him corrupt.
   Morales forced companies to give him control of trucking
contracts, waste disposal and scrap resale, and to issue food
coupons good only at stores he controls. The coupons are part of the
employee benefit packages.
   The nearly 2,000 workers at the plants Morales shut down waited
for two weeks while plant managers and business leaders pleaded with
the federal government in Mexico City to step in.
   Then, frustrated by government inaction, about 900 workers ripped
down the strike flags, stormed back into their plants and went to
work.
   That same day Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios met
with industry leaders in Mexico City and promised the government
would intervene.
   Gov. Americo Villarreal of Tamaulipas summoned the managers to a
meeting in the state capital, Ciudad Victoria, the next day to work
out an accord giving the plant workers the right to form an
independent union.
   The agreement surprised those familiar with the strength of the
Mexican Workers Federation, the nation's largest labor organization
and a powerful sector of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
   Although the agreement stipulates that only workers from the
affected 15 plants can join the independent union, industry
spokesmen say it may open a new era of labor relations in Tamaulipas
and other Mexican states with maquiladora plants.

   The ancient oriental medical treatment,
acupuncture, is still something of a rarity among orthodox American
doctors. But the practice is spreading in at least one specialty _
veterinary medicine. The vets don't talk about it much, but their
appearance at racetracks around the country has become commonplace.

   Dr. Allen Schoen sticks some rather ordinary
looking needles into the neck of a big 3-year-old chestnut filly.
The thoroughbred, stabled at Belmont racetrack, had been laid up
with what had been diagnosed as hock problems.
   The hock is sort of a backward ankle on a horse's hind leg, a
long way from the neck. The treatment was acupuncture, a practice
that has been proliferating in recent years among veterinarians.
   The hock-hurt filly had been through a run of conventional
veterinarians says Schoen, president of the International Veterinary
Acupuncture Society. ``Everything helped temporarily, but the
problem kept coming back.''
   Now the filly is running at Belmont and the hocks are holding
fine.
   Most owners want it kept secret if their horses are treated by
acupuncture, but its use has become widespread on racetracks across
the country, as well as in small-animal practices and on livestock.
   ``Eight years ago, you hardly ever saw a vet out here practicing
acupuncture,'' says Billy Turner, an experienced trainer who guided
Secretariat to the 1973 Triple Crown. ``Now, they're all over the
place.'' Turner uses acupuncture on horses he trains, not only as a
cure, but as a diagnostic tool as well.
   ``They can't solve everything, but they solve a lot,'' Turner
says. ``They made a believer out of me.''
   But why won't they talk about it?
   ``You know how to spell trainer?'' asks another trainer, Phil
Johnson. ``Note that it has an ``i'' in it. It's never the horse,
the jockey, the breeding. It's the ``I'' in the trainer that got
that horse into the winner's circle. Why would they tell you
something like acupuncture helped?''
   A cynical view, but certainly one with a horseshoe's worth of
truth. The other reluctance is that the administration of
acupuncture may indicate a certain unsoundness.
   Dr. Marvin Cain of Cincinnati is to equine acupuncture what the
Mayo Clinic is to generalized medicine.
   Cain has been a vet for 35 years, mostly operating a small-animal
practice in Cincinnati, until he decided to go full-time into
``performance horses,'' which have included the Italian equestrian
team as well as show horses and racehorses. Before selling his
practice, however, he inserted needles into dogs, cats, parakeets
and parrots, chinchillas and hamsters and even a pheasant whose
eventual fate was to be served under glass.
   Cain was a skeptic of the ancient Oriental remedy and admits he
took his first lessons reluctantly.
   ``I felt there was no such thing as a problem without a solution,
and I was finding too many problems without predictable solutions
when a chiropractor friend suggested I explore the possibilities of
acupuncture,'' he says.
   He couldn't argue with the results he immediately saw.
   ``In some animals, it was as though someone had said take up your
bed and walk,'' reports Cain. ``I was seeing miracles every day.''
He subsequently studied under master acupuncturists in Seoul, Tokyo,
Hong Kong and Taipei. His studies were on humans and he was issued a
license by the Chinese Academy of Acupuncture. He then translated
this knowledge to animals.
   Johnson, the trainer, has seen Cain work.
   ``The horses see me every day, but when they see him approaching,
they seem to know it's Dr. Do Good,'' Johnson says. ``Cain never
wants to know what the problem is, he wants to find it himself.''
   Cain explains that with acupuncture he addresses the cause, not
the symptom. It's a lot more lucrative to treat a symptom than to
treat a cause, he says.
   ``If a symptom is treated, then a symptom must be continually
treated. If you remove the cause then the effect is no longer there.
In acupuncture, we do not practice symptomatic medicine. We do not
deliver a drug to relieve pain. The cause of the pain becomes worse.
The greatest goal of my professional life is to put myself out of
business,'' Cain says.
   ``My dollar signs have decreased since I began full-time on
acupuncture, but the true wealth I live with and die with has
increased beyond everything a dollar sign could suggest,'' he says.
``This has given me a sense of worth, a contribution to the
advancement of life.''

<TEXT>ELMONT: of life.''    Not that Cain is unrealistic.    ``Acupuncture
hasn't replaced anything we've already learned, just as surgery did not
replace anything we already learned. It just added another important piece
of the professional pie. I try and teach young vets not to become polarized
and use acupuncture for everything, but rather to use it in conjunction
with what we already know.''    Cain also concedes, in effect, that there
is something in acupuncture that just might be called a touch.    Some
argue flat out that it is an art _ or even voodoo _ but not science. 
  Cain agrees there is a certain art to it. He compares it to playing the
piano.    ``You can take lessons forever and practice forever, but most
people will never be able to write or compose like Mozart,'' he says. 
  According to horse trainers, Cain is the Mozart of Belmont.    Cain
says that when he first started, his Chinese instructors told him it would
take seven years to become a master acupuncturist. He didn't believe it
at the time, but he says he does now. He says many subtleties are
picked up by experience.    Likewise, he says, acupuncture will never
create a great racehorse.    ``There's nothing I can do to make a horse
run faster than its capacity. It's never been my intent to make any creatures
outperform its ability. It's simply to put them in a state of balance so
they can perform at their optimum, to perform without drugs.''    The
American Veterinary Medical Association, representing more than 45,000
veterinarians, recognized acupuncture as a valid form of veterinary medicine
in July 1988, but still the only courses taught at the nation's 27 schools
of veterinary medicine are electives.    The IVAS offers an extensive
course somewhere in the United States every other year, with the next one
in Tampa, Fla. On odd years, it is offered on foreign soil. The 120-hour
course costs about $2,000 and at the end, trainees must pass both written
and practical exams.    ``Veterinarians in Europe had accepted acupuncture
far more widely than the Americans,'' Cain says. ``They are not so
rigidly governed by their medical associations.''    Schoen says about
200 vets in the United States have been certified by the IVAS, but that
far more vets have learned a little bit of acupuncture and are using it
in smaller ways.    Acupuncture has also been reported to be successful
in treating prize livestock with fertility problems.    Dr. Sheldon Altman
of Burbank, Calif., who has a small-animal practice, feels there is a growing
demand for acupuncture within the profession.    ``I'm the garbage dump
of southern California,'' Altman says. ``It's becoming 80 percent of my
practice, but by the time they get to me, things are sometimes pretty bad.
I don't get that many miracles. Usually, I work on chronic pain problems,
such as arthritis, degenerative joint diseases, slipped disks.''    Altman
himself has landed in the emergency ward twice when dogs in severe pain
did not think that needles were a particularly good idea. Now, he says,
he will not treat a dog that is too nervous.    ``There's too much
adrenalin and the acupuncture probably won't be very effective,'' he says.
   All of the vets agree that the father of veterinary acupuncture in
the United States was the late H. Grady Young of Thomasville, Ga. He started
using acupuncture nearly 50 years ago, at a time when most Americans had
never even heard of it.    In fact, he couldn't even find a book about
it. He found a primer on acupuncture in a used-book store in London and
began experimenting. His first animal patient was a black Labrador retriever
scheduled to be destroyed due to a severe reaction to an immunization shot.
   Altman couldn't believe his eyes when the dog seemed to recover instantly.
In fact, he was so sure the cure was temporary that he did not tell the
owner for six weeks. Then he called the owner to say his pet was alive
and well.    ``Grady just learned by reading books and practicing,'' Cain
says. ``I'm desperately trying to fulfill Grady's dream of spreading the
use of acupuncture.''

   Arab-Americans have been part of the fabric of
American society for more than 100 years, but the current wave of
immigrants, fleeing the destruction and death in their homelands,
has reawakened their ethnic sense and brought problems. In
microcosm, here is a look this slice of America today.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By A.J. DICKERSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arab-American community center is burned,
twice. A couple returns home from their mosque to find ``Go back''
scrawled in shoe polish on their walls and carpet.
   ``They put sludge in my pita bread, took my lunchmeat out. They
wrote `sand nigger' on my timecard,'' said Lebanese-American Fred
Abbas, a Wayne County sewer plant worker who won $500,000 in a
discrimination suit. The county is seeking a new trial.
   But, nationally, anti-Arab sentiments are dwindling as people
stop stereotyping Arab-Americans. So says Faris Bouhafa of the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington, D.C.,
which represents 2.5 million people.
   In the early years of their immigration, Arab-Americans of their
many nationalities tended to cluster together as other ethnic groups
did. But as they fanned out over the country, the second and third
generations, acquiring education, tended to assimilate, although
keeping their ethnic devotion to regional culinary tastes, from lamb
dishes to pita bread.
   Now, some Arab-American experts say, the Lebanese and Palestinian
havoc and the violence throughout the Middle East has reawakened a
sense of identity.
   In greater Detroit, home by most counts to some 250,000
Arab-Americans, the largest concentration in North America, the
immigrants keep coming and tensions remain. So says Terry Ahwal, a
board member on the ADC's Detroit chapter, and a Catholic who
emigrated from Palestine to the United States in 1972 when she was
15.
   Of the 22 Arab nations, most immigrants here are from Lebanon,
Syria, Palestine-Jordan, Yemen and the Chaldea, the ancient area
between the Tigris and Euphrates that constituted Babylon. Some
Arabs are Christians; others practice Islam. The Chaldeans are Roman
Catholics from Iraq.
   ``Detroit is the Ellis Island of the Arab community. At first, it
was economics _ the car industry gave jobs to lots of unskilled
people. And people bring families,'' says Ahwal, whose chapter
received threatening letters after a bomb brought down Pan Am Flight
103 in December in Scotland.
   ``We always get threats. It's normal. It's a comedy here. We pass
them around and laugh,'' says Ismael Ahmed, director of the Arab
Community Center for Economic and Social Services, better known as
ACCESS.
   ACCESS, founded in 1971, moved into its third home in Dearborn
last summer. The first two burned, says Ahmed, who blames arsonists.
``I think people are frightened. Whole blocks become Arab very
quickly,'' says the Brooklyn-born Ahmed, who is Lebanese-Egyptian.
   Each year, 3,000 to 10,000 Arabs land in Detroit, many from
Lebanon.
   More problems.
   The number one issue is unemployment because of the language.
``Most come from villages that have lived the same way for hundreds
of years,'' Ahmed says. ``Their skills aren't very transferable.''
   But that was so when the first immigrants arrived. Their basic
talents were agricultural and mercantile, so they took jobs at
anything from grocery stores to peddling pots and pans in rural
areas.
   Arab immigration to the United States began with a trickle more
than 100 years ago. When peddlers found business good, they stayed.
A wave came from the Lebanon region after 1900, some to escape the
crumbling Ottoman Empire's oppression. In 1919, emigres built the
nation's first mosque, in the Detroit enclave of Highland Park.
   ``I think the thing that attracted people to this area was it was
a nice place to live,'' says Henry Saad, a Bloomfield Hills lawyer
and a third-generation Lebanese.
   The thousands who followed them to greater Detroit were lured by
auto industry wages.
   ``Detroit was booming. The real question is why they continue to
come here,'' says Nabeel Abraham, an anthropologist at Henry Ford
Community College. ``These people wouldn't be here except for the
war. ... That's my suspicion.
   ``One of the factors making Detroit different is we have this
constant influx of immigrants and they pull you back from
assimilation,'' Abraham says. ``They're always trying to re-create
home.''

<TEXT>DETROIT: re-create home.''    Newer immigrants create some stress
in Dearborn, dotted with Arabic coffeehouses, restaurants and markets and
home to some 20,000 Arabs. ``Their view of Islam often differs from the
others,'' he says, recalling one mosque whose congregation was assimilated,
longtime Arab immigrants.    ``Now you go back and it looks like a scene
out of southern Lebanon,'' Abraham says. Arab Christians also maintained
their own churches and many still do.    New arrivals come to join families
here, or seek comfort in a place with the familiarity of their homeland.
But they find life harder than did their predecessors.    ``What you see
is Hollywood. Go to America, the land of milk and honey. It's not anymore.
It's totally different than what they were told,'' says Haifa Fakhouri,
director of the Arab-American and Chaldean Communities Social Services.
   At ACCESS, more than 16,000 families last year received English lessons
and help with immigration, jobs, medical care, clothing and housing.
``The problem is, they need everything,'' Ahmed says.    ``Twenty-five
percent unemployment in Detroit is better than getting your head busted,''
says George Moses, past president of the National Association of Arab Americans,
the only registered lobbying group for immigrants and their descendants.
``America has been good to Arab-Americans.''    As earlier immigrants
join the mainstream, they say they're less tied to the diverse Arab community.
But Arab antipathy doesn't make distinctions between the various nations,
religions or cultures. Ties that bind include fighting discrimination or
problems in their homeland.    ``You get a crisis, like a war in the Middle
East, people pull together, but it's temporal,'' Abraham says.    ``There
is a general feeling of pan-Arabism. One, they have a culture, a history,
a background worth preserving. And there is a feeling that Arabs haven't
gotten a fair shake. And third, there's a feeling we're under attack _
stereotyping.''    Stereotyping is blamed for unconfirmed reports
that Nazir Jaafar of Dearborn may have unwittingly carried the bomb that
caused the Pan Am crash, Ahwal says. Intimidations, like last year's scrawlings
at the Arab couple's home, increased in greater Detroit this year, she
says.    ``The terrorist _ it goes with Arab _ they'll put it in the dictionary:
Arab terrorist. There are no other terrorists,'' says Osama Siblani, who
created a bilingual newspaper in 1984 because she ``was tired of being
portrayed as a camel jockey.''    ``I was in Beirut when American-made
jets were bombing my hometown. And I hated Americans. But when I came,
I saw a different story,'' says Siblani, who emigrated after attending
college in Michigan 12 years ago.    Siblani, like national ADC officials,
believes Arabs are more accepted than a few years ago.    ``It's partly
education efforts of organizations like ours,'' and also because media
coverage of the Palestine uprising ``has humanized it'' in the past 18
months, Bouhafa says.    The ADC discontinued its yearly violence
report. Its 1986 report found the most incidents in Michigan, followed
by California, Washington, D.C., and New York.    Southern California
has the second-largest Arab-American concentration, and another large population
is in New York.    Raising public consciousness was one goal when the
ADC was founded in 1980 after outrage over ``Abscam,'' the FBI corruption
investigation that had agents posing as wealthy sheiks.    The ADC and
NAAA are quick to point out well-known Arab-Americans: F. Murray Abraham,
who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Wolfgang Mozart's jealous rival composer
in the movie ``Amadeus,'' U.S. Senate majority leader George Mitchell,
actor Danny Thomas, heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, radio's Casey Kasem,
poet Kahlil Gibran, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Doug Flutie, consumer
advocate Ralph Nader and teen pop singer Tiffany. In early days, many well-known
Arab Americans tended to play down their ethnicity, fade into the fabric
of society.    ``Now it's spinning, it's going to take off. We just had
an Arab-American appointed in the White House,'' Siblani said, referring
to White House chief of staff John Sununu, whose grandfather was Lebanese.
``They're starting right now, the American public, to realize we're part
of the salad bowl. We will add to the texture of this country, a new ingredient.''

   Dick Gregory, the product of a welfare home, a
black comedian with a penchant for causes, one-time candidate for
mayor in Chicago, one-time write-in candidate for president, a
multi-millionaire who backed civil rights, has now turned his
attention to the war against drugs.

   Dick Gregory doesn't leave an audience
laughing anymore.
   The one-time stand-up comic still delivers jokes to warm up a
crowd, but the full-time social activist soon takes over with cold,
harsh exhortations.
   Today it's drugs. Says Gregory: ``We want our neighborhoods back.
I think there will be violence. You have to be willing to die. We
want people who'd be willing to die, but not willing to kill.''
   Gregory became a diet guru after dealing with fasting as a weapon
of political protest in the cause of civil rights. He joined ranks
with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X and took to the latter's
message of being willing to die for freedom.
   In personal terms, he has brought his once-300 pounds down to
150. Commercially, he has parlayed his liquid diet plan into a
multimillion-dollar business.
   Here in Shreveport, he has converted a small neighborhood park,
once overrun by dope dealers and shabby with neglect, into a joyful,
child-filled bunker against the narcotics siege.
   He is waging war against, among other things, the head shops that
provide the paraphernalia of the drug culture.
   ``His motives are not genuine,'' says Jim Willis, the owner of
Pipes Unique. ``He's looking for publicity to sell his health food.
You can't buy a front page ad, but he stays on the front page.
   ``I think it's real unfair.''
   Gregory denies ulterior motives.
   ``I'm here to protect my America and my children,'' he says.
``I'm here for the same reason people go to war.''
   He's recruiting some famous soldiers.
   Coretta Scott King, wife of the slain civil rights leader; her
son, Martin Luther King III; dancer Ben Vereen, and the Rev. Joseph
Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
all have been drawn to A.B. Palmer Park.
   From a pop-up tent, Gregory coordinates anti-drug protests,
basketball games and gospel sing-alongs. All the while, the
potential for violent confrontation might be just across the street
or around the corner for anyone who takes up his banner.
   ``There's a new hero in Shreveport and it's not the drug
pushers,'' says Gregory, 57. ``It's the movement.''
   But it is Gregory who is the new hero of Cedar Grove, the black
community terrified by an all-night riot in September 1988. Behind
the riot was drugs.
   Here, the self-described statesman dispenses power and
self-reliance by showing people what they can do cooperatively.
   Almost nightly, he marshals his forces to march by crack houses
and buyers' corners, singing hymns. ``No more yard and garage
sales,'' their sandwich boards proclaim.
   It's heady stuff for people who only weeks ago were afraid to
venture into A.B. Palmer Park because the unsavory element had
conquered the playground.
   ``When we got to the park we found thousands of needles,''
Gregory says. ``Now we find bubble-gum wrappers.''
   In late summer, the park is vibrant. Women escape the pressing
heat on folding chairs under the bright blue awnings supplied by
Good Samaritan Funeral Home. One women reads from her Bible and her
listeners chime in with religious tunes.
   Two basketball games are going at once while parents keep a
watchful eye from the bleachers around the baseball diamond. The
cinder-block clubhouse is packed with folks playing board games,
pool and ping-pong or sitting in front of the giant fans. The city
agreed to open the swimming pool.
   ``The level of fear among residents has gone down quite a bit,''
says the Rev. Joe Gant, a local Baptist. ``Dick Gregory has served
as catalyst. Dick Gregory has made us more aware of the problems.
Even when Dick leaves we will be organized.''

   Conservative Shreveport isn't accustomed to the national
attention. Located on the Red River along the Old Texas Trail, the
city is regionally known for North America's largest rose garden and
a Double-A Texas League baseball team.
   Gregory concedes Shreveport was an odd place to land, but he
says, ``We didn't pick this town, the town picked us.''
   Gregory's choice of this city of 200,000 in northwestern
Louisiana raised suspicions it was an attempt to register black
voters before the 1990 mayor's race or a scheme to promote his
health products.
   ``I think it's human nature,'' says Assistant Police Chief Doug
C. Perdue. ``He's a celebrity, a multi-millionaire. It's difficult
for us to understand why a millionaire that could be anywhere would
come down and help us.''
   Gregory arrived in Shreveport on June 6 to set up a corporate
account at Security National Bank, a minority-owned bank run by his
friend, Wesley Godfrey. At the bank, Gant told him about a
neighborhood plan to recapture A.B. Palmer Park.
   So the self-described agitator decided to stay. He enlisted some
help from the Rev. George Clements, a Catholic priest from Chicago,
and both went on a 40-day solid food fast to draw attention.
   Gregory staged demonstrations at two Shreveport head shops,
refusing to leave until he was arrested and the stores agreed to
withdraw their glass pipes, popular for smoking crack or cocaine,
from public display.
   He was arrested and fined seven times in four days in June.
   Helping him in Shreveport are three of his 10 children.
   Christian Gregory, 19, is often the overnight man keeping the
vigil at A.B. Palmer Park. He lies in the cluttered, screened tent,
talking on the phone or watching TV in the muggy summer night.
   ``All night long there are knocks on the door from drug
addicts,'' Gregory says. ``One night it was a drug dealer. It's
almost like they come here to confess.''
   Perdue says Gregory is ``focusing attention on the drug problem,
the way it's affecting the American family. What Mr. Gregory has
done is what we have been unable to do. I'm glad he's here.''
   Perdue has no statistics to determine whether Gregory has sent
Cedar Grove dope dealers packing or just underground.
   ``We still have drug problems in the community,'' he says. ``But
there are fewer drug transactions and dealers in Cedar Grove. Some
known drug dealers have moved to other areas of the city. We have
less visible drug activity throughout the area.
   ``I wouldn't think that Mr. Gregory could single-handedly stop
the drug dealing. If he could, he ought to be president.''
   Gregory's speeches are punctuated with sexual and racial
references. He gets laughs from youngsters when he blames drugs and
teen-age pregnancy on food additives. He tells parents:
   ``You've got a gun and a Bible and you don't realize the gun
cancels the Bible out because you're telling God that you don't
trust him to protect you.
   ``The whole drug craze was brought on by you, not your children.''
   The irony of cocaine use, he says, is that it got white America's
best and black America's worst. He calls the fight against drugs
bigger than the civil rights movement.
   ``It affects everyone. This brings us together,'' he says. ``I am
shocked to find out the level of fear that exists in this country. I
think we will be able to turn it around.''
   Gregory's plans for departure from Shreveport are as vague as the
reasons he decided to stay. ``We won't leave until we drive the drug
dealers out or they drive us out,'' he says.
   ``I've made so much money. I have one company that makes $6
million a day. The only way I can say thanks is to try to correct
the wrongs.
   ``I know America is a better place because of me.''

   For years he has been the musician's musician.
Now at 65 he recalls all the big bands and the stellar names that
have passed his way. Mild-mannered and modest, Louis Bellson recalls
the one time he really got mad _ at Benny Goodman.

   Louis Bellson, drummer extraordinaire, is not one
to beat his own drum.
   When he turned 65 in July, his offstage modesty matched his
flamboyance on stage.
   He chooses to praise other musicians.
   But the most sincere form of flattery in the music business is
when musicians ask you to sit in with them. And Bellson is much in
demand.
   When trumpeter Clark Terry put together ``Clark Terry and
Friends'' for this year's JVC Jazz Festival here, Bellson and
pianist Oscar Peterson were the friends he chose for his final set.
Bellson's wife since 1952, Pearl Bailey, was in the audience.
   In 1946, Bellson got the idea of using twin bass drums. His
simultaneous manipulation of two bass drums at incredible speed is
one of the most exciting and popular features of his drumming _ used
both for spectacular effect and musical validity.
   But, characteristically, he'd rather talk about other drummers.
   ``It's an honor to be put in a class with Gene Krupa and Buddy
Rich,'' he says. ``But I'm not the only one left. My teachers are
living today. I learned to play listening to Max Roach and Art
Blakey.
   ``I listen to Max today. I smile. I'll pick out something I never
heard before. He's the first drummer to teach all of us to play
melodically. Before him, drummers played rhythmically.
   ``Jo Jones taught me how to play wonderful brush things. He was
the king with the high hat (cymbal). Buddy Rich and I _ we remained
friends until he died _ used to say, if we had to pick just one
drummer it would be Jo when he came out with the Basie Band. He was
the first to play with that fluid drive.
   ``How can you not talk about Chick Webb, Big Sid Catlett, Jimmie
Crawford with the Lunceford Band? People said, `You finally swung
the Ellington Band.' I'd say, `Listen to those records Sonny Greer
did.' There was so much magic there.''
   Louis Bellson, pronounced Louie, was born in Rock Falls, Ill.,
one of four boys and four girls whose Italian father had a music
store. Frank played clarinet. Tony and Henry still play drums. Ede
teaches music in Las Vegas.
   ``We had to learn the rudiments of almost every instrument in the
music store so we could give lessons,'' he says. ``By the time we
were 13, we knew every aria from every opera. It gave us a wonderful
basic structure of music. We were lucky to have our father.
   ``I can go to an opera and enjoy that as well as go to a good
jazz concert. It is wonderful to be able to do that. Music is such a
big thing in our lives.''
   As he sold Dorsey, Miller, Ellington and Basie records in the
store, Bellson says, ``I was always thinking how I'd like to go on
the road and play with those bands.'' He went to ballrooms to hear
traveling bands. Sometimes he sat in.
   Ted Fio Rito hired Bellson when he graduated from high school and
asked if he knew a girl singer. Bellson recommended a fellow
cheerleader, June Haver.
   ``I stayed with him three months, at the Florentine Gardens in
Los Angeles. The Mills Brothers were the main attraction. I learned
so much from that great quartet. One night Freddy Goodman came in.
He was managing his brother. He sent me a note to come to his table
and said, `How would you like to audition for Benny Goodman?'
   ``Benny was doing a picture at Paramount Studios. I went down the
next day. I heard Benny say, `Where's the kid?' I started to sweat.
Benny said, `Put makeup and a gray jacket on him.' My audition was
being in the movie. Benny said, `You got the job. We leave
Thursday.'''
   After Goodman, and Army service, Bellson was with Tommy Dorsey
from 1947 to '49, had a sextet, then played with Harry James until
spending 1951 to '53 with Duke Ellington.
   He left Ellington shortly after he married Pearl Bailey to form
his own bands and combos, often backing his wife. And his former
employers often hired him for special gigs.
   One career highlight was playing in Las Vegas for a bill
combining Pearl Bailey and Louis Armstrong.
   Another highlight was playing for Ellington.
   ``With Ellington,'' Bellson says, ``you never knew exactly what
you were in for. When you joined Ellington, there was no drum book.
He wanted to get the ultimate from you.''
   Bellson's latest album is ``East Side Suite,'' a 53-minute piece
composed with Tommy Newsom, plus six other tracks. Earlier this
year, Musicmasters Records also released ``Hot.'
   ``I've got a big band in Los Angeles and in New York,'' Bellson
says. ``Both are superb. Pearl requires a quartet when she performs.
I'm part of that and I still work with a quintet and do clinics at
high schools and colleges.''
   Miss Bailey and Bellson haven't let their traveling, her Broadway
stint in ``Hello, Dolly!'' or her Georgetown University attendance _
she was graduated in 1985 _ keep them apart for more than a month at
a time.
   Most musicians say Bellson never shows anger, but he once got
furious with Benny Goodman.
   Goodman had asked if Bellson's band would play the first half of
programs in San Francisco and Phoenix. ``I was delighted.''
   But gradually during rehearsals, Goodman started to stare down
some of Bellson's musicians and tell them what to do.
   On a break, Bellson found Goodman sunning himself on the hood of
Bellson's brand new car, his heels scratching the paint.
   ``We went back and he started picking on me and the rhythm
section. I put the sticks down and said, `I don't know what you
want. Get yourself another drummer.' I was so mad at Benny I wanted
to kill him.''
   Goodman apologized later by phone.
   Bellson tried movie music in the 1960s for the likes of Henry
Mancini, but found it unfulfilling. ``I had to go out on the road
and play.
   ``If it were all to end tomorrow I'd still smile _ Ellington,
Basie, Goodman, Dorsey, James _ what more can you ask for?''

   John Goodman only shrugs when asked about his
character on ``Roseanne'' and the huge success of the sitcom.
   ``I never analyze it,'' he says. ``If it ain't broke, don't fix
it.''
   He also keeps himself aloof from the controversy that surrounds
his co-star, Roseanne Barr, both professionally and personally.
   ``It's none of my business,'' he says. ``I don't get involved.''
   Barr has been involved in various creative disputes on the show
that caused the departures of Matt Williams, the executive producer,
creator and head writer, and Ellen Falcon, the director.
   Barr, who has split from her husband, Bill Pentland, also
recently was accused of offering $50 to a man to beat up a
photographer she said was annoying her.
   In its first year, ``Roseanne'' was second in the ratings behind
NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' In the summer reruns it's been in a tight
race with NBC's ``Cheers'' for the top spot.
   Barr plays a blue-collar mom who works in a plastics factory by
day and comes home at night to three rambunctious kids and a husband
who's usually out of work. It was the first acting experience for
Barr, a stand-up comic.
   Goodman plays Dan Connor, the husband, a contractor who declares
himself ``the king of dry wall,'' but whose most endearing quality
is that he's a romantic and a dreamer.
   Goodman says going back for the second season of ``Roseanne'' was
like going back to the second year of high school.
   ``It wasn't as dreadful as all the images I'd conjured up during
the summer,'' he says. ``I did two movies during the summer, so
going back to `Roseanne' was like going back to something you do
every day. Like going back to your real job.''
   Goodman says the show got off to a rocky start when they began a
year ago.
   ``I'd never done a sitcom before,'' he says. ``I was extremely
insecure and nervous. But as we went along we found our sea legs.
Roseanne was more nervous than she should have been about her
acting. I always thought she worried too much about it.
   ``We have good chemistry together. She's so much fun to work
with. We're like naughty school kids. We're always messing around.
It keeps the day short and it helps connect us.''
   Goodman, who prefers living in New York and hanging out in New
Orleans, is buying a house in Los Angeles now that ``Roseanne'' is a
solid hit.
   He had been living in a small apartment, but now he needs more
room.
   ``I'm getting married in the fall and now will be a good time to
buy a house,'' he says. ``I'm marrying a girl from Bogalusa, La.,
named Anna Hartzog. I met her in New Orleans when I was doing
`Everybody's All-American.' Then I went down for Mardi Gras and we
started dating pretty seriously.
   ``I'm nuts about New Orleans. Hopefully, in the next three to
five years I'll get a place down there. Hopefully, I'll have little
islands of refuge all around the country.''
   Goodman has lived here off and on while working in such movies as
``Punchline,'' ``Raising Arizona'' and ``Burglar.'' He still keeps
an apartment in New York, where he got his start as a stage actor.
   Goodman was working in a Los Angeles stage production of ``Antony
and Cleopatra'' when he was asked if he was interested in doing a
television series.
   ``I said it'd be nice to settle down for a while,'' he says. ``I
didn't hear from them for a while. I'd never seen Roseanne's comedy
act, but I had seen her on commercials and stuff. I knew who she
was.''
   He grew up in St. Louis and began acting at Southwest Missouri
State University when failure to take an SAT test made him
ineligible for football. Among his classmates were Kathleen Turner
and Tess Harper. His acting idol was Marlon Brando, the ``be-all,
end-all.'' He kids that he's Brando's ``long-lost son.''
   After graduation, he settled in New York with a $1,000 loan from
his brother and soon began to land stage roles.
   ``I was working mostly on the road,'' he says. ``It wasn't until
I started doing commercials that I could afford to stay in New York.
I lived there for 13 years. I sure miss it, but it makes me crazy
sometimes when I'm there. I only left because the work's out here.''
   He had been doing television, but he'd never been a regular in a
series. His first film work was a movie for Home Box Office,
``Mystery of Moro Castle.'' He was a guest on such shows as ``The
Equalizer,'' ``Moonlighting'' and ``The Paper Chase'' and had roles
in the miniseries ``Chiefs'' and ``Murder Ordained,'' along with
several TV movies.
   This past summer he co-starred with Bette Midler in ``Stella''
and Richard Dreyfuss in ``Always.'' He also did one day's work on
``Sea of Love,'' starring Al Pacino.
   ``Stella'' is a remake of the 1937 tear-jerker ``Stella Dallas,''
starring Barbara Stanwyck. ``Always'' is a remake of the 1943 movie
``A Guy Named Joe.''
   ``I'm in my `best friend' phase right now,'' says Goodman. ``I
was Dennis Quaid's best friend in `Everybody's All-American.' Al
Pacino's best friend and police partner in `Sea of Love,' Richard
Dreyfuss' best friend in `Always.' I'm doing Alan Hale and Ward
Bond. Dreyfuss is doing the Spencer Tracy role from `A Guy Named
Joe.'''

   Last fall New York had one big musical _ ``Legs
Diamond'' _ to look forward to before the New Year. Its flop at a
loss of some $5 million sent shivers down Shubert Alley, the heart
of the Broadway theater district.
   Was the Broadway musical on its last ``Legs''? It doesn't look
like that now. The 1989-90 Broadway season could be the best for
musicals in years.
   Eight musicals, including three revivals, are scheduled to open
before Jan. 1 with several potential blockbusters, such as Andrew
Lloyd Webber's ``Aspects of Love'' and ``Annie 2,'' set to arrive in
the spring. It's the largest number in more than five years.
   And the appearance of such stars as Dustin Hoffman in ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' Rex Harrison in ``The Circle'' by W. Somerset
Maugham and Vanessa Redgrave in Tennessee Williams' ``Orpheus
Descending'' undoubtedly will bring theatergoers to the box office
for plays, too.
   The influx of new shows has created a booking jam for the more
desirable theaters. Many of them already are occupied with
long-running shows such as ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les
Miserables'' and ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway.'' Many hard-to-book
theaters have found tenants. For the first time in five years, the
Belasco Theater, a gem-like but virtually ignored playhouse on West
44th Street, has been booked for a commercial offering.
   The fall season gets under way Sept. 14 at the Circle in the
Square with a revival of ``Sweeney Todd,'' the Stephen Sondheim
musical about the murderous barber of Fleet Street. Bob Gunton plays
the title role and Beth Fowler is his assistant who bakes the
victims into meat pies. The production is an adaptation of a highly
acclaimed version done last spring at the tiny York Theater Company,
one of off-off-Broadway's more enterprising theater troupes.
   ``Dangerous Games,'' two tango tales of passion and politics,
arrives Oct. 19 at the Nederlander Theater. Directed and
choreographed by Graciela Daniele, the dance-theater piece has music
by Astor Piazzolla and lyrics by William Finn, who wrote ``March of
the Falsettos.''
   Director-choreographer Tommy Tune returns to the original Vicki
Baum novel rather than the 1932 MGM film for his musical version of
``Grand Hotel.'' The show's music and lyrics are by Robert Wright
and George Forrest, the men responsible for such hits as ``Song of
Norway'' and ``Kismet.'' Set in Berlin in the late 1920s, the
musical stars Liliane Montevecchi, Karen Akers, Michael Jeter, David
Carroll and Jane Krakowski. It opens Oct. 29 at the Martin Beck
Theater.
   One day later, ``The Prince of Central Park'' premieres at the
Belasco Theater. The musical stars Gloria DeHaven, in her first
Broadway appearance in nearly 35 years, as a woman who befriends a
12-year-old runaway in Central Park.
   Hollywood is the source of ``Meet Me in St. Louis,'' a stage
version of the famous 1945 Judy Garland musical that produced such
hits as ``The Trolley Song,'' ``The Boy Next Door'' and ``Have
Yourself a Very Merry Christmas.'' Ralph Blane and Hugh Martin have
augmented their movie score with new songs. Donna Kane plays the
Garland role and the other stars include George Hearn, Charlotte
Moore and Milo O`Shea. The show opens Nov. 2 at the Gershwin Theater.
   Rock star Sting will make his Broadway debut as Mack the Knife in
a new adaptation of ``3 Penny Opera,'' opening Nov. 5 at the
Lunt-Fontanne Theater. The Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical will be
directed by John Dexter, who won a Tony for his direction of ``M.
Butterfly.'' Also in the cast are Maureen McGovern, Georgia Brown
and Alvin Epstein.
   The 30th anniversary production of ``Gypsy,'' the story of how
child star Baby Louise became stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, opens Nov. 19
at the St. James Theater after an extensive national tour. Tyne Daly
has traded in her badge from ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' to play Mama Rose,
Gypsy's indomitable mother. The Jule Styne-Stephen Sondheim-Arthur
Laurents musical also stars Crista Moore as the young stripper.
   Composer Cy Coleman, who suffered the worst flop of his career
with ``Welcome to the Club'' last season, tries again this year with
``City of Angels,'' a 1940s detective musical set in Los Angeles.
David Zippell wrote the lyrics and Larry Gelbart the book for the
show which premieres Dec. 7 at the Virginia Theater. It stars Rene
Auberjonois, Gregg Edelman, Randy Graff and James Naughton.
   Vanessa Redgrave starts the parade of big stars in plays with her
arrival Sept. 24 in ``Orpheus Descending,'' the Williams play that
later became the Marlon Brando movie ``The Fugitive Kind.''
Co-starring with Miss Redgrave are Kevin Anderson, Tammy Grimes and
Anne Twomey.
   Larry Gelbart, one of the men behind ``M-A-S-H,'' tries his hand
at more contemporary politics with ``Mastergate,'' a comedy about
the Iran-Contra scandal. It opens Oct. 12 at the Criterion Center.
   In October, Broadway will also see ``Tru,'' a one-man show based
on the life of Truman Capote. The play, written by Jay Presson
Allen, stars Robert Morse as the irrepressible writer. Its opening
date and theater have not been set.
   David Hare, whose last Broadway play, ``Plenty,'' made a star of
Kate Nelligan, returns with his latest work, ``Secret Rapture,'' the
story of a messy romance. His play stars Blair Brown, Frances Conroy
and Mary Beth Hurt. It opens Nov. 6 at the Ethel Barrymore Theater
after an engagement off-Broadway at the New York Shakespeare
Festival Public Theater.
   Rex Harrison co-stars with Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger in
the 1921 W. Somerset Maugham comedy ``The Circle,'' coming to the
Ambassador Theater on Nov. 20.
   Also opening in November is Aaron Sorkin's ``A Few Good Men,'' a
play about two Marines accused of murdering a third soldier. It
stars Tom Hulce and opens at the Music Box Theater at a date to be
determined.
   Finishing out the month will be Tom Stoppard's ``Artist
Descending a Staircase,'' arriving Nov. 30 at the Helen Hayes
Theater.
   The big December opening will be Peter Hall's production of ``The
Merchant of Venice,'' starring Dustin Hoffman as Shylock and
Geraldine James as Portia. Hoffman received mixed reviews in London
but has decided to do a New York run. An opening is set for Dec. 14
at the 46th Street Theater.
   Also in December, the Lincoln Center Theater Company will begin
its season with a revival of Paddy Chayefsky's ``The Tenth Man.'' An
opening date has not been set.
   And waiting to open after Jan. 1 will be Maggie Smith in
``Lettice and Lovage,'' Peter Shaffer's portrait of a spinster tour
guide, and August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' set in Pittsburgh
in 1937, scheduled to arrive April 16. Also planned for April is the
Steppenwolf Theater Company's acclaimed adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.''

plundered. More and more artwork and skeletal remains are being returned
to their origins, though sometimes it takes a court ruling.    ___</BYLINE>

   Is Lord Elgin on the verge of losing his marbles after all?
   Nearly two centuries ago, Thomas Bruce, the seventh Earl of
Elgin, sacrificed his reputation, his marriage, his family fortune,
his seat in the House of Lords and the nether end of his nose to
bring back from the Acropolis the magnificent marble statues,
columns and friezes on display in the British Museum. Almost ever
since, successive Greek governments have demanded return of the
marbles.
   Now a soul-searching breeze, or at least a strong gust of
conscience, is parting the curtains of the clandestine world of
museum curators and antiquities collectors wide enough for some
cherished artifacts and revered bones to emerge, like the risen
dead, from showcases and storage vaults and return to their lands of
origin.
   The plot may seem like a late-night rerun of an old Boris Karloff
tomb-and-mummy chiller, but the script actually echoes ethics codes
and operating standards adopted in recent years by associations of
museum directors and curators to discourage the booming
billion-dollar traffic in stolen art.
   More and more countries, especially in the Third World, are
adopting laws to protect their cultural patrimony and are going to
court to retrieve millennia-old heirlooms scattered far and wide
among museums, art dealers and private collectors.
   A few weeks ago, Stanford University agreed to give back for
reburial the skeletal remains of 550 Ohlone Indians, some of them
3,000 years old.
   In January, Boston's Museum of Fine Arts returned to Egypt
fragments of nine mud plaster paintings, dating to the reign of
Thutmose III in l500 B.C. The museum bought them from an Amsterdam
dealer in 1978, but recently discovered they were stolen from a
necropolis in Thebes by ``tymborychoi'' _ tomb robbers whose
activities date back to the time of the pharaohs.
   Turkey, which in the last two decades has been plundered of more
of its ancient treasures than at any time since the fall of
Constantinople in 1204, is pursuing a court case against New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art to get back sixth-century B.C. gold and
silver pieces illicitly excavated. The New York branch of
Christie's, the art auctioneers, voluntarily handed back a drawing
identified by one of its experts as a Rembrandt stolen l0 years ago
from an Amsterdam museum.
   In February, an FBI sting in Miami nabbed a former Buenos Aires
police commissioner trying to peddle a Goya portrait missing from
the museum in Rosario, Argentina.
   Several years ago, in a suit brought by U.S. Customs under the
National Stolen Properties Act, New York art dealer David Bernstein
was ordered to return to Peru 745 pre-Columbian pieces, valued at
more than $1 million. He avoided a prison sentence by doing public
service, cataloging museum artifacts.
   ``U.S. dealers import as many as 40,000 items a year from Peru
alone,'' estimated National Geographic, ``many of them literally
strip-mined from archaeological sites with bulldozers and
backhoes.'' Plundered Peruvian art is advertised in slick mail-order
catalogs.
   Hopi Indians are demanding the return of Kachina dolls from
museums as far away as West Germany, where Indian art is in vogue.
In tribal belief, the dolls are ``trapped friends unable to come
home.''
   The return by the Smithsonian Institution of 16 Blackfeet Indian
remains and New York State's decision to give back 12 Onondaga
wampum belts reflect the growing sensitivity among museums to the
origin, or provenance, of their acquisitions and the deep emotions
stirred by their removal.
   An even faster growing public empathy for peoples whose past has
been plundered is evidenced in the popularity of Tony Hellerman's
novel ``Talking God,'' more than two months on the best-seller list.
The plot involves a Navajo activist who digs up an Episcopal
churchyard and ships family skeletons to a Smithsonian curator to
protest the 18,000 Native American remains still stored in the
museum's vaults for study by anthropologists.
   But perhaps the most chilling moral deterrent to fencing stolen
goods in the name of fine art was last month's landmark decision by
a federal judge ordering an Indianapolis art dealer to return to the
Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus exquisite sixth-century mosaics
ripped from the ceiling of a tiny stone church after the 1974
Turkish invasion. The church and the Cypriot government of the
Greek-ruled side of the island jointly sued for recovery after
learning that dealer Peg Goldberg was offering the four Byzantine
treasures, one of them a rare portrait of Christ as a boy, to
California's Getty Museum for $20 million.
   In the usual tangled web of international art traffic, dealer
Goldberg bought the mosaics near the Geneva, Switzerland, airport
from Aydin Dikmen, an allegedly terminally ill Turk living in
Munich, through an Amsterdam middleman named Michael van Rijn. Van
Rijn claimed to be related to Rembrandt on his father's side and
Rubens on his mother's, but indeed had been convicted in France of
forging Marc Chagall's signature on lithographs.
   Alan Shestack, director of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, said in
an interview that ``more and more museum directors are worrying
about issues we used to wink at. We're a lot more concerned about
where works of art come from and how they got here.''

   Two decades ago, under a previous administration, scandal marred
the museum's centennial when customs agents impounded a Raphael
portrait smuggled out of Italy.
   The museum, which has one of the finest Egyptology collections
outside Cairo, can well afford to return the Theban mud paintings,
but Shestack wonders out loud what he and other museum directors
might do ``if faced with the loss of a piece worth maybe millions.
Perhaps I'd try to work out some sort of quid pro quo arrangement,
swapping something of equivalent value or negotiating a long-term
loan.''
   Despite new laws and treaties to protect Central America's
cultural riches, Mayan curator Ian Graham at Harvard's Peabody
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology knows from experience that the
soaring world market in pre-Columbian art has made looters more
daring and better equipped, with all-terrain vehicles, X-ray devices
and stratigraphic drills. They are also becoming more violent.
   For 30 years Graham has ventured into the rain forests of
Guatemala each February, when the rainy season ends, to study a
civilization whose art and architecture rivaled that of ancient
Egypt. But now the race is on against armed gangs of ``esteleros,''
tomb robbers, to record the few hundred surviving Mayan stelae,
those magnificent 7-foot limestone tablets inscribed with
hieroglyphics found at the bases of temples and pyramids.
   ``Looters are busier and more brazen than ever,'' lamented Graham
in an interview at the Peabody. ``Sometimes the political unrest in
the area comes as a blessing. Army patrols with machine guns
searching for guerrillas in the rain forests scare off the more
vicious gangs.''
   Several years ago Graham's small research team was ambushed by
robbers at an archaelogical site in Guatemala's Peten region. One of
his assistants was fatally shot in the back.
   His work has since been interrupted by sporadic gunfire, but
Graham thinks a worse crime is cutting up these stupendous slabs
into slices a mule can carry across the border into Belize for
illicit export to eager buyers.
   ``Just removing them from where they stood for 1,000 years robs
them of much of the story they have to tell,'' says Graham. In his
own writing he indicts ``a different breed of go-go museum
directors, more entrepreneurs than scholars, and collectors, mostly
ignorant of history but motivated by profit,'' for encouraging a
soaring art theft trade that employs a work force of several hundred
thousand around the world. Some law enforcement officers rank it
second only to the drug traffic in cash flow.
   Graham also charges that U.S. income tax laws allowing inflated
write-offs for museum donations reward pillage and piracy. Mayan
stelae have found their way into museums in Washington, D.C.,
Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, St. Louis, Chicago, Zurich, Berlin,
Cologne and many others.
   University of Pennsylvania archaeologist George Bass, an early
advocate of museum codes, once pinpointed the ethical dilemma in a
scholarly report: ``The clandestine excavator and antiquities
smuggler are criminals to be abhorred; museums and private
collectors who encourage their illegal work are held in high
esteem.''
   Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan, told a
conference of museum directors that the explosion in smuggled art
was ``the most serious issue facing the profession.'' This did not
deter him two years later from acquiring the sixth century B.C.
Euphronios krater, ``the finest Greek vase there is,'' for a
reported $1 million cash and $300,000 in ancient gold coins.
   Hoving, dubbed ``The Grand Acquisitor'' for the $300 million he
spent adding to the Metropolitan's vast collections, denied the vase
was a ``hot pot'' and insisted it had been in the hands of ``a
private European collector since World War I'' whose name could not
be divulged.
   Dietrich von Bothmer, the museum's curator of Greek and Roman
art, was met with open derision when he added vague details of its
purchase in Zurich from an Armenian living in Beirut who was moving
to Australia for tax purposes.
   ``Why not an Eskimo moving to Florida?'' scoffed a New England
curator.
   Museum curators have long argued that such acquisitions preserve
precious art for the enrichment of the public and keep it from
disappearing into private collections or Swiss bank vaults.
   Dealers and collectors similarly insist they are saving
antiquities not appreciated in their land of origin from rotting in
the jungle or, as in the case of Mayan temples in the Yucatan and
even the Great Wall of China, being used as building blocks by
developers.
   Peasants digging into ancient ruins need food for their families,
so why not pay them for finding a Cretan amphora or an Indian bowl
that might otherwise wind up under a plow or a shopping mall?
   Besides, in a business where forged documents have long been a
way of life, too scrupulous a stand on acquisitions will only drive
the best archaeological loot into the booming markets of Japan,
where pre-Columbian art is rapidly replacing French impressionists
as a status symbol and a gilt-edged investment.

<TEXT>UNDATED: gilt-edged investment.    Since the mayor of Thebes got
written up in hieroglyphics for ripping off a royal tomb in the reign of
Ramses IX, around 1130 B.C., the past has been up for grabs.    Alexander
the Great, Hannibal and Julius Caesar loaded the spoils of conquest onto
ox carts. Viking raiders plundered the Irish monasteries. Pompeii slept
for 1,800 years under the volcanic ash of Vesuvius until rediscovery brought
renewed destruction by Bourbon kings, Napoleon, the Nazis, liberating British
and American armies, and now tour buses.    Enrico Dandolo, the 82-year-old
blind doge of Venice, diverted the Fourth Crusade from the Holy Land to
Constantinople, and while the city burned, made off with the four exquisite
bronze horses adorning the hippodrome. The pious Venetian had a stone Bible
inserted beneath the paws of the winged Byzantine lion that now stands
in the piazetta as a shrine to St. Mark, patron of the city.    Along
came Napoleon, bent on making Paris the art center of the world, and
the gilt horses were set to pulling a victory chariot atop the Arc du Caroussel
outside the Louvre until a righteous Austrian emperor returned them to
Venice _not to Constantinople or the Isle of Rhodes from whence they were
originally hijacked.    Spanish conquistadors obliterated Aztec temples
in search of El Dorado. Nazi invaders filled railway cars with European
art for avid collectors Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering, whose tastes
ran to plump renaissance nudes. Soviet technicians building the Aswan Dam
sent home scarabs and other pharaonic souvenirs in diplomatic pouches.
   French intellectual Andre Malraux was convicted of loading up a riverboat
with Cambodian temple idols and roof ornaments. The Americans followed
the French example in ransacking the Annamite and Cham monuments of Vietnam,
just as the Khmer Rouge, then the Vietnamese army, further ruined the ruins
of Angkor Wat.    Tomb robbing has been illegal since the first-century
reign of Emperor Vespasian, but every 30 minutes somewhere in Italy
a work of art vanishes into collections abroad.    But of all the displaced
art in history none has stirred such deep emotions or as many debates in
the House of Commons as Lord Elgin's marbles.    In 1801, while serving
as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, then ruling Greece, the Scottish
peer got permission from the sultan to collect the numerous sculptures
he saw being destroyed daily.    For Thomas Bruce, no good ever came of
his rescue mission. The first boatload went down at sea, and a considerable
part of his fortune went to divers hired to retrieve it. Just married,
he dreamed of marble halls for the family seat at Broomhall, Scotland.
Nearly bankrupt, he wound up selling the exquisite statues and columns
to the British Museum for about $160,000, less than half the cost of removing
them from the Parthenon.    ``Poor plunder from a bleeding land,'' lamented
Lord Byron, who denounced Bruce as a jackal, an idiot and a greedy ``stone
shop'' keeper.    But on first looking into a showcase of Elgin
treasures, John Keats poured forth his ``Ode on a Grecian Urn.''    The
seventh earl's marriage ended in an ugly divorce. A rare skin disease ate
away the tip of his nose. On his way home, he was taken hostage for three
years in the Napoleonic wars, nver resumed his diplomatic career and eventually
lost his seat in the House of Lords. Posterity provided the final calamity.
``Elginism'' became a synonym for rip-off adventures.    The art world,
however, is still divided over whether he ravished the glory that was Greece
or preserved it from Athenian neglect, Turkish cannons, traffic pollution,
airport vibrations and relentless invasion by tourists.    ``The damage
by tourists has been terrible,'' says fellow Scot Graham. ``There is absolutely
no justification for returning the Elgin marbles. Lord Elgin was not motivated
by profit like today's greedy collectors. Surely by now some statute of
limitations must apply.''    But Karl Meyer, author of ``The Plundered
Past,'' a fascinating study of the international traffic in stolen art,
said in an interview, ``The Elgin marbles are inseparably integral to Greek
culture.''    In his mind, the Parthenon, where Socrates taught young
Plato, and Pericles encouraged Phidias to sculpt those colossal statues
of the gods, and Alexander the Great piled his captured shields, ``stands
at the very summit of Greek achievement. There is no other case like it
in the world.''    Curator Peter Lacovera at Boston's Fine Arts Museum
differs: ``The British Museum has every right in the world to hang onto
the Elgin marbles, which otherwise wouldn't exist today.'' If returned,
he suggests the British government bill Greece for 173 years of storage
and maintenance.    In the intrigue-haunted world of antiquities, you
can never predict what will happen to the past.

   ``Much blame attaches to those who destroyed so much in those
tombs, and it is the dealers and buyers who are the most to blame.''
_ Ian Graham, curator at Harvard's Peabody Museum, on the wholesale
looting of Guatemala's Rio Azul.
   ``Some of the most deplorable destruction of world art has
occurred with the full knowledge and complicity of the patrician
denizens of the museum and art world.'' _ Karl E. Meyer, author of
``The Plundered Past.''
   ``If you honor the claim of the Greek Orthodox Church,
potentially you denude our museums.'' _ Andre Emmerich, past
president of the Art Dealers Association of America, testifying at
the Indianapolis mosaics trial.
   ``Hell, yes, it was smuggled. I spent between $15 million and $16
million over the last two years on Asian art, and most of it was
smuggled.'' _California collector Norton Simon on his acquisition of
a bronze Hindu statue stolen from a village in Madras.
   ``Until excavation can be replaced by other exploratory
techniques, there is no escaping the fact that archaeology itself,
no matter how sophisticated the methodology, is a destructive
process.'' _ Ellen Herscher, member of the American Association of
Museums.
   ``If the loss of sites continues unchecked, archaeology in 2050
will be a dictionary word describing a defunct profession.'' _ Art
consultant Ruthann Knudson in Archaeology Magazine.

   They were in the thick of the early revolutionary
movements in China and the Soviet Union, a Russian woman and her
Chinese husband, but then they fell victim to the various political
purges. In an interview in Beijing, before the writer was expelled
from China, Elizaveta Kishkina told of her life with Li Lisan and
wondered aloud if China will turn on her and her family again.

   In 1933, Elizaveta Kishkina fell in love with
the dashing Chinese revolutionary Li Lisan. From their romance
sprang a tale of suffering and love that spans the gulag of Josef
Stalin and the labor camps of China's Cultural Revolution.
   Purged twice in China and jailed in the Soviet Union, Li died in
the custody of China's Red Guards in 1967. Mrs. Kishkina and their
two daughters lived on.
   For her marriage with Li, Mrs. Kishkina spent nine years in
Chinese prisons and lost her voice because Communist authorities,
who accused her of being a Soviet spy, prohibited her from speaking
for nine years. Her daughters, prosecuted also for espionage, were
imprisoned for two years each.
   After Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978, Mrs. Kishkina,
thinking political purges had ended, planned to live out her years
in peace in Beijing. But now her adopted country is caught in
another bloody campaign, this time to crush a movement for freedom.
Mrs. Kishkina wonders whether China will turn on her and her family
again.
   ``Of course we are afraid for the future,'' she said in the
living room of her Beijing apartment. ``When you have seen what I
have seen, you can never rest peacefully.''
   The story of this Soviet-Chinese clan covers more than seven
decades. For Mrs. Kishkina, it is a tale of dashed hopes in a
glorious socialist future and of the instincts of a mother
protecting her family.
   ``In the end,'' she said as she smiled at her 15-year-old
grandson, Peter, ``we only have each other. The politicians come and
go, but we have survived.''
   For Li, it is a sad story of a revolutionary manipulated by his
superiors and of love for one's country overcoming political beliefs
and fierce pride.
   ``He was a broken man. He had been used up by the revolution and
by the leaders,'' Mrs. Kishkina said. ``All he wanted was to live in
peace but they wouldn't even allow him that.''
   Mrs. Kishkina, a 75-year-old woman who goes by her Chinese name,
Lisha, lives in a three-bedroom apartment in the western section of
Beijing. Comfortably furnished with a fluffy couch and a small but
ornate Russian samovar, it is high-class by Chinese standards.
   Lisha is a woman of sparkling gray eyes who greets guests with
cookies and cakes. She speaks excellent Mandarin with a thick
accent, giving her joviality an air of Russian mystery.
   Lisha was born in 1914 into a Ukranian aristocratic family that
had fallen on hard times. When she was 6 her father died and her
mother packed up the family and moved to Moscow, where three years
earlier the Bolsheviks had seized power.
   As a young girl and a teen-ager, Lisha believed strongly in the
revolution. In the late 1920s, when Soviet leaders issued the call
to develop Siberia, Lisha was one of the first to sign up.
   The bands of Soviet youth lived a hard life, fighting swarms of
insects in summer and fierce snows and frosts in winter.
   ``In France, they say lovers can live on kisses and cool water,''
Lisha said. ``As revolutionaries, we lived on ideology and strong
tea.''
   In 1933, she returned to Moscow and enrolled at a part-time
school. That year she met Li Lisan.
   Li was a shell of a man. A gifted labor organizer, he had risen
quickly through the ranks of the fledgling Chinese Communist Party
and in 1928, with the help of Soviet agents, was appointed its head.
   Li was picked because his belief that China's revolution would
begin in its cities matched those of Stalin. When it became apparent
that Li was wrong and that the revolution was occurring in the
countryside, under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung, Li was sacked and
given refuge in Moscow.
   Lisha had been hoping to continue her studies and Li gave her the
encouragement she needed. The two began seeing each other and soon
had a simple marriage in line with their political beliefs.
   In 1936, Lisha was accepted by the Moscow Pedagological Institute
for Foreign Languages, majoring in French. But her husband's
political problems had just begun.
   In the late 1930s, a Stalinist purge targeted Li and he was
accused of being a ``Japanese spy and a Trotskyist.'' He was jailed
from 1938-39.
   ``It never crossed my mind to leave the man,'' she said. ``In
that way, I was very traditional. Revolutionary love to me was not
free love, it was love with a higher purpose.''

<TEXT>HONG KONG: higher purpose.''    The day before Lisha's last exam
in 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The couple fled Moscow
and settled in a small city on the banks of the Volga River. In 1944, they
had the first of their two daughters, Ina. Another one, Alla, would follow
five years later.    Li began to show signs of homesickness.    ``He
was a proud man and the first purge had hurt him deeply,'' Lisha said.
``But he loved his country more than himself so he went back anyway. He
threw his political beliefs away and went back to work for a new China.''
   The couple set up house in Harbin, a city in China's Northeast. For
hundreds of years, Chinese and Russian cultures had met and melded there
and Lisha felt at home.    In 1949, with the Communist victory against
the Nationalist Chinese complete, the family moved to Beijing.    ``Now
that was a shock,'' she said with a laugh. ``There was nothing Russian
about Beijing at all.''    Li moved through a variety of posts, settling
as the nominal head of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions,
the state-run union. From one of Stalin's puppets, he was transformed into
one of Mao's.    ``He was happy enough just to be home,'' Lisha said.
   Life was difficult in the poor country in the 1950s, but the family
escaped the early political campaigns. Still, the Communists' habit of
purging and jailing the best and the brightest in their country weighed
heavily on Lisha.    ``I remember there was one day when I just stopped
caring about the big questions, about revolutions and all that,'' she said.
``I had seen so many lives wasted in the Soviet Union and China, I stopped
asking myself why.''    In the early 1960s, the country began a reform
program, led by Deng and then-head of state Liu Shao-ch'i. Li backed the
program. But Mao, who was being eased out of power, opposed it and decided
to reassert control. The result was the Cultural Revolution. Deng was purged
and Liu was killed.    On June 22, 1967, Red Guards, the shock troops
of the political campaign, arrested Li and took him to a house outside
Beijing.    Nine years later, Lisha would find out he died three days
following his arrest. Authorities said he committed suicide, but the family
does not believe them.    Lisha and her daughters were also arrested.
Communist authorities accused the family of heading ``a great band of Soviet
spies.''    Lisha spent nine years in solitary confinement, her daughters
two years each.    ``The worst punishment was that I couldn't speak to
anyone,'' she said. ``I used to recite Pushkin to myself to keep myself
sane but never too loudly. If they heard me they might have thought I was
crazy and done even worse things to me.''    In 1969, her daughters were
freed and sent to central China to work in the countryside. Lisha stayed
in jail.    ``All that high-level consciousness, all my Marxism and Mao
Tse-tung Thought couldn't help me,'' she said. ``I was worried about my
children.''    In 1976, Lisha was released but denied the right to see
her children, still engaged in hard labor. Two years later, Deng
returned to power and started a reform program designed to open China to
the West. Lisha and her family were united again.    China's relations
with the Soviet Union also began to improve. A string of Soviet diplomats
began appearing at Lisha's door to pay their respects to this witness to
history. In 1986, Lisha visited her homeland for the first time in 25 years.
She has been back three times since.    ``All my relatives were there.
We had such a big party,'' she said. ``Fifty people and we were all related.''
Indeed, Alla, her daughter, met her second husband at one of the soirees
in Moscow.    Through her daughters and her eldest grandson, Lisha followed
closely this spring's student movement. Although no one in her family was
an active participant, she still worries for them. Ina teaches at a school
in Beijing where the students were active. Peter was also deeply influenced
by the movement.    ``We can't talk about what we feel about what happened,''
she said. ``But I can tell you that I am afraid. Afraid for all of us.
Afraid for China.''    Lisha returned to the Soviet Union in early July.
Perhaps, she said, she won't be coming back to China.

   ``Blind Man's Zoo'' (Elektra) _ 10,000 Maniacs
   
   The beguiling folk-rock band from upstate New York, 10,000
Maniacs, are an unlikely success story. Don't expect them to sound
happy about it.
   Teen-age pregnancy, environmental poisoning, rural poverty,
Vietnam and Central America are all addressed on the dour ``Blind
Man's Zoo,'' the strong follow-up to the Maniacs' breakthrough LP,
``In my Tribe.''
   Singer and lyric writer Natalie Merchant takes somewhat overdone
political topics and gives them a fresh twist. Her songs are almost
like short stories, printed on lyric sheets in paragraph form and
often having only vague connections to the accompanying music.
   On ``The Big Parade,'' the teen-age son of a Vietnam War widow
makes a pilgrimage to the war memorial in Washington, questioning
the sense of the conflict that killed his father. Merchant ends on a
questioning note: ``Abraham had his war, too, but an honest war. Or
so it's taught in school.''
   Merchant takes the voice of a soon-to-be teen-age parent on the
jaunty melody ``Eat for Two.'' ``Dream child in my head is a
nightmare born in a borrowed bed,'' she sings, neatly capturing the
nightmarish after-effects of one night's mistake.
   The delicate ``Trouble Me,'' about wanting to take some of the
burden off the shoulders of a sick friend, is particularly
entrancing.
   The four men behind Merchant all take turns writing music, mostly
folk-rock with occasional harder touches. Despite the continued
succession of downbeat topics, the record meets the challenge set by
``In my Tribe.''
   That said, warning signs abound. The record hews so closely to
the sound of its predecessor that it can almost be called ``In my
Tribe, Part 2.'' 10,000 Maniacs songs tend to be harmonically
similar, so the lesser compositions veer quickly into boredom. That
doesn't bode well for longevity.
   R.E.M. had a similar problem of how to build on the success of a
signature sound. They succeeded, after a few stumbles. A similar
challenge awaits 10,000 Maniacs.

   ``Blaze of Glory'' (A&amp;M) _ Joe Jackson
   
   Joe Jackson's music has changed in the 10 years since his first
record.
   As part of England's New Wave, Jackson's early songs were
guitar-based, concise and almost hurried. They packed a punch, but
the approach had limitations.
   Jackson soon decided there was no need to rush to make his case.
He became more deliberate and began to vary the instrumentation and
style of his music.
   ``Blaze of Glory,'' for example, offers the sounds of music halls
(``Down to London''), Broadway torch ballads (``Sentimental Thing'')
and Eastern Europe (the instrumental ``Acropolis Now''). And that's
just on Side 1. There's also funk, pop ballads and rock 'n' roll.
   Jackson produced the record and coaxed fine performances from the
many musicians involved. He shares the vocals with three others,
even giving away his prettiest melody (``Sentimental Thing'') to
singer Drew Barfield.
   Tying the package together is Jackson's anger, the one constant
since his New Wave days. Several titles here, in fact, would have
fit on his 1979 debut album _ ``You and Me (Against the World),''
``Rant and Rave,'' ``Nineteen Forever'' and ``Evil Empire.''
   In the same vein is the dramatic title cut, about an entertainer
named Johnny who dies young.
   ``He went out in a blaze of glory ... and you and I just fade
away,'' Jackson sings with envy and bitterness. The convincing
performance is also an ironic one: It offers evidence that Jackson,
rather than fading, is a talent still on the rise.

   ``Eddie and the Cruisers'' was one of those
rare movies that refused to die.
   When the rock-oriented Scotti Brothers Pictures released the film
in 1983, bookings were scarce and business was modest. ``Eddie and
the Cruisers'' quickly vanished. But not for long. The soundtrack
album began selling big. By the time the movie appeared on cable and
in videocassette, it had a ready and eager audience.
   Now comes ``Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives'' at the tag
end of Hollywood's sequel summer. Returning as the enigmatic rock
star Eddie Wilson is Michael Pare (pronounced Paw-RAY).
   In the first movie, Wilson's car plunged off the Raritan Bridge
in New Jersey, and his body was never found. That was in 1964 at the
height of his fame. Considered one of the lost heroes of early rock,
he actually survived and 18 years later is rebuilding a music career
incognito in Canada.
   Pare admits that the first ``Eddie'' seemed unpromising.
   ``It didn't get such a great theatrical release. It's a rock 'n'
roll summer movie, and we didn't come out until October. The
following summer we went on cable and in the first week the record
went platinum. In another two months it went triple platinum.''
   He came into the film with zero experience as a rock performer.
He had always been a fan, had listened to the golden oldies station
on radio from the age of 9 and revered such stars as Elvis Presley,
Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry. But Pare never performed rock until
he reported to the New Jersey locations and started hanging out with
the musicians.
   The actor seems totally convincing as a performer in both
``Eddie'' pictures. ``Rock 'n' roll is mostly heart and soul and
technique,'' he said.
   The appeal of ``Eddie and the Cruisers,'' he believes, ``is a
combination of the story and the music. It was about the rock 'n'
rollers who have died on us: Elvis and Eddie Cochran and Jim
Morrison, all those guys that we miss now, that really never will
die.''
   Michael Pare is a tall, laconic, ruggedly handsome man whose
speech patterns reflect his Brooklyn birthright. He was one of 10
children whose father died when Michael was 5. His first
professional training came with the C.I.A. No, not the snoop agency,
but the Culinary Institute of America, the Hyde Park, N.Y., school
for future chefs.
   ``All through my high school I worked in restaurants,'' he said.
``So when I was admitted to the C.I.A. I figured that was my career
for life. I was going to be in the industry and maybe have my own
restaurant by the time I was 50.
   ``It's a great gig, man. If the kitchen is big, it's like working
in a big family. There's 10, 20, 30 chefs in there. You do four
hours of preparation, then everybody sits down and has lunch. Then
you have three hours of service. It's a different world. You always
work on holidays _ you're working when everybody else is
celebrating. It's a little like show business.''
   A friend suggested that Pare try acting, and he studied for two
years with Uta Hagen and Marvin Nelson. Pare talked himself into an
interview with the late casting agent Joyce Selznick, who placed him
in an ABC series, ``The Greatest American Hero.''
   He also appeared in such features as ``Undercover,'' ``Streets of
Fire,'' ``The Philadelphia Experiment'' and in the CBS series
``Houston Knights.'' It was ``Eddie and the Cruisers'' that provided
the big leap forward.
   ``If you get a hit, more than one person will submit scripts and
you don't have to audition for every role,'' he said. ``Yeah, it
changed my career a great deal, from a supporting character on a TV
show to a somewhat leading man.''
   Pare's greatest challenge in ``Eddie II'' came when he faced a
screaming Las Vegas audience for Wilson's comeback concert.
   ``That was the first time I'd been before more than 900 people,''
said the actor. ``There was 12,000 people out there, hungry, angry
young rock 'n' rollers who want their music. If they did not love
us, boy, we would have had a lot of trouble with this movie.
   ``As it happened, they were chanting `Eddie, Eddie, Eddie' and
taking their clothes off and throwing flowers on the stage. It was
really bizarre. I thought that was just something you read in rock
'n' roll magazines. It was all there.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Poetry Is as Exciting as Mountain Climbing</HEAD>

   Once he started writing poems out by the
juniper trees and bitter brush of the high desert, John Daniel
didn't feel he had to scale the sheer granite walls of Yosemite
Valley anymore.
   ``The great attraction of creative writing is that it is
exhilarating,'' said Daniel. ``It's as exciting as rock climbing or
mountaineering. Both are an ascent. When you climb a mountain, you
often start in the dark and reach a peak where the whole landscape
is revealed to you.''
   Tall and rangy at 41, with a beard and short hair flecked with
gray, Daniel was sitting in the dark mess hall of Camp Cottonwood in
the mountains west of Lakeview, where he spent two weeks this summer
directing an arts camp for kids.
   His path to writing was far from direct.
   ``I didn't get into it through the academic chute,'' he said.
   He bailed out of Reed College in Portland before graduating,
though he was valedictorian at his high school in Bethesda, Md.
   ``I majored in drugs, self-doubt and confusion and I didn't last
long,'' Daniel said.
   It wasn't until he had refused to be drafted in the Vietnam War,
studied classical guitar, set chokers on a Weyerhaeuser logging
crew, trusted his life to a rope on the rock walls of Yosemite
Valley and peered into boxcars as a railroad detective in San
Francisco that he started thinking of himself as a writer.
   ``I really owe it to the railroad,'' he said.
   In 1970, he landed a job as a ``railroad dick'' with the
Transcontinental Freight Bureau in San Francisco. His job was to see
that shippers were shipping the freight they said they were. He
spent weekends rock climbing at Yosemite.
   After two years, he wanted out of the city, so he transferred to
Klamath Falls, located on the eastern slope of the Cascades and the
edge of eastern Oregon's high desert.
   ``I would walk around the yards a little bit and crack a few
cars,'' he said. ``I worked three hours a day for about five years.''
   The job gave him the time to begin writing seriously,
concentrating on short fiction.
   ``I also had these impulses that weren't stories,'' he said. ``I
thought maybe they were poems.''
   To concentrate on writing, Daniel quit the railroad in 1978 and
moved into a cabin on a ranch owned by his friend Roger Hamilton,
now a Klamath County Commissioner. He stayed there four years,
teaching writing part-time in the Lakeview schools.
   ``What I found myself writing about was the landscape: the sage
and junipers, stoves and the weather,'' Daniel said. ``It was in
that landscape that I came to myself as a writer.
   ``I had led a shiftless life. Roger Hamilton's ranch was the
first time I stayed in one place through the turning of the seasons
so I could come to know it.''
   His work, ``December in the Oregon Desert,'' looks humbly at that
landscape:
   ``This space could wear out eyes and ears and leave you wandering
wild as sage, your pale skin cured red, reading signs in antelope
bones, following a prophet tumbleweed over snow and snow to some
barefisted peak where you shiver in the spell of a scatter of stars
one bright as the next.''
   In 1982, Daniel left the desert after winning the Wallace Stegner
Fellowship to Stanford University. There he lived in a cottage on
Stegner's place, studied and then taught writing. Last year Daniel's
poems were published as the book ``Common Ground,'' and he returned
to the Northwest, moving to Portland with his wife, Marilyn, who is
an environmental engineer with the Oregon Department of
Environmental Quality.
   Stegner wrote of Daniel, ``Reading through his poems is like a
long unhurried walk out of doors. They heal like fresh air and
balsam.''
   Poet Denise Levertov added, ``Daniel's work makes us realize that
our unique task is not, as we have mistakenly assumed, to master our
world, but to respond to it.''
   Daniel uses his writing to clarify his ideas and his life.
   ``In the first phase you have to stand in humility before what
stands inside of you,'' he said. ``When it comes to the point where
it is out there, the second phase comes in. It's like a sculpture.
It needs you to consciously model it.
   ``I think it's presumptuous of you to know how it turns out. Your
little poem can be smarter than you are.''
   Through many of Daniel's poems runs a continuing amazement that
out of the universe there would have happened this planet Earth,
with a stinging natural beauty that has become his religion.
   ``What disturbs me about Christianity is their certainty of
things,'' Daniel said. ``What I find fascinating is the great
uncertainty of evolution. What an adventure. What a poem. Evolution
is the greatest poem.
   ``Emily Dickinson said in her terse way that `Beauty is Nature's
fact.' That makes sense to me. She was a scientist in her way.
   ``I think poets need to be scientists. Most good poetry requires
clear sensory observation. Poetry isn't all thought and feelings.
It's about things. Ezra Pound said that `The best art is the most
precise art, the art that makes true reports.' That's a good recipe
for science.''

   Tomi Jenkins likes a ballad jazzy and light, the
way his hero Stevie Wonder might write it. But the singer's earliest
musical inspiration was heavy and loud: the Kinks' ``You Really ot
Me.''
   ``That was the song for me,' said Jenkins, a member of the funk
trio Cameo. He recently issued his debut solo album ``Tomi.''
   ``I couldn't stop singing that. It was so different. Before that,
I was listening to R&amp;B and Motown. But then I had friends who
listened to nothing but Traffic, Yes and artists like that. Man,
this was a whole other world. That started my appreciation for whole
different types of music.''
   He brought that same approach to Cameo, which prided itself on
its appeal to diverse audiences, and combines rock, pop, jazz and
funk on his own record.
   ``There's a lot of songs on my album that can be played on AOR
(album-oriented rock) as well as the R&amp;B charts,'' he said. ``It's
not like I consciously set out to write a song for across the board.
I just write that kind of music.''
   While solo albums are often signs of trouble for rock bands,
Jenkins insists that he just wants a change of pace, a chance to
have listeners get to know him better.
   Proving there are no hard feelings, Jenkins has fellow Cameo
member Larry Blackmon producing ``Tomi'' and is recording again with
the group for their new record.
   ``I had written a lot of songs,'' he said. ``A couple of them we
tried to work into Cameo but it just didn't come off.
   ``My voice was really never prominently heard in Cameo even
though I knew I could sing. I didn't beef about it. Cameo is a
concept and I can only do so much within that format. Sooner or
later I had to break out and get my own musical ideas.''
   Jenkins grew up in Rahway, N.J., remembering it as a nice, small
town, but his entertainment days began at Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
   ``My parents would take us there and we'd stay in cabins. They
had entertainment in the house where everybody ate so I would sing,
with no accompaniment. I would sing the same song a hundred times a
day.
   ``The reaction was sheer panic. They ran.''
   He had some stage fright, but speech and drama classes calmed
Jenkins. After graduating from high school, he worked full-time at a
local chemical company until meeting Blackmon in the mid-'70s.
   ``He had just broken up his band and I was looking for a band,''
Jenkins said. ``I got together with Larry and we started New York
City Players. Almost a year later we had a record deal with
Casablanca and were calling ourselves Cameo.''
   Cameo, which also includes Nathan Leftenant, had a rough
beginning, waiting out the disco boom and enduring Casablanca's
legal and financial battles.
   ``Every year they had another president,'' Jenkins said. ``It
affected us greatly, trying to get the music played. When you have
changing regimes, things are just scattered and we suffered greatly
because of it.''
   But they never considered giving up, and finally had their
commercial break in 1979 with ``Secret Omen,'' their first of six
gold albums. Pop success came eight years later with ``Word Up,'' a
Top 10 single and the title track of their platinum album.
   ```Word Up' was slang for `What's happening.' We heard it first
in London. There were some guys going in to do a show at the BBC and
one of them standing outside the gate is saying, `Hey, man, word
up.' We came back to the states and wrote the hit record.''
   ``She's Strange,'' another hit single, was also made possible by
a little eavesdropping.
   ``I remember Larry and I were on an elevator. A woman says,
`That's really strange,' and we just go, `Strange?' That happens a
lot, a one-word catch word, something that stands out.''
   Jenkins is still always on the lookout for a good song, doing his
best to remember any catchy phrase he happens to hear.
   ``I got scraps of paper all over the house. I try to write in a
book but it never works out. I sit down and work out the music.
Usually it's the melody that inspires the lyrics.''
   Jenkins expects most of his audience to initially consist of
Cameo fans, but he's confident he'll have success on his own merits.
   ``As they get into it, they'll definitely recognize the
difference between my music and Cameo's music. They'll see that
here's a guy who can sing and has good songs, different songs from
Cameo. You'd never hear three ballads on a Cameo album.''

   Author Tracy Kidder has cut through the
perpetual handwringing and debate over American education with a
poignant account of one year in a fifth-grade classroom.
   ``Among Schoolchildren'' is Kidder's chronicle of 180 days in the
life of teacher Chris Zajac and her kids, a racially and
economically mixed group whose parents and guardians run the gamut
from doctors to drug addicts.
   Kidder's previous books were ``House,'' about the practical and
emotional complexities of building a house, and ``The Soul of a New
Machine,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the creation of a new
minicomputer.
   ``For me, this book has much more heart than any other one I
wrote and it's certainly the most important subject,'' Kidder said
of his latest work. ``It was the least mundane subject. It's all
about the awakening of minds.''
   Kidder interviewed a number of teachers in Holyoke, Mass., before
settling on Zajac, a 34-year-old native of the small, ethnically
diverse mill town. ``I wasn't looking for one of those mythical
superstars,'' he said. ``I don't even know if those people exist,
the miracle workers. But I did want a good teacher.''
   ``Among Schoolchildren'' (Houghton Mifflin, $18.95), culled from
10,000 pages of notes, is broadened somewhat by digressions into the
history of Holyoke, corporal punishment, education reform and
teaching. Kidder also follows Zajac to Puerto Rico, homeland of many
of her students. But most of the action is focused tightly in the
classroom.
   Zajac is depicted as a teacher of enormous energy and compassion,
someone deeply affected by the ups and downs of a very volatile job
who all too often wakes at midnight haunted by a child's desperate
situation or her own failure to make a difference.
   We meet her on the first day of class at Kelly School, laying
down the law. ``Mrs. Zajac gives homework ... The only meanie gives
homework,'' she tells them. ``If you put your name on a paper, you
should be proud of it. ... If it isn't your best, what's Mrs. Zajac
going to do? Make you do it over.''
   Of his first impressions, Kidder recalls, ``She seemed so strict
to me. I thought, gosh, this isn't the way a teacher ought to be.''
He soon revised his opinion. ``She was not mean, not cruel. She was
trying to very quickly get control of her room. ... I don't think
the kids were as daunted by her as I was. She really grew on me,
though. It wasn't very long before I realized how good she was.''
   Zajac's students ranged from Alice and Judith, very bright girls
at opposite ends of the economic spectrum, to Clarence and Robert,
emotionally disturbed children from deprived and possibly abusive
backgrounds.
   The days are sprinkled with some rewards _ Judith's compelling
essay on her family's move from a pleasant house to a perilous
housing project, an inspired lesson on the American Revolution, a
chronic underachiever's good test performance.
   But to many readers, if not to Zajac, those moments may be
overshadowed by the children's problems and the strain of teaching
them.
   There was the learning disabled boy whose grandmother sent back a
suicide note instead of an agreement to meet with his teacher; the
impossibly obnoxious boy who once wrote in class, ``Dear Dad were do
you live I want to come and see you I love you but the only thing is
do you love me''; the science fair projects that revealed such
tragic disparities in the home lives of her students that Zajac got
all future fairs canceled.
   Zajac also had to deal with youngsters who repeatedly came to
school with less than six hours' sleep, those who never did
homework, those who constantly misbehaved and disrupted the class,
those who may have been abused.
   At year's end, nevertheless, she is satisfied that some of her
children have made progress and reinvigorated by her decision to
teach sixth grade rather than fifth the following year.
   Would anyone go into teaching after reading this book? Kidder,
whose mother taught English for more than 20 years, said he himself
wondered that. He does not disguise his impatience with the low pay,
lack of respect and poor working conditions teachers must endure, or
the high-minded reform efforts that he says ``seem to leave teachers
right out of the equation.''
   But Kidder believes his book, as it weaves through the sunshine
and shadow of Zajac's year, illuminates more than the hardships of
teaching.
   ``You feel useful in the world. You're clearly needed by your
little clients. There are tremendous possibilities for joyful
work,'' he said. ``It is an incredibly difficult job, but it has a
lovely side to it that I think will continue to attract people.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Harold Bradley Played and Played and Played</HEAD>

   Actress Sissy Spacek, after recording the
soundtrack to the 1980 movie ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' handed
guitar player Harold Bradley a note.
   ``Pick them strings, guitar man. Loved working with you,'' it
said.
   Bradley did pick. And pick. And pick.
   In the city known worldwide for its guitar players, Bradley has
been the most productive. Chet Atkins is more famous, and Roy Clark
helped popularize the term ``picker,'' but Bradley has been more
prolific.
   In a career spanning 43 years, the 63-year-old Bradley has played
in literally thousands of recording sessions. No one in Nashville,
perhaps no one else anywhere, comes close to matching his output.
   ``My career sounds like a lie, but it's really happened,''
Bradley says calmly in a manner that belies the fervor with which he
plays.
   Twelve of the records on which he played with Elvis Presley
became million-sellers. Just a few of the other singers he's
accompanied include Willie Nelson, Marie Osmond, Roger Miller,
Loretta Lynn, John Davidson, Patsy Cline, Tom Jones, Buddy Holly,
the Everly Brothers, Hank Williams, Conway Twitty, Charley Pride and
Joan Baez.
   He's played on movie soundtracks such as ``Pink Cadillac'' and
``Smokey and the Bandit II'' in addition to ``Coal Miner's
Daughter.''
   A few of the songs on which he's played include ``Jingle Bell
Rock,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Stand by Your Man,'' ``I'm Sorry,''
``King of the Road,'' ``It's Such a Pretty World Today'' and ``Make
the World Go Away.''
   For good measure, he played at the White House in 1978,
accompanying country music stars Tom T. Hall, Lynn and Twitty who
were invited by President Carter to provide some down-home
entertainment.
   This illustrious production came from a musician who taught
himself how to play at age 15 and still practices an average of a
couple hours a day. Even at age 45, he briefly took lessons in
classical music.
   ``I love it,'' he says as he approaches a half-century of
plucking the strings. ``I love to practice. You have to practice.
There is no end to being a good guitar player.
   ``It's like you've got this big jigsaw puzzle in front of you.
You put a few pieces in and you get an idea of the picture. Then you
realize there's more pieces on the outside so you keep trying to put
them in. And you realize you can never fill in the whole thing.''
   Bradley, who does not sing, has been enterprising as well as
busy. For sound effects, he once went to his car and got a pair of
tire chains, returned to the studio and dropped them to the floor
during the recording session for the song ``Chain Gang.''
   He has no preference among the various electric or acoustical
guitars, saying simply: ``I prefer what I'm playing at the time. I
like to play all of 'em.''
   An engaging man with volumes of scrapbooks and memorabilia about
his career, Bradley believes versatility has been his helpmate as
much as ability.
   ``I don't know that I am good. But I can offer experience. I've
been very lucky to play a wide variety of music: country, big band,
rock 'n' roll, gospel.
   ``If I played one kind, I wouldn't have been around this long. If
I was a rock 'n' roll specialist, they would not have needed me on
other recordings that required different abilities.''
   He also plays other instruments, joking that ``I play two in
self-defense, the banjo and mandolin.''
   He says his biggest thrills are those indescribable moments when
musicians combine for special sounds in the studio.
   ``When something magic happens, you get a tremendous high. You
can't turn creativity off and on like water. I've enjoyed that
several times with several artists where it was such a marvelous
music experience that you felt something great happened.''
   Bradley feels that he is still getting better except for his rock
'n' roll playing.
   ``To do that, you have to go out and play it,'' he said. ``And I
play a certain style, rockabilly style, pretty good. But to go out
and play like Van Halen and those guys, no, I'll never do that. But
he'll never come here and play the guitar, the bass guitar, the
banjo, the mandolin, the ukulele. So it's kind of a tradeoff.
   ``What you're buying if you buy me is experience and intonation
and ability. But even that can't guarantee a hit record. The public
decides that.''

   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said he was considering a
sale of Continental Airlines because the ``noise'' at strike-torn
Eastern Airlines was hurting the sister carrier's business.
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Lorenzo said
the sale of part or all of Houston-based Continental was under
discussion partly because of the negative impact from Eastern's
bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding.
   ``We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' Lorenzo said.

   The National Association of Realtors said Friday that existing

inflation by going too far, according to minutes of the meeting.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, noting fairly consistent
weakness in housing and consumer spending, voted 10-1 at the end of
its July 5-6 meeting to lower short-term interest rates, according
to the minutes released Friday.

<HEAD>Japanese Ambassador Says U.S. Beef Welcome, But Must Compete</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan will have plenty of room for American
beef if U.S. producers remain competitive in the international
market, the Japanese ambassador to the United States said during a
tour of Montana.
   ``By the end of 1991, American beef can come into Japan on a
free, competitive basis,'' Nobuo Matsunaga said as he began a
three-day tour of Montana, including several ranches. ``Your rivals
are Argentina and Australia, so you must remain competitive. There
is much room for beef in Japan.''
   ``Opening up Japan to U.S. beef exports has helped our ranchers a
great deal,'' said U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the
Senate international trade subcommittee. ``Nationwide, ranchers'
incomes increased about $800 million in 1988, largely a result of an
agreement reached that year with Japan to open a market that is
expected to reach $2 billion annually.''
   Recent cattle price increases also stem from opening the Japanese
market to U.S. exports, Baucus said. U.S. beef exports, most going
to Japan, increased the value of the average feed steer by $75 in
1988, he said.
   Matsunaga was asked Friday about the purchase of the Selkirk
Ranch near Dillon, in southwestern Montana, by the Zenchiku meat
importing company of Japan, and the purchase of a beef slaughtering
plant in Yakima, Wash., by another Japanese export-import firm.
   ``These are commercial talks between interested parties,'' said
Matsunaga. ``Our policy is not to intervene in business talks. If
these investments are successful, I'm sure it will be followed by
others.''
   Baucus said the Japanese beef market was almost completely closed
to U.S. exports until last year.
   ``Although Japanese consumers clearly wanted to purchase high
quality U.S. beef _ beef was for years the most popular foreign
purchase for Japanese tourists returning to Japan _ U.S. beef
exports were kept out of Japan by a tight quota and other
barriers,'' said Baucus. `` The Japanese did agree to ease these
restrictions somewhat in 1984, but most remained in place until
1988.''
   Baucus said that in 1988, after seven years of almost continuous
negotiations, the United States and Japan signed an agreement that
obligates Japan to phase out its beef quota and most other
government barriers to beef imports by 1991.
   The quota will be replaced by a 75 percent tariff that would be
reduced over three years. Although the tariff is high, all
government surcharges and tariffs in 1988 comprised an effective
tariff rate of about 100 percent.

   The U.S. dollar rose in early European trading
today, thinned by the closure of London financial markets for a bank
holiday.
   Foreign currency dealers said that in the absence of London
trading, little movement was expected until after the opening of the
U.S. business day.
   Dealers were reluctant to predict the dollar's near-term trend.
   ``In the short-term, everything and nothing can happen to the
dollar,'' said one trader in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose to a two-month high against the Japanese yen,
closing up 0.75 yen at 144.28 yen. Later, in Europe, it was quoted
at 144.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe at midmorning compared with late
Friday's London rates, included: 1.9643 West German marks, up from
1.9540; 1.6933 Swiss francs, up from 1.6840; 6.6125 French francs,
up from 6.5895; 2.2143 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2055; 1,408.50
Italian lire, up from 1,405.05; and 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1732.
   The dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $1.5642 to buy
one pound in Europe early today compared with $1.5725 in London late
Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid was $359.75, down from $360.25 late Friday.

   The U.S. dollar rose to a two-month high against the
Japanese yen today while stock prices fell for the fifth consecutive
day on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 144.28 yen, up 0.75 yen from last Friday's
close of 143.53 yen. It opened at 144.20 yen and moved in a narrow
range of 144.15-144.45 yen.
   It was the dollar's highest close in Tokyo since June 21, when it
closed at 144.95 yen.
   Currency dealers said that while the market in general
anticipated the dollar remaining strong, profit-taking and anxiety
about possible central banks intervention kept the currency in a
narrow range.
   ``There was not really one outstanding incentive behind the
bullish dollar,'' said a dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank.
   A dealer at the Bank of Tokyo, also requesting anonymity, said
the dollar's relative firmness was due to expectations that an
upward revision of U.S. gross national product figures for the
second quarter would be announced Tuesday in Washington.
   He said the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, stepped
into the market on a small scale to stem the dollar's rise in early
trading. The central bank customarily does not comment on its market
intervention.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which shed 46.62 points Friday, lost another 132.52 points,
or 0.38 percent, closing at 34,607.41.
   Securities dealers said the yen's weakness against the dollar was
discouraging investors.

   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. said Monday
its consolidated profit in the first quarter rose nearly 2 percent

   For the period ended June 30, Matsushita's net income was 52.6
billion yen, or about $365 million, from 51.8 billion yen in the
comparable period a year ago. Per-share net income was 24.69 yen, or
about $1.71, up from 24.27 yen.
   Sales for the company, which markets its products worldwide under
the brand names National, Quasar, Panasonic and Technics, were up 6
percent to 1.4 trillion yen, or about $9.72 billion, from 1.319
billion yen.
   While domestic consolidated sales were down slightly, to 789.6
billion yen compared with 798.9 in the year-earlier first quarter,
overseas sales rose 17 percent, thanks to increasing overseas
production, Matsushita said. Overseas sales came to 610.6 billion
yen compared with 520.5 billion yen.
   Matsushita, Japan's largest manufacturer of consumer electric and
electronic products, said that the most rapid growth in consolidated
sales was in ``strategic product areas.''
   These areas include communication and industrial equipment, which
registered sales of 309.1 billion yen, up 16 percent, and electronic
components, including semiconductors, which registered sales of
189.5 billion yen, up 11 percent.

<HEAD>Forest Service Says Proposed Timber Limits Threaten Owl</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service is objecting to a
bill in Congress that would determine how much government-owned
timber can be sold in the Northwest.
   Forest Service officials say the bill would cause further
destruction of the old growth forest habitat of the northern spotted
owl. The bird has been the center of disputes between the timber
industry and preservationists who want to stop logging in the owl's
areas.
   Bills passed by both houses of Congress call for sales of 8
billion board feet of timber by Oct. 1, 1990. That much logging
could undo most of the legal and environmental safeguards put into
place this year to help ensure the survival of the owl, the
officials told The Sunday Oregonian.
   Conservation groups hoping to reduce the timber sales plan a
last-ditch effort when the bills are considered by a joint
conference committee.
   Under the bills, Forest Service officials said, the government
would have to sell nearly all the old-growth timber currently locked
up by a federal court order, violate U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
guidelines on the owl's protection and exceed its own long-term
timber production capacity.
   Loggers say that if more timber isn't cut, they will run out of
logs before the end of the year and have to shut down their mills.
   The sales target measures, pushed by Sen. Mark O. Hatfield,
R-Ore., and Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., call for lifting injunctions
that have halted most old growth sales on national forests in
western Oregon and Washington this year.
   ``To make the 8 billion board feet, we're definitely going to
have to sell a very high percentage of that volume that is
enjoined,'' Deputy Regional Forester John Lowe said.
   The Sunday Oregonian said the agency's concerns have prompted a
re-evaluation of the target sales level by congressional staff
members, who were briefed Thursday by Forest Service officials in
Portland.
   ``We have been receiving a lot of conflicting information from
the Forest Service about whether they can do this,'' an unidentified
Hatfield aide told the newspaper.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Hit Four-Year Low in Spring Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $27.72
billion from April through June, the smallest quarterly imbalance in
four years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the gap between imports and U.S.
exports showed a 2.3 percent improvement from the first three months
of the year, when the trade deficit totaled $28.38 billion.
   The improvement stemmed from a 3.4 percent increase in exports,
which climbed to a record $90.87 billion. This more than offset a 2
percent rise in imports, which also hit a record of $118.58 billion.
   The April-June trade deficit, the difference between imports and
exports, was at the lowest since a $25.7 billion deficit in the
first quarter of 1985.
   For the first six months of the year, the deficit was running at
an annual rate of $112.2 billion, down 11.7 percent from the $127.2
billion deficit registered in all of 1988.
   However, many economists are predicting the deficit will begin
rising in the last half of this year. They are worried that the
rising value of the dollar will make U.S. goods less competitive on
overseas markets at the same time that Americans' appetite for
imports remains undiminished.
   Today's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance of
payment basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the Commerce
Department's monthly merchandise trade reports.
   The totals are slightly different becuase the new report excludes
military sales by the U.S. government to foreign governments and
makes other minor adjustments in the monthly figures.
   In the April-June quarter, non-farm exports increased $2 billion
to a record $80.1 billion. The largest increases were in industrial
supplies and materials, capital goods and consumer goods. U.S.
agricultural exports were virtually unchanged at $10.7 billion in
the April-June quarter. Wheat shipments dropped $500 million,
reflecting a drop in exports to the Soviet Union.
   The increase in imports reflected a jump in petroleum imports,
which rose 24 percent to $13.4 billion, with most of the increase
coming from higher prices rather than volume. Non-oil imports
declined by $300 million to $105.2 billion, with the largest
decrease coming from a $1.7 billion drop in foreign car shipments.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scandinavian Airline Systems and an unidentified
partner reportedly are involved in advanced talks with Texas Air
Corp. about buying all or part of the Houston company's Continental
Airlines subsidiary.
   The parties have been discussing the form of a possible sale and
terms for some time, and now they have reached the point of trying
to draft a letter of intent, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
   Late last week, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company
may consider selling a minority or controlling interest in
Continental. He said Texas Air officials had talked to interested
parties, but he gave no details.
   Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air, said this morning he could
not confirm or deny the report.
   ``It's inappropriate to comment on anything like this,'' Kent
said.
   He said if discussions with an interested party ``reach a serious
point and a letter of intent is appropriate, there will be an
appropriate disclosure.''
   Texas Air, the nation's largest airline holding company, also
owns strikebound Eastern Airlines. The Miami-based carrier, which is
in the midst of bankruptcy reorganization, wouldn't be involved in
any transaction involving SAS.
   SAS, which currently has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air as part
of a marketing agreement, wouldn't be able to buy Continental
outright because of U.S. Transportation Department rules that
prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25 percent share
in a U.S. carrier.
   Talks between the parties are an outgrowth of meetings that began
between SAS and Continental officials in June 1988, when the two
began work on the joint marketing agreement. Those talks turned to
SAS possibly buying a stake in Continental, and that aspect has been
pursued with new seriousness in the past 30 days, an unidentified
source told the Journal.
   The talks apparently heated up because of signs that
Houston-based Continental could remain profitable after massive
losses in 1987 and 1988 and the soaring value of airline stocks.
   SAS is 50 percent owned by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and
Norway. In Europe, its hub is Copenhagen.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting widespread rainfall in the western Grain Belt during the
weekend.
   The showers were spreading eastward this morning and were
expected to douse a good portion of the nation's corn and soybean
crop with beneficial moisture.
   The weather's influence on the grain markets is decreasing,
though, as the soybean crop advances beyond its critical flowering
and pod-setting stage. The corn pollination period is also over, so
the threat of dry-weather damage to either crop is greatly reduced.
   Experts said the market's subdued reaction to the weekend
rainfall illustrated the declining importance of weather as a market
factor.
   ``We're lower but the roof hasn't caved in here,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 2{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.88{ a bushel; corn was }
cent to 1\ cents lower with September at $2.31{ a bushel; oats were
1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with September at $1.33 a bushel;
soybeans were 7{ cents lower to 4 cents higher with September at
$5.74{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .42 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in September at 73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.32 cent to 1.20 cents lower with August at 83.35 cents a pound;
live hogs were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with October at 40.92
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .20 cent lower
with February at 41.45 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Friday.

   Kermit, Miss Piggy and many of the
other Muppets will be joining ranks with Mickey Mouse and his
friends in an agreement announced today by Walt Disney World and
Muppet creator Jim Henson.
   Henson and Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of the
Walt Disney Co., said they have signed an agreement-in-principle for
Disney to acquire Henson Associates Inc., including its film and
television library.
   Both Henson and Eisner, announcing the agreement at a morning
news conference, would not disclose the price of the transaction.
   The proposal includes long-term consulting and exclusive
production agreements, with Henson producing motion pictures,
network and off-network television shows, Disney Channel specials
and series and made-for-home video programming, the release said.
   Also included are special Muppet attractions and rides for Disney
theme parks.
   ``I've loved Disney for many years,'' Henson told reporters. ``I
grew up on its movies... and I love the Disney parks, so we're happy
to have our characters at the parks now.''
   Work is already under way for the first project, a Muppet film
attraction using 3-D technology. The attraction, to open next spring
at the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park here, will be a collaboration
between Henson and Walt Disney Imagineering.
   Disney will also have the merchandising, publishing and other
rights to Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and other
Muppets.
   Although Eisner refused to discuss the cost of the agreement, he
said ``we will have a good return on our investment with just the
material that is there already. This is not to mention what's
coming, what is yet to be created.''
   In a news release earlier, he hailed the proposal as ``a business
association made in family entertainment heaven.''
   Henson, winner of several Emmy awards, introduced Kermit the Frog
and other Muppets to television in the 1950s. His library includes
the television shows ``The Muppet Show,'' ``Fraggle Rock,'' and
``Muppet Babies'' and the films ``The Muppet Movie,'' ``The Great
Muppet Caper'' and ``The Dark Crystal.''
   Henson's puppet segments and characters created for the
children's show ``Sesame Street,'' including ``Big Bird'' and
``Oscar the Grouch,'' aren't included in the agreement.
   Eisner said the ``non-profit continuing involvement'' between
Henson and the children's show would continue unchanged.
   Although Kermit appears on Sesame Street, the character is not
considered exclusive to that show.

<HEAD>Efforts To Form Big Tourism Company Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to form Europe's third-largest tourism
company broke down Monday when officials of the two firms involved,
Club Med and the air charter group, Nouvelles Frontieres, backed
away from a preliminary agreement reached in April.
   Under that accord, Club Mediterranee SA, France's largest tourism
and leisure company, had agreed to acquire a 34 percent stake in the
French travel group Nouvelles Frontieres SA.
   The pact would have moved the combined operations into third
place in Europe behind West Germany's Touristik Union International,
known as TUI, and Britain's Thomson Holidays.
   Nouvelles Frontieres Chairman Jacques Maillot said merger talks
with Club Med President Gilbert Trigano would continue. He said the
personalities of the two company leaders were not a problem in the
talks.
   Trigano told a French radio station the break was not final and
said time for reflection might lead to a new approach.
   According to both sides there was disagreement on two points _ a
sale agreement Club Med has with the travel unit of the French media
group Havas and establishment of a joint airline unit.
   Maillot said Nouvelles Frontieres wanted to establish its own
sales unit as the West German and British companies have done while
Trigano wanted to expand operations with Havas.
   Maillot said he also wanted to take over an existing airline
company, Corsica Air, and develop it while Trigano preferred setting
up a separate airline unit while maintaining Club Med's close
relations with Air France's charter company.
   Trigano was quoted in the business daily La Tribune de
L'Expansion as saying Club Med would continue to look for partners
in the field both inside and outside France. He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>Rig Count Increases by Six to 935</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
country improved slightly last week, climbing by six to total 909,
Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The increase was marginal compared with the 45 rigs added to the
count the previous week. That increase was due partly to areas
drying out from the heavy rains brought on by Hurricane Chantal
several weeks ago, Baker Hughes officials said.
   A year ago, the count stood at 935, the company said Monday.
   Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations and
economist for Baker Hughes, said more drilling has been predicted
for the second half of the year.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Texas, which accounted for more than half of the 45-rig increase,
was the big loser this time, with its count dropping by 14.
   Among other major oil producing states, Oklahoma's count
increased by six and Wyoming's was up by three. California, New
Mexico, North Dakota and Michigan each gained two more rigs.
   Kansas lost three rigs, Louisiana lost two and Ohio's count was
down one.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Lower On Weekend Rain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mostly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, pressured by rainfall in
the Midwest, where corn and soybeans are approaching maturity.
   But experts said the weather's influence on grain futures prices
is decreasing daily as the soybean crop follows the corn crop in
growing beyond its pollination phase, when moisture is most
critical, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Three weeks ago, if we had had the kind of rain we had over the
weekend and today, we would have been limit down,'' he said,
referring to the exchange's permitted limits on daily price
fluctuation.
   The day's action also demonstrated strong support in the soybean
market at prices around $5.70 a bushel for September delivery. The
September contract's price fell as low as $5.70{ during the session,
but enough buying interest surfaced there to lift it back above
$5.75.
   At the close of trading, wheat was 2} cents lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $3.88\ a
bushel; corn was } cent to 2\ cents lower with September at $2.32 a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to \ cent higher with September at
$1.34} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with
September at $5.77 a bushel.

   A late buying wave buoyed stock prices today and
carried the Dow Jones industrial average to another record closing
level.
   The market meandered mostly at lower levels during much of a
session marked by several rounds of futures-related buying programs.
   Initially, the market appeared to be continuing the downward
trend that developed Friday after the rally on Thursday when the Dow
Jones industrial average surged about 56{ points to 2,734.64,
exceeding the peak reached in August 1987.
   Several rebounds linked to program trading failed to spark a
sustained rally before renewed buying late in the session enlivened
activity.
   Wall Street analysts are expecting activity to be lethargic this
week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend.
   Also, investors are expected to be reluctant to trade heavily
before the release of several potentially market-moving economic
reports due later this week.

   The dollar edged higher Monday against most key
currencies in thin trading as dealers awaited upcoming data on the
U.S. economy.
   Gold prices were weaker. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery stood at $360 a troy ounce, down
70 cents from late Friday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a late bid for gold of $359 an ounce, down $1.25.
   Ronald H. Holzer, chief currency dealer for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in
Chicago, said the dollar got a boost from expectations that a spate
of government reports to be released this week would show continued
economic growth, thereby keeping interest rates strong.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a currency.
   The government is scheduled to release revised second-quarter
figures for the gross national product on Tuesday. Some economists
predict an upward revision to around 2.5 percent growth from the
original 1.7 percent estimate.
   Among the other numerous economic reports due out this week are
factory orders and home sales for July, August unemployment and the
index of leading economic indicators for July.
   Trading was subdued Monday by the closure of London financial
markets for a bank holiday. Financial institutions also were shut
down in Hong Kong for the Liberation Day holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose to a two-month high of 144.28 Japanese yen, up from
143.53 yen at Friday's close. It edged up further in Europe to
144.55 yen, and in New York to 144.52 yen from 143.90 yen.
   The British pound fell in Europe to $1.5635 from $1.5725 in
London late Friday. Sterling fetched $1.5636 in New York, down from
$1.5660.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.9638 West German marks, up from 1.9630; 1.6925 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6918; 6.6160 French francs, up from 6.6115; 1.1717
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1745; and 1,406.375 Italian lire, up
from 1,405.63.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, included:
1.9650 West German marks, up from 1.9540; 1.6940 Swiss francs, up
from 1.6840; 6.6180 French francs, up from 6.5895; 2.2130 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.2055; 1.1753 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1732;
and 1,408.00 Italian lire, up from 1,405.05.
   Gold bullion fell in Zurich, Switzerland, to a late bid price of
$359.25 a troy ounce, down from $360.25 bid late Friday.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell to $5.090 a
troy ounce from $5.108. A silver figure was not available in London
because the markets were closed.

   A late buying wave buoyed stock prices, carrying
the Dow Jones industrial average to another record, while broader
market measures also moved to new highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.00 to 2,743.36,
surpassing the previous peak reached last week.
   The stock market meandered mostly at lower levels in lethargic
activity during much of a session marked by several rounds of
futures-related buying programs.
   Initially, the market appeared to be continuing the downward
trend that developed Friday after the rally on Thursday when the Dow
Jones industrial average surged about 56{ points to 2,734.64,
exceeding the record posted in August 1987.
   Several rebounds linked to program trading failed to spark a
sustained rally before renewed buying going into the final half hour
of the session generated fresh buying interest.
   In the late going, advancing issues took the lead from declines
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks and
760 issues went up in price while 692 fell and 537 were unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board slowed to 131.18 million
shares, down from 165.93 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 157.21 million shares.
   Wall Street analysts say trading volume will probably remain
fairly light this week ahead of the long Labor Day weekend.
   Also, analysts say investors are likely to be reluctant to trade
heavily before the release of several potentially market-moving
economic reports due later this week.
   Among the data expected to cast some additional light on economic
conditions are the August unemployment report and the index of
leading economic indicators, both due Friday.
   Takeover speculation continued to draw investors to airline
stocks and helped push the Dow Jones average of 20 transportation
issues to its third straight record close. It rose 24.90 to 1,492.89.
   UAL gained 3{ to 281{. A change in ownership of the parent of
United Airlines was said to be imminent.
   Among other airline stocks, AMR, owner of American Airlines, rose
2[ to 81\, Delta went up 2} to 80{ and Southwest Airlines gained 1[
to 27{.
   Texas Air rose 1[ to 22 in American Stock Exchange trading. There
were reports that Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified
partner were interested in acquiring all or part of Texas Air-owned
Continental Airlines.
   Meanwhile, W.R. Grace jumped 1] to 37[, responding to a USA Today
article which said several brokerage houses have accumulated Grace
shares for an unidentified client. The company said it was unaware
of any group buying up its shares.
   Texaco, which fell \ to 53{, led the Big Board's list of active
shares as more than 6.5 million shares changed hands.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines rose 1~ to

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $11.52 billion, or 0.34
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.66 to 195.45, exceeding its previous record close of 195.29 posted
Aug. 24.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.74 to 403.53, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index went up 1.57 to 352.09, also a new high.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.44 to 467.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 381.67, up 0.49.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Slide On Signs Of Week Beef Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures prices fell sharply Monday on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, reflecting a seasonal slump in beef consumption
during the dog days of summer.
   On other markets, coffee futures rebounded; sugar futures
declined; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; oil futures were
mostly higher; and precious metals retreated.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .70 cent lower with the contract
for delivery in September at 73.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.30 cent to 1.03 cents lower with August at 83.37 cents a pound.
   The decline extended a two-week-old trend that analysts
attributed largely to consumers' reduced appetite for heavy beef
products during the hottest part of the summer.
   ``People don't fix many pot roasts in August _ they don't want to
heat up the house,'' said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling
Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.
   Gordon Linn, president of Chicago-based Linnco Futures Inc., said
the cattle markets typically slow late in August after retailers
have completed their buying of beef destined for Labor Day weekend
cookouts.
   ``We have a seasonal down in the markets through next week,''
Linn said. ``But we kind of think that once we get around Labor Day,
we should pick up some demand.''
   Also at the Merc, hog futures settled .70 cent lower to .02 cent
higher with October at 40.62 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.50 cent to .90 cent lower with February at 41.10 cents a pound.
   Coffee futures rallied on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange in a largely technical rebound from recent 14-year lows.
   Coffee settled 1.6 cents to 3.19 cents higher with September at
82.25 cents a pound.
   Sugar futures fell sharply in New York, also in technically
inspired selling.
   ``There was no specific news item we could specifically point
to,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Sugar settled .35 cent to .70 cent lower with October at 13.14
cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade in reaction to rainfall in the Midwest, where corn
and soybeans are approaching maturity.
   But the weather's influence on grain futures prices is decreasing
daily as the soybean crop follows the corn crop in advancing beyond
its pollination phase, when moisture is most critical, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Three weeks ago, if we had had the kind of rain we had over the
weekend and today, we would have been limit down,'' he said,
referring to the exchange's permitted limits on daily price
fluctuation.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with September at
$3.88{ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents lower with September at
$2.32\ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with
September at $1.34} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 2\
cents higher with September at $5.78 a bushel.
   Most crude oil futures advanced on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where contracts for delivery of West Texas Intermediate
crude settled 8 cents lower to 11 cents higher with October at
$18.64 a barrel; heating oil was .16 cent to .39 cent higher with
September at 51.72 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to
.60 cent higher with September at 53.50 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures slipped lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange as the dollar strengthened in value against other major
currencies.
   Gold settled 70 cents to 90 cents lower with August at $360 a
troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.9 cents lower with September at
$5.095 a troy ounce.

   Oil futures prices crept higher in extremely
light activity Monday with no news to influence trading.
   The closing of markets in London for a bank holiday also slowed
U.S. dealings.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, rose
13 cents to close at $18.64 a barrel.
   Refined products traded on the exchange also posted slight gains.
The September contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline picked up
0.35 cent to close at 53.65 cents a gallon, and home heating oil for
September delivery rose 0.29 cent to settle at 51.72 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said there was little interest in energy futures despite
a surge of buying late in the day. With markets in Britain closed
and no news developments, the market lacked direction, they said.
   Many U.S. traders also were on vacation, analysts said.

<HEAD>Whittle Names TV Program Advisers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whittle Communications has named a
committee of 12 educators and public figures to advise the company
on its proposed classroom television network.
   American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker and
former Education Secretary T.H. Bell were among the members of the
panel, Whittle chairman Christopher Whittle said Sunday.
   Whittle Communications has undertaken a $200 million project to
supply television equipment and classroom programming to 6 million
students around the country by the end of 1990.
   Education groups, including the National Parent-Teacher
Association, and state officials in New York and California have
opposed Whittle's proposed 12-minute daily news programs, called
Channel One, because the broadcasts will contain two minutes of
commercials.
   Whittle said the group would help his company's classroom
programming to fit in with the needs of teachers and students.
   Shanker, who heads the nation's second-largest teachers' union,
told Whittle in an Aug. 24 letter he had ``strong reservations both
about the propriety of advertising in schools and the educational
effectiveness of the shows.''
   But he said he would join the panel on a two-year trial basis
because ``I believe it's important for my organization that I be
involved in shaping the program.''
   ``If this were a perfect world, all of America's classrooms would
be equipped with the latest technologies funded by school boards and
other government agencies,'' he wrote. ``Unfortunately, such is not
the case, and it's unlikely we will get the needed technologies
without the participation of companies like Whittle in such
initiatives.''
   Bell served under presidents Reagan, Ford and Nixon.
   Whittle spokesman David Jarrard said Bell will be the only member
paid for his work on the panel. He did not disclose how much Bell
would be paid.
   Other members of the panel included industrialist Ross Perot,
Time-Warner Chairman J. Richard Munro, author Alex Haley; and former
Tennessee governor and current University of Tennessee president
Lamar Alexander.
   The panel also included James Harvey, a staff writer for the
education report, ``A Nation at Risk;'' Matina Horner, retiring
president of Radcliff College; Janelle Leonard, director of
technology training in the Washington, D.C., public schools;
Frederick W. Smith, chairman of Federal Express; Kenneth Rossano,
chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's education subcommittee;
and Joseph Scherer, education director of the National School Public
Relations Association.

<HEAD>Midway Strengthens `Poison Pill'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines, a growing carrier facing a
possible takeover threat, said Monday it is strengthening its
defenses against hostile suitors.
   Chicago-based Midway said it had loosened the trigger on its
shareholder rights plan, commonly called a ``poison pill'', by
lowering to 15 percent from 20 percent the portion of its
outstanding common stock that an outsider would have to acquire to
kick the plan into action.
   At that point, all shareholders except the outsider would be
entitled to buy additional Midway stock at below-market prices,
potentially raising the amount the outsider would have to pay to buy
enough shares to control the company.
   Midway is strengthening its takeover defenses just three weeks
after Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp., a Pittsburgh-based manufacturing
company, disclosed that it had acquired a 6.6 percent stake in
Midway and said it might seek control of the airline.
   Midway said Monday in a statement its action was not taken in
response to any known effort to acquire control of the company, but
was designed to ensure that Midway shareholders would receive fair
and equal treatment in the event of any future proposed takeover.
   Midway also said the amended shareholder rights plan ``guards
against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other
abusive tactics to gain control of Midway Airlines without
negotiations with the board of directors.''
   Ampco-Pittsburgh spokesman Marshall Berkman declined to comment
on the development.
   A poison pill alone is not considered a complete takeover shield
but such plans often become the subjects of legal battles in
takeover wars, which slows down an unwanted suitor.
   Midway, the nation's 16th-largest carrier, operates from Midway
Airport on Chicago's Southwest Side.
   In 10 years, Midway's markets have grown from three destination
cities to 51. The airline recently began first-class service and has
ordered 74 new jets from McDonnell-Douglas Corp. worth about $2
billion.

Thanksgiving and Christmas periods, Fornaro said.
   The lowest fares will be available for passengers who begin their
trips in Boston, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, New York,
Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. Fares from West Coast markets will

<HEAD>SAS Reportedly Interested in Buying Continental</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 10 grafs to UPDATE with analyst, union comment on possible
Continental sale.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp., which is considering a sale of
part or all of its Continental Airlines subsidiary, reportedly is
involved in advanced talks about such a transaction with
Scandinavian Airlines System and an unidentified partner.
   Talks about the form of a possible sale and the terms have been
going on for some time, and the parties have reached the point of
trying to draft a letter of intent, the Wall Street Journal reported
in Monday's editions.
   A Texas Air spokesman, however, would not confirm that any such
talks have taken place.
   ``I can't confirm or deny anything,'' spokesman Art Kent told The
Associated Press. ``It's inappropriate to comment on anything like
this.''
   Kent said if discussions with an interested party ``reach a
serious point and a letter of intent is appropriate, there will be
an appropriate disclosure.''
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo announced last Thursday that the
Houston-based airline company _ the largest in the nation _ may
consider selling a minority or controlling interest in Continental.
Strikebound Eastern Airlines is Texas Air's other airline
subsidiary, but it would not be involved in any Continental
transaction.
   Lorenzo said Texas Air officials have spoken to parties
interested in Continental, but he has not provided any details about
the talks.
   SAS already has a 9.9 percent stake in Texas Air as part of a
marketing agreement.
   If SAS is interested in buying part of Houston-based Continental,
the transaction would have to be structured in such a way that SAS
would get a minority holding. Department of Transportation rules
prevent foreign companies from having more than a 25 percent stake
in a U.S. carrier.
   Talks that began in June 1988 concerning the Texas Air marketing
agreement apparently turned to SAS possibly buying part of
Continental. That aspect has been pursued with new seriousness in
the past 30 days, an unidentified source told the Journal.
   Signs that Continental could remain profitable after massive
losses in 1987 and 1988, as well as the soaring value of airline
stocks, apparently heated up the discussions.
   Lorenzo's surprise announcement came a week after a Boston
investment firm disclosed that it holds 12 percent of Texas Air.
Loomis, Sayles &amp; Co., a Boston portfolio management company, has
said its 12 percent stake was held for investment because it
believed Texas Air would show a profit in 1990.
   The possible sale of Continental could doom Eastern, according to
securities analysts and labor leaders.
   Miami-based Eastern is in the sixth month of a strike by
Machinists union members, pilots and flight attendants, and is
flying about a third of its pre-strike 1,100 daily flights.
   ``We've always believed that the plan was to shrink Eastern and
roll it into Continental,'' said Louis A. Marchesano, an analyst
with the Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   ``The sale of Continental would mean Eastern would have to make
it on its own,'' Marchesano said Monday, ``and the risk of a
shrunken Eastern not making it is substantial.''
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 protection from bankruptcy
shortly after the walkout began in March, is losing more than $1.5
million a day.
   The sale of Continental, according to Marchesano, would mean
Lorenzo ``might be leaving the airline business.''
   The Miami spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association, Ron
Cole, agreed, saying that the Texas Air chairman ``may be cutting
and running.''
   A Texas Air without Continental, Cole said, would have only two
options _ continued liquidation of Eastern assets or the outright
sale of the carrier.
   Striking Eastern employees have repeatedly charged that Lorenzo
has been transferring Eastern assets to Continental, weakening
Eastern and strengthening Continental.
   ``Now that the bankruptcy has thrown a net around Eastern's
assets and stopped the upstreaming of cash,'' Cole said, ``Lorenzo
has to admit that Continental can't go it alone, that it can't
survive without sponging off Eastern.''

   Southwest Airlines has ordered 20 additional
Boeing 737-500 twinjets, Boeing Co. said Monday.
   The exact price of the order was not announced, but Boeing
spokesman Jack Gamble said the 20 aircraft would be worth about $500
million.
   The first 10 planes, for which Southwest previously had taken
options, will be delivered in 1992, with the remaining 10 to be
delivered the following year.
   The 737-500, the newest and smallest of Boeing's commercial jets,
is undergoing certification for entry into service. The first plane
is to go to Southwest in February.
   The jet can carry 108 passengers in mixed-class seating, and up
to 132 passengers for charter flights.
   Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, is the nation's
eighth-largest carrier and flies to 29 cities, from California to
Detroit.
   In addition to the orders announced Monday, Southwest has 33 737s
on order and options for 30 more. The orders and options are for a
mixture of the three variations of the 737: the 300, 400 and 500
series.
   Boeing has announced 679 jet aircraft orders worth a total of
$35.37 billion this year, an industry record.

<HEAD>Las Vegas Hotel Files For Bankruptcy</HEAD>

   Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda filed Monday
to put his ailing Aladdin Hotel under federal bankruptcy protection,
citing debt that outstripped the resort's assets by more than $38
million.
   Yasuda, the first foreigner to be licensed to operate a Nevada
casino, reported in the Chapter 11 filing that his Ginji Corp. owed
$121.2 million to various creditors while having total assets of
$82.9 million.
   The filing, which had been expected, comes on the heels of the
Nevada Gaming Commission's decision last week to pull Yasuda's
license and give the Aladdin until next Tuesday to comply with a
list of conditions to allow its casino to remain open.
   ``This was the first step was to get some breathing room for the
hotel,'' said James Shea, an attorney who worked on the petitition.
   Gaming Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the bankruptcy
filing did not changed the commission's insistence that the Aladdin
hire several new officers, inject $3 million in cash into the casino
and disclose the source of recent loans to the resort.
   Shea said the hotel has begun to comply with the commission's
conditions, including the hiring Monday of longtime gaming figure
Robert Brooker to be general manager.
   He said hotel officials will hold talks with gaming regulators
this week in an effort to have the $3 million requirement set aside.
   Shea said the bankruptcy filing should mean ``business as
normal'' at the hotel, with employees contuing to get paid and all
casino operations intact.
   The bankruptcy filing staves off a scheduled auction of the
Aladdin by the holder of a $32.5 million mortgage on the resort.
   Yasuda himself took the long-troubled resort out of bankruptcy in
1986 when he bought the club for $54 million and spent another $20
million in improvements.
   Yasuda was given a two-year limited gaming license in 1987 but
casino regulators became increasingly concerned over his failure to
comply with regulatory requirements and the casino's increasing
losses.
   At last week's Gaming Commission meeting, commissioners voted to
strip Yasuda of his license but allow gaming to continue at the
resort while attempts continued to sell it.
   The commission ordered that the 55-year-old Yasuda, who is
reported to be seriously ill at his Los Angeles home, stay out of
the club and remove his name from any accounts.

<HEAD>GM Announces Layoff of 600 at Arlington Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. announced plans
Monday to lay off 600 assembly line workers in November at its
Arlington plant and to idle the plant for two weeks beforehand, a
union official said.
   Plant managers told crews about the layoffs and the
administration met with union representatives about the plans, said
Buddy Stewart, president of United Automobile Workers Local 276.
   He said the plant will close for one-week periods on Sept. 24 and
Oct. 30. After that, about 600 workers won't return when production
resumes the week of Nov. 6.
   The plant builds GM's largest rear-wheel-drive cars, the
Chevrolet Caprice and the Cadillac Brougham. It also produces
Chevrolet, Buick and Oldsmobile station wagons.
   GM officials could not be reached for comment Monday by The
Associated Press.
